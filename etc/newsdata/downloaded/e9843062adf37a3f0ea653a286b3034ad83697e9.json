In Nora Ephron\u2019s Michael, he\u2019s a fallen angel with an unquenchable lust for women and the ability to bring dogs back to life. In Jon Turteltaub\u2019s Phenomenon, he\u2019s George Malley, a good-natured car mechanic who, when struck by some kind of space lightning, becomes a freaky telekinetic genius. Phenomenon and Michael are surely different films; where Michael can be slapstick and a little on the nose, Turteltaub\u2019s film is a classic tearjerker, one that\u2019s interested in slightly deeper questions, including, but not limited to: What would happen if we could use more than 10 percent of our brains? What would happen if we opened ourselves up to our fellow human beings? What would happen if we tried loving someone who is, quite chillingly, able to learn Portuguese in 20 minutes? What would happen if we made chairs out of branches?\n\nAs was the case with Michael, Phenomenon wasn\u2019t the box-office hit everyone involved hoped it would be. Variety called it \u201csoppy and soft-headed\u201d \u2014 but Roger Ebert really liked it, dubbing it a \u201cgood-hearted story about the rhythms of small-town life and the meaning of friendship.\u201d If I were to review the movie, I would describe it as \u201cincludes several shots of trees swaying in the breeze that make me cry so much it\u2019s embarrassing and I can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d Phenomenon possesses a strange beauty, owing in no small part to its hauntingly exquisite Thomas Newman score. It grapples with spirituality without being too preachy; it touches on climate change and the frailty of nature without feeling too soapbox-y. It also features one of the sexiest non\u2013sex scenes of all time, wherein Kyra Sedgwick, as George\u2019s hard-won love interest Lace, gently shaves John Travolta\u2019s entire face.\n\nTravolta\u2019s performance is appropriately unassuming and eventually heartbreaking, but I believe Sedgwick is the standout in Phenomenon. Her warm, calm, sandpapery-voice energy helps sells the shit out of a character arc that, in someone else\u2019s hands, might feel sappy. She acts as something of an audience surrogate, expressing doubt and confusion and fear and, understandably, a low-key lust toward Travolta\u2019s ability to move sunglasses with his mind. She walks around in gigantic cable-knit sweaters and overalls and does not give any indication that she is troubled by Travolta\u2019s denim shirt, denim jacket, and jeans ensemble. She cries on at least four separate occasions, and each time her face gently crumples. She rocks an imaginary baby under an apple tree and it\u2019s unbelievably poignant.\n\nSedgwick is currently playing a villain in a horror-comedy titled Villains, but I just wanted to talk about Phenomenon \u2014 the shaving, the rocking, the sweaters, the trees \u2014 and she agreed.\n\nLet\u2019s go back all the way to the \u201990s. Where were you in your life and in your career when you auditioned for this movie? What do you remember about that?\n\nGosh. I know I had done Singles. I had two kids. My daughter was 2, my son was 5. I remember Jon Turteltaub being hilarious and adorable and calling me and saying, \u201cI really want you to be in my movie.\u201d He sounds like a little kid, and he\u2019s just one of the funniest people that you\u2019ll ever meet. I remember coming in to meet John [Travolta], and John was lovely and adorable and totally personable and cool. And I remember I took my daughter [to set], and Kevin took care of [our son] Travis \u2014 he was in school in Connecticut. And I actually think Kevin was cutting Loverboy, or Losing Chase, or something.\n\nWe shot most of the movie in Marin County [in California]. I just had a fucking ball, you know? I totally, thoroughly enjoyed those guys. I remember John [Travolta] talking about how he kept going from movie to movie, but this one really meant a lot to him. He had a lot of personal identification, I think, with the character. And he was great. I remember saying, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of movies to do in a row.\u201d And he said, \u201cMaking hay, making hay.\u201d\n\nI remember doing the famous haircutting scene, I remember doing the scene where we fight about the chairs. I remember doing the death scene when we\u2019re in bed together \u2014 I was absolutely dead set on not crying.\n\nWhy?\n\nI think it had something to do with the fact that girls always cry [in movies] and boys don\u2019t have to, and that\u2019s so unfair. I felt like she was at a place where she could let him go and, I don\u2019t know, take it like a man or something. But then John sort of leaned over to me and was like, \u201cI think you really need to cry.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, all right.\u201d Typical, whatever.\n\nYou do a lot of crying in this movie. How did you get there each time?\n\nI remember the day that we shot the last scene, which is her alone on the porch \u2014 she looks at the trees and she thinks of him because he said to her, \u201cWhen I\u2019m dead, just look at the trees and know that I\u2019m with you,\u201d or something. It was the perfect day, and I remember thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to do this,\u201d because it\u2019s one of those \u2014 one, two, three, cry \u2014 which I\u2019ve never been very good at. Especially with a slow push-in on a dolly. It\u2019s, like, your worst nightmare. I can remember just being so scared. I think we did my POV of the tree first, and then turned around on me. And I just remember it was one of those magical moments where, like, the muse decides to sit on your shoulder and show up and all the emotions come really quickly and easily.\n\nAfterwards, John Turteltaub came up to me and goes, \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d It was just so cute. He was all teary and he was just adorable \u2026 As actors, we\u2019re just so desperate for someone to tell us that our vulnerability means something to them, that our ability to tap into our vulnerability means something to them. And I say this kind of thinking how sad it is that actors live for these moments, but they do.\n\nThe truth is, you just never know if you\u2019ll get there. I mean, I\u2019m sure Meryl always knows she\u2019s going to be able to get there. But I can just tell you that most actors I know, no matter how many whatevers they\u2019ve won, they just have that moment where like, \u201cI hope I don\u2019t shit the bed.\u201d\n\nDo you use your own life when you have to bring it like that?\n\nThere was a time in my life when I used my own life. I think since then I\u2019ve learned. I think that you empathize with the character. I think that you build a history for them, whatever that looks like. And this is a woman who was left by her husband, a single mother with two kids. So she was really a tough nut to crack. But once you cracked her, she was really cracked open. And I think that this man really cracked her open and to imagine what it would be like \u2014 then the loss feels very devastating, you know? And sometimes, you just totally feel nothing and do it technically. And who\u2019s to say if the audience feels one way more or the other? I think that\u2019s always the really fascinating thing about acting: You can be like, \u201cOh my god, I totally felt it,\u201d and nobody else felt it.\n\nFor me personally, this is a huge cry movie. There\u2019s something about the music and the score and the trees. I mean, why are the tree shots emotional?\n\nI would agree with that. I remember the DP [director of photography], Phedon Papamichael, being very dramatic. He always had big feelings around how things were going to get shot. But, yeah, the trees were amazing. Phedon is a freaking genius. And that was one of his first movies. I think Jon had seen his work in some foreign film that he did. I can\u2019t remember. But he was like, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta get this DP. He\u2019s so amazing.\u201d\n\nAround the time of this movie\u2019s release, the New York Times described you as follows: \u201cDespite her candy box prettiness and fistful of complimentary reviews, Kyra Sedgwick has spent the last decade bobbing along at the edge of mainstream attention.\u201d Did it feel that way to you? Did this movie feel like a breakthrough at all?\n\nYou know what? I think it would\u2019ve felt more that way if the movie had done well at the box office. I think it would\u2019ve been huge for me. But it didn\u2019t. And that was okay. Something to Talk About was the one that sort of came before that, and that also didn\u2019t do well at the box office. But my role was so funny and hilarious. And I think that kind of popped, to me, a little bit more than Phenomenon. But that\u2019s because Phenomenon wasn\u2019t a hit \u2014 if it had been, I think I probably would have had a different career.\n\nHow so?\n\nKevin and I both say this about ourselves: We\u2019re workhorse actors. We never had that meteoric rise. We\u2019ve always just been \u201cslow and steady wins the race.\u201d Whether it looks like that on the outside, I don\u2019t know. But I feel like I never had that big moment where everything changed \u2014 that Jennifer Lawrence moment. Or that Julia [Roberts] moment, for that matter. I think people think I\u2019m solid and good, but I don\u2019t think that I have ever had that sort of meteoric thing. And I\u2019ve had a sane life, probably, because of it.\n\nI had no idea that it was going to be like the most romantic scene in the movie. People come up to me, still, and it\u2019s the most romantic thing they\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nDoes any part of you wish that you would\u2019ve had the Jennifer Lawrence moment?\n\nOh, of course. Of course. Isn\u2019t it our human nature that we always want what we don\u2019t have? I spend a lot of time being grateful for what I have, no question. But I can tell you that we all thought that movie was going to be a big hit. And we were all disappointed. I will say that.\n\nYour life and career have always struck me as covetable \u2014 you\u2019ve always worked and you\u2019ve always been great, but you also have this incredible relationship that has lasted for a very long time. I\u2019m curious if you think that that might not have worked as well if you had been this huge, huge star.\n\nProbably. Look, as it was, every time I got a job, I felt so guilty leaving anybody. I think every woman feels that way. Guys, not so much, but every woman is like, \u201cI got a job!\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cUh-oh.\u201d Unless you\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to put food on the table and this is our life, this is what has to happen.\u201d Even though I certainly contributed greatly to our financial life together, no question. But probably because my mom worked so much, I felt guilty literally the day they were born. I think that that\u2019s also part of being a mother \u2014 I think there\u2019s not a mother on the planet who does not feel guilt, just a general feeling of guilt all the time. The truth is, though, if I have any regrets, it\u2019s that I felt guilty. Because guilt is a useless emotion unless it moves you to make a different choice. Unless it spurs you to some kind of action, it\u2019s just a hurtful, painful thing to do to yourself.\n\nDoes Kevin have that guilt, too?\n\nNo. No, we talk about it all the time. He\u2019s like, \u201cAre you fucking kidding me? Of course not.\u201d I think that\u2019s the difference between men and women. I think it\u2019s a DNA thing, I really do.\n\nWhen you think back on Phenomenon now, what\u2019s the first thing that comes to you? Is it frustration that it didn\u2019t do better?\n\nOh, God, no. I think it\u2019s so sweet that people are moved. That\u2019s why I do what I do, right? It\u2019s so nice when people come up to you and go, \u201cGod, that was such a beautiful movie. It\u2019s one of my favorite movies.\u201d Whether it\u2019s the spirituality of it \u2014 or mostly it\u2019s usually the love part of it \u2014 I\u2019m so happy that people like it, you know? I love to remind people of their own humanity and their own compassion and their own feelings of love and their own feelings of betrayal, and loss. I think it really touched people because it spoke of grief.\n\nYou and John Travolta have incredible chemistry in Phenomenon. I think that\u2019s what makes so much of it work. What do you remember about meeting him?\n\nWell, I\u2019m such an enormous fan. I mean, I watched Saturday Night Fever like ten times or something. But what really, really connects me to John is his deep vulnerability and empathy. He\u2019s so empathic \u2014 and so am I. I think that we really bonded on that. But that little face! He was just so vulnerable.\n\nActually, I fell in love with him on Welcome Back, Kotter. I had a big crush on David Cassidy when I was a kid. And so he\u2019s a little bit of a Cassidy, but he also has that bad-boy street thing, and was an incredible dancer. I just remember that scene in Saturday Night Fever where his father smacks his head and he\u2019s like, \u201cI work a long time on my hair!\u201d I mean, you fall in love with him. You\u2019re just completely smitten. I was smitten with him. I was madly in love with my husband so I didn\u2019t have a crush on him, but I just thought he had a level of vulnerability for a man that I found really moving.\n\nYour character is very skittish and nervous and frightened about this idea of being vulnerable to somebody else, and you convey that really well. I\u2019m curious if you relate to that at all.\n\nI would say, if someone had told me when I was 21 that by the time I was 23 I would be married and have my first child, I would\u2019ve told them that they were fucking insane. Would\u2019ve been like, \u201cEx-squeeze me, what the fuck are you talking about? I am working.\u201d I mean, I\u2019d been working professionally since I was 16. And I was living on my own, making my own money. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m fiercely independent.\u201d So when I did fall in love with Kevin, it really just felt like there was some urgency to get married, and I don\u2019t know what it was. Suddenly this thing came over me and I was terrified. Because I didn\u2019t count on people. I just didn\u2019t. That wasn\u2019t where I felt like I would be successful. Not as an actor, I mean as a person. A lot of people had let me down and so I was not interested in being vulnerable or connected in a really serious way.\n\nWhat was it specifically about this relationship that changed you?\n\nHe just was the one, you know? He was just the soul mate, he was just the one.\n\nYou mentioned it briefly, but I want to get back into the shaving scene. Why is that scene so hot?\n\nI had no idea that it was going to be like the most romantic scene in the movie. People come up to me, still, and it\u2019s the most romantic thing they\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s like, just me cutting his hair! But it was so sweet. I think it was sensual. Everyone says it\u2019s the most sensual scene. And it is sensual, right? Because he does all these close-ups of the cream going on his face and me staring at him lovingly while we shave. And I think that definitely was the direction Jon Turteltaub gave us: \u201cSensual, sensual.\u201d And everything was slow motion, and the lighting was insane. It took a long time to shoot it.\n\nHow did you interpret that direction?\n\nMy goal was to just completely love and nurture in that scene. I think that was my actionable item. And it could\u2019ve gone into, like, a mother taking care of her baby boy, but that wasn\u2019t it. They were falling in love at that moment, weren\u2019t they? I remember we had to be really careful, because John\u2019s hair had to sort of be just so.\n\nDid you actually shave John?\n\nNo, I was not shaving him. No, no, no. It was foam and then a fake razor and he was clean shaven underneath.\n\nWere you nervous at all, filming something that intimate?\n\nNo. I think he was nervous. Honestly. There was something about that day. He was nervous in that scene, and he was nervous in the other kissy-face love-making scene. I find that a lot: That guys are usually the more nervous ones and you kind of have to just guide them through it.\n\nWhy do you think that is?\n\nI don\u2019t know. I think that for guys to be sexual on camera, and sensual, is not totally organic and natural, whereas women are socialized to do that at a really young age.\n\nWell, the love scene itself is rather chaste. What sort of direction did you guys have? Was there more that you shot and they didn\u2019t use?\n\nNow that I\u2019m remembering, I remember both [John and Jon] were a wreck. And I was like, \u201cGuys, I got this. Let me just tell you exactly what I would do if I were her slash me.\u201d She kind of takes control of the whole thing. I mean, if you look at that scene again, you\u2019ll think John looks terrified. Maybe not, I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019ll have to watch it again.\n\nAnd Jon Turteltaub is such \u2014 prude is such a mean word, but he\u2019s shy. He\u2019s shy. I think they\u2019re both shy, And I\u2019m not shy.\n\nSo you had to take charge of the whole love scene?\n\nI kind of felt like that, yeah. I mean, they may remember differently. But I remember being a little nervous, and then I remember being like, \u201cOh, they\u2019re so nervous. I need to be like, \u2018Come on, guys. Here\u2019s the way we do it.\u2019\u201d And yes, it\u2019s chaste, but I had to take my shirt off, of course. Women always have to take their shirts off. I mean, it was the back of me. But it felt a little vulnerable. And John Travolta stared in my eyes. He didn\u2019t look anywhere else, just looked right in my eyes.\n\nI also really like the way the movie subtly handles faith and spirituality in a way that doesn\u2019t hit you over the head with anything. It\u2019s not preachy but it\u2019s moving. Were there, like, late-night discussions about those sorts of things taking place during filming?\n\nI think that was at a time where I really wasn\u2019t feeling any of that stuff myself. Since then, I\u2019ve become much more of a spiritual person. At the time, I wasn\u2019t. But [on set] we talked about believing in something else that isn\u2019t just what we see in the universe. We talked about what we don\u2019t know and how much we don\u2019t know. And, yeah, some people are in tune with things that aren\u2019t visible to the naked eye.\n\nWhat shifted in your life or in your mind that made you more spiritual later?\n\nGosh, I don\u2019t really know. Nature is very spiritual for me. At this point in my life, there\u2019s so much I don\u2019t know and I have to believe that when I look at nature \u2014 in particular, a flower. It\u2019s like, I know the flower\u2019s beautiful to attract bees. But really? Is that it? Is that the only reason why a flower\u2019s beautiful? Is it there because something is creating beautiful things and knows it?\n\nI\u2019ve always felt that nature was holy. Especially now that nature is in peril. I feel something every time I see something struggling to live in the world that we\u2019ve created for it.\n\nAs an empath and an actor, do you feel like you can tap into things a little bit more than the average person?\n\nI definitely think that sometimes I get a sense of what\u2019s going on with my kids, and so I\u2019ll call them and be like, \u201cI was called to call you. I had this feeling that I needed to call you.\u201d And they\u2019ll be like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s funny because \u2026\u201d So yeah. I usually have a sense about the people that I really love a lot. And yeah, I see things. It\u2019s weird.\n\nSometimes I\u2019m in a situation where I\u2019m working with people I don\u2019t know, and then I meet somebody and they act a certain way, and I\u2019m like, \u201cI wonder if it\u2019s because of blah, blah, blah.\u201d And then I find out that that\u2019s the reason. It\u2019s hard to explain. But I think that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing, being hypervigilant about other people in a way that\u2019s probably not all healthy. How are they feeling? Are they okay? How are they feeling? Are they okay?\n\nI have a little bit of that hypervigilance, too. And it can definitely get exhausting.\n\nRight. It is, it\u2019s exhausting. And then people like us like to be alone. We really need to spend some time alone because it\u2019s too exhausting to be around people and their feelings.\n\nThere\u2019s another scene that really sticks with me: When you guys are sitting under the tree, near the end of the film, and he asks you to pretend you\u2019re rocking a child. You get this really beautiful expression. Do you remember filming that? Were you thinking of your own kids?\n\nGod, that was so beautiful. And I totally did. I used my kid.\n\nDo you show your work to your kids?\n\nMy kids have no interest in seeing our work. At all. I mean, seriously, from the time they were little. I honestly don\u2019t even know if they\u2019ve seen that movie. They probably haven\u2019t.\n\nYou should show them this one!\n\n[Laughs.] \u201cYou must sit down and watch mommy\u2019s work from 30 years ago.\u201d No. No, that wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nRelated", "description": "And John Travolta\u2019s sex-scene nerves, why she never had her \u201cJennifer Lawrence\u201d moment, and falling in love with Kevin Bacon.", "authors": ["Rachel Handler"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/24/24-kyra-sedgwick-role-call.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
