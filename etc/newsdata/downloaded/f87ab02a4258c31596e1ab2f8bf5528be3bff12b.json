Speculations on US-China trade talks rock markets", "language": "en", "text": "As trade talks between the US and China unfold in Washington, a series of conflicting news reports have thrown markets into confusion, with US and Asian futures indexes briefly dropping upon news the talks had ended in failure.\n\nMarkets saw series of ups and downs on Thursday morning as investors awaited developments in the talks to resolve an ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing, which are now in their third day. Led by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and US trade representative Robert Lighthizer, the meetings have been a source of anxiety for investors.\n\nThe South China Morning Post (SCMP) sent US stock futures into a tailspin, reporting that the negotiations had reached an impasse with \u201cno progress,\u201d and that Liu \u201cmay leave earlier than expected.\u201d\n\nDow Futures recovers morning loss. pic.twitter.com/fgoV34DSbb \u2014 IHSG Journal (@aldotjahjadi8) October 10, 2019\n\nDow futures fell by 300 points almost immediately, with futures on the S&P and the Nasdaq Composite each taking a 1 percent hit. Asian exchanges also responded with alarm, with the Nikkei slipping more than half a percentage point, and similar drops on Mainland China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index.\n\nWhite House officials soon responded to the report, however, dismissing any rumors that Liu had plans to leave Washington early and assuaging some of the fears.\n\nAlso on rt.com US blacklists major Chinese AI startups 2 days ahead of trade talks\n\nA mere hours after the pessimistic piece in the SCMP, the New York Times ran a story singing an entirely different tune, reporting plans in Washington to loosen restrictions on Chinese telecom giant Huawei \u2013 which was placed on a US trade \u201cblacklist\u201d in May \u2013 allowing some business in \u201cnonsensitive goods.\u201d The happier news pared some of the losses on US and Asian markets alike.\n\nMarkets also rallied after Bloomberg reported the Trump administration was considering whether to revive a previously inked currency deal with Beijing, part of a larger pact which could see scheduled tariff hikes put on pause. Bringing back the agreement could be an early sign US-China relations are warming up after over a year of tariff wars.\n\nAlso on rt.com Countries resisting US pressure to ban Huawei\u2019s 5G equipment\n\nNotwithstanding the SCMP report, by all indications the talks are set to continue in Washington on Thursday and Friday, when higher level meetings will reportedly take place. It remains to be seen what deals \u2013 or lack of them \u2013 might result, however for the moment it appears markets have settled on a cautious optimism.\n\nLike this story?
