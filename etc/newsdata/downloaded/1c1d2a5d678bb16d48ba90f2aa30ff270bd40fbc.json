Hopefully tomorrow a necropsy will be carried out to determine the cause of death #thameswhale #HumpbackWhale'.\n\nRare sightings of the whale had delighted onlookers and whale watchers, who flocked to the banks of the Thames to catch a glimpse of the elusive animal.\n\nBut on Monday afternoon, a resident had spotted the 32ft whale struggling in shallow water and in danger of stranding, the charity wrote on their website.\n\nMr Stevens confirmed he had seen a photo of the whale's carcass this evening, which had likely been floating with the tide.\n\nA Port of London Authority boat has been dispatched to retrieve the body, and a post mortem will be carried out tomorrow to determine the cause of death\n\nHe told the publication: 'The body will need to be recovered, my guess is by the Port of London Authority as it's a hazard to shipping. I imagine they'll do that first thing tomorrow.'\n\nExperts say it is likely the juvenile whale made a navigational error and swam up the Thames from the North Sea last week on a spring tide when the water level was at its highest.\n\nThe whale had been swimming back and forth from Tilbury to Erith, with experts hoping it would make its way back to sea.\n\nBut today it was feared the whale could have been stuck for up to a week in the Thames until there was another spring tide raising water levels again.\n\nThe mammal, nicknamed Hessy, has been spotted several times since the weekend, with the latest sighting near Erith Reach, around five miles west of Greenhithe\n\nIt is believed there was not enough food for the creature, thought to be 25-32ft long and low on fat reserves.\n\nAnother humpback whale which entered the Thames 10 years ago is known to have died of starvation.\n\nWhile Benny the beluga who set up home in the river last year could use sonar to target prey such as crabs on the bottom, the humpback is a filter feeder taking in vast amounts of water to catch fish.\n\nExperts believe the juvenile whale made a navigational error and swam up the Thames from the North Sea last week on a spring tide when the water level is at its highest\n\nBefore the whale's death, Julia Cable of the British Divers' Marine Life Rescue charity said it had been relying on vital fat reserves to stay alive.\n\nWhat is a spring tide in the River Thames? Parts of the River Thames is tidal, due to water flowing from the North Sea. Before Teddington Lock was installed, the river was tidal as far as Staines, about 16 miles (26 km) upstream. The tidal stretch of the river is known as 'the Tideway', and are often recorded at London Bridge. A spring tide - a tide just after a new or full moon - is when there is the greatest difference between high and low water. The last spring high tide at London Bridge was on October 1, with the next on October 17.\n\nShe said: 'From photographs we have seen, it doesn't seem to have a lot of fat reserves.\n\n'It is swimming up and down the river so it is using more and more reserves all the time.'\n\nThe charity did not sent any boats out to monitor the whale as it was feared it could stress the animal.\n\nThe whale has signs of 'historic entanglement' scarring on its dorsal fin but looks unharmed apart from that.\n\nA small group of whale watchers have gathered at Greenhithe today in the hope of catching a glimpse of the mammal after it was first spotted near Dartford Bridge in Kent on Sunday.\n\nLinton Hopkins, 50, ventured out to see his third whale in the Thames.\n\n'At the moment I'm not too confident of seeing it, hopefully it's gone.\n\n'It's a wild creature and shouldn't be here. It would be nice to see it but ideally it will have swam out.\n\n'It will be very confused and very frightened. They're sea creatures after all. They're deep diving animals and it's not deep enough to dive here.\n\nThe whale has signs of 'historic entanglement' scarring on its dorsal fin but looks unharmed apart from that\n\n'I wonder what it's feeding on, there's not a lot for it to eat here.'\n\nThis will be the third whale Mr Hopkins has seen, having snapped Benny the Beluga last year and the headline making mammal that swam through central London in 2006.\n\nHe said: 'I saw the beluga in Gravesend last year and I saw the whale in central. That was amazing - it was right outside my office I was very lucky.\n\n'I had to come today. It would be nice to see but it would be better if was out at sea.\n\n'Obviously it would be nice to see but ideally it would be gone.'", "description": "The aquatic mammal, nicknamed Hessy, had been travelling back and forth over a stretch of five miles  after it was first sighted near Dartford Bridge in Kent on Sunday.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/20/19457376-0-image-a-29_1570562100254.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
