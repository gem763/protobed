On August 10, 2019, he died in an apparent jailhouse suicide. For more information, see The Daily Beast's reporting here.\n\nBillionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein may have stopped trumpeting his million-dollar donations to charities in light of accusations he molested dozens of underage girls. But he continues to quietly distribute his wealth\u2014including to the nonprofits of Deepak Chopra, Elton John and a doctor linked to President Trump\u2014through a shadowy private foundation called \u201cGratitude America, Ltd.,\u201d The Daily Beast has learned.\n\nGratitude America, Ltd. was launched in 2012 to back \u201corganizations around the world that seek to celebrate the United States of America and the American Ideals,\u201d the group stated in its application for tax-exempt status. Those ideals, the nonprofit added, include \u201cliberty, equality, democracy, individualism, unity, and diversity.\u201d At the time, Epstein was three years out of jail, but disturbing allegations from his alleged victims, including one who claimed Epstein kept her as a \u201csex slave\u201d for his famous friends, continued to hound him.\n\nEpstein apparently needed some favorable news to change the narrative and embarked on a public relations crusade that depicted him as a renowned \u201cscience philanthropist,\u201d rather than a convicted sex offender.\n\nNot to be confused with GratitudeAmerica, Inc., a Florida nonprofit for veterans, Epstein\u2019s latest private foundation doesn\u2019t appear to have a website or online presence. The only traces of the group lie in tax returns, a fundraising site for multiple sclerosis, and a book of abstracts from a 2017 academic conference in California.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, Gratitude America Ltd. funded an all-girls school in Manhattan, a youth tennis program, cancer charities, Harvard\u2019s famous theater troupe, posh New York arts societies at Lincoln Center and the Met Orchestra Musicians, and a nonprofit linked to the wife of a former Harvard president who flew on Epstein\u2019s private jet, dubbed the \u201cLolita Express\u201d by the press.\n\nIndeed, a review of tax returns reveals Epstein\u2019s foundation donated at least $1.84 million to host of causes, including $15,000 to the Hewitt School, the elite private girls school on the Upper East Side; $30,000 to the O\u2019Gorman Garden, a Harlem preschool; and $25,000 to the Junior Tennis Champions Center in College Park, Maryland.\n\nGratitude America\u2019s biggest donations included a $375,000 payout to the International Peace Institute Inc., a New York think tank staffed by former United Nations officials and run by Norwegian diplomat Terje R\u00f8d-Larsen, and $225,000 to the Melanoma Research Alliance\u2014both of which Epstein boasted of supporting financially in years past.\n\nAs The Daily Beast previously reported, Epstein once cultivated a web presence that portrayed a multi-hyphenate superhero: an \u201carmistice activist\u201d with the peace institute; one of the largest funders of scientists around the world\u201d who helped to curb ivory poaching; and an \u201ceducation activist\u201d who delivered the Virgin Islands its first Head Start program.\n\nYet the 66-year-old financier\u2019s philanthropy has failed to repair his reputation.\n\nIn the early Aughts, Epstein was known to rub elbows with the likes of Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Woody Allen and Kevin Spacey. His enigmatic rise from Dalton physics teacher to \u201cinternational moneyman of mystery\u201d who palled around with Prince Andrew and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was chronicled by the tabloids and New York magazine and Vanity Fair, which in 2003 reported, \u201cEpstein is known about town as a man who loves women\u2014lots of them, mostly young.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s reckless, and he\u2019s gotten more so,\u201d one former business associate told Vanity Fair of Epstein, who owns mansions in Palm Beach, Florida and Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, along with a ranch in New Mexico. \u201cMoney does that to you. He\u2019s breaking the oath he made to himself\u2014that he would never do anything that would expose him in the media.\u201d\n\nTrump, too, once alluded to Epstein\u2019s penchant for younger women. \u201cI\u2019ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,\u201d Trump told New York in 2002. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it\u2014Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\u201d\n\nFour years later, Epstein was arrested after this \u201csocial life\u201d became the subject of a 13-month investigation by Palm Beach detectives.\n\nPolice say Epstein was sexually abusing girls as young as 13, many of them from poor families and broken homes. And, according to lawsuits filed by victims, Epstein loaned them out to his famous friends. Epstein also allegedly paid girls to recruit other teen victims, telling one recruiter, \u201cThe younger, the better.\u201d (The money manager denied trafficking girls to his friends, saying in one court filing that he and his pals were \u201cthe subject of the most outlandish and offensive attacks, allegations, and plain inventions.\u201d)\n\nAuthorities had enough evidence to send Epstein to prison for life. But under a suspiciously sweet plea deal inked with former U.S. Attorney and current Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, Epstein served only 13 months of an 18-month sentence inside a private wing of the county stockade, mostly on \u201cwork release\u201d for 16 hours a day, six days a week.\n\nEpstein pleaded guilty to two state charges: solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution. Now the Department of Justice is investigating that secret plea agreement, which a federal judge ruled violated the law, and whether Acosta and other prosecutors \u201ccommitted professional misconduct.\u201d\n\nIn the #MeToo era, calls for justice for Epstein\u2019s alleged victims are growing louder. The Miami Herald and Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims Epstein forced her to have sex with Prince Andrew and Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz (allegations all three men vehemently deny), are fighting to unseal court records in a defamation lawsuit Giuffre filed against Epstein\u2019s friend, Ghislaine Maxwell. Lawyers for Epstein\u2019s alleged victims say records will show Epstein and Maxwell trafficked girls for the benefit of their high-flying friends. Maxwell, who has denied Giuffre\u2019s claims, settled the case on the eve of trial in 2017.\n\nLast week, the New York Post revealed that the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office had \u201cgraphic and detailed evidence\u201d of Epstein\u2019s assault of minor girls before it argued for leniency during a 2011 sex-offender registration hearing. At the time, a judge balked at the DA\u2019s request to register Epstein as a \u201clow risk\u201d offender, saying, \u201cI have to tell you, I\u2019m a little overwhelmed because I have never seen the prosecutor\u2019s office do anything like this.\u201d\n\nThe constant trickle of bad press has resulted in some charities and political candidates keeping their distance from the perverted hedge-funder.\n\nIn 2006, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said he\u2019d distribute Epstein\u2019s $50,000 campaign donation to charities throughout the state, while New York\u2019s gubernatorial candidate Eliot Spitzer and attorney general hopeful Mark Green returned donations of $50,000 and $10,000, respectively, from the billionaire.\n\nIn 2015, nonprofits including Florida\u2019s Ballet Palm Beach told Reuters they\u2019d no longer accept Epstein\u2019s money following Giuffre\u2019s headline-grabbing allegations. \u201cThe further I can keep myself from anything like that the better,\u201d the ballet\u2019s founder said.\n\nWhen Epstein tried donating to House Democrats last October, they quickly returned a $10,000 offering from the political pariah. One spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee told The Daily Beast, \u201cWithout second thought, the DCCC immediately refunded this unsolicited donation.\u201d\n\nStill, others have quietly welcomed Epstein\u2019s cash. His former charity, the C.O.U.Q. Foundation, donated $25,000 to Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s charity, according to C.O.U.Q.\u2019s 2006 tax return. The group is listed among past and present donors on the Clinton Foundation\u2019s website.\n\nHarvard also kept a $6.5-million check from Epstein to fund the university\u2019s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, the Harvard Crimson reported in 2006.\n\nIn March of this year, The Daily Beast revealed Epstein had funded the nonprofit of a Russian model who advocates for women entrepreneurs.\n\nAnd Harvard\u2019s Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, which includes the university\u2019s historic theater troupe, noted Epstein among its top donors in 2018, under the category \u201cThe Guardians of the Sphinx.\u201d\n\nDirty Money\n\nIn the year leading up to Gratitude America\u2019s creation, Epstein\u2019s connections with his prominent friends were under scrutiny. One of his alleged victims, Virginia Roberts, came forward to the Daily Mail in February 2011, to say she was only 15 when Epstein recruited her \u201cto be a prostitute for him and his friends,\u201d including Prince Andrew.\n\nThe same month, Epstein downplayed his Florida conviction, telling the New York Post, \u201cI\u2019m not a sexual predator, I\u2019m an \u2018offender\u2019. It\u2019s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.\u201d These comments followed a New York judge\u2019s ruling that Epstein must register as a Level 3 sex offender, which meant he\u2019s at \u201chigh risk of repeat offense and a threat to public safety exists.\u201d\n\nThe shocking allegations didn\u2019t stop Epstein, however, from issuing a flurry of press releases heralding his support of the sciences. In January 2012, \u201cThe Jeffrey Epstein Foundation\u201d announced its sponsorship of a conference organized by MIT\u2019s Marvin Minsky, under the headline, \u201cTop Scientists Meet to Discuss Greatest Threats to the Earth.\u201d\n\nIn March 2012, another announcement declared, \u201cScience Philanthropist, Jeffrey Epstein, Convenes a Conference of Nobel Laureates to Define Gravity.\u201d It was followed days later with a different bulletin: \u201cJeffrey Epstein, Science Philanthropist, Organizes a Global Doomsday Conference.\u201d\n\nOne month later, Gratitude America Ltd. was formed in the Virgin Islands \u201cto support the expression of gratitude for the ideals of America,\u201d according to a tax-exempt application filed with the Internal Revenue Service. (Epstein has specified the Virgin Islands, where he owns a private isle, as his permanent address in annual sex-offender registrations.)\n\n\u201cFundraising, if any, will take place via personal solicitation by the Members of the Board,\u201d the group\u2019s IRS application stated. \u201cThe initial contribution to the organization will be from the primary donor, Mr. Epstein.\u201d\n\nThe group said it would \u201ccarry out its purpose through the direct funding of celebrations and other planned events, including symposiums, lectures, and galas, both within the United States and abroad planned by third parties and other non-profit organizations and governmental entities,\u201d via \u201cprivate donations from individuals.\u201d\n\nThe disgraced financier\u2019s group, however, didn\u2019t list any revenues until 2015 or any contributions to charities until the 2016 and 2017 tax years.\n\nGratitude America Ltd. donated $150,000 each in 2017 to MIT and the Kuhn Foundation, run by writer Robert Lawrence Kuhn, who hosts a TV program called \u201cCloser to Truth.\u201d (One biography on the Chopra Foundation\u2019s site says Kuhn is \u201can international corporate strategist, investment banker and expert on China\u201d and has \u201ca doctorate in brain research.\u201d)\n\nRather than listing Gratitude America Ltd. as a donor in its own 990 tax form in 2017, Kuhn recorded a $150,000 donation from the \u201cJeffrey Epstein Foundation\u201d in care of \u201cRichard Kahn KBRK Associates 57,\u201d which appears to be a misspelling of Kahn\u2019s business, HBRK. Kahn, who served on Epstein\u2019s previous nonprofit ventures, is the president of Gratitude America, according to tax returns. He runs a corporation called HBRK Associates, Inc., New York state corporation filings show.\n\nEpstein also funded a nonprofit that produces a TV show hosted by the wife of Larry Summers, a Harvard economist and Treasury secretary under former President Clinton.\n\nIn 2016, Gratitude America Ltd. shelled out $110,000 to Verse Video Education. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based nonprofit produces the PBS show Poetry in America, whose creator and host is Harvard professor Elisa New. Verse\u2019s 2016 tax return named New as the group\u2019s president but doesn\u2019t include specific donors for its $1.38 million in total contributions.\n\nNew is married to Summers, Harvard University\u2019s former president, who hobnobbed with Epstein in elite international relations groups and, like Bill Clinton, flew on Epstein\u2019s private jet. Vanity Fair\u2019s 2003 feature mentions Epstein proudly displaying Summers\u2019 letter of commitment to \u201cthe Epstein Program for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary Dynamics\u201d at Harvard. Epstein \u201csays he was reluctant to have his name attached to the program, but Summers persuaded him,\u201d the article said.\n\nSummers came up again during an October 2015 deposition of Alan Dershowitz, who faced a now-settled defamation suit from two attorneys for Epstein\u2019s victims. Dershowitz testified that Epstein\u2019s former assistant, Sarah Kellen, worked \u201cat the Harvard office\u201d where Epstein held meetings with university brass including Summers.\n\nAsked about the women in Epstein\u2019s entourage, Dershowitz said they served coffee or took notes during academic meetings. \u201cAnd these people were seen not only by me. They were seen by Larry Summers, they were seen by [genetics professor George] Church, they were seen by Marvin Minsky, they were seen by some of the most eminent academics and scholars in the world. There was no hint or suggestion of anything sexual or improper in the presence of these people.\u201d\n\nEpstein\u2019s largesse has likewise extended to Harvard\u2019s storied theater troupe. The Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, one of Epstein\u2019s past beneficiaries, received $50,000 from Gratitude America Ltd. in 2016. The Institute includes the Hasty Pudding Club, the country\u2019s oldest social club, and Hasty Pudding Theatricals, the oldest theatrical organization in the U.S., and the Harvard Krokodiloes a capella group.\n\nOn The Hasty Pudding Institute\u2019s website, Epstein\u2019s name tops a roster of 2018 donors called \u201cthe Guardians of the Sphinx\u201d for their donations of $50,000 or more, while Kahn\u2019s business, HBRK Associates, is listed under a \u201csponsors\u201d page for a $50,000-plus donation.\n\nMeanwhile, Gratitude America Ltd. has also supported one of President Trump\u2019s allies for two straight years, a review of tax returns shows.\n\nThe Bruce and Marsha Moskowitz Foundation received $100,000 in 2016 and $50,000 in 2017, Gratitude America Ltd.\u2019s filings state. Bruce Moskowitz, a Palm Beach doctor, was revealed by ProPublica as one of President Trump's Mar-a-Lago cronies secretly influencing policies within the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nBut in its own 990 tax returns, Moskowitz\u2019s nonprofit says it received money from Jeffrey Epstein, not Gratitude America.\n\nMoskowitz\u2014whose name was found in Epstein\u2019s \u201clittle black book\u201d alongside other doctors, under the category \u201cmedical\u201d\u2014listed two donations worth $50,000 in 2016 and 2017 from \u201cJeffrey Epstein/HBRK Assoc., Inc.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Gratitude America Ltd. registered a $100,000 donation in its tax filings for 2017, while Moskowitz recorded a donation for half that amount.\n\nThe Crohn\u2019s Colitis Foundation of America, which Epstein has repeatedly funded since at least 2012, received a total of $20,000 in 2016 and 2017.\n\nEpstein also donated $10,000 in 2016 to the Women Global Cancer Initiative Inc., a nonprofit run by Next modeling agency founder Faith Kates. And he gave $10,000 to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai and $5,000 to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\nIn 2017, Epstein gave $75,000 to the Cancer Research Wellness Institute, a California nonprofit created by a grandson of alternative-cancer treatment doctor Max Gerson, and $25,000 to Nautilus Think, a New York nonprofit that publishes a science magazine. Epstein additionally contributed $50,000 to the University of Arizona Foundation, and the Tucson research university listed Gratitude America Ltd. as a sponsor of its 2017 Science of Consciousness conference inside a book of abstracts.\n\nHe donated more money in 2017, with $15,000 going to \u201cFriends of Elton John,\u201d which appears to be the the Elton John AIDS Foundation, a charity Epstein announced funding for years before.\n\nGratitude America listed a donation of $50,000 to the Chopra Foundation; $60,000 to a group labeled as \u201cAssociation Mind Education\u201d in Rome, Italy; and $50,000 to the United Jewish Appeal (UJA) Federation of New York.\n\nEpstein appears to have provided all of the funding for the International Police & Fire Chaplains Association in 2017 with a $50,000 donation. The group, based in Taylor, Michigan, reported gross receipts of $50,000 or less in 2017, and for the last several years, IRS records show.\n\nThe billionaire has supported a slew of New York nonprofits dedicated to the arts, too.\n\nHe gave $25,000 to the Film Society of Lincoln Center and $50,000 to MET Orchestra Musicians in 2017. He also donated $10,000 to a Brooklyn-based group, the Independent Filmmaker Project (Gratitude America appears to have miscalled them \u201cIndependent Feature Project\u201d in its tax return but used IFP\u2019s same address).\n\nGratitude America said it donated $50,000 to the New York Concert Artists Association in 2016, but the Association denied receiving any funds from Epstein or his foundation.\n\nThis year, Gratitude America Ltd. apparently donated to prominent litigator Stephen Susman\u2019s fundraising page for Bike MS, a cycling event that raises money for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Epstein\u2019s donation of $10,000 was the highest contribution on the website, next to another $10,000 from Susman\u2019s wife, Ellen. (In 2017, Gratitude America noted a $5,000 donation to \u201cWalk MS\u201d in New Jersey that appears to be unrelated to Susman\u2019s payout.)\n\nEpstein and Susman were acquainted as early as 2010, when Epstein was on probation for his Florida sex crimes. Epstein traveled to New York several times to meet Susman, who, according to a letter in Epstein\u2019s probation file, said their meetings were to discuss \u201cpotential claims against D.B. Zwirn,\u201d a hedge fund that collapsed in 2008 and reportedly cost Epstein millions, according to the Palm Beach Post.\n\nThe Daily Beast left messages for all the schools and charities that Epstein\u2019s group listed as beneficiaries. Some representatives said they didn\u2019t know who operated Gratitude America Ltd. Others said they never received any such donations.\n\nIn an email, Howard Straus, president of the Cancer Research Wellness Institute, said his group has \u201cNEVER received a donation of that magnitude from ANYONE.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would know,\u201d Straus continued. \u201cWe are perennially short of funds, and would love to be the recipient of such largesse, but not from sexual predators.\u201d\n\nJennifer Park of New York Concert Artists said her group never received a donation from Gratitude America. \u201cI am sorry but you have completely wrong information,\u201d she said in an email, adding that her nonprofit was perhaps confused with another group.\n\nAfter reviewing Gratitude America\u2019s tax return, Park again stated her group shouldn\u2019t be listed among the foundation\u2019s recipients. \u201cThis is false, and whoever put our organization name must be responsible for any consequences,\u201d Park added. \u201cWe have never received any donation from what you describe.\u201d\n\nLisa Thomas, director of publicity for the Film Society of Lincoln Center, said Gratitude America\u2019s $25,000 donation \u201cwas an anonymous gift for our 44th Chaplin Award Gala,\u201d which honored actor Robert De Niro in May 2017.\n\n\u201cMr. Epstein did not attend the event and has not been a patron of ours before or since,\u201d Thomas said in an email.\n\nEpstein\u2019s $50,000 donation to the University of Arizona\u2019s Center for Consciousness Studies in 2017 \u201cwas a one-time anonymous gift,\u201d said Chris Sigurdson, the university\u2019s vice president for communications.\n\nJohn Steele, the publisher of Nautilus Think, told The Daily Beast he met Epstein in 2017 but he couldn\u2019t recall under what circumstances. Steele said Epstein, who\u2019s supported many scientific causes, liked his magazine.\n\n\u201cHe made a one-time donation and that was the extent of it,\u201d Steele said.\n\nThe Same Players\n\nGratitude America, Ltd. is run by a trio of Epstein operatives who were also involved in his previous nonprofits. Indeed, they were the only officers of the following now-shuttered groups: the C.O.U.Q. Foundation; J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation; and Epstein Interests.\n\nDarren K. Indyke\u2014a longtime Epstein lawyer\u2014is vice president of Gratitude America, per the 2017 tax return. In the years prior, he was treasurer.\n\nIndyke was active in all three of Epstein\u2019s former foundations, as a trustee of Epstein Interests and vice president of both the C.O.U.Q. Foundation (also known as the Florida Science Foundation) and J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation (which went by Enhanced Education).\n\nIt was Indyke whom New York authorities contacted in March 2015 for information on why one of Epstein\u2019s charities, the Virgin Islands-based Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation, should be exempt from state law, Reuters reported. Months later, Indyke was present for the deposition of Dershowitz, and is currently representing Lana Pozhidaeva, the model whose nonprofit Epstein bankrolled in 2017, in a trademark application for her company.\n\nErika Kellerhals, a Virgin Islands tax attorney, is Gratitude America's secretary and treasurer. She was also secretary, treasurer and trustee of the J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, according to a 2015 registration statement filed with the New York State Attorney General\u2019s Charities Bureau.\n\nKellerhals declined to comment when reached by The Daily Beast. Indyke and Kahn, reached by phone before hanging up, did not return further messages.\n\nEpstein was president of Gratitude America, Ltd. from 2012 until 2015, when one of his associates, Richard D. Kahn, assumed the role. That year, Gratitude America, Ltd. recorded revenues for the first time, with a single $10 million donation from a mysterious company called BV70 LLC, according to a review of tax returns.\n\nOnce a licensed CPA and former treasurer of the C.O.U.Q. Foundation, Kahn wasn\u2019t mentioned as a Gratitude America officer until 2015. The 2015 registration statement for Gratitude America lists Richard Kahn as president and Jeffrey Epstein as director.\n\nIn the document, the group said it wouldn\u2019t solicit donations in Florida, New York and the Virgin Islands as initially planned.\n\nThe C.O.U.Q Foundation filed tax returns in New York as early as 1999 and disbanded in 2012, according to records filed with the state Charities Bureau.\n\nEpstein Interests was active from 1992 to 2012, tax returns reveal, while the J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation appears to have been largely inactive. The latter was incorporated in 2000, but The Daily Beast could only find a tax return for 2002, despite the group filing a registration statement in New York for 2015.\n\nSome of Epstein\u2019s groups appeared to shuffle money to each other. In 2008, Epstein Interests noted a $100,000 grant to the C.O.U.Q. Foundation. During the 2009 tax year, C.O.U.Q. listed Epstein\u2019s charity, \u201cEnhanced Education,\u201d as a contributor of $200,000.\n\nAside from participating in Epstein\u2019s charities, the trio of nonprofit operatives also made donations to political candidates backed by Epstein, according to a review of state and federal election records.\n\nOn July 23, 2018, Epstein, Indyke and Kahn each donated $2,700\u2014the federal limit for individual donations\u2014to the primary campaign of Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands. (Kellerhals and partners at her law firm have been frequent donors to Plaskett, records show.)\n\nIn an itemized receipt of one donation, Kahn listed his occupation as \u201cattorney\u201d and the name of his employer as \u201cself.\u201d But according to New York\u2019s Office of Court Administration, the 46-year-old Kahn was never registered as a lawyer in the state.\n\nThe trio of Epstein, Indyke and Kahn also donated to Plaskett on Aug. 4, 2016, each for a total of $5,400 toward her general and primary campaigns. On July 25, 2016, Kellerhals sent Plaskett $2,200 for the primaries and $1,350 for the general election.\n\nOn July 3, 2014, both Kahn and Indyke donated $2,600 to Plaskett's primary campaign, while Kellerhals donated a total of $1,000 in July 2013 and January 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, Indyke, listing his occupation as \u201cattorney,\u201d donated $5,200 to New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Gary King's campaign on June 17, 2014. Six days later, Kahn\u2019s business, HBRK Associates Inc., gave King $5,200.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, businesses connected to Epstein\u2019s St. Thomas, Virgin Islands address donated more than $35,000 to King\u2019s campaign.\n\nJEGE, LLC, which appears to own Epstein\u2019s private jet, donated $5,200 in September 2014, while \u201cJEGE, Inc\u201d donated $5,000 in July 2014. Companies called \u201cFT RealEstate,\u201d \u201cLaurel, Inc.,\u201d and \u201cNautilus, Inc.\u201d each contributed $5,000, and \u201cMaple, Inc.\u201d and \u201cNeptune LLC\u201d gave $5,200 apiece.\n\nKing told the Santa Fe New Mexican he would return the money, saying, \u201cMy campaign has had an ongoing rule that I would not accept any contributions directly from Mr. Epstein and upon further review, we have learned that he has an interest in the companies in question.\u201d\n\nEpstein had also donated to King\u2019s 2006 run for attorney general. At the time, King said he would return a $15,000 donation from Epstein \u201cto avoid any appearance of impropriety,\u201d the Santa Fe New Mexican reported.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met him personally. He knows other members of my family better,\u201d said King, whose father, former Gov. Bruce King, sold Epstein his 10,000-acre Zorro Ranch in Stanley, New Mexico.\n\nBruce King and former Gov. Bill Richardson were listed side by side in Epstein\u2019s little black book, which was snatched by Epstein\u2019s former house manager, Alfredo Rodriguez, who worked for the financier in 2004 and 2005.\n\nThe address book, obtained by Gawker in 2015, contained the names of suspected Epstein victims, as well as boldfaced names including Courtney Love, David Blaine, Alec Baldwin and Donald, Ivana and Ivanka Trump.\n\nRecords show that in 2007, a year after Richardson returned Epstein's money for his gubernatorial run, Kahn and his wife each donated $2,300 to Richardson\u2019s presidential campaign.
