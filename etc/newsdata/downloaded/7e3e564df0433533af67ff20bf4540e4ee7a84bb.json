Penney and U.S. Steel", "language": "en", "text": "Gimme Credit, an independent bond ratings firm, has released a list of high-yield bonds from 10 companies that it says should underperform the broader \u201cjunk\u201d market.\n\nA list of troubled junk-bond issuers can offer a different take for investors who normally only consider stock-price action and quarterly earnings news.\n\nHigh-yield bonds have been hot for obvious reasons \u2014 the world is awash with cash, and with more than $17 trillion in bonds with negative yields to maturity (according to Bloomberg) and interest rates declining significantly in the U.S., junk bonds have gotten much more popular with TMUBMUSD10Y, +2.15% institutional investors desperate for any securities that generate income.\n\nFactSet\n\nThis year through Oct. 24, the Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Index has returned 11.3%; the $10.5 billion SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF JNK, +0.04% has fared a bit better, returning 11.5%.\n\nMeanwhile, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, +2.15% has declined to 1.77% from 2.69% at the end of 2018, as the Federal Reserve reversed its policy and stopped shrinking its balance sheet. More recently, the Fed has lowered the federal-funds rate twice and started purchasing Treasury bills at a pace of $60 billion a month.\n\nRead: These stocks have the highest dividend yields in the hot real-estate sector\n\nThe junk list\n\nGimme Credit listed its \u201cHigh Yield Bottom Ten\u201d in alphabetical order:\n\n\u2022 AK Steel AKS, +3.25% has a 7% senior note that matures in 2027, selling at a significant discount with a current yield-to-maturity of 10.1%. According to Gimme Credit analyst Evan Mann, the company\u2019s outlook for 2020 is \u201ca bit cloudy as further cuts to North American auto production and increased competition could lead fixed price contracts to reset lower.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Cedar Fair L.P. FUN, +1.26% has 5.375% senior notes due in 2027 trading at a premium, with a yield-to-maturity of 3.5%. Gimme Credit analyst Kim Noland called the bonds \u201cexpensively priced.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Extended Stay America STAY, -0.04% \u201cis moving towards an asset-light model for its midprice longer-stay hotel operations, but this translates to fewer assets and lower Ebitda,\u201d according to Noland. The hotel operator\u2019s 5.25% senior notes due in 2025 now yield 3.4%.\n\n\u2022 Frontier Communications FTR, -0.48% suspended its dividend on common shares in February 2018. The company\u2019s 11% senior notes due in 2025 trade so low that their yield-to-maturity is 30%. Gimme Credit analyst Dave Novosel wrote: \u201cWhile free cash flow is still positive, looming debt maturities starting in 2022 are problematic,\u201d adding that debt restructuring negotiations with creditors are \u201csupposedly ongoing.\u201d\n\n\u2022 J.C. Penney\u2019s JCP, -5.66% 5.875% notes due in 2023 currently yield 10.5%. Mann wrote, ominously: \u201cLeverage is at an unsustainable level and must improve more than we forecast for JCP to avoid some form of debt restructuring.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Realogy Holdings RLGY, +1.02% has 4.875% senior notes due in 2025 that yield 5.1%. According to Mann, the company\u2019s plan to reduce its leverage won\u2019t happen until 2021 \u201cwithout a meaningful recovery in the housing market.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Revlon\u2019s REV, +0.89% bonds have \u201cdeclined dramatically as business visibility has decreased; its mass-market retail business has not adjusted to changing consumer preferences,\u201d according to Noland. The company\u2019s 5.75% senior notes due 2021 have a 15.4% yield.\n\n\u2022 Rite Aid RAD, +2.63% has 6.125% senior notes due in 2023 that currently yield 11.3%. Noland expects \u201cbarely break-even free cash flow this year and minimal debt reduction,\u201d and worries about the company\u2019s ability to complete because of its \u201clack of scale.\u201d\n\n\u2022 United States Steel X, +3.86% has 6.25% senior notes due in 2026 that yield 10.5%. Mann expects \u201cfree cash flow shortfalls over the near to medium term\u201d as the company ramps up capital spending \u201clate in the steel market cycle.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Whiting Petroleum\u2019s WLL, +3.10% \u201cforward progress has stalled due to near-term infrastructure constraints and softer oil/gas prices,\u201d according to Mann. The company\u2019s 6.625% senior dues due in 2026 have a yield of 15.3%.\n\nWhat about the stocks?\n\nHere\u2019s how the stocks have performed, with the companies again listed in alphabetical order:\n\nYou can click the tickers for more about each company, including financials and price ratios.\n\nIn case you are looking for bottom-fishing opportunities, here\u2019s a summary of Wall Street analysts\u2019 ratings for the stocks.\n\nCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn\u2019s Deep Dive columns here.", "description": "The list also includes Revlon and Rite Aid.", "authors": ["Philip Van Doorn", "Investing Columnist"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU008_JCP_20_ZG_20191025082501.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
