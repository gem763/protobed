At first, I couldn\u2019t do it. I had no energy. But as the season has gone on, I\u2019ve got used to it.\n\nFrank Lampard has pushed Tammy Abraham hard (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Now we know what he wants in the press, so for us, it\u2019s about giving defenders no time on the ball \u2013 just rushing them.\u2019\n\nLampard puts a huge emphasis on the fitness of his forward players and spoke earlier in the season of Abraham\u2019s ability to press for 90 minutes, challenging him to improve that area of his game.\n\nThe 22-year-old was substituted late in Chelsea\u2019s 2-1 loss to Liverpool in September and his manager questioned the striker afterwards.\n\n\u2018He was struggling a little bit at the end and again I think it\u2019s what happens with Tammy,\u2019 Lampard told Sky Sports after the loss to the Reds.\n\n\u2018I think he\u2019s had a fantastic start to the season, but now the levels are: can you get through games? I\u2019m not saying today, because he had a little bit of knock, but he came off against Wolves after an incredible performance individually, but the thing with young players sometimes is, yeah, can Tammy get through games?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m asking a lot of him, and I thought again he gave his everything as he always does, and he\u2019ll be alright Tammy.\u2019\n\nAbraham\u2019s sensational start to the season has seen him called up to the England squad for the forthcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against Czech Republic and Bulgaria.\n\nThe striker has already won two caps for England but only in friendlies and has been considering committing his international future to Nigeria, however, if he takes to the field in Prague or Sofia then he will be set on a career with the Three Lions.\n\nMORE: Emile Heskey rates Arsenal and Chelsea\u2019s Premier League top four chances\n\nMORE: Juventus manager Maurizio Sarri eyeing January bid for Chelsea full-back Emerson Palmieri", "description": "Tammy Abraham says Frank Lampard upset a lot of Chelsea players when he arrived at the club because he made them do so much running in pre-season training.
