The explosives seriously damaged facilities, though no one was injured.\n\nThe demonstrators also \u201cset fire to Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, broke the roll-up gate and stormed the building to inflict damage,\u201d the Hong Kong government announced in a later statement.\n\nThe government also referred to \u201csome radical protesters\u201d who \u201chave removed railing from roads, spray-painted and vandalized shops,\u201d in the statement, adding that the disruption has stopped traffic.\n\nProtesters who gathered Saturday in Sham Shui Poin, Prince Edward and Mong Kok on Saturday were \u201cparticipating in an unauthorized assembly,\u201d the government said.\n\nThe government said banks were also vandalized and demonstrators were wearing banned masks.\n\n\u201cThe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government strongly condemns the rioters\u2019 acts which breached the public peace and jeopardized public safety, and appeals to members of the public to dissociate themselves from the rioters and work together with government to restore public order,\u201d the statement said.\n\nStill, police didn\u2019t use teargas Saturday making protests less tense at first compared to other weekend demonstrations. Later in the day police fired a shot outside the Mong Kok police station after a small group of protesters cursed and shined a laser at officers beating a couple of men.\n\nLast week Hong Kong banned wearing masks in public in an attempt to quell escalating protests, but the move was followed by violence overnight, bringing the city to a standstill last Saturday, with the subway and businesses shuttered. Opposition leaders warned the ban on masks would only aggravate tensions since protesters use the masks for protection from tear gas.\n\nHong Kong has been gripped by weekend protests since early June against a now-withdrawn extradition bill. The demonstrations have since evolved into a wider pro-democracy movement.", "description": "Oct. 12 (UPI) \u2014 Some protesters in Hong Kong hurled several Molotov cocktails inside a subway station and vandalized property during demonstrations", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
