We have a lot of work to do but we will improve as confidence will grow.\u201d\n\nThe result increased the pressure on Sylvinho, who has been unable to instil life into the team after taking over from Bruno Genesio during the close season.\n\nLyon enjoyed possession but failed to threaten, unable to muster a single shot in the opening half hour as St Etienne stayed compact in defence.\n\nLes Verts had the first clear chance after 20 minutes when Boudebouz\u2019s 10-metre strike forced Anthony Lopes to a superb save.\n\nOL\u2019s Houssem Aouar found the back of the net on the hour, only for referee Clement Turpin to rule the goal out for an offside position after a VAR review.\n\nLyon were the most dangerous side in the second half but keeper Jessy Moulin blocked Moussa Dembele\u2019s header in the 75th minute.\n\nThe visitors, however, finished the game with 10 men after Dubois left he field with a thigh injury.\n\nThe defender is now a doubt for France\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Iceland and Turkey on Oct. 11 and 14, respectively.\n\nLyon could have wrapped it up with three minutes left but Aouar\u2019s chip at the end of a counter attack went just wide and it was St Etienne who delivered the killer blow when Beric\u2019s header ended in the far top corner, sparking wild celebrations in the crowd.\n\nElsewhere, top scorer Victor Osimhen netted his seventh league goal of the season to salvage a 2-2 home draw for Lille against Nimes.", "description": "Second-half substitute Robert Beric struck late to give St Etienne a 1-0 home win against bitter rivals Olympique Lyonnais in Claude Puel's first game in charge with Les Verts on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437834099&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF950P3", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
