Many party members blame the grand coalition, arguing that the compromises the party has been forced to make with Merkel\u2019s center-right bloc has made it impossible for them to fulfil the promises they made to supporters.\n\nMore than 50 percent of the SPD\u2019s 425,000 members participated in the vote, which was carried out online and by postal ballot over the past two weeks.\n\nThe election of Geywitz, a little known SPD official from Brandenburg, and Scholz, who is also Germany\u2019s vice chancellor, is seen as an endorsement of the continuation of the grand coalition, known as the GroKo in Germany.\n\nBut Walter-Borjans, the former finance minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Esken, an MP from southwest Germany, have made no secret of their dislike for partnership with Merkel\u2019s bloc.\n\nWalter-Borjans recently signaled he would only support maintaining the coalition if the conservatives agreed to a \u20ac500 billion investment program to improve Germany\u2019s infrastructure and alleviate \u201csocial inequality.\u201d It\u2019s a demand Merkel and her allies, who insist the country maintain a balanced budget, can\u2019t accept.\n\n\u201cEveryone can see that this coalition is wearing on both parties and is not good for the country,\u201d Borjans said in a recent newspaper interview.\n\nA final decision on the party\u2019s leadership will come at a party convention in early December but delegates are expected to honor the results of the membership poll.", "description": "Opponents of governing coalition make it to second round of center-left leadership contest.", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178316804-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
