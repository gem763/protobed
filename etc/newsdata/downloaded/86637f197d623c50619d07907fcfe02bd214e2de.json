We can't sit here and assume that because America is today the leader that it will always get to be the leader if we don't innovate. Libra will be backed mostly by dollars and I believe it will extend America\u2019s financial leadership as well as our democratic values and oversight around the world. If America doesn\u2019t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.\u201d\n\nIn his questions to Zuckerberg, Representative Patrick McHenry asked about China and the rapid rise of its technology companies. Zuckerberg said, \u201cToday, six out of 10 of the top tech companies are coming out of China and certainly don\u2019t share our values.\u201d\n\nRep. Andy Barr also discussed the potential threat of China\u2019s digital renminbi and its involvement in the Belt and Road project, an initiative that launched six years ago and is a global development strategy adopted by the Chinese government involving infrastructure development and investments across the globe.\n\nSpeaking to the press following the event, Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters said regarding China:\n\n\u201cI believe that we are big enough, we are strong enough and we are smart enough to meet the needs and to be competitive in the world, we just have to keep going.\u201d\n\nFinancial analysts are also concerned about a Chinese digital currency\n\nRBC Capital Markets analysts previously stated that stifling Facebook\u2019s Libra may leave the field open to China\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC) to dominate the financial world. A concern that plays into the argument that Libra is the best and perhaps the only tool the U.S. has against that scenario.\n\nRBC claimed at the time that if U.S. regulators were to dismiss Libra and decide not to draft a set of regulations to encourage crypto innovation in the U.S., China's CBDC could become the global digital currency in emerging economies.\n\nFacebook could leave Libra\n\nCointelegraph just reported that Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg stated that Libra\u2019s primary member, being Facebook itself, could withdraw from the Libra Association should it launch without approval from regulators in the United States.", "description": "During the Congressional hearing on Oct. 23, Mark Zuckerberg touched upon the potential threat of China\u2019s digital currency", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8xMjRmYWNlYzIxZjg1OTYyNDNlODZkNjIxNDEyYzQyMy5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
