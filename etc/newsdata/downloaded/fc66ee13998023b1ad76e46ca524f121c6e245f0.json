Just wanted to have a quick chat with you about your recent order with us to go through the sofas and discuss the delivery.\n\n\"If you could give us a call back between now and 6pm, I'm here. Just ask for Maxine. Thank you.\"\n\nSeconds after this, she begins singing the chorus to Sheeran's 2017 hit, Shape of You, crooning down the phone: \"I'm in love with the shape of you.\"\n\nAlongside the recording, Mark wrote: \"Shoutout to Maxine from Oak Furniture Land who's in love with the shape of me.\"\n\nMore than 39,000 people liked his post and over 5,000 retweeted it.\n\nMany also took the time to comment and share their amusement and love for Maxine - whoever she may be.\n\nOne person said: \"I'm howling.\"\n\nAnother commented: \"HAHAHA this is brill.\"\n\nA third added: \"Bless her.\"\n\nSomeone else replied: \"Love it. She's a keeper.\"\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nSo did Mark speak to Maxine again after the message was received?\n\nSpeaking to MirrorOnline, he said: \"I returned the call but as Maxine was on another call, I dealt with her collegaue.\n\n\"I was looking forward to letting her know how she had made my day.\n\n\"I posted it on Twitter in the hope that it would cheer a few followers up, had no idea it would blow up the way that it did.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm glad the response though is of people finding it really funny. So many people are quoting the tweet saying they love Maxine and that she's a legend etc and I can't agree more.\n\n\"There should be more people like Maxine in the world.\"", "description": "The internet is obsessed with Maxine from Oak Furnitureland who left a hilarious voicemail on a customer's phone", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20724834.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_251019SLUG_7177JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
