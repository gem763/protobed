What is usually a solemn, formal prorogation ceremony erupted into raucous scenes as opposition lawmakers in the House of Commons chamber shouted \u201cShame on you\u201d and held up signs reading \u201cSilenced.\u201d\n\nCommons Speaker John Bercow expressed his displeasure at Parliament\u2019s suspension, saying \u201cthis is not a standard or normal prorogation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the longest for decades and it represents an act of executive fiat,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prime minister has had a turbulent week since Parliament returned from its summer break on Sept. 3. He kicked 21 lawmakers out of the Conservative group in Parliament after they sided with the opposition, and saw two ministers quit his government \u2013 one of them his own brother.\n\nParliament\u2019s suspension ended a day of blows to the embattled Johnson. First an opposition-backed measure designed to stop Britain from crashing out of the EU on Oct. 31 without a divorce deal became law after receiving the formal assent of Queen Elizabeth II. The law compels the government to ask the EU for a three-month delay if no deal has been agreed by Oct. 19.\n\nJohnson says the country\u2019s delayed exit must happen at the end of October, with or without a divorce agreement to smooth the way. But many lawmakers fear a no-deal Brexit would be economically devastating, and are determined to stop him.\n\n\u201cI will not ask for another delay,\u201d Johnson said. But he has few easy ways out of it. His options \u2013 all of them extreme \u2013 include disobeying the law, which could land him in court or even prison, and resigning so that someone else would have to ask for a delay.\n\nLegislators also demanded the government release, by Wednesday, emails and text messages among aides and officials relating to suspending Parliament and planning for Brexit amid allegations that the suspension is being used to circumvent democracy.\n\nUnder parliamentary rules, the government is obliged to release the documents.\n\nIn a statement, the government said it would \u201cconsider the implications of this vote and respond in due course.\u201d\n\nThen, early Tuesday, lawmakers rebuffed, for a second time, Johnson\u2019s request for an early election, which he said was \u201cthe only way to break the deadlock in the House.\u201d\n\nOpposition parties voted against the measure or abstained, denying Johnson the two-thirds majority he needed. They want to make sure a no-deal departure is blocked before agreeing to an election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re eager for an election, but as keen as we are we, we are not prepared to inflict the disaster of a no deal on our communities, our jobs, our services, or indeed our rights,\u201d Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said.\n\nJohnson acknowledged Monday that a no-deal Brexit \u201cwould be a failure of statecraft\u201d for which he would be partially to blame.\n\nOn a visit to Dublin, Johnson said he would \u201coverwhelmingly prefer to find an agreement\u201d and believed a deal could be struck by Oct. 18, when leaders of all 28 EU countries hold a summit in Brussels.\n\nThe comments marked a change of tone, if not substance, for Johnson, who is accused by opponents of driving Britain at full-tilt toward a cliff-edge Brexit.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned Johnson that \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as a clean break,\u201d and if Britain crashed out, it would \u201ccause severe disruption for British and Irish people alike.\u201d\n\nJohnson and Varadkar said they had \u201ca positive and constructive meeting,\u201d but there was no breakthrough on the issue of the Irish border, the main stumbling block to a Brexit deal.\n\nThe EU says Britain has not produced any concrete proposals for replacing the contentious \u201cbackstop,\u201d a provision in the withdrawal agreement reached by Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May that is designed to ensure an open border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland.\n\nAn open border is crucial to the regional economy and underpins the peace process that ended decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nOpposition to the backstop was a key reason Britain\u2019s Parliament rejected May\u2019s Brexit deal with the EU three times earlier this year. British Brexit supporters oppose the backstop because it locks Britain into EU trade rules to avoid customs checks, something they say will stop the U.K. from striking new trade deals with countries such as the United States.\n\nVaradkar said he was open to any alternatives that were \u201clegally workable,\u201d but none had been received so far.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of agreed alternative arrangements, no backstop is no deal for us,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Bercow, whose control of business in the House of Commons has made him a central player in the Brexit drama, announced he would step down after a decade in the job.\n\nThe colorful speaker, famous for his loud ties and even louder cries of \u201cOrder!\u201d during raucous debates, told lawmakers he will quit the same day Britain is due to leave the EU, Oct. 31.\n\nThroughout the three years since Britain voted to leave the EU, Bercow has angered the Conservative government by repeatedly allowing lawmakers to seize control of Parliament\u2019s agenda to steer the course of Brexit.\n\nHe said he was simply fulfilling his role of being the \u201cbackbenchers\u2019 backstop\u201d and letting Parliament have its say.\n\n\u201cThroughout my time as speaker, I have sought to increase the relative authority of this legislature, for which I will make absolutely no apology,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The British government has formally suspended Parliament, sending lawmakers home for five weeks amid a Brexit crisis.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/Britain_Brexit_86468.jpg-72514_c0-165-5371-3296_s1770x1032.jpg?4ac50a8d49ccba892a65c8937fe4eb62073c973e", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
