USA TODAY\n\nPenn State running back C.J. Holmes posted a letter from a fan addressed to teammate Jonathan Sutherland on Twitter on Monday that asked Sutherland to cut his dreadlocks and clean up his appearance.\n\n\"Watching the Idaho game on TV we couldn't help but notice your \u2014 well \u2014 awful hair,\" reads the letter signed by 1966 alum Dave Petersen who called himself a Penn State alumni. \"Surely there must be mirrors in the locker room! Don't you have parents or girlfriend who've told you those shoulder length dreadlocks look disgusting and are certainly not attractive.\"\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Nittany Lions head coach James Franklin delivered a passionate rebuke of the letter and defended Sutherland, a junior safety from Ottawa, Canada.\n\nmy teammate got this in the mail today, and tbh Im at a lost for words.. I also have locs, Tats, and NFL dreams too, these messages can not be tolerated, this was extremely inappropriate, racially biased, and selfish to feel like you even have a right to send this message #WeArepic.twitter.com/DPTp9Km9yt \u2014 \u3164\uf8ff (@CjHo1mes) October 7, 2019\n\n\"The football that I know and love brings people together and embraces differences \u2014 black, white, brown, Catholic, Jewish or Muslim, rich or poor, rural or urban, Republican or Democrat. Long hair, short hair, no hair, they're all in that locker room together,\" Franklin said. \"Teams all over this country are the purest form of humanity that we have. We don't judge, we embrace differences. We live. We learn. We grow. We support and we defend each other. We're a family.\n\n\"Jonathan Sutherland is one of the most respected players in our program. He's the ultimate example of what our program is all about. He's a captain, he's a Dean List honor student. He's articulate. He's confident. He's intelligent. He's thoughtful. He's caring, and he's committed. He's got two of the most supportive parents and I would be so blessed if my daughters would marry someone like him with his character and integrity one day.\"\n\nJames Franklin with an important and emotional message regarding a fan\u2019s racist letter sent to PSU safety Jonathan Sutherland. pic.twitter.com/z2TFlWKs3m \u2014 Audrey Snyder (@audsnyder4) October 8, 2019\n\nThe Johnstown (Pennsylvania) Tribune-Democrat tracked down Petersen, who said he is a 1966 Penn State graduate. Petersen maintained he did not want to make a racial or cultural statement.\n\n\"I would just like to see the coaches get the guys cleaned up and not looking like Florida State and Miami guys,\" he said.\n\nSutherland has 15 tackles this season (seven solo) and blocked two punts against Idaho during the season opener. He released a Twitter statement Tuesday saying, \"although the message was indeed rude, ignorant, and judging, I've taken no personal offense to it because personally, I must respect (him) as a person before I respect your opinion.\"", "description": "Penn State safety Jonathan Sutherland received a letter asking him to cut his dreadlocks.
