All in six months.\n\nDid I miss anything?\n\nThere's no question that Brown is one of the best receivers in the league when he's on the field, but the distraction became too much to bear for the Raiders, and they cut bait. It's not as if they didn't give Brown plenty of chances. It became obvious that the circus would continue throughout the season, and based on another one of Brown's tweets Saturday morning, it's fair to wonder if a rift would have developed with quarterback Derek Carr.\n\nStory continues\n\nBumper Carrs \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 7, 2019\n\nNote the spelling (and plurality). Now, it appears Brown's tweet was in reference to comments made by Derek's brother, David, on NFL Network after word of the release, in which the elder Carr communicated that his brother was ready to move on.\n\n\"The word that he used, and the word that kind of made the point to me, is relief,\" David Carr said. \"And not that he's happy to see Antonio go ... but there's also a relief, like a huge sigh of relief. That, 'OK, now that drama is kind of behind us. We can move forward with the focus of our football team.' \"\n\n[RELATED: Why AB-Raiders divorce leaves no winners, only questions]\n\nThe drama might be behind the Raiders, and now they can move forward without the never-ending distraction, no matter how talented Brown might be. But if you think this is the last we've heard from Brown on the subject, clearly you haven't been paying attention.\n\nAntonio Brown calls out Raiders' Derek Carr, brother David on Twitter originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "Had the Raiders not cut bait with Antonio Brown on Saturday, it's fair to wonder if a rift would have developed with Derek Carr.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Zj3liYs2EAQqgkabtZ_2jg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RC9ONw2cWoX82mR78jugJA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/eeeff2cd2175a209f9f4a4ee3919de30", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
