The withdrawals were first reported by the Financial Times and Bloomberg.\n\nA Visa spokesperson told The Verge. \u201cVisa has decided not to join the Libra Association at this time,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe will continue to evaluate and our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association\u2019s ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations.\u201d\n\nThe withdrawals leave Libra with no major US payment processor, a serious issue for the fledgling project. They also come just one week after PayPal (eBay\u2019s former subsidiary) withdrew from the association.\n\nThe first official meeting of the Libra Council is in just three days, scheduled for October 14th in Geneva. That meeting will likely result in more specific commitments from all the members involved, which may have inspired some of the recent defections. Still, the departures leave the project in a precarious place as Libra hopes to move beyond initial criticisms of the project.\n\n\u201cWe highly respect the vision of the Libra Association\u201d\n\n\u201cWe highly respect the vision of the Libra Association,\u201d eBay said in a statement. \u201cHowever, eBay has made the decision to not move forward as a founding member. At this time, we are focused on rolling out eBay\u2019s managed payments experience for our customers.\u201d\n\nStripe gave a similar explanation for its withdrawal. \u201cStripe is supportive of projects that aim to make online commerce more accessible for people around the world,\u201d the company said. \u201cLibra has this potential. We will follow its progress closely and remain open to working with the Libra Association at a later stage.\u201d Mastercard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn response, Libra Association policy chief Dante Disparte thanked the companies for their ongoing support of the organization\u2019s mission.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on moving forward and continuing to build a strong association of some of the world\u2019s leading enterprises, social impact organizations and other stakeholders,\u201d Disparte said. \u201cWe look forward to the inaugural Libra Association Council meeting in just 3 days and announcing the initial members of the Libra Association.\u201d\n\nThe remaining Libra members are facing growing pressure from governments and regulators, many of whom see the project as a threat to the existing financial system. On Wednesday, two Democratic senators urged Visa, Mastercard, and Stripe to reconsider their involvement with Libra, saying it could have significant regulatory consequences for any payment processor involved.\n\n\u201cIf you take this on,\u201d the letters read, \u201cyou can expect a high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra-related activities, but on all payment activities.\u201d\n\nIn response to the news, Libra chief David Marcus, a former president of former Libra Association, PayPal, conceded the news was not \u201cgreat in the short term,\u201d but \u201cliberating\u201d to \u201cknow that you\u2019re on to something when so much pressure builds up.\u201d Marcus also casts the news of Mastercard and Visa\u2019s withdrawal from the project as the two payment giants simply waiting until there\u2019s proper \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d on Libra.\n\nI would caution against reading the fate of Libra into this update. Of course, it\u2019s not great news in the short term, but in a way it\u2019s liberating. Stay tuned for more very soon. Change of this magnitude is hard. You know you\u2019re on to something when so much pressure builds up. \u2014 David Marcus (@davidmarcus) October 11, 2019\n\nUpdate, October 11, 4:14PM ET: Updated with comment from the Libra Association.\n\nUpdate, October 11, 4:34PM ET: Updated with comment from Visa.\n\nUpdate, October 11, 5:13PM ET: Updated with news that Mercado Pago is also leaving the association.\n\nUpdate, October 11, 6:20PM ET: Updated with comment from Libra chief David Marcus.", "description": "Mastercard, Visa, eBay, Stripe and Mercado Pago have all withdrawn from the Libra Association, dealing a major blow to Facebook\u2019s plans for a distributed, global cryptocurrency. \"eBay has made the decision to not move forward as a founding member,\" the company said in a statement.", "authors": ["Russell Brandom", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yuDBII8tpczgtZPvToli-BuZJ-E=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16677181/VRG_ILLO_3512_001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
