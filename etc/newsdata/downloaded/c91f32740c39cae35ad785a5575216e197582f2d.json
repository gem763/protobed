It will include some mechanized forces,\u201d Esper said at a press conference at NATO Headquarters in Brussels when asked about the new stay-behind force Trump authorized this week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the details, but the mission in Syria remains what the mission in Syria began with. It\u2019s always been about defeating \u2026 ISIS,\u201d Esper said. \u201cThat is the core mission.\u201d\n\nTrump made no mention this morning of the troops that were staying behind.\n\n\"Our soldiers have left and are leaving Syria for other places, then ... COMING HOME!\" he wrote.\n\nSome reports have said the U.S. is deploying tanks. But the military typically refers to units equipped with Bradley fighting vehicles as mechanized forces, and to units with Abrams tanks as armored forces. It wasn\u2019t clear from Esper\u2019s remarks how many troops would stay at the oil fields or what types of vehicles will be sent in, but an Army brigade in Kuwait is outfitted with both Bradleys and tanks.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that as many as 500 troops could be staying in Syria.\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s original pullout order, most of the 1,000 U.S. forces in Syria were to leave, with a small force to remain at the southern garrison in At-Tanf. The oil field mission represents a partial reversal of that move. The Trump administration\u2019s special representative for Syria, James Jeffrey, suggested this week that the military also plans to keep open an airfield in the country\u2019s northeast as a logistics hub.\n\nEsper this week said the U.S. forces leaving Syria would head into western Iraq. But after Iraqi leaders said those troops can't stay there, Esper said they will be deployed in Iraq only temporarily before coming home.\n\nThe defense chief also said today that Kurdish troops are recapturing ISIS members who escaped from Kurdish-run prisons in the northeast since the start of Turkey\u2019s incursion into Syria.\n\n\u201cThe SDF has assured us that all ISIS prisoners are being secured,\u201d he said, referring to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.", "description": "Trump authorized new stay-behind force this week.", "authors": ["Wesley Morgan"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-937029410-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
