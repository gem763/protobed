How many East Germans wanted the revolution? How many were tired of being \u201cEast Germans,\u201d and actively sought unity with the West? Was Mr. Gauck wrong when he said that East Germans \u201coverwhelmed\u201d their oppressors? Or were they passive participants who were themselves overwhelmed, only to see the pain of their sudden dislocation written out of history?\n\nThe same thing happened during the migration crisis: Eastern Germans again felt that history was being decided without anybody asking their opinion. This time, they\u2019ve had enough, as three decades of buried rage and fear have surfaced in a toxic, xenophobic nationalism.\n\nThis narrative, too, is probably incomplete. It has nevertheless gained traction, not least because the AfD is exploiting it. The party has called on voters to \u201ccomplete the revolution,\u201d evoking the feeling that whatever injustices East Germans had to suffer since 1989 could be redeemed in a populist uprising. The most popular chant from the 1989 demonstrations \u2014 \u201cWir sind das Volk,\u201d or \u201cWe are the people\u201d has become as a right-wing slogan, too.", "description": "", "authors": ["Anna Sauerbrey", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Germany-Reunification-Far-Right.Html Smid Nytcore-Ios-Share"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
