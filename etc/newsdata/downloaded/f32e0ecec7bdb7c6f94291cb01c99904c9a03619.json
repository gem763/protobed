At the same time, they could face the wrath of moderate swing voters who are far less supportive of the president.\n\nOf course, there is no prospect of a secret ballot. That means moderate Republican senators, such as Susan Collins of Maine, face a politically brutal choice as they run for reelection.\n\n\u201cThese Senate Republicans \u2026 are going to be pinned down to a yes/no answer\u201d\n\n\u201cThese Senate Republicans, should the Democrats vote impeachment, which is far more likely than not, are going to be pinned down to a yes/no answer,\u201d said Murphy. In the past Murphy has been a fierce critic of the president.\n\n\u201cIf they provide cover to Donald Trump for this, a clear violation of his role as president, we\u2019re going to lose in Colorado with Cory Gardner. We\u2019re going to lose Maine with Susan Collins. We\u2019re going to lose Arizona with Martha McSally. And the Democrats will put the Senate very much in play.\u201d\n\nMany Republican lawmakers in both chambers stoutly defended Trump during special prosecutor Rober Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But this week has seen a number of Republicans express concern about the president\u2019s behavior in the dealings with Ukraine.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who also faces an election in his home state of Kentucky next year, has been critical of the House decision to move forward on impeachment. But he shocked some observers when he agreed to a demand by Democratic leader Sen. Charles Shumer of New York to call for the release of a still-anonymous whistleblower report detailing an intelligence officials concerns about Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\nPrivately, Senate Republicans are much less sold on opposing impeachment\n\nDespite McConnell\u2019s current stance against impeachment, Murphy said Senate Republicans are privately much less sold on opposing the impeachment effort.\n\n\u201cOne Republican senator told me if it was a secret vote, 30 Republican senators would vote to impeach Trump,\u201d he claimed.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi this week announced that the House would pursue impeachment after the revelation that Trump implied he wanted cooperation from Ukrainian officials in investigating Biden for his role in supporting the removal of a prosecutor would be tied to the release of a $400 million dollar aid package during a phone call with the new president of Ukraine in July.\n\nThe House appears to have enough votes to impeach Trump. In the Senate, however, his actual removal from office would require 67 votes, or support from at least 20 Republican Senators, assuming all 47 Democrats vote to remove.", "description": "Business Insider - Privately, Senate Republicans are much less sold on supporting the president\u00a0than they're willing to say in public, one longtime GOP strategist says..
