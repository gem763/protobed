If given executive power, some progressives may use it to cancel any culture or faith other than their own.\n\nAnd yet \u2026.\n\nAnd yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. You\u2019re either part of removing that corruption or you are not. When your nation\u2019s political system is in danger, staying home and not voting is not a responsible option.\n\nPolitics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed. Trump represents a much more important and fundamental threat \u2014 to the norms, values, standards and soul of this country.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Brooks", "Nytimes.Com Opinion"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
