Are you kidding me? I\u2019d do it again for half the money,\u2019 Orlando insisted.\n\nOrlando starred as Legolas in the trilogy (Picture: Warner Brothers)\n\n\u2018I think there was a little bump when the movies came out\u2026 It was like a little bump, but it was nice.\u2019\n\nNevertheless, the star pretty much ruled out being in the series which is set to take to Amazon.\n\nHe told Entertainment Tonight: \u2018Look, I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to approach it. I haven\u2019t had any conversations about that.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know where I would fit in now in that world. If I think you\u2019re saying [I\u2019d come back] as Legolas, they probably got a 19-year-old kid,\u2019 he later added.\n\nCan\u2019t have it all, eh?\n\nGot a showbiz story?
