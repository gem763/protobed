Between them, the stalls - selling everything from crab soup to Vietnamese Banh My sandwiches - accept payment from most of Vietnam\u2019s 28 different e-wallets, which also allow users to make cash transfers through their mobile phones.\n\nMobile e-payment logos are seen at a street food stall in Ho Chi Minh city in Vietnam, October 15, 2019. REUTERS/Yen Duong\n\nThe wallets, which hope to take advantage of Vietnam\u2019s plan to become a cashless economy by 2027, compete fiercely to gain many users to help them to turn a profit, a battle for market share replicated across Southeast Asia.\n\nNot all of them will survive. Already, the region\u2019s crowded mobile payments sector is starting to shrink, with each national market expected to support only two mass e-wallets, according to consultancy Oliver Wyman.\n\n\u201cThe e-wallets spend a lot of money on attracting customers and retaining them, getting them to use the wallet in their daily life,\u201d said Duncan Woods, head of Oliver Wyman\u2019s Asia Pacific retail and business banking practice.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got so many of them out there, it\u2019s about who\u2019s got the deepest pockets,\u201d he said.\n\nSoutheast Asia has at least 150 e-wallet licence holders, and firms including Grab, Go-Jek, Tencent Holdings (0700.HK), Ant Financial, Singapore Telecom (STEL.SI), AirAsia (AIRA.KL) and dozens of fintech firms are fighting for dominance.\n\nMany have the cash. Grab plans to invest $500 million (389.7 million pounds) in its Vietnam business, with payments a focus area. Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund and GIC invested $300 million in e-wallet VNPAY\u2019s parent company in July, and e-wallet Momo raised $100 million from Warburg Pincus in January, according to news publication DealStreetAsia.\n\nSome are using the cash to build scale, others to buy it, as they race to secure a dominant position in a mobile payments market estimated by Nomura to grow seven-fold to $109 billion by 2025.\n\nMERGER MANIA\n\nSoftbank-backed Grab is in talks to merge its Indonesian digital payments firm, OVO, and Ant Financial-backed Dana, both of which are among Indonesia\u2019s top five e-wallets, to bulk up and power ahead of rival Gojek, sources said. In Vietnam, e-wallet Vimo merged with payment processor mPOS and rebranded as NextPay in June - and kicked off a $30 million fundraising round and an ambitious growth plan.\n\n\u201cWe expect to be present across Vietnam and win 50% of the market with 300,000 acceptance points by 2023 from 60,000 merchants now,\u201d NextPay\u2019s CEO Nguyen Huu Tuat said, while noting that getting customers to change their habits was a challenge.\n\nStreet sellers in Ho Chi Minh City echoed this view, despite government efforts to change behaviour.\n\nSome wallets, including the partnership between local firm Moca and Grab, offer buyers discounts of up to 30% if they use their wallet, stallholders said.\n\n\u201cI want to comply with the government\u2019s cashless plan although I\u2019m not very fond of it, so I offer \u2018morning cash, afternoon card\u2019\u201d one merchant, Huong, said when Reuters visited her noodle stall.\n\nDIFFERENT STRATEGIES Attracting users is essential as a tipping point looms.\n\n\u201cE-wallet consolidation at a regional and local level is highly likely as products mature and consumers migrate to those who offer the most services,\u201d said Phil Pomford, an APAC general manager at fintech firm FIS.\n\n\u201cOne likely play would involve one of the big global and/or regional super apps consolidating services across South East Asia.\u201d\n\nThe region\u2019s largest players, including ride hailing-turned super apps Grab and Go-Jek, are betting that becoming the main payment method will bind consumers into their networks and offer them higher margin services \u2014 a model that Alibaba and Tencent pioneered in China.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons our payments business has seen such success is because we\u2019ve had a very intentional strategy of developing the largest merchant network, whether it\u2019s offline, it\u2019s online or whether it\u2019s on-demand,\u201d Grab\u2019s president, Ming Maa told Reuters.\n\nOthers have looked to use an e-wallet as an add-on to their existing businesses. Users of AirAsia\u2019s BigPay wallet can earn AirAsia travel rewards by using the wallet, which they also hope can become a mainstream payment method.\n\nTencent and Alibaba and its affiliates have primarily focused on Chinese tourists using their wallets in Southeast Asia and have also each invested in wallets in almost every market in the region.\n\nGrab says it is the only digital payments provider in Southeast Asia with access to e-money licences in six major economies, making it the furthest on with a regional approach.\n\nSome observers are still sceptical however.\n\n\u201cMany e-wallets\u2019 business model seems to be: 1) gain a lot of customers and their data. 2) question mark. 3) be very profitable,\u201d said Dmitry Levit a partner at VC firm Cento, which has invested into several payment-processing companies, but stayed away from wallets.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nGo-Jek is not worried about competition from other wallets or incumbents, said Aldi Haryopratomo, CEO of Go-Pay, the company\u2019s payment platform.\n\n\u201cBy being the payments provider that connects the driver to the bank, we are able to make sufficient margin. And if you always think about competition and threat from the banks, then you are thinking that the pie is fixed,\u201d said Haryopratomo.\n\n\u201cBut in Indonesia, the pie is actually getting bigger.\u201d", "description": "Just next to Ho Chi Minh City's financial district, two dozen street vendors' stalls display colourful adverts for e-wallets backed by private equity firm Warburg Pincus, ride-hailing firm Grab and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, among others.
