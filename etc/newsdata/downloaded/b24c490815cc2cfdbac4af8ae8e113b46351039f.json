The group later apologised over the violence, and scaled down a planned 'shutdown' of Gatwick Airport, but still continued their disruption this morning.\n\nResponses from many of Twitter showed that public sympathy with the group has run dry. Many Londoners branded today's action 'pointless' and counter-productive.\n\nAbby Deveney wrote: 'Blocking Oxford Circus halts buses used by real people ... people with buggies, people with walking sticks, people with invisible mobility issues, yeah, those kind of people. This strategy is not helpful'\n\nAnother Twitter user wrote: 'The extinction rebellion lot made me late to work. They really blocked Oxford Street (where regular cars are already banned) and just disrupted public transport. They need to work on their tactics.'\n\nExtinction Rebellion took over Oxford Street today as their fortnight of stunts ground on, testing Londoners' patience\n\nActivists built a wooden structure at the junction of Oxford Street and Regent's Street, forced police to move in en masse\n\nPolice quickly shut down the area as they move to dismantle the structure without hurting those tied to it\n\nThe group, whose cause suffered a setback when an activists resorted to violence yesterday, admitted they were low on numbers\n\nRobert Hook wrote: 'A fairly pointless protest indeed, given that the desire of most vendors along Oxford Street is to pedestrianise it!\n\n'It's true that this is one of the most polluted streets on the planet, but the only people inconvenienced by this are the people least able to make a difference!'\n\nBus routes 7, 12, 22, 55, 73, 88, 94, 98, 113, 159, 390 and 453 were all affected, Transport for London said.\n\nLater today, the group are planning to vandalise Whitehall buildings with red chalk as it tours government departments handing in 'demands' put together by its leadership.\n\nOne protester sits on top of a pyramid structure at the junction of Oxford Circus and Regent Street\n\nThere were only a handful of Extinction Rebellion protestors demonstrating today, blocking off one of the capital's busiest junctions\n\nThe pyramid structure has been erected in the middle of the junction. One man is sitting on top of it, forcing buses to be re-routed\n\nThe group, which launched its latest campaign 10 days ago, says it will use washable chalk spray to mark the path of its march from Whitehall Gardens to six government departments on Friday.\n\nYesterday, Extinction Rebellion was forced to apologise after activists targeted a tube train at Canning Town.\n\nOne activist was dragged to the ground from the roof of the train by an irate commuter. Video then showed the activist apparently kicking out at the person who had pulled him to the floor.\n\nThe group later said: 'It is regretful that there was violence at today's action at Canning Town tube station. We would like to express our sadness that events escalated this way.\n\nResponses from workers on Twitter showed that sympathy among the public is running thin after two weeks of mayhem\n\n'We are aware that one of our activists responded in self-defence in a moment of panic when confronted by a threatening situation.\n\n'He acknowledges his accountability for this action and we offer gratitude for members of the public who helped to protect him.'\n\nThe group apologised for the disruption caused to commuters, but said the incident should not create 'unnecessary division'.\n\nPolice charge five Extinction Rebellion activists including Buddhist teacher, 36, and 83-year-old grandfather after protesters caused chaos by climbing onto and gluing themselves to trains Five people have been charged over yesterday's Tube protests by Extinction Rebellion activists. The three men and two women, arrested in connection with the protests at Canning Town and Shadwell stations, will appear in court today. A further three men arrested at either Canning Town or Stratford have been bailed 'under strict conditions', British Transport Police said. Yesterday as Extinction Rebellion's eco-protest entered its 11th day activists launched a co-ordinated strike on three London Underground stations, clambering on top of carriages and gluing themselves to doors despite Monday's city-wide ban issued by the Met Police. But their efforts to disrupt public transport were met with a furious backlash from commuters, industry groups and politicians leading one XR spokesman to admit the move had been a 'huge own goal'. Video surfaced from Canning Town station of a protester seemingly being beaten and kicked by angry workers on the station platform having been dragged bodily from the top of a train. British Transport Police said today that four people will appear at court this morning charged in connection to the incident at Shadwell DLR station. They are: Margreit Bos, 32 of Chartham, Kent; Martin Newell, 52 of Birmingham; Philip Kingston, 83 of Patchway; and Sue Parfitt, 77 of Bristol. Buddhist trainee teacher Mark Ovland (left in left picture, and right) has been charged after scrambling atop a tube at Canning Town yesterday They have each been charged with obstructing an engine or carriage on the railway contrary to Section 36 of the Malicious Damage Act and will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates\u2019 Court this morning. One of the men arrested at Canning Town will also appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates corner today. Mark Ovland, 36 of Keinton Mandeville, was charged with breaching bail conditions. A second man, aged 35 and from Filton, South Gloucestershire was arrested on suspicion of obstructing the railway and has been bailed with strict conditions, pending further enquiries. The police added that 'enquiries continue in relation to the obstruction incident'. At Stratford two men aged 32 from Lewisham and Hull were arrested for obstructing the railway. They have been bailed with strict conditions, while further enquiries continue.", "description": "The eco-activists have set up a\u00a0wooden pyramid at the junction of Oxford Street and Regent's Street, but it was a shadow of the hundreds who occupied the street in April.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/10/19877080-0-image-a-33_1571391493540.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
