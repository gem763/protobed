But, with Democrats back in control of the House, it\u2019s a priority of many liberals, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. More than half of the House now supports awarding Washington statehood. The House Oversight Committee recently convened a hearing to explore the possibility of creating a new state for the first time in 60 years.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the name.\n\nEvery state gets two statues inside the U.S. Capitol. But, since it\u2019s not a state, the District of Columbia gets only one \u2013 and that honor came just a few years ago. A statue of abolitionist Frederick Douglass - who lived in Washington \u2013 greets tourists in the U.S. Capitol Visitor\u2019s Center. And, if D.C. ever becomes a state, the plan is to name it after Douglass. Think \u201cWDC,\u201d just as you would now. The city would become \u201cWashington Douglass Commonwealth.\u201d\n\nMany liberals support statehood for D.C. \u2013 especially members of \u201cthe Squad,\u201d who often focus on what they see as political injustices.\n\nAn image campaign is already underway. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said last week at a hearing that she\u2019ll fly an American flag bearing 51 stars outside her Capitol Hill office.\n\n\u201cTo deny the statehood of the District of Columbia is to deny the impact of slavery in America,\u201d said Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., at the hearing.\n\nWhat Ocasio-Cortez referenced was the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act. Congress approved a measure and President Abraham Lincoln signed into law a plan to emancipate slaves in Washington on April 16, 1862. This was a few months before Lincoln crafted the Emancipation Proclamation. Many slaves came to Washington to escape slavery.\n\nBut, most Republicans have opposed making D.C. a state.\n\n\u201cCongress cannot admit D.C. legislatively,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. \u201cIf you want to change it, its remedy means amending the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nJordan said the geographic dimensions of the District of Columbia were spelled out in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. It specifically outlined a federal district \u201cnot exceeding ten Miles square\u201d to serve as \u201cthe Seat of Government of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe founders cut up the District of Columbia from parts of Maryland and Virginia, the Potomac River snaking through the middle. Over time, people flocked to the District of Columbia. One part was even known as \u201cWashington City.\u201d\n\nTLAIB VOWS TO DISPLAY ALTERED AMERICAN FLAG WITH 51 STARS IN SUPPORT OF DC STATEHOOD\n\nIt was thought that the hamlets of Georgetown and Alexandria, Va., would function as independent communities inside the District of Columbia. Alexandria prospered because it was a port and the Potomac became unnavigable north of there. The federal government retroceded the Virginia portion of the District of Columbia to the Commonwealth in 1848. Most of the \u201cVirginia\u201d section of D.C. is now comprised of Old Town Alexandria and Arlington County, Va. Stone markers have continued to dot the old boundaries of D.C. in Virginia. One such location is in a church parking lot off of King Street -- the main thoroughfare in Alexandria -- and another, close to the King Street Metro Station in Old Town.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the heart of the problem for the District of Columbia: It has no vote on the House floor and no senators. It\u2019s not a state, so it can\u2019t.\n\nNon-voting Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat, has represented the city in the House since 1991. But, as a \u201cdelegate\u201d to Congress, Norton has been barred from voting on the House floor. House Democrats have allowed non-voting delegates such as Norton and other similar members from Guam and Puerto Rico to vote in a special, parliamentary construct known as \u201cThe Committee of the Whole,\u201d but it\u2019s not quite the same. Norton can serve on committees and introduce bills. She has an office on Capitol Hill. But, there is no vote for D.C.\n\nThe Senate hasn\u2019t officially recognized any such non-voting persons, even though D.C. has elected \u201cshadow senators.\u201d\n\nIn short, the city has had no vote in Congress, yet its residents have paid federal taxes.\n\n\u201cFor Washington, D.C., taxation without representation is more than just a catchy hashtag or bumper-sticker slogan,\u201d Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., said at the hearing.\n\nIn the 1990s, the D.C. city council voted to plaster the phrase \u201ctaxation without representation\u201d across the city\u2019s license plates. Residents could opt out \u2013 including then-President Bill Clinton. The verbiage never appeared on the presidential limo. The other option for the plates was the anodyne \u201ccelebrate and discover.\u201d\n\nThe political makeup of Washington, D.C., has been key to the statehood debate. Washington current has about 700,000 residents, making it more populous than Vermont or Wyoming. Every state scores at least one House member. But, the new state would receive two senators - the same as California or Texas. And, due to the city\u2019s progressive leanings, it\u2019s almost a foregone conclusion that the senators would be Democrats. The lack of balance has concerned Republicans.\n\nWorld War II, the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Cold War, the geostrategic importance of both Alaska and Hawaii and oil reserves in the former accelerated the push for statehood in the 49th and 50th states.\n\nThe U.S. admitted Alaska in January 1959. Hawaii joined in August 1959. Many Hawaiians thought at the time that it would become the 49th state, not Alaska. There was a prominent record label in Hawaii called \u201c49th State\u201d which marketed luau music. But, statehood hinged on two powerful people: Senate Majority Leader and future President Lyndon Johnson, D-Texas, and House Speaker Sam Rayburn, D-Texas. They worked to pair the admission of Alaska with the admission of Hawaii, just months apart.\n\nIt was a compromise, with the expectation that one state would lean toward the Democrats with the other leaning toward the Republicans. But, something strange happened. Back in the late 1950s, Alaska was supposed to be the blue state and Hawaii the red state. In modern days, Alaska has been more conservative and Hawaii more liberal \u2013 although both have had governors, senators and representatives of the other party, even in recent years.\n\nStill, the compromise worked.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Alaska-Hawaii experience would be worth noting. At this point, there has been no \u201coffset\u201d to D.C.\u2019s liberal political base. Even statehood for Puerto Rico would likely result in an influx of Democrats to Capitol Hill. No other \u201ccandidate\u201d territory is seen as conservative.\n\nPolitics is all about compromise. As a result, the lack of political balance likely poses the biggest impediment to D.C. statehood.", "description": "Washington, D.C.,\u00a0is a \u201cfederal enclave\u201d carved out of Maryland and Virginia,\u00a0an odd political subdivision \u2013 and the\u00a0drumbeat has grown to convert the city into a state.", "authors": ["Chad Pergram"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/12/03/694940094001_5974789672001_5974784596001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
