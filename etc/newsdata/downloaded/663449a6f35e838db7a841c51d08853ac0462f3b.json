The national blood pressure has reached danger point. Can our political class really not grasp that they are no longer free to behave as if they were playing teenage games in a college debating society?\n\nEach repeated failure by Parliament to agree on an orderly exit from the EU puts more strain on our constitution. Faith in the House of Commons as a place of wisdom, experience and responsibility, already weakening, has almost entirely gone.\n\nNor will it quickly recover. As the Prime Minister so rightly said during yesterday\u2019s debate, the behaviour of MPs is corroding the public\u2019s trust. Much more of this, and our whole tradition of parliamentary politics may be in danger. There is a feverish, short-tempered mood abroad in the country and it would be unwise for anyone to ignore it.\n\nMPs in the House of Commons debate Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal yesterday\n\nHere are some simple points for anyone in Parliament who still thinks the public will stand endlessly for this sort of behaviour. All peaceful political struggles, at home and abroad, end in compromise, which means giving up things you really want, and accepting things you really hate, for the sake of a lasting, workable bargain.\n\nIt is never especially pretty. The great German statesman Otto von Bismarck advised the over-sensitive that if they enjoyed sausages or politics, they should not watch either being made.\n\nSo it is really no use at all for MPs from any part of the spectrum to get up and say that there are areas of Boris Johnson\u2019s EU deal they do not like.\n\nOf course there are. Nobody likes everything in it. Boris Johnson, we may reasonably guess, does not like a lot of it himself. Nor do the EU leaders who conceded it. Many people loathe large chunks of it. Some people, especially those who want to stay in the EU, do not like anything in it at all.\n\nBut Britain is not a mighty superpower and it has not forced Brussels into unconditional surrender. This is what we could get, and neither charm, nor pressure, nor ingenuity is going to make much difference now.\n\nAnd then there is the other important point. We are all sick of the subject. The Prime Minister, in an effective, thoughtful and magnanimous speech, correctly pointed out that on this one thing the British people and the bureaucrats of Brussels are unusually agreed. They want it to be over.\n\nBoth he and Michael Gove visibly grew in political stature during their Parliamentary performances yesterday, not least because they both spoke for the whole nation.\n\nBoth men, whatever their differences in the past and whatever their failings, now understand very well the heavy burden of responsibility which they have taken on, the ancient weight of kingship which either breaks those who cannot bear it, or swiftly matures them from callow careerists into proper statesmen.\n\nTheresa May also distinguished herself. Her contribution had plenty of wisdom, modesty and good humour. But it also displayed a hardened realist\u2019s scorn for the irresponsible folly of people such as Sir Oliver Letwin, and the little self-important clique \u2013 as usual including the skulking figure of Philip Hammond \u2013 which sustained him.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn, by contrast, shrank in stature as he delivered a leaden coffin of a speech which showed no sign of his own lifelong passion for British independence from the EU.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson delivers a statement in the House of Commons yesterday\n\nIt also cannot have pleased the Europhiles who surround him on his front bench and crowd behind him on the Opposition back benches too. It would be flattering to say that he was going through the motions, given that his performance was so lifeless. But what else could he do? His party\u2019s position is incoherent and dishonest.\n\nHaving been elected in 2017 on a pledge to deliver Brexit, Labour MPs cannot now honourably seek to avoid it when a practicable deal is agreed.\n\nYet so far, only a few Labour members have shown themselves willing to do what the voters have asked them to do.\n\nJust as the Tories who have obstructed Mr Johnson\u2019s agreement deserve severe criticism, the Labour backers of the deal deserve praise. They are not, as their critics claim, betraying their party and its principles. On the contrary, they are speaking for a very large part of Labour\u2019s historic supporters.\n\nThe pro-deal Labour MP Caroline Flint offered a withering dismissal of the Letwin faction, saying their motion was no more than a panic measure, not the supposedly responsible action they claimed. And she gave an equally pithy summary of the supporters of the Benn Act \u2013 which bans a No Deal departure \u2013 saying their aim was in fact to delay Brexit and stop it.\n\nAbsurdly, there are still people in positions of influence who even now hope to prevent us from leaving the EU. Can they not see that such a defiance of democratic will is not just playing with fire? It is playing with plutonium.\n\nThe same can be said for the Democratic Unionist Party, whose behaviour yesterday was shocking and extremely foolish. Everyone grasps that they must stand up for those in the Province who wish to remain British. But that is not a licence for intransigence.\n\nThere are already many important differences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, mainly designed to make it easier for the region to stay in that union. The special status negotiated by the Prime Minister is another such difference. Does the DUP think it would get a better deal from Corbynite Labour or a pro-Dublin EU?\n\nThe seething public desire to get the deal done is not mere impatience (though it is justified). It is not simply exasperation (though there is plenty of that). It shows that practically everyone outside Westminster understands what the fools who sabotaged a decision yesterday seemingly cannot absorb. There is nothing else to be won.\n\nMr Johnson, to the surprise of many, got the EU to shift significantly, and shifted significantly in return, as so often happens in the last few hours of negotiation.\n\nHe can see \u2013 as others apparently cannot \u2013 that even the EU leadership is not interested in dragging the process out for another few months.\n\nIf it is sensible, Brussels will not play the Remainers\u2019 game by granting us yet more time to waste. For the pointless squabbling and petty delaying tactics will expand and extend to fill any and all of the time allowed for it.\n\nThe time for pettifogging, nit-picking and self-important complaining was over long ago. There is a little room left for Parliament to recover its dignity and responsibility.\n\nFor its own sake and for the sake of the country, let us hope the foolishness now ends, and that we can proceed to a deal by October 31.", "description": "Faith in the House of Commons as a place of wisdom, experience and responsibility, already weakening, has almost entirely gone.
