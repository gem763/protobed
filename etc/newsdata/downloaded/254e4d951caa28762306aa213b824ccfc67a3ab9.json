They disputed claims that the attack was the work of Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen \u2014 not Tehran itself.\n\nThe Houthis are engaged in a brutal civil war with a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, but military analysts said the rebel group was not likely to have the arsenal and the sophistication to carry out the Saturday attack.\n\nU.S. and Saudi officials stopped short of explicitly claiming that the attack was launched from Iranian soil, raising questions about how much hard evidence either side has and fueling the perception that both countries are unsure how to move forward.\n\nPresident Trump came under increasing pressure from prominent foreign policy hawks in the Republican Party to respond with a military strike or risk emboldening Iran on the world stage ahead of the United Nations General Assembly gathering in New York next week.\n\n\u201cIf we have to do something, we\u2019ll do it,\u201d the president told reporters in California, explicitly referencing the possibility of direct military action against Iran.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really at a point now where we know very much what happened,\u201d Mr. Trump said, but \u201cthere is a certain guarantee factor\u201d in nailing down hard evidence.\n\nFrance and the United Nations said they were dispatching their own analysts to Saudi Arabia to analyze the attack. Private analysts said the range of the attacks and some of the weaponry displayed clearly ruled out the Houthis as the perpetrators.\n\nThe salvos \u201cdid not come from Yemen,\u201d Michael Elleman, a missile defense analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told The Associated Press. \u201cI think the intel reporting seems to be pretty consistently saying that no, this did not come from Yemen, even though they claimed credit for it.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said he had ordered further Treasury Department sanctions on Iran, but he did not elaborate.\n\nThe U.S. is likely to find it difficult to recruit allies for a military move against Iran. Multiple European countries, China and Russia say Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and the resumption of harsh economic sanctions only heightened the tensions.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Pompeo held a high-stakes meeting with his Saudi counterparts at a crucial moment for both countries. Analysts say Saudi Arabia\u2019s credibility hangs in the balance as it considers how to respond to Iran, its chief political and sectarian rival in the region, while steering clear of any action that could ignite a broader war in the Middle East or spark a conflict that would further destabilize international energy markets.\n\nTop Saudi officials seemed well aware of the tightrope they must walk in laying blame at the feet of Iran. In a widely anticipated news conference, Saudi military spokesman Col. Turki al-Malki said the attack was \u201claunched from the north\u201d and was \u201cunquestionably sponsored\u201d by Iran. He did not, however, say directly that Iranian leaders ordered the attack or that the strike was initiated inside Iranian borders.\n\nCol. al-Malki walked amid pieces of more than two dozen missiles and drones that he said were used in the assault and said they bore a strong resemblance to weapons frequently used by Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of weapon the Iranian regime and the Iranian IRGC are using against the civilian object and facilities infrastructure,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Pompeo dubbed the assault an \u201cIranian attack\u201d and an \u201cact of war.\u201d He pinned the blame squarely on Tehran and dismissed the notion that Houthis in Yemen, who have used Iranian-supplied equipment in the past, were responsible.\n\n\u201cThis is an attack of a scale we\u2019ve just not seen before,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the case that you can subcontract out the devastation of 5% of the world\u2019s global energy supply and think that you can absolve yourself from responsibility,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. \u201cWere it the case that the Houthis\u2019 fraudulent claim was accurate, were that true \u2014 it\u2019s not, but were that true \u2014 it doesn\u2019t change the fingerprints of [Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei] as having put at risk the global energy supply.\u201d\n\nDelicate dance\n\nA potential U.S. response to Iran is just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Regional analysts say Saudi Arabia faces a set of complex geopolitical factors that could impact its security, its economy and its reputation as the crucial hinge supplier for the global oil market.\n\nOn the security front, analysts say, Riyadh has likely made a behind-the-scenes calculation that any military response must be led by its own forces, not by those of the U.S.\n\nAlthough U.S. assistance could be vital, it\u2019s likely the Saudis would insist on taking the lead militarily in order to protect their standing as a top Middle Eastern power.\n\n\u201cIf they were going to do something, they would want to do it right and not be embarrassed,\u201d said James Carafano, a security and foreign policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cIn that part of the world, you want to look strong. The worst thing you can possibly do is look weak. If Saudi Arabia is going to do something, it would be better if they did it [themselves].\u201d\n\nBut the Saudis, with powerful Iranian proxies stationed on their borders in Iraq and Yemen, are also well aware that a confrontation with Tehran could quickly spiral out of control. The careful wording of Saudi public statements in recent days seems designed to buy Riyadh more time to figure out how to retaliate.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis are usually risk averse about this kind of thing,\u201d Mr. Carafano said. \u201cThey\u2019re not the Israelis. If it were the Israelis, there would already be smoke coming out of a hole somewhere in Iran.\u201d\n\nDeeper concerns are also at play. Part of Iran\u2019s grand strategy in its attacks, analysts say, is to weaken Saudi Arabia economically as a method of softening links between Riyadh and Washington. The rivalry between Saudi Arabia, as the leader of Sunni Islam, and Iran, the world\u2019s most powerful Shiite-majority nation, only intensified the conflict.\n\nSaudi Arabia remains Iran\u2019s top foe in the Middle East and has been embraced by Mr. Trump as the key Arab ally in isolating and containing Iran. Inflicting pain on Saudi Arabia, analysts say, could change that dynamic.\n\n\u201cIran now has two imperatives,\u201d leading international affairs strategist George Friedman wrote this week. \u201cIt must weaken the anti-Iran coalition, protecting its allies in the region, and it must generate pressure on the United States to ease U.S. pressure on the Iranian economy. The weak link in the coalition is Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cThe strike at the Saudi oil refinery was well thought out on all levels,\u201d Mr. Friedman wrote in a piece for Geopolitical Futures. \u201cNot only did it demonstrate that the Saudi oil industry was vulnerable to Iranian attack but the attack significantly reduced Saudi oil production, inflicting real pain. It is not clear how long it might take to bring production back online, but even if it is done quickly, the memory will not fade, and if it takes time, the financial impact will hurt.\u201d\n\nThere are also fears that the attack could impact the looming initial public offering of the state-run Saudi Aramco oil giant, expected to be one of the largest public listings in history.\n\nSaudi officials, however, have said there are no plans to delay the offering and have issued statements this week that production at the damaged oil refineries can be restored relatively quickly.\n\nRenewed tensions\n\nFor the Trump White House, last weekend\u2019s attack again brought tensions with Iran to the boiling point \u2014 barely a week after John R. Bolton, the president\u2019s hawkish national security adviser, was ousted, in part over differences on how to deal with Tehran.\n\nIranian officials Wednesday reportedly used Swiss intermediaries to deliver a note to the Trump administration. In the message, they denied responsibility for the Abqaiq incident while vowing to respond in kind if attacked.\n\n\u201cIf any action takes place against Iran, the action will be faced by Iran\u2019s answer immediately,\u201d the note read in part, according to state-run media in Iran.\n\n\u201cThese accusations are wholly, seriously and firmly rejected,\u201d Brig. Gen. Amir Hatami, Iran\u2019s defense minister, told reporters in Tehran. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to accuse someone without providing any proof. It has no value.\u201d\n\nBut the Abqaiq attack is the latest in a string of suspected Iranian provocations that have sent regional tensions soaring. Over the summer, Iran downed an American drone that it said crossed into Iranian airspace \u2014 a claim the U.S. denied. Mr. Trump said he was minutes away from approving a military strike on Iranian targets in response to the downing but ultimately decided against it.\n\nIran in recent months also targeted multiple commercial oil ships traveling off its coast after the U.S. imposed a global embargo on Iranian oil exports. Iran also now boasts that it is disregarding key provisions of the 2015 international nuclear deal and is once again enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels.\n\nAlleged Iranian threats to U.S. forces based in Iraq led to the deployment of additional American troops, planes and ships to the Middle East this summer.\n\nBut even against that backdrop, Mr. Trump had openly mulled a face-to-face meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani next week at the U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders in New York. Such a meeting would have been historic and could have been an opening to renewed diplomatic talks.\n\nNow, however, it\u2019s unclear whether Iranian officials will even be allowed into the U.S. Iranian media reported Wednesday that Mr. Rouhani and Foreign Affairs Minister Javad Zarif have yet to be granted visas.\n\nState Department officials told The Associated Press that they would not discuss \u201cprivate diplomatic correspondence\u201d with Iran, but Mr. Trump signaled that Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Zarif will ultimately be allowed into the U.S.\n\n\u201cI would let them come,\u201d the president told reporters.\n\nBut the White House is facing renewed pressure from top Republicans to show strength through force, particularly with Mr. Bolton no longer at his side.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, called for a \u201cresponse to deter deterrence\u201d and said Iran will not cease provocations on its own.\n\n\u201cIf they do want a war, they will lose it. It is clear to me they\u2019re not much worried about a war,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you were worried about a war, you wouldn\u2019t bomb your neighbor\u2019s refineries. So they believe there\u2019s no stomach in the region or in the United States to confront their aggressive behavior. Radical Islam left unattended, we know what happens. We\u2019ve seen that movie before here at home.\u201d\n\nRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the House, said the U.S. should pursue \u201cproportional\u201d military responses against Tehran.\n\n\u2981 Tom Howell Jr. and Lauren Meier contributed to this article, which is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
