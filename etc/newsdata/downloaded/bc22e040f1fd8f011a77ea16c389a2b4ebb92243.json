Instead it relies on \u201cFace Unlock,\u201d a proprietary facial scanning system similar to the one found in Apple\u2019s Face ID. Early reports show a system that works well, perhaps too well, in fact, according to some security experts.\n\nTo unlock a Pixel, the operator must hold it up to their face while onboard cameras and sensors go to work scanning their mug for defining characteristics \u2014 the distance between your eyes, for example. Once the device is confident it\u2019s you, it unlocks and allows you to access the operating system.\n\nWith Google\u2019s system, according to the BBC, the Pixel\u2019s Face Unlock function works even if a user\u2019s eyes are closed, a clear and security risk for anyone with a Pixel 4. Using default settings, users who are asleep, or even dead, could unknowingly unlock their phone for others.\n\nAccording to Google representatives, \u201cPixel 4 Face Unlock meets the security requirements as a strong biometric.\u201d True, but this in and of itself might not be enough. At its launch, Pixel product manager Sherry Lin said, \u201cThere are actually only two face [authorization] solutions that meet the bar for being super-secure. So, you know, for payments, that level \u2014 it\u2019s ours and Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\nWith Apple\u2019s Face ID, however, the system checks to ensure the user is \u201calert\u201d and looking at the camera. That is to say, Apple reduces the chances for an accidental unlock by requiring the user to look in the general direction of the camera.\n\n\u201cIf someone can unlock your phone while you\u2019re asleep, it\u2019s a big security problem,\u201d cyber-security expert Graham Cluley told BBC. \u201cSomeone unauthorized \u2014 a child or partner? \u2014 could unlock the phone without your permission by putting it in front of your face while you\u2019re asleep. I wouldn\u2019t trust it to secure the private conversations and data on my phone.\u201d\n\nGoogle seems to be aware of the problem, stating on a Pixel 4 help page that: \u201cYour phone can also be unlocked by someone else if it\u2019s held up to your face, even if your eyes are closed.\u201d Google encourages users to keep their phone in a safe place \u201clike your front pocket or handbag\u201d to reduce the likelihood of these events.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about it, you can always turn on \u201clockdown,\u201d which disables features like notifications, and any of the phone\u2019s authentication methods.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bryan Clark"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FGoogle-Pixel-4-header.jpg&signature=9d6093bf3c1a9812d83e0db942a9e1cc", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
