We don\u2019t need to freak out, things like that, but at the end of the day, we control this,\u201d said Jones, who had six receptions for 31 yards and a late touchdown to make the fantasy football players happy while being targeted 11 times by Matt Ryan. \u201cWe\u2019re shooting ourselves in the foot, getting behind the sticks early on, and we couldn\u2019t stay out there on the field, get the defense some rest, things like that. We\u2019ve just got to do better and we will be better. That\u2019s that.\u201d\n\nJones, the six-time Pro Bowl selection who led the league last season with 1,677 receiving yards and is one of only four wide receivers in history with three seasons of at least 100 receptions and 1,500 yards, was blanketed often by a second defender - as the Vikings have usually done against him under head coach Mike Zimmer. During the first of two interceptions by Anthony Harris, he wrestled the ball away from Jones after Ryan tried to thread it between the safety and cornerback Xavier Rhodes in the first quarter.\n\nThe Vikings have beaten the Falcons all four times since Zimmer was hired in 2014 and brought his aggressive defensive scheme with a penchant for shutting down an opponent\u2019s star receiver.\n\n\u201cAnytime you\u2019ve got a dynamic player like that, it\u2019s always a team effort. You can\u2019t expect to put one guy on him,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe have Xavier Rhodes on him, and he did a good job battling him all day. I think the combination of having high coverage and pressure up front has to go hand in hand.\u201d\n\nIn those four losses to the Vikings, Jones has just 19 receptions for 193 yards and the one score.\n\n\u201cWe control all of this. It\u2019s not them, it\u2019s us,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to do better all around the board.\u201d\n\nJones signed a three-year, $66 million extension Saturday before the team boarded the plane for Minnesota, with almost all of the deal fully guaranteed.\n\n\u201cFor me, I just want to be a great teammate. All that other stuff, that\u2019s more so for my family. I\u2019m not a \u2018me\u2019 guy, like, hey, being the highest-paid guy, you this, you that,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI just love to be out there with my guys. My brothers, we go about it every day. I love it, and I\u2019m ready to get back to work.\u201d\n\nThough the negotiations lasted longer than expected, with just one day to go before the season kicked off, Jones said he was never worried, assurance in part that came from owner Arthur Blank and his desire to keep Jones for the remainder of his career.\n\n\u201cI had peace of mind. Talked to Mr. Blank, just talking about how appreciative I am of him and vice versa,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe love I have for the organization, things like that. That\u2019s out the way now. At the end of the day, like I said, it\u2019s more so on us and just getting ready to play football.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons host Philadelphia next, a Sunday night game that will take on even greater urgency.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely a work in progress across the board,\u201d Ryan said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For Julio Jones and the Atlanta Falcons, there will be many games in their future together when the two-time All-Pro takes over and leads the team to victory.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Campbell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/falcons_vikings_football_87592_c0-179-4273-2670_s1770x1032.jpg?69ab4ca1735b0606ed4c0e86251c379f48a8a55d", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
