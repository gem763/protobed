The joy he continually brings to my heart feels like a dream.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still new to all of this but suffice to say, single parenting is not for the faint of heart. Nor is having a child with special needs.\n\n\"But Matthew choosing me has been the greatest gift I have ever received.\u201d\n\nFollow Michele on Instagram.\n\nMatthew is now four and a half months old.
