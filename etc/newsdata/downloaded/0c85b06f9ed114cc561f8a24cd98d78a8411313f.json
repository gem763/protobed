I'm totally not happy at myself and I do not applaud any of [my] actions.'\n\nUnder fire: The Bachelorette's Jess Glasgow (pictured) has been told to resign as a local Noosa councillor after being slammed for his sexist behaviour on the dating show\n\nHe added: 'It's so out of context and I want to make it known I'm not a reality TV guy... I just took it too far and I totally made a poor judgement. It's reality TV, you don't get a second chance. It's \"bang\" and it's out there.'\n\nAfter radio host Jackie 'O' Henderson asked Jess if he'd watched Thursday's episode, he said: '[Yes], until I started cringing and throwing up.'\n\nLater in the interview, Jess said that 'everybody hates [him]' at Noosa council and his fledgling political career is now at risk.\n\nDumped: The local politician was sent home on Thursday's episode of The Bachelorette, after Angie Kent (pictured) confronted him over his inappropriate behaviour\n\nHe revealed: 'The Mayor rang me this morning at 5:30 and said, \"Jess, I'm going to put out a press release. You should be looking at resigning\".'\n\nAfter Jess' interview, Angie called KIIS FM and made it clear she 'didn't ask for him to lose his job' and just wanted to hold him to account for his behaviour.\n\nMeanwhile, Noosa Mayor Tony Wellington told Nova FM's Fitzy and Wippa that he has encouraged Jess to resign from his position as a local councillor.\n\n'It was a rather extreme example of Cr Glasgow's behaviour and it's most disappointing to me and to many other people across Noosa and I'm sure across the country,' Mr Wellington said.\n\nAngie's brutal farewell During Thursday's episode of The Bachelorette, Angie Kent said that Jess 'gave [her] the creeps' during their group date. But she didn't confront him until learning that he had also made female crew members uncomfortable with his persistent flirting. During their showdown at the cocktail party, Angie told Jess: 'You made me feel very uncomfortable at the photo shoot. I said I wanted fun, but I feel like you took it too far. 'I will never allow a man to come in and f**k with my sisterhood. Never. 'I feel like you think this is a joke, and that really annoys me. You never talk about me as a person. You always just talk about me as a piece of meat.' 'I don't trust you and I'm sorry, you're gonna have to leave': Angie scolded Jess for being a creep, telling him he 'took [things] too far' during their group date As Jess interrupted to apologise for 'acting inappropriately', Angie snapped: 'I really don't believe a word that you say. 'I don't trust you and I'm sorry, you're gonna have to leave.' After packing his bags and being driven away in the limousine, Jess denied any wrongdoing. 'Apparently I was a bit crude to her on the photo shoot. That's bulls**t,' he said. 'Apparently that was too sexualising. I don't know. Obviously, it's just a different of opinion. I know deep down nothing happened.' He then added: 'I'm going back to Noosa to find the love of my life in a dirty, dingy nightclub.'\n\n'That sort of misogynistic, crude, offensive behaviour is just not on.\n\n'He certainly wasn't acting on behalf of Noosa council on the show, but he did reference his role on Noosa council which he shouldn't have done, and made in fact some play of the fact he was a politician on the Noosa council.'\n\nMr Wellington explained that because Jess is an elected representative and not an employee of the council 'he can't be fired'.\n\nBut he has nonetheless asked Jess to resign, saying: 'I'll be speaking with Jess about his future on the council. I don't see that he has a future on our council.\n\n'I did speak to him this morning and I told him that my recommendation to him was that he resign from his position as councillor on the Noosa Council.\n\n'He is under the belief that he can brave it out, shall we say... he thinks that it's not as dramatic as some of the reactions I've been receiving.'\n\nJess later told Fitzy & Wippa that he was deeply sorry for what he'd done, describing his actions as 'despicable' and a 'mistake'.\n\n'I'm naturally a little bit of a flirtatious guy [but] I'm truly sorry. Angie deserves a hell of a lot better than that, every woman does,' he said.\n\n'It's been a terrible 24 hours. As you can imagine, it's World War 3.\n\n'Absolutely I cringed, it's not me at all, it's reality TV. I sincerely apologise, I never ever meant to have those words come out that way.'\n\nJess also claimed he did not remember calling Angie a 'b***h' at the cocktail party, despite being caught using the slur on camera.\n\nHe said: 'Well, in the cocktail parties you forget that everything's being filmed.'\n\nRadio host Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald noted that Jess sounded 'shattered' on the phone, but the embattled Sunshine Coast councillor said he was hopeful his career will survive.\n\n'This isn't me, I'm not this guy and I know that. I hold women's rights dearly to my heart,' he said.\n\nJess was sent home on Thursday's episode of The Bachelorette, after Angie Kent confronted him over his inappropriate behaviour.\n\nFans across the country have slammed the 37-year-old politician, taking to Twitter to label him 'disgusting', 'creepy' and 'vile'.\n\nDuring the episode, Jess made crude sexual remarks about Angie, called her a 'b**ch' and flirted awkwardly with female crew members.\n\n'You should be looking at resigning': Noosa Mayor Tony Wellington (pictured) revealed on Friday morning that he had told Jess to resign from his position as a local councillor\n\nAngie: 'Why Jess shouldn't be fired' Speaking on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Friday, Angie said that Jess shouldn't lose his job over the scandal. After listening to audio of Jess' grovelling on-air apology, she said: 'I'm not asking him to lose his job, I just stuck up for myself and other women he was making uncomfortable.

Props to Angie looking out for the sisterhood.'\n\nDespite the overwhelming support for Angie, one viewer pointed out that it was unfair of the producers to allow Jess' behaviour to escalate to that level.\n\nShow of support! Angie was widely praised on Twitter for how she handled the situation\n\n'It is awesome that Angie told him off and sent him on his disgusting way, but why did she have to do it?' they tweeted.\n\n'Shouldn't he have been booted by the producers the second he harassed anyone? Not as good TV I know, but why let him stay a second longer?'\n\nAnother wrote: 'If Jess was being inappropriate to the staff, Channel 10 should have acted before it got to this stage. Nobody deserves to be sexually harassed at their workplace.'\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 for comment.\n\nNot happy!
