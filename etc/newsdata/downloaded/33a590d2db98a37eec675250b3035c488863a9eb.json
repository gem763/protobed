The reading is the lowest since June 2009 and represents a continuation of the slowdown seen in August, when the index contracted for the first time since August 2016. Economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal expected a 50.1 reading for September.\n\nReadings above 50 indicate an expansion in manufacturing activity, while those below 50 indicate a contraction. The index is based on survey data from manufacturing purchasing managers and executives nationwide.\n\nISM's new orders index -- one of the measures that contributes to the overall manufacturing index -- registered at 47.3 for September, a slight increase from 47.2 in August. Newly placed orders for manufactured goods are seen as a proxy for business investment and consumer demand.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Commerce Department reported orders for durable goods -- products designed to last at least three years -- increased 0.2% in August from July. Meanwhile, orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft fell 0.2% from the prior month. Several economists cut their forecasts for third quarter U.S. gross domestic product following the durable goods data and figures that showed U.S. households cut back on spending in August from the prior month.\n\nOn Tuesday, a separate measure of U.S. manufacturing activity from IHS Markit showed factory output increased in September, though the reading also showed the third quarter was the worst quarterly performance for the sector since 2009.\n\nOther recent data have signaled the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China is weighing on both U.S. and global manufacturing, although the U.S. appears to be faring slightly better.\n\nU.S. industrial production -- a measure of factory, mining and utility output -- rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in August from the prior month, a reading that beat economists' expectations. Surveys of purchasing managers released Tuesday pointed to a continued decline in factory output in Asia and Europe during September, partly because of falling export orders.\n\nWrite to Amara Omeokwe at amara.omeokwe@wsj.com and Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 01, 2019 10:37 ET (14:37 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
