He was promoted to ITN's news editor and then industrial editor before becoming a presenter of ITN's News at One in 1978.\n\nImage caption He took over from Robin Day as presenter of Question Time\n\nHe later moved to Channel 4 to present the channel's early evening news before joining the BBC in 1989. At the corporation, he hosted Question Time until 1993, and also presented the Nine O'Clock News and 10 O'Clock News.\n\nIn 2002, he faced criticism for wearing a burgundy-coloured tie rather than the customary black when breaking the news of the Queen Mother's death.\n\nSissons retired from broadcasting in 2009. Two years later, he published an autobiography in which he criticised the BBC for having what he saw as a left-wing bias.\n\nLord Hall said: \"Peter Sissons was one of the great television figures of his time - as an interviewer, presenter and world-class journalist. During his distinguished career he was one of the most recognisable and well-respected faces of television news.\n\n\"He was always a great person to be with and to work with. He will be missed by his many friends and colleagues and our thoughts are with his family.\"\n\nA statement from Sissons' management company said he \"died peacefully\" in Maidstone Hospital in Kent on Tuesday.\n\n\"His wife and three children were with him and wish to pass on their thanks to the hospital staff,\" it added.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
