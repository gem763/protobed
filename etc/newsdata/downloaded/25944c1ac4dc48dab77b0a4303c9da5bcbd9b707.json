Mr. Trump had tweeted that Alabama would be impacted by Hurricane Dorian. \"In addition to Florida \u2014 South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated,\" he wrote Sunday morning.\n\nThe Birmingham National Weather Service disputed that just minutes later in a tweet: \"Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service Employees Organization pushed back against NOAA, with the organization's president calling the NOAA statement \"utterly disgusting and disingenuous.\"\n\nLet me assure you the hard working employees of the NWS had nothing to do with the utterly disgusting and disingenuous tweet sent out by NOAA management tonight #NOAA \u2014 Dan Sobien (@pres_nwseo) September 6, 2019\n\nThe hurricane advisories in the NOAA link show that at 8 a.m. Sunday \u2014 a couple of hours before Mr. Trump's tweet \u2014 there was a 5% to 10% chance that tropical-storm-force winds of more than or equal to 39 miles per hour could affect the Southeast corner of Alabama. The map showed that coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas had a higher likelihood of sustaining tropical storm-force winds, closer to 50% to 70%.\n\nNational Hurricane Center\n\nThe president has been railing against the media for its coverage questioning the veracity of his claim.\n\n\"The Fake News Media was fixated on the fact that I properly said, at the beginnings of Hurricane Dorian, that in addition to Florida & other states, Alabama may also be grazed or hit. They went Crazy, hoping against hope that I made a mistake (which I didn't). Check out maps...\" the president tweeted Friday morning.\n\nThe Trump campaign decided to exploit the situation by selling sets of black markers. They have \"the special ability to drive CNN and the rest of the fake news crazy!\" said campaign manager Brad Parscale.", "description": "President Trump has been slamming the media for the coverage of his claim that Alabama was in grave danger from Hurricane Dorian", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/29/0a29d008-ae46-4e99-b300-93e27828e182/thumbnail/1200x630/40ae14190bd7d89123364faa648de9c9/gettyimages-1164696989.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
