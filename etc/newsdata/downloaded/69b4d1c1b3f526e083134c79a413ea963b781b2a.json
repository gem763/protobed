The other 19 open schemes each had less than 6% market share.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough the restricted schemes market almost mirrors the open scheme market, it comprises more schemes.\n\n\u201cIn 2017 the Government Employees Medical Scheme (Gems) had a market share of 46% with the SA Police Service Medical Scheme being the next-largest restricted scheme with 13%.\n\nThe remaining 58 schemes each had a market share below 6%.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, restricted schemes do not compete for members and will experience growth only if the employer group or industry in which they operate grows.\u201d\n\nAmong its recommendations, the report highlighted that the commission should review its approach towards creeping mergers to reduce the high levels of concentration and establish a dedicated supply-specific healthcare regulatory authority, which would regulate suppliers of services, including facilities and practitioners, a side of the sector, Ngcobo said, that was largely unregulated. It should also set up a tariff \u201cbargaining council-type\u201d forum which would serve as a multilateral negotiating forum for all practitioners to set maximum tariffs and prices.\n\nRegulation\n\n\u201cWe recommend that regulation of the supply-side of the market is essential and ideally administered through a new regulatory authority that we have called a supply-side regulator for health. We have considered with great care the establishment of this regulator and have made a proposal where the net number of regulators will not change.\n\n\u201cWe further consider it to be a positive contribution to the private and public sector. The UK National Health Service has shown that even a mature single public purchaser system requires regulatory oversight of suppliers by an industry-specific regulator.\n\n\u201cMoreover, those suppliers are, and need to be, subject to competition laws and to enforcement action by competition authorities,\u201d Ngcobo said.\n\nThe report recommended that the Health Professions Council of SA also needed to change its rules and make it mandatory that curriculums for all health practitioners at both undergraduate and postgraduate level include training to ensure that graduates were aware of the cost implications oftheir decisions.\n\nNgcobo said: \u201cWe have identified features that alone or in combination, prevent, restrict or distort competition.\n\n\u201cThe market is characterised by highly concentrated funders and facilities markets, disempowered and uninformed consumers, a general absence of value-based purchasing, practitioners, who are subject to little regulation, and failures of accountability at many levels.\u201d", "description": "The three biggest schemes \u2013 Netcare, Mediclinic and Life Healthcare \u2013 make it hard for newcomers to grow and compete on merit, report finds.", "authors": ["Lesetja Malope"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8915/268f0de8e5ec465aaa03d6e0f9cfe63f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
