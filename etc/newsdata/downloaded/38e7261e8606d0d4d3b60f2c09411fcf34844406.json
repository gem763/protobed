(AP) - Testing of zero-emission electric shuttles has begun at Sabino Canyon, a population outdoor recreation site on the outskirts of Tucson.\n\nCoronado National Forest officials believe the new 62-passenger electric shuttles will go into use this fall, replacing 21-passenger gas-powered vehicles being used on an interim basis.\n\nThe Arizona Daily Star reports that the first electric shuttle was tested Sept. 3.\n\nThe shuttle is being used to train drivers along the routes through Sabino and Bear canyons, about 6 miles (9.6 kilometers) of travel.\n\nSabino Canyon attracts 1 million visitors annually.\n\nCoronado National Forest officials say four other open-air shuttles are being tested by California-based Trams International before providing services to about 100,000 annual riders.\n\nWhen operational, the electric shuttles are expected to provide quieter and more efficient travel seven days a week.\n\nThe shuttles also will bring fully integrated ticket sales, including cellphone payments and credit- and debit-card sales for visitors. The previous shuttle vendor operated on a cash-only basis.\n\n\u201cSome people just like to ride up the canyon and return, some people may want to get off at one stop and walk to another stop, some folks may want to stop and have a picnic and then get back on later,\u201d said forest spokeswoman Heidi Schewel. \u201cIt just gives people more options on what they can do throughout their day once they\u2019ve purchased their ticket.\u201d\n\nShe said another feature the shuttles will have is headphones for the narrated educational program.\n\nThe program will be available in English and Spanish.\n\nAccording to the Star, the project needed to supply power to the vehicle charging infrastructure was completed by Tucson Electric Power in April.\n\nTEP has also contributed $1.5 million in startup costs and a $1 million interest-free, 10-year loan funded from its corporate resources.\n\nThe 21-passenger shuttles were ordered for interim use after Sabino Canyon lost shuttle service in June 2018 when a service permit with Sabino Canyon Tours Inc. expired. The private concessionaire had operated at Sabino Canyon since 1985.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Arizona Daily Star, http://www.tucson.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Testing of zero-emission electric shuttles has begun at Sabino Canyon, a population outdoor recreation site on the outskirts of Tucson.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
