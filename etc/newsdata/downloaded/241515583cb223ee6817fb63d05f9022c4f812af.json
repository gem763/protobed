Top Oil Trader Sees \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 Uncertainty\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Oil prices might have been relatively calm over the last couple of months, but the levers pushing and pulling them have reached \u201cin some cases unprecedented\u201d levels of uncertainty, according to Vitol Group.\n\nRisks including Iran, the U.S.-China trade war and growth in electric vehicles are pulling crude in different directions, resulting in a relatively stable price range, said Giovanni Serio, global head of research for Vitol, the world\u2019s biggest independent oil trader. Ample spare capacity -- in OPEC and U.S. shale -- is also countering any upward pressure on prices, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a risk of increasing volatility,\u201d Serio said in an interview on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference in Singapore. \u201cWhether you can put a direction to the volatility is your call.\u201d\n\nThe lack of clarity is partially down to the fact that no one is sure about future demand levels. The International Energy Agency\u2019s 2018 high-case estimate for where consumption would be in a decade was 20 million barrels a day above its low-demand scenario, Serio said, compared with a range of 6 million barrels a day in its 10-year outlook in 2010.\n\nGeopolitical disputes, a global trade environment that\u2019s been upended by aggressive U.S. policy, and an unprecedented amount of debt returning negative yields are the biggest factors buffeting oil prices, according to Serio. When all these uncertainties come from outside the market, \u201cit\u2019s difficult for oil people in general to appreciate,\u201d he said.", "description": "Top Oil Trader Sees \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 Uncertainty", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED9C1EL_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
