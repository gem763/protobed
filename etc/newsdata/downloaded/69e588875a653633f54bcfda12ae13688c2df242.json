I do not care who did what. It does not matter.\n\n\u2018The three of you together \u2013 the two of you and the other person \u2013 caused him a very serious injury and are all responsible for that. You could have killed him.\n\nThe 15-year-old allegedly said \u2018this is Whitley bruv, I\u2019ll smash your windows in\u2019 during the attack (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018You may think it is easy for the judge to say that, but these things do happen. He had a heart attack. He suffered life-changing injuries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It is easy to act tough but I expect the reality is that both of you were very scared when you got arrested. At one point, you were looking both at being locked up.\n\n\u2018It is always depressing when people as young as you two are in court and I hope the court does not have to see you again.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
