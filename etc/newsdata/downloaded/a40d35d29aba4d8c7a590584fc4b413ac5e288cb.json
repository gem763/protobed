Sign up here.\n\nA pathologist hired by Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s brother is now backing the conspiracy theory that the accused child sex trafficker might\u2019ve died by homicide \u2014 not suicide \u2014 in his Manhattan jail cell in August.\n\nNew York City\u2019s chief medical examiner, however, has disputed any claims of homicide and says the convicted sex offender committed suicide.\n\nMichael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner and a contributor to Fox News, told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Wednesday morning that Epstein\u2019s injuries were consistent with homicidal strangulation and \u201cextremely unusual in suicidal hangings.\u201d Baden observed New York City\u2019s official autopsy, according to the New York Times.\n\nBaden also said his evidence isn\u2019t conclusive yet and that he\u2019s still in the process of investigating the wealthy financier\u2019s death, which left his alleged victims outraged.\n\nBaden\u2019s statements fall in line with accusations from right-wing groups like QAnon \u2014 and promoted by President Donald Trump \u2014 that Epstein was killed. But New York City\u2019s chief medical examiner, Barbara Sampson, has said that Epstein died by suicide when he tied a bedsheet to his jail-cell bunk bed and knelt to the floor, using so much force that he broke bones in his neck.\n\nREAD: The Epstein scandal is giving QAnon everything Pizzagate couldn't\n\nThe severe neck injuries were part of the reason people speculated that 66-year-old Epstein was murdered by strangulation, rather than died by suicide.\n\n\u201cIt appears that this could have been a mistake,\u201d Baden said of the medical examiner\u2019s conclusions. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence here of homicide that should be investigated, to see if it is or isn\u2019t homicide.\u201d\n\nEpstein was accused of trafficking dozens of young girls around the world between 2002 and 2005 and was being held without bail in a Manhattan jail on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy at the time of his death. He faced up to 45 years in prison.\n\nThe jail was reportedly severely short-staffed at the time of Epstein\u2019s death, and although Epstein had threatened suicide in the weeks leading up to his hanging, he was left alone. Attorney General William Barr announced a federal investigation into the jail\u2019s practices and the circumstances surrounding Epstein\u2019s Aug. 10 death.\n\nCover image: FILE - This March 28, 2017, file photo, provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein.
