I respect that, but it is terrible to watch.\u201d\n\nHowever, it nearly worked and Wijnaldum knows Holland will need to have better answers next month.\n\n\u201cIt was uncomfortable but it\u2019s because they made it difficult for us with the style they were playing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey were really direct, playing the long ball and winning the second ball.\n\n\u201cThey dropped real deep and tried to make it almost impossible for us to play the football we like to play. And they did it really well.\u201d\n\nVictory for Northern Ireland next month would see O\u2019Neill\u2019s men head to Frankfurt for their final qualifier against Germany still in with a chance.\n\nThough the play-offs look like a better bet now, Leicester defender Jonny Evans said Thursday\u2019s performance gives them belief.\n\n\u201cIt shows we can compete with these teams and we can be proud of certain aspects of our game,\u201d Evans said.\n\n\u201cThe manager always looks at things to improve after the game but the most important thing is that we have come a long way tactically.\n\n\u201cThe manager always has us well organised and disciplined. It was a different type of game we had to play and I thought we carried out that plan very well.\u201d\n\nBefore those final two qualifiers comes Monday\u2019s friendly against the Czech Republic in Prague.\n\nO\u2019Neill will make several changes, with Michael McGovern expected to start in goal.\n\nThe Norwich keeper came into the international window having recently made his Premier League debut at the age of 35, something he called a \u201cspecial achievement\u201d.\n\nIt was McGovern\u2019s first league appearance for the Canaries since April 27. It has been a frustrating wait for a player who joined in 2016 with the goal of being first-choice, but he has had to bide his time behind the likes of Angus Gunn and Tim Krul.\n\nHe considered leaving in the summer before signing a two-year contract extension.\n\n\u201cI had to take things into account as well off the pitch,\u201d said McGovern, who believes training regularly with the likes of Teemu Pukki helps him continue to improve.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Premier League football club, you get well looked after, it\u2019s a good club. For me to turn down the opportunity to stay there would have been inadvisable. Not a good idea.\u201d\n\nKrul and Ralf Fahrmann are expected to return soon so McGovern\u2019s stint in the side may be brief, but he has still played more football this season than Northern Ireland\u2019s established number one Bailey Peacock-Farrell, who has only made Burnley\u2019s bench once since joining in the summer.\n\nMcGovern would love to take his Northern Ireland shirt too.\n\n\u201cI think Bailey is a lovely fella and a great keeper,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously I would love to get back to the Northern Ireland position but it\u2019s not down to me. I can only control what I can control and train as hard as I can I train. That\u2019s all I can do.\n\n\u201cWhen you have possession of the jersey sometimes it is up to you to claim it back.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Liverpool\u2019s Georginio Wijnaldum will be braced for a tough night when Holland\u00a0visit Windsor Park next month after Northern Ireland\u00a0threatened to pull off a shock win in Rotterdam on Thursday.
