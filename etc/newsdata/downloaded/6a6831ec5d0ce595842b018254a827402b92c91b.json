We know she gets the mile and a half and handles an ease in the ground, she was back to a mile and a quarter today on fast ground and Ryan gave her a lovely, uncomplicated ride.\"\n\nIf that wasn't enough, both Magic Wand and Anthony Van Dyck -- also trained by O'Brien -- finished second and third respectively, serving to underline the trainer's dominance.\n\nIt was an O'Brien who also trained the winner of the day's only other Group 1 race, although this time it was left to Aidan's son, Joseph.\n\nHe watched on as Iridessa took the honors in the Coolmore Fastnet Rock Matron Stakes.\n\nRunners break from the stalls in the back straight at Curragh racecourse.\n\nIrish St. Leger\n\nSunday saw nine races from the historic Curragh racecourse but, surprisingly, did not see another win for the O'Brien family.\n\nIf the Irish Champion Stakes was the highlight of the first day, then the Irish St. Leger was certainly the headline for the second.\n\nThis time it was fellow Irish trainer Dermot Weld who was celebrating as his horse Search For A Song held on to claim victory.\n\nWeld -- who has been named Ireland's champion trainer on 21 occasions -- has now trained eight winners of the Irish St. Leger.\n\nHowever, this year's winner -- ridden by Chris Hayes -- was not widely tipped and did not get off to best of starts.\n\n\"I'm half-shaken a little bit. Nothing really went right at the start and you normally go out in these races and have a plan,\" Hayes said after the race.\n\n\"I knew after a furlong I'd be getting into a row with her.\"\n\nSearch For A Song wins the Irish St. Leger in 2019.\n\nThe festival was not only a chance to watch some of the world's best thoroughbreds, but it also celebrated elegant fashion, gourmet food and drink and other entertainment.", "description": "Ireland is synonymous with horse racing and the country was able to celebrate its rich history with the world at this weekend's showpiece event.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190916090843-curargh-racing-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
