Impish figurine's exploits prompts television comeback with 15 new episodes", "language": "en", "text": "Morph, the animated clay figurine, is set to return to UK screens with 15 new episodes.\n\nPeter Lord, who created the character with David Sproxton, has revealed that new five-minute episodes are being created so the impish figure will be introduced to a new audience.\n\nMorph made his debut in 1977 alongside artist and TV presenter Tony Hart.\n\nPeter Lord, who created the character with David Sproxton, has revealed that new five-minute episodes are being created so the impish figure will be introduced to a new audience\n\nThe mischievous creature was seen getting into trouble and causing problems for Hart by spilling paint and interfering in his artworks.\n\nMorph, who lived in a wooden pencil box, would appear in short segments throughout the show and cause trouble before morphing back into a plain ball of clay.\n\nLord and Sproxton always created Morph using one 162-gram ball of hand-formed clay.\n\nTo make sure the ball always weighed the same amount, they weighed it on an old scale they found in a junk shop in Bristol.\n\nThey marked the right weight with a sticker with the letter 'M'.\n\nMorph made his debut in 1977 alongside artist and TV presenter Tony Hart. And later on he was joined by a white clay friend called Chas, who joined him on his adventures\n\nSince Morph has left screens, fans have taken to creating their own versions (pictured) and taking pictures of them\n\nMorph appeared in seven different programmes over two decades, including Take Hart, Hartbeat and SMart.\n\nAnd later on Morph was joined by a white clay friend called Chas, who joined him on his adventures.\n\nLord and Sproxton always created Morph using one 162-gram ball of hand-formed clay\n\nShortly after Hart died in 2009, a flashmob of Morph characters was organised outside the Tate Modern in London.\n\nMorph was the first success of Lord and Sproxton, who had recently founded Aardman Animations.\n\nThe production company then went on to create other classics such as Wallace and Gromit, Chicken Run and Shaun the Sheep.\n\nA series of new one-minute Morph episodes was released on YouTube in 2014 after a Kickstarter campaign raised \u00a3110,000 to part-fund it.\n\nThe episodes were then broadcast on CBBC the next year.\n\nLord told BBC Orkney this week: 'As we speak, back at the studio in Bristol, they're building the sets in readiness.'\n\nHe revealed that because Morph's design is so simple, any minor deviation from his classic look becomes immediately obvious.\n\nHe said: 'You have to be a sculptor as well as an animator.\n\n'It's visual comedy. You have to do it all by body, expressions, and good visual joke telling. So I look at Buster Keaton films and Charlie Chaplin films, to remember what great silent comedy can be.'\n\nShortly after Hart (pictured) died in 2009, a flashmob of Morph characters was organised outside the Tate Modern in London", "description": "Morph was created by Peter Lord and David Sproxton of Aardman Animations.
