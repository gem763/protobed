Here\u2019s a quick rundown of each of the new features, how to find them, and why you may want to try them out.\n\nGoogle Maps incognito mode\n\nGoogle will soon be adding an incognito mode to Google Maps that will allow users to search and navigate to locations without saving their activity to their accounts. Google Maps\u2019 incognito mode will be rolling out to the Android app first over the coming weeks, though it\u2019s expected to launch on iOS shortly after.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how this will be toggled in the Google Maps app just yet, but the reason for its inclusion seems pretty obvious, as it provides users immediate control over how much of their location history is collected and shared with Google\u2014pretty much the exact same reason why the incognito modes found in Chrome and YouTube exist. While you can already delete location history and Maps activity from your Google account, and you can even disable your device\u2019s GPS settings entirely, an incognito mode is much more convenient.\n\nYouTube history auto-deletion\n\nScreenshot: Brendan Hesse\n\nYouTube already gave users granular control over their watch and search history, but you can now delete YouTube data every few months if you prefer.\n\nThis feature already exists for web and location activity, and it works the same way on YouTube. Users designate a recurring timeframe for their history to be deleted\u2014currently every three or 18 months\u2014and Google will automatically clear all saved data at that point.\n\nYou can set this up right now by going to your Google account\u2019s My Activity page for YouTube, then clicking/tapping the \u201cChoose to delete automatically\u201d link and select the interval that works for you. However, if you would prefer to manually delete your YouTube history (either en masse or selectively), or even pause activity tracking on YouTube altogether, you can find out how to do so here.\n\nDelete recent Google Assistant commands\n\nYou can now tell Google Assistant to delete your recent voice activity with simple voice controls, like, \u201cHey Google, delete what I just said,\u201d or \u201cdelete what I said on [date.]\u201d Unfortunately, you can only delete previous voice activity from the past seven days this way, but older Google Assistant data can be easily managed and cleared in the Google Assistant app or in your Google Account\u2019s My Activity menu.\n\nDespite being limited to only the past week of activity, we\u2019re happy to see Google finally catch up to Amazon\u2019s recent updates to Alexa and let you verbally instruct Google Assistant to delete your history.\n\nGoogle password checkup\n\nLastly, Google is now directly integrating its password protection tool into its Password Manager. The password checkup monitors your login data and alerts you if:\n\nA password is too weak,\n\nYou\u2019re reusing the same password too often,\n\nOr if your account credentials match any that have been listed in data breaches.\n\nScreenshot: Brendan Hesse\n\nTo run the checkup, go to passwords.google.com and click the \u201cCheck passwords\u201d link, then click \u201cCheck Passwords\u201d again on the next page. You\u2019ll be asked to confirm your identity by signing into your Google account. The checkup will take a few moments to run, and then give you a report card with suggested changes, if any.\n\nSome readers may be sceptical of giving Google access to your login information, but Google at least appears to be taking steps to keep your accounts safe. Google\u2019s official announcement for the new password checkup feature stresses that the process is fully encrypted and Google does not collect, share, or let the company see your password data.\n\nWhether you take Google\u2019s word for it is up to you, but it does seem to be aware of the potential security concerns. That said, you can look into another password manager instead if using Google\u2019s password tolls makes you squeamish, and if you\u2019re feeling really uneasy, you can always quit Google altogether.", "description": "Google recently announced a few new features that give users more control over their data, including three new privacy options for Google Maps, YouTube and Google Assistant, as well as a new tool for monitoring password security.
