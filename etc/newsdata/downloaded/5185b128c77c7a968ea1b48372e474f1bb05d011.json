Protesters started throwing stones at a group of police, who then started to run away.\n\nThe policewoman in the photo, Medikintos Inabeza, 33, got left behind and then some protesters started to push her, saying that she had shot a female protestor in the stomach with an AK47 rifle. I didn\u2019t see anything of that.\n\nThere were 5 or 10 protesters pushing the policewoman at first, then others came and joined in. Up to 20 or 30 protesters were surrounding her at one point. The protesters kicked and beat her very badly; I also saw a couple of knives. I thought they were going to kill her. The people attacking her were really aggressive.\n\nWhat was really surprising to me was that the other police abandoned her when the stones were thrown. Maybe some were initially too scared to help, other than the two policemen who were doing what they could to rescue her. There was even one protester who tried to protect the policewoman.\n\nThe whole thing lasted 20 or 30 minutes. It ended when, for some reason that was hard to figure out, the protestors let the policewoman go, handing her over to another group of police further on.\n\nI was the only photographer there when this incident happened. Up to now the protesters and police have been friendly towards me. It\u2019s a volatile situation.\n\nI\u2019ve been in situations with angry crowds before but I\u2019ve never seen something like this. Pictures sometimes tell a bigger story than words. This was one of those occasions.", "description": "Police fired guns and teargas towards protesters throwing stones in a suburb of Burundi's capital during a demonstration against the president's bid for a third term.
