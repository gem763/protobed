The 48-year-old's wife, Stephanie Bissland (right) on Thursday staunchly defended him\n\nBissland, 69, said Smith has never been violent and she does not believe the allegations\n\nThe wife revealed that the South African native became a naturalized US citizen on September 20 - just over two weeks after the murder\n\nBissland told the station she learned of her husband's arrest when two detectives from the Anchorage Police Department tracked her down in Virginia, where she was visiting family this week.\n\nThe woman said she was shocked by the allegations against her husband, who had just become a naturalized citizen on September 20, just over two weeks after Henry's murder.\n\n'Never in my life would I have thought what they are saying is going on... I don't believe it,' the wife said.\n\nBissland added: 'I'll stand behind him, beside him, while he's going through this.'\n\nAnchorage police linked Smith to the memory card labeled 'homicide at midtown Marriott' found on the street,' which allegedly contained 39 photos and 12 videos of the suspect brutally assaulting and strangling the nude Henry on the floor of the TownePlace Suites by Marriott.\n\nIn one of the videos he was allegedly heard screaming at the victim: 'Just ... die.'\n\nDetectives identified Smith as the person who recorded the crime after recognizing his distinct accent from a separate, unspecified investigation.\n\nSmith, 48, was arrested on Tuesday after police linked him to a memory card found on the street that was labeled 'homicide at midtown Marriott'. The SD card allegedly contained 39 photos and 12 videos of the suspect brutally assaulting and strangling a woman in a hotel room at the TownePlace Suites by Marriott (pictured) in Anchorage\n\nAn affidavit described in gruesome detail how the videos showed he victim, Kathellen Jo Henry, being beaten on a hotel room floor as she attempted to fight back.\n\nThe footage - time-stamped September 4 - showed the woman with long dark hair being strangled as her assailant stomped on her throat.\n\nHours later the videos showed the suspect carrying her body through the hotel parking lot in a white sheet and placing it in a pickup truck that matched one Smith shares with his wife.\n\nThe dozens of photos showed Henry lying naked on the hotel carpet with a bruised left eye, bloodied blue lips and red marks on her face.\n\nPolice believe Smith (pictured with his wife in 2014) took all of the crime scene photos and videos himself. It is unclear whether he knew the victim beforehand\n\nAn Anchorage resident came across the stray memory card on the street near her neighborhood grocery store on September 30.\n\nCurious about the 'homicide' label, she opened the card on her computer and discovered the cache of horrific images before alerting the police.\n\nTwo days later, remains were found about 20 miles south of Anchorage along the Seward Highway on October 2.\n\nPolice believe those remains belong to the same woman murdered in the video.\n\nAccording to a Facebook page associated with Henry, the woman was a native of Eek, Alaska, and lived in Anchorage.\n\nOver the past few months, Henry had been posting status updates that revealed certain details of her biography, including that she was divorced, that she had dropped out of high school at age 14 and earned her GED in 2012 while serving time in jail.\n\nRecords available through the Anchorage Court System's website paint a picture of a turbulent life marred by multiple convictions and jail stints.\n\nHenry's arrest record stretches back to at least 2007 and includes a litany of charges, including multiple counts of assault, disorderly conduct, reckless driving, criminal trespass, resisting arrest, vehicle theft, DUI, theft and vehicle trespassing, among others.\n\nHer most recent run-in with the law took place in January 2019, when Henry was picked up for assault. She pleaded guilty in that case in June.\n\nIt is unknown at this time where and how Henry first came in contact with Smith.\n\nSmith's cell phone records put him near where the body was found, according to the affidavit.\n\nHis vehicle was registered to the hotel on the night the killing took place.\n\nPolice are still working to determine whether the woman knew Smith and how she ended up in the hotel room.\n\nPolice believe human remains found on a highway about 20 miles south of Anchorage on October 2 belonged to the woman who was murdered in the hotel room. Investigators are pictured at the scene where the remains were discovered\n\nSmith was arrested at Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage on Tuesday as he returned home from a trip.\n\nHe was arraigned in court on Wednesday and is being held on $750,000 bond. Court records did not list an attorney for Smith.\n\nAccording to his Facebook page, Smith was born in Queenstown, South Africa, and has been married to an Alaska native since 2014.\n\nPolice did not disclose the nature of the previous investigation that led them to recognize Smith's accent in the memory card images.\n\nIn a news release Wednesday, police thanked the Anchorage woman who turned in the memory card and said the discovery was 'instrumental' in Smith's arrest.\n\n'Had the citizen not called us after she found the video card, we would not have been able to solve this crime as quickly as we did,' Anchorage Police Department spokesman MJ Thim told KTVA.\n\nThim said investigators initially questioned whether the crimes recorded on the SD card had been staged.\n\n'We quickly ruled that out,' he said, 'and then started to piece together from the video, from the visual aspects for the images, and also the audio, we were able to quickly determine where this took place and we were starting to put together the timeline.'", "description": "Stephanie Bissland, 69, the wife of Brian Smith, 48, accused of strangling to death Alaska Native Stephanie Henry, 30, in an Anchorage hotel last month, is defending and standing by him.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets", "Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/21/19606386-0-image-a-44_1570825766418.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
