I remember back at the start wanting to drive so badly as I saw it as freedom and so I\u2019m really proud that I passed my driving test seven years ago.\n\n\"It made a massive difference to my life. I\u2019m now able to get out independently and for me, that\u2019s a big deal.\"\n\nThe Stroke Association research also found that 89% of survivors \u201clive in fear of having another stroke\u201d, while 79% are \u201cafraid for their recovery\u201d.\n\nThe charity\u2019s research (which they say comes from a survey of more than 1,000 stroke survivors) also found one in five (20%) stroke survivors keep their fears to themselves.\n\nNiall said: \u201cI love exercising. I do it because it helps me and every day I exercise, makes me stronger and that little bit better.\n\n\"Swimming is very important to me now, not only because it helps me with my physical recovery from stroke but also, it\u2019s a great way for me to unwind and clear my head when things get on top of me.\n\n\"I\u2019m proud that I\u2019m able to drive and swim and that I can walk again but to me, it isn\u2019t good enough yet and there\u2019s still work to be done.\n\n\"The team from the Stroke Association have helped me to focus on my goals and rebuilding my life after stroke.\"\n\nThe study also discovered only 18% of stroke survivors were \u201cconfident that they would get enough support to make a good recovery\u201d; 87% of stroke survivors \u201cfeared losing their independence\u201d and that 81% \u201cwere afraid they wouldn\u2019t be able to look after their children or parents\u201d.\n\nJuliet Bouverie, Chief Executive of the Stroke Association, said: \u201cThese stats are truly shocking. I am heartbroken to hear that stroke survivors felt they couldn\u2019t speak to those closest to them about their biggest worries and fears.\n\n\"When you live in isolation, too afraid to leave the house and are unable to ask for help, your motivation can disappear, and can leave you in a very bad place emotionally \u2013 feeling like a prisoner in your own home.\n\n\u201cIt takes a team to rebuild lives after stroke. When stroke strikes, part of your brain shuts down, and so does a part of you. Recovery is tough, but with the right specialist support, the brain can adapt after stroke.\n\n\"I\u2019ve heard countless stories, and know countless people who, after many years continue to make remarkable recoveries.\n\n\u201cThe first step to eliminating fear is to ask for help and support.\n\n\"If you are a stroke survivor, this could mean speaking to your doctor or social worker to get some answers. If you know a stroke survivor, reach out, ask them how they\u2019re feeling. No one should have to live their life in constant fear.\u201d\n\nFor more information and advice from the Stroke Association or call their helpline on 0303 3033 100.", "description": "Niall Woods, from south Belfast, was just 19 when he suffered a stroke that left him in a coma for six months", "authors": ["Maurice Fitzmaurice", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Irish Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20575049.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_niall-2JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
