We Are The Weather feels much more like a call to action. What led you to this more prescriptive stance?\n\nPart of it is the urgency of climate change, which is a collective problem. One could probably look at animal agriculture itself as a collective problem in the sense that it\u2019s a system that produces so much violence and destruction that we all need to work to dismantle it. But animal welfare doesn\u2019t have a ticking clock in quite the same way that climate change does. With climate change, we either fix it now or we will never fix it.\n\nOf all the efforts that people could make to help the climate, why focus on food?\n\nMost people think about animal agriculture or meat as something that they have a personal relationship with, whereas when we think about climate change, we think things like, \u201cSomeone\u2019s got to do something.\u201d We don\u2019t know exactly where the \u201cI\u201d fits into the problem or the solution. That was something I wanted to figure out for myself: What it is that you could do\u2014assuming that you\u2019re not a legislator?\n\nWe know that the four things an individual can do that really matter are having fewer kids, flying less, living car free, and eating a plant-based diet. Most people aren\u2019t currently in the process of deciding whether or not to have a kid, and 85 percent of Americans drive to work and live in cities designed to require a car. About half of all flights are either for work or for what are called non-leisure personal purposes, like going to visit a sick relative.\n\nFood, however, is a choice that we make three times a day. It\u2019s the only one of those four things that immediately addresses methane and nitrous oxide, which are the two most urgently important greenhouse gases. [Editor\u2019s note: Over the long-term, methane and nitrous oxide are 25 to 300 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.] So then I started to just think, what\u2019s possible for me? What is fair to ask of others? What\u2019s required?\n\nPeople have more control over the agriculture industry with their food choices than they do over, say, oil and gas wells. But our current agricultural system is still supported by the government with subsidies, anti-whistleblower laws, and more. How does individual action succeed in the face of that?\n\nThose laws aren\u2019t what\u2019s making it difficult for you or for me. They\u2019re making it very easy for that industry to carry on or to expand its destructive practices, but they\u2019re not forcing our hand. And we can force their hand. I\u2019ve met a lot of farmers in my life who said to me, \u201cI grow what people buy.\u201d A good example of this is cage-free and free-range eggs, which are the fastest growing sector in the food industry\u2014not because the industry had some sort of ethical revelation, not because they taste better, and not because they\u2019re any healthier for us. It\u2019s because people said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to support that.\u201d And it worked. You could maybe find them in a health food store five years ago, and now you can find them in gas stations. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s at all na\u00efve to believe that consumer preferences will reform the industry. We\u2019re watching it happen in front of our eyes right now.\n\nYou\u2019re candid about your own struggles eliminating meat, and at times it seems like in We Are The Weather that you\u2019re still trying to convince yourself. You write that you\u2019re trying to stop eating eggs and cheese by the end of book. Did you succeed?\n\nI have been succeeding, not perfectly, but a lot more perfectly than before. I would be lying if I said that it\u2019s easy. It\u2019s not easy, but that\u2019s okay. Rather than feeling like a hypocritical failure when I fall short of my own intentions or values, I kind of enjoy the work of it. I like the feeling of digging in, and doing my best. For me, I\u2019ve come to realize that this is not going to be a decision that I make once. It\u2019s going to be a conversation that I have with myself at most meals, when I\u2019m at the supermarket or a restaurant, where I just pause and say, \u201cYou want this. You also want that. How do we weigh those two wants?\u201d Sometimes the want that is not good for the environment wins\u2014and should win. If you have a relative who is sick, I think it\u2019s the right thing to get on a plane and visit them.\n\nYou write about a friend of yours who refuses to read your books because he knows he won\u2019t like the knowledge they will provide. So given how fraught an issue food choice is, are you optimistic?\n\nMy impression is that at the moment of our speaking, which is not the same as a year ago even, pretty much everyone knows what needs to be done and wants to do it. There are twice as many people in America who believe in Bigfoot as deny climate change right now. It\u2019s hard to find people, putting aside our president, who deny the basic science and the basic realities of it, and most people want to participate in the solution. So what\u2019s needed is not some kind of philosophical or ethical revolution, but connecting the values that we have and share with our behaviors. And I think a large part of that is just about how we talk about it, to each other and to ourselves.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.", "description": "The writer\u2019s second book on animal agriculture asks readers to take a hard look at their own role in the climate crisis.", "authors": ["Kate Wheeling"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/71a8c60d921481f23b1a01e22d3dab2162b37956.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
