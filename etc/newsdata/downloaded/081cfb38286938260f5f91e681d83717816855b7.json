The name comes from the 1950s, when the Chinese Communist Party confiscated property from landowners, often violently, in the name of the masses. As many as two million people were killed.\n\nChina\u2019s state-controlled media is playing a new game of \u201cFight the Landlord,\u201d and its target is one of the biggest landlords in the world: the 91-year-old Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing. Hong Kong\u2019s summer of protests stems mainly from sky-high housing costs, China\u2019s media argues, and Mr. Li and other local real estate tycoons should be held responsible.\n\n\u201cIn the current chaotic situation in Hong Kong, many young people are venting their dissatisfaction with high housing prices and expensive rents at the government,\u201d wrote an official commentary by the party\u2019s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, which oversees China\u2019s police and courts. \u201cThey\u2019re probably blaming the wrong target.\u201d\n\nThe return of \u201cFight the Landlord\u201d lays bare the Communist Party\u2019s shifting attitudes toward the business world. Hong Kong\u2019s property tycoons were once big beneficiaries of an unspoken pact between Beijing and business: They could wheel and deal as they liked, so long as they helped China achieve its economic dreams and left the politics to the Communist Party.", "description": "State media puts pressure on Li Ka-shing, a powerful property tycoon, showing the Communist Party\u2019s view of business as a means of control.", "authors": ["Li Yuan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/business/00newworld1/00newworld1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
