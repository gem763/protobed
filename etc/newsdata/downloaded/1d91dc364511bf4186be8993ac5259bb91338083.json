After being overweight on stocks for years, she decided the fallout from the ongoing trade tensions was too risky.\n\n\"We are long-term investors. So, we reduced risk back in May when it became clear we were further away from a deal than we had originally thought,\" said Shue.\n\nShe's now overweight cash and diligently searching for opportunities within sectors that could benefit from the government's protectionist policies. Some examples include defense contractors and software.\n\nWhether there's a deal or not, Shue expects the market's wild swings will continue for months.\n\n\"There are sure to be more ups and downs along the way,\" Shue said.\n\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq closed up almost 2% for the week while the Dow was 1.5% higher. The three indexes are up between 4% and 6% over the past three months despite the market's disappointing August.\n\nDisclaimer", "description": "Wilmington Trust's Meghan Shue is concerned market volatility is leading investors down the wrong path.", "authors": ["Stephanie Landsman"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106065658-1565265949403preview.jpg?v=1565266013", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
