The first trailer for Richard Jewell shows the director working in the same \u201cbased on a true story\u201d vein as Sully and American Sniper, the latter of which earned $350 million in 2015 along with a nomination for Best Picture. And, like those movies, reflects Eastwood\u2019s particular political leanings in the way it takes the side of the individual against political bureaucracy and the mass media. (Watch the trailer above.)\n\nWritten by Billy Ray, the film dramatizes the experiences of the titular security guard, who was on duty in Atlanta\u2019s Centennial Park on the night of July 27, 1996, when a domestic terrorist bombing interrupted the Summer Olympics. Jewell was initially hailed as a hero for spotting the bomb before it detonated, giving officials precious time to evacuate the grounds, saving hundreds of lives in the process. In the days following the bombing, though, both the FBI and the media came to view him as a potential suspect, upending his personal and private life. While he was eventually exonerated after Eric Rudolph was identified as the bomber, Jewell spent the rest of his life correcting the public record in court. (Jewell died in 2007; Rudolph is serving four consecutive life sentences in a Colorado prison.)\n\nThe trailer makes it very clear where Eastwood stands on the question of who the guilty parties in this story are. \u201cHis accusers are two of the most powerful forces in the world,\u201d says Sam Rockwell, who plays Watson Bryant \u2014 a fictionalized version of Jewell\u2019s real-life attorney, L. Lin Wood. \u201cThe United States government and the media.\u201d The government is represented in the film by Jon Hamm\u2019s federal agent Tom Shaw, who has his eye on Jewell (played by Paul Walter Hauser) right away. \u201cYou always look at the guy who found the bomb, just like you always look at the guy who found the body,\u201d Shaw intones gravely. And he tries to make his case against Jewell stick by interrogating him without a lawyer present, asking him to repeat the same warning delivered by the bomber, all the while insisting that it may be the only way he can clear his name.\n\nMeanwhile, Olivia Wilde stands in for the media as reporter Kathy Scruggs, an Atlanta journalist who also believes in Jewell\u2019s guilt. \u201cJewell fits the profile of the lone bomber,\u201d she remarks. \u201cA frustrated white man who is a police wanna-be who seeks to become a hero.\u201d That attitude doesn\u2019t sit well with Bryant, who tells Scruggs, \u201cYou\u2019ve ruined this man\u2019s life!\u201d\n\nThe trailer\u2019s pronounced sense of aggrievement towards the media and the FBI certainly sound familiar to anyone who has been following real-world headlines \u2014 or, for that matter, certain Tweets coming from the White House. Not surprisingly, the movie\u2019s political stance is already becoming a subject of debate on social media, with many noting Eastwood\u2019s choice of timing to tell this story.\n\nI know you all love some Clint, but the moment Olivia Wilde's cartoonishly eeeeeevil journalist sneered \"I REPORT THE FACTS!!!\" in that RICHARD JEWELL trailer, I checked out \u2014 Chris EvangelistAHHH!!!

He's actually the GOP's most effective propagandist; only took him 6 months to make a movie about the media and FBI teaming up to wrongfully smear an overweight patriot. https://t.co/N3AUyLidB3 \u2014 Jon F.
