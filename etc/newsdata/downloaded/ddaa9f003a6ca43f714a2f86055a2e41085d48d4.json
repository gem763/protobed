And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits.\"\n\nDraghi rejected the accusation, saying eurozone policymakers \"stick with the G20 consensus and will never pursue competitive devaluation.\"\n\nTrump wasn't the only skeptic. German conservative MEP Markus Ferber said: \u201cDraghi is almost out of office and should have abstained from taking any long-term policy decisions that will commit the course of monetary policy in the eurozone for the long run.\"\n\nFerber argued the ECB's policies have benefited \"periphery\" countries facing issues that need to be tackled politically and not through monetary policy. \"To up the dosage of an ineffective medicine has hardly ever proven to be a sensible therapy,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Draghi was defiant, saying the package is a \"powerful one both in the short and long term\" to address economic risks. He also urged national capitals to take action on fiscal policy to go along with the ECB's measures.\n\n\"Governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner,\" he said, likely referring to Germany.\n\nUnsurprisingly, before the decision, Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann rejected the suggestion the current eurozone economic situation warranted such a stimulus push, which includes further cutting already-negative deposit rates and restarting unconventional monetary policies to pump money into markets through bond purchases. Weidmann, who is known for his hawkish stance, was backed by the governor of the Bank of France, Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau.\n\nDraghi said the measures \u2014 including a tiering system to exclude certain banks' excess deposits from negative rates while also envisaging an additional series of cheap loans for banks (known as targeted longer-term refinancing operations) \u2014 would benefit lenders. While cheap money tends to benefit Southern European banks, the tiering system will support Northern ones that have bigger levels of excess deposits.\n\nBank shares across Europe rose after the announcement.\n\nYet the ECB has no magic wand. \u201cIt remains doubtful that this will do much to reboot the eurozone economy let alone achieve the near 2 percent inflation target,\u201d said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.\n\nDespite Draghi's big push on Thursday, the ECB is being cautious about the outlook for the eurozone: It has even changed the wording on its policy timeline.\n\nIt used to say that interest rates would not rise until mid-2020. But the date has been removed: \u201cThe governing council now expects interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 percent within its projection horizon.\u201d\n\nThe change indicates that reaching the eurozone's inflation target will take an indefinite amount of time and the new measures will tie policymakers' hands for the foreseeable future.\n\nOver to you, Christine Lagarde.", "description": "The European Central Bank unveiled new stimulus measures to support the bloc\u2019s slowing economy.", "authors": ["Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli", "Paul Dallison", "Bjarke Smith-Meyer", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1174174930-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
