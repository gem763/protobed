After the Brexit vote, he \"found it difficult to reconcile with the political events happening around him. He became increasingly worried about racial incidents.\" The man also said he \"felt ashamed to be British ... I am in a constituency that reflects an opinion that is not for me.\"\n\n\"Political events can act as major psychological stressors and have a significant impact on the mental health of people, especially those with a predisposition to develop mental illness,\" Dr. Haq says.\n\nThe report does state however, that the man had experienced a similar episode 13 years previously after major work-related stress. He was also experiencing work and family-related stress before the \"Brexit psychosis\" episode, \"which could potentially have been a contributory factor.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Haq, the patient recovered in two weeks after being treated with olanzapine, an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.", "description": "Symptoms included \u2018auditory hallucinations\u2019 and \u2018bizarre delusions.\u2019", "authors": ["Louise Guillot"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178023773-1200x628.jpg"}
