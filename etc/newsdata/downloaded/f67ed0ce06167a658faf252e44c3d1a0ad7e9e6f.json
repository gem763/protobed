Last Sunday, organizers estimated that 1.7 million people \u2014 or nearly a quarter of Hong Kong\u2019s total population \u2014 marched through pouring rain to demonstrate their continuing support for the territory\u2019s autonomy and to demand greater freedom. Authorities in Beijing responded with more hints of armed intervention, even as militarized police forces conspicuously drilled in the neighboring city of Shenzhen.\n\nThe threat of a mainland invasion might be bluffing by the regime of Chinese President Xi Jinping, which surely realizes that it would incur huge economic costs and shred its pretensions to global leadership. Nevertheless, it must be taken as a real possibility by Western democracies, which supported the territory\u2019s return to Chinese sovereignty two decades ago on the basis of Beijing\u2019s guarantee that its independent legal system and rights of free speech and assembly would be maintained for 50 years.\n\nThis weekend\u2019s summit of the Group of Seven industrial democracies offers an opportunity for those governments, including the United States, to send Mr. Xi a clear message: If he chooses to crush Hong Kong\u2019s democracy movement, there will be far-reaching consequences for China\u2019s political and economic relations with the West. The G-7 leaders should make clear that they will not hesitate to adopt punishing sanctions, including the immediate revocation of Hong Kong\u2019s special economic status, which facilitates flows of trade and investment to the mainland.\n\nSuch a declaration is needed because, until now, the West\u2019s response to the Hong Kong crisis has been weak. Official statements, such as one issued last week by the European Union and Canada and another by the State Department, have mostly stuck to generic diplomatic calls for \u201crestraint\u201d and \u201cdeescalation\u201d and \u201cdialogue.\u201d While supporting Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cfundamental freedoms,\u201d neither the E.U.-Canada statement nor the State Department\u2019s explicitly backed the mass protest movement or its entirely reasonable demands.\n\nWorst of all has been the performance of President Trump, who has repeatedly made statements siding with Mr. Xi. In July, he declared that the Communist ruler had handled the protests \u201cvery responsibly\u201d because \u201che has allowed that to go on for a long time.\u201d A couple of weeks later, he called the demonstrations \u201criots\u201d and mused that China might \u201cwant to stop that\u201d before flashing a green light: \u201cBut that\u2019s between Hong Kong and that\u2019s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China.\u201d\n\nLast week, stung by criticism of this blatant abdication, Mr. Trump bemoaned that \u201cmany are blaming me\u201d before weakly expressing his \u201chope it works out for everybody.\u201d He later claimed, ludicrously, that Mr. Xi could end the crisis in 15 minutes if he negotiated with the protesters. Last Sunday, Mr. Trump finally said it would be \u201cvery hard\u201d to conclude a U.S.-China trade deal if there were a crackdown in Hong Kong, but he disassociated himself from such a response: \u201cI\u2019m the president, but that\u2019s a little beyond me because . . . I think there would be tremendous political sentiment not to do something.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s stance may encourage Mr. Xi to believe he will pay little price in the West if he orders a crackdown. That\u2019s why G-7 leaders ought to prevail on the U.S. president this weekend to join them in dispelling that impression. They cannot directly defend Hong Kong or its people if China elects to use force. But they can do far more than they have so far to deter Mr. Xi.", "description": "They can do far more than they have so far to deter Xi Jinping.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2b9Hapw8vbdnf-HtN99Hg2CXcPw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P5EI3WWE7QI6TGMGD6Z6IOL34Q.jpg"}
