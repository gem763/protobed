On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nWith a six-year payment history and a 9.4% yield, many investors probably find Group intriguing. We'd agree the yield does look enticing. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nASX:PTB Historical Dividend Yield, October 11th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 123% of Group's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A payout ratio above 100% is definitely an item of concern, unless there are some other circumstances that would justify it.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Group paid out 150% of its free cash last year. Cash flows can be lumpy, but this dividend was not well covered by cash flow. Paying out more than 100% of your free cash flow in dividends is generally not a long-term, sustainable state of affairs, so we think shareholders should watch this metric closely. Cash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Group's payouts were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would definitely be concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.\n\nIs Group's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Group's dividend was not well covered by earnings, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). With net debt of 1.02 times its EBITDA, Group has an acceptable level of debt.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. Net interest cover of 6.55 times its interest expense appears reasonable for Group, although we're conscious that even high interest cover doesn't make a company bulletproof.\n\nWe update our data on Group every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. Group has been paying a dividend for the past six years. Although it has been paying a dividend for several years now, the dividend has been cut at least once by more than 20%, and we're cautious about the consistency of its dividend across a full economic cycle. During the past six-year period, the first annual payment was AU$0.051 in 2013, compared to AU$0.07 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 5.4% per year over this time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like PTB Group Limited (ASX:PTB) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason - some...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IT3BDM1nV5Ssd2WfWRJSsA--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/60b70f0286f543ba7ace2c5bf08b459a", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
