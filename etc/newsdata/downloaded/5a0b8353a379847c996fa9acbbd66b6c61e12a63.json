I\u2019ve just received the advance copies of my new book about Philip Larkin, called Somewhere Becoming Rain. Holding it up to be observed at various angles, I gloat audibly. On a less self-involved note, I\u2019ve just read Anne Applebaum\u2019s Red Famine. Her clarity reminds me of Olivia Manning.\n\nThe book that changed my life\n\nLucky Jim by Kingsley Amis. I can still quote whole scenes from it. I read it in my early 20s, still a bit young to have fully understood that a book can be simultaneously entertaining and serious. Abruptly I realised that it could be a possible aim, for a writer, to raise a serious point and a laugh along with it.\n\nThe book I wish I\u2019d written\n\nI won\u2019t say that I wish I\u2019d written Larkin\u2019s poems because I remain endlessly glad that he did.\n\nThe book that had the greatest influence on my writing\n\nSJ Perelman\u2019s Westward Ha! I loved the sublime mixture of high style and low content and I thought: yeah, both those doors at once.\n\nThe book I think is most under/overrated\n\nThere are paragraphs by Raymond Chandler that are underrated. But it\u2019s an open question whether he wrote any underrated novels. The most overrated books almost all emerged simultaneously from a single genre: magic realism. I can\u2019t stand it. I always found ordinary realism quite magic enough.\n\nThe book that changed my mind\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw, his preface to Saint Joan. Reading that wonderful stretch of prose started me on the road to a more human version of Christianity: a road I like to think that I am still pursuing.\n\nThe last book that made me cry\n\nIt was 20 minutes ago when I was reading Larkin\u2019s poem \u201cTo the Sea\u201d. Sometimes I could swear his memories were mine. Although Australia and Britain have very different beaches, when he was near the sea he always thought it was his element.\n\nThe last book that made me laugh\n\nWhen Philip Roth died I started reading Portnoy\u2019s Complaint again, looking for a quotable line, and couldn\u2019t find one that wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe book I couldn\u2019t finish\n\nI very rarely give up on a book that I\u2019ve really started. Closing a book in disgust half way through the first paragraph doesn\u2019t count.\n\nThe book I\u2019m most ashamed not to have read\n\nThat means nothing. I\u2019ve read all the books I thought ought to be read. The books I haven\u2019t read are the books I thought didn\u2019t need to be read.\n\nMy earliest reading memory\n\nReading to myself, it was a Biggles book by WE Johns, but I can\u2019t remember which one. Biggles Flies East? Biggles Flies West? Biggles Flies West was much better, incidentally. Long before that my mother used to read me The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m on the back verandah of our house in Kogarah. She had a natural sense of rhythm, which became a model for the rest of my life as a performer.\n\nMy comfort read\n\nThat\u2019s not a concept that I\u2019m familiar with. If reading didn\u2019t make me uncomfortable in one way or another, it would just send me to sleep. I get comfort in other ways. I once wrote a poem called \u201cThe Book of My Enemy Has Been Remaindered\u201d. I\u2019m afraid I still get a big bang out of seeing the books of my rivals being utterly ignored.\n\nThe book I give as a gift\n\nLarkin again: The Whitsun Weddings.\n\nThe book I\u2019d most like to be remembered for\n\nSince by definition the world will have to still be here in order for anyone to remember my book Cultural Amnesia, then that\u2019s the one. EP Thompson talked about history rescuing the past from the \u201cenormous condescension of posterity\u201d. Condescension towards the past has never been more enormous than it is now. My book not only says that we have to remember the past, it presumes that we will, so there is hope in it as well as a warning.\n\n\u2022 Somewhere Becoming Rain by Clive James is published by Picador (\u00a312.99).
