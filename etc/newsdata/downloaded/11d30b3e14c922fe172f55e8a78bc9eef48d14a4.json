You can hear notifications and alerts, activate smart home or call a friend, \u2018all without pulling out your phone\u2019 -- similar to technology seen in the Netflix series 'Black Mirror'\n\nThe device costs just $180, but \u2018Ahmed\u2019 wrote \u2018don\u2019t be lulled, the $$ is in the data they collect from you\u2019\n\n\u2018That's where we're headed, and it obviously presents both huge data collection issues with respect to the wearer and privacy implications for what that tech will ultimately observe.'\n\nMany consumers flocked to Twitter following the release of Echo Frames to voice their fears about these \u2018data stealing\u2019 glasses.\n\n\u2018Terrifying spyware. It is deeply wrong to wear this crap. It infringes my liberty as well as your own,\u2019 wrote Twitter users Sam Jordison.\n\nThe device costs just $180, but \u2018Ahmed\u2019 wrote \u2018don\u2019t be lulled, the $$ is in the data they collect from you\u2019.\n\nUser \u2018razz\u2019 noted that \u2018doesn\u2019t get more personal than a pair of glasses on your face or more unexpected than a ring. Depending on what sensors each device has inside we can figure out what data is being collected by @Amazon to make up for those low prices\u2019.\n\nAnother users jokingly said these glasses are a part of a \u2018Stream your life to Amazon\u2019 episode.\n\nThe frames pair with the Alexa app and Amazon shared that the microphones can be disabled by double-pressing the action button on the side \u2013 as the firm wants to protect the privacy of its users\n\n\u2018Echo Frames are just another manifestation of Echo generally,\u2019 Jerome wrote.\n\n\u2018These devices aren't intended to listen to conversations; they're intended to listen to wake words and respond accordingly.\n\n\u2018Now, we've obviously seen stories of where that went wrong.\u2019\n\nOther users believe Amazon is intentionally selling Echo Frames at a low price\n\n\u2018At this point, voice assistants will make mistakes and can activate at the wrong time.\n\n\u2018That's part of the reason the tech companies were reviewing audio records to try to understand what could inadvertently set off Alexa.\n\n\u2018There's also motivation to collect audio data to better improve voice assistants, but that isn't the same thing as wanting to listen to conversations.\u2019\n\nSome Twitter users have made a joke about the privacy concerns surrounding Echo Frames\n\nMany are sure Amazon is using this device to gather their data\n\n\u2018I don't think consumers should be worried generally, but I also don't think folks should but smart assistants in their bedrooms.\u2019\n\n\u2018If the concern is that these devices will capture conversations or somehow help profile us with respect to our most sensitive activities, then it just strikes me that bedrooms are an especially intimate area.\u2019\n\n\u2018It isn't that people shouldn't, but if we're really concerned about Orwellian surveillance, where we put these devices in our homes matters.\u2019", "description": "Amazon Echo Frames are designed with tiny microphones to allow hands-free access to Alexa, but consumers fear the personal assistant is listening in on their conversations.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/20/18979592-0-image-a-50_1569525220708.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
