Here are some of the most notable examples:\n\nZelensky credited Trump for his election victory in Ukraine:\n\n\"We did win big and we worked hard for [victory]. We worked a lot but I would like to confess to you that I had an opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for our elections and yes it is true that these were unique elections.\"\n\nHe said he copied Trump's agenda, and name-dropped his \"Drain the swamp\" slogan from the 2016 campaign:\n\n\"We are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our country. We brought in many many new people. Not the old politicians, not the typical politicians, because we want to have a new format and a new type of government. You are a great teacher for us and in that.\"\n\nZelensky name-dropped Trump Tower, and said that he stayed there:\n\n\"I would like to tell you that I also have quite a few Ukrainian friends that live in the United States. Actually last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower.\"\n\nHe said that Air Force One is \"probably much better\" than his plane:\n\n\"After that, it might be a very good idea for you to travel to Ukraine. We can either take my plane and go to Ukraine or we can take your plane, which is probably much better than mine.\"\n\nHere is the full account of the call (note that it is not a precise transcript):\n\nThe call also showed Trump flattering Zelensky, telling him that he has done a \"fantastic job\" and describing his electoral campaign, which he ran after working as a comedian, as a big victory.\n\n\"The way you came from behind, somebody who wasn't given much of a chance, and you ended up winning easily. It's a fantastic achievement. Congratulations,\" Trump said.\n\nRead more about the Ukraine scandal:\n\nTrump aides were so afraid he'd pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden that they tried to derail his call with the Ukrainian president\n\nNancy Pelosi said there's one key reason why she finally moved forward on impeachment", "description": "A July phone call between Trump and Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky is now at the center of an impeachment inquiry against Trump.", "authors": ["Sin\u00e9ad Baker"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8b79312e22af317f7b16b7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
