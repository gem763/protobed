The Benn Act required him to send a letter to the president of the European Council seeking an extension, and that's what he's done. The act doesn't require that he sign the letter,\" Pannick said, referring to law asking him to request a delay.\n\n\"The Benn act has achieved its purpose. The act doesn't require the prime minister to abandon his political objectives, his political beliefs, that we should leave on the 31st.\"\n\nPannick said he had assisted lawmaker Oliver Letwin in drafting the amendment which derailed Johnson's plans for a vote on his Brexit deal on Saturday.\n\nThe amendment said that lawmakers would withhold approval for Brexit until legislation to deliver Brexit was in place, meaning parliament had not approved a deal and that a extension had to be requested under the terms of the Benn Act.\n\nScotland's highest court will sit on Monday to consider whether Johnson has complied with the Benn Act. Anti-Brexit campaigners who brought the case said they wanted the court to delay its ruling to see how negotiations with the EU play out.
