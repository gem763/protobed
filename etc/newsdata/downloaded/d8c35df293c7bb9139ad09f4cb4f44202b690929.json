Part-time work has jumped up over the past year, but the rate of full-time job growth has also been solid.\"\n\nAs for the slower wage growth, Bernard said earnings were still up a solid 3.7 per cent from a year earlier, consistent with other recent wage indicators.\n\n\"We've been waiting for the tighter labour market to start showing up in Canadian paycheques \u2014 it could be finally happening now. The Bank of Canada will surely take note, when it's balancing its considerations of domestic and foreign economic conditions at its next meeting in October.\"\n\nIn a statement responding to the job numbers, Brian DePratto, senior economist with TD Economics, said \"it is hard not to like today's report. Even the unchanged unemployment rate has a positive tone to it, coming from a rising labour force.\n\n\"Stepping back from the monthly swings, the trend remains healthy \u2014 a 30,000 average pace of hiring over the last six months is healthy by any measure.\"\n\nNoting Canadian job growth outpaced that of the U.S. this month, Derek Holt, Scotiabank's head of capital markets economics, said in an email that Canada is on track to create about 450,000 new jobs this year.\n\nEmployment up in 5 provinces\n\nOntario saw the biggest gains, with 58,000 new positions, led by the wholesale and retail sectors. Quebec added 20,000 jobs across a wide range of industries.\n\nManitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick also saw increased jobs.\n\nWhile the employment rate held steady in most provinces, British Columbia and Nova Scotia both saw unemployment rise 0.5 per cent as more people looked for work.\n\nThe new jobs in August included a boost of 94,300 jobs in the private sector and 73,300 new positions in services industries, the agency said in its latest labour force survey. Job creation in services was concentrated in areas such as finance, insurance, real estate, retail and education.\n\nThe report says 57,200 of the new jobs were part time and 42,000 of the positions were held by young workers aged 15 to 24, almost all of whom were women. The number of summer students, who planned to return to school after working between May and August, rose five per cent compared to 2018.\n\nWith files from CBC", "description": "Canada's economy posted a job surge last month of 81,100 net new positions, the bulk of them part time, in the services sector and picked up by young people.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5273088.1567780220!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/atla-earls-tipping-20160712.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
