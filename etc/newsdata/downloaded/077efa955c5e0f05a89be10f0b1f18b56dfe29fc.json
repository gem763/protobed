Adam Best took it upon himself to explain why it was AOK for him and other jagoffs on the Left to attack, torment, harass, threaten, and even attempt to destroy the lives of the Covington High School kids. You know, since many on the Right are questioning the Left for using a teenager like Greta Thunberg to hide behind as some sort of climate change shield \u2026\n\nThe Right is full of such meanies, being concerned about her well-being and stuff.\n\nConservatives are referencing the Covington students to defend attacks on Greta Thunberg. They went to protest against women\u2019s rights wearing MAGA hats & mocked indigenous people by doing tomahawk chops. She spoke to the UN about climate change. These two things are not the same. \u2014 Adam Best (@adamcbest) September 24, 2019\n\nWe\u2019re not seeing anyone \u2018attacking\u2019 Greta.\n\nThe \u2018meanest\u2019 thing we\u2019re seeing is people pushing back on her ideas but attacks? Something like an adult talking about punching her in the face? Joking about dumping her in a wood chipper? You know, like the Left did with the Covington kids?\n\nNope.\n\nActually the only attacks we are seeing is a bunch of people angry at her parents for allowing their child to be exploited and used.\n\nAdam continued \u2026\n\nThe report by the firm that investigated the Lincoln Memorial confrontation found that Covington students did in fact use the tomahawk chop to mock Nathan Phillips and other Native Americans. Conservatives love to push the narrative that it was all a media invention. It wasn\u2019t. pic.twitter.com/C16XipMk9P \u2014 Adam Best (@adamcbest) September 24, 2019\n\nClueless.\n\nAnd wrong.\n\nYeah, this was all debunked. But do keep lying, because your simple minded followers can't remember anything beyond the last news cycle. \u2014 Ordy's Amish School of Coding (@OrdyPackard) September 24, 2019\n\nAnd debunked.\n\nAdam, if the only way you can make a point is to lie, presumably to justify the hatred that leftists heaped upon the Covington Catholic kids, then you really have no point at all. Best to sit this one out. https://t.co/1SCUcuQXSH \u2014 Ian McKelvey (@ian_mckelvey) September 24, 2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay when we do it.\u201d pic.twitter.com/GDeePjDiWo \u2014 Ian McKelvey (@ian_mckelvey) September 24, 2019\n\nHis last name is freakin\u2019 ironic, yes?\n\nSo, basically, Adam is in favor of child exploitation as long as it for a cause he supports. https://t.co/Z0iBAu5NGg \u2014 G (@TCC_Grouchy) September 24, 2019\n\nBasically.\n\nLefties reupping the debunked Covington story. This is slightly less shameful than Democrat candidates rewriting the Michael Brown story. Only slightly. https://t.co/2Y7XBAas47 \u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) September 24, 2019\n\n\u201cKids are only useful for political purposes and exempt from all criticism when they express views I agree with. Otherwise they deserve what they get.\u201d https://t.co/F9syFnGer8 \u2014 J.R. Holmsted (@JHolmsted) September 24, 2019\n\nHA! Perfect.\n\nFirst, the racial slurs were debunked and secondly they were not protesting women\u2019s rights. They were there because they are pro-life.\n\nThe majority of respected conservatives on here have mentioned how shameful it is she is being used or discussing Asperger\u2019s. https://t.co/XoryH0VIxi \u2014 Jodi (@APLMom) September 24, 2019\n\nBut the Covington kids were wearing red HATS!\n\nWere they from Tallahassee? Because it matters. pic.twitter.com/PV04htjWLk \u2014 Cyber Pops part of a complete breakfast (@CyberWarPodcast) September 24, 2019\n\nHeh.\n\nThey did not mock that Indian man. You are a liar. \u2014 Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) September 24, 2019\n\nIndeed he is.\n\nALL LIES. Do your homework.\n\nThey were there on a field trip & were harassed. They approached no one. \u2014 Mike Loftus (@MikeLoftus_) September 24, 2019\n\nThis is a lie. https://t.co/iNiSwmJQIM \u2014 Jebulus Maximus (@ClapForJeb) September 24, 2019\n\nOops.\n\nyeah, nothing you mentioned actually happened so.. \u2014 imbrue001[\u26a1\ufe0f]\ud83e\udd85 (@imbrue001) September 24, 2019\n\nYour narrative is false.
