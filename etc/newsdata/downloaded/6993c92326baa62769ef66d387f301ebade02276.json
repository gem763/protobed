The number of internet users around the world is rapidly approaching 4.5 billion, and if current trends continue, we should see some impressive new milestones as we head into 2020.\n\nI\u2019m particularly pleased to note that much of the growth in the ITU\u2019s new data has come from emerging economies \u2013 especially across Africa \u2013 and this could signal the start of a whole new wave of growth across all kinds of connected behaviors in the coming months.\n\nSocial media user numbers up again\n\nGlobal social media user numbers have surged this quarter too, but once again this is mainly due to the availability of new data, and not because of a sudden rush of new users.\n\nThe key driver in this quarter\u2019s growth comes from India, where WhatsApp recently revealed that they have passed the 400 million active user mark. For context, that\u2019s 100 million active users more than Facebook\u2019s core platform.\n\nThese figures suggest that almost 30 percent of India\u2019s total population already uses WhatsApp each month. What\u2019s more, with the number of mobile internet subscribers in India growing at a rate of more than 250,000 every day, there\u2019s still plenty more opportunity for social media growth in India.\n\nOther platforms belonging to Facebook Inc. and Tencent also contributed to overall growth in social media user numbers, but \u2013 as we\u2019ll see below \u2013 there are some interesting trends emerging at the individual platform level.\n\nFacebook\u2019s ad audience growth slows\n\nFacebook\u2019s core product saw significantly slower growth in its advertising audience numbers over the past three months, with the platform adding just 8 million new users between July and September 2019. At just 0.4 percent, this quarterly growth rate is significantly lower than the 3 percent growth in advertising audience numbers that the platform delivered in the second quarter of this year.\n\nMeanwhile, individual country figures tell an even more interesting story. Facebook\u2019s own advertising tools suggest that advertisers can reach fewer people in the United States and Indonesia today compared to this time three months ago, suggesting that advertising audiences in two of the platform\u2019s biggest markets may actually be shrinking, albeit only by small margins.\n\nMeanwhile, despite the fact that Facebook still appears to have the largest youth audience of any social media platform in the world, the company\u2019s latest numbers suggest that its youth advertising audience is also shrinking. Facebook\u2019s advertising tools indicate that advertisers can now reach 2.6 percent fewer users aged 13 to 17 compared to the second quarter of 2019, and 2 percent fewer users aged 18 to 24.\n\nHowever, there may be various reasons for these drops, including proactive moves by Facebook to remove accounts that have breached the platform\u2019s terms and conditions. These numbers are also only representative of the platform\u2019s advertising audiences, and may not correlate to changes in the platform\u2019s total monthly active users [note: the figures that Facebook reports in its investor earnings reports are monthly active user numbers, and not the advertising audience numbers that we report here].\n\nIt\u2019s also worth highlighting that Facebook delivered improved advertising performance during the third quarter compared to the previous three months. The platform\u2019s Audience Insights tool reveals that the typical global Facebook user clicked on a median of 12 adverts per month between July and September 2019, compared to a median of 11 adverts per month between April and June.\n\nTikTok don\u2019t stop\n\nBytedance hasn\u2019t published active user numbers for TikTok in recent months, focusing instead on sharing its latest app download numbers, or the combined number of active users across all of the apps in the company\u2019s broader portfolio. The company\u2019s new self-service advertising tools don\u2019t show audience numbers either, opting instead to report audience reach on a five-point scale.\n\nHowever, the latest data from app intelligence company App Annie suggest that TikTok continues its explosive growth around the world, with the insights company ranking TikTok just behind Instagram in terms of monthly active users through the third quarter of 2019.\n\nApp Annie\u2019s latest data also suggest that TikTok\u2019s download rates may have increased in the past few weeks, with the global download rankings for September 2019 showing TikTok in second place, just behind Mario Kart Tour, and ahead of all of Facebook\u2019s platforms.\n\nPinterest\u2019s steady ascent\n\nPinterest\u2019s first investor earnings report revealed that the platform now has 300 million monthly active users around the world, representing annual growth of 30 percent versus Q2 2018. Data from the company\u2019s self-service advertising tools also show solid growth in advertising reach over the past three months, and marketers can now use Pinterest to target more than 150 million users across the globe.\n\nThe demographics of Pinterest\u2019s advertising audience are particularly interesting. You probably won\u2019t be surprised to hear that women account for a significant share of Pinterest\u2019s total audience, but you may be surprised to learn what this share means when we translate it into actual user numbers.\n\nFor example, in the United States, advertisers can now reach almost as many women over the age of 30 on Pinterest as they can on Instagram, despite Instagram\u2019s total global advertising audience (male and female) being almost six times bigger than Pinterest\u2019s.\n\nPinterest also performs well in Western Europe. The platform\u2019s advertising tools suggest that advertisers can now reach roughly 8.3 million women across all age groups in Germany, compared to the 9.9 million women that advertisers can reach on Instagram.\n\nThe situation in France is similar, with Pinterest reporting a female advertising audience of 8.1 million, compared to Instagram\u2019s female audience of 9.1 million, again across all age groups.\n\n5G making its mark\n\nThe latest internet connection speed data from Ookla indicate that the promise of 5G hasn\u2019t been exaggerated. Average mobile data speeds in South Korea \u2013 which arguably has seen the most extensive 5G rollout so far \u2013 have gone into overdrive in the past two quarters, and the numbers tell a compelling story for 5G\u2019s future.\n\nOokla reports that the average mobile internet connection in the country reached 95.11Mbps in September \u2013 almost 40 percent faster than the average mobile download speed in second-placed Qatar.\n\nHowever, Korea actually saw a slight drop in mobile download speeds in September, and if we look at mobile connection speeds across the third quarter of 2019 as a whole, the average Korean mobile internet connection actually exceeded 100Mbps. That\u2019s more than double the speeds that South Korea\u2019s mobile users enjoyed just this time last year.\n\nFor context, Netflix recommends that users need a minimum connection bandwidth of 25Mbps to stream \u201cUltra HD quality\u201d content (e.g. movies in 4K definition). That means that the average Korean mobile user can now stream four separate 4K movies on a single mobile internet connection at the same time.\n\nAt the risk of resurrecting one of digital\u2019s oldest clich\u00e9s, these trends suggest that 2020 may be \u201cthe year of 5G mobile.\u201d However, 5G\u2019s real promise doesn\u2019t lie in multi-streaming 4K movies to phones, but in powering the internet of things.\n\nThe impact of IoT devices may take a little longer to influence people\u2019s everyday lives, but now is still a good time to start preparing, because the future is accelerating.\n\nAsia rising\n\nApp Annie\u2019s latest data show that six of the world\u2019s ten most-used mobile apps are now owned by Chinese companies (side note: the remainder are all owned by Facebook). Chinese companies also dominate when it comes to mobile games, which App Annie reports account for 40 percent of all global app downloads.\n\nBut Asia\u2019s digital influence isn\u2019t limited to Chinese companies, and organizations in Japan and Korea consistently deliver some of the world\u2019s most popular apps too.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s a similar story when we look at the web. Asian sites increasingly dominate the world\u2019s most-visited online destinations, with China\u2019s ecommerce platforms showing particular success.\n\nHowever, the latest global web traffic insights from SimilarWeb reveal some more interesting trends. The company\u2019s ranking of the world\u2019s most visited websites for September 2019 show that Korea\u2019s naver.com and Japan\u2019s yahoo.co.jp have both entered the global top 20, although sadly there\u2019s nothing obvious in the data to suggest what may be behind the increasing appeal of either site.\n\nData from Amazon\u2019s insights division, Alexa (not to be confused with the company\u2019s voice assistant of the same name), tell a similar story. The company\u2019s latest reports show that Chinese websites now account for three of the five most-visited web destinations in the world, and more than half of the top 20.\n\nTmall performs particularly well in Alexa\u2019s latest rankings, with the company ranking three distinct domains in the world\u2019s top 20 websites. Critically, the ecommerce platform\u2019s homepage now ranks as the fourth most-visited website in the world \u2013 significantly higher than Amazon.com, which Alexa currently ranks thirteenth.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that an increasing number of shoppers may be making use of Amazon\u2019s mobile apps, but \u2013 once again \u2013 Chinese companies are winning in the mobile ecommerce world too, with Alibaba\u2019s Taobao app coming in at ninth place in App Annie\u2019s ranking of the world\u2019s most used mobile apps.\n\nWith the sheer size of Asia\u2019s population and the rapid growth of internet users across the region, these numbers and trends are easy to explain, but their implications cannot be overstated. As we head into the next decade, expect to see some significant shifts in the center of the internet\u2019s gravity.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to dig a bit deeper into ecommerce behaviors and trends in Asia, check out our recent deep-dive reports on online shopping across Southeast Asia.\n\nLooking ahead to 2020\n\nWe\u2019re already preparing for our flagship Digital 2020 reports, which I\u2019ll be publishing in the first few weeks of the new year.\n\nHowever, based on the emerging trends that we\u2019re already seeing in our preparations, here are three things I\u2019d recommend adding to your watchlist for 2020:\n\n1. Voice\n\nOne of the biggest changes in 2020 will be the rising use and influence of voice interfaces, and how these tools will shape the evolution of digital as a whole.\n\nFor clarity, the story here isn\u2019t just about the rise of smart speakers, and the opportunity certainly isn\u2019t limited to building an Echo Skill for your next ad campaign. Rather, voice interfaces have the potential to revolutionize the ways in which each and every one of us uses and interacts with all of our connected devices, with content, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 with search results.\n\n2. Games\n\nWhether it\u2019s playing them or watching others play them, and whether it\u2019s a quick five minutes at the bus stop or a global esports tournament, games will be another top story in 2020.\n\nThere are some huge opportunities for brands here, but marketing in these active, \u2018lean-forward\u2019 environments will require some very different thinking to the kind of \u2018lean-back\u2019 marketing that has dominated \u2018mass entertainment\u2019 advertising over the past 50 years.\n\n3. A cultural shift\n\nAs internet access and connection speeds accelerate across emerging markets, we can expect to see meaningful increases in the volume and popularity of content coming out of these geographies too.\n\nMany decry the dangers of today\u2019s internet \u2018filter bubbles\u2019, but \u2013 in reality \u2013 it has never been easier for individuals to connect with people from all over the world; to learn about their worlds and their cultures, and to explore valuable new perspectives and opportunities. So, my top tip for 2020 is to \u201cfeed your feed\u201d: actively add diverse perspectives and opinions into your digital diet, and embrace what diversity can do for you.\n\nThat\u2019s all for this quarter \u2013 I\u2019ll see you again in the next decade!\n\nThis post is part of our contributor series.
