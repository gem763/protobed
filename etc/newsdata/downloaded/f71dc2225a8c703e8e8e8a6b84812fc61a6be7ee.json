It is a great idea to see Afghan movies inside Afghanistan again.\"\n\nAfghan Film has also recently digitised hundreds of hours of footage that includes movies and documentaries of Afghanistan before it was ravaged by violence.\n\nKarimi, who has a doctorate in film, told AFP that the film board's staff must also take the lead in cinema's revival in Afghanistan.\n\n\"I told them that you don't need to stay in your office from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm, you should go outside, you should sit under trees, you should talk to each other about everything and generate ideas,\" she said.\n\nThe director, who opened a cafe in the building's courtyard so they would have a place to brainstorm, leads by example.\n\nHer film at Venice -- which has been endorsed by Angelina Jolie -- chronicles the lives of three Afghan women from various social backgrounds and the tough choices they face.\n\nBut many Afghans are still afraid the newfound freedoms people in cities like Kabul often enjoy could be taken away.\n\nTaliban and US negotiators were until recently on the brink of a deal that would have seen the US military cut its troop presence in return for various Taliban commitments.\n\nDespite a breakdown in talks, many Afghans are convinced the Taliban will come roaring back into power.\n\n\"They will come ... but we are not going to give up and we will fight,\" Karimi said.", "description": "In the dilapidated offices of Afghanistan's state-run film board, where old movie reels are stacked in rusting canisters, Sahraa Karimi heads the all-male team she hopes will help drag the nation's cinema from the lingering shadow of Taliban rule.  \"It is a very difficult position to be", "authors": ["Emal Haidary"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hOqDdwMGpiiX_.WrqZoS.Q--~B/aD01MTA7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/a792ffa2b3c112a1f5e0509e85fdb58afe80b208.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
