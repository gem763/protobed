Because police wouldn\u2019t believe her and she was arrested herself. But quitting was never an option.\n\nTanya*, now 29 years old, says the horror of that night seven years ago will forever be burnt into her memory \u2013 despite the SAPS paying her R125 000 in damages in 2015 for unlawful arrest.\n\n\u201cI was 22 when I was sexually assaulted and many people refused to believe me,\u201d she says.\n\nTanya had been at a friend\u2019s party in Alberton, southeast of Johannesburg, Gauteng.\n\n\u201cI was living in Durban [KwaZulu-Natal] at the time and came to visit a guy I liked in Joburg. I didn\u2019t know the other people at the party very well but back then I still trusted others easily,\u201d she tells YOU.\n\nTired after the day\u2019s long journey and after a few drinks, Tanya went to lie down in one of the spare rooms.\n\n\u201cI woke up at around 10pm. Someone was touching me and there was the flash of a camera,\u201d she recalls.\n\nREAD MORE: MY STORY: \u2018Marrying this man was the worst mistake of my life\u2019\n\nThe man was fondling her \u2013 when she woke up, she discovered he\u2019d pulled up her shirt and bras and her panties were around her ankles.\n\nShe says she was so scared she didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\u201cI froze. I didn\u2019t fight \u2013 I just pretended to still be sleeping. I\u2019d tried thinking what my options were but then there was a noise outside the room that frightened the man off,\u201d she says.\n\nThe only person Tanya knew at the party was the guy she liked. She asked another woman for help and spoke to her crush too but neither believed her. The man who\u2019d allegedly taken the pictures of her was their best friend.\n\n\u201cThey maintained he\u2019d never do something like that.\u201d\n\nShe called her dad, hundreds of kilometres away, and asked what she should do. All the partygoers were either too drunk to help her or simply didn\u2019t believe her.\n\n\u201cMy dad persuaded me to report the incident and I went to the nearest police station,\u201d she recalls.\n\nREAD MORE: 3 women are killed by their male partners in SA daily and we have the world\u2019s highest rate of rape \u2013 we need more than slogans and summits\n\nThere, her nightmare continued. She says she waited for hours for a police officer to take her statement.\n\n\u201cIt was hard to make a statement \u2013 of the five police officers, three were men. I felt ashamed to describe the specifics in front of them. I was tired and alone. The sun was starting to rise when they eventually took my statement.\u201d\n\nTanya says the police changed their attitude the moment they realised she hadn\u2019t been penetrated.\n\n\u201cI know I wasn\u2019t raped because I was having my period,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cBut he touched me and took [nude] pictures of me.\u201d\n\nTanya was given the chance to call her dad to tell him where she was before she was searched and put in a cell.\n\n\u201cThey put me in a cell with men and laughed at me \u2013 both the police and the men in the cell. At least they didn\u2019t leave me in there. It was more for their own amusement but I was horrified.\u201d\n\nShe was kept on her own in a cell, then handcuffed and taken to another police station. A full 36 hours passed before she could at last speak to a lawyer. She was taken to court the next afternoon on charges of perjury and making a false statement to police.\n\n\u201cThe holding cells at court are just as traumatic. One man pulled down his pants and grabbed his genitals as he walked past me . . . It just didn\u2019t stop,\u201d she says.\n\nThe magistrate threw the case out and ordered Tanya\u2019s immediate release. Tanya\u2019s lawyer, Johan Britz from GJB Attorneys, lodged a civil case against the SAPS and Tanya was eventually awarded R125 000 in damages.\n\n\u201cI wish I could say I felt better after winning the case but I didn\u2019t. I was never the same person after that night. I developed post-traumatic stress disorder and eventually had to be treated in a psychiatric clinic. For years afterwards I was still on anxiety medication and antidepressants. I had to pretend I was fine \u2013 but I wasn\u2019t,\u201d she says.\n\nREAD MORE: I hear my neighbour being abused - what is the best thing to do?\n\nTanya still has friends and family members who don\u2019t know the story and that\u2019s why she\u2019d rather tell it anonymously. The alleged perpetrator was never formally charged either.\n\n\u201cThankfully, there were people who stood by me and supported me. But I want to tell every woman, \u2018Know your rights and if they\u2019re violated, fight back\u2019.\u201d\n\nTanya says she believes those police officers hadn\u2019t been fully aware of what the law entails and it seemed they didn\u2019t think a crime had been committed because she hadn\u2019t been raped.\n\nJohan says he was shocked at the police officers\u2019 lack of empathy. \u201cThe support [she should\u2019ve got] that day was shockingly lacking. Though the sexual assault case never went anywhere, we at least got some justice for how she was treated afterwards.\u201d\n\n*Not her real name.\n\nEMERGENCY NUMBERS\n\n\u2022 People Opposed to Woman Abuse (Powa) offers counselling and legal assistance: 011-642-4345\n\n\u2022 Tears Foundation provides comprehensive support to victims of violence: *134*7355# or 010-590-5920\n\n\u2022 Gender-Based Violence Command Centre: 0800-428-428", "description": "The sexual assault that took place years ago still haunts her.
