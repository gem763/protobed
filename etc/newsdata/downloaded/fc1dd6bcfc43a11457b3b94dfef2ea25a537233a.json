We're thinking of you up there, we love you Grandad Ted.\"\n\nEarlier in Oita, May scored the first two of England's four tries in three first-half minutes as the Red Roses reached their first semi-final since 2007.\n\nKyle Sinckler and Anthony Watson crossed in the second half and 20 points flowed from Owen Farrell's perfect kicking as Jones's men throttled the Wallabies' attempts to claw their way back into it.\n\n\"We did what's needed. We had the lead and obviously Australia were throwing everything at us,\" said Farrell. \"We wanted to play the game at our pace not theirs, and we did that in the second half.\"\n\nWith his contract up after the World Cup, the defeat appears to have ended Michael Cheika's five-year stint as Wallabies coach whose highlight was reaching the World Cup final in 2015.\n\n\"I was supposed to get this done for the people here and the Australians. It's so disappointing,\" said a disconsolate Cheika, a former team-mate of Jones at Sydney's Randwick club.\n\nAustralia looked dangerous early on but England seized the advantage with May's rapid try double.\n\nEngland stretched the Australian defence as they attacked right and then left, before man of the match Tom Curry drew the final defender to give the left wing an easy score in the corner.\n\nHenry Slade then intercepted the ball on halfway and raced towards the try-line before chipping into space with a kick that was deftly gathered by the England wing.\n\nThree Christian Lealiifano penalties kept Australia in touch at 17-9 at half-time, and they came storming back after the restart when Marika Koroibete skinned Elliot Daly to cross for the Wallabies.\n\nBut England hit back almost immediately when Farrell picked out Sinckler with a bullet pass and the prop burst through a gap for his first international try.\n\nWatson's late intercept try completed the job for England, who equalled their record margin of victory against Australia - and beat them for a third time in the World Cup quarter-finals.", "description": "The All Blacks overwhelmed Ireland and England thumped their old enemy Australia to set up a blockbuster semi-final at the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9367/abbbe1a8b29c480ba357e943029bf112.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
