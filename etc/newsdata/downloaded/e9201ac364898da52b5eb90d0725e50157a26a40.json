Mark Milley \u201chas similarly been in communication with his counterpart\u201d in Turkey\u2019s military, Esper added. One of Milley\u2019s calls took place on Friday.\n\n\u201cThat remains our message: Stop, let\u2019s back to the status quo\u201d and rebuild the jointly patrolled safe zone along a 125-kilometer stretch of border that the Turks are now shelling, Esper said.\n\nThe calls come as Turkey continues to launch artillery and airstrikes across the border into a region of Syria that \u2014 until this week \u2014 was part of a \u201csafe zone\u201d patrolled jointly by U.S. and Turkish forces. President Donald Trump ordered the withdrawal of fewer than 50 U.S. troops manning two observation posts in the safe zone after a Sunday phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\u201cWe relocated a small contingent of less than 50 special operations soldiers out of the immediate zone of attack,\u201d Esper explained. He added that the overall U.S. troop level in Syria, which the Pentagon has put at 1,000, has not changed and U.S. troops remain partnered with the Syrian Kurdish forces in other parts of their territory. That\u2019s despite Trump\u2019s false claim on Thursday that \u201cwe have no soldiers in Syria.\u201d\n\nEsper and Milley gave little sign that they expected the calls to work. \u201cI just got off the phone just shortly ago with my counterpart, multiple calls over the last several days, and I\u2019m not seeing any indications or warnings of planned stoppage,\u201d Milley said. And in his calls with Akar, Esper said he had heard \u201cno indication yet that they are willing to stop.\u201d\n\nSo far, though, few Turkish ground troops have crossed the border into the 125-kilometer-long zone that the U.S. special operations teams evacuated, Milley said. The chairman put the numbers of Turkish light infantry troops that entered Syria \u201cin the hundreds\u201d along with \u201cmaybe up to a thousand\u201d Turkish-backed Syrian Arab proxy forces.\n\nArtillery, manned aircraft, drones and tanks are all firing across the border, Milley said, but \u201cthe incursion on the ground is relatively limited\u201d so far.\n\nThat means the Pentagon is still trying to head the Turks off before the point of no return. Esper\u2019s and Milley\u2019s calls appear to be Plan A.\n\nOnce Turkish ground troops cross the border in large numbers, the Pentagon\u2019s options will be much more limited, according to current and former military officers with recent experience in the region.\n\n\u201cCENTCOM is reeling. They\u2019re working around the clock but there\u2019s not a lot they can do,\u201d a former senior special operations officer who led troops in the region said of Central Command, the military headquarters responsible for the Middle East. \u201cThey\u2019re churning out courses of action to mitigate the effects of this, but with the [Turkish] offensive already underway, they\u2019re way behind the power curve.\u201d\n\nReferring to the possibility of using the U.S. military to protect the Syrian Kurds against the Turks, the same officer was pessimistic. \u201cAre you just going to use air support? The only way to really establish a safe zone is to have troops on the ground, and that\u2019s gone, that\u2019s a fait accompli,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. troops always have the right to defend themselves, Esper and Milley emphasized on Friday. But there is no authority \u201cthat I\u2019m aware of that allows us to conduct military operations in support of the Kurds against the Turks, a 70-year NATO ally,\u201d Milley said when asked whether U.S. aircraft would respond to requests from the Syrian Kurds for protection.\n\n\u201cI will not place American service members in the middle of a longstanding conflict between the Turks and the Kurds,\u201d Esper added. That \u201cis not why we are in Syria.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f1/ef/4c5ad1e047bb84f9f6647c60deaa/191011-mark-esper-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
