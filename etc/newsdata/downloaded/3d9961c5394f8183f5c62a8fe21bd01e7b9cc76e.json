A spokesman admits that there are various technical reasons \u2013 such as having to inform everyone who may be affected by the case, and requiring provision of the strata roll to do that \u2013 that can cause delays.\n\n\u201cIn relation to final hearing dates, the timeline can be extended because of parties\u2019 preparation of their case including exchanging evidence,\u201d the spokesman adds.\n\nSo it could take 10 weeks or more to get your case in front of a tribunal, then you have to wait for the verdict and gear up for an appeal if you think you\u2019ve been dudded.\n\nIn Victoria, the Civil and Administrative Tribunal\u2019s own website says that it generally takes eight weeks to a final hearing, but that doesn\u2019t take into account the initial complaint process or the time it takes for a verdict or for any subsequent appeals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Queensland, a convoluted two-tier, multi-level process leads ultimately to busy magistrates\u2019 courts rather than tribunals. Other states have different outcomes.\n\nThere is a simple solution to all this. If Fair Trading in NSW, Consumer Advice in Victoria and their equivalents elsewhere sent out strongly worded messages that there were potentially serious consequences to bad behaviour, many previously thoughtless residents might pull in their heads.\n\nAnd what if there were a \u201ccop it sweet or cop it hard\u201d approach, such as used by sporting codes, where unsuccessfully challenging a penalty leads to higher fines and bans?\n\nThat might focus miscreants\u2019 attention better than the prospect of meandering through a system that, thanks to delays, sometimes causes more problems than it solves.\n\nJimmy Thomson edits the strata living advice website flat-chat.com.au and produces the Flat Chat Wrap podcast.
