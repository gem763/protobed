They know that and it will be one of the challenges for them.\"\n\nTurning to Kolisi, Erasmus said: \"He played a full 80 minutes (against Italy) and was wonderful. I think it was his best game since he has been back from injury.\n\n\"The plan was always just to get him to the World Cup, to make sure the knee holds up.\n\n\"After that, we wanted to get him to play a full 80 minutes. He can do that now and his form is back to where it was, so to take him off the pitch would be like starting the process all over again. The more game-time he gets the better.\"\n\nDamian Willemse will start at fullback for the Springboks just days after arriving as an injury replacement for Jesse Kriel.\n\nNew Zealand top Pool B with 14 points from three games, while South Africa and Italy have 10 each.\n\nBoth Canada and Namibia have yet to claim a point.\n\nCanada have made six changes to the side overwhelmed by the All Blacks, including a brand new front row that sees props Hubert Buydens and Jake Ilnicki packing down either side of hooker Andrew Quattrin.\n\nKyle Baillie comes into the second row, with Andrew Coe starting at fullback and Phil Mack at scrum-half.\n\nVeteran wing DTH van der Merwe will make a Canadian record 15th World Cup appearance when he faces his native South Africa for the first time in 15-a-side rugby.\n\nAnd the Tier 2 nation is well aware of what it is up against.\n\n\"For any Tier 1 nation, playing the All Blacks and the Springboks in one week is a challenge,\" said Canada assistant coach Huw Wiltshire.\n\n\"We are hugely respectful of the South African team. They and the All Blacks are probably the two best sides at the minute in the tournament,\" he added.\n\n\"Two things you can't defend against in rugby are speed and power, and both those countries have got it across their teams, across the park and across their whole squads.\"\n\nThe two previous meetings between Canada and South Africa include their infamous 1995 World Cup clash that became known as the 'Battle of Boet Erasmus'.\n\nCanada's Gareth Rees and Rod Snow, as well as South Africa's James Dalton, were sent off following a mass brawl before the Springboks won 20-0 on the way to lifting the Webb Ellis Cup.\n\nKick-off is at 12:15 (SA time) on Tuesday.\n\nTeams:\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Damian Willemse, 14 Warrick Gelant, 13 Damian de Allende, 12 Frans Steyn, 11 Sbu Nkosi, 10 Elton Jantjies, 9 Cobus Reinach, 8 Francois Louw, 7 Kwagga Smith, 6 Siya Kolisi, 5 Franco Mostert, 4 RG Snyman, 3 Vincent Koch, 2 Schalk Brits, 1 Thomas du Toit\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Frans Malherbe, 19 Eben Etzebeth, 20 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 21 Herschel Jantjies, 22 Handre Pollard, 23 Willie le Roux\n\nCanada\n\n15 Andrew Coe; 14 Jeff Hassler, 13 Conor Trainor, 12 Ciaran Hearn, 11 DTH van der Merwe; 10 Peter Nelson, 9 Phil Mack; 8 Tyler Ardron (captain), 7 Matt Heaton, 6 Lucas Rumball; 5 Kyle Baillie, 4 Evan Olmstead; 3 Jake Ilnicki, 2 Andrew Quattrin, 1 Hubert Buydens\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Benoit Piffero, 17 Djustice Sears-Duru, 18 Matt Tierney, 19 Josh Larsen, 20 Michael Sheppard, 21 Jamie Mackenzie, 22 Shane O'Leary, 23 Guiseppe du Toit", "description": "South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus wants no let-up from his side as they look to book their place in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals against minnows Canada.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9439/d3e1278cb43c44d991bc08268b9ee82d.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
