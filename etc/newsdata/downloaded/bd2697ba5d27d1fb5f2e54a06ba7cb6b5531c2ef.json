It found significant lapses by the French authorities in alerting the public to health risks, even as their understanding of the danger became clearer.\n\nThe April 15 blaze nearly destroyed the 850-year-old cathedral and brought immediate scrutiny onto whether adequate fire protections had been in place to safeguard a gem of Gothic architecture visited by some 13 million people a year.\n\nMillions around the world watched in horror as the cathedral\u2019s roof and spire succumbed to the flames that night and collapsed. But the billowing smoke carried its own hidden danger: massive quantities of lead, according to test results in confidential reports and others released by the government.\n\nAs fire raged and the roof collapsed, some of the lead covering the roof and spire was dispersed as dust. Levels of lead dust deposited near the cathedral were up to 1,300 times higher than French safety guidelines. The lead spread across central Paris, tests indicate, settling in schools, parks and other public places. Here are all the places where lead was found above the guideline level of 93 micrograms per square foot cited by some French officials.\n\nBelow the guidelineAbove the guideline More than 6,000 children younger than age 6 live within a half mile of those locations, a Times analysis found.\n\nThe Times\u2019s investigation drew on confidential documents, including warnings by labor inspectors, a police report and previously undisclosed lead measurements by the Culture Ministry. Two French news organizations, Mediapart and Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9, have also investigated the lead concerns.\n\nThe documents, as well as scores of interviews, make clear that the French authorities had indications that lead exposure could be a grave problem within 48 hours of the fire.\n\nBut it took a month before city officials conducted the first lead tests at a school close to Notre-Dame. Even today, city and regional health officials have not tested every school in the proximity of the cathedral.\n\nThe tests showed levels of lead dust above the French regulatory standard for buildings hosting children in at least 18 day care centers, preschools and primary schools.\n\nIn dozens of other public spaces, like plazas and streets, authorities found lead levels up to 60 times over the safety standard. Soil contamination in public parks may be among the biggest concerns.\n\nThe highest contamination levels, revealed in the confidential Culture Ministry documents obtained by The Times, were at different spots in, or near, the cathedral site. The authorities failed to clean the entire area in the immediate aftermath of the fire and waited four months to finish a full decontamination of the neighborhood.\n\nWorkers wore protective suits during decontamination operations at Notre-Dame this month. Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times\n\nThe Culture Ministry, which is responsible for cleaning the site and rebuilding Notre-Dame, also failed or refused to enforce safety procedures for workers, leaving them exposed to lead levels more than a thousand times the accepted standard.\n\n\u201cThese are astronomical levels, and the attitude of health authorities is inexplicable,\u201d said Annie Th\u00e9baud-Mony, a prominent public health expert in France, who has been leading public calls for more transparency in the aftermath of the fire.\n\nThe lead levels were concerning enough that some health experts consulted by The Times advised against taking small children near Notre-Dame, though all agreed it was safe to visit Paris.\n\nSome French officials and lead experts have cautioned against \u2018\u2018paranoia\u2019\u2019 and argued that in a city as old as Paris, not all of the high lead levels can be attributed to the Notre-Dame fire. The test results may in part reflect broader underlying problems with lead contamination in Paris.\n\nLead exposure poses the greatest risk to children, especially under age 6, as well as to pregnant women and nursing mothers, who can pass lead on to their children.\n\nIf ingested, lead interferes with the normal development of the nervous system and can leave young children with permanent cognitive damage, producing problems that range from the loss of a few I.Q. points to difficulties with reading and a tendency toward aggressive behavior.\n\nEven so, hundreds of children attended schools near Notre-Dame for weeks before the authorities began in mid-May to test for lead levels, or to clean the buildings.\n\nThe Saint-Andr\u00e9 des Arts primary school is one of the schools where the highest levels of lead were found. Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a no-brainer that if you incinerate hundreds of tons of lead, you\u2019re going to have some significant deposition of particles in the neighborhood,\u201d said Matthew J. Chach\u00e8re, the longtime counsel to the New York City Coalition to End Lead Poisoning.\n\n\u2018\u2018I would think there would have been sufficient knowledge among public health authorities to realize that this had the potential to cause a great deal of environmental harm,\u201d Mr. Chach\u00e8re said.\n\nNotre-Dame is a unique structure in France, and in the aftermath of the fire, the official response was divided between city, regional and national officials. Each had distinct responsibilities, and sometimes competing interests, as lines of authority collided, undermining accountability.\n\nDebris inside the cathedral. Pool photo by St\u00e9phane de Sakutin\n\nCity officials, who didn\u2019t order lead testing until a month after the fire, said they had wanted to communicate more openly with the public but were following the lead of regional and national agencies.\n\n\u201cThe state was afraid to make people afraid,\u201d said Anne Souyris, the city\u2019s deputy mayor in charge of health, who also noted that officials were faced with a singular disaster that left them struggling to navigate regulatory vagaries.\n\n\u201cThey thought that they would protect people by not communicating about the lead issue,\u201d she said\n\nThis month, Paris officials opened public schools for a new academic year and said none presented alarming lead levels any longer. Some private schools did not open on time, for fear of lead.\n\nMany parents are unconvinced that the schools are lead free, partly because of the lack of transparency from the authorities.\n\nOnly gradually did public awareness of the problem grow. It took a lawsuit, leaked test results in the French press and public criticism from experts.\n\nExperts have differed on whether the city should conduct mandatory testing on children in the exposed area. Some French experts argue that high lead levels on surfaces do not necessarily correlate with individual children being contaminated.\n\nBut many children were put at risk. More than 6,000 people under age 6 live within a half-mile of sites that tested high for lead levels.\n\nOutdoor locations tested with lead levels higher than French safety guidelines Each dot represents one child under age 6 Schools tested both indoors and outdoors with lead levels higher than French safety guidelines 8TH ARR. 1ST ARR.

As sirens blared and firefighters worried that Notre-Dame might collapse, a day care center inside the police building was hurriedly closed, for fear it could be crushed by falling debris.\n\nWithin days, the day care center, which was for the children of officers, was tested for lead. In some areas, like the \u201cmillipede playroom,\u201d the tests found lead levels up to 2.5 times the French standard for buildings hosting children, according to a confidential police document.\n\nThe report offers evidence that the French authorities were aware of the threat of lead contamination within days of the fire but kept quiet.\n\nThe officers\u2019 children were moved to a second day care center farther away from Notre-Dame, in another building of the headquarters. As many as 80 children would play in this second day care center in the coming weeks. But it turned out that second building was contaminated, too.\n\nCleaning up at the Saint-Beno\u00eet school last month. Christophe Petit Tesson/EPA, via Shutterstock\n\nNew tests revealed more alarming results, which were initially kept from officers, and from the general public. Police authorities did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nAt the second day care center, more than 20 measurements showed lead levels at or above the threshold for buildings hosting children. They included the \u201cgoblins\u201d playroom and rooms where nurses fed children with baby bottles.\n\nWindows in the building had been left open during the fire, according to the confidential police report. Other tests found at least six offices were contaminated with lead levels up to 17 times higher than the regulatory threshold.\n\nExperts said the officers could have been vulnerable both to inhaling the dust as it swirled during the fire and ingesting it afterward.\n\n\u201cWe kept hearing rumors in corridors that made us worried,\u201d said one officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of police guidelines, and whose 2-year-old daughter was one of the children who used the playroom.\n\nIn early May, city officials finally closed the second day care center for decontamination and informed officers of the situation.\n\nBut still no broader alarm was sounded.\n\n\u201cWe took measures immediately and closed our own day care centers for a month and a half,\u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guillo, a police officer and representative at the C.G.T., one of France\u2019s largest unions.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t public authorities do anything for the other ones?\u201d he asked.\n\nOne problem is that different messages were coming from different government agencies.\n\nOn May 9, the Regional Health Agency released a reassuring statement to the public, merely confirming \u2018\u2018the presence of lead dust in the immediate surroundings of the cathedral.\u2019\u2019\n\nAt the same time, officials from the Culture Ministry, responsible for Notre-Dame\u2019s reconstruction, were playing down the risks in a meeting with public health authorities, labor inspectors, police and local officials, according to one person who attended.\n\nAntoine-Marie Pr\u00e9aut, a regional conservator at the Culture Ministry, denied that and said the authorities took the concerns seriously. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been downplaying the risk over lead contamination,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\n\nTourists on Rue du Clo\u00eetre-Notre-Dame four months after the fire, when it was still being decontaminated. Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times\n\nThe city\u2019s public schools and day care centers near Notre-Dame remained open for weeks after the fire. In early May, city officials issued \u2018\u2018recommendations\u2019\u2019 for cleaning at schools around the cathedral but offered little guidance to parents.\n\nThen, without any public notice, the city began conducting the first tests for lead at public primary schools in mid-May. Ms. Souyris, the deputy mayor, said it was up to the heads of schools to inform parents of the tests. Some did but others did not, The Times found.\n\nDuring the next two weeks, nine primary schools and day care centers close to Notre-Dame were tested \u2014 six of which had lead levels up to 2.5 times the regulatory threshold.\n\nSchools closed for the summer in July, and public anxiety began to mount. In early July, Mediapart, a French investigative website, published the first leaked documents about lead concerns in and near Notre-Dame. Parents demanded greater clarity about the risks, and environmental groups sounded alarms.\n\nEarlier, the regional health agency had \u201cinvited\u201d pregnant women and children under 7 to have their lead levels tested. Now the agency focused on schools, widening the perimeter of concern and the number of schools for testing.\n\nAs results came in, it became clear that more and more schools had alarming levels of lead.\n\nBy then, children had already left for summer vacation, though some schools around Notre-Dame continued to operate as summer camps.\n\nIn at least 18 day care centers, preschools and primary schools, tests revealed lead levels over the recommended threshold. Two schools being used as summer camps were closed after tests revealed alarming lead levels.\n\nAt one, Saint-Beno\u00eet, in the Sixth Arrondissement \u2014 just across the Seine, on the Left Bank \u2014 several places in the school and its playground showed lead levels up to seven times recommended levels.\n\nAmong the rooms over the threshold was the cafeteria, where children are likely to put their hands in their mouths and on their food.\n\nLEAD LEVELS (in micrograms per square foot) Above the French safety guidelines Below the French safety guidelines 8.8 Cafeteria Saint-Beno\u00eet primary school Schoolyard Where lead levels were tested 661 Classrooms Paris 61 Notre-Dame Cathedral Basement School Rue Saint-Beno\u00eet LEAD LEVELS (in micrograms per square foot) Above the French safety guidelines Below the French safety guidelines 8.8 Cafeteria Saint-Beno\u00eet primary school Schoolyard Where lead levels were tested 661 Classrooms Paris 61 Notre-Dame Cathedral Basement School Rue Saint-Beno\u00eet LEAD LEVELS (in micrograms per square foot) Above the French safety guidelines Below the French safety guidelines Cafeteria 8.8 Schoolyard 661 Classrooms Where lead levels were tested 61 Basement Rue Saint-Beno\u00eet Paris School Notre-Dame Cathedral Saint-Beno\u00eet primary school LEAD LEVELS (in micrograms per square foot) Above the French safety guidelines Below the French safety guidelines Cafeteria 8.8 Schoolyard 661 Classrooms Where lead levels were tested 61 Basement Rue Saint-Beno\u00eet Paris School Notre-Dame Cathedral Saint-Beno\u00eet primary school LEAD LEVELS (in micrograms per square foot) Above the French safety guidelines Below the French safety guidelines 8.8 Cafeteria Saint-Beno\u00eet primary school Schoolyard Where lead levels were tested 661 Classrooms Paris 61 Notre-Dame Cathedral Basement School Rue Saint-Beno\u00eet\n\nBecause Saint-Beno\u00eet and most other schools had not conducted tests for lead before the fire, city authorities have warned that high levels could have other historical causes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely that the levels found at Saint-Beno\u00eet were linked to the fire,\u201d argued Ariel Weil, the mayor of the city\u2019s Fourth Arrondissement, home to the cathedral. But he added, \u201cIf Notre-Dame has triggered an overall cleaning of Paris, so much the better.\u201d The head of the school did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhatever the source of the lead, in early August, workers in full, white protective outfits sprayed blue gel on the schoolyard\u2019s asphalt before tearing it up.\n\nIt remains unclear why all schools in the area were not tested sooner. Many of the test results were made public only after public pressure mounted. A few weeks later, in late July, a French environmental group filed a lawsuit against the government over its delayed response.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Ms. Souyris, the Paris deputy mayor in charge of public health, said local authorities had not publicized the test results because they wanted to coordinate with state officials. She also said, as do some other officials, that a city as old as Paris has a lead problem that long predates the Notre-Dame fire.\n\n\u201cWe are facing a widespread issue around lead,\u201d Ms. Souyris said. \u201cIt goes beyond Notre-Dame, but since there is no norm for public spaces, we need a bigger plan against lead in Paris.\u2019\u2019\n\nWith some exceptions, lead regulations in France are guidelines, not legally binding rules. That makes them essentially, optional.\n\nThe Health Ministry has ruled that lead levels over 70 micrograms per square meter, or 6.5 micrograms per square foot, amount to \u201ca risk of lead contamination for exposed children\u2019\u2019 and should lead to \u201ca quick intervention.\u201d\n\nBut that pertains to indoor spaces. In Paris, officials have waffled on the proper outdoor threshold.\n\nIn the weeks after the fire, they cited 93 micrograms per square foot as the guideline. But as public criticism reached a fever pitch in mid-July, regional health officials essentially raised the limit, citing a new figure of 464.\n\nAt Combattants de la Nueve, a tiny square where children play from a kindergarten less than a quarter mile from Notre-Dame, tests in late August showed soaring lead levels.\n\nThe Regional Health Agency said people should \u201cexpect\u201d high blood lead levels with such exposure and \u2018\u2018invited\u2019\u2019 the children who attended the kindergarten to have their blood lead tested.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge concern,\u201d said Perry Gottesfeld, executive director of Occupational Knowledge International, and an expert on lead testing and health, \u201cbecause we know that soil contamination in this range is closely linked to elevated blood lead levels.\u201d\n\nBut indoor or outdoor, the guidelines are essentially voluntary, not legally binding. That regulatory void has created confusion among authorities, reinforcing concerns of parents and other residents.\n\n\u201cWe could have communicated earlier,\u201d Ms. Souyris said. \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t even have norms for public spaces may have explained why health authorities took so much time in communicating more.\u201d\n\nWorry increased as questions went unanswered\n\nAs Parisian families send their children back to school, many are wondering whether their children have been exposed to lead, and whether they are still at risk.\n\n\u201cSchools and local authorities first tried to be reassuring,\u201d said Anne Souleliac, a mother of three, who lives in the Fifth Arrondissement.\n\n\u201cBut have we really gotten the measure of the risk? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nIn May, Ms. Souleliac asked the principal at her eldest son\u2019s private primary school to conduct lead tests, but her demands were ignored, she said. By August, school officials had pivoted and conducted the tests after officials widened the area of concern. The results were not publicly released, but the opening of the school was delayed for the fall term.\n\nAnne Souleliac with her daughter at home in the Fifth Arrondissement. Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times\n\nIn all, five private primary schools did not reopen on time, as the authorities continued to test for lead.\n\nThough the Regional Health Agency has resisted calling for mandatory testing of children, the parents of roughly 400 children have had them tested, many on their own initiative, the agency said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nOf those, 8.5 percent showed levels at or above the French regulatory threshold for concern. The agency did not reveal which schools the children attended.\n\nPublic officials have emphasized that \u201cenvironmental measurements\u201d conducted as early as the day after the fire had revealed a \u201cgood air quality.\u201d No mention was made of the hundreds of bystanders who watched Notre-Dame burn and may have been exposed to lead dust in the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s understandable that parents ask questions,\u201d said Dr. Fabien Squinazi, a former head of the Paris Public Health Laboratory who advised the authorities over the summer. \u201cBut if children have spent a couple of minutes in a schoolyard with high lead levels and the rest of the day in a classroom that is not contaminated, there is no reason to be worried.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018A high lead level on surfaces doesn\u2019t automatically mean that a child has been contaminated,\u201d he said.\n\nThe area that has gotten the most official attention is the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, the island in the Seine where Notre-Dame is located. Local authorities set up a special center to test children under 7 and pregnant women living there.\n\nBut for everyone else, including those living in the broader area of concern, lead tests are provided only to people with special prescriptions from doctors.\n\nMs. Souleliac, who works on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 but does not live there, wanted her daughter to be tested as quickly as possible. But that proved challenging. Her doctor and day care center were not alarmed at first.\n\n\u201cIt took health authorities two months to test my daughter, two months to take tests at the day care and at my nanny\u2019s apartment,\u201d Ms. Souleliac said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure people are aware of how toxic lead can be for young children.\u201d\n\nWhen she was finally tested, the girl had 1.1 micrograms of lead per deciliter, below the threshold of 2.5 micrograms.\n\nThe regulatory threshold for concern in France is 2.5 micrograms per deciliter, but experts warn that any level of lead can cause harm.\n\nCatherine Leroy had not thought about potential health risks for her 2\u00bd-year-old daughter until news articles mentioned lead concerns and friends warned her about toxic particles.\n\nCatherine Leroy with her daughter, near the cathedral. Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times\n\nMs. Leroy, who lives on Rue Chanoinesse, less than 300 feet from the cathedral, took the child for a test in mid-May. The results showed lead levels of 1.9 micrograms per deciliter.\n\nThe result wasn\u2019t alarming, she was told, but state contractors cleaned her apartment anyway because it was deemed to be in a risky zone.\n\n\u201cThe authorities have poorly communicated about it,\u201d Ms. Leroy said on a recent morning, as she took the girl to a nearby park on her bike.\n\n\u201cWe received information bit by bit,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018But we\u2019ve been feeling a little forgotten.\u201d\n\nThose most in danger? The restoration workers\n\nThe people exposed to the highest levels of lead have been the workers at the cathedral itself. Amid growing public concern over contamination, the authorities shut down work at Notre-Dame in July, saying stricter measures were needed \u201cin accordance to labor inspection\u2019s requests.\u201d\n\nIn fact, work at the site was stopped only after seven alarming letters, dozens of emails and a series of heated meetings between labor inspectors and those trying to carry out reconstruction of Notre-Dame on President Macron\u2019s ambitious five-year timetable.\n\nThe confidential letters from labor inspectors, obtained by The Times, reveal a multitude of lapses that exposed workers to exceptionally high levels of lead.\n\nTests taken inside the cathedral found lead levels up to 588 times above the regulatory threshold.\n\nFrench safety guideline 93 micrograms per square foot 216,898 Roof 175,240 micrograms per square foot 72,371 49,671 21,053 April 29 August 7 Ground floor 24,384 29,211 18,814 16,059 April 29 August 7 French safety guideline 93 micrograms per square foot Roof 216,898 175,240 micrograms per sq. foot 72,371 April 29 August 7 Ground floor 24,384 29,211 16,059 April 29 August 7\n\nOn the plaza, open to workers and security agents, levels were up to 1,300 times higher, according to the Culture Ministry\u2019s confidential measurements obtained by The Times. Outside the construction site on the nearby pavements, workers were exposed to lead levels up to 955 times the threshold.\n\nA month after the fire, one labor inspector warned that safety gear was not being worn by some workers and urged authorities \u201cto implement, without waiting, measures to protect employees for risks of lead exposure.\u201d\n\nAdding to the dangers, inspectors noticed that workers operating inside the cathedral were not decontaminating their clothes under their jumpsuits as they left work. Workers would then bring those clothes back home, exposing their families to possible lead contamination.\n\nTheir children should be screened, said Dr. Squinazi, the Paris expert. \u201cThat\u2019s a big criteria,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Children of workers are running a greater risk.\u201d\n\nPolice officers without protective gear inside the cathedral the day after the fire. Pool photo by Christophe Petit Tesson\n\nWhen workers started to decontaminate the plaza, in early June, they wore no protection, and had not received any training about lead exposure, the labor inspector found. In a final letter dated July 22, another labor inspector found workers entering the site through the decontamination units that were supposed to be used to let them out.\n\n\u201cThe current organization doesn\u2019t allow an effective decontamination of the workers,\u201d the inspector concluded.\n\nThe inspector threatened to shut down the site if safety measures weren\u2019t followed. Three days later it was.\n\nFurious union officials have accused the government of putting the reconstruction of the monument ahead of health concerns. The Culture Ministry rejects the claim.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not denying that there has been a risk with lead, but the measures we implemented really soon after the fire have helped avoid exposing workers,\u201d said Mr. Pr\u00e9aut, the Culture Ministry conservator.\n\nWorkers wearing masks on the rooftop of Notre-Dame in August. Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times\n\nOf the dozens of workers who have been at the site, Mr. Pr\u00e9aut said, three had shown lead levels over the regulatory threshold in their blood. They are being monitored by doctors.\n\nThe contractors being used say they test their workers, but they have not released the results because of medical confidentiality.\n\nMr. Pr\u00e9aut said lead exposure is a complicated topic, partly because of the lack of clear regulatory thresholds.\n\n\u201cThere is lead elsewhere in Paris,\u201d Mr. Pr\u00e9aut said, \u201cAnd every time there is construction here, we find some lead around it.\u201d\n\nWork on the cathedral resumed on Aug. 19 with a host of new safety measures, including foot baths, decontamination showers and disposable underwear. A contracting company decontaminates work clothes. Strict checks have been put in place on entering and leaving the site.\n\nYet even after construction resumed, workers could still be seen wearing no gloves or masks on the northern side of the cathedral. Lead levels in that area were up to 10 times above the recommended threshold, according to the Culture Ministry\u2019s own measurements.\n\nThe long plume of smoke that rose from the cathedral. Maxime Brunet/Elastiqueprod, via Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\nOn the roof, where some workers operated without masks or gloves for months, some measurements were 2,300 times above the safety threshold.\n\nNotre-Dame\u2019s architect in chief, Philippe Villeneuve, called the lead one of the most complex challenges facing the reconstruction.\n\n\u201cThe roof, the spire, the vaults, we know how to reconstruct them,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018But lead? We don\u2019t know the thresholds, or the exact rules to follow.\u201d\n\nHe and others now fear the work will be slowed by the precautions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not working with the same rhythm and constraints anymore,\u201d he said, blaming \u201cthe lead issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not done with that lead thing.\u201d\n\nFor merchants, the pain is continuing\n\nIn the streets around Notre-Dame, business owners have seen revenues plunge since the fire. Tourists have been blocked from some streets, the plaza and the cathedral, once among the most visited sites in the world.\n\nMerchants say that city or state inspectors have conducted lead tests in their cafes and restaurants, and that they are safe for customers.\n\nAt Au Vieux Paris d\u2019Arcole, a restaurant one street away from Notre-Dame, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Benani, a waiter, said measurements had been taken inside and on the terrace. Visitors who posed for selfies in front of the restaurant\u2019s iconic wisteria had no reason for concern, he said.\n\nRevenues have plunged at restaurants and cafes near the cathedral, once filled with tourists. Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want people to freak out, it\u2019s already been painful enough,\u201d said Mr. Benani, who watched the cathedral burn from the window of his apartment above the restaurant.\n\nThe street adjacent to Notre-Dame was decontaminated in late August.
