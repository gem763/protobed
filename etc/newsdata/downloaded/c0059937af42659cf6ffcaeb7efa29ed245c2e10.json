They split a four-game set in Los Angeles in mid-May \u2014 just before they started their famous run after May 24 \u2014 and later dropped two of three competitive games in Washington. The Nationals have, in low voices, expressed a belief that they match up well with the Dodgers. Their rotation is just as good, if not better, and both bullpens have been shaky at times. The Dodgers have a stronger, deeper lineup, but the Nationals feel confident with their hitters. The Dodgers are a juggernaut, so think of the Nationals\u2019 attitude here as less \u201cconfident\u201d and more \u201cnot intimidated.\u201d\n\nHow the Nationals match up with the top-seeded, very scary Dodgers\n\nWashington\u2019s Game 1 starter, Patrick Corbin, certainly helps this mind-set. The left-hander, signed in the offseason for games like this, is familiar with the Dodgers from his six seasons with the Arizona Diamondbacks, their NL West foe. He has a career 3.36 ERA against the Dodgers in 21 appearances, and he bettered those numbers this year when he blanked them across seven scoreless innings in Dodger Stadium. Corbin flashed his ability to navigate out of trouble by allowing three hits and walking four but not allowing a run. The Dodgers, meanwhile, were coy about who would get the ball for them in Game 1 but eventually announced Walker Buehler, who won 14 games and posted a 3.26 ERA in 30 starts. He also struck out 10.6 batters per nine innings \u2014 the same rate as Corbin \u2014 so expect a lot of swings and misses when the two face off at Dodger Stadium.\n\nNationals\u2019 NLDS roster analysis: A seven-man bullpen and a six-man bench\n\nLineups\n\nNationals:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick 1B\n\nAsdr\u00fabal Cabrera 2B\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nYan Gomes C\n\nPatrick Corbin P\n\nDodgers:\n\nA.J.

At this very moment, he is better than anyone the Los Angeles Dodgers can throw against him, Clayton Kershaw included. The Nats should pitch him as much as humanly possible.
