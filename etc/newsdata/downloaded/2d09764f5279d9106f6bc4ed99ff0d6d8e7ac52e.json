And while we can\u2019t reveal what splits Robron apart, Aaron will end up back in the village \u2013 and feeling hollow and distraught without his soulmate.\n\nSpeaking about Chas\u2019 fears for her son, Lucy shared: \u2018She\u2019s worried about his state of mind, she\u2019s worried about what could happen to Aaron, as in his self harming or his depression or going off the rails. That\u2019s always in the background. She\u2019s offered her help, she\u2019s tried to be strong and said right get over him you need to move forward and try to be there for him, so she\u2019s quite concerned about his mental state.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not just Aaron that she is anxious about either. After giving birth to her new baby \u2013 in the Woolpack toilets of all places \u2013 Lucy reckons that Chas will be quite an anxious and paranoid mother to the newborn at first.\n\nShe pondered: \u2018She will be a little more fearful, more wanting her baby monitor next to her constantly and maybe a movement pad underneath and a breathing thing on her and I think she will be by her side every minute that she can.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s starting back to work straight away so the baby will be with her behind the bar. Like any mum, that paranoia of I\u2019ve got to keep looking at her and waking her up and checking on her, but they know that there\u2019s nothing physically wrong with the baby. She\u2019s going to be slightly more paranoid but hopefully as the months go on, they settle in to parenthood and things will calm down a bit.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Lucy Pargeter reveals what comes next.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/robert-aaron-exit-emmerdale-474747-ebdb_1570445320.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
