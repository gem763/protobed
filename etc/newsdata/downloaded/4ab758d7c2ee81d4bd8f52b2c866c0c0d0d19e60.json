Martin\u2019s \u201cFire & Blood,\u201d HBO said. The new drama was co-created by Martin and Ryan Condal, whose credits include \u201cColony.\u201d\n\nIt will focus on House Targaryen, made famous in \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d by Emilia Clarke\u2019s Daenerys and her fearsome dragons.\n\n\u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d was announced by HBO programming president Casey Bloys during a presentation for HBO Max, the streaming service launching in May 2020 . A spinoff of HBO megahit \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d would be a key attraction in the increasingly crowded streaming marketplace.\n\nHBO declined comment on reports Tuesday that it had dropped another \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d prequel set thousands of years before the original. A pilot episode starring Watts had been filmed in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe straight-to-series order for \u201cHouse of the Dragon,\u201d whether a sign of faith in the project or pressure to get it into production, avoids letting devotees of the fantasy saga down once more.\n\nCasting and an air date were not announced.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "HBO is green-lighting a new \"Game of Thrones\" prequel after reportedly canceling another that starred Naomi Watts.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
