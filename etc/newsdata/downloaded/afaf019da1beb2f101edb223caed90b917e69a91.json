You can get your stage fix at your local movie theater or hear a play while jogging.\n\nTheater just isn\u2019t what it used to be.\n\nMedia companies armed with the latest in technology like Fathom Events, Audible Inc. and BroadwayHD are reshaping the experience, evolving it past the quaint notion of patrons filing into an arena, turning off their phones and sitting quietly in the dark.\n\nKicking yourself that you never saw the musical \u201cKinky Boots\u201d or the play \u201cFleabag\u201d? Relax. Cinema distributor Fathom has you covered. Can\u2019t wait for the live-action \u201cCats\u201d movie? Then watch a stage version while cuddling your own cat on th couch, thanks to digital theater streaming network BroadwayHD. Or, if you\u2019re in a more serious mood, put on your headphones and listen to the play \u201cTrue West,\u201d co-starring Kit Harrington, via Audible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really going into a place where I hope people look at what theater is differently,\u201d said Kate Navin, who leads the theater initiative at Audible, the world\u2019s largest producer of audiobooks and spoken-word entertainment.\n\nThe prices can\u2019t be beat: A Fathom screening will cost you $20, a monthly subscription to BroadwayHD runs $8.99 and an audio play costs $7.95 - all a fraction of a Broadway ticket, which can run you hundreds of dollars.\n\nBroadcasting Broadway shows on TV is nothing new, of course. PBS\u2019s \u201cGreat Performances\u201d has been doing it for 40 years. But BroadwayHD argues they\u2019re using the latest technology to make their shows pop.\n\nIf rivals rely on a few cameras capturing the stage from the same couple of angles, BroadwayHD promises the \u201cbest seat in the house\u201d for each and every scene. For \u201c42nd Street,\u201d it used eight different 4K cameras, shot three different performances and used extra footage to augment them.\n\nThese media companies are also changing what success means in the theater world, which usually means total tickets sold. Carey Mulligan\u2019s short run of \u201cGirls & Boys\u201d at the small Minetta Lane Theatre in 2018 was well-received but its subsequent reach was much wider than what was captured at the box office.\n\nThe Audible audio version of her play has sold the equivalent of 26 sold-out weeks at Broadway\u2019s Booth Theatre, which seats 770. \u201cThe traditional ways of evaluating whether or not a run was successful don\u2019t really apply anymore,\u201d said Navin.\n\nAudible has made a strong push into theater, not only recording dozens of in-studio plays but also commissioning writers and staging works at its off-Broadway venue, the 400-seat Minetta Lane Theatre. It is perfecting a form of theater without visuals.\n\nNot everything on stage can work as an audio download. Plays with big visual effects are hard. So are farces. \u201cBut really because theater is the art of language, a lot of it works,\u201d said Navin. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to replace the live experience. What we really think this will do is expand the audience.\u201d\n\nIf Audible skips the optics in favor of a private sonic drama, Fathom embraces the visual and communal parts of theater. It distributes big Broadway musicals like \u201cBandstand\u201d and \u201cNewsies\u201d and often partners with the United Kingdom\u2019s National Theater Live to put shows on 40-foot movie theater screens.\n\nFathom, which is owned by the cinema chains AMC, Cinemark and Regal, offers fans a place to gather and celebrate, whether it\u2019s coming dressed as zombies to watch a season ending episode of \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d getting romantic watching the latest British royal wedding live (with tea and crumpets served) or cheering diversity at a screening of \u201cKinky Boots.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo see people sitting there applauding at the end of an act or at the end of a song as if they were there in that Broadway theater, that is just an awesome experience that you can\u2019t replicate at home,\u201d said Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom.\n\nBroadwayHD is hoping it that it can, in fact, replicate exactly that - streaming full-length plays and musicals like \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera\u201d and \u201cLes Miserables\u201d to your laptop, TV, phone or tablet. The company was the first to live broadcast a Broadway show - \u201cShe Loves Me\u201d with Laura Benanti - and recently captured a big and bold production of \u201c42nd Street\u201d from London.\n\nStewart F. Lane and Bonnie Comley founded the company in 2015 with a focus on shows with limited runs - often with a celebrity or two - as well as shows that are closing imminently. They work carefully with theater producers to ensure cannibalization of tickets to the live show doesn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in any way trying to kill the goose that lays the golden egg,\u201d said Comley. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is make this available, make it a marketing asset, make it another way for the audiences to have a touchpoint with these brands.\u201d\n\nBroadwayHD, which has some 300 shows, is for subscribers who can\u2019t fly to New York, can\u2019t afford pricey tickets or simply don\u2019t want to navigate Times Square. It offers closed-captioning for the hearing impaired and a chance for theater lovers across the world to see a treasured title come to life.\n\n\u201cOnce the shows close, people tend to forget what it looked like, tend to forget how big the cast was, what the set looked like,\u201d said Lane. \u201cYou actually have a reference now to actually use to see whether it would fit on their stage and whether they\u2019d want to do the show.\u201d\n\nSome Broadway producers love the idea and some are colder. Many are in the middle, like Mike Bosner, who has produced \u201cBeautiful: The Carole King Musical\u201d and the recent revival of \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d with Glenn Close.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not trying to be coy about this. I really don\u2019t have an opinion on it. I go back and forth on it because one side of me says theater is meant to be live and it\u2019s meant to be experienced and it\u2019s meant to live on only in the archives,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut the plus side when they do that type of thing is you\u2019re bringing it to many people around the world that may not get the opportunity to go see that show in any other way.\u201d\n\nOther media companies are taking note: Nickelodeon is reforming the Broadway cast of \u201cThe SpongeBob Musical\u201d and will film it in front of a live theater audience for a December broadcast. On Netflix, you can catch Kerry Washington in the play \u201cAmerican Son\u201d and Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Broadway show, both now closed.\n\nAll these companies are helping remake one of the most ancient of art forms, redefining it by playing with its elements - visual, communal and live. The result is something more democratic - and evolving.\n\n\u201cI think once you get outside the New York bubble, people think that theater is very elitist, inaccessible, for the highly educated. It doesn\u2019t mean that,\u201d Navin said. \u201cIt means something different. Just like TV doesn\u2019t mean one thing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When James Corden kicked off the Tony Awards this year, his opening number was a full-throated endorsement of the live theatrical experience.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Kennedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/theater_thats_not_live_29993_c0-494-6728-4418_s1200x700.jpg?8640c83ffc5776856e089da2eef1afd3b9d0a739", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
