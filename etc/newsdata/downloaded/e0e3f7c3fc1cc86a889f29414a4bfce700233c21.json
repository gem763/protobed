It was delivered from the touchline, 30 yards away, and sent him scurrying in on goal. Raul Jimenez was the recipient, Riyad Mahrez his supplier. It was inadvertent. The defence he had split was his own. The forward the Algerian found was not Sergio Aguero, but his Wolves counterpart. Fernandinho came to Mahrez\u2019s rescue, recovering to block the Mexican\u2019s shot, but it felt the lone piece of creativity Manchester City produced in their first home defeat of 2019.\n\nFernandinho\u2019s valiant efforts came in vain. His amounted to a heroic damage-limitation exercise. Alongside him \u2013 or, more frequently, on his backside as his rash attempts to throw himself into challenges backfired \u2013 was Nicolas Otamendi. Hyperbolically branded \u2018Superman\u2019 by Pep Guardiola two years ago, the Argentinian was more blooperman in a display of clownish ineptitude. \u201cThey were quite good,\u201d said the City manager, in an implausible defence of an errant defence.\n\nYet as Wolves\u2019 keen counter-attackers exposed City\u2019s soft underbelly, it was a moot point who the champions missed more: the sidelined centre-backs John Stones and Aymeric Laporte, or the missing midfielder Kevin De Bruyne.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

De Bruyne has twice as many assists as anyone else; not just at City, but in the division as a whole.\n\nLacking a player who has made eight goals and who has delivered 29 key passes, City registered two shots on target against a Wolves team who had conceded three goals to Everton and five to Chelsea. The defiance of Willy Boly and Conor Coady showed the defensive improvement Nuno Espirito Santo has engineered since then but City, who had mustered the most goals in the opening seven games of a top-flight season since the 19th century, drew a blank.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Joao Cancelo - 4/10 He has only played 36 minutes in a City shirt despite being one of the best full backs in Europe. His time will come, but at the moment he is experiencing the same frustration Danilo endured behind Kyle Walker. Manchester City FC via Getty Ima 2/20 19. Moise Kean - 4/10 Last season he emerged as one of the best young forwards in Europe at Juventus. He has failed to live up to the hype so far at Everton, but it\u2019s still early in his Premier League career. Everton FC via Getty Images 3/20 18. David Luiz - 4/10 His move surprised many when he joined Arsenal from London rivals Chelsea. He has been at fault for numerous goals since his arrival, including a nightmare performance at Anfield. Improvement needed. Getty Images 4/20 17. Giovani Lo Celso - 5/10 The Argentinian's hotly anticipated arrival in London has been blighted by a hip injury that's restricted him to 44 minutes in the Premier League. Getty Images 5/20 16. Joelinton - 5.5/10 When Rondon left St James Park last season, fans were worried they\u2019d struggle to replace him. Joelinton has only managed one goal in his last seven game, however, there have been promising flashes from the Brazilian. Getty Images 6/20 15. Raul Jimenez - 6/10 After last season\u2019s 13 goals and 10 assists, Jimenez will no doubt prove a valuable acquisition for Wolves. Just two goals so far this season means he has been underwhelming. Getty Images 7/20 14. Adam Webster - 6/10 Duffy had been a stalwart in Brighton\u2019 side. Youngster Webster has managed to breakthrough in his place. Barring a poor lapse in concentration against Chelsea he has been solid. PA 8/20 13. Nicolas Pepe - 6/10 The \u00a372m winger is still adjusting to English football and has yet to recapture his goalscoring form at Lille. However, the signs of his quality are obvious for all to see. Getty Images 9/20 12. Sebastian Haller - 6.5/10 Haller started off slowly. But a brace at Watford set him on his way and he\u2019s now on three goals and one assist. If he can replicate his form from his time in Frankfurt, West Ham will be dangerous. Getty Images 10/20 11. Tyrone Mings - 6.5/10 Earned an England call-up through his performances, after making his loan spell permanent, but hasn't been able to totally sure up Villa's leaky defence. Aston Villa FC via Getty Images 11/20 10. Harry Maguire - 7/10 Has immediately improved United's defence since his impressive debut and adds leadership to a currently wildly inconsistent side. Getty Images 12/20 9. Moussa Djenepo - 7/10 Due to injury, Djenepo has only managed three appearances for Southampton. He has scored two goals though, and has brought pace and finishing ability reminiscent of Sadio Mane\u2019s time on the south coast. Action Images via Reuters 13/20 8. Aaron Wan-Bissaka - 7/10 With the most tackles in the league, Wan- Bissaka has been solid. The only criticism for the young full back? Going forward he could improve. Getty Images 14/20 7. Gary Cahill - 7.5/10 Has added some invaluable know-how to Palace\u2019s defence. A win at Old Trafford on debut and two clean sheets since then. Good start for the Champions League winner. REUTERS 15/20 6. Harry Wilson - 7.5/10 On loan from Liverpool, the young Welshman has produced moments of quality, including a long range strike (albeit deflected) at Villa Park and a delightful free kick against the Champions. Getty Images 16/20 5. Dani Ceballos - 7.5/10 The Spaniard has been superb for the most part. He has been instrumental in Arsenal\u2019s midfield. If you want to be cynical, it would be nice to see more in the goals and assist columns. UEFA via Getty Images 17/20 4. Rodrigo - 7.5/10 Has integrated relatively seamlessly into Guardiola's starting eleven and already feels as though he has been part of City's set up for a long time. Action Images via Reuters 18/20 3. Tanguy Ndombele - 7.5/10 Arguably one of the most well rounded midfielders in Europe. It\u2019s early days at Spurs but Ndombele has added goals and security in midfield. Getty Images 19/20 2. Daniel James - 8/10 What a bargain \u00a315 million was. Three goals this season and one of few causes for optimism in an abject Man Utd side. Potentially signing of the season if he keeps it up. Plus, he has all the time in the world to develop at 21 years of age. Getty Images 20/20 1. Youri Tielemans - 8.5/10 Superb start from Tielemans since joining the Foxes on a permanent basis. He is level with De Bruyne for completed through balls and has been a huge help to Maddison. Getty Images 1/20 20.

He is level with De Bruyne for completed through balls and has been a huge help to Maddison. Getty Images\n\nDe Bruyne went unnamed in Guardiola\u2019s analysis, but he is the constant in City\u2019s creativity. \u201cToday was the day we create less than the others,\u201d he said. \u201cEven [in defeat to] Norwich we create a lot. Our process to create chances was not good. We face many teams defending deep and more or less we found a way to do it but today we had a problem.\u201d\n\nThose deep defences came be unlocked by De Bruyne\u2019s delivery. He can be Beckham-esque crosser or Gerrard-esque force of nature. His capacity to make things happen renders him a catalyst. City posted 98 points last season when De Bruyne figured in fewer than a third of the minutes. This time, however, they could not compensate for the talisman\u2019s absence.\n\nDavid Silva was below par, to the extent there was the rare sight of City\u2019s captain being substituted when his side required a goal. Sergio Aguero was isolated, restricted to 24 touches. Mahrez\u2019s early-season excellence felt a mirage on the day.\n\nPerhaps it did not help, either, that Bernardo Silva, who stepped so adeptly into De Bruyne\u2019s shoes for much of last season, began on the bench. Despite his hat-trick against Watford, the Portuguese has not touched the heights he hit last season when Guardiola, who described him as \u201cthe best player in the best team,\u201d felt he ought to have been named Footballer of the Year. Thus far, he trails far behind candidates such as De Bruyne, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino. Maybe his impending FA charge has affected his confidence, but Silva brought improvement in his cameo.\n\nBut the man who began on the right of the midfield trident was the conundrum that is Ilkay Gundogan, neither an attacking midfielder nor a defensive one. The German offered precision in possession, but not penetration. City missed De Bruyne\u2019s infield crossing from the inside-right channel. Guardiola often mentions that City lack height, but such is the accuracy of the Belgian\u2019s delivery that they do not need it when he picks out their diminutive attackers.\n\nTheir total of 35 crosses was scarcely the 81 David Moyes\u2019 Manchester United infamously attempted against Fulham, but Wolves\u2019 giants headed them away and crowded City out to cut out the cut-backs. The full-backs Guardiola fielded, with Oleksandr Zinchenko replacing Kyle Walker at the break, had a combined 268 touches, but Wolves\u2019 3-5-2 formation meant they were often the spare men.\n\nOne of them, Joao Cancelo marked his first Premier League start by coughing up possession for the first of Adama Traore\u2019s double. \u201cLoose balls,\u201d lamented Guardiola but Cancelo\u2019s misplaced pass proved the most influential one a De Bruyne-less City played all day.", "description": "It had incision and precision, a defence-splitting pass bent into the striker\u2019s path.
