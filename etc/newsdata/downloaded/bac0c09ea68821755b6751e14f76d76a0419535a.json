As Breitbart reported:\n\nWell, I thought it was most stunning and scary. I was amazed at that and rather disappointed that the attorney general would say such a thing. The term \u201cspying\u201d has all kinds of negative connotations, and I have to believe he chose that term deliberately. And I think it\u2019s incredible that if he has concerns, he would have easily on his first day on the job, after his confirmation, asked his own IG, the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, for a briefing on his preliminary, in the course of his investigation, that is, the IG\u2019s investigation, whether there was any wrongdoing by the FBI.\n\nBarr has more than that, it would seem and has sent chills up Clapper\u2019s spine that the walls may be closing in, not on President Trump, but on Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan for their seditious roles in the attempted coup against the President. According to a Wall Street Journal report:\n\nFormer Director of National Intelligence James Clapper says\u2026 that Attorney General William Barr appears to be investigating a high-confidence finding of the US intelligence community assessment of the 2016 election sends a \"chilling message to the intelligence community.\"\n\nBrennan may be hearing those footsteps get louder as well with his increasingly hysterical commentaries at MSNBC, which, along with CNN, is where liars and leakers go to die, warning President Trump to keep off the grass. As Fox News reports:\n\nBrennan\u2026 said he was \"supposedly\" going to be interviewed by U.S. Attorney John Durham but was concerned about Barr's role in the process of looking at the origins of the long-running Russia election meddling probe. Given that Barr is now accompanying Durham on these things, it really makes me think that the hand of politics and of Trump are now being used to massage what this ongoing review quasi-investigation is,\" Brennan told host Nicole Wallace. \"So I am concerned.\"\n\nFox News commentator and former congressman Jason Chaffetz notes Brennan\u2019s panic and feels he is right to be concerned:\n\nChaffetz expressed that it was important for Barr to investigate Brennan and former director of National Intelligence James Clapper. \"If you're going to get to the bottom of the FISA [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] abuse, you have to understand what those two gentlemen were doing or not doing, and Barr has to pursue those facts.\" \"I think Brennan and Clapper have both shown their political bias. I think they're frightened to death that Michael Horowitz report is on the verge of coming out, that Mr. Durham has been on their tail, that the truth is going to be exposed\u2026\"\n\nIt is laughable for Brennan to be concerned about \u201cthe hand of politics\u201d since it was his intelligence community that meddled in the 2016 elections in ways a foreign adversary such as Russia could only dream of and attempted to overthrow a duly elected president. And where did the Ukraine whistleblower come from? John Brennan\u2019s CIA.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer once warned, some would say threatened, Trump, even before he took office, regarding the power of the intelligence community and its wrath against those who question its authority over our government and our lives. As the Washington Examiner reported:\n\n\"Let me tell you: You take on the intelligence community -- they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Tuesday evening on MSNBC after host Rachel Maddow informed him that intelligence sources told NBC news that the briefing had not been delayed.\n\nIs the Ukraine \u201cwhistleblower\u201d the latest attempt by John Brennan\u2019s intelligence community \u201cgetting back\u201d at Trump?\n\nAs Rush Limbaugh and others have reported, Brennan took a trip to the Ukraine using a fake passport to dig up dirt on Trump:\n\n\u201cNow, John Brennan\u2019s hands are as dirty as Obama\u2019s in this whole thing. John Brennan\u2026 traveled to Ukraine back in the time period around 2016 under a fake passport so it wouldn\u2019t be known that he had gone, and he was arranging data on the dossier and all of the other dirt that they were trying to amass. Ukraine -- not Russia, Ukraine -- is the center of the universe of all this\u2026 \u201cJohn Brennan, Obama\u2019s director-CIA, went to Ukraine under a fake passport so that nobody would know it was him. Fake name. Can you do that? Can you get a fake passport? No. John Brennan can, CIA director. I\u2019m surprised he even needed a passport. But he went under a fake passport to get opposition research on Trump!\n\nAs I wrote here recently, Brennan may have colluded with foreign spies to help Hillary Clinton. And the mind harkens back to the day when an op/ed in the Washington Post, that right-wing rag, called for Brennan to be fired for conducting illegal surveillance of the Senate Intelligence Committee and then lying about it:\n\nBrennan was asked by NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell whether the CIA had illegally accessed Senate Intelligence Committee staff computers \u201cto thwart an investigation by the committee into\u201d the agency\u2019s past interrogation techniques\u2026 Brennan answered: As far as the allegations of, you know, CIA hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth. I mean, we wouldn\u2019t do that. I mean, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s just beyond the -- you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we would do. {\u2026} And, you know, when the facts come out on this, I think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong. (You can see the video of Brennan\u2019s answer here.) Now we know that the truth was far different. The Post\u2019s Greg Miller reports: CIA Director John O. Brennan has apologized to leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee after an agency investigation determined that its employees improperly searched computers used by committee staff to review classified files on interrogations of prisoners. {\u2026} A statement released by the CIA on Tuesday acknowledged that agency employees had searched areas of that computer network that were supposed to be accessible only to committee investigators. Agency employees were attempting to discover how congressional aides had obtained a secret CIA internal report on the interrogation program.\n\nBrennan\u2019s briefing of Sen. Harry Reid, which included information from the Steele dossier, certainly is a key indicator of his participation in the campaign to keep and/or kick Donald Trump out of the White House:\n\n\u201cAccording to Russian Roulette, by Yahoo! News chief investigative correspondent Michael Isikoff and David Corn, the Washington bureau chief of the left-wing Mother Jones, Brennan contacted Reid on Aug. 25, 2016, to brief him on the state of Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential campaign. Brennan briefed other members of the so-called Gang of Eight, but Reid is the only one who took direct action.\n\nTwo days after the briefing, Reid wrote a letter to then-FBI Director James Comey asserting that \u201cevidence of a direct connection between the Russian government and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign continues to mount.\u201d\n\nReid\u2019s letter referred to some public reporting about Trump campaign associates\u2019 links to the Kremlin, but he also included a reference to information that may not have been made public at the time. He cited allegations that were included in the infamous Steele dossier about Carter Page, an adviser to the Trump campaign at the time.\n\nBrennan is a ringleader in the deep state coup against Trump. Instead of accusing AG Bill Barr of being corrupt, this might be a good time for Brennan to exercise his right to be silent.\n\nDaniel John Sobieski is a former editorial writer for Investor\u2019s Business Daily and free lance writer whose pieces have appeared in Human Events, Reason Magazine, and the Chicago Sun-Times among other publications.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2019-10/216426.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
