Family offices said they plan to focus more on private equity next year - buying stakes in unlisted companies or the funds which invest in those companies - with a particular interest in technology firms.\n\nDirect private equity investment achieved the best returns for the families this year, at 16%.\n\nThe family offices overall had a return of 5.4%, based on different methodology from previous surveys, and compared with a 2.2% drop in the MSCI All Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS in the 12 months to May 2019.\n\nThe surveyed firms manage a total of $330 billion in assets.", "description": "The world's richest families are worried about the U.S.-China trade spat, Brexit, populism and climate change and are keeping more of their money in cash, according to a survey of family offices by the world's largest wealth manager.", "authors": ["Carolyn Cohn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
