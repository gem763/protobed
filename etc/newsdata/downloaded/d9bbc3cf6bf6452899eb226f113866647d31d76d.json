From the first whistle, it was plain that one slip could be the difference between something and nothing in terms of the result. And nothing would have seriously jeopardised Chelsea\u2019s chances of progress out of Group H.\n\nThis was the big test of the manager\u2019s developing lineup, of recent levels that had seen them win five successive matches in all competitions, and it was one that they passed in glorious style. The resilience of their defending, especially in the first-half, was particularly noteworthy, with Fikayo Tomori \u2013 one of the homegrown products \u2013 earning top billing.\n\nChristian Pulisic announces himself as the Lampard effect pays more dividends | Jacob Steinberg Read more\n\nA draw would have been a fine result but Chelsea pushed for more in the final 25 minutes as Ajax ran out of steam and ideas and, at the very end, they got it. Lampard could barely have scripted it better because it was two of his substitutes, Christian Pulisic and Michy Batshuayi \u2013 players who he has had to disappoint on a regular basis \u2013 who combined for the winner.\n\nPulisic was electric after his introduction, all quick feet and direct running, and it was from his low cross that Batshuayi profited, banging a firm finish in off the underside of the crossbar. Ajax were down and out and they, remember, are a team who had not previously tasted defeat this season. As Lampard pointed out, they might have lost Matthijs de Ligt and Frenkie de Jong over the summer but there are still plenty of good players in their team. It was not only De Ligt and De Jong who carried them to last season\u2019s Champions League semi-final.\n\nBatshuayi showed the hardiness of his mentality in scoring the goal because a little earlier, after a Pulisic shot had deflected through to him, he had blown a gilt-edged opportunity, blazing high when confronted by only the goalkeeper Andr\u00e9 Onana. Many strikers would have been affected by the lapse. Batshuayi was not.\n\nChelsea had ridden their luck, with the Ajax winger Quincy Promes being denied a 35th-minute goal by a very close VAR offside decision and the midfielder Edson \u00c1lvarez hitting a post in the second half. But this was a well-judged away win with Lampard\u2019s team, inspired by the impact of Pulisic, coming on strong in the closing stages.\n\nPulisic has struggled for games since his \u00a358m summer arrival from Borussia Dortmund and given his status as the bright young thing of football in the United States, there has been plenty of noise from across the Atlantic about his omissions. Lampard has had to blot that out and Pulisic made a statement here, although he was not the only Chelsea player to do so. Kurt Zouma, Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic were also outstanding.\n\nAjax looked to attack, squeezing high and hunting in packs, and Lampard\u2019s men had to show high levels of care in possession, which they did. Their defensive work was placed under immense scrutiny and the first half was marked by moments when Tomori distinguished himself, most notably with a saving tackle on Hakim Ziyech. C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta also made a vital last-man challenge on Promes and he celebrated by clenching his fists. It was that kind of night.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Quincy Promes thought he had opened the scoring for Ajax. Photograph: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images\n\nThe tension simmered \u2013 the assistant coach Jody Morris was booked on the Chelsea bench after he overheated \u2013 and the first flashpoint came when Promes thought he had given Ajax the lead. Ziyech\u2019s shot deflected off Tomori and looped up kindly to the far post where Promes tapped home. His first reaction was to look across at the assistant referee. Everybody did.\n\nPromes had feared that he was offside and off we went for a lengthy VAR consultation. When the first replays filtered through, he looked level. But when the micro-analysis started, the lines showed that he was in front of the last Chelsea defender by a matter of millimetres.\n\nFrank Lampard urges Chelsea to sustain new blueprint after \u2018huge\u2019 Ajax win Read more\n\nChelsea\u2019s best moments of the first half were provided by Callum Hudson-Odoi, who bristled with menace on the left. His pace was a nightmare for Jo\u00ebl Veltman in particular, yet an end product was frustratingly absent. Hudson-Odoi went closest when he went for the near corner on 15 minutes after a slick one-two with Mason Mount, only for Onana to save. There were two other snatched finishes from him while Azpilicueta was guilty of flashing high in the 43rd minute, when he had an option in the middle.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nAjax came within a whisker of the breakthrough in the 59th minute, when \u00c1lvarez directed a header from Promes\u2019s corner towards the far corner. The upright came to Chelsea\u2019s rescue. But Pulisic and Batshuayi would help to turn the tide.\n\nThe former pulled a low shot wide on 81 minutes but ultimately the pair got together to make the difference. When Lampard last visited this stadium it was as Chelsea\u2019s captain for the 2013 Europa League final win over Benfica. This was his sweetest moment as the club\u2019s manager by a distance.", "description": "Chelsea left it late at Ajax but Michy Batshuayi made the difference in a 1-0 victory for Frank Lampard\u2019s side", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe00012d76332ff263bda00361d94135d20f742c/165_149_3764_2258/master/3764.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=07ed739161433568a1792e1637f843c4", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
