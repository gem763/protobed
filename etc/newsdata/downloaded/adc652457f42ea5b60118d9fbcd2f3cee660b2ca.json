Parker will take on the new role of executive chairman and continue to head the company's board.\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting time for Nike where we see brand strength and momentum throughout the world and great opportunity for future growth,\u201d Parker said in a statement.\n\nDonahoe, president and CEO of ServiceNow, is the former CEO of retail site eBay, as well as Bain & Co.\n\nWhat's the best map?

The company's first quarter earnings last month soared past expectations. But Nike has also been plagued by scandals recently.\n\nThree weeks ago, renowned track coach Alberto Salazar was banned from the sport for four years by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency for running experiments with supplements and testosterone that were bankrolled and supported by Nike, along with possessing and trafficking testosterone. Nike announced that it was shutting down its elite Oregon Project track and field program overseen by Salazar in the wake of the scandal.\n\nParker said in a TV interview with CNBC Tuesday that the scandal had \"absolutely nothing\" with him leaving the top job and that succession plans have been months in the making.\n\n\"This is not something that happens in a matter of weeks,\" he said.\n\nLast year, allegations of misconduct and gender discrimination led to a leadership shakeup at the company. And earlier this spring, Nike announced changes to its contract policies after the New York Times published opinion articles and videos from female runners saying they risked losing pay if they became pregnant.\n\nNike shares dipped less than 1% to $95.60 in after-hours trading.\n\nContributing: Kelly Tyko, USA TODAY; Associated Press\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Charisse Jones on Twitter @charissejones\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/22/ceo-shuffle-nike-names-new-ceo-same-day-under-armour/2450170001/", "description": "Mark Parker, who's been CEO of Nike for the last 13 years, will be replaced by board member John Donahoe as of Jan. 13.
