She\u2019s been Betty Boop, Jessica Rabbit, a cadaver, the Garden of Eden\u2019s snake and the apple that tempted Eve, Fiona from Shrek and even herself.\n\nNow she\u2019s letting fans get a sneak peek at her latest over-the-top creation, which she\u2019ll reveal in full on the morning of Oct. 31 from the window of the Amazon store on 34th Street in New York City.\n\nThe German supermodel is once again bringing out the big guns, enlisting prosthetic makeup designer Mike Marino, who has worked on films like Black Swan and I Am Legend. In a video posted to Klum\u2019s Instagram account on Wednesday, Marino can be seen sculpting a mysterious mold that\u2019s bound to be all the rage come Halloween. But what is it?\n\nKlum\u2019s fans have some guesses. Given the figure\u2019s curved headpiece, many have speculated that she\u2019ll be suiting up as an alien \u2014 specifically a \u201cConehead\u201d from Saturday Night Live fame. Marie Antoinette, Cleopatra and Lady Liberty have also been thrown out there, as has the spooky suggestion of Frankenstein\u2019s Bride.\n\nKlum transformed herself into Fiona from Shrek last Halloween.
