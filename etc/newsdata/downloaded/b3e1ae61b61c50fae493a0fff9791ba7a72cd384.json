I suspect it may have been more rude than racist. Not certain how the visitor to the museum on the receiving end of the act would perceive it.\u2019\n\nThe boy was sent home early from the trip, which was meant to last from Wednesday to Sunday, and will face unspecified \u2018school-based discipline\u2019, Clouet said.\n\n\u2018This kind of action is not a reflection of who our students are, or who we are as a community,\u2019 the superintendent continued. \u2018This is not the time or place to talk about consequences.\u2019\n\n\u2018It was an act of stupidity, disinterest, & immaturity, completely inappropriate,\u2019 Principal Dina Marks (left) tweeted Saturday, \u2018but I believe, not racially motivated against that person\u2019. Shelton Public Schools Superintendent Chris Clouet (right) said the culprit responsible \u2018acted inappropriately and embarrassed himself\u2019, adding that, unlike Marks, he wasn\u2019t sure if the act was racially motivated or not.\n\nThe annual event also includes visits to the United State Holocaust Memorial Museum and Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nIn a letter to parents, Clouet urged them to speak to their children \u2018in an age-appropriate manner about our expectation of how we treat people: Black or White, elder or young, or anyone, a child (or adult!) may perceive as being different.\u2019\n\nContrary to Marks\u2019 claims, Greg Johnson, president of the Ansonia Valley NAACP, said the location of the incident is all the evidence needed to discern whether the act was \u2018just horseplay\u2019 or something far worse.\n\n\u2018He didn\u2019t spit on anyone at the Washington Monument or the Lincoln Memorial,\u2019 Johnson told the Courant. \u2018A total and complete lack of respect and one of the most degrading acts one can commit against another.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an embarrassment not only to Shelton, but to Connecticut,\u2019 he blasted.\n\nIn a letter to parents, Clouet urged them to speak to their children \u2018in an age-appropriate manner about our expectation of how we treat people: Black or White, elder or young, or anyone, a child (or adult!) may perceive as being different\u2019 (pictured: A statue depicting USA track and field athletes Tommie Smith, C, and John Carlos, R, as they raised gloved fists during their medal ceremony at the 1968 Summer Olympics)\n\nJohnson highlighted that this is the third incident of its kind involving a Shelton youngster in the past few weeks.\n\nLast month the school district investigated a video circulating on Snapchat which showered a female student in blackface making racially offensive gestures and remarks, caption with a racist slur.\n\nThe students responsible for the video, who have not been named, were made to apologize during a school assembly that included a slideshow presentation about the racist history of blackface.\n\nJohnson said another youngster at the school was caught using the N-word on social media, but was never reprimanded.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no accountability,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s why kids run amok. There\u2019s deeply embedded racism in town.\u2019\n\nAround 35 percent of students in the Shelton Public Schools district are of color, Clout revealed to Buzzfeed.\n\nHe said Shelton schools will reach out to students to teach them about increasingly diverse communities.\n\n\u2018I think my job as an educator is to make sure we're educating our children to live in a multicultural world.\u2019", "description": "The unnamed boy from Shelton Intermediate School spat off a balcony and struck the person below, according to Principal Dina Marks, who was accompanying the students on the trip Friday.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/17/19700618-0-image-a-31_1571070059963.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
