We believe that the labeling of our ice cream fully complies with all regulations and industry standards, and is not misleading in any way,\" a spokesperson for the grocery chain emailed.\n\nThe privately owned Rochester, New York-based grocer runs 99 stores in seven states.\n\nThe suit against Wegmans is reminiscent of another suit filed last year over the lack of ginger in Canada Dry Ginger Ale.", "description": "\"Natural vanilla flavoring\" not the real thing, lawsuit claims, but grocery chain disputes notion its label misleads", "authors": ["Kate Gibson"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/03/21/e01846cb-2cdb-48bb-9e36-ad40dbdf8ae9/thumbnail/1200x630/83193d283c35e4a6b64d3bc4a7e5497d/istock-145853219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
