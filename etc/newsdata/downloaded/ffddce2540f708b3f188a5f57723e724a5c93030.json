(Stacy Zarin Goldberg for The Washington Post)\n\nThis is a good week for bargain hunters. We have an exceptional cabernet franc from the south of France, plus a new vintage of a Portuguese favorite from one of my previous year-end roundup of greatest values. Throw in a tasty ros\u00e9 from an obscure grape variety, a top-notch South African chenin blanc and a splurge-worthy dolcetto from Italy\u2019s Piedmont, and we have a party.\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nLaroque Cabernet Franc 2017\n\nCit\u00e9 de Carcassonne, France, $12\n\nWow! Here\u2019s where we need a \u201cRun, don\u2019t walk to your wine store\u201d emoji. This is a bargain-priced red, made entirely of cabernet franc, that combines some Bordeaux style with the freshness and fruitiness of wines from France\u2019s Mediterranean coast. Look for the dark cherry flavors and white pepper spice characteristic of the grape. Open it at least an hour before dinner and serve it slightly chilled. I was glad I didn\u2019t finish the bottle the first night, because the wine was even better the following evening. One of the best bargain wines I\u2019ve tasted all year.

This ros\u00e9, from a leading Loire Valley producer, is intriguingly delicious, less fruity than the pinot noir pinks of the region, with an herbal, mineral tang that adds to a delightfully refreshing finish.

Flavors of apricot and peach are accented with citrus zest. It isn\u2019t as racy as some South African chenins, but it is soft and mouth-filling with a long finish. ABV: 13 percent.\n\nImported by Vineyard Brands, distributed by Elite: Available in the District at Dent Place Market, MacArthur Beverages, Rodman\u2019s.
