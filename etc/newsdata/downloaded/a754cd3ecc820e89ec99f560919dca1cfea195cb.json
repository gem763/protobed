More than 70,000 people in the U.S. died of drug overdoses in 2017, with most of those deaths related to opioids.\n\nIn response to the crisis, a number of cities have considered opening safe injection sites for drug users. Safe injection sites are places where addicts can use drugs under the supervision of trained professionals who can make sure they have clean needles, give them addiction recovery counseling and provide potentially lifesaving medical help in the case of an overdose.\n\nThere are currently no formal safe injection sites in the U.S., but the push to establish them cleared a major legal hurdle last week when a judge ruled that a proposed site in Philadelphia would not violate federal law. Other major cities such as Boston, Seattle, San Francisco and New York have considered opening their own locations.\n\nSafe injection sites exist in at least 10 countries. Canada has more than 40 locations, though Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s main challenger in this month\u2019s election has called the policy \u201cterrible.\u201d\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nAdvocates for safe injection sites believe they save lives by limiting the risks that come along with drug use. If people with drug problems are going to use anyway, some argue, it makes sense to provide them with a safe venue to do it.\n\nStudies from other countries suggest that the sites reduce HIV and hepatitis C transmission, increase the likelihood that a drug user will seek addiction treatment and \u2014 most important \u2014 decrease fatal overdoses. One large site in Vancouver has reportedly had more than 3.6 million clients inject illicit drugs under supervision by nurses since opening in 2003, without a single overdose death.\n\nOpponents of the sites argue they perpetuate addiction by removing some of the challenges that might push people out of the lifestyle. They worry about an increase in crime in the areas around the sites, since users still have to purchase their own drugs. There is also skepticism about how effective the sites can be, given the limited number of people they are able to help and the massive scale of the epidemic.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nSome of the cities that were considering opening safe injection sites may have been waiting for the court case in Philadelphia to be resolved before moving forward. President Trump\u2019s Justice Department is staunchly opposed to the sites and is expected to appeal the decision.\n\nPerspectives\n\nAdvocates\n\nThe sites bring numerous benefits\n\n\u201cAn abundance of public health research shows that supervised injection sites prevent overdose deaths, do not increase drug use or crime, and decrease dropped syringes in their vicinity.\u201d \u2014 Editorial, Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nSafe injection sites allow drug users to be treated like human beings\n\n\u201cWithin the walls of a safe injection site, people don\u2019t just get protection from an overdose; they regain, at least momentarily, the dignity of safety and self-respect.\u201d \u2014 Michelle Chen, NBC News\n\nThe sites could protect users who may not know what they\u2019re injecting\n\n\u201cThe number of dead is continuing to climb as people overdose on heroin laced with fentanyl. \u2026 That\u2019s where safe injection sites would come in. At more than 90 such locations in Europe and elsewhere, if someone overdoses at one of these sites, a health worker or other first responder quickly administers an antidote.\u201d \u2014 Editorial, Scientific American\n\nSafe injection sites save lives\n\n\u201c...studies have shown that supervised injection sites can drive down fatal overdoses. No one has ever died in one of these sites because there\u2019s someone there standing by if somebody does overdose.\u201d \u2014 Nina Feldman, NPR\n\nA \u2018tough on crime\u2019 approach has been proven over and over to be ineffective\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a hundred years telling these people to go away, to live on the margins, to do this procedure in egregious situations in the most unsafe places in cities. \u2026 These places acknowledge the existence of these people.\u201d \u2014 Darwin Fisher, a Canadian safe injection site manager, to Governing\n\nOpponents\n\nSafe injection sites perpetuate drug addiction\n\n\u201cInjection sites normalize intravenous drug abuse, encourage a horrible addiction, and let down the people who suffer from it. Promoters of these sites offer addicts little but failure \u2014 medical safety at the time of injection but, overall, mere complicity in a nightmarish cycle of addiction leading to death.\u201d \u2014 Andrew Lelling, Boston Globe", "description": "Safe injection sites, places where users can consume drugs like heroin under supervision, could be heading to the U.S. soon.
