The most serious -- the Kincaid Fire -- broke out late Wednesday in the Sonoma wine region, also prompting evacuations.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned that although wind speeds were set to decrease later Friday, they were expected to pick up again on Sunday and Monday in the southern part of the state.\n\n\"It looks like another Santa Ana is coming,\" meteorologist Eric Boldt told AFP. \"Right now, we're looking at moderate strength winds (Sunday and Monday), nothing like what we are experiencing right now.\"\n\nStill, he added, the state remains \"critically dry\" with little humidity, creating an environment ripe for large and dangerous fire growth.\n\nThe high risk of fires has led to preemptive power cuts to thousands of customers and prompted Governor Gavin Newsom to declare a state of emergency in Sonoma and Los Angeles counties.\n\n- 'Story about greed' -\n\nNewsom traveled to Sonoma on Friday to survey areas impacted by the Kincaid Fire which has grown to nearly 22,000 acres and was only five percent contained.\n\nThe blaze, which is burning in remote steep terrain, has destroyed nearly 50 structures and forced the evacuation of the entire community of Geyserville and nearby vineyards.\n\nNewsom told reporters the area looked like a \"war zone,\" with homes and vehicles destroyed.\n\nResidents said they barely had time to gather their belongings as the ferocious fire approached their homes.\n\n\"We looked up the hill and couldn't believe what we saw,\" ranch owner Dwight Monson, 68, told the Los Angeles Times, saying the fire moved 14 miles in five hours before destroying four homes and a barn on his property.\n\nThe state's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., warned that millions of people in northern and central parts of the state could have their power cut off during the weekend given the high risk of fire.\n\nThe company has come under intense scrutiny after it reported Thursday that even though power to nearly 28,000 customers in Sonoma County had been shut down on Wednesday, some of the high-voltage transmission lines were still operating when the fire broke out.\n\nThe same type of equipment was responsible for the state's deadliest wildfire ever -- the Camp Fire in 2018 which killed 86 people.\n\nPG&E, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, has been blamed for several other fires in the state in recent years.\n\nNewsom hit out at the company on Friday, saying it had put \"profits over the people of California for too long.\"\n\nThe governor said it was \"infuriating beyond words\" that a state as innovative as California has to see these types of blackouts, adding that the frequency of fires could not only be blamed on climate change.\n\n\"It's about dog eat dog capitalism meeting climate change,\" he said, referring to PG&E. \"It's a story about greed and they need to be held accountable.\"", "description": "Firefighters on Friday battled several wildfires raging across California that destroyed homes and forced evacuations, as more than 18 million people were under a red flag warning in the southern part of the state.
