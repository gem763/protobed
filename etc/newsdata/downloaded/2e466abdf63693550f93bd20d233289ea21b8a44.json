(AP) \u2014 Peyton Ramsey passed for a career-high 351 yards and two touchdowns, Whop Philyor caught 14 balls for 178 yards, and Indiana became bowl eligible with a 38-31 win over Nebraska on Saturday.\n\nThe Hoosiers (6-2, 3-2 Big Ten) won a third straight conference game in the same season for the first time since 1993 and won in Lincoln for the first time since 1959. Nebraska (4-4, 2-3) lost its second straight.\n\nIndiana players yelled \"We're going bowling\" as they walked into their locker room after the game.\n\n\"Being so far from home, being our first time here at Nebraska, it was awesome,\" Ramsey said. \"It was a fun deal and we're going to celebrate it.\"\n\nRamsey, making his third start of the season in place of an injured Michael Penix Jr., put the Hoosiers up 31-24 with a 2-yard pass to tight end Matt Bjorson on the last play of the third quarter.\n\nKanawai Noa fumbled on the Huskers' next possession, and the Hoosiers went 57 yards for a two-touchdown lead with 12 minutes left.\n\nRamsey, the two-year starter before being beaten out by Penix in the preseason, completed 27 of 40 passes while making Indiana eligible for a bowl for the first time since 2016. Philyor caught 14 passes in a game for the second time this season.\n\n\"It's so inspiring to watch,\" Ramsey said. \"He's a tough little dude. He's a fun guy to throw the ball to. You know you're going to get yards after the catch.\"\n\nNebraska started Noah Vedral in place of the injured Adrian Martinez, and he was helped off the field in the second quarter with an undisclosed injury.\n\nFreshman Luke McCaffrey entered and, on his second series, led a six-play, 74-yard touchdown drive for a 21-16 halftime lead.\n\nDavid Ellis put the Hoosiers up 24-21, and it was tied after Barret Pickering's 30-yard field goal for Nebraska.\n\nThe Hoosiers regained the lead on Ramsey's 2-yard pass to Bjorson, and after Noa fumbled, Steve Scott ran 9 yards for a two-touchdown lead after the Hoosiers converted a fourth-and-7.\n\nMcCaffrey led a quick scoring drive that Wan'Dale Robinson finished with a 4-yard run to pull the Huskers within seven.\n\nVedral returned for the Huskers' final drive, but they turned the ball over on downs near midfield and the Hoosiers ran out the clock.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" Nebraska coach Scott Frost said. \"We've got a lot of guys on this team who really care. We have some guys who are tough and dedicated enough. We don't have enough of them yet.\n\n\"We're just OK right now. I'm not going to be happy with just OK. Just OK can't exist around here.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIndiana: There really is no drop-off with Ramsey at quarterback. He played one of his best games for the Hoosiers, who riddled the Huskers with crossing routes and other short passes. The defense came in ranked 18th nationally, but it struggles when going against better-than-average offenses.\n\nNebraska: The Huskers' defense had no answer for Ramsey, and the offense hurt itself with two turnovers that were turned into touchdowns. Robinson continues to be the most consistent offensive weapon, and JD Spielman remains the most dependable receiver with five catches for 97 yards.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIndiana hosts Northwestern on Nov. 2.\n\nNebraska visits Purdue on Nov. 2.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
