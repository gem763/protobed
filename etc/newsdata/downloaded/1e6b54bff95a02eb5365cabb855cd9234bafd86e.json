Barr appears willing to manipulate the U.S. law enforcement machinery to an extraordinary degree to protect Trump from accountability and to propagandize away Trump\u2019s corruption and likely criminality.\n\nAD\n\nSo one cannot rule out Barr potentially carrying out Trump\u2019s directive to prosecute his political opponents \u2014 the \u201cdeep state\u201d denizens Trump baselessly claims tried to derail his candidacy. Indeed, the Times bluntly notes that this news will \u201craise alarms\u201d that Trump \u201cis using the Justice Department to go after his perceived enemies.\u201d\n\nHowever, it is at least possible that this development isn\u2019t quite as serious as it seems \u2014 and that this might be yet another effort to calm the Audience of One, the Mad King who is raging at everyone for not shielding him from the impeachment inquiry closing in all around him.\n\nAD\n\nConsider: The Times and Post both carefully note that it\u2019s not clear what potential crime Durham and Barr are investigating, how serious it is, or when this criminal investigation started.\n\nAD\n\nAs Cato Institute senior fellow Julian Sanchez notes, this signals the possibility that the criminal matter could be something relatively less serious \u2014 say, an examination of early leaks out of the Russia probe. Putting this out now, Sanchez notes, helps overshadow the impeachment inquiry\u2019s fusillade of devastating revelations, by creating the impression that the \u201cDeep State coup is about to come crashing down.\"\n\nWho do you think frantically wants to create that impression? The Mad King does.\n\nAD\n\nTrump knows this will get worse\n\nThe larger context supplies additional grounds for this possibility. Trump has been raging over the failure of Senate Republicans to protect him from impeachment, and he was cheered when House Republicans pulled their sad storming-of-the-hearing stunt.\n\nMeanwhile, right now, Trump has particularly good reasons for wanting to see more protective actions taken, because the revelations are unquestionably going to get worse.\n\nAD\n\nCNN reports that Tim Morrison, a top National Security Council adviser, will likely confirm key aspects of Ambassador William B. Taylor Jr.\u2019s explosive testimony that Trump withheld military aid to leverage Ukraine into launching sham investigations undercutting 2016 Russian interference and smearing potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden.\n\nAD\n\nThis helps explain why Republicans are increasingly panicked: White House officials privately concede they\u2019re losing the public battle over the inquiry, because it\u2019s producing \u201cdevastating revelations.\u201d Meanwhile, GOP senators are increasingly searching for fig-leaf ways to show the base they\u2019re behind Trump without \u201cdefending his actions.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump feels particularly vulnerable, he\u2019s prone to venting privately at his attorney general \u2014 whom he views as his own criminal defense attorney \u2014 and demanding stepped-up protection against other legal entities, as he did with Jeff Sessions.\n\nAD\n\nSo it\u2019s not hard to envision Trump privately raging at Barr that the investigation of the investigators needs to hurry up and show that the real criminals are those out to get Trump. Presto: Leaks suddenly tell us there\u2019s a criminal investigation, with no indication of its seriousness, its target, when it started, or where the leaks came from.\n\nAD\n\nBarr is deeply dangerous\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying Barr\u2019s machinations aren\u2019t deeply dangerous. They absolutely are.\n\nBarr is at the nexus of everything. Trump told the Ukrainian president to contact Barr to help carry out his corrupt scheme. His acting chief of staff sought to legitimize it by connecting it to the Justice Department\u2019s review of the special counsel probe\u2019s origins. Ambassador Gordon Sondland apparently discussed another version of that same idea.\n\nAD\n\nThe Justice Department keeps denying Barr\u2019s connections to the Ukraine scheme. But this pattern suggests there might be more overlap than we know. On top of all this, Barr\u2019s Justice Department tried to keep Trump\u2019s Ukraine plot buried by advising against the transmission of the whistleblower complaint about it to Congress, and by declining to investigate its charges.\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s more, we don\u2019t know what, exactly, Barr is criminally probing right now.\n\nBarr is traveling the world to validate an absurd conspiracy theory holding that the Russia investigation originated in a U.S. \u201cdeep state\u201d effort to set up the Trump campaign.\n\nGiven Barr\u2019s apparent willingness to place law enforcement at Trump\u2019s political disposal, it\u2019s very possible Barr\u2019s designs are maximally nefarious. But one can also imagine the criminal probe is of some intermediate matter. Marcy Wheeler runs through a few such possibilities, none of which appears all that serious.\n\nAD\n\nRegardless, no matter what Barr does to discredit the special counsel investigation, he cannot make its extensive findings of Russian sabotage of the 2016 election, and Trump\u2019s likely criminal efforts to cover it up, disappear. The same goes for the devastating Ukraine revelations now emerging about Trump. All Barr can do is try to fog those facts over with misdirection and propaganda.\n\nAD\n\nBarr has the power of law enforcement at his disposal to do that, and the implications of what we\u2019re seeing are terrifying. But another way to think about this is that it all leads back to Trump\u2019s desperate panic.\n\nOf course, if that panic mounts, it could make this situation even more dangerous.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Barr's review is now a criminal probe.
