EMP, or electromagnetic pulse weapons, and HMP high-power microwave, use systems equipped with an electromagnetic pulse cannon. This uses a super-powerful microwave oven to generate a concentrated beam of energy. The energy causes voltage surges in electronic equipment, rendering them useless before surge protectors have the chance to react. The aim is to destroy an enemy's command, control, communication and computing, surveillance and intelligence capabilities without hurting people or infrastructure.\n\nPowered by a diesel generator, PHASER can direct a brief jolt of microwave energy in the direction of incoming drones.\n\nThe energy fries the control systems, stopping their motors and causing drones to fall out of the air.\n\nThe US Air Force spent a total of $16.28 million on the prototype, which it purchased from Raytheon and going to run tests until December 20, 2020 in an unspecified location outside the US, Popular Mechanics reported.\n\n'Experimentation includes, but is not limited to 12 months of in-field operation by Air Force personnel against unmanned aerial systems threats,' the contracting notice explains.\n\n'In addition, experimentation includes but is not limited to operator training, in theater maintenance of systems while collecting availability (full mission capable, partial mission capable, non-mission capable), reliability, maintainability and supportability data, and system operation against real-world or simulated hostile vignettes without disrupting other necessary installation operations.'\n\nUnlike lasers, these types of HPM weapons can disrupt or destroy electronic devices across a wide area.\n\nRaytheon says it has already halved the size of the PHASER payload since the experiment in 2013\n\nThe weapon is mounted on a 20-ft. trailer, and can detect and track threats using its own radar or be 'plugged in' to other sensors. The device's parameters can be set to 'disrupt' or 'damage'\n\n'It is a remarkable coincidence because this has been in the works between the Air Force and Raytheon essentially since an experiment at White Sands [Missile Range] late last year,' said Don Sullivan, Raytheon missile systems' chief technologist for directed energy.\n\n'There are fairly recent incidents, for example in Yemen where a very large drone with a high explosive payload killed about 40 people, at a prayer ground of all places. And that was on YouTube,' Sullivan said.\n\n'It was a real eye-opener. What happened in Saudi over the weekend was kind of that raised to the nth degree.'\n\nThe attack in Saudi Arabi happened on September r14 when ten drones launched by Iran-backed militants sparked a huge fire at the world's largest oil processing facility and a major oilfield in Saudi Arabia in the early hours of this morning.\n\nThe fires at Abqaiq in Buqayq, which contains the world's largest oil processing plant, and Khurais, which contains the country's second largest oilfield, have now been brought under control since the drone attacks at 4.00am local time.\n\nTwo days after the attack, crude prices jumped by 10 percent as a result of the blasts disrupting the supply of some 5.7 million barrels per day, or 5 percent of global supply, with experts warning that petrol prices could rise by up to 24 cents per gallon in the US and four pence per liter in the UK as a result.", "description": "US Air Force sending its drone-killing microwave overseas for operational evaluation.
