Tori Schneider, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2013 Investigators in Florida are digging through the ashes of six different crime scenes, trying to determine whether they are connected to a suspect accused of walking into a Taco Bell during the dinner rush and setting a woman on fire.\n\nTallahassee police responded to the fast food restaurant at about 6:15 p.m. Wednesday after a suspect allegedly doused the woman in gasoline and lit her on fire.\n\nThe suspect ran out of the restaurant, eluding police for hours, but was apprehended at about 5 a.m. Thursday after a massive law enforcement search. The victim was taken by air ambulance to a hospital with serious burns.\n\nPolice identified the suspect as Mia Williams, 32. Police initially identified the suspect as a man but later clarified to say that Williams identifies as a woman.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what led to the attack at the Taco Bell. Also unknown is whether Williams was linked to a fire later Wednesday at a church and a string of vehicle fires.\n\nThe Tallahassee Fire Department is investigating a fire at the Providence Baptist Church on Hillsborough Street Thursday, Oct. 24, 2019. The church fire may be connected to three others that occurred in Tallahassee Wednesday night and Thursday morning.

The sanctuary, in the front half of the church, sustained smoke damage.\n\nShawn Peterson, a deacon at the church, said the church has insurance and will pick up the pieces and move on.\n\nThe suspect in the Taco Bell attack has been identified as Mia Williams, 32 years of age, \"who identifies as a black female,\" according to Tallahassee Police.

I do believe that all things happen for a reason and it\u2019s just where do we go from here? Not to dwell on who did it, why it was done or that it was done \u2013 just what do we do from here.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Frank Grimes, who lives not far from the church, said he was awakened sometime before 5 a.m. by a woman yelling outside that someone's car was on fire. He walked outside to find his Honda Accord and his brother's Kia Rio on fire in the driveway.\n\n\"It was like wow,\" said Grimes, who called 911 for help.\n\nWilliams was booked into the Leon County Detention Center on charges of premeditated homicide, aggravated assault on an officer or firefighter and resisting an officer with violence. The suspect is being held without bond.\n\nContributing: CD Davidson-Hiers; follow Jeff Burlew on Twitter: @JeffBurlew\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/24/taco-bell-fire-woman-attacked-police-probe-other-fires/4091265002/", "description": "Tallahassee police responded to the Taco Bell Wednesday after a suspect allegedly doused the woman in gasoline and lit her on fire.", "authors": ["Jeff Burlew", "Byron Dobson", "Tori Schneider", "Jeffrey Schweers", "Published P.M.
