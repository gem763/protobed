We'll pursue any aggressor,\" he said at the opening of an exhibition of captured drones in the capital, Tehran. \"We'll continue until the full destruction of any aggressor.\"\n\nSpeaking at the same event, the head of the Guards' aerospace branch, Brig Gen Amirali Hajizadeh, said the US ought to learn from its past failures and that any attack on Iran would receive \"a crushing response\".\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are an elite branch of Iran's military and have been designated a terrorist organisation by the US.\n\nA game of brinkmanship\n\nAnalysis by Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab affairs editor\n\nIranian officials - both political and military - have issued a series of fierce warnings about any potential attack on their territory.\n\nThe US has adopted a less confrontational tone, but has continued with the Trump administration's policy of applying maximum pressure.\n\nNew sanctions targeting Iran's national bank and the mobilisation of more US troops in the Gulf are all part of this strategy.\n\nWhat seems clear is that this remains a game of brinkmanship, with all sides still hoping to be able to pull back from a direct military confrontation. But the pattern of dangerous escalation over recent weeks does not bode well for this strategy.\n\nThe background you need\n\nThe Houthis have repeatedly launched rockets, missiles and drones at populated areas in Saudi Arabia. They are in conflict with a Saudi-led coalition which backs a president who the rebels had forced to flee when the Yemeni conflict escalated in March 2015.\n\nIran, the regional rival of Saudi Arabia, is an opponent of the US, and tensions between the two have risen markedly this year. The US said Iran was behind attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf in June and July, as well as on another four in May - accusations rejected by Tehran.", "description": "The kingdom says it will take \"necessary measures\" as it reiterates that Iran is to blame.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nzpjf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
