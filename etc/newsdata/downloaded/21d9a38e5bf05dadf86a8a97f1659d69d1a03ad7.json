Al-Rumayyan is also the newly appointed chairman of Aramco.\n\nAramco declined to comment, and the Saudi government media office did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nMBS, the kingdom's de facto ruler, has made the Aramco IPO a pillar of an ambitious economic reform drive. He wants the company to be valued at about $2 trillion, though bankers and company insiders put the value closer to $1.5 trillion.\n\nBanks involved in the offering received news of the delay on Thursday evening. An email from top advisers said that a call with bankers on Friday to discuss a strategy to secure investors was cancelled, as was the Sunday launch, said one banker who saw the email.\n\nThe rationale was that third-quarter results, which one of the sources said could come before the end of October, would bolster investor confidence after the September 14 attacks initially halved Aramco's output and shook oil markets.\n\nAnchor investors\n\nTalks have taken place with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Singapore's GIC Private Limited and other funds, sources have told Reuters.\n\nAl-Rumayyan is pushing banks to achieve the top valuation, said a fourth source familiar with the IPO plan.\n\nAnchor, or cornerstone, investors such as sovereign wealth funds are considered key to secure demand. In 2016, the state-owned Postal Savings Bank of China sold 77 percent of its $7.4bn IPO to such backers.\n\n\"They [Aramco] will want anchor investors to cover no less than 40 percent of the offering. Anything below that won't be enough,\" said one of the three sources close to the deal.\n\nThe latest delay in the plan to hold what could be one of the world's largest public offerings - potentially raising upwards of $20bn from the sale of five percent of Aramco in total - has revived debate on whether Saudi Arabia can ever realise its valuation target given moribund oil prices.\n\n\"The current oil price environment is not favourable for the $2 trillion target,\" said Steffen Hertog, associate professor at the London School of Economics.\n\n\"Aramco expects the oil market to recover over the coming few years. Another longer delay would, however, test the patience of the market; the optics would not be ideal.\"", "description": "Sources say Aramco wants anchor investors to cover no less than 40 percent of its IPO deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/22/d5382553fe954f78a34caa46268800dd_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
