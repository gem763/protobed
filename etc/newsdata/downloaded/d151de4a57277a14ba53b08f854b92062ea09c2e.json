The Taylor testimony will likely show how Trump is actively trying to corrupt our democracy on his own behalf, even as these other new revelations show that in so doing, he\u2019s falling under the sway of other fellow illiberal, anti-democratic autocrats, in particular Vladimir Putin of Russia and Viktor Orban of Hungary.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTaylor, the U.S. charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Ukraine, is a crucial witness because he likely can shed new light on the direct quid pro quo in which Trump froze hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine to pressure its president Volodymyr Zelensky into carrying out his political bidding.\n\nIn those now-notorious texts released by Democrats, Taylor twice objected to what he bluntly described as just such a quid pro quo. As Taylor put it to Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, on Sept. 1:\n\nTaylor: Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations? Sondland: Call me\n\nAnd then, in a Sept. 9 exchange, Taylor said:\n\nAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\n\nAt this point, of course, Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2014 and Trump himself \u2014 had already spent months openly advertising their corrupt scheme to pressure Ukraine to undertake fake investigations to undercut the fact of Russian interference in 2016 and smear potential 2020 rival Joe Biden.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose texts show Taylor believed there was a direct quid pro quo that would exchange the military aid not just for the White House meeting that Zelensky sought but also for the investigations Trump wanted. They also show Taylor believed those investigations were conditioned on that military aid and were all about helping Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 the latter point, of course, having already been widely and publicly established.\n\nThe point here is that Taylor had a reason for believing these things \u2014 something he saw, heard or knows led him to believe there was this direct quid pro quo.\n\nAnd remember, Sondland has not denied that there was any such quid pro quo. All he testified is that Trump told him to assert as much.\n\nAD\n\nThe Axis of Autocracy\n\nMeanwhile, The Post reports that in the run-up to Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky, Putin and Orban held conversations with Trump in which they fed him the idea that Ukraine is hopelessly corrupt.\n\nAD\n\nMick Mulvaney was at the center of this effort, and it complicated efforts by other officials to stave off Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine for political purposes.\n\nThe Post piece paints a picture of a president who is easily manipulated by Putin and Orban \u2014 they prey on Trump\u2019s instinctual attraction to the views of fellow autocrats, especially their hostility toward a country seeking Western-oriented reform.\n\nThe two leaders didn\u2019t urge Trump to see Zelensky as a potential source of smears against Biden. But they didn\u2019t have to \u2014 feeding Trump this line helped reinforce a talking point Trump would use to pursue his own political goals while, they hoped, helping turn the United States against Ukraine: Trump could pressure Zelensky to help smear Biden, while pretending this was only about combating generic \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIndeed, as The Post reports, U.S. officials continue to say Trump\u2019s pressure on Zelensky was mostly driven by Trump\u2019s desire to target Biden and by conspiracy theories fed to him by Giuliani.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s role\n\nMulvaney\u2019s role is fleshed out by the New York Times, which reports that Mulvaney outmaneuvered other officials who wanted to prevent Trump\u2019s meeting with Orban. They didn\u2019t want this autocrat \u2014 who has taken extensive steps to undermine democracy at home \u2014 granted a propaganda coup.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mulvaney himself directly held up the aid to Ukraine only a few weeks after that conversation.\n\nLast week, Mulvaney openly admitted there was a quid pro quo that would exchange the money for the meeting, before unconvincingly taking it back. Yet he flatly denied there was any quid pro quo for the smearing of Biden.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow likely is it that Trump had the meeting on his mind when freezing the military aid, but did not have the smearing of Biden on his mind, after months of public and private obsessing over the Biden/Ukraine angle, at precisely the moment he maximized his leverage over Ukraine? This is an absurdity that Taylor may help dispense with once and for all.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Ukraine did, in the end, get its military aid. But this whole saga helped advance Putin\u2019s interests: As Anne Gearan reports, Ukraine has been \u201cleft to wonder about the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to its national interests,\u201d even as it\u2019s looking for \u201csigns of strong U.S. backing\u201d amid worries about expanding Russian designs.\n\nAll the while, Facebook has revealed that Russia has launched a new round of disinformation warfare against our election. Meanwhile, Trump not only is trying to pressure Ukraine into absolving Russia of its 2016 electoral sabotage; he has openly invited more of it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo what this amounts to is that autocrats abroad and malignantly anti-democratic actors at home \u2014 including Mulvaney, Giuliani and, of course, Trump \u2014 are functioning as a kind of Axis of Autocracy doing all it can to corrupt our democracy, for a whole bundle of reasons. And we may know a lot more about this soon enough.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "New revelations from a witness to Trump's corruption could also help advance impeachment.", "authors": ["Greg Sargent", "Opinion Writer Covering National Politics", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/X1gws5DTsY-7xHGE_fmRRl9BeZg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EQAKS6XR2AI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
