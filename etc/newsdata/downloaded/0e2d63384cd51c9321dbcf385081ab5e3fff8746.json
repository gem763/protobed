Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).\n\nInterviews with nearly a dozen senior Republicans, including top officials and strategists on Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and GOP operatives directly familiar with internal deliberations, reveal the president\u2019s party believes the top contenders for the Democratic nomination are unlikely to change. Barring some unforeseen event that would scramble the current field, the long-term strategic moves are centered around a Biden or Warren primary win.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s election-related moves have been transparent. When Biden\u2019s team launched a $6 million ad buy across Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina calling the president \u201cunhinged,\u201d for example, the president\u2019s campaign was right there to counter the effort, unleashing its own ads targeting the former vice president in the same group of states.\n\nOther calculations have been less overt.\n\nWarren\u2019s rise this summer surprised Trump\u2019s inner circle, who counted her out after her widely panned reveal of the results of a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry following sustained trolling by Trump.\n\nBut as Warren\u2019s fundraising and recent polling occasionally surpassed Biden\u2019s, members of Trump\u2019s campaign and political operation began to see her as a more formidable candidate, even as the odds-on favorite to eventually face off against the president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to notice that Elizabeth Warren has moved significantly in the polls,\u201d one Trump campaign official said. \u201cOur job is to be ready.\u201d\n\nOver the past several weeks, Biden\u2019s campaign has responded with heightened urgency to a consistent stream of attacks from Trumpworld, ramping up significantly in late September, when his team launched a full-throttle effort to discredit the former vice president over his son Hunter\u2019s allegedly improper conduct in Ukraine\u2014claims that have been debunked.\n\nIn a campaign stop last week in Reno, Nevada, Biden sought to further distance himself from Trump\u2019s taunts, insisting, \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d while addressing the president\u2019s disinformation campaign against his son. Shortly after, Trump spontaneously tweeted that he\u2019d love to face the former vice president in a general election matchup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about obliterating [Biden] right now, with the understanding that\u2026Warren is most likely going to soon be the priority when Biden collapses,\u201d a senior Trump campaign aide said.\n\nA Biden campaign spokesman said Trump\u2019s \u201cdespicable actions\u201d speak directly to a fear of facing the former vice president in a general election matchup.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s despicable actions\u2014trying to bully foreign governments into assisting his campaign and spreading comprehensively debunked smears\u2014reek of desperation and speak to Trump\u2019s palpable fear of facing Vice President Biden next November,\u201d Biden spokesman Michael Gwin told The Daily Beast.\n\nTrump campaign spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment on this story.\n\nPolling is a key indicator of which Democrats Trump\u2019s associates and allies consider worth spending time on. A Quinnipiac national survey released on Tuesday shows Warren taking the lead over Biden, coming in at 29 percent to his 26 percent. Her rise is a trend that is reflected in the national averages. The latest Real Clear Politics polling average, the two are in a statistical tie, with Warren at 26.6 percent and Biden at 26.4 percent.\n\n\u201cWe have to prioritize and every few months we look at who makes sense to dig into,\u201d a GOP strategist said about the two-way nature of the race. \u201cBased on the polling, those two are remaining steady.\u201d\n\nAnother Republican aide unaffiliated with the campaign said Warren, who has gained significant traction in the primary since launching her campaign in February, has largely taken the spot that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) once filled. And some Republicans are planning to repurpose the attacks once reserved for him on Warren.\n\n\u201cWarren basically gives you all the socialist policies in a candidate who\u2019s eight years younger,\u201d the aide said, referencing Warren\u2019s age of 70 to Sanders\u2019 78.", "description": "Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Photos GettyAs Democrats compete for the 2020 nomination in a field that\u2019s shown only flashes of winnowing, Republicans have set their sights squarely on the duo they think could realistically earn the party\u2019s top spot to compete against President Donald", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo", "Asawin Suebsaeng"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ff0uThkteZe3zc4w4..XvA--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/f169f0a8a9da9cd18334edfc319667f5", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
