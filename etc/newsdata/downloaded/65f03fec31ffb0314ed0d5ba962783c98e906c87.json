Tim Crockford, of the recently-launched Hermes Impact Opportunities fund, joined us on the Investing Show to explain.\n\nHe outlines how the fund looks for businesses that can contribute and benefit to eight key themes, ranging from water, to energy transition, education and future mobility.\n\nImpact investing backs companies and organisations shaping our future, which could range from water sustainability, to health and electric car infrastructure\n\nThese are the themes that are likely to define the next 20, 30 or 50 years and so impact investing is essentially an investment in the future.\n\nAnd as these are major issues for the world and individual countries, it is possible for investors to benefit from the companies that governments expect to step in and move us towards elements such as electric cars and charging, improving health and wellbeing and transforming the energy system to a low carbon one.", "description": "What if caring about where you invest could make you more money?
