Gillian Robertson at UFC on ESPN 6: Best photos view 10 images\n\nShould fight: Paige VanZant\n\nWhy they should fight: Barber once again lived up to her hype when she steamrolled Gillian Robertson en route to a first-round TKO to remain undefeated in her young career.\n\nBarber made it clear before and after the fight that she wants a piece of VanZant (8-4 MMA, 5-3 UFC) next, and at this point, it might actually make sense for her. It\u2019s clear Barber wants that signature name on her resume, and if VanZant is planning to test free agency after her next fight and potentially on her way out, then that could be a good matchup to send her on her way.\n\nWhatever is said about VanZant\u2019s skill set, there\u2019s a certain cache that comes with beating \u201c12 Gauge.\u201d If the UFC is looking to build Barber up as a star, then it would be a good addition to her resume.\n\nYair Rodriguez\n\nGallery Yair Rodriguez def. Jeremy Stephens at UFC on ESPN 6: Best photos view 12 images\n\nShould fight: Winner of Zabit Magomedsharipov vs. Calvin Kattar at UFC on ESPN+ 21\n\nWhy they should fight: Rodriguez proved his superiority to Jeremy Stephens in their grudge match when he earned a unanimous decision in an entertaining contest that lived up to the hype.\n\nRodriguez has now won eight of his nine UFC fights and has been awarded fight-night bonuses during that stretch, as well. His lone octagon loss against Frankie Edgar is still entrenched in the memory of fans, but one more win and Rodriguez could have some serious steam as a title contender at featherweight.\n\nThe winner of the matchup between Magomedsharipov (17-1 MMA, 5-0 UFC) and Kattar (20-3 MMA, 4-1 UFC) will be in a similar position of trying to get that respect as the next to challenge for 145-pound gold. Pitting Rodriguez against whomever comes out of that fight would be a meaningful fight for the weight class, especially if it\u2019s Magomedsharipov, who \u201cEl Pantera\u201d shares a history with that includes multiple failed fight bookings.\n\nDominick Reyes\n\nGallery Dominick Reyes def.
