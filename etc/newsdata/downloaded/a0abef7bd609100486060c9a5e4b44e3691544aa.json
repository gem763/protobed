Wearing very well.\"\n\nLouise laughed off the comment and thanked Richard, before Judy shot her husband daggers and nodded at the camera.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"It's you,\" she said, gesturing for him to speak to the camera.\n\n\"I know it's me,\" he snapped back, \"I've done this job before.\"\n\nDuring her time on the sofa, Louise also laid bare just how much of a passion project her new album is.\n\nShe said: \"So much has changed in my life. This whole album, all you can do is put on what you feel and what you've been through.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: Dave Benett/Getty Images)\n\nRichard dived head in, questioning Louise about how big an influence on the album her divorce was.\n\nShe was married to football pundit Jamie Redknapp for nearly two decades, with the two deciding to split in 2017.\n\n\"I never went into the album with it being about that,\" she said, \"But naturally when you're in the studio and you're writing and this safe haven, you pour your heart out because that's your safe place.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"I'd say there are definitely songs on the album that aren't bashing, and it's not about being overly personal. It's just how I felt as a woman, as a mother, as a wife.\"\n\nWhen asked what she feels went wrong with her marriage, she said that she doesn't know.\n\nLouise said: \"I wish I knew. It was a really sad time, it was devastating for the whole family, and when there's children involved it's something that takes a long time to get over.\"\n\nEarlier in the show, Richard and Judy introduced the star with a clip of her back in her Eternal days when she first came on This Morning.\n\n\"I was about ten back then!\" Louise joked.", "description": "Louise was sat down with Richard and Judy to chat about her new album when Richard decided to sign off the interview in a creepy way", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Itv", "Dave Benett Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20722644.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_EMP_CHP_251019SLUG_327LouiseJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
