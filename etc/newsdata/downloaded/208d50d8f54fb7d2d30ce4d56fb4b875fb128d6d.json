That daily transaction value dropped below $1 billion in March of 2018 and mostly stayed below $1 billion throughout 2018 and early 2019.\n\nTransaction value broke above $1 billion in May and stayed above that threshold in the months that followed until finally falling below $1 billion earlier this month.\n\nSilver Lining\n\nThe good news for bitcoin investors is that the number of daily transactions has remained relatively elevated, suggesting average transaction sizes are simply becoming smaller.\n\n\u201cWhat's funny is that the number of transactions hasn't gone down at all and actually remains extremely stable around 3.75 transactions per second,\u201d eToro analyst Mati Greenspan said last week.\n\nAfter troughing at around two transactions per second back in April, Bitcoin transaction rates have risen to around 3.68 today.\n\nPeak transaction rates during the bitcoin bubble were around 4.77 per second.\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know for certain why bitcoin transaction sizes appear to be shrinking, but there could be a silver lining to this news.\n\nA 2018 University of Oxford study found that approximately 44% of all bitcoin transactions involved illegal activity, such as money laundering. Oxford estimated criminals make about 36 million annual transactions annually worth about $72 billion.\n\nIn other words, criminal bitcoin transactions average about $2,000 per transaction in value.\n\nAssuming the average retail user of bitcoin making purchases or cash transfers is averaging much lower than $2,000 per transaction, the falling average daily transaction value may simply be a reflection of regulatory crackdowns around the world discouraging criminal activity in bitcoin.\n\nDo you agree with this take?
