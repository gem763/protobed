This was a mistake, and I must take all actions to avoid such a thing in the future.\"\n\nKhashoggi was brutally murdered by a 15-person Saudi hit squad on October 2, 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The prominent journalist was born in Saudi Arabia but lived in self-imposed exile in the US and wrote as a columnist for the Washington Post.\n\nIn the months following the murder, Saudi Arabia shifted its narrative on what happened to Khashoggi inside the consulate, first claiming that he died during an altercation before finally admitting that his murder was premeditated. Saudi officials have distanced the Crown Prince from the killing and denied he had any prior knowledge of the assassination plot.\n\nBin Salman spoke publicly about the crime for the first time in an interview with PBS' Martin Smith as part of a lengthy documentary on the Crown Prince released on Saturday. During the interview, bin Salman acknowledged that he was indirectly responsible for the killing as Saudi Arabia's de facto leader.\n\n\"It happened under my watch,\" he said. \"I get all the responsibility because it happened under my watch.\"\n\nWhen pressed by Smith on how it was possible that he did not know about plot in advance, bin Salman implied that it was difficult to keep track of all government employees.\n\n\"We have 20 million people, we have three million government employees,\" he said.\n\n\"I have officials, ministers to follow things, and they're responsible.\"\n\nBipartisan US lawmakers determined in December that bin Salman was \"complicit\" in the murder. A UN report into the killing published in June of this year said that it was \"inconceivable\" that a sophisticated crime involving high ranking Saudi officials was carried out without bin Salman's knowledge.\n\n\"Every expert consulted finds it inconceivable that an operation of this scale could be implemented without the crown prince being aware, at a minimum,\" the report said.", "description": "Speaking to CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" the Saudi Crown Prince admitted that Khashoggi's murder was a \"heinous crime\" but denied his involvement.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d918d752e22af40731c1063-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
