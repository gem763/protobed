Anna Eshoo and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, both California Democrats, in late July 2018, the book revealed. The Facebook executive also compiled a list of attorneys who Sandberg heard specialized in cases like Ford\u2019s, which was given to a friend of Ford\u2019s through Sandberg\u2019s sister.\n\nFord ended up hiring Debra Katz and Lisa Banks of the firm Katz, Marshall & Banks, which handles whistleblower and employment matters and was recommended by Feinstein\u2019s office.\n\nPincus and Hoffman, meanwhile, lent Ford and her friends their private plane and hired a flight attendant when they traveled to Washington, D.C., for the high-stakes Sept. 27 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which Ford and Kavanaugh both testified.\n\nThe private jet \u201chad been secured through colleagues of [Ford\u2019s] as a way to simplify the travel and avoid public attention,\" according to the book.\n\nIn the lead-up to the explosive Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Pogrebin and Kelly wrote, Ford\u2019s supporters \u201ccanvassed a small group of wealthy local residents to see if they would be willing to provide transportation,\u201d and Pincus and Hoffman offered up their jet.\n\nThe two are major Democratic backers and donated to Hillary Clinton's and Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns.\n\nAccording to the book, Hoffman and Pincus decided to cover the flight because they wanted to help Ford and believed she should \u201chave a chance to air her information.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey also knew well how radioactive the situation had become, given that their own pilots had been anxious to interact with Ford and her friends for fear of being identified and harassed by Ford\u2019s detractors later,\u201d Kelly and Pogrebin wrote. \u201cTo assuage the pilot\u2019s concerns, the billionaires hired a flight attendant to work the trip.\u201d\n\nFord accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her during a small gathering at a house in suburban Maryland in 1982, revelations that roiled Kavanaugh\u2019s already contentious confirmation battle.\n\nKavanaugh vehemently denied Ford's claims. The FBI conducted a supplemental investigation after Ford and two other women accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, though it yielded no corroborating evidence. He was confirmed to the Supreme Court by a slim 50-48 vote in October.", "description": "Silicon Valley quietly got involved in the bitter fight over Justice Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7c1d301/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F2b%2Fb8%2F559f4b3540f28dd403d3e6a8be2b%2Fsandberg-blasey-ford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
