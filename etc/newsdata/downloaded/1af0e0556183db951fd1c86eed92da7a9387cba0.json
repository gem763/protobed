Outside the front door, an elderly woman raking fallen leaves welcomed him like a long-lost friend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to see the postman as I don\u2019t usually see anyone else all week,\u201d said Janine, 81, as Dezeure handed her a tax bill and an envelope addressed to her husband who died several years ago. She ushered him into her kitchen for a chat.\n\nA rural postman politely checking on a lonely elderly person might seem a natural part of French countryside life. But Dezeure\u2019s carefully planned visits to Janine each Monday morning are part of a new strategy for the French post office as it tries to find a joint solution to two very different challenges; the growing number of elderly people living alone; and a decline in letter-writing in the digital era, which means France is looking for new ways to make a profit from its 73,000 postal workers. In 1990, delivering letters accounted for 70% of the state post service\u2019s turnover; in 2020 it will be less than 20%.\n\nQuick guide What is the Upside?

Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?

But some trade unionists have cautioned that people should not have to pay for something that used to happen informally for free. La Poste, France\u2019s publicly owned postal service, says it is using its extensive presence in every corner of France to bring new services to elderly people in isolated areas.\n\nThe service, Watch over my parents (Veiller sur mes parents), was launched last year. Customers \u2013 often in their 50s and living in major cities \u2013 pay from \u20ac20 (\u00a318) a month for postal workers to visit their parents living alone far away. Visits can be weekly or more regular, with a report delivered to the family and an option of a 24-hour helpline and alert system.\n\nAbout 6,000 elderly people are currently availing of the service \u2013 the average age is 82, the oldest is 98.\n\nIn Janine\u2019s kitchen, with her neat display of copper pots and china teapots, Dezeure, 37, who has been a postal worker for 16 years, carried an official list of questions for small talk, including: \u201cWhat did you watch on TV last night?\u201d But he has got to know Janine quite well in their 15-minute chats each Monday, so he improvises. \u201cIn any case I don\u2019t watch TV,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I did watch Out of Africa on DVD last night.\u201d\n\nDezeure said: \u201cShe knows loads about me. We talk about my days playing rugby, my aching shoulders, knees ... \u201d After the chat, he sent a message straight to Janine\u2019s two daughters, in their 50s, who live more than 370 miles (600km) away in the Paris area, telling them she was OK.\n\n\u201cI agreed to do this for my daughters,\u201d Janine said. \u201cThey worry that I\u2019m on my own in the middle of nowhere.\u201d Her package includes a 24-hour helpline and an alert system if she has a problem. \u201cI used to boast I never went to the doctor, but then I had a fall recently. I feel more secure this way.\u201d\n\nShe has lived for 40 years in the same house, built by her husband, and never wants to move away from the secluded spot. \u201cThe radio is a marvellous companion,\u201d she said. \u201cMy motto is: \u2018Turn the radio on, fill the house with sound.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nicolas Dezeure on his visit to Janine\u2019s. Photograph: Elisabeth Blanchet/The Guardian\n\nDezeure sees the human link with customers as one of the best parts of his job. He grew up in this corner of the Vaucluse in southern France and his own grandparents, in their 80s, live on his delivery route. \u201cThe postman is a key figure. People come up to you in the street. We\u2019re always there at the same time of day. People virtually set their watch by us, saying: \u2018Ah that\u2019s the postman, it must be time for lunch.\u2019\u201d\n\nEric Baudrillard, in charge of developing new strategy at the French postal service, said: \u201cNo other postal service in the world has done what we\u2019re doing for elderly people. We\u2019re pioneers on this. People are living longer, and more of them want to stay in their own homes as long as they can. We know there will be more need for social links like this as mobility grows and adult children move far from their ageing parents. Despite all the digital tools that we have, there is still a need for human connection.\u201d\n\nHe denied that the French post office was cashing in on friendly gestures that postal workers had been doing for years for free. \u201cPostal workers always spontaneously and informally connected with clients and looked out for them, and that will continue. But what we\u2019re doing is adding new services and bringing greater value.\u201d\n\nOther schemes have already been rolled out \u2013 postal workers in France can deliver elderly customers supplies from shops, basic prescriptions, books from libraries and hot meals \u2013 though they are paid for by local councils. This week La Poste began offering a service delivering elderly people a regular printout of photos and messages from relatives, which it described as \u201ca kind of Facebook on paper\u201d.\n\nPascal Fr\u00e9mont, from the Sud trade union, who was a postal worker in Loire-Atlantique for 15 years, said he had reservations about the post office capitalising on the silver economy. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s not a problem for postal workers to keep an eye on older people, because many of us already did that. But if it is a paid-for service, that excludes some people who can\u2019t afford it, and affects the notion of public service. We would prefer partnerships, such as with the health ministry. And we\u2019d prefer for any support of the elderly to be funded by the price of stamps. Also, postal workers aren\u2019t healthcare staff, so we should be cautious about that.\u201d\n\nYves Lecouturier, a former postal worker who ran a postal museum in Caen, Normandy, said: \u201cThe social link between postmen and postwomen and the population always existed in France. In the late 1970s, we delivered Monday to Saturday and I remember some older people in remote rural locations subscribed to a daily newspaper just so the postman would come round to deliver it \u2013 that would be the only person they saw.\u201d\n\nAs Dezeure left to continue his morning\u2019s round, Janine said: \u201cI want to stay living at home and I appreciate my adult children want to know I\u2019m OK. It\u2019s pleasant to see the postman for a regular chat, and what choice do I have? It\u2019s this or leave my home.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?
