He was convicted last year on charges related to his political consulting work in the country.\n\nNow, Trump has acknowledged pressing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of directors of an energy company in Ukraine. This prompted a showdown with Congress, as Democrats said they would proceed with a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nUkraine has been a focus of U.S. interest, and recipient of millions of dollars in American aid, since a pro-Western government took power in 2014 and Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and threw its weight behind separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe country has energy resources that have made it a magnet for people looking for business opportunities such as Hunter Biden. It has a messy political scene that has turned it into a lucrative destination for political consultants and lobbyists such as Manafort.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a place where you need political connections to secure your assets,\u201d said Keith Darden, an associate professor at American University\u2019s School of International Service who specializes in Ukraine. \u201cYou get people who are skilled in operating in that environment, someone like Paul Manafort, or someone who can take advantage of that environment like Hunter Biden, and they can make money.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s role in multiple story lines reflects the outsized role billionaire oligarchs play in shaping core sectors of the economy and their ability to offer high-dollar payouts, often with the goal of shaping public opinion and improving the international standing of a country caught in a geopolitical sweet spot between Russia and Western Europe.\n\nUkraine featured in America\u2019s 2016 presidential election because of revelations that Manafort earned millions from his consulting work there and hid the proceeds to avoid paying taxes.\n\nThe country was at the center of the recently concluded trial of Greg Craig, a White House counsel to President Barack Obama who was acquitted of lying about Ukraine business dealings.\n\nA nation of 45 million, Ukraine has long been considered one of Eastern Europe\u2019s most corrupt countries, with powerful businessmen buying political influence and often their way into parliament to gain immunity from prosecution.\n\nZelenskiy, an actor who had no political experience, won the presidential election by a landslide in April, reflecting Ukrainians\u2019 frustration with rampant corruption. He has pushed fraud-fighting measures that include scrapping criminal immunity for lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThey have a very big hole to dig themselves out of,\u201d said Nina Jankowicz, an expert on Eastern Europe at the Wilson Center in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s basically been 30 years of unchecked corruption.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Ukraine is heavily reliant on foreign assistance and seeks to cultivate favorable public opinion in the West to keep the aid flowing, Darden said.\n\nTrump has sought to implicate the Bidens in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. He raised the issue in a July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy that is at the center of the whistleblower complaint now roiling Washington.\n\nHunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings in April 2014, less than two months after Ukraine\u2019s Russia-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych, was ousted by protesters and as Biden\u2019s father, as vice president, was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption.\n\nThe hiring of the U.S. vice president\u2019s son immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration. There\u2019s been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.\n\nUkraine\u2019s leaders have for years pivoted to Russia or the United States, depending on the political affiliation of each new president, and have often tried to use close ties with one country against the other.\n\nIn one of the best-known cases, Yanukovych and his Party of the Regions paid millions of dollars to Manafort. His goal was to promote Yanukovych as a liberal, pro-Western politician and whitewash his attack on political rival Yulia Tymoshenko, who was imprisoned in 2011 following a trial widely seen as Yanukovych\u2019s personal vendetta.\n\nManafort was Trump\u2019s campaign chief when revelations surfaced about his work for Yanukovych\u2019s party and clandestine payments. He resigned and was convicted, during special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, of concealing millions of dollars in proceeds from the work.\n\nThat probe had multiple offshoot investigations. One was into Greg Craig, who was commissioned with his law firm \u2014 for $4 million \u2014 to produce a report on the Tymoshenko prosecution. The government hoped the report would counter international criticism of the prosecution, thereby boosting Kyiv\u2019s international standing.\n\nProsecutors argued Craig helped develop a media rollout strategy for the report and lied about it to the Justice Department. But Craig said he saw his function as simply heading off erroneous spin from Ukraine about his report\u2019s findings and maintained that he never did the Ukrainian government\u2019s bidding or misled the Justice Department. He was acquitted after just hours of deliberation.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time Ukrainian interests sought to shape American opinion.\n\nUkrainian steel mogul Victor Pinchuk, who is married to the daughter of former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, paid political consultant Doug Schoen $40,000 a month to share his views with American policymakers on democratization in Ukraine, according to records filed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\nA December 2016 Wall Street Journal op-ed by Pinchuk said Ukraine needed to make \u201cpainful compromises\u201d to secure peace with Russia. Among the concessions he suggested were setting aside Ukraine\u2019s claim to Crimea and putting its goal of joining the European Union on hold.\n\nPinchuk said in the op-ed he had hosted Trump as a speaker by video link at the 2015 Yalta European Strategy annual meeting in Kyiv and Trump had expressed \u201cgreat respect\u201d for Ukraine. Pinchuk didn\u2019t mention a $150,000 payment he made to the Donald J. Trump Foundation in exchange for the talk, which occurred a few months after Trump announced his candidacy for president.", "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s withholding of military aid from Ukraine and his calls for the country\u2019s new president to investigate the family of a political...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR996_ukrain_ZG_20190925044637.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
