(Chris Helgren/Reuters)\n\nMathematics classes should be for mathematics lessons.\n\nSeattle\u2019s public-school district has proposed a new math curriculum that would teach its students all about how math has been \u201cappropriated\u201d \u2014 and how it \u201ccontinues to be used to oppress and marginalize people and communities.\u201d\n\nA draft of the curriculum, which was covered in an article in Education Week, would teach students how to \u201cexplain how math and technology and/or science are connected and how technology and/or science have (sic) been and continues to be used to oppress and marginalize people and communities of color,\u201d as well as to \u201cidentify and teach others about mathematicians* of color in their various communities: schools, neighborhoods, places of worship, businesses, etc.\u201d\n\nEducation Week reports:\n\nIf adopted, its ideas will be included in existing math classes as part of the district\u2019s broader effort to infuse ethnic studies into all subjects across the K-12 spectrum. Tracy Castro-Gill, Seattle\u2019s ethnic studies director, said her team hopes to have frameworks completed in all subjects by June for board approval. If the frameworks are approved, teachers would be expected to incorporate those ideas and questions into the math they teach beginning next fall, Castro-Gill said. No districtwide\u2014or mandated\u2014math/ethnic studies curriculum is planned, but groups of teachers are working with representatives of local community organizations to write instructional units for teachers to use if they wish, she said.\n\nAs strange as it may sound, this proposed curriculum is not the first time that someone has argued for teaching math in this way. In fact, in 2017, an online course developed by Teach for America \u2014 titled \u201cTeaching Social Justice Through Secondary Mathematics\u201d \u2014 instructed how to teach their students how \u201cmath has been used as a dehumanizing tool.\u201d Also in 2017, a University of Illinois math-education professor detailed what she saw as some of the more racist aspects of math, claiming that \u201cmathematics itself operates as Whiteness.\u201d\n\nI wrote columns about both of these stories that year \u2014 and, at the time, most people likely saw them simply as examples of \u201cfringe\u201d beliefs, confined to only super-progressive, ultra-woke circles. With the announcement of this Seattle proposal, however, we can no longer reassure ourselves that this is the case. Now, the social-justice approach to teaching math has officially entered the mainstream (and taxpayer-funded!) arena.\n\nThis concerns me, and, believe it or not, that\u2019s actually not because I despise \u201cpeople and communities of color.\u201d In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite: It\u2019s because this approach to teaching math will only end up harming the very groups it claims it champions. As The American Conservative\u2019s Rod Dreher notes:\n\nThe young people who are going to learn real math are those whose parents can afford to put them in private schools. The public school kids of all races are going to get dumber and dumber.\n\nGuess what? Minority students are far more likely to attend public school than whites. In fact, according to Private School Review, \u201c[t]he average percent of minority students in private schools is approximately 28 percent.\u201d\n\nIn other words? The minority students, the members of the very groups that this curriculum presumably aims to aid, are actually going to be learning less math than they would have without it \u2014 because they will be spending some of that class time learning about how math\u2019s racism has hurt them. Ironically, one of the curriculum\u2019s goals is to teach students how to \u201ccritique systems of power that deny access to mathematical knowledge to people and communities of color,\u201d and yet, that\u2019s exactly what the district itself would be doing with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe historical contributions of communities of color are important, and students should study them. A better place to study them, though, would (quite obviously) be a history class, not a mathematics one. Mathematics classes should be for mathematics lessons; this is especially important considering the fact that math is exactly where American students (of all races) struggle compared to students in other countries. In fact, according to a Pew Research study from 2017, American students ranked 38th out of 71 countries in the subject. If we want to fix this, we need to focus more on math, instead of looking for ways to teach less of it in the very classes where our students are supposed to be learning it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bottom line is: If Seattle\u2019s school district really wants to help minority students excel in mathematics, the last thing it should be doing is proposing a math curriculum that would teach less of it in the schools that they\u2019re most likely to attend.", "description": "The historical contributions of communities of color are important, and students should study them.
