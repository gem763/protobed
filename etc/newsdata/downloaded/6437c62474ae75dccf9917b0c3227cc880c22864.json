The Internet of Things (IoT) platform links real-time information from cabin components, including the meal trolleys and overhead bins, to crews and passengers aboard the flight in order to create a more personalized - and digitally traceable - experience.\n\nAccording to a company press release, the data consolidated from the platform will be uploaded to the \"Skywise\" cloud service, an open data platform developed by Airbus for the aviation industry.\n\nAccording to Airbus, the platform provides significant benefits for flight crews, which will allow them to access information like meal and seat preferences in one place, and could facilitate remote communication with those on board. For passengers, the system allows for a more personalized travel experience, while airlines would be able to utilize aggregated cabin equipment trends (say, for example, which lavatory is most frequently used during a flight) to perform \"predictive maintenance\" on cabin elements.\n\nRead more: This futuristic Airbus smart seat prototype may make the future of economy flying a bit less miserable\n\nOverhead bins, the company says, could be linked to sensors which indicate to passengers which spaces are free.\n\nThe company has begun trialing the smart system and connected cabin components on its A350-900 Flight Lab aircraft based at its Hamburg facility, claiming it is the first aircraft manufacturer to carry out such testing.\n\nThese include an iSeat by Recaro, which comes outfitted with sensors in the armrest, backrest and tray table, a connected galley area, and a remote wireless cabin management system.\n\nAirbus A320 Smart Cabin Reconfiguration \"Flex Seat\" demo at @recaro_de's #AIX17 booth.

The goal of the system, it says, is to make boarding and in-flight security checks more efficient. The company hopes to roll out the technology not only on its test aircraft, but also on its fleet of A321 planes in 2021, and its larger A350 series in 2023.\n\n\"It's not a concept, it's not a dream: It's reality,\" Wuggetzer said.", "description": "The Internet of Things platform links real-time information from cabin components to create a more personalized \u2014 and digitally traceable \u2014 experience.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9006/2517f9e05e2e4fcebe8963543d26e458.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-02"}
