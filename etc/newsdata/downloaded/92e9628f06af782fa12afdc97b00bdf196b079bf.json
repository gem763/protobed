He completed his schooling and tertiary education in Australia.\n\nSeedat reportedly worked at an Australian accounting firm.\n\nAccording to UK publication Daily Star, Yusuf mouthed \"I love you\" as Seedat used a wheel spanner to beat her to death.\n\nShe was in bed when he brutally attacked her, beating her before suffocating her and burying her in the back garden.\n\nHe had reportedly meticulously planned the murder, searching for \"burying a cat\" and \"burying someone alive\", as he plotted to pursue a relationship with her sister. Seedat had also searched online: \"Can you marry your brother-in-law if your sister is dead Muslim?\"\n\nHired contractor to dig hole\n\nHe reportedly had a hole dug by a contractor \u2013 and claimed it was because he was building a swimming pool for their children. This is where he then buried her.\n\nAfter her death, he reportedly lied to friends and family, telling them she'd gone to the UK for eye surgery. He told his sister-in-law she had left him.\n\nAccording to the New Zealand Herald, Justice Bruno Fiannaca described the killing as brutal, callous and cowardly.\n\n\"It may have been technically clumsy but it was calculated behaviour,\" the judge reportedly said.\n\n\"You envisaged a future with your sister-in-law \u2026 you had become emotionally dependent on her.\"\n\nA Ladysmith community leader, who did not want to be named, told the Sunday Tribune that the family visited South Africa every three or four years to see their relatives.\n\nHe reportedly said that only one of Seedat's uncles, his father's brother, still lived in Ladysmith. The community leader said he could not remember Seedat, as he was young when the family immigrated to Australia.\n\n\"However, I remember the father and he was well respected in the community. Even if you didn't know the family that well, this type of news always comes as a shock to any community.\"\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "A former resident of Ladysmith in KwaZulu-Natal, who murdered his wife so he could have a relationship with her sister, has reportedly been sentenced to least 23 years in a West Australian prison.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6892/129785519f184cc8bd6c8efaacd970c2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-31"}
