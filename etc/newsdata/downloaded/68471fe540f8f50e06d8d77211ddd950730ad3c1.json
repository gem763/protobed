Style-wise, she may largely be remembered for her layered bob, but she nonetheless has inspired a Friends 25th-anniversary collection for Ralph Lauren.\n\nThe clothes themselves aren\u2019t really on-the-nose Rachel, but they are cute and preppy, and include notes of both \u201990s eclecticism and minimalism. The collection features velvet pantsuits, leopard-print coats, and a yellow-plaid miniskirt (which reminds us of another \u201990s heroine, but we digress). A gray, sleeveless, turtleneck midi dress could be worn by either Rachel or Monica, but the purple shearling coat is undeniably Phoebe (although Phoebe would prefer it to be vegan, surely). Sadly for Ross, the only leather pants are billed for women. But there are three varieties of leather pants, ranging from a paperbag-waist style to a skinny pair you might get stuck in.\n\nIf you\u2019re a superfan, there will be a Central Perk pop-up at the Bloomingdale\u2019s NYC flagship store on September 21 and 22. So that\u2019s two of Rachel\u2019s former employers that are honoring her impact on the fashion industry.\n\nReally, it\u2019s a testament to how far you can go in the fashion industry over two and a half decades. It seems like just yesterday that Rachel was lying to her boss about sleeping with Ralph Lauren.", "description": "Rachel Green \u2013 Jennifer Aniston\u2019s character on Friends \u2013 has inspired a Friends 25th anniversary collection for Ralph Lauren.", "authors": ["Sarah Spellings"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/18/ralph-lauren-x-friends/lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
