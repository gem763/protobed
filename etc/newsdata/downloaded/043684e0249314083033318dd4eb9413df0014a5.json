He narrowly managed to maintain power, with the Liberal Party winning enough seats for him to form a minority government. But his Liberals lost both the popular vote and their majority in parliament \u2014 losing more than 20 seats nationwide and winning no seats in Saskatchewan and Alberta. In Trudeau\u2019s home province of Quebec, dozens of seats went to the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n\nSylvia Bashevkin, professor of political science at the University of Toronto, told Today\u2019s WorldView that \u201cthe election results are pretty consistent with popular thinking.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCanadian voters seemed to want to give Liberals the messaging that they hadn\u2019t earned another majority but that they weren\u2019t prepared to cast their futures in the hands of the party from the right,\u201d she said.\n\nA series of scandals and missteps led to a rough campaign season for Trudeau, and his failure to win enough seats to form a majority government offered a stark contrast to the prime minister\u2019s easy win four years ago. In 2015, he swept to power promising to serve as a progressive alternative to his predecessor, Stephen Harper, a Conservative who, after about a decade in power, faced mounting discontent.\n\nAt the time, progressives in Canada and around the globe quickly embraced Trudeau, whose father had also served as prime minister, as the new darling of their cause. He was an environmental advocate and self-declared feminist who named a gender-diverse cabinet and welcomed refugees, even hugging Syrian asylum seekers at the airport as he handed each of them a new winter coat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2017, just six months after President Trump took office in Washington, Rolling Stone printed a magazine cover with a close-up of Trudeau\u2019s face next to the words, \u201cWhy can\u2019t he be our president?\u201d\n\nBut for many Canadians, his charm wore off. Some were exhausted by what was perceived as his excessive showmanship. On one trip to India, he embarrassed many Canadians when he and his family paraded around dressed in traditional Indian clothes, posing for extravagant photo ops.\n\nThen other bits of his platform seemed to start falling apart. Last year, after pushing for environmental progress, he spent $3.4 billion on a controversial oil pipeline. In August, an ethics watchdog ruled that he had violated conflict-of-interest laws when his team pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, to make a deal with engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. Wilson-Raybould, Canada\u2019s first indigenous attorney general, was then moved out of her role, which, The Washington Post reported, was \u201cwidely seen as a demotion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd then, last month, old images emerged of him in brownface and blackface, further tarnishing his carefully crafted persona as a leader particularly sensitive to diversity and inclusion. He apologized, but his critics and opponents said the photos and video were evidence Trudeau was unfit to lead Canada.\n\nAs Canadian journalist Jen Gerson argued in an op-ed for the New York Times, Trudeau may have held onto his seat this week, but the election really should not have even been a fight to begin with. On the campaign trail, the Liberal Party \u201ctried to capitalize on a growing sense of insecurity among Canadians during the election by portraying the Conservatives as racist Trump-lite populists,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHowever bad this tactic made the Conservatives look, it did as much to highlight the Liberals\u2019 key weakness \u2014 that if Canada is facing some kind of ascendant far-right threat, this lightweight who wore blackface may not be the one best equipped to meet it.\u201d\n\nTrudeau declared in his victory speech early Tuesday that he has a \u201cclear mandate\u201d for a second term. But now that he will no longer enjoy the power of a majority in parliament, analysts say he\u2019s set up for what could be a much more difficult run than he is used to.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMajority governments in Canada have phenomenal power,\u201d said Jonathan Rose, associate professor of political studies at Queen\u2019s University. \u201cYou can pretty much enact any bill you want. What\u2019s different now is obviously he\u2019ll rely on other parties, but more crucially, the committees which examine all legislation will now not have a majority.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be much tougher for him to govern,\u201d Rose said.\n\nBruce Heyman, who served as U.S. ambassador to Canada during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term in office, said that \u201cbeing a minority government will force him to constantly work for compromises, for running the budget, for legislation,\u201d and added that minority governments often don\u2019t last more than a few years.\n\nAD\n\nStill, even if it took two hands for Trudeau to hold onto his seat Monday night, his camp still had some cause to celebrate. The Liberals may have been downgraded to a minority government, but they ultimately fared better than Trudeau\u2019s political rival, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who was intent on removing Trudeau from office. As the votes rolled in, Scheer said that even if they didn\u2019t manage that feat, the results show \u201cConservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump offered his congratulations to Trudeau on Tuesday, saying \u201cCanada is well served\u201d by his win. (Just last year, he called Trudeau \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cweak.\u201d)\n\nCongratulations to @JustinTrudeau on a wonderful and hard fought victory. Canada is well served. I look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\nAnd at a time when populist movements are gaining traction around the globe, Canadian voters may have denied Trudeau the strength of a majority government, but they also squarely rejected the rhetoric of Maxime Bernier, a former Conservative who now leads the far-right People\u2019s Party. Bernier and his party didn\u2019t win a single seat. He ran a controversial campaign, at one point facing major criticism after he called Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg \u201cmentally unstable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have been facing this conservative, more isolationist, less liberal democratic order of things, elections taking place and decisions against democracies, globally,\u201d Heyman said. \u201cJustin Trudeau was able to push back against this populism wave.\u201d\n\nCarol Morello contributed to this report.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
