He's very likely (to be available).\n\n'Billy is a very important player to us and a very likeable player as well. He fits well within the team.\n\nThe No 8 is on course to recover from the ankle injury that forced him off at against Argentina\n\n'He loves the ball in his hand. He is very good at regaining and retaining momentum. He likes carrying the ball which is where he has his greatest influence.'\n\nWhile the update over Vunipola has been positive, it appears increasingly unlikely that wing Jack Nowell will play any part in the quarter-final.\n\nHaving recovered from ankle surgery and being forced to have his appendix removed, Nowell's comeback against the Pumas came at the cost of a hamstring injury that has prevented him from taking a full part in training.\n\n'Jack wasn't at training today. He is on another prescription of training and is also progressing,' Mitchell said.", "description": "England boss Eddie Jones names his team to face the Wallabies on Thursday and Vunipola, the only player to have started all 12 of England's Tests this year, will be an automatic selection if fit.", "authors": ["Duncan Bech"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/06/19725598-0-image-a-30_1571118694921.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
