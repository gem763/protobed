Susan Collins and Mitt Romney saying it was a \u201cbig mistake\u201d for Trump to publicly urge an authoritarian regime to open a probe into his political opponents. Trump, meanwhile, revealed during private remarks that he raised the Hunter Biden issue with an intermediary to China.\n\nEven though Trump has privately pushed China to look into a 2020 presidential hopeful and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and other allies have been using China to slime Biden for a while now, some GOP lawmakers have attempted to claim that Trump isn't serious about wanting China to look into the former vice president.\n\nAsked by a reporter on Friday\u2014who also noted that he was one of the loudest critics of China and its human rights abuse\u2014if he thought it was okay for the president to publicly ask China to probe the Bidens, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said he didn\u2019t think it was a \u201creal request.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he did it to gig you guys. I think he did to provoke you to ask me and others, and get outraged by it,\u201d the Florida senator added. \u201cLike I said, he plays it like a violin and everybody falls right into it. It\u2019s not a real request.\u201d\n\nDuring an appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, meanwhile, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH)\u2014one of the president\u2019s most vocal supporters in Congress\u2014embraced Rubio\u2019s defense of Trump\u2019s China remarks.\n\nRepeatedly refusing to answer host George Stephanopoulos\u2019 question as to whether he believes it\u2019s appropriate for the president to publicly call for the Chinese to look into the Bidens, Jordan laughed and asked the host: \u201cGeorge, you really think he was serious about thinking that China\u2019s going to investigate the Biden family?\u201d\n\nJordan also claimed that Rubio had it \u201cexactly right\u201d when the Florida lawmaker said Trump\u2019s \u201cgetting the press all spun up about this.\u201d After Stephanopoulos questioned him on whether we\u2019re supposed to take Trump at his word, Jordan replied that the press still hasn't \u201cfigured out\u201d how the president speaks.\n\nOver on CBS News\u2019 Face the Nation, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) took the same tack, latching onto Rubio\u2019s excuse. Asked by anchor Margaret Brennan if he was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with the president calling for foreign governments to investigate his political opponents, Blunt brushed off the China request.\n\n\u201cWell, I doubt if the China comment was serious, to tell you the truth,\u201d Blunt replied.\n\nBrennan then wondered why the Missouri lawmaker wasn\u2019t taking the president at his word on this, prompting Blunt to sayt Trump just \u201cloves to bait the press\u201d and does it every day to see what the media will \u201ctalk about.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t believe the president,\u201d the CBS host noted. \u201cIs that appropriate to ask for a foreign government to interfere?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t imagine that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Blunt responded.\n\nWhile these Republicans are running interference for the president and rallying around a defense that revolves around not taking the president seriously or literally, Trump has spent the past two days unleashing on Romney for condemning his actions and remarks on China, calling the 2012 Republican presidential nominee a \u201cpompous ass.\u201d", "description": "On the Sunday talk shows, several of the president\u2019s biggest boosters took up a new line of defense: Trump was just kidding.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570379086/week-george-stephanopoulos_11_f5md4w", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
