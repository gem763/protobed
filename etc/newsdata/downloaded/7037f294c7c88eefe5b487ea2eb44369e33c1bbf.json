Trump yet again on Friday, this time becoming the most well-known Republican to condemn the president's actions regarding China's and Ukraine's investigation into Biden family corruption.\n\n\"When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\" the senator tweeted.\n\n\"By all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,\" Romney added.\n\nBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 4, 2019\n\nAs Townhall has documented, Trump is currently being investigated by Democrats as to whether or not he wrongfully pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate shady business dealings between former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, and a Ukrainian energy company. On Thursday, the president also told the media he hoped China would investigate Biden's family as well.\n\nTrump critics assert that Trump is only pressuring foreign nations in this regard because Biden is a 2020 presidential candidate.\n\nRomney's comments come after the president defended his actions on Friday, saying, \"As President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!\"\n\nAs President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2019\n\nAs evidenced both verbally and photographically, Romney and Trump have never had the best relationship. This photo from 2016 sums up their existence quite nicely:", "description": ".10/04/2019 19:48:27PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/277/d43ed22d-a8fd-41b3-9391-d267e8044bb4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
