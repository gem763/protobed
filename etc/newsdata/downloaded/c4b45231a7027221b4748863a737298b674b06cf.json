That means that a potential threat anywhere in the network will be a threat to the whole network,\" then Director-General of the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) Mike Burgess said in October.\n\n\"In consultation with operators and vendors, we worked hard this year to see if there were ways to protect our 5G networks if high-risk vendor equipment was present anywhere in these networks.\n\n\"At the end of this process, my advice was to exclude high-risk vendors from the entirety of evolving 5G networks.\"\n\nBurgess has since moved up to become Australia's spy chief, as Director-General of Security for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO).\n\nBefore he returned to the ASD, Burgess was chief information security officer for Australia's incumbent telco, Telstra. Suffice to say that the new ASIO chief is fully up to speed on the cybers, especially in the telco space, and would be extremely unlikely to overturn a ban that he recommended.\n\nSee also: Huawei: No plan for Harmony-powered smartphone, for now\n\nHowever, Soldari claimed that banning companies would be counter-productive.\n\n\"It actually makes Australia less secure because it means we have to then increase our reliance on just one or two other vendors -- neither of whom are having their equipment tested,\" he said.\n\n\"Unless Australia changes it approach and adopts a standards and certification led approach to security then it will simply sleepwalk into a world of cybersecurity problems in both 5G and 6G for which it is totally unprepared.\"\n\nIt's an interesting piece of mind bending that Huawei is trying to push: By cleaning up its telco supply chain on a nationwide scale, Australia has made itself insecure. Or to put it another way, to fight a particular disease, don't focus on the vaccines, a cure is the only way to win.\n\nA fortnight ago, Huawei Australia chair John Lord really turned up the mind bending when he told the ABC the local arm had legal advice that exempted it from Chinese laws.\n\n\"We are immune. We have two legal opinions that says it does not apply to us,\" Lord said.\n\n\"It definitely does not apply to us outside of China ... we can put our equipment in, it's operated by telcos who are in Australia, maintained by Australians and therefore, there is no way in the world any information in Australia will be handed over to any other government in any country, will be handed over to a foreign government.\"\n\nIf you think that Beijing would allow one of its own companies to refuse its demands under China's national security laws, or American companies would defy Washington during a national emergency, I think you are in the right frame of mind to purchase the Sydney Harbour Bridge: It's only had one owner, and has low mileage.\n\nThe best reason for Australia's Huawei ban was delivered by former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in March, who said it was not done at the behest of another nation or for protectionist reasons, but because it defended Australia's sovereignty and as a \"hedge against changing times\".\n\n\"It is important to remember that a threat is the combination of capability and intent,\" Turnbull said.\n\n\"Capability can take years, decades to develop. And in many cases won't be attainable at all. But intent can change in a heartbeat.\"\n\nAs a western middle power glances around the world thinking about which countries could potentially turn hostile, the chances of China facing off against the west whether in a cyber or kinetic form is many orders of magnitude higher than Finland, Sweden, or South Korea -- the homes of Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung respectively.\n\nIn a world where anyone telling you they know what will happen next week is either misinformed, lying, or both, who is to know what an authoritarian regime in the Middle Kingdom will decide to do, let alone the collection of unpredictable leaders running the Anglosphere.\n\nGiven these circumstances, prudence alone says Australia is better off trusting equipment from Stockholm, Seoul, or Helsinki than Huawei, if only to deny Beijing home ground advantage in our telco networks. It's the same reasoning that would see China glare at American equipment inside of its networks.\n\nZDNET'S MONDAY MORNING OPENER\n\nThe Monday Morning Opener is our opening salvo for the week in tech.
