That\u2019s when he came to visit me in London while we were shooting. He\u2019d be like, \u201cOk, so I\u2019d like you to wear one of these to the premiere\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And I went through the book, and at the time, it wasn\u2019t what it is today. It was not for me. He was like, \u201cYou have to wear the dress\u201d. That was my only bullying. And I was like, \u201cNo, I will not wear the dress\u201d.\u2019\n\nIt seems Jennifer\u2019s insistence on not wearing the dress worked, as she stated defiantly: \u2018Well, what was he going to do? Come over here and make me wear it?!\u2019\n\nJennifer worked with Weinstein on the 2005 movie Derailed (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nWeinstein is accused of behaving inappropriately with multiple women over the course of around 30 years.\n\nStars including Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie have all spoken of their negative experiences of working with the movie producer.\n\nEarlier this month, Weinstein\u2019s former assistant wrote a piece for the New York Times magazine accusing him of attempting to rape her in 1998.\n\nRowena Chiu wrote: \u2018After hours of fending off his chitchat, flattery, requests for massages and a bath, ultimately I found myself pushed back against the bed.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d worn two pairs of tights for protection, and tried to appease him by taking one of them off and letting him massage me, but it hadn\u2019t worked. \u2018He\u2019d taken off the other pair and I was terrified my underwear would be next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018In the end, I was able to wriggle off the bed and leave.\u2019\n\nWeinstein denied all allegations and claimed they had a consensual \u2018six-month physical relationship\u2019.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
