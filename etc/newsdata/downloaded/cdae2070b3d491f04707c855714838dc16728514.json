(Because digital companies don\u2019t require a physical presence to run their business within a certain country, they benefit from the current system, which taxes them based on the location of their operations and assets, not where their sales are generated).\n\nAccording to a recent European Union report, digital companies pay, on average, half of what their traditional brick-and-mortar counterparts do in taxes \u2014 even as their revenue expands four times as fast as revenue for other multinational companies.\n\n\u201dFailure to reach [an] agreement by 2020 would greatly increase the risk that countries will act unilaterally, with negative consequences on an already fragile global economy,\u201d OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurr\u00eda said in a statement. \u201cWe must not allow that to happen.\u201d\n\nThe proposal was sent to G-20 finance ministers ahead of their meeting in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 17-18.\n\nEarlier this year, the OECD agreed to rewrite the tax rules that date back to the 1920s at the urging of more than 130 countries and territories, according to Reuters.\n\nThe proposal comes at a critical time as countries look to impose their own taxes on digital companies in the interim.\n\nFrance has been particularly vocal about the need for a digital services tax; over the summer, President Emmanuel Macron signed a law \u2014 targeting a slew of big tech companies based in the U.S. \u2014 imposing a 3 percent tax on companies worth at $834 million globally and $27.5 million in France. (France said the tax is temporary until the OECD determines how to tax digital companies.)\n\nThe move sparked ire from the Trump administration, which suggested it \u201cunfairly\u201d targeted the U.S.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "One of the proposals would allow countries to tax digital companies based on sales, rather than physical presence.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/tech-logos-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
