The United States, European powers and Saudi Arabia have blamed the attacks on Iran, which denies involvement. Instead, Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed responsibility.\n\nMbS also said President Donald Trump should meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to craft a new deal on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program and regional activities.\n\nEfforts to bring the two together last week at the United Nations failed. Tensions between Washington and Tehran escalated after the U.S. withdrew last year from a 2015 nuclear deal and reinstated sanctions against Tehran.\n\n\u2018ABSOLUTELY NOT\u2019\n\nDays before the anniversary of Khashoggi\u2019s murder, MbS said: \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d when asked if he had ordered it. But he said he took full responsibility \u201csince it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman speaks with correspondent Norah O'Donnell during an interview on Tuesday with the CBS program \"60 Minutes,\" in Saudi Arabia, in this handout photo released on September 29, 2019.

And I must take all actions to avoid such a thing in the future.\u201d\n\nThe CIA and some Western governments believe MbS ordered the killing, but Saudi officials have repeatedly said he had no role. Asked about the CIA assessment, MbS asked for \u201csuch information\u201d to be revealed.\n\nAfter initial denials, the official Saudi narrative blamed the murder on rogue operatives. The public prosecutor said then-deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Asiri ordered the repatriation of Khashoggi, a royal insider who became an outspoken critic, but the lead negotiator ordered him killed after discussions for his return failed.\n\nAsked how the killing could have happened without him knowing about it, MbS said: \u201cSome think that I should know what 3 million people working for the Saudi government do daily? It\u2019s impossible that the 3 million would send their daily reports to the leader or the second highest person in the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nEleven Saudi suspects have been put on trial in secretive proceedings. A U.N. report called for MbS and other senior Saudi officials to be investigated. Asiri and Saud al-Qahtani, a senior adviser, were fired over involvement in the operation. Asiri is standing trial, but Qahtani is not.\n\nAsked how those two members of his inner circle could have been involved without him knowing, MbS said: \u201cToday the investigations are being carried out. And once charges are proven against someone, regardless of their rank, it will be taken to court, no exception made.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, where he was to receive papers ahead of his wedding. His body was dismembered and removed from the building. His remains have not been found.\n\nAsked about prominent women activists who have been detained on charges related to human rights work and tarred by local media as traitors, including Loujain al-Hathloul, MbS said: laws \u201cmust be respected, until they are reformed.\u201d\n\nHe said it was up to the public prosecutor to release Hathloul but that he would personally follow up on accusations she had been tortured in prison.\n\nAsked about criticism of Riyadh in the U.S. Congress over the Khashoggi killing, the activists\u2019 arrests and the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen, which has taken a huge civilian toll, MbS said: \u201cThe (U.S.-Saudi) relationship is much larger than that.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman speaks with correspondent Norah O'Donnell during an interview on Tuesday with the CBS program \"60 Minutes,\" in Saudi Arabia, in this handout photo released on September 29, 2019.
