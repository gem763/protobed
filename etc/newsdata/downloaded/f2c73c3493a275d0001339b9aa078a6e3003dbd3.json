They have been fighting Turkey for decades,\u201d Trump wrote in a series of tweets. \u201cI held off this fight for ... almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.\u201d\n\nThe White House announced Turkey's planned invasion in a statement late Sunday that seemed to indicate at least tacit American support.\n\nTrump talked to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey about the military incursion, the White House said in its statement. The administration, without elaborating on the scope of the attack, referred to the invasion as a \u201clong-planned operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \u2018Caliphate,\u2018 will no longer be in the immediate area,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\"WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN\" \u2014 Donald Trump\n\nTurkey has been a U.S. ally in efforts to battle ISIS in the region \u2014 Syria being the location of much of the fighting because of the horrific chaos of its ongoing civil war \u2014 but there are complications to the alliance.\n\nKurdish soldiers had also been working with American forces in Syria, but Turkey regards those forces as its enemy. The Kurdish forces, which have been fighting for an independent homeland for Kurds, could be in serious jeopardy when Turkish troops sweep into the area.\n\nErdogan has expressed displeasure with the support the United States has given those Kurdish forces.\n\nThe White House used its statement to ding its European allies.\n\n\u201cThe United States Government has pressed France, Germany, and other European nations, from which many captured ISIS fighters came, to take them back, but they did not want them and refused. The United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer,\u201d it said. \u201cTurkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years.\u201d\n\nTrump and Erdo\u011fan are to meet in Washington at some point in the coming weeks.", "description": "\u2018We will fight where it is to our benefit, and only fight to win.\u2019", "authors": ["David Cohen", "Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178817176-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
