They were snapped last year in LA\n\n'That was just the fight at Katsuya,' Apatow said. 'You should have heard the rest of it at Pinkberry.'\n\nThe Hollywood couple initially crossed paths on the set of the Jim Carrey film The Cable Guy, which Apatow produced, and Mann has since been in a number of his most memorable films, including The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up and This Is 40.\n\nApatow, who celebrated his 22nd anniversary with Mann this past June, was asked about the key to a decades-long union with Vice in 2017, and said that 'it's easier if you marry Leslie.'\n\nHe added: 'That's advice that's harder for others to take, I guess. We get up on Sunday mornings and we watch Oprah's SuperSoul Sunday and it cleanses us, we learn things and then we try to apply them and then by the end of the week, we've forgotten everything we saw and we watch a new one.'\n\nEven flow: The filmmaker was snapped at a Malibu fundraiser earlier this month\n\nHappy in Hollywood: The couple of 22 years was snapped at a Laker game earlier this year\n\nApatow is currently working on the film Staten Island with Pete Davidson, which will detail the death of the comic's firefighter father on September 11, 2001, and Pete's subsequent climb up the comedy ladder.\n\nApatow wrapped production in August on the film, taking to Instagram with a shot of himself and the Saturday Night Live star - who was in the headlines continuously last year amid his romance with singer Ariana Grande - posed with New York firefighters.\n\n'Today we wrap our film!' Apatow wrote. 'What an incredible experience. Thank you Pete Davidson for trusting me to collaborate on this story and to our amazing cast, crew and firefighting community!'\n\nThe movie, due out next year, co-stars Marisa Tomei, Ricky Velez, Steve Buscemi, Bill Burr, Maude Apatow and Davidson confidante Machine Gun Kelly.\n\nComing soon: Apatow is currently working on the film Staten Island with Pete Davidson", "description": "Apatow celebrated his 22nd anniversary with Mann this past June.
