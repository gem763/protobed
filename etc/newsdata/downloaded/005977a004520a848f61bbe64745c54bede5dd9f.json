And the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the episode would \u201cfeed people\u2019s dislike and distrust of the EU\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis arrogant and ill-mannered behaviour betrays your motives,\u201d the MP tweeted.\n\nGiven the gap between the European commission and Johnson\u2019s government in the Brexit talks, sources in Brussels said the British prime minister would eventually need to shift on his red lines, and that it could be a tougher job if disdain for the EU among Tory MPs was fuelled.\n\nThe chair of the Bundestag\u2019s foreign affairs committee, Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, who is a senior member of Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party, tweeted: \u201cXavier Bettel\u2019s speech yesterday did not serve the European cause. His public venting ignored that a deal is still in everyone\u2019s interest.\n\n\u201cEven without a deal there will be a post-Brexit life, which means that right now everyone needs to behave in a way that avoids animosity.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:20 Luxembourg PM mocks Boris Johnson after PM skips press conference \u2013 video\n\nThe EU and the UK have agreed to intensify negotiations, with the two sides due to meet daily rather than bi-weekly from next week.\n\nJohnson spoke to the German chancellor on Tuesday, saying there was a need to \u201caccelerate efforts to reach a deal without the backstop, which the UK parliament could support, and that we would work with energy and determination to achieve this ahead of Brexit on 31 October\u201d, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said.\n\nBut there remain grave doubts in Brussels that the UK has an alternative to the Irish backstop that can both satisfy the EU and secure the support of a majority in the British parliament.\n\nOne senior EU diplomat said: \u201cNo one knows what the UK in the end wants, no one knows whether that\u2019s acceptable to us and no one knows how he\u2019s getting the numbers.\u201d\n\nIn the light of what EU officials described as \u201cwide of the mark\u201d press reports suggesting there had been good progress in recent talks, there was some suspicion that Johnson was working to trap the EU in a \u201cblame game\u201d.\n\nA diplomatic source said: \u201cIt was discourteous of Bettel, but a British prime minister as we once knew them would have braved it and probably even turned it to his advantage.\n\n\u201cThe main problem is that this only reinforces the \u2018them v us\u2019 narrative that Johnson has used before, and whilst the continental press rejoices, it will not do him any harm. A leader of a bigger country would not have used such an important occasion to better his own profile.\n\nProfile Who is Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel? Show Hide Xavier Bettel has been prime minister of Luxembourg since 2013. He was previously the mayor of Luxembourg City. Born in Luxembourg City in 1973, he studied law at university in both France and Greece, and combined working as a barrister with his political career. Bettel was first elected to municipal office in 1999, representing Luxembourg\u2019s centre-right Democratic party. In 2018 he became the first openly gay prime minister in the world to be re-elected for a second term. He married his husband, Gauthier Destenay, in May 2015, five months after his government had legalised equal marriage.

So this is how he perceived the meeting up until then.\u201d\n\nEU sources close to the talks paint a less dramatic picture behind closed doors, where Juncker; the chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his officials schooled Johnson in EU law on food, animal and plant health. EU insiders think the Luxembourg lunch neither advanced nor diminished the chances of a deal, but was a logical part of the process \u2013 a process where the endgame is still up in the air.\n\nThe meeting has raised expectations of an embryonic deal in the works, involving a rebranded Northern-Ireland only backstop, as the UK moves towards an all-Ireland food and agricultural zone. \u201cThere is the credible kernel of a deal that isn\u2019t there yet, but could be there by mid-October,\u201d an EU source said.\n\nBut others point to the enormous gulf between the two sides on numerous questions, above all whether Johnson could accept Northern Ireland remaining in a customs union with the EU.\n\nAny revamped deal is also likely to include a less ambitious statement on future EU-UK relations, but it is unclear whether such a watered-down political declaration would command support of Labour MPs, if it seen as stripping away workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections.\n\nJohnson is due to talk to Merkel and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, about his latest Brexit proposals at the United Nations general assembly in New York next week. But there is no expectation in Brussels of written solutions being tabled until after the Conservative party conference the following weekend.", "description": "EU politicians fear disdain may make it harder for UK leader to move Tory MPs on red lines", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a61e0aa479e6a64acc90a33fb69773f5483f1214/0_166_4140_2485/master/4140.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2efaa1f5c721f55fbdcbde21123eb2d9", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
