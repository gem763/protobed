If there is light at the end of the tunnel later this week, and heaven knows I hope there will be, we have a fundamental responsibility in this place to try and resolve this most vexed of problems and allow our despairing country to move on. For the health of our democracy and to restore faith in this most venerable of institutions, in my view we simply must get Brexit done.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeveral of the \u201cSpartans\u201d are now on Johnson\u2019s payroll with government jobs, such as Priti Patel, the home secretary, who is understood to be prepared to support whatever the prime minister brings back from Brussels.\n\nAnother of the Tories who voted against May\u2019s deal told the Guardian that he would be reassured if the DUP backed the prime minister but could end up voting for it regardless. \u201cWhatever the prime minister comes back with, I\u2019m going to have a very long and pragmatic look at it. I think a second referendum would be a disaster and I don\u2019t think our democracy could stand that,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a video for the Stand Up for Brexit campaign, Steve Baker, one of the most fervent Eurosceptics, sounded positive about the potential for a deal he could vote for. \u201cMost of us, including me, overwhelmingly want a deal \u2026 we have got to be capable of getting there through a withdrawal agreement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe problem with the previous withdrawal agreement is it was capable of leaving us trapped in the orbit of the EU, a declining satellite of the EU with no benefits from leaving. Boris has had a dramatic shift towards a free trade agreement that would leave us a self-governing nation \u2026 So now really, the devil is in the detail \u2026 I am really looking forward to being able to vote for a tolerable deal but, until we get the text, I cannot tell you what we are going to do.\u201d\n\nOthers have sounded more sceptical, such as the former Northern Ireland secretary Owen Paterson, who criticised the EU for demanding more and more concessions.\n\nSeveral DUP MPs sound unconvinced, but Johnson may not need their votes if he can secure enough support among Labour MPs and retain the support of his own party plus most former Tories who want a deal rather than a second referendum.\n\nAbout 18 Labour MPs signed a letter last week urging the EU to work day and night towards a deal, saying their votes would be decisive in whether it got through parliament. Melanie Onn, a Labour backbencher, has said she would support a \u201creasonable deal\u201d and wrote on her Facebook page on Monday: \u201cA no-deal Brexit would hinder not help the town and people of Grimsby. I will vote for a deal in the best interests of Great Grimsby to ensure a no-deal Brexit is prevented.\u201d\n\nOthers who have indicated they could now be prepared to vote for a deal with the right reassurances on Northern Ireland, workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections include Stephen Kinnock, Gareth Snell and Ruth Smeeth. Gloria De Piero has said she will look at any new deal seriously.\n\nHowever, they are likely to face fierce opposition from some of their pro-remain Labour colleagues and possible calls for the whip to be withdrawn.\n\nIt is likely to become clear within the next few days whether it will be possible for a deal to be done at Thursday\u2019s European summit and it could drag on until next week. The government will have to table a motion in parliament by Wednesday if it wants to convene MPs for a Saturday sitting to debate any agreement.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman would not confirm whether it would hold the first Saturday sitting since the Falklands war if Brussels talks failed to find an agreement. \u201cThe point here is, for example if a deal is done at European council, a Saturday sitting would certainly allow you to start the process of getting the deal through,\u201d he said.", "description": "Eurosceptics and Labour MPs indicate they could back prime minister\u2019s deal if he clinches agreement in Brussels", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cefad52eee280bf83d6fca5ed0537082c425fa71/0_156_2758_1655/master/2758.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9490581aeaa0ab9338f36916167c9cba", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
