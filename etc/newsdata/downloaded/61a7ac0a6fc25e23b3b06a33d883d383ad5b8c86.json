Then it started getting into the news more and more and I was like 'Wow, this is unbelievable'.\"\n\n'I really didn't care'\n\nBut not everyone interviewed by CBC News in St. James Town in Toronto shared Vanderwyck's views.\n\n\"Personally for me, I really didn't care,\" said Lance Manning, who works in the area but lives in Brampton. \"Some of my friends were really offended, but when it comes to my mindset, I focus on intent. How he dressed, was there any malicious thought behind it? And my conclusion is, that it isn't.\"\n\nLance Manning said he wasn't offended by the pictures. (Michael Wilson/CBC)\n\nTrudeau has publicly apologized twice since three pictures and a video of him in either brownface or blackface have come to light.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Time magazine published an article showing Trudeau wearing brownface makeup and a turban for a 2001 Arabian Nights gala at the Vancouver private school where he taught. Since then, CBC News obtained another photo of Trudeau from that event.\n\nMeanwhile, another picture shows Trudeau at a talent show when he was in high school, wearing black makeup and singing the Banana Boat Song (Day-O), a Jamaican folk tune made famous by black American singer Harry Belafonte\n\n'Making things hard on himself'\n\nThen, on Thursday, the Liberal Party confirmed Trudeau appeared in a short amateur video in blackface.\n\nManning hadn't seen that image of Trudeau, until shown it by CBC News.\n\n\"Oh boy,\" he said, after studying the image. \"He's making things hard on himself. He definitely should be more mindful of that kind of stuff.\"\n\nWhile he's still undecided as to who he will vote for and has voted Liberal in the past, Manning said the pictures won't likely affect his decision.\n\n\"I like the Liberal party, I like the Trudeau family. His father did a lot for the black community and immigrants migrating to Canada, so I take all that stuff into consideration.\n\n\"Will do more researching, but I'm always open to forgiving. People make mistakes in life.\"\n\nMuhammad Suhail, shown the pictures for the first time, said he couldn't understand why the photos have generated so much condemnation. (Michael Wilson/CBC)\n\nMuhammad Suhail, shown the pictures for the first time, said he couldn't understand why they had generated so much controversy and condemnation.\n\n\"Why are people upset from that? Maybe he was trying to play, like an actor on stage. I'm OK with that.\"\n\nBhavani Mohanadhas also said that she believes Trudeau is a \"good Liberal\" and that she doesn't feel he's \"doing any racism\".\n\nI have been following [him]. He is everywhere supporting other people, different races.\"\n\nBhavani Mohanadhas said she doesn't believe that Trudeau is a racist. (Michael Wilson/CBC)\n\nBrooks Smith said he was surprised by Trudeau's past behaviour, calling it \"a little disgracing.\"\n\n\"That really hurts, that really hurt, because I'm black. And you'd think he''d have more sense than that. You'd think he'd be a little smarter than that.\"\n\nStill vote for Trudeau\n\nBut Smith said he will still vote for Trudeau, that people make mistakes when they're younger.\n\n\"If this were recently, I'd feel more against him.\"\n\nBrooks Smith said Trudeau's past behaviour was 'a little disgracing' but he will still vote for the Liberal leader. (Michael Wilson/CBC)\n\nHowever, Andrew Ravindran wasn't as forgiving, saying that when he learned the news from Facebook, it was an \"Are you kidding me?\" moment.\n\nHe said he believes many people continue to dress in \"Arabian Night\" or Aladdin costumes.\n\nIt's really annoying,\"he said. \"I 'm brown so it's a little hard to be used to it. It's just stupid.\"\n\nRavindran said he believes Trudeau has likely learned his lesson, but should have known better.\n\nAsked to explain why he found Trudeau's brownface costume so offensive, Ravindran gave a succinct answer:\n\n\"He's not brown.\"", "description": "Some were offended, others not so much.
