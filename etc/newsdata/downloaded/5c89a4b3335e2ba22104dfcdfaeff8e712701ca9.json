For the week, it was up 1.6% and was on track to post its first gain in three weeks.\n\nThe broader Topix added 0.5% to 1,589.14, also marking its highest since Oct. 2.\n\nTop U.S. and Chinese negotiators wrapped up a first day of trade talks in more than two months on Thursday, as business groups expressed optimism the two sides might be able to de-escalate a trade war and delay a U.S. tariff hike scheduled for next week.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told reporters that his team had a \"very, very good negotiation\" with China, and reiterated his plans to meet with Liu at the White House on Friday.\n\nAs the retail sector's June-August earnings season got under way in Japan, notable movers include Seven & I Holdings and Fast Retailing.\n\nSeven & I jumped 5.4% to hit its highest since late March after announcing massive restructuring plans, including job cuts and store closures.\n\nNikkei-heavyweight Fast Retailing Co climbed 3.4% as the operator of Uniqlo chain booked a record annual profit for a third consecutive year on strong sales in China and forecast further growth in the current business year through August.\n\nBucking the overall firmness, Yaskawa Electric Corp , a bellwether for manufacturing trends, shed 2.5% after the motor and factory-robot maker slashed its full-year operating profit forecast.
