I enjoyed making my city run well.\u201d\n\nThis conscientious approach gave him a boost in a class on local government. Instead of writing a term paper about three different models for how cities can develop, Baker proposed building three scenarios in \u201cSimCity,\u201d then letting the game run on its own and writing about how his virtual cities fared.\n\nHe ended up getting an A. Playing \u201cSimCity,\u201d Baker said, \u201chelped remind me of the importance of local government, which is what I ended up doing for a living.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, Baker is the vice president of transportation and housing at the nonprofit Silicon Valley Leadership Group. He served as a council member in Campbell, Calif., from 2008 to 2016, a tenure that included two stints as mayor.\n\nThirty years ago, Maxis released \u201cSimCity\u201d for Mac and Amiga. It was succeeded by \u201cSimCity 2000\u201d in 1993, \u201cSimCity 3000\u201d in 1999, \u201cSimCity 4\u201d in 2003, a version for the Nintendo DS in 2007, \u201cSimCity: BuildIt\u201d in 2013 and an app launched in 2014.\n\nAlong the way, the games have introduced millions of players to the joys and frustrations of zoning, street grids and infrastructure funding \u2014 and influenced a generation of people who plan cities for a living. For many urban and transit planners, architects, government officials and activists, \u201cSimCity\u201d was their first taste of running a city. It was the first time they realized that neighborhoods, towns and cities were things that were planned, and that it was someone\u2019s job to decide where streets, schools, bus stops and stores were supposed to go.\n\nBitten by the city-building bug\n\n\u201cI used to draw maps of cities for fun. I had no idea it was an actual career,\u201d said Nicole Payne, now a program official for the National Assn. of City Transportation Officials in New York City. When she was 10, a librarian saw her drawings and told her there was a video game she should try.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without \u2018SimCity,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nA scene from \u201cSimCity 2000,\u201d which was released in 1993. (Maxis)\n\nCuong Trinh played \u201cSimCity\u201d in a summer school class in junior high. Years later, after getting his undergraduate degree, he wanted to travel but because he was under 25, he had to rule out cities where he would need to rent a car to get around.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what really got me thinking about urban planning and \u2018SimCity,\u2019 where you put in trains, where you help people move,\u201d said Trinh, now acting senior transportation planner for Caltrans in downtown L.A.\n\nIn more than a dozen interviews for this article, people who went from \u201cSimCity\u201d enthusiasts to professional planners talked about what they liked about the game: The way you can visualize how a single change affects a whole city. The ability to see how transit, livability and the economy are all connected. The fact that no one likes to live near a landfill.\n\nLike Baker, many of the players who went on to become planners generally said they didn\u2019t like to activate the game\u2019s built-in \u201cdisaster\u201d mode, which unleashes earthquakes, hurricanes or Godzilla on cities. They got satisfaction from building pristine cities so efficient they could run themselves.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without \u2018SimCity.\u2019 Nicole Payne\n\nSimplified simulations\n\nWill Wright, the creator of \u201cSimCity,\u201d imagined when he designed the game that it would be interesting only to architects and city planners. But the first version wound up selling more than 1 million copies and changing the nature of gaming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt popularized the simulation game genre and turned Maxis \u2014 a start-up launched in Orinda, Calif., by Wright and Jeff Braun \u2014 into an industry titan. Maxis capitalized on the game\u2019s success, publishing \u201cSimAnt,\u201d \u201cSimFarm,\u201d \u201cSimEarth,\u201d \u201cSimTower,\u201d \u201cSimLife,\u201d \u201cSimIsle\u201d and \u201cSimHealth\u201d in its first decade, along with a handful of less popular non-simulation titles.\n\nThe company was valued at $125 million by the time it was acquired by EA in 1997. In 2000, the Redwood City studio released \u201cThe Sims,\u201d which became one of the bestselling video games of all time.\n\nLike most video games based on real-world jobs, \u201cSimCity\u201d oversimplifies some of the more mundane elements of urban planning. The game has never allowed mixed-use space. (In other words, the ubiquitous mid-rise apartment building with ground-floor commercial space currently taking America\u2019s cities by storm does not exist.) There are no bike lanes. No iteration of \u201cSimCity\u201d has ever accurately depicted the staggering amount of a city\u2019s square footage that\u2019s spent on parking lots.\n\nThe lead designer of the 2013 version, Stone Librande, lent some insight in an article in the Atlantic: Parking lots are ugly and boring.\n\nWill Wright, the creator of \u201cSimCity\u201d and \u201cThe Sims,\u201d at Maxis Studios in Walnut Creek, Calif., in 2004. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press)\n\n\u201cThat is a damning indictment, less of the game and more of urban planning,\u201d said Aaron Brown, a community organizer and transportation activist based in Portland, Ore., who credits his early enthusiasm for transit to \u201cSimCity.\u201d\n\nHe spent many hours trying to build a city with no space for driving at all \u2014 only buses and trains. But like in real life, mass transit is expensive to build and maintain in \u201cSimCity,\u201d and some of the residents still want to drive, no matter how convenient your rail system is. He was never able to make it work. (Today, he\u2019s a self-described \u201crabble rouser\u201d working to halt a proposed freeway expansion.)\n\nThat issue speaks to a larger criticism of \u201cSimCity\u201d: Wright\u2019s vision imposed an old-school approach to city-building, influenced by Robert Moses and the Chicago school. For those early urban planners, and in \u201cSimCity,\u201d there were binary solutions to problems. To lower crime rates, build police stations. If people complain about traffic, build more roads. If you need space to build a freeway or a stadium, raze working-class neighborhoods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA lot of the assumptions baked into that game are the normative assumptions that we need to be questioning,\u201d Brown said.\n\nSome of that includes examining what the game chooses to leave out: The environment wasn\u2019t a consideration beyond air quality. The race of a city\u2019s populace was largely a non-factor.\n\nGreener, more global games\n\nThe next generation of \u201cSimCity\u201d players may have a different perspective.\n\nThe \u201cSimCity: BuildIt\u201d app, developed at EA\u2019s Twentytrack studio in Helsinki, Finland, has 6.1 million players and more than 200 million lifetime downloads, according to EA. Inka Spara, the game manager, said the team has purposefully brought a more European perspective to the game.\n\nMany of them played previous versions of \u201cSimCity\u201d in the early stages of app development. She said they recognized that Wright\u2019s approach stemmed from a very American, very 20th century style of city-building.\n\nIt struck them how the buildings and maps all appeared American. So they added different types of architecture and topography from cities in Asia and Europe. As of the most recent release, players can build on a map with fjords.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually had a lot of fights about parking spaces,\u201d Spara said, specifically, working with the artists to keep visible parking in their residential building models. Like their predecessors, she said, her team\u2019s artists prefer the way the houses look without any parking. But it was important for her to maintain some level of realism.\n\nBike lanes are something they\u2019ve considered adding to the game in the future, she said. \u201cPeople just love biking here.\u201d\n\nFrom the L.A. Times Archives: Only a Game? Will your town thrive or perish? The fate of millions is in your hands. Or so it seems. It\u2019s your turn in SimCity. \u00bb\n\nIn general, Spara said environmentalism and climate change are topics they\u2019ve worked hard to address. You can play a \u201cGreen City\u201d map in which residents have urban gardens and there\u2019s less pollution. Solar power is now an option.\n\n\u201cWe can see that those things resonate really well with folks that play the game,\u201d she said.\n\nJarrett Walker is a consultant in public transit network design and policy who runs the blog Human Transit. Call him \u201cSimCity\u201d-critical: He has written at length about the game over the years, with posts such as \u201cDid SimCity make us stupid?\u201d and \u201cSimCity will continue to mislead on transit.\u201d\n\nFor people who become planners, Walker said, the \u201cSimCity\u201d games are a good introduction to the field. Those people will go on to understand what the game gets right and wrong. But the vast majority of players, whose exposure to city planning begins and ends with the game, might come to think \u201cSimCity\u2019s\u201d approach is the only way to build a city. By masking the real-world effect of car-oriented transit and only allowing single-use zoning, he said, \u201cSimCity\u201d veers from entertainment into ideology.\n\nTop of mind among city planners today is a set of problems not present in the game.\n\nJose Sanchez, an assistant professor in the architecture school at USC, tried to address some of \u201cSimCity\u2019s\u201d oversights in his game, \u201cBlock\u2019hood,\u201d namely ecology and verticality, instead of sprawl.\n\n\u201c\u2018SimCity\u2019 establishes a very fundamental literacy in systems,\u201d Sanchez said. He hopes games like his will extend that literacy to some of the finer points of city-building.\n\nHe\u2019s currently working on a sequel, \u201cCommon\u2019hood,\u201d which takes into account neighborhood-level problems such as homelessness and drug addiction.\n\njessica.roy@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @jessica_roy", "description": "SimCity just turned 30.
