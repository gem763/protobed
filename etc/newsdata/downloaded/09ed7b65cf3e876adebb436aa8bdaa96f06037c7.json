I\u2019ve asked God for forgiveness,\u201d the 31-year-old said, her voice quivering. \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t deserve a chance to be with my family and friends. I wish he was the one with the gun that killed me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d Guyger added. \u201cThis is not about hate. It\u2019s about being scared that night.\u201d\n\nEarlier in her testimony, the ex-cop, who was still in uniform but off-duty when she killed Jean, recalled talking to her police partner, Martin Rivera, with whom she\u2019d been having an affair, as she parked her car on the fourth floor of the apartment complex, instead of the third.\n\n\u201cI was just ready to go home, \u201d she told jurors, describing her mindset as she approached Jean\u2019s door.\n\nGuyger was fired and charged with murder in the wake of the fatal shooting, which she\u2019s claimed was in self defense after she mistook Jean for an intruder in her home. The tragedy prompted a wave of protests across Dallas over racial bias and excessive use of force by police.\n\nProsecutors said during opening arguments in the trial on Monday that Guyger was \u201cdistracted\u201d by her intimate phone call with Rivera, which ended only a few minutes before Jean was shot, and that she \u201cmade a series of unreasonable errors and unreasonable decisions and unreasonable choices.\u201d They claim she missed obvious signs that she\u2019d opened the door into the wrong apartment.\n\nGuyger\u2019s lawyers said she was simply exhausted after work and residents at the apartment complex often confused other apartments for their own, as the layout of each floor is identical.\n\nAt the start of her testimony, Guyger\u2019s lawyer asked about her childhood and career as a police officer.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to help people and that was the one career that I thought I could help people in,\u201d she said.\n\nGuyger faces up to 99 years in prison if convicted.", "description": "The former Dallas cop testified about the night she killed her black neighbor, 26-year-old Botham Jean. \u201cI wish he was the one with the gun that killed me,\u201d she said.", "authors": ["Danika Fears", "Breaking News Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1144,w_2034,x_0,y_172/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569595176/RTX74AGC_ukk2j3", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
