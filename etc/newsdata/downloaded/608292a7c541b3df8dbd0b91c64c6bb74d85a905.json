REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nThe NBA on Thursday published a post on Chinese social networking platform Weibo promoting the match between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets, accompanied by a short clip featuring star players LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. The game is scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. local time (1130 GMT).\n\nNBA events scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday were cancelled and Chinese sponsors and partners suspended or severed ties with the league after Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted last week supporting anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong.\n\nState television CCTV and Tencent will not show Thursday\u2019s game or the rematch scheduled for Saturday in Shenzhen on their platforms, underscoring the severity of the backlash.\n\nThe Hong Kong protests began in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy. China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong, and Chinese state media has characterised Morey\u2019s tweet as the latest example of meddling in China\u2019s own affairs.\n\nLeague commissioner Adam Silver spoke out in support of Morey\u2019s freedom of expression on Tuesday, further angering Beijing. The NBA\u2019s business in China, which took years to cultivate, and estimates is estimated to be worth more than $4 billion, is under immense pressure.\n\nThe NBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Silver would address the media Thursday or whether Saturday\u2019s Lakers-Nets game would take place.\n\nChinese state and party-backed media continued to publish items critical of the NBA. The official English newspaper China Daily published an editorial cartoon on Thursday playing on the NBA\u2019s official logo of an athlete dribbling a basketball. The cartoon instead put a bomb labelled \u201cpolitics\u201d in the athlete\u2019s hand, leaving the basketball fallen by the wayside.\n\nSome Chinese netizens also called on those attending Thursday\u2019s game to carry the Chinese flag into the stadium in a demonstration of patriotic solidarity.\n\n\u201cThose going to watch the game live, remember to bring the national flag,\u201d one user on Weibo wrote. \u201cHope to see a sea of red, five-starred red flag fluttering in the wind.\u201d", "description": "The National Basketball Association (NBA) is pressing ahead with a exhibition game Thursday evening in Shanghai, despite backlash against the league from China after a Houston Rockets executive's tweet supporting Hong Kong protests.", "authors": ["Se Young Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439162325&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990FQ", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
