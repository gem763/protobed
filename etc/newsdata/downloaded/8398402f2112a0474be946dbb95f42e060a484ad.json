But the rapper heralded another season too, one that towers gloriously above the rest, that always ends up at the back of group pictures, and that occasionally struggles to buy jeans that don\u2019t look like flood pants. Yes, friends \u2013 it was a Tall Girl Summer.\n\nThere was Megan, whose moniker comes from the fact that she\u2019s 5\u201910\u201d. There was Lizzo, also 5\u201910\u201d, who made all of us, tall and short and average, feel good as hell. In the spring, Brienne of Tarth, 6\u20193\u201d, was knighted and then became a blogger. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, 5\u201910\u201d, made us all unbearably horny for hot, slightly shorter priests. Nicole Kidman, 5\u201911\u201d, got her first puppy. And of course, there was the tallest girl of all, Peppa Pig, who, some claimed, clocks in at a statuesque 7\u20191\u201d. Even eggs were bigger, and by extension, taller than before.\n\nClearly reading the energy of the season, Netflix last week dropped a trailer for Tall Girl, a rom-com about a 6\u20191\u201d teen, Jordi, who exists in a universe where Tall Girl Summer didn\u2019t happen and is therefore bullied for being the tallest girl in her high school. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, Jordi \u2014 you\u2019re the tall girl,\u201d an average-sized bully sneers at one point in a tone that suggests that\u2019s a real thing people say. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a tall girl, it\u2019s the only thing that people see,\u201d Jordi says sadly.\n\nLike so many rom-com heroines before her, Jordi eventually self-actualizes by taking her ponytail out and wearing her hair loose. But if only she existed on this timeline and could see all the tall girls around her, stretching magnificently up toward the sky like sunflowers. Does Elizabeth Debicki (6\u20193\u201d) exist in Jordi\u2019s timeline? Does Tilda Swinton (5\u201911\u201d)?\n\nAlthough Labor Day marks the unofficial end of the season, Tall Girl Summer isn\u2019t technically over yet. There are still a few weeks to embrace one\u2019s tallness, regardless of your height \u2014 to literally or figuratively look down on those around you, to go to concerts and be like, \u201cAhh, sorry, can you see?,\u201d to wrap your legs into in a blood-constricting bow in airplane seats. Eventually, the weather will cool, the leaves will turn, and the tall girls will cocoon themselves in sweaters and jackets, hunched over against the cold. But for now, enjoy the last tall days of summer. It\u2019s probably preferable to a bowl-cut summer.\n\nStay in touch.
