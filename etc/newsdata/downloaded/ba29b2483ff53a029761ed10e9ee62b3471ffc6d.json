Bird is leaving Citi after 20 years and serving in several key roles, including CEO of the bank's Asia Pacific division.\n\nFraser has been at Citi for 15 years since she joined McKinsey to run client strategy in the corporate and investment bank. She also led the bank's corporate strategy and M&A group during the financial crisis. She later ran the global private bank followed by the U.S. consumer and commercial banking and mortgages.\n\nHer most recent role, however, was serving as the CEO of Latin America. Replacing her in that role will be Ernesto Torres Cantu who is currently CEO of Citibanamex.\n\nThe position of president opened up in April when Jamie Forese retired after more than three decades at the bank. Forese was one of the longest serving executives at Citi. At one point, Forese was seen as a possible successor to CEO Corbat.\n\nShares of Citi were mostly unchanged in after-hours trading on Thursday.", "description": "Citi CEO Michael Corbat said he tapped Fraser for the the role to make sure the bank is well positioned for the next decade and beyond.", "authors": ["Elly Cosgrove"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106202395-1571953506227gettyimages-1140271268.jpeg?v=1571953541", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
