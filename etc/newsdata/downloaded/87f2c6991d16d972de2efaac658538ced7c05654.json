I think my take on it is different to a lot of observers, but hear me out!\n\nRollins slayed Brock Lesnar and survived Braun Strowman, but the fearful Fiend is an entirely different proposition. Wyatt is the overwhelming bookmakers\u2019 favourite heading into tonight\u2019s event and a lot of fans would say rightfully so, as there is a firm opinion among many observers that Wyatt losing yet another key match would risk derailing this thrilling new character.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely true that he has suffered down the years from a poor win-loss record. But this new gimmick is still in its infancy, the Fiend has only actually had one match, and it\u2019s too soon for him to be winning this title. It also makes little sense to dethrone Seth Rollins, having spent months building him as WWE\u2019s top face, with two wins over the usually unassailable Brock Lesnar, and then a massive win against Braun Strowman.\n\nRollins is an ever-present ring general and true \u2018workhorse\u2019 champion. In contrast, Wyatt has struggled to deliver top tier performances in singles competition, and is best deployed in short bursts, which is part of The Fiend\u2019s success. It\u2019s exciting not knowing when he will turn up and what he will do. He doesn\u2019t need the belt for that to be the case.\n\nAlso, when Kane came to Rollins\u2019 aid on an episode of Raw last month, he was savaged by The Fiend, sowing the seeds for a possible battle against Kane\u2019s brother, The Undertaker. That followed 11:19 appearing on the clock in the Firefly Fun House - the date (in American styling) that Taker made his WWE debut in 1990. A showdown with the Deadman seems like a logical destination for The Fiend, so there remains a suspicion that outside interference from Kane or Taker could cost Wyatt title gold this evening.\n\nWhether or not that comes to fruition, I sense WWE will find a way to keep the title on Seth for now with some kind of controversial finish, even if it risks infuriating many viewers.\n\nWait for The Fiend to win in under a minute now and trash my argument!\n\n", "description": "Seth Rollins will be locked inside Hell in a Cell with 'The Fiend' Bray Wyatt - follow all the action here", "authors": ["Neil Docking"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20464495.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Seth-Rollins-The-Fiend-Hell-in-a-Cell-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
