Photo: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images\n\nAs soon as Matthew Macfadyen hops on the phone to discuss the Succession finale, he admits he hasn\u2019t had the chance to watch it yet. He\u2019s calling from London, where it\u2019s currently bleak and rainy, and he promises he\u2019s going to watch \u201conce the children are back in school and safely ensconced their bedrooms or whatever.\u201d Still, he\u2019s delighted to share his memories of filming the twisty, sun-drenched finale on a giant yacht off the coast of Croatia, where he got to wear nice linens, slide off a waterslide, and film extended scenes with a cast of actors he admires.\n\nMacfayden\u2019s experience on the yacht, it must be said, was a lot better than his character\u2019s: Tom Wambsgans spends most of the finale fearing for his job after a disastrous congressional hearing, or getting increasingly fed up with his wife, Shiv (Sarah Snook), who insists on extending their open marriage into having a threesome. Finally, Tom snaps, tells Shiv he thinks he\u2019d be happier without her, and starts stealing chicken off Logan\u2019s plate. In advance of his own viewing of the finale, Macfadyen broke it all down for us.\n\nTom goes through a lot in the finale, but I want to start by asking about the moment where he takes a piece of chicken from Logan and says, \u201cThank you for the chicken.\u201d What do you remember about that scene?\n\nThe first time I did it, I grabbed a really big bit of breast of the chicken off Brian\u2019s plate and I almost choked. We managed for about two and a half seconds and then we just cracked up. He rarely giggles, so if he goes, that\u2019s it. Game\u2019s over. I had to really concentrate, and I took a smaller bite of the leg. I ended up with a drumstick, but I had quite a lot of chicken. It\u2019s so batty and odd and so Succession, that moment. Tom\u2019s really at a low ebb. He thinks, Fuck it, you know?\n\nTom reaches a point where he can\u2019t take it anymore, with Shiv and with the whole family. Did you talk much beforehand about what would finally push him over the edge?\n\nThe less talking about those things the better, unless there\u2019s confusion or if there\u2019s anything that\u2019s really opaque. Most of the time, Sarah and I can\u2019t wait to shoot the scene. Then, in the shooting of it with Mark Mylod, the director, things occur to you in the moment.\n\nIt must be fun to shoot a breakup scene on a lovely beach in the Mediterranean. Were there any moments with Sarah in the shooting of that scene that changed your performance?\n\nI just love acting with her. She\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s such a treat that we have these great big family scenes, and often they\u2019re very long scenes. The big one on the yacht was almost ten minutes \u2014 it was a whole magazine of film that we used. It\u2019s really exciting working with such brilliant actors, \u2019cause you\u2019re forced to pay attention. We have maybe three or four cameras, and they\u2019re so skillful at picking up bits and pieces and moving around. You never really know how much you\u2019re featuring in that take of that scene. It makes you concentrate.\n\nWhen I watched the episode, I initially thought, Good for Tom, finally standing up for himself! But then I got worried. Would Shiv and Tom really get divorced? What might happen to him if he\u2019s on the Roys\u2019 bad side? Have you thought about where things might go next season?\n\nNo, I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019m pretty passive about it. They must be tucked into the writers\u2019 room now, but I don\u2019t mind where they decide to go.\n\nYou don\u2019t worry about what might happen?\n\nBecause there\u2019s nothing I can do. He\u2019s not my baby. It\u2019s not my character. It\u2019s Jesse Armstrong\u2019s and the writers\u2019. When the script\u2019s coming home, then my job starts. Till then, it\u2019s out of my hands.\n\nThere was a lot of speculation about who the \u201cblood sacrifice\u201d would be in the finale. Were you and the cast invested in that?\n\n[Laughs.] Yeah, there was muffled chat about it throughout the preceding episodes. Someone would say, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s this person.\u201d Someone else would say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s definitely not going to be them, it may be you.\u201d We didn\u2019t really know until the read-through.\n\nWhat was your reaction to the twist ending, when you learned that Kendall would sell out Logan?\n\nI thought it was really clever. You go, \u201cKendall\u2019s gonna take the hit,\u201d and then that wonderful final twist. It\u2019s a very satisfying conclusion.\n\nIt makes the company much more unstable, which must hard for a company man like Tom.\n\nHe just wishes he was in a nice, stable, multibillion-pound-a-year company. Not one that\u2019s so on the waves. It\u2019s an interesting dynamic because it looks like Greg has perhaps gone onto Team Kendall now. My only selfish worry would be not seeing more of my friend Greg. [Laughs.] My special friend Gregory.\n\nI was jealous that you all got to spend time on this big yacht and wear linen clothing and everything. Did you actually stay onboard?\n\nWe asked, obviously. It was brilliant because we\u2019d jump on a speedboat and have a 20-minute ride to the set \u2014 which was the yacht, every day. It was a joke. The next time I\u2019m filming in the rain, or in a city environment, or in the filthy gray back countryside, I\u2019ll remember that. I\u2019d almost say it was no imagination required because you\u2019re aboard this enormous floating palace. It\u2019s very easy to think, Oh, this is where I vacation. It has ruined any kind of yacht experience for anybody who was there for the rest of their lives.\n\nAll other yachts will be smaller and disappointing.\n\nThey\u2019ll look a bit mean in comparison.\n\nYou also had to go off the inflatable slide down the side of the yacht, which is a pretty funny acting challenge. How do you look sad while going off the side of a yacht in the Mediterranean?\n\nI did a couple of takes! [Laughs.] Such fun, just a silly, silly day of work.\n\nIn the congressional hearings, we learn that Tom has routinely harassed Greg by sending him emails that say, \u201cYou can\u2019t make a Tomelette without breaking some Greggs.\u201d I was wondering if you knew how Tom spelled \u201comelette\u201d; was it British or American spelling?\n\nI think it was a European spelling, like with the E-double-T. I think properly it was a nod to the British contingent in the writing room.\n\nBefore Tom snaps, he\u2019s dopily trying to go along with everything the Roys suggest on the yacht. What was it like playing that?\n\nHe really tries to please. He tries to be a good guy and wants to be popular and wants to be useful. He likes the trappings of wealth and status and all the rest of it, but it\u2019s a scary environment.\n\nThere are these moments earlier in the season, like when they\u2019re in their room at the Pierce estate, where you can see a bit of tenderness between Shiv and Tom. But when they\u2019re actively playing the game, she switches that tenderness off.\n\nIt\u2019s a gift for an actor, those wonderful big swerves of tone. Slightly unhinged, but it\u2019s wonderful.\n\nSpeaking of those swerves, there\u2019s a debate in our office about whether Succession is a drama or a comedy. What side do you fall on?\n\nWell, the actor\u2019s job is to play everything dead straight. Truthfully. The situation is funny, but life is funny. Life is ridiculous. Life is a farce. Look at the clown in the White House. You couldn\u2019t make it up. So I would always err on the side of saying it\u2019s a drama with jokes. Life is inherently preposterous and scary.\n\nWhen I talked to your wife, Keeley Hawes, last year, she said she might be the only person rooting for Tom. Is that still the case?\n\nShe\u2019s a good wife, very loyal! She has been working her socks off, so she hasn\u2019t been watching. I think she\u2019s seen the first episode, so she\u2019s a little behind, so hopefully she\u2019ll be rooting for me this season.", "description": "Matthew Macfadyen discusses what it was like filming Succession\u2019s season two finale in Croatia, stealing chicken off of Brian Cox\u2019s plate, and what might be next for Tom Wambsgans and Shiv Rov.", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/11/11-matthew-macfadyen-chatroom.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
