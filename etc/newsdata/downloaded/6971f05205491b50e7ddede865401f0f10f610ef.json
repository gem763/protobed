Google Assistant\u2019s AI smarts will then recognize the difference between a human voice and the ear-piercing low-quality music businesses often use to keep you \u201centertained\u201d when they place you on hold.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear how the feature will work \u2013 whether you\u2019ll be able to put the Pixel 4 down while you\u2019re on hold or whether you still need to be attentive and wait for the business representative to get on the phone. It\u2019s also uncertain how the Pixel 4 would let you know when a real live customer service representative gets on the phone after putting you on hold.\n\nRead more: Google\u2019s Pixel 4 is expected to be a major change from past Pixel phones. Here are the most credible rumors we\u2019ve heard about it so far.\n\nSome call-hold recordings have human voice messages, which often hint how the thing you\u2019re calling about can be done online. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if Google\u2019s AI can recognize the difference between a voice recording and a live human person.\n\nAnd while some businesses have adopted the call-back system \u2013 which lets you hang up the phone and keeps your place in line to speak with a representative, then get a call back when your turn is up \u2013 it\u2019s still relatively new, and not all businesses have adopted the system. The Pixel 4\u2019s call-hold feature may help in the meantime.\n\nThe feature is still in early development and is unlikely to launch at the same time as the Pixel 4\u2019s launch, 9to5Google reports. Google is expected to announce the Pixel 4 in October, when the company usually announces its Pixel smartphones.", "description": "Business Insider - Google Assistant on the Pixel 4 will take over when you're on hold to speak with a business representative, effectively waiting in line for you..
