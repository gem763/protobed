David Tomas was asked by Sedgwick whether he agreed that access to capital wasn't a barrier. \"I totally agree,\" he said. \"I agree with the idea that technology is not as expensive as it used to be.\"\n\n\n\n\"For an SME it was impossible 20 years ago to think of developing any kind of technology but nowadays you can compete, almost, with big corporations in terms of technology,\" Tomas went on to state, explaining that it was more about applying certain knowledge than the technology in itself.\n\nIt is the case that today's SMEs \u2013 small and medium enterprises \u2013 are creating websites, using social media and utilizing technologies such as contactless payments to publicize their offerings and streamline operations.\n\n\n\nThere are challenges, however. According to CitySprint's Collaborate U.K. 2018 report, while 79% of SMEs think that investing in technological innovation is important, 25% have spent less than 10% of their budgets on new technology.\n\n\n\n\"Technology now, it's not a matter of expensive or not expensive, but it's a matter of access to the technology,\" Beatriz Remon, chief digital officer for IBM Spain, Greece, Portugal and Israel, said.", "description": "The discussion took place at at Innovation Summit Barcelona and was chaired by CNBC's Steve Sedgwick.", "authors": ["Anmar Frangoul"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106164299-1570177076811gettyimages-671372147.jpeg?v=1570177112", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
