Plume is re-issuing it this April in a handsome paperback edition, and it\u2019s worth revisiting\u2014or reading for the first time if you\u2019re new to it. Mystery Train isn\u2019t just a seminal book of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll criticism; it\u2019s a one of the great books of American pop culture.\n\nIn the prologue, Marcus writes, \u201cThis is a book about rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u2014some of it\u2014and America. It is not a history, or a purely musical analysis, or a set of personality profiles. It is an attempt to broaden the context in which the music is heard; to deal with rock \u2018n\u2019 roll not as youth culture, or counterculture, simply as American culture.\u201d\n\nMarcus writes beautifully about Harmonica Frank, Robert Johnson, the Band, Sly Stone, Randy Newman, and Elvis. This may seem like a curious mix of artists, but according to Marcus, they \u201cshare unique musical and public personalities, enough ambition to make even their failures interesting, and a lack of critical commentary extensive or committed enough to do their work justice. In their music and in their careers, they share a range and a depth that seem to crystalize naturally in visions and versions of America: its possibilities, limits, openings, traps. Their stories are hardly the whole story, but they can tell us how much the story matters.\u201d", "description": "For the great rock critic Greil Marcus, Elvis Presley embodied the promise of the Declaration of Independence: better than nobody, nobody better.", "authors": ["Greil Marcus"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492185162/articles/2015/03/28/the-stacks-how-elvis-drove-america-s-mystery-train/150327-stacks-elvis-tease_hjtqlh", "published_at": "2015-03-28"}
