I feel good. The sun will shine tomorrow. I\u2019ll wake up, work out, move forward.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmitting that he would\u2019ve liked to have continued, he added that he thought his 2015 accidental overdose \u2013 where he ended up in a coma \u2013 left memory damage that effected his ability to learn the moves.\n\nMore: Lamar Odom Khloe Kardashian parties at same nightclub as ex-husband Lamar Odom Lamar Odom sucks his girlfriend's toes in a car - and it's all shared on Instagram Lamar Odom and Sean Spicer lead the wild Dancing with the Stars 2019 line up\n\n\u2018My cognitive memory \u2026 just memorizing the dance routine was difficult at times, but I felt like I got better every week,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s so crazy because I felt like this was my best dance tonight.\u2019\n\nLauren Alaina, Sailor Brinkley-Cook, Hannah Brown, James Van Der Beek, Kate Flannery, Kel Mitchell, Ally Brooke and Sean Spicer join Karamo in holding their place in the competition.\n\nDancing With The Stars airs Monday on ABC in the US, with dances available on YouTube internationally shortly after.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
