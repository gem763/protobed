They don't need me to tell them when they haven't played at the level they can.\n\n'The key is always to recover from the result. We have to move forward and focus on tomorrow.\n\n'I don't think defeats harm teams if the reaction is good. Then what you learn from defeats and the resilience from defeats are important parts of a player's career.\n\n'I have always maintained that we have to qualify, and we haven't secured that qualification yet and our focus tomorrow is to get the performance and result.'\n\nThere has been suggestion that Southgate may revert to a three-man defence which was used to great effect during last year's run to the World Cup semi-final, but the England boss remained coy on the idea.\n\nThe Three Lions will be desperate to bounce back against Bulgaria in Sofia on Monday night\n\n'We are always looking at every aspect,' he added. 'We train and have meetings specifically on every area of the performance. There is always particular focus when an area is not going too well.\n\n'In terms of tactical adjustments, we are always thinking about the best way to get the best players on the field, be the most dangerous, to get the best of our strengths but hide our weaknesses.\n\n'We have done that over three years. We have tried different formations, we tried something first half the other night. In hindsight - because of the result - it didn't work but it doesn't mean it was wrong to have a go at it.\n\n'If we don't ever think about evolving and trying those things then we will never progress as a team. We will always continue to make those assessments and the priority is to put in a good performance.'", "description": "Gareth Southgate has fired a warning to James Maddison after he was spotted in a casino after withdrawing from the England squad due to illness.", "authors": ["Jonathan Spencer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/18/19661530-0-image-a-57_1570987860314.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
