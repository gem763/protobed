After Patron Sanchez killed one of his enemies in 2015, Veytia even assisted in covering up the slaying, the papers said.\n\nOther times, Veytia used wiretaps and conducted raids targeting rival drug gangs, the papers said. He also arranged for the members and associates of the cartel to be sprung from prison, they add.\n\nAccording to press reports, Veytia survived a 2011 assassination attempt and promoted himself as a law-and-order candidate when he ran for attorney general.\n\n\"Nayarit is not fertile ground for lawbreaking,\" he once said. \"Here, there is no room for organized crime.\"", "description": "A former state attorney general from Mexico was sentenced Thursday to 20 years in prison in a U.S. drug-trafficking case accusing him of using wiretaps and other law enforcement tools to protect the turf of a violent drug cartel.
