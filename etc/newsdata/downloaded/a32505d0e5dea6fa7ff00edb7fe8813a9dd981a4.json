These new middle-market investments included three European investments, providing additional diversity with the goal of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns. In today's competitive environment, Barings' wide investment frame of reference across global markets and multiple asset classes, further enabled by our joint venture with the South Carolina Retirement System, allows us to find attractive investment opportunities while maintaining an appropriate balance between risk and current income.\"\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2019, the Company reported total investment income of $19.3 million, net investment income of $8.0 million, or $0.16 per share, and a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $5.2 million, or $0.10 per share.\n\nNet asset value (\"NAV\") per share as of September 30, 2019 was $11.58, as compared to $11.59 as of June 30, 2019. The change in NAV per share from June 30, 2019 to September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to net unrealized depreciation on the Company's investment portfolio and foreign currency transactions of approximately $0.04 per share and a net realized loss of $0.02 per share, partially offset by net investment income exceeding the second quarter dividend by $0.02 per share and the impact of accretive share repurchases of $0.03 per share.\n\nShare Repurchase Plan\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Company adopted a share repurchase plan, pursuant to Board approval, for the purpose of repurchasing shares of the Company's common stock in the open market (the \"Share Repurchase Plan\"). The Board authorized the Company to repurchase in 2019 up to a maximum of 5.0% of the amount of shares outstanding under the following targets:\n\na maximum of 2.5% of the amount of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding if shares trade below NAV per share but in excess of 90% of NAV per share; and\n\na maximum of 5.0% of the amount of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding if shares trade below 90% of NAV per share.\n\nAs of October 29, 2019, the Company had repurchased a total 1,998,835 shares of its common stock in the open market under the Share Repurchase Plan at an average price of $9.95 per share, including broker commissions. The shares of common stock purchased under the Share Repurchase Plan represent approximately 3.9% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares as of February 25, 2019.\n\nLiquidity and Capitalization\n\nAs of September 30, 2019, the Company had cash of $12.8 million, short-term money market fund investments of $51.6 million, $169.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Barings BDC Senior Funding I, LLC credit agreement (\"BSF Credit Agreement\"), $122.8 million of borrowings outstanding under its $800.0 million senior secured revolving credit agreement and $340.8 million outstanding under its term debt securitization.
