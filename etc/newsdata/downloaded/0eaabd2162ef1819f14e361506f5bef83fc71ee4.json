By doing so, the market looks ready to go higher, to reach towards the $18 level. It\u2019s only a matter time before the market breaks out to the upside though, because quite frankly the geopolitical situation continues to cause major issues. At this juncture, there are plenty of geopolitical situations that demand safety, just as there are economic conditions failing. Beyond all of that, we also have central banks around the world cutting interest rates and doing more quantitative easing. If that\u2019s going to be the case, the precious metals should be a beneficiary.\n\nSILVER Video 07.10.19\n\nUnderneath, we have the 200 day EMA sitting at the $16.19 level, and that of course will define the overall trend. It\u2019s very unlikely that we reach to that area unless of course we get some extraordinarily good news coming from the economic front. The other possibility would be some type of hawkish stance by the Federal Reserve, but right now that doesn\u2019t look to be very likely. Ultimately, this is a market that seems to go higher over the longer-term, and you can even make an argument for a bullish pennant on the weekly chart that suggests we could go as high as $25, but obviously that would be months down the road. All things being equal, buying dips should continue to be the way forward.\n\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Silver markets have pulled back a bit during the trading session on Friday but have found support to form a hammer shaped candle stick.
