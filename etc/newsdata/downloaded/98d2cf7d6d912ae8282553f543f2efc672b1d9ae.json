Prices were already higher after U.S. President Donald Trump said talks with Chinese counterparts are going \u201creally well\u201d and that they will continue on Friday, offering a glimmer of hope for global demand.\n\nThe tanker explosion will spur fresh concern about potential conflict in the world\u2019s most important crude-producing region after attacks on ships and drones earlier this year, and most recently a strike on Saudi Arabian energy infrastructure. Oil is still down about 19% from its peak in April as the prolonged U.S.-China dispute adds to a bleak economic outlook.\n\n\u201cThe explosion points to potential geopolitical risks and that has once again surprised the market to the upside,\u201d said Will Sungchil Yun, a commodities analyst at HI Investment & Futures Corp. in Seoul. \u201cIt still remains to be seen whether prices will keep rising as investors are putting their focus on the trade talks and the gains won\u2019t last long if the negotiations result in a no-deal.\u201d\n\ncrude for December settlement rose as much as $1.36, or 2.3%, to $60.46 a barrel on the London-based ICE (NYSE: ) Futures Europe Exchange. The contract is up 3.5% this week and traded at $60.44 a barrel at 7:37 a.m. in London.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate for November jumped as much as $1.14, or 2.1%, to $54.69 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract climbed 96 cents to $53.55 on Thursday, the highest level in more than a week. Prices are up 3.5% this week.\n\nSee also: Oil Market Next Year \u2018a Mess\u2019 for Shale Drillers, Seaport Says\n\nKey Saudi Arabian oil-processing facilities were attacked on Sept. 14, a strike that curbed about 5% of global output and was blamed on Iran.
