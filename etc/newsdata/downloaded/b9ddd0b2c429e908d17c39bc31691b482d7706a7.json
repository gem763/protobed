From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nA company called Flylolo, based in West Sussex, has been selling half-term holiday flights from Gatwick, Glasgow and Manchester to the Canary Islands.\n\nBut the 3,000 passengers booked to fly to and from Fuerteventura, Lanzarote and Tenerife were informed just days \u2013 and in some cases hours \u2013 ahead that their flights were grounded.\n\nFlylolo has no planes. The idea was to charter other airlines to do the actual flying. Flylolo would hire them only for dates of high demand, and not have any obligation for off-peak times.\n\nIn its terms and conditions, Flylolo says: \u201cThe flights referred to in our program are planned and operated by the designated airline on specific aircraft many months in advance.\n\n\u201cWe reserve the right to change airlines or aircraft types at any time.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The company has limited funds, he says, as its capital base \u201chas been eroded by the economic malaise caused by Brexit\u201d.\n\nMr Dendle says: \u201cIn desperation we had been in discussions all last week to secure a deal with a couple of airlines. We offered them equity in the company or additional profit share if they would supply the aircraft.\u201d\n\nWhat happens now to the passengers?\n\nFlylolo says they will all get their money back within two weeks. However, that is of little comfort to families who have spent thousands of pounds on flights, with accommodation booked and paid for separately. They have little chance of recouping these \u201cconsequential losses\u201d. Few alternative flights have space, and seats that are available are very expensive.\n\nAren\u2019t passengers whose trips are cancelled entitled to replacement flights?\n\nYes. Under European air passengers\u2019 rights rules known as 261/2004, an airline that cancels a flight would have to pay each traveller \u20ac400 and find (and pay for) the best available alternative flights.\n\nBut Flylolo says: \u201cAny claims should be directed to the airline, we cannot accept any claims under regulation 261/2004.\u201d\n\nAs no airline was confirmed, there is no one from whom to claim.\n\nHow does Flylolo sell its tickets?\n\nOnline. Earlier this year it did a fair amount of promotion, with advertisements promising \u201cless stress more enjoyment\u201d.\n\nDuring a round of promotional interviews earlier this year, the founder, Paul Dendle, said: \u201cThe budget airlines drive prices up for the school holidays.\n\n\u201cThey lose money in May-June, they lose money in October, and they recover the moneys they\u2019ve lost in those three months by charging higher prices for the July, August, September dates.\n\n\u201cWe look to just put aircraft on for the peak season, from July to September, and we can actually undercut the low-cost carriers but we can also include lots of things within our prices that are extras with others.\u201d\n\nAccording to passengers who have contacted The Independent, a significant number of bookings were made by clicking through on the fare-comparison website, Skyscanner.\n\nA spokesperson for Skyscanner said: \"We truly sympathise with those travellers whose flights with Flylolo have been cancelled and we are doing our best to find out more information from Flylolo.\n\n\"As a business we pride ourselves on putting the traveller first and always seek to assist travellers where we can to help them understand what action they can take.\n\n\"Travellers can be reassured that Flylolo is Atol protected, meaning anyone impacted by this will receive a full refund \u2013 and we have been advised by Flylolo that this will be within 10 working days.\n\n\"We are continuing to try and follow up with Flylolo to get further additional information for those travellers affected.\"\n\nWhat does the Civil Aviation Authority say?\n\n\u201cWe are aware that flights planned by tour operator FlyLolo from Glasgow to Tenerife South and Arrecife in Lanzarote this weekend will not go ahead.\n\n\u201cWhere an ATOL licenced tour operator is unable to deliver the services it has sold to its customers, we would expect them to refund passengers in full.\n\n\u201cWe therefore advise Flylolo customers to contact the operator directly for further information.\u201d\n\nThe airline\u2019s telephone number is 08444 720737, and its email is team@loloflights.com.\n\nTravellers currently abroad might expect to be protected by the Atol scheme, but as Flylolo is still a going concern \u2013 currently selling flights for the Christmas season \u2013 the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) will not step in.\n\nWhat do we know about Flylolo\u2019s founder?\n\nIn 1984, Paul Dendle founded the seat-only provider, Avro, and sold it 11 years later to the owners of Monarch Airlines. On his blog, he writes: \u201c30 years ago I started Avro Plc which was fore runner to the no frills carriers, we sold cheap seats to the masses sending people abroad on cheap flight only deals, one of our biggest sellers was Alicante and we had 20 aircraft at Alicante airport on some nights.\u201d\n\nHe was re-elected in May 2019 as a Conservative councillor on Arun District Council in West Sussex.", "description": "A start-up carrier called Flylolo has just told 3,000 people who had bought half-term holiday flights between Britain and the Canaries that their flights are cancelled.
