We have to be on the money straight from the off, concentration from minute one and expect the unexpected.\n\n\u201cThey have so many good players and trick plays, and we have to be on our mettle.\n\n\u201cThe form Australia are carrying into this, they have grown as a team again and are playing some unbelievable rugby.\n\n\u201cThey have got threats of physicality, speed, aerial threats as well. The form they are bringing in is impressive. We have to go up a gear.\n\n\u201cWe know we have to be at our best. The second half (against Georgia on Monday) we were nowhere near where we need to be to beat Australia.\u201d\n\nWales opened their World Cup campaign with a 43-14 victory over Georgia, when they secured a try-scoring bonus point during a dominant display in the first 40 minutes.\n\nThey went off the boil after that, but still showed enough to suggest it could be a tournament when Wales feature as major contenders.\n\nNorth added: \u201cWe expected physicality (against Georgia) and started strongly, but we should have turned up the pace a little more in the first half.\n\n\u201cYou always need one bang-out to get your lungs working at this humidity and temperature, and understanding how the ball handles in this temperature, too. It\u2019s quite interesting.\n\n\u201cThat first half showed the intensity we wanted to go with. The second half we lost our way a bit and maybe came off the gas a bit. Maybe we should have turned it up a bit more.\u201d\n\nWales head coach Warren Gatland is due to name his team for the Australia game on Friday.\n\nChanges are likely to be at a minimum \u2013 if any \u2013 following the Georgia encounter, although prop Nicky Smith and back-row forward Ross Moriarty could come into Gatland\u2019s selection equation.\n\nBoth players were on the bench against Georgia in Toyota City.\n\nPA", "description": "George North accepts that Australia are \u201ca tough beast to beat\u201d as Wales\u00a0prepare for a Rugby World Cup showdown against the Wallabies.
