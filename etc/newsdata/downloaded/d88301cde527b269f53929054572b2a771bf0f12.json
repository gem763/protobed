Almost 25 years after the Ipswich Town goalkeeper had his tracksuit bottoms pulled down by Manchester United, the Premier League's 9-0 club has a new member.\n\nAngus Gunn now shares the record with Forrest, the Canadian who knows how the young Englishman will be feeling after Southampton's horror show at a rainswept St Mary's Stadium.\n\nCraig Forrest was between the sticks as Manchester United ran riot against Ipswich in 1995\n\nIt was in March 1995 when Forrest lost 9-0 with Ipswich at Old Trafford. As a friend of Gunn's father, Bryan, he is prepared to speak with the 23-year-old personally.\n\nSo what will his advice be, from one goalkeeper who conceded nine to another? 'Own it,' Forrest says, speaking to Sportsmail from Toronto. 'I didn't hide, and that's the best way to be about it.\n\n'It's a humbling position. It's going to be crushing for the lad. I went straight to the media room afterwards. They probably didn't expect me to show up. I could have crawled under a rock but I thought, 'You know what? I might as well face it, head on'.\n\n'I'm happy Angus didn't concede a 10th. I've got someone keeping me company. His dad (the former Norwich City goalkeeper) had a situation in a derby against Ipswich, on a back pass.\n\nAngus Gunn now shares the record after shipping nine goals to Leicester at St Mary's\n\n'The ball was centre of goal. It hit a freaking bobble and rolled into the net. Ipswich fans gave it to him forever and ever about that. He knows all about overcoming moments of adversity.\n\n'I must say, after this amount of time, I can smile about it. Sometimes the result defines a goalkeeper. It's not a good record, but at least people remember me for something.'\n\nThat is one way to look at going down in history for the wrong reasons, like how Henry VIII is best remembered for his wives (though at least he stopped at six).\n\nForrest knows what is in store for Gunn. From now on, he will receive messages from friends and family members whenever a scoreline comes close to beating it. Phone calls from journalists wanting juicy quotes.\n\nSocial media explosions every time an anniversary nears. Potentially awkward encounters with those who scored against him that day \u2013 such as Andy Cole, who got five of United's nine goals and bumped into Forrest while holidaying in Barbados recently.\n\nForrest actually thought his record was going in September, when Manchester City took a 5-0 lead against Watford inside 18 minutes at the Etihad Stadium. Yet they got to eight, then stopped.\n\nHe did not even know there was a Premier League game being played on Friday until he received a text that read: 'There's an 8-0 going on\u2026' Then just as he tuned in, Jamie Vardy made it nine.\n\nForrest, whose great grandfather was born and lived in Leicester before moving to Canada, still has an issue with his 9-0, however. 'Mine should have been eight!'\n\nThe reason is Forrest was in the middle of being booked and running back to his goal when United took a quick free-kick and Paul Ince scored into an empty net.\n\nGunn was consoled by opponents after having one of the most torrid evenings of his career\n\n'Graham Poll shouldn't have allowed it,' he explains, laughing. 'Honestly, I think he was loving it. I think he thought he was the 12th player for United!'\n\nForrest can still recall George Burley's pre-match message being 'they won't expect us to attack' and, well, it is safe to say the element of surprise did not pay off.\n\nDespite that defeat, the Canadian went on to be named Ipswich's Player of the Year that season. 'We were a beaten group,' he admits. 'We were going to get relegated. We were lambs to the slaughter.\n\n'The next game after United, against Tottenham and Jurgen Klinsmann, we lost 3-0. I was delighted with that result. I mean, Jesus, it was 2-0 after 15 minutes. I thought, 'Are you kidding me?'\n\nGunn may face further anguish, too, given Southampton now face Manchester City twice in the space of a week \u2013 first in the Carabao Cup, then in the Premier League, both away.\n\nForrest believes double figures will be hit someday, and Pep Guardiola's side are the ones to watch. 'City have the ability,' he says. 'If it was important for them to win 12-0, they could do it.\n\n'We've seen some great teams and when you're here in the moment, maybe you forget about the teams of the past \u2013 your Barcelonas, your Real Madrids, your Manchester Uniteds.\n\n'But it's a different game we're seeing now. If anybody is going to do it, it would be Manchester City.'\n\nGunn can only hope they decide against rubbing salt in his wounds this week.", "description": "Craig Forrest was in goal for Ipswich Town when they lost 9-0 to Man United in 1995.
