It nevertheless backed its outlook for revenue and return on profit.\n\nWrite to Max Bernhard at max.bernhard@dowjones.com; @mxbernhard\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 02:50 ET (06:50 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
