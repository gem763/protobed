The app tracks students inside of the stadium and awards them 100 points for attending a home game and an additional 250 for staying until the fourth quarter.\n\nAccording to the school, the app only tracks students once they are at the stadium and they can close the app or delete it when they leave.\n\nNevertheless, privacy watchdog groups find it alarming that a public university, which is theoretically an extension of the state government, would be using tracking software on students.\n\n\u201cWhy should packing the stadium in the fourth quarter be the last time the government wants to know where students are?\u201d asked Adam Schwartz, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cA public university is a teacher, telling students what is proper in a democratic society.\u201d\n\nAn empty student section at the end of non-conference blowout wins against unranked teams has long been a pet peeve of Nick Saban so it certainly seems possible this program is related to that pain point for the longtime coach.\n\nLast year, Saban said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the lack of cheering from the school\u2019s student section.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: RealClearLife, a news and lifestyle publisher, is now a part of InsideHook.
