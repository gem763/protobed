It's about rugby education, some natural talent through our bloodlines.\"\n\nBy the numbers, 27 of the 31 All Blacks are New Zealand-born as are 50 players scattered across 11 other teams.\n\nExcluding New Zealand, eight of the top 10 ranked countries have New Zealand-origin players including Japan (five), Australia and Scotland (three), England and Ireland (two), and Wales and France (one).", "description": "Michael Leitch is Japan's poster boy, but like many other players at the Rugby World Cup he's not representing his country of birth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5993/7f16d83c310547b0a70c3b2cf9ecf62a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
