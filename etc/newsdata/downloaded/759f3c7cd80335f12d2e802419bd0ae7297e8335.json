The page wrote online.\n\nBath bombs have grown more and more in popularity in recent years, with companies launching obscure designs and colors to attract customers to purchasing the products.\n\nICEE joining in on the trend shows how the company is attempting to branch out from its standard product and attract customers in other ways.\n\nCommenters online actually offered praise for the product, saying they have already tried the bath bombs and enjoyed the scent.\n\n'They actually really rock! I got these a while back for my kids. They had airhead too. Got one of those...they smelled great, colored the water and felt nice! Waaay better for the money than some i got at walmart for almost $4 for 3,' one consumer wrote.\n\n'I would just wanna drink my bath water,' another person wrote.\n\nOn the packaging, ICEE boasts the bath bombs are the 'coldest drink in town', which some consumers pointed out is false advertising given the product should not be ingested by anyone.\n\nDrink it up: The company describes the product as the 'coldest drink in town' but it is actually not edible and should not be consumed by users\n\nRevealed: People were made aware of the bath bombs by Instagram page Dad Bod Snacks\n\n'So are you supposed to drink it? Or bathe in it,' a commenter questioned.\n\n'Uh. It\u2019s especially weird to use the tagline \u201ccoldest drink in town\u201d on a product that is not intended to be ingested and is presumably aimed at kids,' someone else noted, before warning that the company could end up facing a 'lawsuit' for its marketing of the bath bombs.\n\n'Forbidden snow balls,' another described them as, before adding: 'Seriously, I'm gonna end up taking a bite of these and washing it down with some sanitizer.'\n\nOther people said the bath bombs could be concerning for the body depending on the ingredients included in the product to give it the sugary smell.\n\nOne person wrote: 'I am always afraid to use those kind of products in the tub\u2014 I\u2019ll use bath bombs (love them!) but I\u2019m really careful about what\u2019s in them because utis and yeast infections are awful.'\n\nBesides the scents coming in bath bombs, consumers can also purchase their favorites in the form of hand sanitizer.\n\nAirheads also released its own line of bath products scented similar to how the candy product is flavored, further proving companies are working to expand their market of products to attract more customers.", "description": "ICEE created bath bombs in flavors inspired by the sugary drink.
