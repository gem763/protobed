Someone on that kind of salary would have no chance of affording a house at Vaucluse (pictured), where median prices are a mere $4.66 million, unless they won the lottery or were left with a very generous inheritance\n\nHumpty Doo, where there are mango farms and larger blocks, has a median salary of $62,173, ranking ahead of the Willoughby council area taking in Chatswood ($60,273) and the Ku-ring-gai suburbs, including Killara and Turramurra ($60,024).\n\nAreas west of Perth's city centre also made the top 20 including Cambridge council ($62,589), Subiaco ($60,318), Cottesloe ($59,180) and Nedlands ($57,790), with East Fremantle ($59,823) on the other side of the Swan River beating Darwin's city and suburbs ($58,585).\n\nMelbourne doesn't enter the list until No. 19, with the city's Port Phillip council area taking in St Kilda, having a median salary of $57,800.\n\nBrisbane and Adelaide had no local government areas with median salaries above the national median of $55,432.", "description": "More than half the workers in one very cashed-up part of Australia are earning more than $102,306 a year.
