Photo: Netflix\n\nThere\u2019s a short montage in the trailer for Bill Burr\u2019s new Netflix special Paper Tiger that cuts various moments in the special into one brief run of Burr yelling hot-button phrases in mocking tones. \u201cThe #MeToo movement!\u201d he yells. \u201cWhite male privilege! Hipsters! \u2018I\u2019m a male feminist!\u2019\u201d \u201cBy the way, this is gonna be my last show ever,\u201d the trailer cuts to Burr saying next. The implication of a trailer like that, and of much of the buzz about Burr\u2019s special, is that it is a middle finger to civility, a takedown of PC culture. It\u2019s positioned as one more in the recent run of comedy specials that respond to straw men like \u201ccancel culture\u201d and \u201csafe spaces\u201d by deriding them, pushing back at audiences for their sensitivity and inability to take a joke. Cut into the trailer as it is, Burr\u2019s \u201cThis is gonna be my last show ever\u201d line sounds like he\u2019s about to be so provocative that he will never be allowed onstage again.\n\nThe opening of Paper Tiger feels like Burr leaning into exactly that proposition. For the first several minutes, he flips quickly through complaints about the overanalysis of jokes, how white women are to blame for the current lamentable state of culture in the United States, and jokes about disabled characters being played by able-bodied actors. In his biggest and most convincingly risky swing, the first few minutes include a bit about Michelle Obama. Burr, in full character as angriest man in the world, is not a Michelle fan. It is an opening segment that dares you to turn the special off in disgust \u2014 the kind of opening that makes the special\u2019s closing credit for executive producer Dave Becky utterly unsurprising. It is exactly what the trailer suggests Paper Tiger will be: furious, resentful troll comedy that plays like a toddler yelling the only swear word they know, desperately begging for someone to punish them.\n\nIt\u2019d be hard to blame anyone for turning Paper Tiger off at that point. Misbehaving toddlers grasping for parental boundaries are no one\u2019s idea of good company. The thing is that once Burr moves past that part of the special \u2014 once he gets through the sexist throat-clearing and the tick-the-box list of rebellious trollish vocab \u2014 the rest of the special is different.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look that different on the surface. Burr rags on his wife, calls sexual assault funny, and puts on a stupid voice and mocks male feminists. He makes fun of the idea that culture can be appropriated. He talks, wistfully, about a time where there will be high-quality sex robots so that women are no longer necessary. You could imagine versions of all of these jokes that are absolutely in keeping with the opening several minutes of his set, versions where they\u2019re jokes about victimhood or oversensitivity. In every one of them, though, Burr at some point flips the switch, and unspools the initial premise of the joke.\n\n\u201cSexual assault is funny,\u201d Burr begins, before telling a story about a woman touching him inappropriately before a show. In his telling it is funny, because he\u2019s quite capable of pointing out the absurdities of the situation. He plays up his futile inability to respond after the act, and how thoroughly he\u2019d be mocked if he tried to explain his discomfort to other men. \u201cEyyyyy flick my balls!\u201d Burr yells, in consummate character as a clueless asshole who Burr imagines laughing at this story about a man being assaulted by a woman. It becomes a joke about Burr wrestling with the intractable gender politics of vulnerability. It is a joke about how sexual assault has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with power. It\u2019s so far from his opening lines about how #MeToo has robbed men of due process that it feels like the message could\u2019ve come straight off an anti-Trump protest poster.\n\nAside from the opening several minutes, Burr\u2019s whole set is like that: thoughtful, surprising, introspective. He keeps yelling, of course, as if by bellowing his ideas while striding angrily around the stage he can distract from the fact that he\u2019s delivering jokes so sensitive that some border on sweetness. In one of my favorite sequences of the special, Burr dramatizes the experience of watching a documentary on Elvis together with his wife. While he watches along in interest, he notices that his wife, who\u2019s black, is making frustrated sounds at various moments of racism in the Elvis story. Burr turns his exchange with his wife into a canny stand-in for a clueless white troll arguing with a black interrogator, where Burr takes on the role of MAGA provocateur and his wife is the exasperated voice of the \u201cliberal elite.\u201d\n\nBurr, telling the story of this fight with his wife, describes himself trying to defend Elvis against accusations of racist cultural appropriation. Sure, Elvis may have stolen his dance move from a black person, but where did that guy get it? Why is it \u201ccarrying on the tradition\u201d if the move was adopted by a black person, but \u201cstealing\u201d if Elvis does it? A lesser joke could easily end there, passing off that anemic observation as a comedic insight. But Burr goes on, first voicing his wife\u2019s explanation that Elvis reaped endless profit and cultural acclaim while the original innovators did nothing, and then his admission that yes, she is right. He then goes on to spin the joke again, digging deeper into his own humiliation and then landing on a punchline that, almost miraculously, reinstates his ability to control a joke while also mocking his original cluelessness.\n\nPaper Tiger is primarily fueled by shame \u2014 by Burr\u2019s own shame in himself and his efforts to be a better person for his family and his own future. Over and over again, in his jokes about his childhood, marriage, his dog, and even his extended bit about sex robots, Burr probes the damage done by his own shame and emotional repression. The first several minutes of the special make it seem as though the paper tiger of the show\u2019s title will be the overly sensitive audience, or snowflake culture, or women in general \u2014 scary, toothy beasts who will crumple at the slightest pressure. In the next 50 minutes, though, it\u2019s clear that the paper tiger is Burr, roaring with all his might and then explaining exactly how embarrassed he is by his own fragility. It\u2019s frustrating that Burr feels the need to start by roaring so aggressively, because anyone who showed up to see a tiger is actually getting something subtler and more carefully crafted.", "description": "A review of comedian Bill Burr\u2019s new Netflix stand-up special, \u2018Paper Tiger,\u2019 in which he gets surprisingly thoughtful, surprising, and introspective.", "authors": ["Kathryn Vanarendonk"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/10-bill-burr-paper-tiger.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
