AFP/Getty Images 3/30 Paying tribute to where the luxury fashion label began, Chanel's autumn/winter 2017/2018 haute couture show featured a scale-model of the Eiffel Tower in the middle of the catwalk. The Parisian landmark inspired the designs that Lagerfeld presented on the catwalk, with a range of similarly shaped dresses and coats. AFP/Getty Images 4/30 In May 2018, Chanel set sail by presenting a 148-metre ship as part of a catwalk show at the Grand Palais. It took a month to install the ship inside the historic site. AFP/Getty Images 5/30 Chanel's SS18 in October 2017 show took a trip to the tropics. Models walked in the Grand Palais against a backdrop of waterfalls. 'Waterfalls are the healthiest thing in the world,' Lagerfeld said after the show. Getty Images 6/30 While snow was falling outside the Grand Palais, the setting of Chanel's spring/summer 2019 haute couture show transported its audience to sunny Italy. Models walked against a backdrop of an Italian villa, complete with a superbly primmed garden and luxurious pool. AFP/Getty Images 7/30 The Grand Palais was transformed into a beach for Chanel's spring/summer show in October 2018 during Paris Fashion Week. The set included a tidal machine, which made the water lap waves, and Chanel lifeguards sitting in a wooden beach hut. AFP/Getty Images 8/30 Chanel's autumn/winter 2018 forest-inspired show from March 2018 was definitely one of its eeriest, complete with towering trees and a floor strewn with fallen leaves. Getty Images 9/30 What better way to blast off a fashion show than placing a rocket at the centre of the catwalk? Some might say that Chanel's autumn/winter 2017 fashion show in Paris was out of this world... AFP/Getty Images 10/30 Chanel's spring/summer 2016 environmentally conscious haute couture show was extremely serene, set in a wooden pavilion with a beautiful green lawn and water lily ponds. One of the dresses displayed at the show was made entirely from wild cotton, Lagerfeld said. 'This is high-fashion ecology,' he added. 'It must not look like some sloppy demonstration!' AFP/Getty Images 11/30 In 2015 Chanel invited its audience to fly away, presenting a catwalk in the Grand Palais inspired by an airport terminal. In Lagerfeld's opinion, his vision was how an airport terminal 'should' look. AFP/Getty Images 12/30 In 2015, the French fashion label enlisted the help of stars including Kristen Stewart, Julianne Moore and Lara Stone to create an astounding casino-themed show in the Grand Palais. Card tables were placed in the centre of the room, while guests watched the show from the sides of the room. Getty Images 13/30 While some may opt to go to the supermarket in their comfiest clothes, in 2014 Lagerfeld showed that a trip to the vegetable aisle doesn't have to be an unfashionable affair. The juxtaposition between the luxurious clothing being worn by the models and the food produce on the shelves of the set made this catwalk one of Chanel's most memorable. Getty Images 14/30 Chanel's show on 10 March at Paris Fashion Week was a luxurious affair, involving models Kendall Jenner and Cara Delevingne walking around a French brasserie as part of the catwalk. Getty Images 15/30 Taking inspiration from the art world, Lagerfeld had custom-made artworks placed around the Chanel catwalk in the Grand Palais as part of the brand's show at Paris Fashion Week in October 2013. These artworks included a robot made from bottles of Chanel No 5 and a quilted sumo wrestler. Getty Images 16/30 The world was seemingly Chanel's oyster in March 2013, as Lagerfeld had a 50ft globe at the centre of the catwalk during the French labels show at Paris Fashion Week. Every one of Chanel's 310 international stores were marked on the globe with a double CC-logo-ed flag. Getty Images 17/30 Chanel's haute couture spring/summer 2013 show at the Grand Palais in January 2013 bore strong elements of fantasy, having models dressed in angelic white and floral prints walking among a spectacular forest scene. Here, two models accompany Hudson Kroenig, Lagerfeld's godson, on the catwalk. AFP/Getty Images 18/30 The beneficial impact of renewable energy on the environment was highlighted by Chanel in 2012, when Lagerfeld had a series of wind turbines places on the runway of the spring/summer 2013 show at the Grand Palais. Getty Images 19/30 In March 2012 Lagerfeld transformed the set of his Chanel show at the Grand Palais into the 'Fortress of Solitude', having models walk amid magnificent crystalline sculptures. AFP/Getty Images 20/30 Who doesn't wish they could walk down the airplane aisle like a catwalk model when jetting off on holiday? At the Chanel spring/summer 2012 haute couture show on 24 January 2012, guests at the Grand Palais were transfixed as the catwalk took place within the confines of a plane. AFP/Getty Images 21/30 In 2011, Chanel put on its extravagant 'Paris-Bombay' M\u00e9tiers d'Art show. Lagerfeld took inspiration from India with his designs, decorating the tables that surrounded the catwalk with a grand feast. AFP/Getty Images 22/30 In 2011, Chanel's ready-to-wear spring/summer 2012 catwalk was made even more entrancing by the accompanying performance of singer Florence Welch. Welch sung while standing inside a seashell, with the rest of the set designed to look like the bottom of a sea bed. Getty Images 23/30 Chanel's haute couture show at the Grand Palais on 5 July had a very dark feel, set in what looked like a dystopian Metropolis. AFP/Getty Images 24/30 Chanel had a roaring presence at Paris Fashion Week in 2011, as models walked underneath the shadow of a gigantic gold lion. The set was designed by Stefan Lubrina, and the lion was reported to have weighed eight tonnes. Getty Images 25/30 The models walking the catwalk for Chanel on 9 March 2010 channelled their inner ice queens as they walked among replicas of icebergs in Paris. 'Nature has its surprises,' Lagerfeld said at the time. AFP/Getty Images 26/30 Chanel's spring/summer 2010 show at Paris Fashion Week in 2009 was fairly surreal, featuring a custom-made barn and a performance by Lily Allen on the catwalk. Getty Images 27/30 In 2008 Lagerfeld recreated Chanel's building at number 31 on Rue Cambon in Paris, presenting the facade at the end of the catwalk. The building was the apartment in which Coco Chanel once lived, before becoming a flagship for the brand. AFP/Getty Images 28/30 Chanel took a trip to the fairground in 2008, placing a high fashion carousel at the centre of the catwalk. Instead of horses on the merry-go-round, Lagerfeld featured signature quilted handbags, pearls and bows. AFP/Getty Images 29/30 Sometimes a simple set design can be far more striking than an extravagant one, as displayed at the Chanel haute couture show in Paris on 6 July 2006. Getty Images 30/30 Chanel's spring/summer 2007 show, presented on 6 October 2006, was an undoubtable feast for the eyes. Featuring a grand spiral staircase, the French fashion house definitely took its ambitious set designs to new heights.
