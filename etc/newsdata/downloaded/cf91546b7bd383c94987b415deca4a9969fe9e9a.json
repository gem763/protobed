The suit comes on the heels of a pair of recent books that detail Weinstein and his team's efforts to keep his accusers quiet.\n\n\"Harvey Weinstein was able to perpetrate and cover up decades of violence and control over women because he had a sophisticated team working on his behalf to systematically silence and discredit his victims,\" McGowan said in a statement. \"My life was upended by their actions, and I refuse to be intimidated any longer.\"\n\nWeinstein's attorney Phyllis Kupferstein said McGowan is \"a publicity seeker looking for money\" and her suit is meritless.\n\n\"From the moment she sought a $6 million dollar payout in return for not making these baseless allegations, which we rejected at the time, we knew that she was waiting for an opportune time such as this to begin her suit,\" Kupferstein said.", "description": "Actress Rose McGowan filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday alleging that Harvey Weinstein and two of his former attorneys engaged in racketeering to silence her and derail her career before she accused him of rape.", "authors": ["Our Foreign Staff", "Rupert Christiansen", "Allister Heath"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213926778-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
