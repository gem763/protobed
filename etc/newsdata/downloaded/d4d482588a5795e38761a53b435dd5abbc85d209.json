The link has drawn the threat of sanctions from the U.S., which wants Europe to buy its liquefied natural gas. It risks reigniting a feud between Donald Trump and Danish lawmakers that erupted in the summer after the U.S. president\u2019s offer to buy Greenland.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the pipeline decision. \u201cDenmark showed itself to be a responsible participant in international relations, defending its interests and sovereignty and the interests of its main partners in Europe,\u201d he told a briefing in Budapest, where he was on a visit.\n\nThe green light gives Gazprom PJSC, Russia\u2019s gas export champion and already Europe\u2019s biggest supplier, yet another route to one of the world\u2019s most liquid gas markets. While Trump has accused Russia of using its natural gas as a political weapon, it\u2019s ultimately a commercial deal over which Washington has little influence, according to Raffaello Pantucci, Director of Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frankly too far advanced,\u201d Pantucci said. \u201cWho are they going to sanction?\u201d\n\nThe approval also gives Russia more clout in ongoing talks with Ukraine on a new gas transit deal, increasing the risk of a disruption from Jan. 1. Uncertainty about whether those two nations can agree on time has been weighing on forward prices in Europe and sending incentives for traders to stockpile gas as a cushion against disruption.\n\n\u201cIf Gazprom are confident in Nord Stream 2\u2019s imminent completion, it may encourage a tougher negotiating stance on any new Ukrainian transit deal,\u201d said John Twomey, a gas analyst at BloombergNEF in London. \u201cIf anything, the risks of a disruption on Jan. 1 have gone up as a result of this.\u201d\n\nThe pipeline has divided EU governments, with nations led by Poland concerned about the bloc\u2019s increasing dependence on Russian gas.\n\n\u201cIt is not too late to stop NS2,\u201d an official at the U.S. embassy in Germany said. \u201cThere are clear negative energy security and geopolitical implications for Europe from Putin\u2019s pipeline. The U.S. government agrees with the European Parliament, the U.S. House and nearly 20 European countries in our opposition to NS2.\u201d\n\nRussia, Ukraine, Europe Pledge New Gas Deal by Year-End\n\nDenmark said on Wednesday it will allow the pipeline to pass southeast of the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The company behind the pipeline submitted the route plan in April. Denmark had been conducting a security and environmental review of the project.\n\nTrump had objected to the link, instead urging the European Union to diversify the sources of its energy and dilute Putin\u2019s economic influence over the region. U.S. officials have also warned that project partners are at an elevated risk of U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe approval is another snub of Trump by the Nordic country after it ruled out his proposal to buy Greenland this summer. The president responded by canceling a state visit to Denmark.\n\nThe Danish approval covers 147 kilometers (91 miles) of the project. Nord Stream 2 said in its statement that it has already completed 87%, or 2,100 kilometers, of the pipeline in Russian, Finnish and Swedish waters as well as most of the German part. Dan Jorgensen, Denmark\u2019s minister for climate, energy and utilities, declined to comment on Wednesday.\n\nNord Stream 2 said it will continue its \u201cconstructive cooperation with the Danish authorities to complete the pipeline.\u201d\n\nSix Weeks\n\nGazprom CEO Alexey Miller said that the pipeline is expected to be completed on time by the end of the year. \u201cThe remaining 147 kilometers -- that\u2019s five weeks of work,\u201d Miller told reporters in Budapest.\n\nA statement from the company highlighted some uncertainties in that timetable. Nord Stream 2 said Wednesday the actual start of the construction depends on a number of legal, technical and environmental factors, which will \u201ctake a few weeks\u201d and the project aims for completion \u201cin the coming months.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- In a major boost for Russia\u2019s effort to tighten its grip over natural gas supplies to western Europe, Denmark said it will allow the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to pass through its territory.The decision removes the last important hurdle for the $11 billion project, which is slated", "authors": ["Morten Buttler", "William Wilkes", "Anna Shiryaevskaya"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uGpg_J5qK8PXltYLGGmfBA--~B/aD0xMTYyO3c9MTI5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/8d050649bb239d85b781523be18851b7", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
