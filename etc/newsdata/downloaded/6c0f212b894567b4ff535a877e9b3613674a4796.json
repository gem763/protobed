The overall shipping-focused transportation and logistics sector, excluding passenger and sightseeing companies, contracted by 600 jobs.\n\nCourier and messenger companies that deliver packages to homes and businesses added 3,900 jobs, while warehousing and storage businesses, including fulfillment centers that process online orders, added 1,000 jobs in August. Those gains come as a divide between the U.S. industrial and consumer economies has been growing in recent months.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nRoad and rail carriers focused on industrial transport are grappling with softening shipping demand and a contraction in manufacturing operations that pushes freight through logistics networks.\n\nBroader U.S. employment grew modestly in August, adding 130,000 positions including 25,000 temporary Census workers. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7% for the third straight month and average hourly earnings rose 3.2% from August 2018.\n\nGoods-producing companies contributed just 12,000 jobs, however, and employment in manufacturing rose by only 3,000 jobs. The transportation equipment sector accounted for nearly a quarter of those gains, although truck manufacturers have said they expect production to slow in coming months.\n\nOrders for heavy-duty Class 8 trucks fell 79% in August from the prior year, according to transportation data provider ACT Research. Production rates are dropping as truck makers work through backlogs from 2018. ACT expects equipment makers to build 238,000 units next year for the North American market, a 31% drop in production from the 2019 forecast.\n\nTruck maker Navistar International Corp. will slow production at some of its plants because of declining U.S. and export orders and a falling backlog, finance chief Walter Borst said in a Sept. 4 earnings call.\n\nThe company plans to lay off about 136 unionized workers at a Springfield, Ohio, plant that makes medium-duty trucks, said Chris Blizard, president of United Auto Workers Local 402.\n\nA Navistar spokeswoman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cIf history is a guide there will be layoffs up and down the truck manufacturing supply chain as a result of falling demand, exacerbating the need to draw inventories down,\u201d ACT president and senior analyst Kenny Vieth said.\n\nOn the road, big trucking companies are signaling they are more interested in maintaining pricing leverage gained amid surging demand in 2018 than in expanding capacity.\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line Inc., one of the country\u2019s largest less-than-truckload carriers, said in a mid-quarter operating update on Wednesday that its average daily shipment count declined by 4% in August from the same month a year ago but that revenue per hundredweight, a measure of pricing, expanded by 6.1%, excluding fuel surcharges.\n\n\u201cWe remained committed to our disciplined yield management process,\u201d ODFL Chief Executive Greg Gantt said.\n\nRamped-up U.S. consumer spending is providing a counterweight to the manufacturing slowdown. Retail sales and personal-consumption expenditures both rose in July.\n\nDemand for local delivery drivers and distribution workers remains strong, with employers having trouble recruiting and retaining staff, said Melissa Hassett, vice president of client delivery for ManpowerGroup Solutions Recruitment Process Outsourcing, a subsidiary of staffing company agency ManpowerGroup Inc.\n\nLast year an extra $1 an hour was enough to attract drivers and warehouse workers, Ms. Hassett said. \u201cNow it needs to be a dollar plus scheduling flexibility or training opportunities,\u201d she said.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nTransportation data provider ACT Research expects North American production of heavy-duty Class 8 trucks to drop 31% in 2020.
