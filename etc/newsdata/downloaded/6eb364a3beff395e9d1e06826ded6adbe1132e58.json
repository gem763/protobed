Currently no traffic lights at the intersection of N. Bridge and Bridgway Blvd in Sausalito/Marin City. Please use caution and treat outages at traffic lights as 4-way stops. #MarinPSPS#pgeshutoffpic.twitter.com/ZVxJfyXOnj \u2014 Marin County Sheriff (@MarinSheriff) October 9, 2019\n\nThe power cut is being implemented out of fears that unusually high winds could bring lines down, sparking forest and scrub fires that could burn out of control. This summer, the company permanently retired a high-voltage line that sparked the worst wildfire in the state\u2019s history.\n\nAlso on rt.com Paradise lost: Terrifying bodycam VIDEO shows desperate escape from deadly Camp Fire\n\nThe Camp Fire killed 85 people and razed the town of Paradise in November 2018. One person remains unaccounted for. PG&E, which filed for bankruptcy in June, is facing $13 billion in claims from the fire\u2019s victims.\n\nThe company says power restoration will start on Thursday, but could continue into early next week, depending on conditions and line damage. PG&E is coming under heavy criticism for the cut online, with the company\u2019s name and the hashtags #pgeshutoff and #poweroutage all trending on Twitter.\n\nPublic anger has particularly focused on the company\u2019s apparent inability to bolster its own infrastructure against wind, and on how bizarre it is that a utilities company is even allowed to just shut off power to thousands of homes.\n\nFor anyone who still claims capitalism is an optimal system, 100k people in the Bay Area are about to lose power because PG&E has discovered that\u2019s cheaper than fixing their infrastructure \u2014 Andrew Shvarts (@Shvartacus) October 9, 2019 Hey, everybody, we are really sorry about not maintaining our infrastructure and burning down your cities and blowing up your neighborhoods. So to mitigate that, we're going to shut the power off. Your bill is still due on the 1st. Thanks. - PG&E #pgeshutoffhttps://t.co/1FYAY3f8gr \u2014 Rob Baker (@TweetsRob) October 8, 2019\n\nSome made light of the impending power outage, saying that waiting for it \u201cfeels like waiting for the start of the purge,\u201d and planning how they\u2019re going to commit \u201cthe perfect crime\u201d under cover of darkness.\n\nAs stores in the affected areas sell out of batteries, some people are just trying to make the best possible use of their remaining electricity supply:\n\nGotta take advantage of this hot shower before the PG&E shut down pic.twitter.com/qtIotspUmZ \u2014 Oswaldo Navarro (@oswaldo_navarro) October 9, 2019\n\nLike this story?
