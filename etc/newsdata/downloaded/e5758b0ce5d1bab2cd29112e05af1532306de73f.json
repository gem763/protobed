I keep thinking I\u2019m seeing the outcome \u2013 and then something happens that makes me believe maybe that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d said Frank Graves, head of political polling firm Ekos Research Associates.\n\nPart of the reason for the deadlock is a campaign which experts say was devoid of bold ideas from the two main parties, and was instead defined by self-inflicted wounds: images emerged showing Trudeau in blackface, while the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, was accused of concealing the fact that he also holds a US passport.\n\nCanada election: can Trudeau excite young voters let down by broken promises? Read more\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really been an absence of hard policy questions, even though it\u2019s supposed to be the \u2018climate change election\u2019. It\u2019s not like we don\u2019t have anything to talk about,\u201d said Lori Turnbull, a professor of political science at Dalhousie University. \u201cInstead, we spent much of the campaign talking about blackface, stupid things people said on Twitter and Andrew Scheer\u2019s citizenship.\u201d\n\nWhile the prime minister was quick to apologize over the blackface images, his rivals used the embarrassing revelations to accuse him of insincerity.\n\n\u201cMr Trudeau, you are a phoney and you\u2019re a fraud and you do not deserve to govern this country,\u201d said Scheer during one official debate.\n\nBut Scheer, a social conservative, was also forced to deflect accusations that a Conservative government would undermine access to abortion, after telling reporters he was anti-choice.\n\nHe also faced repeated questions over his commitment to LGBTQ+ rights, after the Liberal party highlighted his previous opposition to gay marriage.\n\nIn the final days of the campaign, Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the leftwing New Democratic party, surged following well-received debate performances. The 40-year-old Singh has been able to draw large crowds with his optimistic campaign \u2013 and robbed much of the Green party\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cSingh has come out of this election smelling like a rose,\u201d said Graves. \u201cHe\u2019s really put himself on the map.\u201d\n\nDespite the negative campaigning by both the Liberals and Conservatives, Trudeau has tried to centre the election around the environment, with the prime minister pitching himself as a climate leader facing down the Conservatives, who have pledged to repeal the country\u2019s carbon tax.\n\nNeither message, however, doesn\u2019t appear to be resonating with voters.\n\n\u201cIn an election where the government is going into its second term, it\u2019s often a referendum on governance. But I don\u2019t get that sense this time,\u201d said Turnbull. \u201cThis election is really about a fractured polity \u2013 and probably, a fractured parliament.\u201d\n\nTrudeau will be looking to protect his position in Ontario and Quebec, which command a majority of parliament\u2019s 338 seats.\n\nConservatives are expected to sweep much of the prairies, and are polling as high as 70% in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to produce many seats, but it\u2019s going to leave a lot of very angry people in Alberta and Saskatchewan if they don\u2019t see the outcome they\u2019re hoping for,\u201d said Graves.\n\nScheer\u2019s ability to make inroads in the suburbs outside Toronto could be decisive.\n\nAmong the individual races, many eyes will be on Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, two former Liberal rising stars who were ejected from the party in the fallout of the SNC Lavalin scandal. The pair are both hoping to retain their seats as independents.\n\nWith a hung parliament the most likely outcome, Canada\u2019s extensive \u2013 but unwritten \u2013 rules surrounding the Westminster system will come into play.\n\nScheer, who has rejected working with other parties in a minority government scenario, has staked out the position that the party with the most seats should be given the first chance at forming a government.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that in modern Canadian history, the party with the most seats forms the government, and that a prime minister who comes out of an election with fewer seats than another party, resigns,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the convention.\u201d\n\nExperts disagree, citing extensive precedent in which the governing party did not command the plurality of seats.\n\n\u201cThere is no truth to this suggestion by Andrew Scheer that there\u2019s a modern convention around the prime minister resigning if he doesn\u2019t come first,\u201d said Turnbull. \u201cThe prime minister is the prime minister until he resigns.\u201d", "description": "Forty days of campaigning may have knocked the shine off Justin Trudeau but no party appears likely to capture a majority", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/656e59e6a370196f678699661c358c5154462a85/0_9_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c92f11bc4eba6fc2e6198abff74ae0e4", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
