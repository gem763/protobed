The U.S. mistakenly believed they had killed him in a 2011 strike. They later targeted a man they believed was al-Asiri in a May 2012 strike, but he turned out to be another al-Qaeda leader.\n\nAs TIME wrote in 2013, the Obama administration believed al-Asiri was \u201cthe most dangerous terrorist in the world.\u201d He was connected to the failed \u201cunderwear bomb\u201d aboard a U.S.-bound flight on Christmas Day 2009, and allegedly built bombs that nearly detonated within two Chicago-bound international cargo planes in 2010. Al-Asiri also allegedly planned to blow up a U.S. airliner in 2012 around the anniversary of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden\u2019s death, but was stopped when the member chosen for the suicide mission turned out to be a double agent for the U.S. Per the White House statement, Al-Asiri also built a device used in an assassination attempt of the former Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cAl-Asiri\u2019s death significantly handicapped al-Qa\u2019ida in the Arabian Peninsula,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThe United States will continue to hunt down terrorists like al-Asiri until they no longer pose a threat to our great Nation.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The Kurds, part of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, control facilities holding about 11,000 ISIS detainees. If the Kurds abandon the detention camps to fight the Turkish military, thousands of ISIS operatives could escape, U.S. officials worry.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has faced criticism from members of his own party in Congress for his decision to withdraw troops from Syria\u2019s border with Turkey. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, usually a staunch defender of the President, called the move \u201ca major blunder\u201d that \u201ccuts against sound military and geopolitical advice.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned that \u201ca precipitous withdrawal\u201d of troops would benefit Russia, Iran and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and increase the risk that the Islamic State would \u201cregroup.\u201d\n\nWrite to Madeleine Carlisle at madeleine.carlisle@time.com.", "description": "Ibrahim al-Asiri, a senior al-Qaeda bomb maker, was killed two years ago in a U.S. operation in Yemen, the White House announced Thursday.", "authors": ["Madeleine Carlisle"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ibrahim-al-asiri.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C276px%2C1195px%2C625px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
