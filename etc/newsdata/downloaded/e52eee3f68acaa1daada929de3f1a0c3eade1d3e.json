Nothing I can do about it now, though. I wish they'd added a laugh track to it, because it sure is funny\".\n\nJohnston's own musical output had slowed in recent years and, following a farewell tour in 2017, he was largely confined to the family home.\n\n'Prolific output'\n\nHis brother, Dick Johnston, told the New York Times he had been treated for kidney issues shortly before his death.\n\n\"He was still productive, writing songs and drawing, and was just annoyed by his health more than anything,\" he said. \"It was just one thing after another.\"\n\nIn a statement posted on Facebook, Johnston's family remembered him as \"a friend to all\".\n\n\"Although he struggled with mental health issues for much of his adult life, Daniel triumphed over his illness through his prolific output of art and songs.\n\n\"He inspired countless fans, artists, and songwriters with his message that no matter how dark the day that \"the sun shines down on me\" and \"true love will find you in the end.\"\n\nImage copyright Rex Features Image caption The singer-songwriter [pictured in his youth] was known for his unfiltered lyrics, which spoke of depression and unrequited love\n\nAs news of his death spread, fans laid flowers and cassettes at the foot of his mural in Austin, while musicians and fellow creators spoke of Johnston's impact on their life.\n\n\"There are not enough words I can say about the vitality of Daniel Johnston's musical spirit,\" said musician Zola Jesus. \"He was a huge inspiration to me, to follow my creative impulses no matter how messy or simple.\"\n\nIndie band Death Cab For Cutie, who covered Johnston's song Dream Scream, wrote that their \"hearts were heavy\".\n\n\"His unique songwriting voice, so pure and so direct, spoke to us deeply,\" they continued. \"It is quite safe to say there will never be another like him and thankfully, his music will play on.\"\n\nDavid Bowie's son, Duncan Jones, tweeted: \"My dad introduced me to Daniel Johnston's music and at first I didn't know if it was meant as a joke or something else.\n\n\"But once I'd listened to a few songs, I heard the DNA of so many others' work. A unique and special human being. Rest peacefully, Daniel.\"\n\n\"Rest in peace... Living your broken dreams forever,\" added Avengers star Mark Ruffalo on Twitter. \"Thank you for your art.\"\n\nJohnston's family said plans for a memorial will be announced soon.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @mountain_goats Those early DJ tunes meant a lot to so many of us. \u201cWalking the Cow\u201d was also a favorite of mine, along with \u201cKeep Punching Joe,\u201d whose lyrics reference \u201cWalking the Cow.\u201d Rest well Daniel Johnston, you sure earned it. https://t.co/KVGvW210yB \u2014 The Mountain Goats (@mountain_goats) September 11, 2019 Report\n\nSkip Twitter post by @SSPU RIP Daniel Johnston.
