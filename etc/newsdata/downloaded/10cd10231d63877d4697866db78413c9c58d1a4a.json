Palacio's books have sold more than 16 million copies worldwide and her blockbuster YA novel, Wonder, is still on the New York Times bestsellers list six years after it was originally published.\n\nIt inspired the author to write a spin-off collection of stories called Auggie & Me. Now, Palacio has released her first graphic novel, called White Bird, which expands on one of those earlier stories.\n\nWhite Bird is a survival story told from the perspective of a young Jewish girl in Nazi-occupied France. She's forced to hide to survive with help from her classmate's family.\n\nPalacio joined q's Tom Power from New York to tell us more about White Bird and why she thinks her books resonate so strongly with young people.\n\nDownload our podcast or click 'Listen' near the top of this page to hear the full conversation with R.J.
