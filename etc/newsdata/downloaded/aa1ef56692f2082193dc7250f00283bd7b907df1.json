It was difficult to find things to celebrate in those early days of living separately. The realisation that our kids would have to turn their backs on one parent to go to the other seemed like an act of cruelty. But if I am making it all sound miserable, it wasn\u2019t. Now, a few years on, the kids are all right and my ex and I are far happier for going our separate ways. One of the biggest surprises of our split has been that having my own bed contributes to a large part of that happiness.\n\nOne day, I may live with someone again, and we probably won\u2019t have enough space or money to have our own bedrooms. I may learn to love the peeling clingfilm sensation of bodies parting in summer (although I can\u2019t imagine that I will). But, for now, I know there is a stretch of undisturbed hours waiting for me every night; there are lazy Sunday mornings when my children might not bring me a cup of coffee, but they won\u2019t disturb me before 10am, because I\u2019ve told them not to. When my bedroom door is shut, I can sack off sacrificing, do away with sharing, forget about anyone but myself.\n\nOf course, waking up in my king-size bed alone for the first time didn\u2019t trigger a spiritual awakening, or a moment of rapture. The joy of sleeping alone revealed itself more slowly, like the cautious removal of the winter duvet when spring arrives, a familiar warmth kissing the skin. Soon I was enjoying a succession of dead-to-the-world sleeps, unconscious from the moment of switching off my bedside lamp to the alarm razor-blading the morning air. I hadn\u2019t slept so well since my teens. I thought: is this how some people feel all the time?\n\nI\u2019ve shared my bed with someone for longer than I have not. Before marriage, I had always had a boyfriend, and we usually lived together. I was a young mother and my daughter and I slept together in our one-bed flat. I married and had two more kids.\n\nHow I finally learned to sleep Read more\n\nMy husband and I often woke with a small, sweaty child between us. To say that you have slept in such situations is stretching it: ill-thought-out manoeuvres in the dark left us all exhausted by morning. This stage where thoughts, hours and bodies merged into one another seemed to go on for ever, metastasising in a fuzziness that left me vague and useless for days at a time.\n\nNewly separated and the only adult in the house, I had to look after myself if I wanted to look after the children. I started to discover things that felt good and that didn\u2019t require cash, dating apps or a babysitter: a long bath; reading the papers in bed; and most important of all, sleep. I don\u2019t know how much of my love for my bed comes from the sleep or the new-found solitude in bed after a day of being surrounded by people. But it is the only place I can go that is exclusively mine.\n\nWhile I enjoy the warmth of my boyfriend's body next to mine, the waking up together in the morning is so much better than the actual sleep.\n\nThere are exceptions when I do share a bed, or sleep elsewhere. Who doesn\u2019t love the heft, bounce and wedge of a luxury hotel mattress, dressed in white, starchy sheets that have been washed by someone else?\n\nOccasionally, I will stay the night at my boyfriend\u2019s place. Having sex is something we enjoy more than sharing a bed, though, which is no problem because we\u2019re neighbours; we can almost hear each other breathe through the wall that separates our respective bedrooms.\n\nWhen I can\u2019t be bothered to schlep the 30 steps home, I stay put. While I enjoy the warmth of his body next to mine, waking up together in the morning is so much better than the actual sleep.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned from this relationship is that sex and sleeping in the same bed are not synonymous. My boyfriend and I are not cuddle-up-close types, anyway, and we both agree that we have deeper, longer sleeps on our own, free to move limbs this way and that and to claim all of the covers.\n\nOn the occasions that I\u2019ve lain awake next to a sleeping body at 3am, my loneliness is far more acute than when I am on my own. At least then I can switch on the light to read, without worrying about waking my bed partner. I have a far greater chance of staying sane when I have seven or eight undisturbed hours under my belt. And for now, that sleep feels far more attainable when I\u2019m alone.", "description": "For years I shared a bed, but after my marriage ended I had a place that was now exclusively mine \u2013 and where I could get eight hours of undisturbed sleep", "authors": ["Grace Ackroyd"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19ce707467a9e787a14def9e267a8bf4c2b885f2/0_33_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=935e870467ed125b6c6ff42cfbec4c0f", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
