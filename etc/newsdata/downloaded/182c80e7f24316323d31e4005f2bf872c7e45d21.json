REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - French airline XL Airways has called on Air France (AIRF.PA) to discuss a rescue deal to avert the collapse of the budget carrier that halted ticket sales and payments last week.\n\nXL Airways, which has said it needs 35 million euros ($38.6 million) in fresh financing, requested in a statement on Sunday a meeting with Air France and the French authorities in the coming hours before a court is expected to put it into receivership on Monday.\n\nIn an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche, also published on Sunday, XL Airways\u2019 Chief Executive Laurent Mignan said his airline could become Air France\u2019s low-cost offer on long-haul routes.\n\nAn Air France spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nAir France, France\u2019s historic national carrier, is part of the Air France-KLM group.\n\nXL Airways operated four Airbus A330 aircraft and provided mainly long-haul flights to the Caribbean, the United States and France\u2019s Reunion island.\n\nXL Airways\u2019 woes follow similar issues at French airline Aigle Azur. Aigle Azur\u2019s unfolding bankruptcy is the latest among smaller European airlines struggling to contend with higher fuel costs and stiff low-cost competition.\n\n($1 = 0.9077 euros)", "description": "French airline XL Airways has called on Air France to discuss a rescue deal to avert the collapse of the budget carrier that halted ticket sales and payments last week.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432565570&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L064", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
