It's an innovative pillowcase features a microfiber towel along with a waterproof liner underneath to dry your hair while you snooze.\n\nThe concept was dreamed up and launched by two Miami-based businesswomen and stay-at-home moms, Linda Schwitalla Villena and Susan Schwitalla Culmo.\n\nThe duo was inspired to launch their unique line of pillowcases after Villena noticed her daughter place a towel on her pillow after wetting her hair in the shower.\n\nOne side of the pillowcase is regular, while the other side is made of microfiber with a waterproof liner underneath. It can also be used to help solve bedtime woes such as night sweats, drooling, color-treated hair and everything in between.\n\nCurrently, there are 12 unique designs that include everything from popular sayings such as \"good night sleep tight\" to fun graphic designs that include eyelashes or polka dots. Prices start around $20, and you can easily snag one right on Amazon.", "description": "DryZzz is an innovative pillowcase that features absorbent microfiber.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/dryzzz-pillow-case-ht-jc-190903_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
