Dastagir wrote, \u201cMiller's memoir is an intensely specific account of the impact those 20 minutes had on her life, and on the lives of those closest to her. She writes exquisitely of her pain, makes us feel every fragment of it, but also expounds on the kindnesses that nourished her spirit along the way.\"\n\nMore: Jacqueline Woodson's 'Red at the Bone' a poignant generational tale of unplanned pregnancy\n\n3. \u201cThe Water Dancer,\u201d by Ta-Nehisi Coates (One World, fiction, on sale Sept. 24)\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: The National Book Award-winning author of \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d makes his fiction debut with a magical story told in soaring prose.
