(AP) - Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs won a showdown between two of the NFL\u2019s top offenses.\n\nThe Ravens made them work for it until the very end.\n\nMahomes threw for 374 yards and three touchdowns in another dazzling performance, Kansas City held quarterback Lamar Jackson in check most of the rain-soaked afternoon, and the Chiefs held on for a 33-28 victory over Baltimore on Sunday.\n\nLeSean McCoy and Darrel Williams combined for 116 yards rushing and a score in place of the injured Damien Williams, while the Chiefs (3-0) stopped the Ravens three times on 2-point attempts.\n\nThe last came after Jackson scrambled for a touchdown with 2:01 to go. The conversion would have gotten the Ravens (2-1) within a field goal, but Jackson was shoved out of bounds short of the pylon.\n\nBaltimore tried to get the ball back with a rare dropkick, but the Chiefs calmly called for a fair catch. Then they converted on third down moments later to run out the clock.\n\nMark Ingram was the Ravens\u2019 biggest bright spot, running for 103 yards and a trio of touchdowns while catching four passes for 32 yards. Jackson finished with 267 yards passing and 46 rushing, most of that when he was trying to rally the Ravens from a big halftime hole.\n\nThe Chiefs scored four times in the second quarter for the second consecutive week, this time getting three touchdowns and Harrison Butker\u2019s 42-yard field goal to take a 23-6 lead. They scored four TDs in the second quarter last week in Oakland .\n\nLIONS 27, EAGLES 24\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) - Matthew Stafford threw a touchdown pass to Marvin Jones, Jamal Agnew returned a kickoff 100 yards for a score and the Lions held on.\n\nThe Eagles had a chance after Malcolm Jenkins blocked Matt Prater\u2019s 46-yard field goal try with 1:53 left. Rasul Douglas returned it to the Lions 22, but an illegal block on Jenkins pushed it back to midfield.\n\nOn fourth-and-5, Darren Sproles caught a pass for a first down but got called for Philadelphia\u2019s third offensive pass interference. Carson Wentz\u2019s deep pass to J.J. Arcega-Whiteside fell incomplete with 41 seconds left.\n\nThe Lions (2-0-1) remain undefeated and the Eagles (1-2) have lost two in a row.\n\nJones had six catches for 116 yards, including a 12-yard TD reception that extended Detroit\u2019s lead to 27-17 on the first play of the fourth quarter.\n\nWentz threw a pair of touchdown passes to Nelson Agholor, but came up yards short on a scramble on fourth-and-8 late in the fourth.\n\nCOWBOYS 31, DOLPHINS 6\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Dak Prescott threw two touchdown passes to Amari Cooper before running for another score, and the Cowboys pulled out of a first-half funk as huge favorites.\n\nOne of Prescott\u2019s TD tosses to Cooper came before halftime, but the Dolphins had a great chance to lead at the break as 22-point underdogs. Kenyan Drake fumbled on first down from the Dallas 7-yard line in the final minute of the second quarter. DeMarcus Lawrence recovered to preserve a 10-6 lead.\n\nJosh Rosen was 18 of 29 for 200 yards without a touchdown or interception in his first start for Miami, which went with him over Ryan Fitzpatrick after getting outscored 102-10. No team since 1961 had a worse point differential through two games.\n\nThe rebuilding Dolphins are 0-3 for the first time since losing their first seven in 2011. They have been outscored 133-16, the largest point differential through three games in league history since 1950.\n\nPrescott fueled the first Dallas team in 41 years to win its first two games while rolling up at least 400 yards and at least 30 points each time. And while the Cowboys reached 3-0 for the first time since 2008, it took them awhile to find that offensive form.\n\nEzekiel Elliott had his second straight 100-yard game after missing the entire preseason holding out for the $90 million extension he signed the day of the first full workout before the regular season. Rookie Tony Pollard had his first 100-yard day (103), clinching it on a 16-yard run for his first touchdown.\n\nPACKERS 27, BRONCOS 16\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) - Aaron Rodgers threw for 235 yards and a touchdown, Aaron Jones tied a career high by running for two scores and Preston Smith matched a career high with three sacks. Green Bay got to Joe Flacco six times and forced three turnovers to lead the Packers (3-0) to the win despite being dominated in time of possession 35:34-24:26.\n\nRodgers found Marquez Valdes-Scantling on a 40-yard strike on the opening drive and finished 17 of 29. Jones\u2019 touchdown runs came from 1 yard and 7 yards.\n\nFlacco was 20 of 29 for 213 yards with an interception and no touchdowns. For the third straight game, Von Miller, Bradley Chubb and Denver\u2019s defense failed to get a sack or force a turnover. The Broncos (0-3) fell to 0-6-1 on the road against the Packers.\n\nBILLS 21, BENGALS 17\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) - Frank Gore scored on a 1-yard run with 1:50 remaining in rallying the Bills. Tight end Dawson Knox set up the score by bowling over two Bengals for a 49-yard gain. And cornerback Tre\u2019Davious White sealed the win by intercepting Andy Dalton\u2019s tipped pass on third-and-5 from Buffalo\u2019s 28 with 12 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Bills squandered a 14-0 lead and were forced to rally back after the Bengals scored 17 points to take the lead on three consecutive possessions.\n\nBuffalo improved to 3-0 for the first time since 2011 and only third time in 26 years. The Bengals fell to 0-3.\n\nFrank Gore also scored on a 1-yard run and finished 76 yards rushing.\n\nBills starter Josh Allen finished 23 of 36 for 243 yards with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Knox and a costly interception, which set up the Bengals\u2019 first touchdown. Allen was nearly picked off two more times and almost lost a fumble before being ruled he was out of bounds.\n\nBuffalo\u2019s defense came to the rescue after appearing winded on a hot afternoon with temperatures in the 80s. The Bills forced four turnovers, with White finishing with two interceptions.\n\nCOLTS 27, FALCONS 24\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Jacoby Brissett threw two touchdown passes in the first half and Marlon Mack scored on a 4-yard run in the fourth quarter. Indianapolis (2-1) has won two straight overall and seven in a row at home.\n\nThe Falcons (1-2) rallied from a 20-3 halftime deficit to get within three on Matt Ryan\u2019s 10-yard touchdown pass to Julio Jones with 4:11 to play. But the Falcons opted to kick deep and never got the ball back.\n\nBrissett closed it out with an 11-yard pass to Jack Doyle on third-and-4. He finished 28 of 37 with 310 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. T.Y. Hilton caught eight passes for 65 yards and a touchdown in the first half, but missed the second half after aggravating a quad injury that slowed him in practice this week.\n\nRyan was 29 of 34 with 340 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. He passed John Elway for ninth on the league\u2019s career completion list and broke a tie with Elway for No. 11 on the career TD passes list. Ryan now has 4,143 completions and 303 touchdown passes.\n\nPATRIOTS 30, JETS 14\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) - Tom Brady threw a pair of touchdown passes and the Patriots didn\u2019t allow an offensive touchdown for the third straight week.\n\nSony Michel and Rex Burkhead each added a rushing touchdown for the Patriots (3-0), who won their seventh straight over the Jets and earned their ninth consecutive regular-season win at home over their AFC East rival.\n\nIt was the Patriots\u2019 first game since releasing receiver Antonio Brown. The four-time All-Pro was cut by the team on Friday after a second woman accused him of sexual misconduct. Brown\u2019s absence didn\u2019t slow New England against a Jets team that was without starting quarterback Sam Darnold, still recovering from mononucleosis, and injured linebacker C.J. Mosley and defensive lineman Quinnen Williams. They seemed lost at times on defense and struggled to move the ball offensively - going 0 for 12 on third down - against the Patriots\u2019 top-ranked defense in quarterback Luke Falk\u2019s first NFL start.\n\nBrady was 28 of 42 for 306 yards and headed to the sideline with 8:41 left in the fourth quarter and New England leading 30-7. He was briefly replaced by rookie Jarrett Stidham, who completed his first two passes before having his third intercepted and returned for a touchdown by Jamal Adams. Brady returned the following series.\n\nSuper Bowl MVP receiver Julian Edelman left with a chest injury.\n\nVIKINGS 34, RAIDERS 14\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - NFL rushing leader Dalvin Cook cruised past the 100-yard mark for the third straight game, while Kirk Cousins rebounded from his rattled performance the week before with a turnover-free afternoon.\n\nThe defense had plenty to do with the victory, too. An interception by Harrison Smith of an overthrow by Oakland\u2019s David Carr set up the second of two touchdowns by Adam Thielen to give the Vikings a 21-0 lead early in the second quarter. Eric Wilson had two of Minnesota\u2019s four sacks.\n\nCook had 16 carries for 110 yards and a score in just three quarters, and his backups capably grabbed the baton. Rookie Alexander Mattison got his first NFL touchdown as the Vikings (2-1) rushed for 211 yards and didn\u2019t even attempt a fourth-quarter pass for the second time in two home games. Last week in a loss at Green Bay, Cousins had three turnovers, including a first-and-goal interception in the end zone.\n\nCousins enjoyed a sack-free game for the first time in his Vikings career and finished a crisp 15 for 21 for 174 yards and one score to Thielen on their opening possession. That throw covered 35 yards, a rollout away from the play-action when he planted in front of a pressuring defensive tackle P.J. Hall and zipped the ball across the field, where Thielen was racing past safety Curtis Riley. That was one of three touchdown drives of 75-plus yards, and Thielen scored later on an inside handoff off a jet sweep at the goal line.\n\nDerek Carr went 27 for 34 for 242 yards and touchdowns to J.J. Nelson and Tyrell Williams for Oakland (1-2)\n\n____\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs won a showdown between two of the NFL's top offenses.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/ravens_chiefs_football_89887_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
