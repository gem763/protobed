Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa \u2014 There was a strange atmosphere at the edge of Africa. Cloudless skies and balmy spring breezes greeted the delegations of regional and business leaders who met last week for a major annual summit on the future of the continent. But they gathered in a city reeling from trauma.\n\nAfter news emerged of the violent rape and murder of a student at the prestigious University of Cape Town, protesters massed at the gates of the convention center where the World Economic Forum was being held. Their ire over \u201cgender-based\u201d violence compounded the sense of tension smoldering elsewhere in the country, which has seen a resurgence of xenophobic attacks by local mobs on foreign migrants and shopkeepers.\n\nI condemn the violence that has been spreading around a number of our provinces in the strongest terms. I\u2019m convening the ministers in the security cluster today to make sure that we keep a close eye on these acts of wanton violence and find ways of stopping them. pic.twitter.com/sizZkwIyPO \u2014 Cyril Ramaphosa \ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 (@CyrilRamaphosa) September 3, 2019\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa had to break away from the forum\u2019s proceedings to address the protesters\u2019 concerns in a session of Parliament. But he returned the next day to extol the virtues of a potentially monumental African free-trade pact, stitched together over more than a year of diplomatic effort to little fanfare elsewhere in the world. The optimism of the World Economic Forum would not be dimmed by the unease outside its halls.\n\nThe deal is \u201cgoing to be the greatest opportunity for economies on the continent to generate growth through trade,\u201d Ramaphosa said.\n\nOn paper, that seems true. After Nigeria signed on to the African Continental Free Trade Area on the sidelines of the African Union summit in July, investors, wonks and politicians all started to dream of what may follow: a $3.4 trillion economic zone of some 1.3 billion people. In a report earlier this year, the International Monetary Fund dubbed the free-trade deal a \u201cgame changer\u201d if African governments are able to bring down tariffs and boost trade within the continent.\n\nA deal that ushers in a successful, more integrated Africa would make the region a \u201cfood basket to the rest of the world,\u201d present a \u201chuge consumer base\u201d attractive to global investors, stem migration flows to Europe and help bring political stability to parts of the continent, said Saif Malik, head of Africa banking for Standard Chartered.\n\nIt also would buck a global trend. \u201cWith all the trade tensions that are going on between the U.S. and China, Africa is trying to find its own homegrown solution,\u201d Malik told Today\u2019s WorldView.\n\nThat was a view shared widely in Cape Town this past week. \u201cWe need to all acknowledge and celebrate the fact that as the rest of the world is raising barriers and building walls, Africa has decided to embrace change,\u201d Albert Zeufack, the World Bank\u2019s chief Africa economist, said at a plenary session at the forum.\n\nBut Zeufack, Malik and many other experts offered plenty of cautionary notes, too. Major obstacles remain before a pact stitching together more than 50 disparate nations across a vast landmass could even start to look like anything resembling the European Union. Beyond the sizable political and bureaucratic hurdles standing between governments and the implementation of the deal, there are broader challenges vexing African economies.\n\nBy some calculations, the continent needs to generate a million jobs a month to satisfy the demands of a booming generation of young people desperate for employment \u2014 and to ensure that what could be a demographic dividend doesn\u2019t become a dangerous liability. Africa needs an estimated $90 billion-100 billion a year in investment in infrastructure, including a huge expansion of its woeful power supply. And it needs to achieve all this while also reckoning with the ravages of climate change: As Africa\u2019s energy and agricultural exports go up, it\u2019ll remain the most vulnerable continent in the world to extreme weather patterns caused by global warming.\n\nAnalysts also warned that the free-trade deal may disproportionately benefit a few relatively rich nations with an existing industrial base, like South Africa, over smaller countries with less developed economies. Income gaps within the continent\u2019s countries may also get exacerbated.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\n\nJust the top 3 billionaires in Africa have more wealth than the poorest 50% of the continent, close to 650 million people.\n\n\n\nFair?\n\n\n\nRead our latest report on inequality in Africa \ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/ByedYVYAxl#AF19 #FightInequality pic.twitter.com/BV0s30eQw2 \u2014 Oxfam International (@Oxfam) September 7, 2019\n\n\u201cWe need to learn from trade in the era of globalization, trade that was inextricably linked to a race to the bottom on regulation. In an era without rules nor referees, the rich bullies took charge to take most of the spoils,\u201d Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International, told Today\u2019s WorldView. \u201cRicher countries, richer companies and richer people gained most from liberalized trade.\u201d\n\nByanyima\u2019s organization serves as the town crier at the World Economic Forum\u2019s various annual events, warning the global jet-setting elites of the yawning divides their policies have created. A free-trade deal, Byanyima added, \u201cwill be great for Africa only if it reduces economic inequality and creates good quality jobs, especially for women and for our young people.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s to be done? Many of the African attendees at the forum expressed exasperation with the continent\u2019s political elites. \u201cThe young people who are out there are extremely angry,\u201d said Oby Ezekwesili, a prominent former Nigerian politician and civil society activist. She argued that the steady progress of a Pan-African trade pact meant little if political leaders didn\u2019t confront the systemic problems within their societies. \u201cWe have a problem of bad politics on the continent.\u201d\n\nThe conference\u2019s solution for this is now familiar: A focus on the myriad innovative projects and business initiatives \u2014 from solar tech to micro-electricity grids to digital banking to companies that seed clouds with artificial rain \u2014 that are pushing the continent forward despite its laggard governments.\n\nBut geopolitics is never far away. A more integrated African market only raises the stakes for what some have dubbed a new \u201cscramble\u201d for Africa. China\u2019s ever-expanding footprint on the continent has provoked frequent complaints of neocolonialism. But there\u2019s also been a flurry of recent investment and engagement from India, Japan, Turkey and Brazil, as well as the major powers of the West. This, ultimately, may be a boon for Africa.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about the word \u2018scramble,\u2019 it\u2019s to make the assumption that people on the continent are uninvolved and uninterested,\u201d said Frannie L\u00e9autier, Nairobi-based chief operating officer of the Trade and Development Bank. She argued that is far from the case now: \u201cAfrica is wiser. Africa is learning. Africa is choosing.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
