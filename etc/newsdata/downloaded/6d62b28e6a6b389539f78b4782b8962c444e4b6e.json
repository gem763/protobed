Net debt will fall to about $54.6 million.\n\nExecutive chairman Peter George, who was appointed late last year to help turn the struggling company around, hailed the upsized raising and thanked investors for their support.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted with the support received for the placement, and welcome a number of highly credentialled and supportive institutional investors to the shareholder register,\" Mr George said.\n\n\"The recapitalisation is transformational for the RFG business and will allow the RFG team to continue to harness the underlying value of the franchise network and enhance franchisee profitability.\u201d\n\nRFG expects underlying earnings before interest and tax, depreciation and amortisation to fall by at least 9.3 per cent and by as much as 17 per cent to between $42 million and $46 million this year.\n\nThe group lost $150 million in 2019 after booking another $185.3 million in \u00adimpairments and provisions. This followed losses of $306.7 million in 2018.\n\nRFG plans to close more than 120 stores by mid- 2020, after closing 330 stores in 2019, taking its network to about 827 outlets.", "description": "The owner of Michel's Patisserie and Donut King now plans to raise $190 million, up from $160 million last week, after strong support from investors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2744%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_55/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/372a26b31b79ef5ef9644300fb5d5758e00c0631", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
