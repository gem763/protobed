The husband is yet to make a statement on the allegations.\n\nMany Indians regard fair skin as being superior to darker tones.\n\nThe woman's father told police that her husband used to \"repeatedly humiliate her over her dark complexion\", which led her to kill herself.\n\nThis is not the first time that taunts over \"dark complexion\" have allegedly caused Indian women to kill themselves.\n\nA 29-year-old woman killed herself in 2014 after her husband taunted her over her skin colour.\n\nAnd in 2018, a 14-year-old girl took her own life after her classmates bullied her and called her \"ugly\" because she was \"dark\".\n\nIndia's 'dangerous obsession'\n\nBy Geeta Pandey, BBC News in Delhi\n\nThis tragic incident once again shows just how dangerous India's obsession with skin colour is.\n\nFrom a young age, girls with darker skin tones are called derogatory names. They are bullied in schools, on playgrounds, and even within homes, where unflattering comparisons are made with siblings who may have a fairer complexion.\n\nIn matrimonial columns, skin colour is almost always emphasised - prospective brides are described as being fair, wheat-ish, light or dark brown, but almost never as dark.\n\nPopular media constantly reinforces that image with touched up photographs of actors and models.\n\nAnd this makes many women with darker skin tones grow up feeling inadequate, even ugly.\n\nRules bar commercials from showing people with darker skin colour as unattractive or unhappy, and in recent years advertisements have become a bit more subtle but, at the end of the day, the message they still give is that fairer is better.\n\nIn the past few years, there have been some counter-campaigns calling people to celebrate dark skin, but clearly a lot more needs to be done to increase the reach of this message.\n\nUntil that happens, such discriminatory attitudes will continue to ruin lives.\n\nIf you've been affected by a mental health issue, help and support is available.
