Why go anywhere else? But I really believe they now need to buy a commanding centre back.\n\nThere was a clamour to get another A-list European manager \u2014 maybe pay Tottenham for Maurico Pochettino \u2014 but who can guarantee they would get it right?\n\nIt could take millions in compensation and another two years. We\u2019ve already been playing catch-up to Manchester City and Liverpool for too long.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer signed a three-year contract as Man United manager on Thursday\n\nOle has earned his chance and United would be better off spending any millions earmarked for compensation on world-class players to strengthen his hand.\n\nI know he has indicated he doesn\u2019t need a new centre back, but that\u2019s where I\u2019d disagree.\n\nSure, Ole has improved the defending, but we\u2019ve seen the impact Virgil van Dijk has had on Liverpool this season.\n\nA signing of that magnitude, a commanding leader could catapult United forward.\n\nYou can see the confidence Van Dijk brings to Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeper Alisson, his fellow defenders and midfielders.\n\nThat\u2019s the type of player United need to sign. A strong summer of recruitment could be the making of Ole\u2019s legacy \u2014 not necessarily players in quantity, but world-class quality.\n\nVirgil van Dijk has vastly improved Liverpool \u2014 he is the type of player United need to sign\n\nHe has the balance of the team right, the players are on side with his methods and the youngsters believe they have a chance if they work hard enough \u2014 as is the traditional culture of the club.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean \u2018get the players on side because they have the power\u2019, but if you get them happy in their job and environment you should get the best out of them.\n\nThat has been borne out in results so far and three new signings would take them up another level.\n\nWhether Ole lasts longer than David Moyes, Louis van Gaal or Jose Mourinho no one can say for sure, but the signs are more promising.\n\nI have heard the rumblings that he could slip back into the mode of what happened in Cardiff, but that argument doesn\u2019t hold water for me. Firstly, he has better players. Secondly he is wiser. And thirdly the nature of away wins at Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain, all top teams, plus the draw against Liverpool \u2014 when key injuries disrupted the game \u2014 show he has more to offer this time round.\n\nSolskjaer, seen posing at Old Trafford, seems to have a good, authoritative manner about him\n\nOle\u2019s his own man but he is a humble guy, not afraid to take advice and listen to those around him. I\u2019ve not seen a lot of him at the training ground but, from what I have seen, he has a good, authoritative manner about him at the sessions.\n\nHe stands at the side, observing it all and then pulls a player aside quietly to discuss what he may be doing and how he could do it better. There\u2019s no shouting in front of everyone and the players appreciate that.\n\nHe\u2019s got the hallmarks of the gaffer, Sir Alex Ferguson, in that approach. He lets them down gently when they are not in the team \u2014 but underlines each one is still important. It is good man-management.\n\nSolskjaer has brought the feel-good factor back to United and deserves his new contract\n\nYou talk to the staff whether on the football or commercial side and they enjoy working with him. He understands the demands of the club.\n\nBringing in a different manager would have meant big changes behind the scenes too. A new boss would have brought seven to 15 different staff and that\u2019s all very unsettling.\n\nTaking the decision to appoint him now is a clever one as it gives players and staff the incentive to finish this campaign strongly.\n\nOle is THE boss. He has put a smile on the face of United\u2019s players again and now they can underline why they should still be at the club in the summer by finishing in the top four of the Premier League and claiming a Champions League place.\n\nBryan Robson talked to Simon Jones", "description": "INSIGHT - BRYAN ROBSON: strong summer of recruitment could be the making of Ole\u2019s legacy \u2014 not necessarily players in quantity, but world-class quality.", "authors": ["Bryan Robson For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/03/28/20/11586002-0-image-a-44_1553803759660.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-28"}
