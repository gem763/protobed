REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nSwiss prosecutors said in February that they had closed an inquiry into Teodoro Nguema Obiang for money-laundering and misappropriation of public assets with an arrangement to sell the cars to fund social programs in the former Spanish colony.\n\nTwenty-six Ferraris, Lamborginis, Bentleys, and Rolls-Royces owned by the vice president and former agriculture minister known as Teodorin are displayed at Bonmont golf and country club in the Swiss village of Cheserex, 30 km (19 miles) from Geneva, ahead of Sunday\u2019s sale.\n\nIn all, 75 prestige cars, mostly post-war, will be on the block at a 12th-Century abbey where telephone banks await bidders.\n\n\u201cWe do have a collection of cars from the state of Geneva. It\u2019s a great setting,\u201d James Knight, Group Chairman of Bonhams Motoring Department who will conduct the auction, told Reuters.\n\nBilled as the \u201cSupercar Collection\u201d, the Obiang cars do not have a minimum reserve price and have drawn interest from collectors in Europe, the United States, Middle East, and Far East, he said.\n\nTeodorin is the son of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who has ruled the west African state for four decades. Rights groups have labeled his administration one the world\u2019s most corrupt.\n\nA white 2014 Lamborghini Veneno Roadster, with the initials TNO painted on the hood and \u2018gull wing\u2019 doors, is the star lot, valued at 5.2 million to 6.2 million Swiss francs. One of only nine made, it has 325 km (200 miles) on the clock, and was being inspected by a potential German bidder kneeling in the grass.\n\n\u201cIt is the first time such a car is being offered at public auction,\u201d Knight said. \u201cBuyers want a car to have had few owners, a service handbook and a low odometer reading.\u201d\n\nAll but one of the 26 cars from the Obiang collection will be subject to import tax if they remain in Switzerland, Knight said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have Swiss tax paid and are not Swiss-registered,\u201d he said.\n\nA 1956 Aston Martin Lagonda, owned by Claude Nobs, the late founder of the Montreux Jazz Festival, is also on offer.\n\nThe Rolling Stones, Petula Clark, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, David Bowie and Freddie Mercury are among performers to have ridden in the raspberry vintage vehicle, the catalogue said.\n\n($1 = 0.9910 Swiss francs)", "description": "A collection of luxury cars confiscated by Geneva authorities from a son of the president of Equatorial Guinea is estimated to fetch 18.5 million Swiss francs ($18.67 million) this weekend, Bonhams auction house said on Friday.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434613384&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q1GC", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
