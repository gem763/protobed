Photo: Connie J. Spinardi/Getty Images\n\nGoogle was founded by two Stanford graduate students, Instagram by two Stanford alumni, Snapchat by a Stanford dropout. WhatsApp, Netflix, LinkedIn, Yahoo, and Hewlett-Packard were all founded by onetime Stanford students; the earliest investors in Facebook and Amazon were Stanford graduates. Even Elizabeth Holmes, symbol of Silicon Valley self-delusion and fraud, was a student at Stanford when she dropped out to found Theranos. About the only two famous tech founders with no immediately apparent Stanford connection are Steve Jobs and Bill Gates \u2014 though is it a coincidence that each had a daughter attend the school?\n\nStanford, nestled south of Facebook and west of Google, is more than a kind of finishing school to the burgeoning independent commonwealth of tech. It\u2019s already to the 21st century what Harvard, or maybe the University of Chicago, was to the 20th: the institution that grooms an elite class for power and imbues it with the reigning ideology. And for the students destined to rule over megaplatforms and other digital fiefdoms, Stanford can be less a college than a kind of incubator or accelerator \u2014 a four-year networking opportunity for the next Systrom, Spiegel, or Thiel, as everyone who goes there knows. \u201cI don\u2019t remember there being that much emphasis on serving others or what is the broad philosophical points of a Stanford education,\u201d a political-science major from the class of 2017 told us. \u201cIt really always felt like it\u2019s that gold mine, like you\u2019re just there to find that random idea and hop on that train and have $100 million by the time you\u2019re 30.\u201d\n\nNo wonder, in that case, that Stanford has been the \u201cdream school\u201d of both parents and high-school students nearly every year for a decade, according to Princeton Review surveys, or that it boasts the lowest acceptance rate among major universities. This may seem like a recent development \u2014 and only over the past decade has the school gone all-in on an ecosystem of startup-supporting programs, turning classrooms into job fairs and students into entrepreneurs-to-be, and effectively handing the keys of the campus to venture capitalists. But it\u2019s the realization of a long-term project begun in the 1950s by then-provost Frederick Terman, who sought to expand what had been a western backwater into an academic powerhouse by creating a virtuous cycle of growth: The school would encourage students to become entrepreneurs, and those entrepreneurs, once rich, would give back to the school. Terman, known as the \u201cFather of Silicon Valley,\u201d was an originator of the entrepreneurial, metrics-obsessed attitude that became the Valley\u2019s defining ethos; at graduation ceremonies, he would take notes on the back of his program about which departments were producing the most doctorates.\n\nToday, it\u2019s hard to deny that Terman\u2019s project has been a roaring success \u2014 for Stanford, at least, if not for equal income distribution in the U.S. Between 1939, when Terman set up William Hewlett and David Packard in a Palo Alto garage, and 1998, when Sergey Brin and Larry Page dropped out of the graduate computer-science department to pursue their new search engine, Stanford\u2019s endowment increased by more than a hundredfold. But in the 20 years since Brin and Page left Stanford, the engineer-entrepreneur mind-set has shifted. Once, companies like Hewlett-Packard, Sun, Cisco, and Google brought the school\u2019s academic research to market and therefore relied to varying degrees on the institutional support of Stanford \u2014 whether through the encouragement of administrators, the use of its wired-network infrastructure, or even the relicensing of intellectual property. The most important support system today is the network of people \u2014 and cash \u2014 who now populate and surround the institution, hunting for investments.\n\nNo one has noticed this more than Stanford students themselves, many of whom, it should be said, don\u2019t like that their school has been so thoroughly penetrated by money and ambition. Of course, many more are turned on by it, as would not surprise anyone who has been following the recent \u201cVarsity Blues\u201d college-admissions scandal, which gives a clear sense of just how desperate American high achievers are to secure even the tiniest sliver of additional advantage. \u201cThere were probably one in ten or maybe one in five people at Stanford who are really interested in technology, who were doing it for reasons that I would consider pure,\u201d one former engineering student complained. \u201cI think the remainder were strictly in it to get rich and 20 years ago would have worked on Wall Street.\u201d\n\nTo Stanford\u2019s credit, some of the fiercest critics of the university\u2019s most venal tendencies have come from within, like the early Holmes antagonist Phyllis Gardner, a professor of medicine at Stanford, or the M.B.A. student Adam Allcock, who went public with his discovery that Stanford\u2019s business school was granting financial aid to students based on their perceived worth to the school, not their need. The whistle-blower whose information ultimately revealed Elizabeth Holmes\u2019s fraud was a Stanford graduate \u2014 and the grandson of Hoover Institution fellow George Shultz.\n\nIf you\u2019re cynical, though, you might want to just keep quiet. The guy sitting outside Coupa Caf\u00e9 in the fleece vest might be an engineering professor, or he might be a VC. He might even be both: At Stanford, professors don\u2019t just introduce you to potential investors; they often invest in student projects themselves. Want to impress those guys, bag yourself a big seed round, and escape into billionairedom?

A VC literally wrote a check for $10,000 on the spot. We were just like, \u2018What just happened? What even is that? Are there terms with that?\u2019 \u201d \u2014Danielle Pensack, M.B.A. \u201919 \u201cYou\u2019d see VCs hanging out outside Green Library all the time, trying to see what was going on.\u201d \u2014Mechanical-engineering major, class of \u201916\n\nN o . 3 : W h i c h m a k e s f o r a p r e t t y i n t e n s e , s t r a n g e c a m p u s . \u201cWe had a saying \u2014 the \u2018duck syndrome.\u2019 Everyone looked fine on the surface, but we were all swimming hard as ever under the water to keep ourselves both afloat and moving forward.

Shaw) \u27bd Go for computer science.\n\nAnd here\u2019s where the rubber hits the road: CS 107*\n\n\ufeffAll computer-science majors start with the same sequence of classes, the most important of which is CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems. After you get through 107 (and add it to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on Handshake), you might already start getting recruitment emails from companies who see completing 107 as \u201cthe time when [a student] can feasibly join any dev role at entry level,\u201d as one student put it.\n\n\u201cIt was very much a moment-of-truth class for me. I had to take it twice. The first time was during a quarter when I was already struggling, and it totally crushed me. The material seemed absolutely impenetrable. My second try, I treated it very seriously as an obstacle that would demand everything I had. That time, the experience was totally different; it felt like a series of doors unlocking.\u201d \u2014CS major, class of \u201918\n\n*Since so much attention has been paid to CS 107, companies looking for an edge are now starting to keep an eye out for CS 110, the next class in the sequence.\n\nIf you\u2019re emulating \u2026 Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn), Marissa Mayer (Google, Yahoo), or Mike Krieger (Instagram) \u27bd Symbolic systems is for you. (Yes, that\u2019s a real major, mixing big-picture theory and programming practice)\n\nIf you worship \u2026 Kevin Systrom (Instagram) \u27bd Try management science and engineering.\n\nIf you\u2019re more into \u2026 Bill Hewett and David Packard (HP) or Jerry Yang and David Filo (Yahoo) \u27bd They all picked electrical engineering.\n\nNo. 7: Then meet (and brownnose) the faculty.\n\nIllustration: Joe McKendry\n\nDavid Beach\n\nBeach is the longtime leader of the cutting-edge Product Realization Lab, which is basically MythBusters on steroids. In 2011, Beach told The Stanford Daily that about 40 percent of the engineering staff at Tesla were PRL alums. \u201cHis top students and his favorites got introductions or really plum jobs at Apple hardware or other design studios like Ideo,\u201d a mechanical-engineering major from the class of \u201916 said.\n\nPhoto: Joe McKendry\n\nMehran Sahami\n\nWidely known by his first name, Sahami is beloved and famous primarily as the fall-semester teacher for CS 106A, the most widely taken class in the entire university. He has also, on rare occasions, invested in student companies; maybe the one black eye on his reputation is that he invested in Clinkle, a start-up launched by a student of his that became an embodiment of the failures of start-up culture. According to one student, \u201cA vote of approval from [Mehran] means a lot to other people who wouldn\u2019t be willing to give you money or invest in you or take you seriously.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Joe McKendry\n\nDon Knuth\n\nA legend in computer science who\u2019s often called the \u201cYoda of Silicon Valley\u201d and the author of the ongoing book project The Art of Computer Programming, Knuth has won basically every accolade in the field, including the Turing Award. If you\u2019re a real CS academic nerd and think you know your stuff, Knuth gives a cash reward of $2.56 (one hexadecimal dollar) to anyone who finds a mistake in one of his books. \u201cPeople talked about getting one of those checks as if it was computer science\u2019s Nobel Prize,\u201d webcomic artist Randall Munroe said.\n\nPhoto: Joe McKendry\n\nTina Seelig\n\nSeelig wears many hats across the university. As a longtime shepherd of elite tech-management training programs like the Mayfield Fellowship, Seelig may have a bigger network in the Valley than just about anyone at Stanford.\n\nNo. 8: Maybe they\u2019ll even let you TA.\n\nTeaching assistants for CS courses make up an important network that feeds into Facebook, Google, and other big Valley companies: \u201cIt\u2019s a smallish number of people, several dozen, all of whom know each other and are quite tight-knit because they have to work really hard together,\u201d said one student. While TA-ing 106A and 106B might be slightly easier (since they\u2019re introductory courses), you\u2019ll have a better shot at landing one of the CS TA spots if you shoot for more advanced courses, where \u201cthe supply-demand ratio is much more favorable for applicants,\u201d said another. On the other hand, if you already know enough to TA for CS 221/229 (AI/Machine Learning), \u201cTesla or Waymo or someone would come knocking pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nBeing a research assistant can pay off too: \u201cSomebody I know who\u2019s starting a company worked as a research assistant. A lot of the professors at Stanford are angel investors in start-ups, so they will give checks to student companies pretty regularly and will advise you on those companies. Someone I know was at a research lab of one professor, and that person helped refer them to all these different networks and other ecosystems of people who might be helpful.\u201d\n\nNo. 9: These classes are practically job fairs.\n\nIllustration: Joe McKendry\n\nCS 147\n\nIntroduction to Human-Computer Interaction Design\n\nProfessor James Landay throws a project fair \u201cwhere real-life people take a look at students\u2019 shitty HCI projects.\u201d One \u201csexy\u201d recent project was Munch, \u201ca unique platform offering instant, location-based dining promotions so consumers can find reasonably priced eating options and restaurants can moderate demand and control excess food supplies\u201d\u2014that is, an app where you can buy surplus food (a \u201csexy area of focus,\u201d according to one student).\n\nIllustration: Joe McKendry\n\nCS 221*\n\nArtificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques\n\n\ufeffThe final-project session \u201cis a direct means to cash out,\u201d says Jonathan Yu, class of \u201917. \u201cLiterally, like 3,000 people from industry, I think, went to the last one \u2026 One of my friends did a project using neural nets to seamlessly edit the selfie stick out of selfies.

Here\u2019s one former Stanford campus ambassador for Sequoia on how he got the job and how it worked:\n\nHow do people generally become student ambassadors for Sequoia?\n\nIt\u2019s both cold calls and referrals from current ambassadors.\n\nWhat does being an ambassador entail?\n\nI always had my ears open to meeting interesting people on campus, and then, once a year, did a campus landscape, so just reporting on what things I was involved in and if there was anything interesting going on there. One time, I helped set up an event, bringing in one of the partners from Sequoia to speak at Stanford.\n\nDid they pay you for the work?\n\nNo.\n\nYou did it for the network opportunities?\n\nBeing part of this community is super-helpful for me.\n\nNo. 12: Try to land one of these coveted internships.\n\nPalantir\n\n\u201cPalantir, for a while, was actually above the big companies here. If you did a Palantir engineering internship, you were guaranteed a job anywhere else.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Duncan.Hull/Wikicommons\n\nThe Elon Empire\n\n\u201cTesla was the only actual mechanical-engineering firm other than Apple that let you live in the Bay Area and paid a decent salary, so everyone wanted to go work there. And then you had SpaceX, and they build rockets and they\u2019re not a weird defense contractor.\u201d\n\nGoogle\n\n\u201cFor product managers, the desirable one is the Google associate-product-manager internship or the new grad program.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Greg Doherty/PMC\n\n\u2026 But Not Amazon\n\n\u201cI was specifically advised to never work for Amazon. I was told it will make your life hell, they treat everyone really poorly, it\u2019s a toxic culture.\u201d\n\nNo. 13: And don\u2019t sleep on non-tech extracurriculars.\n\n(Also \u2014 just don\u2019t sleep.)\n\nPhoto: Frank Chen\n\nBallroom Dancing\n\nSome of the best networking opportunities come from less obvious clubs. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a sufficient number of tech-oriented people in basically any Stanford organization, it can become a self-reinforcing pipeline by accident,\u201d says Jonathon Yu, class of \u201918. Take the Viennese Ball, for example. There is nothing special about a ballroom-dance group in particular that guarantees entry to tech, and yet: \u201cThe generation before me, a very large percentage of people went to work for Facebook, and this is before Facebook went public, because some previous members of the [dance] group had gone to work at Facebook, so they offered referrals \u2026 [The ball] just helps you make sure that you\u2019re not going to get ignored when you cold-apply. One group of people from the dance is this subset of five or six people who now all work on the self-driving car at Tesla, which, considering that\u2019s probably only 40 or 50 people, is a large subset of their AI team.\u201d\n\nStanford Review\n\nThe Stanford Review, co-founded in 1987 to provide a contrarian and mostly right-wing perspective, is still tied to its co-founder Peter Thiel, who regularly hires Review editors to venture-capital firms and companies he co-founded as well as nonprofits he funds. Three co-founders of Palantir \u2014 Thiel, Joe Lonsdale, and Stephen Cohen \u2014 were editors-in-chief of the Review, and overall, about 40 percent of Review editors-in-chief over the past 30 years have interned or worked at a Thiel- or Lonsdale-affiliated institution.\n\nOne way to signal your affiliation with the Review \u2014 and to get some attention from Thiel \u2014 might be to carry around a Ren\u00e9 Girard book: There\u2019s a funny (one might say mimetic) pattern of Stanford Review editors being fans of the late French philosopher, who was a Stanford professor and an inspiration to Thiel.\n\nFrom left: Eve Jobs, daughter of Steve; Jennifer Gates, daughter of Bill.
