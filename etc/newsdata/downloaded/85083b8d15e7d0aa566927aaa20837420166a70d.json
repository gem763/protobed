Pundits inveigh regularly against the injustice of this alleged mistreatment, reckoning only sporadically with the notion that racism accusations might be warranted for a political movement that\u2019s survived the last 50 years by attracting racists, or that conservatives control most of America\u2019s most powerful institutions \u2014 the White House, the U.S. Senate, the majority of governorships and state legislatures, and the most watched cable network on television, Fox News.\n\nIt\u2019s especially hard to square this perception with the reality of this week: Three stalwarts of the Trump administration or presidential campaign \u2014 Sean Spicer, Kirstjen Nielsen, and Corey Lewandowski \u2014 have all made dramatic returns to public prominence on media platforms of national renown, as if they weren\u2019t crucial abettors to the most flagrantly racist and dishonest president in recent memory \u2014 and in Nielsen\u2019s case, culpable in the deaths of multiple children. If being publicly conservative in the Trump era does indeed presage pariahood, as many have claimed, then someone must have forgotten to tell the executives at ABC, Atlantic Media, and CNN.\n\nOn Monday, Spicer, President Trump\u2019s first White House press secretary, debuted on ABC\u2019s Dancing With the Stars, where he salsa\u2019ed to the Spice Girls\u2019 \u201cSpice Up Your Life\u201d wearing a neon-green tunic. Spicer\u2019s relentless dishonesty with reporters during his seven-month White House tenure \u2014 he famously insisted that Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd was the biggest in history, that nearly one-sixth of voters in 2008 were noncitizens, and that Trump\u2019s since-imprisoned campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, played a \u201cvery limited role\u201d in his campaign \u2014 was the public\u2019s first brush with an administration that would defy precedent with the frequency of its lies. Spicer\u2019s reputation as one of the most vocal defenders of Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban, among other policies, underwent a laundering within mere months of his White House departure, when he appeared on the Emmy Awards to joke about \u2014 what else? \u2014 the fact that he tells lots of lies. None of which has deterred ABC from paying him a minimum of $125,000 to appear on its airwaves in the coming months.\n\nTuesday, meanwhile, saw the Atlantic announce an updated lineup for its upcoming festival in Washington, D.C., billed as a showcase for \u201csome of the most fascinating people in the world,\u201d including \u201c[the] biggest names in politics.\u201d Among them will be Nielsen, Trump\u2019s former secretary of Homeland Security, who before resigning in April oversaw the implementation of his migrant-family-separation policy, which systematized the removal of undocumented, mostly Central American children from their parents as a deterrent to future immigrants. These children were imprisoned indefinitely at detention camps, the conditions in which ranged from austere to filthy to lethal. One facility, in Clint, Texas, held 300 children despite having the capacity for 100 and drew nationwide outrage because its administrators were denying them toothpaste and soap. At least seven migrant children have died since being detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents under this policy. In the face of these atrocities, Nielsen, who will be interviewed onstage at the Atlantic Festival, has repeatedly lied about the Trump administration\u2019s having a policy of family separation at all.\n\nLewandowski, who served as Trump\u2019s campaign manager from early 2015 to June 2016, was called before the House Judiciary Committee the same day for questioning about whether Trump obstructed justice during the Mueller investigation. In addition to clearly relishing the opportunity to frustrate Democrats, Lewandowski is considering a U.S. Senate run in New Hampshire as a Republican, and he used the appearance to showcase his talents as a statesman. These amounted most notably to glib boasts about his personal dishonesty, as when he told his interviewers, \u201cI have no obligation to be honest with the media,\u201d in response to questions about whether he misled MSNBC reporters in February by claiming not to remember whether Trump asked him to push then\u2013Attorney General Jeff Sessions to slow the Russia inquiry. Lewandowski was booked for an appearance on CNN soon after appearing before the committee. The network had hired him as a commentator shortly after his departure from the Trump campaign in 2016, but to have him on immediately after he bragged about having no obligation to tell them the truth seemed especially ill advised \u2014 not to mention that he used the opportunity to lie yet again, as could\u2019ve been predicted.\n\nAll three appearances follow a pattern whereby media and educational institutions help former government figures transition from lives of administrative neglect, dishonesty, and violence to careers as TV fixtures or peddlers of expert insight on matters of national importance. This is not an exclusively partisan phenomenon \u2014 former Michigan governor Rick Snyder, the Republican who presided over the Flint water crisis, was offered a Harvard fellowship mere months after former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, the Democrat who helped hide information about Laquan McDonald\u2019s shooting death by police from the public, got a job as a contributor at \u2014 where else? \u2014 the Atlantic. Nor is it inherently irresponsible to question such people in a journalistic setting; on the contrary, to do so can be a vehicle for accountability. But there\u2019s limited utility in doing so with the impotence that\u2019s defined many past media efforts to do so, and with individuals whose defining feature is shameless dishonesty in the service of racist, state-sanctioned brutality. That such a range of outlets are willing to grant them a platform anyway highlights the absurdity of the notion that being Trump-supporting reprobates costs conservatives much of anything.", "description": "Corey Lewandowski\u2019s testimony before Congress, Dancing With the Stars\u2019 inclusion of Sean Spicer, and the Atlantic Festival hosting Kiertjen Nielsen demonstrate how being a Trump supporter or conservative in public is not a recipe for social ruin.", "authors": ["Zak Cheney-Rice"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/18/18-sean-spicer-dancing.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
