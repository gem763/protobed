But I am a lot less confident about the survival of the American-led liberal world order.\n\nThat is, in part, because American hegemony was already waning when Trump took office. China, not the United States, now has the world\u2019s largest navy. That\u2019s not Trump\u2019s fault, and indeed he is raising defense spending, although not enough to tilt the balance of power in Asia. Nor is it Trump\u2019s fault that most Americans became weary of foreign interventions after the disasters in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is Trump\u2019s fault is that he is pursuing an unprecedented policy of humiliating, denigrating and undermining our closest allies in ways that are likely to do irreparable harm to relationships that have taken decades to build.\n\nConsider Canada. The way Trump is treating our northern neighbor is, as a former U.S. ambassador to Ottawa said, \u201cthe definition of insanity.\u201d Canada is America\u2019s largest trade partner and the closest of security partners. Canadian troops have fought alongside Americans from World War I to the war in Afghanistan, and it is a close partner in everything from intelligence sharing (the Five Eyes Alliance) to air defense (the North American Aerospace Defense Command).\n\nYet Trump insists on treating Canada as the enemy, imposing steel and aluminum tariffs to protect U.S. \u201cnational security.\u201d In off-the-record comments to Bloomberg News, Trump insisted that any revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement would be \u201ctotally on our terms \u201d and that if Canada balked at his unreasonable demands, he would impose tariffs on Canadian-produced vehicles. That makes no sense because such tariffs would hurt American companies such as General Motors, which produces Chevrolet Impalas at a plant in Ontario. Trump is oblivious to the fact that Canada is America\u2019s largest export market and that we actually run a trade surplus with Canada.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s behind Trump\u2019s enmity against Canada, unless he simply resents the fact that its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is younger, smarter and handsomer. Trump walked out of the Group of Seven summit early in June, blasting Trudeau as \u201cvery dishonest & weak,\u201d while his trade adviser Peter Navarro said there is a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d for Trudeau. Contrast such scathing comments with Trump\u2019s obsequiousness toward dictators such as Vladimir Putin (\u201ca strong leader\u201d) or Kim Jong-un (\u201cstrong,\u201d \u201cfunny,\u201d \u201csmart\u201d).\n\nTrump\u2019s attitude toward Canada is sadly typical of the way he treats America\u2019s friends. In July, just before his surrender to Putin in Helsinki, Trump berated and belittled America\u2019s NATO allies. Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister, called his trip \u201can unmitigated disaster,\u201d and Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said, \u201cWe can no longer fully rely on the White House.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan has tried to cultivate Trump, but he has little to show for it: Trump hasn\u2019t exempted Japan from steel and aluminum tariffs, and he has ignored Abe\u2019s advice against making unilateral concessions to North Korea such as canceling military exercises. According to The Post, Trump insulted Abe by telling him, \u201cI remember Pearl Harbor\u201d (Trump was born in 1946) and berating him for a litany of largely imaginary trade offenses that hark back to the 1980s.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are in New Delhi this week cultivating a potentially important new ally, but their task is vastly complicated by Trump\u2019s disrespectful behavior toward Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The New York Times notes: \u201cA video of Mr. Trump imitating Mr. Modi has gone viral in New Delhi. So have reports that Mr. Trump often mimics his Indian counterpart in internal discussions.\u201d So Trump\u2019s juvenile antics could imperil an alliance that the United States needs to counter China.\n\nVirtually the only allies that Trump has close relationships with are Saudi Arabia and Israel \u2014 in the former case because it\u2019s not a democracy, in the latter because of his own domestic political needs. (Republicans love Israel, and Jewish conservatives such as Sheldon Adelson are big donors.) But giving a blank check to Israel in its settler policies, and to Saudi Arabia in its battles with Yemen, Qatar, domestic dissidents and even Canada, is not helpful to America\u2019s long-term interest \u2014 or even Saudi Arabia\u2019s and Israel\u2019s.\n\nFar from making the United States respected, as he often claims, Trump is turning it into a worldwide object of mockery and scorn, fear and loathing. The damage won\u2019t easily be undone even if he is replaced by a saner successor. Other nations will always know that there is a market in America for isolationism and protectionism, and that we are always one election away from putting another populist rabble-rouser in power. Why would any ally trust the United States ever again?\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Our allies are regarding us with hostility, bewilderment and contempt", "authors": ["Max Boot", "Columnist Covering National Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FFl1SdfPy4mce7wI38uCIvqC5DE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q5376XU7AAI6RE7DETIXAPJKPI.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-05"}
