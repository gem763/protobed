The PPT provides that treaty benefits may be denied where it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that a key reason for any transaction was to obtain such a benefit.\n\nThe most obvious example involves the use of tax avoidance structures or arrangements such as holding or shell companies set up \u201cprincipally\u201d to take advantage of a double taxation treaty.\n\n\u201cThe PPT may disproportionately apply to holding companies or other entities that do not have significant substance in a jurisdiction since it is likely that tax authorities may form the view that granting treaty benefits to such companies may not be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant treaty provisions,\u201d says Patrick Marley, a tax lawyer in Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP\u2019s Toronto office. \u201cAs a result, there is a greater likelihood that disputes involving such companies may need to be resolved by the court.\u201d\n\nTo date, some 89 jurisdictions who are parties to more than 1,400 double taxation treaties have signed the MLI, and 26 \u2014 including Canada \u2014 have formally ratified them.\n\nFive of Canada\u2019s most important trade partners in 2018 \u2014 China, the United Kingdom, Japan, Mexico, and South Korea \u2014 have signed the treaty although only the U.K. and Japan are the only ones to have ratified so far.\n\nCanada has advised the OECD that it is amenable to having 84 of its 93 double taxation treaties subject to the MLI when and if the various countries involved also ratify them and designate them as CTAs.\n\nNotable exceptions are the United States, Germany and Switzerland, with whom Canada has double taxation treaties but who have not signed the MLI. However, Canada has engaged these countries in bilateral treaty negotiations that are expected to mirror the convention\u2019s provisions.\n\nEcuador, Guyana, Kyrgyzstan, Taiwan, Uzbekistan and Venezuela are the other countries who have treaties with Canada but are not MLI signatories.\n\nThe MLI will, as of January 1, affect withholding taxes under Canada\u2019s tax treaties with countries that have ratified the MLI. It will impact other taxes, including capital gains taxes, for the tax year beginning on or after June 1, 2020. Additional treaties will be affected as Canada\u2019s partners ratify the MLI.\n\nWhat is certain is that the impact on withholding taxes could be significant.\n\n\u201cIf the treaty benefits don\u2019t apply because of the PPT test, the withholding tax in the case of dividends could rise from as little as five per cent to 25 per cent,\u201d Hueppelsheuser says. \u201cSo in some cases it may be better for investors to structure their investments to produce an interest stream rather than a dividend stream.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawyer, foreign investors with inherent gains who may be caught by the MLI should at least look into selling their interests before the convention takes effect.\n\n\u201cWhile the MLI is not retroactive, it does capture the entirety of the gain on the date of disposition,\u201d Hueppelsheuser says.\n\nBut the biggest issue may be the uncertainty created by the PPT.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not at all clear how Canadian courts will deal with PPT and its effect on our GAAR (general anti-avoidance rule), which our courts have interpreted for decades and whose approach we understand,\u201d says Marley. \u201cThere\u2019s also some concern about how Canadian courts will deal with foreign decisions interpreting the MLI, because the identical rule will be found in many treaties.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s apparent is that the MLI is already in the Canada Revenue Agency\u2019s (CRA) crosshairs.\n\n\u201cWhen Canadian businesses receive tax advice, (they) should take the potential application of the MLI into consideration,\u201d the CRA stated in an email responding to questions from the Financial Post.\n\nWith regard to the interplay of GAAR and PPT, the CRA points out that Canadian GAAR applies to \u201cany benefit\u201d provided under a tax treaty.\n\n\u201cIn appropriate circumstances, the principal purpose test in the MLI and the Canadian GAAR could apply as alternative assessing positions to a given transaction or arrangement,\u201d the Agency states. \u201cThe CRA has not yet had to consider the application of the principal purpose test in the MLI in conjunction with the Canadian GAAR. Such a determination will depend on the specifics of the case.\u201d\n\nMarley believes that\u2019s not the right approach.\n\n\u201cThe PPT rule as drafted is not too different from the Canadian rule, so we hope that they will be interpreted by the courts in a consistent manner,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if the two are consistent, there is no reason for the courts to apply both at the same time\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Hueppelsheuser suggests that taxpayers relying on a Canadian bilateral tax treaty should consider which treaties they rely upon; which provisions of the MLI are applicable; the extent of the new withholding obligations; whether proactive steps such as restructuring or reorganization can improve tax efficiency after the MLI\u2019s effective date; and monitor the status of CTAs \u201cas these will continue to change and may have future impact.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post", "description": "The new law has set its sights on holding or shell companies set up principally to take advantage of a double taxation treaty", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/cra.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
