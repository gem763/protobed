HKEX countered with a charm offensive, bringing in UBS Group AG and HSBC Holdings Plc to try to persuade shareholders of the merits of its proposal, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\u201cThe whole offer was a farce,\u201d Christopher Cheung, a Hong Kong lawmaker and HKEX shareholder, said in phone interview. \u201cWhen HKEX announced the offer, I thought they\u2019ve already had discussions with London Stock Exchange and their regulators. It turns out they have not. HKEX now must address the danger of stagnant business growth.\u201d\n\nHKEX rose 1.6% to HK$229.60 as of 9:31 a.m. The benchmark Hang Seng Index declined 0.2%.\n\nLSE investors are due to vote on the exchange\u2019s own $27 billion deal for data provider Refinitiv before the end of the year. Any further pursuit by HKEX would depend on LSE abandoning that plan. Under U.K. takeover rules, HKEX has until Oct. 9 to make a formal offer or walk away for at least six months.\n\nBefore Tuesday\u2019s about-face, Asia\u2019s largest exchange by revenue had been attempting to regain momentum after last month\u2019s stinging rebuke from LSE\u2019s board. HKEX executives met LSE shareholders in London and New York to try to gain their backing for the takeover plan. The bourse also was in talks to borrow as much as 8 billion pounds to fund the purchase.\n\nShareholders, though, expressed support for the LSE board\u2019s preferred strategy of buying Refinitiv.\n\nAt a London conference last month, HKEX Chief Executive Officer Charles Li envisioned London at the center of trading between East and West with the help of Hong Kong. His LSE counterpart, David Schwimmer, said he preferred direct access to China and didn\u2019t need the former British colony as a conduit.\n\n\u201cThe complicated regulatory, technical and technological landscape in which we operate means we are resolutely focused on our ambitions, whilst also maintaining flexibility in our approach,\u201d Li said in a blog post Tuesday. \u201cWe are honest with ourselves too -- as we know some things we try will not develop at the speed which we would like, or in some cases, at all. Our goal is to keep moving forward, reinforcing HKEX\u2019s role and building Hong Kong\u2019s strength as a financial market.\u201d\n\n(Updates with share price in fifth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Jun Luo in Shanghai at jluo6@bloomberg.net;Kiuyan Wong in Hong Kong at kwong739@bloomberg.net;Viren Vaghela in London at vvaghela1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Candice Zachariahs at czachariahs2@bloomberg.net, ;Fion Li at fli59@bloomberg.net, Daniel Taub, Jun Luo\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. said it won\u2019t proceed with its 29.6 billion-pound ($36.4 billion) unsolicited takeover bid for London Stock Exchange Group Plc.While the HKEX\u2019s board continues to see a combination as \u201cstrategically compelling,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cdisappointed that it has been unable", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KBLNVWVl3.0h_6_KDl5e5g--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/37ef778f105d9b683c7fc62abde417af", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
