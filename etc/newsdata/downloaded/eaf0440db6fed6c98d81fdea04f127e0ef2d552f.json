It previously received smaller investments from Canada's Cannabis Growth Opportunity Corporation and Arcadian Fund of California.\n\nRead more: Cannabis startup founders share 4 critical lessons they learned while raising money in the unique industry\n\nLegal US cannabis sales hit approximately $10 billion in 2018, and the estimated total demand is greater than $50 billion. Tokr does not directly sell cannabis or CBD products but provides a space for third-party vendors.\n\nTokr's co-founders told Business Insider that the topic raised most often by cannabis investors isn't their products or backgrounds but their marketing strategy. The 3-year-old startup seeks to introduce CBD and THC to people outside the heavy marijuana user demographic. But that's hard with Facebook and Google's ban on cannabis, CBD, and ingestible hemp product ads.\n\n\"The most common question we get is, 'How do you plan to speak to consumers in a real way?'\" said Tokr chief operating officer David Mukpo.\n\nTokr claims to market its partners' products by using behavioral data to personalize the shopping experience\n\nTokr's founders said it gets around these regulations through sponsored events, partnerships with existing brands, targeted display ads and emails, and its core product, an app and website that aims to provide a tailored experience to people new to cannabis.\n\nAnother complicating factor, according to Mukpo, is that most Amazon customers already know what they want to buy when they visit the site, while many cannabis consumers need a significant amount of education and guidance before making purchases.\n\nTo that end, Chief Creative Officer Brian Campbell, a former Apple Music creative director, said he drew on Apple's ethos to simplify the shopping experience by sorting products into lifestyle categories like \"Active Lifestyle\" and \"Sex & Sexuality\" and targets users based on interest.\n\nTo avoid the struggles of publicly traded cannabis companies like Canopy Growth and MedMen, startups need to be well-capitalized\n\nMukpo said the company plans to move into series A fundraising next year, adding that Tokr looks to avoid the financial struggles of big, buzzy cannabis companies like MedMen, which recently parted with its chief marketing officer amid a stock slide, and Canopy Growth. Last week, beer giant Constellation Brands posted a loss of nearly $500 million on its investment in Canopy Growth.\n\nNoting that most of the top publicly-traded cannabis companies have less than a year's worth of cash on hand, Mukpo said the key to success in this industry is to be well-capitalized, even at the expense of some shareholder equity.\n\nMukpo said he didn't think there would be an \"Amazon of weed\" anytime soon because the industry is still too fragmented and hyper-localized because of laws that differ widely by state. Mukpo predicted the industry could consolidate, but only after US legal policy becomes more uniform. The market must also evolve beyond its current state in which most distributors claim to offer their own unique brand of products, he said.", "description": "The founders of Tokr said investors often ask how the startup will market itself to users, given restrictions on advertising.", "authors": ["Patrick Coffee"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9bb5444b65073eee3c3acb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
