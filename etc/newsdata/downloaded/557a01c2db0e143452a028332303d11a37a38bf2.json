Caulkins, Beau Kilmer\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released drug overdose statistics for 2018, and they are shocking. Of the estimated 47,000 deaths from opioids last year, roughly two-thirds involved potent synthetic opioids, most of them fentanyl.\n\nFor most victims, fentanyl was not their drug of choice. Rather, they were poisoned by dealers who mixed it into baggies of heroin or pressed into fake-opioid tablets. Share on Twitter\n\nAmerica's fentanyl problem is far deadlier than past crises with other illegal drugs. It also has a fundamentally different character. For most victims, fentanyl was not their drug of choice. Rather, they were poisoned by dealers who mixed it into baggies of heroin or pressed into fake-opioid tablets.\n\nWhat is happening with fentanyl is unlike the trajectory of previous drug epidemics. Those typically involved \u201ccontagious\u201d spread of initial use\u2014primarily among those who may have been ignorant of the drug's risks. This was the case with prescription opioids, which were prescribed aggressively for chronic pain. Some individuals who sought pain treatment now have an opioid use disorder. So do others who got the pills from neighbors or friends for recreational use.\n\nIn the case of fentanyl, it is largely the suppliers\u2014not users\u2014who have embraced the drug because it is an ideal cost-cutting substitute. Synthetic opioids are produced in labs, so they are much cheaper than heroin\u2014perhaps as much as 99% cheaper per dose after adjusting for potency. It's also easy to acquire. Anyone with an internet connection can purchase synthetic opioids that are most frequently made in China and delivered through the mail or by parcel service. Some Mexican crime syndicates trafficking heroin are also adding fentanyl to their portfolios.\n\nDealers add fentanyl, which is up to 100 times more potent than morphine, to heroin and counterfeit tablets made to look like genuine prescription medications. Adding a few milligrams gives a powerful kick; a few more turn deadly.\n\nMost of the people exposed to\u2014and dying from\u2014fentanyl didn't think they were buying it and didn't want to use it. Share on Twitter\n\nIn short, most of the people exposed to\u2014and dying from\u2014fentanyl didn't think they were buying it and didn't want to use it. Rather than increasing the number of users, fentanyl is driving up the death rate.\n\nThis distinction is important: It means our traditional methods for responding to drug epidemics won't reverse the death toll. Usually government agencies focus on preventing experimentation, reducing accessibility of drugs, and treating individuals to suppress demand. These efforts remain valuable, but they won't immediately curb overdose deaths in places that are drowning in fentanyl.\n\nIt is better to conceptualize the fentanyl problem like a poisoning outbreak. The poison is out there\u2014but how can exposure to it be minimized? How can its spread to other regions be contained?\n\nEfforts to disrupt online purchases, for instance, might look very different than traditional drug interdiction efforts. It could include hacking or seizing websites that sell the drugs. Law enforcement might set up fake websites that offer fentanyl but never deliver it. The failure of some sites to fulfill orders might lead to distrust of web-based sales generally.\n\nEliminating the supply entirely seems impossible. But delaying fentanyl's expansion in the western United States by even a few years could save thousands of lives. Today, fentanyl deaths are concentrated in Appalachia, New England and parts of the Midwest. In 2017, if the rest of the country had had a per capita rate of synthetic opioid-related deaths that was just half of New England's, some 9,000 more Americans would have died from synthetic opioids that year.\n\nPolicymakers should be expanding access to naloxone, the overdose reversal medication, but must also look beyond that. Some innovative approaches used in other countries include supervising consumption of illegal drugs so overdoses don't become fatal and providing heroin-assisted treatment for those who have not benefited from other therapies.\n\nYet, these still may not be enough. Vancouver, Canada, has embraced harm reduction interventions and still has a synthetic opioid-involved overdose death rate comparable to some of the hardest-hit places in the United States. This does not mean such interventions haven't saved lives. But it does suggest that it will take more than this to solve this problem.\n\nNew ideas\u2014be they public policies, technologies or law enforcement strategies\u2014are desperately needed. Continuing to treat fentanyl just like previous drug epidemics will likely be insufficient and may condemn thousands more to early deaths.\n\nBryce Pardo is associate policy researcher at the nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation.
