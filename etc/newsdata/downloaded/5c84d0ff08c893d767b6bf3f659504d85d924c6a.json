She was told she could be jailed for the rest of her life.\n\nJudge Jeremy Richardson QC told the pair they will be sentenced on November 12 and said: \"No words of mine can ever fully reflect the enormity of what you have both done.\n\n\"The crimes you have committed quite frankly speak for themselves. The murder of two children.\n\n\"The attempted murder of four children and the over-arching conspiracy to murder those children.\n\n\"I repeat, those crimes speak for themselves.\n\n\"I have little doubt that each of you will in due course be sentenced to several terms of life imprisonment.\n\n\"This may well be a case, but it's a matter for the judge, where a whole life order is imposed.\"\n\nNo details were given in court about what happened to the children inside the house in Sheffield.\n\nA serious case review is to be held into the deaths of the two boys.\n\nIn May, Councillor Jackie Drayton, Sheffield City Council's cabinet member for children and families, said she was \"devastated\" to hear of the deaths.\n\nShe said the review would be formally commissioned by the Safeguarding Children Board.\n\n\"All partners in the city will be coming together to understand, review and reflect on exactly what happened and why,\" she said.\n\nThe review's findings will be made public once it has concluded, she added.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHundreds of mourners attended the funeral of the two teen brothers who were laid to rest together in one coffin last month.\n\nBlake and Tristen's shared coffin arrived to Grenoside Crematorium in Sheffield with an enormous cortege of 300 motorcycles and two Lamborghini cars.\n\nFriends and family say the brothers were both fanatical about fast cars and motorbikes, so local owners were asked to be part of the procession.\n\nAs the white coffin, which had the boys' names engraved on it, entered the crematorium the Ed Sheeran song Thinking Out Loud was played on loudspeakers.\n\nIt was revealed in May that Tristen appeared on a BBC programme with a yellow mohawk to raise money for a friend battling cancer.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nTristen spoke about his hairstyle in the TV show called Our School in 2017 and his efforts to support his school friend.\n\nTristen said his pal was \"dying of bone cancer\" so he decided to dye his hair yellow - his friend's favourite colour - as BBC cameras captured him laughing and joking with fellow pupils at his school.\n\nIn the BBC programme, Tristen says: \"My friend is dying of bone cancer, I asked if I could dye my hair yellow for him.\n\n\"His favourite colour is yellow.\"\n\nTristan said his hair \"makes me who I want to be\".\n\nHe added: \"With normal hair, you look like any other person.\"\n\nThe TV series showed pupils as they prepared to go from Year 6 to Year 7.", "description": "Sarah Barrass sobbed in court last month when she, along with family member Brandon Machin, pleaded guilty to murdering Tristen and Blake", "authors": ["Andy Rudd", "Rosaleen Fenton", "Image", "Facebook", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20537366.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_sarr1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
