The 2006 home, like many on the island, was built using horse-drawn drays and snowmobiles. The cost was about $490,000.\n\nA big draw of Mackinac Island in Northern Michigan is the feeling of living in a simpler, less hurried time. A ban on motor vehicles most of the year makes the green oasis set in the blue waters of Lake Huron uncommonly peaceful.\n\nIt also can make even the simplest household task uncommonly difficult. Imagine ordering a new refrigerator and having it arrive by horse and cart. Now imagine building a vacation home with similar restrictions.\n\n\u201cYou have to be humble and patient,\u201d says Karen Hagelstein.\n\nJennifer and Dan Wohletz with their daughter, Natalia, on the front porch of their 2,100-square foot home.

Two years later, their 2,600-square-foot pink Victorian still has about 12 months to go\u2014and Ms. Hagelstein says it could stretch into 2021. The cost, about $350 a square foot, also reflects the complicated building logistics.\n\nMackinac (pronounced Mack-i-naw) Island is 3.8 square miles. It was once a fur-trading post that became a vacation spot in the late 1800s. The town banned cars, or \u201chorseless carriages,\u201d in 1898, followed in 1901 by a law prohibiting them on state park land, which makes up 80% of the island. There are no exhaust fumes or beeping garbage trucks. Electric bikes are allowed only with proof of a disability, carried at all times, and golf carts can\u2019t leave the golf course.\n\n\u201c \u201cYou have to be humble and patient.\u201d \u201d \u2014Karen Hagelstein\n\nMany of the large Victorian homes, called cottages by locals, date to the 19th century. No more than two new homes get built on the island a year, city officials estimate. As a result, empty lots are widely available and go for about $70,000 for a quarter acre. At the same time, it is hard to find an existing house for under $1 million. The year-round population has been fairly steady for the past four decades, at about 500.\n\nThe Hagelsteins hired an architect for their new home, but had to alter their plans when the building commission deemed the footprint too big. By the time the blueprints were approved (meetings are only once a month), it was almost winter, when snow and ice preclude much building. Yet motor vehicles, which have to be approved, permitted and accompanied by a police escort, are allowed on the island only between October and May, and are granted only to the companies doing the work.\n\nThe three-bedroom Wohletz home. Houses on the island have to go through a design review and tend to have a traditional aesthetic.

Because there is only one excavation company on the island, they had to get all the supplies to the site and ready to go for when the excavators found an opening in their schedule.\n\n\u201cEvery step in the real world is 10 more steps here. You have to really think it through,\u201d says Adrienne Rilenge, who handles the front office for U.P. North Construction & Restoration, a Mackinac Island company started by her parents, who built their own house on the island in 2000.\n\nListings $5.85 million\n\nAlgonquin Street\n\nSeven bedrooms, six bathrooms This West Bluff cottage was built in 1888 and has been completely restored.

It comes with a horse stable under an apartment.\n\nAgent: Mackinac Island Realty\n\nLumber for homes comes from the mainland, some 8 miles away, by ferry. When the lake freezes in winter, materials are dragged by snowmobiles across the ice, guided by the discarded Christmas trees residents donate for beacons.\n\nCement trucks aren\u2019t allowed, so all concrete is mixed by hand on site or brought over already formed in blocks. The Hagelsteins\u2019 project called for 80,000 pounds of concrete, which was needed after the hole was dug but which would be too heavy to transport by snowmobile over ice. It went by ferry last fall and was stored in rented space at the dock.\n\nMs. Hagelstein wasn\u2019t worried anyone would take the materials. \u201cWhere would they go?\u201d she laughs.\n\nSupplies get picked up on the docks by wagons, or drays, drawn by two draft horses apiece, with one driver and an assistant, and taken to the building sites. Trash is hauled off the same way. Transport fees include the time the horses spend waiting while everything is unloaded. Horses and snowmobiles can only carry so much, so the process usually involves multiple trips, which costs more money and time. If a worker forgets a hammer, getting one means riding a bike into town.\n\nSubcontractors from off island get paid as soon as they get on the ferry, and the clock keeps clicking until after the ferry lands on the mainland at the end of the day. Limited ferry schedules mean they work limited hours.\n\nWhen John Strayer\u2019s family built a four-bedroom, two-bathroom home in 2000, he and his sister had to figure out how to get the home\u2019s foundation walls (each section was 10 feet wide and very heavy) from the factory on the mainland to the island. They loaded up the largest rental truck they could find with the lumber and drove the truck four hours to St. Ignace\u2014on a shore opposite the island\u2014where they put it on a barge. Upon arrival on the island, it took three drays and several hours to get all the materials from the rental truck to their site.\n\nBuilding the Old-Fashioned Way Fans of the 19th-century lifestyle of Mackinac Island face the challenging task of horse-and-dray construction Mackinac Island in Northern Michigan is a 3.8-square-mile green oasis, set in Lake Huron, known for its old-timey lifestyle. The 19th-century feel creates a challenge for home-builders.

The 19th-century feel creates a challenge for home-builders. Brian Kelly for The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cThe horses just walk. They don\u2019t gallop,\u201d says Mr. Strayer.\n\nSome islanders have found a way around the 19th-century hassle. The first house Norman and Michelle Schultz put up on Mackinac Island they did the old-fashioned way: stick-built, with materials and goods transported by horse and carts. The second time, they had the entire house transported over the water and lifted to the waterfront site by crane.\n\nThat first home, built in 2012, cost about $300 a square foot, or roughly $1.14 million. It was a 3,800-square-foot Victorian that took about two years to construct. But when another house went up blocking the view, the Schultzes sold their house for $1.9 million and bought a lot in front of it near the water for $580,000.\n\nDr. Norman Schultz decided the second home would be a 2,800-square-foot prefab house that could be transported to the property by barge. This past June, the house arrived\u2014in six pieces. Having it lifted by crane allowed them to skip the permits and police escorts, and get the work done in the summer.\n\nThe cost of the second home was roughly equal to the first, larger, one. But the saving elsewhere was dramatic: three months rather than 24.\n\nMichelle and Norman Schultz inside the 2,800-square-foot prefab home they just built on the waterfront, avoiding local building limitations.

Three others stalled because of costs, which run about 1\u00bd to 2\u00bd times as much as on the mainland. That always surprises clients, he says, even when he warns them ahead of time.\n\nThe unusual logistics of building on the island also have an impact on designs: Because hauling big steel beams by horse and cart on narrow gravel roads designed for bicycles is pretty much impossible, he doesn\u2019t include open-floor plans.\n\nThe unique lifestyle and stable population make for a strong sense of community, says Jennifer Wohletz, who owns an art and frame business in Milford. She and her husband, Dan Wohletz, built a 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom house on Mackinac in 2006 for roughly $490,000 using horse-drawn drays and snowmobiles. They raised their two children in the home\u2014which she now estimates is valued at about $575,000\u2014in the summer months, alongside friends from around the country.\n\nNorman Schultz had his new house transported in six pieces over the water on a barge to Mackinac Island and lifted to his waterfront site by crane. VIDEO: Brian Kelly for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMs. Wohletz packs for her annual four-month stay on the island in plastic bins, which work well for going on horse carts because they are water and mud proof. She leaves her car at a lot near the ferry dock in St. Ignace, and buys a $150 resident\u2019s season ferry pass. Her family and guests go everywhere by bike, because waiting for horse and carriage taxis takes too long. The summer she had surgery, her husband had to pull her around in a cart behind his bike.\n\nWhen her house needs repairs, Ms. Wohletz does her best to hire only workers regularly on the island, because others tend not to understand the logistics.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What do you think about banning cars in your town? Do you think it would be successful? Let us know below.\n\nFrancesco Viola, who owns the Luca Mariano bourbon brand and lives in Northville, Mich., is preparing to build a 4,500-square-foot vacation house on Mackinac Island. He spent more than six months finalizing plans.\n\n\u201cI did not want a dollhouse,\u201d he says of the home\u2019s aesthetic.\n\nHe is excited to start building the house, which he estimates will cost about $2.5 million. But he is apprehensive about the process and the time it will take.\n\n\u201cI am already 42 years old,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to enjoy it when I am still young.\u201d\n\nWrite to Nancy Keates at nancy.keates@wsj.com", "description": "The island off Michigan\u2019s northern coast has a ban on vehicles that gives peace of mind to the tight community but endless headaches for new-home builders.", "authors": ["Nancy Keates", "Nancy.Keates Wsj.Com", "Karen Hagelstein"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EX669_0912ho_SOC_20190909131503.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
