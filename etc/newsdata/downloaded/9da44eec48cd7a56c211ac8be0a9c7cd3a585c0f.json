The S&P 500 edged down 0.1%, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5%.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee released a whistleblower complaint Thursday that alleges President Trump sought to use the powers of his office to coerce Ukraine to investigate a political rival.\n\nTraders watched an hours-long Congressional hearing featuring the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire.\n\n\"We're just living and reacting to every headline,\" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets, who was sitting in London but watching the hearing in Washington live, and also following the political turmoil in his own country. \"It's a circus,\" he said, \"a 21st century version of a circus.\"\n\nThe controversy has become a political danger to Mr. Trump's presidency and has rallied House Democrats to seek impeachment proceedings.\n\nWhile the odds of the president actually being removed from office appear remote, the magnitude of the fight has forced market players to pay attention. The U.K. political battle over Brexit likewise has traders fixated.\n\nAfter the hearing ended, however, stocks edged off their morning lows. While traders pay attention to headlines, the Ukraine story hasn't derailed the main trends in the equities market, said Frank Cappelleri, executive director of Instinet.\n\nRight now, he said, the momentum is still with value stocks like utilities companies, real estate, and consumer staples. \"You have to respect that until it changes,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, those sectors were among the leaders Thursday.\n\nConagra Brands gained 5.3% after the company topped profit estimates for the latest quarter and reaffirmed its outlook, offsetting a sales miss.\n\nAmong utilities, Edison International, NiSource, and CMS Energy all gained more than 1%.\n\nCarnival stood out among the losers. Shares fell 8% after the cruise-ship company cut its outlook for the year, citing disruptions from Hurricane Dorian and tensions in the Arab Gulf. Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings both dropped more than 2%.\n\nTech stocks, for so long the momentum-crowd darlings, fell. Facebook dropped 1.9%. Apple fell 0.4%. Alphabet lost about 0.4%.\n\nPeloton Interactive shares debuted on the public markets with a thud. The stock fell 14% to $25.22 after the company's shares priced Wednesday night at $29, the top of the projected range.\n\nThe weak open is another dent in the IPO market, after the high-profile postponement of WeWork parent company's offering.\n\nInvestors and traders also continued to monitor the state of trade talks between the U.S. and China.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said Thursday that Chinese companies had agreed to buy \"sizable amounts\" of soybeans and pork from the U.S. ahead of high-level talks scheduled for next month. President Trump also voiced optimism about a deal.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department said Thursday that gross domestic product -- a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the U.S. -- was unrevised in the second quarter, although a key measure of corporate profits was revised lower. U.S. jobless claims increased slightly last week, according to the Labor Department.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys slipped to 1.685% from 1.732% Wednesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. In commodity markets, U.S. crude fell 0.1%. Gold prices added 0.1%.\n\nOverseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.6%, the German DAX gained 0.4% and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 gained 0.8%.\n\nIn Asia, the Nikkei climbed 0.1% after the U.S. and Japan signed a trade-enhancement agreement, which will lower agricultural tariffs in Japan, industrial tariffs in the U.S. and set new rules for digital trade.\n\nWrite to Paul Vigna at paul.vigna@wsj.com and Max Bernhard at Max.Bernhard@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 26, 2019 15:59 ET (19:59 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
