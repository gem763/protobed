Authorities are on the lookout for additional victims from the years of Hayes\u2019s life they are still trying to account for.\n\nSo far, Hayes has only been charged with the 2016 death of Rachel Bey, a 32-year-old who law enforcement officials say was discovered by a road crew at the side of a highway. But officials say they have \u201cstrong indication\u201d that Hayes was involved in the three older killings, which sowed fear among prostitutes in Daytona Beach over the span of a few months in late 2005 and early 2006, according to media reports.\n\nThe Washington Post was unable to reach Hayes or the Palm Beach County public defender\u2019s office, which is representing him, Monday evening. He is being held without bond, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe suspected serial killer was stopped thanks in large part to \u201cgenetic genealogy,\u201d officials said Monday. The new strategy has solved dozens of cold cases across the country in recent months, including the mystery of the infamous \u201cGolden State Killer,\u201d by matching crime scene DNA to relatives in sprawling online databases more commonly used by people looking to DNA kits to fill in their family tree.\n\nThe most disturbing parts of the 171-page warrant for the Golden State Killer suspect\n\n\u201cWithout genetic genealogy, predators like Mr. Hayes will continue to live in our neighborhoods, visit our parks, our libraries, restaurants and go to our nightlife entertainment districts to continue to hunt for victims,\u201d said Troy Walker, a special agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\n\nDetectives came close to Hayes after the 2005 and 2006 deaths, the Associated Press reported, questioning him because he had bought a gun similar to one that killed 24-year-old Julie Green, 35-year-old Iwana Patton and 45-year-old Laquetta Gunther. But no case against him proceeded.\n\nHayes was then a student at Bethune-Cookman University, the school told the AP on Monday. He would graduate with a degree in criminal justice.\n\nThe trail went cold until a new death \u2014 and new investigative techniques.\n\nBey was found dead the morning of March 7, 2016, Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Michael Wallace said. Results from a sexual battery kit yielded a male DNA profile that investigators ultimately connected to Hayes.\n\nA national database also linked the suspect in Bey\u2019s case to the Daytona Beach cases, authorities said. And a cigarette butt investigators collected from Hayes while tracking him helped confirm their suspicions, according to the AP.\n\nGenetic material collected in the wake of Bey\u2019s death is more likely to belong to Hayes than \u201cany other human on the planet,\u201d Wallace said Monday. \u201cWe have our guy.\u201d\n\nBey\u2019s brothers thanked law enforcement earlier in the day for \u201cnot giving up,\u201d Bradshaw, the sheriff, said.\n\nAliahu Bey told Palm Beach Post shortly after Rachel Bey\u2019s death that his younger sister was a \u201cloving and caring girl\u201d who struggled with substance abuse and got arrested on drug and prostitution charges. The trouble began when she was a teen, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a typical story: a kid hanging out with the wrong group of people,\u201d he told the Palm Beach Post.\n\nIn his last conversation with Rachel, he said, his sister asked when she would get to meet his children. A family trip was in the works.\n\nShe \u201csaid life was hard, but that she was trying,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nPolice say a woman cut off her husband\u2019s penis.
