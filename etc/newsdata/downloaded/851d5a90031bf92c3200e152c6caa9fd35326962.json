Don\u2019t forget: You'll be on camera for every plenary and committee session. For the most part, bare arms just look unprofessional.\n\n2) Ditch the high heels. Parliament has hundreds of kilometers of winding corridors, endless walkways and plenty of hidden backstairs. Half an MEP's life is spent voting; the other half, walking.\n\n3) Avoid the usher look. Ushers usually wear tailcoats and gold chains as part of their uniform. Don\u2019t go for the same look unless you want a job guarding the hemicycle, handing out documents and calling out, \u201cIL PRESIDENTE!\u201d when the Parliament chief enters the plenary.\n\n4) Don\u2019t forget your swimsuit. Strasbourg has one of the best pools in Europe. A little backstroke is also a great way to relieve any post-traumatic stress after a big vote.\n\n5) Find your own style. You're one MEP among 751, from one country out of 28, and part of a delegation of maybe a dozen others. Here's your chance to stand out. You've earned the right to show off your best Dirndl if you\u2019re Austrian, your most expensive Chanel suit if you\u2019re French, your most folkloric Krakowian costume if you\u2019re from Poland. The EU is about celebrating our cultural differences, after all.\n\n6) Be unpredictable. Just because you're a member of a conservative party doesn't mean you have to be clean shaven, wear an expensive navy-blue suit or have your hair perfectly styled. Being a scruffy, punk member of the European People\u2019s Party is fine too \u2014 it might even encourage a few more people to learn your name.", "description": "How to stand out \u2014 or blend into the background \u2014 as an MEP.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/whattowearfeatured-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-08"}
