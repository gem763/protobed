In a statement to Newsday, attorney Ed Sapone said Flach \u201cstrongly maintains his innocence\u201d and \u201ctook the responsible step of self-surrendering to eventually clear his name\u201d. Mr Sapone says that at \u201cappropriate time,\u201d the defence will release \u201cvital information\u201d not captured on video of the attack. He also asked the Oceanside community to \u201creserve judgment\u201d until additional information is released.\n\nIn a video posted to YouTube on Wednesday, Oceanside Superintendent of Schools Phyllis Harrington urged students and parents to \u201cuse restraint and judgment\u201d on social media and encouraged parents to monitor their children\u2019s social media usage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to the safety and security of our school that we do not engage in spreading rumours,\u201d Harrington said.\n\nMore than 300 people attended a memorial for Morris on Wednesday night, the second of a two-night vigil at the site of the attack, and called for justice.\n\nPolice will be assigned to patrol Oceanside High School and neighbouring schools, according to a statement from Nassau County Executive Laura Curran. County authorities also are offering mental health services to support students.\n\n\u201cI want to plead with all our residents -- not just our young people: If you see someone in serious danger, please use your phone to get help - not likes and shares,\u201d Ms Curran said. \u201cOur law enforcement and first responders are trained to save lives in dangerous situations, and someone\u2019s life can depend on a matter of seconds.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a person that would help anyone, and no one helped him,\u201d Keyanna Morris, Khaseen\u2019s sister, told an ABC news affiliate earlier this week. \u201cHe told my mom this is the first time in so long that he\u2019s been so happy because he finally found a school where he could be himself with nobody judging him.\u201d", "description": "A 16-year-old boy was stabbed to death while dozens of teenagers watched or used their phones to film an after-school assault.
