There are various options, but not all are good.\n\nVote of no confidence flaw\n\nThe SNP had been pushing the idea of vote of no confidence in the prime minister. The rest of the \u201crebel alliance\u201d, though, has rejected this for now, because they can\u2019t yet agree on who should replace him.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Johnson might refuse to quit even if he lost the vote. There is no law requiring a prime minister who loses a vote of no confidence to\n\nresign. There is merely a convention that they should \u2013 and that only applies if it is clear that there\u2019s somebody else who can command the confidence of the House of Commons.

The prime minister would obey convention and quit. But is anybody really sure that Johnson, who has already tried unlawfully to suspend parliament, would play by the rules?\n\nThe Fixed Term Parliaments Act says that, if there\u2019s a vote of no confidence in a prime minister, there has to be an early election. This can only be avoided if there is a vote of confidence in \u201cHer Majesty\u2019s government\u201d within 14 days. (See section 2.5).\n\nIf Johnson refused to quit, he would still be running Her Majesty\u2019s government and there would be no way to stop an election. By the time it had been held, we would have crashed out of the EU with no deal \u2013 the precise outcome that the opposition wants to avoid.\n\nQueen damned if she fired him, damned if she didn\u2019t\n\nOne way of preventing such a disastrous chain of events would be for the Queen to use her reserve power to remove prime ministers. (See Cabinet Manual, section 2.9). She would have every justification to do so \u2013 and arguably a duty to do so. But it would be a massively controversial decision that might shake the monarchy to its foundations.\n\nThe last time a monarch fired a prime minister was when William IV removed Lord Melbourne, the Whig, in 1834 because the government was too radical for his taste. He installed Robert Peel, the Conservative, instead. But Peel failed to win an election a few months later and William IV ended up reappointing Melbourne.\n\nIt\u2019s so easy to see a rerun of this scenario. The Queen fires Johnson. An unstable government collapses soon after. Johnson, whose Tories are already comfortably ahead of Labour in the opinion polls, then wins an election and storms back into Downing Street.\n\nCan we rely on a 93-year-old monarch facing down a brazen prime minister who is willing to break the rules? Even if she did, our constitutional crisis would become vastly more toxic. It would be better for her not to be put in such an intolerable position in the first place.\n\nHumble address\n\nA partial solution to this problem would be to remove Johnson as prime minister without triggering a vote of no confidence. Helen Mountfield QC wrote in a legal opinion last week that MPs could indicate who they want to take over by passing a humble address. The Queen wouldn\u2019t therefore have to take a risk that she might fire Johnson and find nobody else could command a majority in the Commons.\n\nThis proposal does avoid the risk that we could crash out of the EU before a snap election was held. But it still doesn\u2019t remove the Queen from the firing line. It therefore probably wouldn\u2019t be a wise course of action.\n\nIf MPs were determined to kick Johnson out, a better option would be to tighten up the Fixed Term Parliaments Act to make clear that a prime minister must resign if they lose the confidence of the Commons and somebody else can win it. Even if they have decided not to remove him for now, it might be useful to useful to change the law so they can safely launch a no-confidence vote at a later stage.\n\nDon\u2019t let Johnson become a Brexit martyr\n\nIf the rebel alliance decides to keep Johnson in Downing Street, what options does it have to ensure he obeys the law? In particular, what can it do if he is prepared to go to prison to avoid asking for a delay to Brexit, hoping to capitalise on his reputation as a \u201cBrexit martyr\u201d in a subsequent election?\n\nWell, hoping that the Queen would fire him would again be an option. After all, she couldn\u2019t have her prime minister showing contempt for her courts. But again, it would be better if she was never faced with such a dilemma.\n\nAn alternative would be to rely on the courts. They could order somebody else to ask the EU for extra time on Johnson\u2019s behalf. Section 39 of the Senior Courts Act allows the High Court to nominate somebody else to execute a document if the person who is supposed to refuses to comply. There is a similar power in the Scottish courts, which will start hearing a case on this topic on Friday.\n\nTighten up the \u2018Benn Act\u2019\n\nThese powers have never been tested in such extraordinary circumstances. One anxiety is that\n\nJohnson might find some way of running down the clock. After all, the \u201cBenn Act\u201d only requires him to ask for extra time if he hasn\u2019t persuaded the Commons to back a deal by 19 October. That is quite close to 31 October.\n\nThe Lib Dems wanted to bring forward the deadline to minimise this risk. The snag is that this could have played into Johnson\u2019s hands. He is already outrageously whipping up emotions by incorrectly describing the \u201cBenn Act\u201d as a \u201csurrender act\u201d. He says he is hoping to do a deal at the European Council on 17-18 October. If he was forced to ask for extra time before then, he would say the rebel alliance had sabotaged him.\n\nBut there is another option if the opposition is worried about running out of time. They could tighten up the Benn Act to instruct somebody else to ask the EU to delay Brexit if Johnson refuses. That would certainly be preferable than relying on the Queen to fire a delinquent prime minister.", "description": "Boris Johnson dropped heavy hints in his interview with the BBC\u2019s\u00a0Andrew Marr on Sunday that he would find some way to wriggle out of the new law requiring him to ask the EU to delay Brexit.
