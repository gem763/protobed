(AP) - Thanks to two injures and a couple of major trades, the Los Angeles Rams will be without three regular starters in their secondary this weekend in Atlanta.\n\nDefensive coordinator Wade Phillips realizes that\u2019s not the ideal way to face Julio Jones, Mohamed Sanu, Matt Ryan and the NFL\u2019s second-most prolific passing game.\n\nNot even if one of those new starters turns out to be Jalen Ramsey, who is optimistic he will make his Rams debut at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\n\n\u201c(The Falcons) have probably the top passing offense in the league, so it would be a challenge whether we had all the same people or different ones,\u201d Phillips said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge for whoever you have out there.\u201d\n\nThe Rams\u2018 defense is spending the week in frantic preparation for its new lineup against the Falcons. Starting cornerback Marcus Peters was traded on Tuesday, while safety John Johnson and cornerback Aqib Talib went on injured reserve earlier this week.\n\nRamsey went through his first full practice at the Rams\u2018 training complex Thursday, two days after the Rams acquired him from Jacksonville in an even bolder trade. Wearing the No. 20 jersey he got from new teammate Troy Hill, Ramsey looked loose and happy during the workout.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do what\u2019s smart for myself and the team, but I hope (to play Sunday), Ramsey said. \u201cI hope I can go contribute to a win, somehow, some way, whether it\u2019s limited or whatever, or a couple of plays. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nAfter requesting a trade last month, Ramsey missed the Jaguars\u2019 last three games with a back injury. Although he must learn the Rams\u2018 defense and get back into full game shape before he\u2019ll feel comfortable with his new team, Ramsey thinks he is on his way.\n\nRamsey said the defensive system \u201cfits me very well,\u201d and he called Phillips \u201ca legend\u201d in their first meeting.\n\n\u201cI love challenges like that,\u201d Ramsey said of the Falcons. \u201cThey\u2019ve got elite receivers, Julio especially, arguably one of the best receivers in the league. Definitely I love that challenge, and if I\u2019m able to perform well, I would like to be out there.\u201d\n\nThe only remaining regular starter in the Rams\u2018 secondary is safety Eric Weddle, who joined the defending NFC champions in the offseason. The veteran actually sounds eager for the challenge facing the Rams\u2018 suddenly inexperienced secondary.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you have me, quite honestly,\u201d Weddle said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through this many a time. Revolving door, whether it\u2019s safeties, corners, it\u2019s my job to get everyone on the same page and play at a high level. There\u2019s no excuses in this league, and it\u2019s my job to get those guys going.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s no denying the fact that the Rams must figure out how to win without two of their three busiest defensive players this season. Only linebacker Cory Littleton has taken more defensive snaps than Peters or Johnson for Los Angeles, while Talib is seventh despite sitting out last week with the rib injury that now threatens his season.\n\nHill is almost certain to start at cornerback for the Rams. If Ramsey doesn\u2019t play extensively, the Rams are expecting to give significant playing time to Darious Williams, a second-year pro who hasn\u2019t played a defensive snap this season and has one career tackle.\n\nThe coaching staff is high on Williams, who went undrafted in 2018 after playing two seasons at UAB. Those two seasons were in 2014 and 2017, separated by two years of training without games after the school dropped football and before the program was reinstated.\n\nThe Rams claimed Williams off waivers last October and kept him on the roster this season, but he played only four snaps on defense last season and none in six games this year.\n\nThere weren\u2019t many snaps available at cornerback recently with Peters and Talib playing extensively along with Nickell Robey-Coleman, one of the NFL\u2019s most effective nickel backs against slot receivers. Snaps are suddenly in abundance, but the Rams aren\u2019t shaken by the upheaval.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to hold strong,\u201d Robey-Coleman said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight and battle with the guys that we\u2019ve got. Having Jalen on the defense now, we don\u2019t have to worry about one half of the field, I know for sure. That made everybody\u2019s job a little easier.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Ramsey was listed as a full participant in practice, while RB Todd Gurley\u2019s participation was limited. Coach Sean McVay is optimistic Gurley will play after missing last week\u2019s game. \u2026 Gurley\u2019s backup, Malcolm Brown, missed his second straight practice with an ankle injury. McVay hasn\u2019t ruled out Brown for Sunday, noting that \u201csometimes these things end up turning the corner pretty quickly, so we\u2019ll use our time on this.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Thanks to two injures and a couple of major trades, the Los Angeles Rams will be without three regular starters in their secondary this weekend in Atlanta.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
