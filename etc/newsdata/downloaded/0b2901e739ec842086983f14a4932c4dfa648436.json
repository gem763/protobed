Everything points back to the manufacturer and how it (MCAS) was approved,\" he added.\n\nAnother expert said the aircraft's design problems trumped all else.\n\n\"Pilots can make mistakes -- they're human, but the root of the problem is the design,\" said Jakarta-based aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman.\n\n\"The MCAS was created to be able to react based on a single input only, via one computer, (and) there was no cross-checking system to confirm whether or not the input was accurate. That's the issue.\"\n\n- 'My only son' -\n\nLion Air, Southeast Asia's biggest carrier by fleet size, said Friday's report was \"essential to determine the root cause and contributing factors to the accident and take immediate corrective actions\".\n\nThe FAA said it the grounded single-aisle jet would only return to service only after it determined the model is safe.\n\nAfter receiving a briefing on the report this week ahead of its public release, some of the victims' relatives expressed disappointment.\n\n\"However, we've got no choice but to accept the report,\" said Epi Syamsul Qomar, who lost his son, after families met with investigators in Jakarta.\n\n\"People keep telling me to let go, to stay strong, but how do I do that? It's not that easy. He was my only son and I miss him every day.\"", "description": "A design flaw, inadequate pilot training and poor flight crew performance contributed to a Boeing jet crashing in Indonesia last year, killing all 189 people on board, investigators said Friday, in what one aviation analyst called a \"damning\" report.
