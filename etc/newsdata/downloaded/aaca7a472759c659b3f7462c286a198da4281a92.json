So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed it\u2019s, well\u2026\"\n\nShe then cuts to thank Tom for checking how she is doing.\n\n(Image: Collect Unknown)\n\n\"And, also thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I\u2019m OK. But it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\"\n\nFollowing up on her answer, Tom asks: \"And the answer is, would it be fair to say, not really OK, as in it\u2019s really been a struggle?\"\n\nMeghan pauses before replying simply: \"Yes\".\n\nWhile Samantha says that Meghan knew what was in store when she joined the Royal Family, one of the Duchess's friends disagrees .\n\nGina Nelthorpe-Cowne was Meghan's friend and agent for years, and the two women met for lunch in London just hours before her first date with Prince Harry .\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThey met up regularly during the early days of their relationship, and Gina recalls the moment she realised things were getting serious between them.\n\nAs a Brit, she was well aware of the pressures that would come with being publicly linked to Harry and what could happen if she ended up marrying into the Royal Family - and decided to warn her friend.\n\nSpeaking to Mail Online , she said: \"It was clear that she didn't know what she was letting herself in for. She was naive. I still think that now.\n\n\"I said, 'This is serious. This is the end of your normal life, the end of your privacy \u2013 everything.\"\n\nHowever Gina claims that Meghan wasn't interested in her advice, saying she \"didn't want to hear any negativity\" at what was a \"happy time\" for her and Harry.\n\nGina has not spoken or heard anything from her pal since a week before Meghan and Harry's engagement announcement.\n\nTheir last contact was via a lawyer who ended their professional connections.", "description": "Meghan Markle's half-sister Samantha Markle has hit out at the Duchess of Sussex for her comments in the ITV documentary Harry and Meghan: An African Adventure", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Itv", "Collect Unknown", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20725383.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BLPP_CHP_PMI_16718JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
