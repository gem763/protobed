These are secreted by glands on their body.\n\nIn addition, the insects support colonies of bacteria on their legs that also produce antibiotics.\n\nResearchers hope in the future that further work on ants will reveal natural pesticides that can be applied to fight resistant plant diseases.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nAnts can protect plants from certain diseases thanks to the infection-fighting antibiotic chemicals they secrete from their legs and bodies, a study has found\n\nBioscientists Joachim Offenberg and Christian Damgaard of Aarhus University, Denmark reviewed existing literature on interactions between ants, tropical plants and disease-caused microorganisms.\n\nThey wanted to find out if different ants' hygiene methods \u2014 which include the production of antibiotics \u2014 could have effects that extend to their host plants.\n\nThe duo had been inspired to investigate by previous research that had shown the introduction of wood ants to an apple plantation reduced the occurrence of the diseases apple rot and scab on the trees.\n\nFrom 30 reported combinations of ants, plants and microorganisms, the researchers found that ants reduced pathogen levels in 18 cases, but increases in 6.\n\nIn total, the ants' secretions appear to inhibit at least 14 different plant diseases.\n\nOn average, this equated to a pathogen reduction of 59 per cent \u2014 similar to overall effect size estimated for ants' protection of plants from herbivores.\n\nThe duo had been inspired to investigate by previous research that had shown the introduction of wood ants to an apple plantation, pictured, reduced the occurrence of the diseases apple rot and scab on the trees\n\n'We don't yet know how the ants cure the plants,' said Dr Offenberg.\n\n'But we do know that the ants secrete pheromones on their trails on the plants to find their way. And we know that some of these have antibiotic properties.'\n\n'The curing effect on plant diseases could be due to these pheromones.'\n\n'We don't yet know how the ants cure the plants,' said Dr Offenberg. 'But we do know that the ants secrete pheromones on their trails on the plants to find their way. And we know that some of these have antibiotic properties.'\n\nThe duo are hopeful that ant-derived antibiotics may yield applications in agriculture.\n\n'We hope that more research in the field will reveal new types of biological control agents that can be used in the fight against resistant plant diseases,' said Dr Offenberg.\n\nThis hope is not without precedent \u2014 past studies having discovered antibodies on African ants that are able to kill MRSA and other multi-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Oikos.", "description": "Bioscientists from Aarhus University, Denmark reviewed existing literature on interactions between ants, tropical plants and disease-caused microorganisms.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/12/19833236-0-image-a-23_1571310763467.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
