(Kevin Sousa/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIn the wake of the NBA-China scandal, Toronto Raptors fans are gearing up for a political statement for the team\u2019s home opener.\n\nA crowd-funded campaign has raised over $34,000 in five days to print thousands of t-shirts that read \u201cThe North Stand with Hong Kong\u201d for Toronto\u2019s game against the New Orleans Pelicans on October 22.\n\n\u201cWe are able to make 7,000 T shirts, which is 2,000 more than our original target! We will cover 35% instead of 25% of the audience! That\u2019s 1/3 of the arena!\u201d the group\u2019s GoFundMe page reads. The campaign was organized in part by Mimi Lee, a founder of the Torontonian HongKongers Action Group, which began hosting events in June \u201cto raise awareness and support the current pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong started by the extradition to China bill fiasco.\u201d\n\nIn the buildup to Canada\u2019s federal election on October 21, the group states:\n\nWe may have a new government by the time this NBA match happens.

In addition to deep-rooted historical ties, there are 300,000 Canadians currently working and living in Hong Kong. Canada and Hong Kong share universal values such as the rule of law, individual freedoms and human rights.\n\nThe Raptors, who won the NBA championship in June, have yet to officially comment on the shirts. The NBA has faced heavy criticism for its handling of the Daryl Morey situation, most recently as a result of LeBron James calling Morey \u201cmisinformed\u201d for his pro\u2013Hong Kong tweet.", "description": "A crowd-funded campaign has raised over $34,000 dollars in five days to print thousands of T-shirts which read \u201cThe North Stand with Hong Kong\u201d for Toronto\u2019s game against the New Orleans Pelicans on October 22.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
