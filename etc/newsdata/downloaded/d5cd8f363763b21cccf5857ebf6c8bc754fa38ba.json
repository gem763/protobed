That is a myth.\" - Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone CEO\n\n\"I don't know who writes those books or magazine articles,\" Schwarzman said. \"It doesn't work that way. We're either parts of teams that are good or weak or people who are older than us teach us and support us.\"\n\nTime wounds all deals\n\nSchwarzman has this turn of phrase because it's so difficult to get all the right people around the right table at the perfect time.\n\n\"You know, it's not unlike trying to meet somebody that you end up marrying.\" - Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone CEO\n\n\"I mean, they have to be free,\" Schwarzman said. \"They have to want to meet somebody, but if they've met somebody else in the interim, then whatever moment you thought was going to happen for you is not going to happen.\"\n\nThat personal analogy, he said, is similar to when you are trying to make a significant decision and are having trouble getting everyone in the same room in order to make that decision.\n\nOnly make decisions when you are ready and not under pressure\n\nSchwarzman said there's an intersection between being completely uncertain while going ahead with something versus being comfortable while moving forward.\n\n\"Sometimes people you work with, no matter what the setting, want to pressure you if you happen to be the senior person to make a decision right away to help them move something along,\" Schwarzman said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nSchwarzman reminded people that their decisions, whether positive or negative, could be irreversible, so it's important to take them seriously and not rush to make one.\n\nPeople tend to focus on their own problems instead of fixing someone else's\n\nSchwarzman said he's still amazed to this day how true this phrase is, but the key is to not just listen but to anticipate the problems and have proposed solutions for them.\n\n\"I was in my young 40s at the White House for some event and the president was standing [close by], and I knew some stuff was going on in the news because you could figure it out just by reading,\" Schwarzman recalled.\n\n\"And it was clear that particular president didn't have the answer yet.\" - Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone CEO\n\nSo what did Schwarzman do? He waltzed over to the Commander in Chief and spoke with him for about five minutes and was able to voice his suggested alternatives to a solution.\n\nHe said he's done this sort of thing his whole life.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nSchwarzman recently wrote a book called \"What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence\" which covers this subject matter as well as many others.", "description": "Whether it's reaching out to individuals you admire or knowing how to take a breath before making a big decision, here are some tips on how to tackle it all.", "authors": ["Blair Shiff"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/BLACKSTONE-THUMB-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
