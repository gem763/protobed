In a country like ours where women are marginalised and \u2018told\u2019 what to do and what not to do, feeling equal on a daily basis does not come easy.\n\nHowever, there is no way a woman of today is backing out or giving up. They are here to rise, to fight for what they want, to love unconditionally and to let go of the toxicity.\n\nWe are making a world of our own that we can own and feel empowered in. So we asked some women what makes them feel empowered, here are all the responses we got.\n\n1. \"When I am able to stand up for myself, or when my opinions are not only heard but also valued at work.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n2. \"I am running my own business. I feel empowered when my parents proudly say 'Beti ne khud khada kiya hai business.'\"\n\nUnsplash\n\nDon't Miss\n\n3. \"The fact that without me, without us, there will be no life and the world would come to a standstill.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n4. \"When I play an equal role in decisions in the family.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n5. \"When I come home late and I do not have to answer to anyone why I entered home at a particular time. \"\n\nUnsplash\n\n6. \" Empowerment comes with the freedom to make choices. For women, this has always been tricky. Our choices sometimes heavily depend on the prism of the society and that's sad. Be it the choice to get married at whatever age I want to or not to get married at all- the freedom to choose my life's route should be only my decision and this is what could make all of us feel empowered and that's how it should be.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n7. \" Earning a living for myself, being able to live independently and build the life I envisioned for myself as a young girl.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n8. \" The fact that I am a woman. I bleed every month and I am proud of it.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n9. \"I \u2019ve always felt empowered when trying and mastering something new. Whether it\u2019s a new project at job or climbing a rock, the fact that I am doing it all by myself without any external help, is when I feel empowered. \"\n\nUnsplash\n\n10. \"When I am able to pull out my wallet at any given point is where I feel empowered. \"\n\nUnsplash\n\n11. \"When I am hanging out with people of good influence who only make me learn a thing or two is where I feel empowered because I feel proud of my choices, the right choices. \"\n\nUnsplash", "description": "It takes a lot of effort to be a strong woman.
