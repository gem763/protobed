Rand Paul (R-KY) in 2017 \u2013 a beating that resulted in lung tissue damage and multiple broken ribs for the Kentucky lawmaker.\n\nMidler on Wednesday lashed out at Sen. Paul for condemning the Kurds, who threw vegetables at U.S. troops withdrawing from Syria, calling them \u201cingrates.\u201d\n\nThe Hocus Pocus star previewed her praise of Paul\u2019s attacker by claiming that she does \u201cNOT\u201d promote violence, but that declaration was followed by a \u201cbut\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI DO NOT promote violence but\u2026 Rand Paul says the Kurds are being \u2018ingrates\u2019 for taking their frustrations out on US troops. Which is a good reminder for us all to be more grateful for the neighbor who beat the shit out of Rand Paul,\u201d Midler said in the tweet, which has since been deleted.\n\nThe actress\u2019s tweet came as a reaction to Paul\u2019s interview on ABC News\u2019 Powerhouse Politics podcast on Wednesday, in which he reacted to the actions of Kurds who threw vegetables at U.S. troops and reportedly shouted, \u201cAmerica runs away like a mouse, the Americans are running away like mice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saved the Kurds from being beheaded and massacred by ISIS,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThey were able to win with our armament, with our Air Force, and they should be thanking us and throwing rose petals. And so, no, I\u2019m offended by them throwing refuse at our troops. And it shows them to be ingrates.\u201d\n\nLast year, Midler fantasized about Trump\u2019s family being hung \u201cGOOD AND HIGH!\u201d \u2014 a tweet she has also deleted.\n\nThe Broadway star is not alone in expressing her fantasies of violence against her political enemies publicly. On Saturday, Grammy-winning singer Barbra Streisand posted an image of House Speaker Pelosi\u2019s (D-CA) heel spearing President Trump to her 625k Twitter followers.", "description": "Left-wing actress and activist Bette Midler deleted a tweet praising the neighbor who viciously beat Sen.
