LOUIS (AP) - St. Louis\u2018 bullpen stumbled, and the Cardinals still inched closer to the NL Central title.\n\nAndrew Miller and Ryan Helsley were hit hard during an 8-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs on Friday night, but the Cardinals\u2019 magic number for clinching the division dropped to two.\n\nMiller (5-6), Helsley and Giovanny Gallegos allowed each of Chicago\u2019s runs after Dakota Hudson struck out 10 in five scoreless innings.\n\nThe Cardinals (90-70) lost their third consecutive game after winning six in a row. But their magic number for securing their first division title since 2015 was sliced to two when second-place Milwaukee lost 11-7 at Colorado.\n\nIan Happ and Robel Garcia homered for Chicago (83-77), which had lost nine in a row. The Cubs were swept in a four-game series against the Cardinals last weekend.\n\nMiller knew what was on the line when he took the mound in the seventh.\n\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t playoff games, but they\u2019re as close as you can get without being there,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt does change pretty quick and you\u2019ve got to be ready for it. It\u2019s frustrating, I didn\u2019t do my job today but (I\u2019ve got to) be ready to go tomorrow.\u201d\n\nCubs manager Joe Maddon celebrated by playing a video during his postgame press conference of Bette Midler singing \u201cRochelle, Rochelle\u201d from a \u201cSeinfeld\u201d episode in the \u201890s. He inserted Robel Garcia\u2019s first name as he sang along in his office.\n\n\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve wanted to do for a while,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cThe big blow tonight, the big blow came out of our second baseman and this explains it better than I possibly could.\u201d\n\nAlec Mills struck out nine while pitching five innings of one-run ball. But the right-hander left with a no-decision because Chicago was unable to put anything together against Hudson.\n\nSt. Louis jumped in front on Matt Carpenter\u2019s 14th homer in the fourth, but Happ tied it at 1 when he led off the sixth with his ninth homer off Gallegos.\n\nThe Cubs then went ahead to stay with seven more in the seventh. Happ hit a tiebreaking RBI double off Miller, and Wilson Contreras made it 3-1 when he scored on a wild pitch.\n\nAfter Victor Caratini was hit by a pitch, Miller was replaced by Helsley. Nico Hoerner then hit an RBI single, Garcia connected for a three-run shot and Ben Zobrist singled in Tony Kemp before Genesis Cabrera got the final out of the inning.\n\nGarcia stopped a 0-for-14 slide with his first homer since July 22. Happ finished with three hits and two RBIs.\n\nBrad Wieck (2-2) got one out for the win.\n\nMiller also struggled in his previous appearance, allowing a tying homer to Ildemaro Vargas in the Cardinals\u2019 19-inning loss at Arizona on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe had it lined up the way we wanted trying to bring home a one-run game,\u201d Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said.\n\nMills got some help from center fielder Albert Almora Jr., who made two big defensive plays against Yadier Molina.\n\nAlmora robbed Molina of a two-run double in the first and took a homer away from the catcher in the fourth, climbing over the wall. Almora pulled the ball out of his glove to show the umpires and the stunned crowd he had made the catch.\n\n\u201cFor the homer, I was dealing with cramps even before the game but I forced through it,\u201d Almora said. \u201cI don\u2019t know man, everything slows down and I was able to make a play. I was excited.\u201d\n\nCardinals rookie Tommy Edman had three hits to extend his hitting streak to nine games. Edman also picked up his 15th steal.\n\nNO LOSS FOR YOU\n\nThe Cubs haven\u2019t lost 10 games in a row since the 2012 season, when they lost 12 straight from May 15-27, 2012.\n\nNEARING THE END?\n\nWith rumors swirling about Maddon\u2019s future with the Cubs, several players made a point to have private conversations with the manager over the past few days.\n\n\u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever wanted to participate in the seminary, but I sometimes feel like \u2018Father Joe.\u2019\u201d Maddon said. \u201cThey read, they see. So, I\u2019ve had some really interesting, insightful and in-depth conversations.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nCubs: OF Nicholas Castellanos (right groin tightness) was scratched. Castellanos got hurt during a pregame routine that happened before the team took the field. He is day to day.\n\nCardinals: 2B Kolten Wong (strained left hamstring) remained out of the starting lineup for the fifth straight game. Wong said he has been going through baseball activities the last two days. \u201cI pushed it pretty good today,\u201d Wong said. \u201cI think tomorrow we\u2019ll see how it reacts and it will be a big indication of if I can get out there.\u201d \u2026 RHP Michael Wacha has a shoulder strain and general manager Michael Girsch said he\u2019s not going to throw for the next few days. \u201cProbably into the middle of next week or so,\u201d Girsch said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLeft-hander Cole Hamels (7-7, 3.92 ERA) pitches for Chicago in what might be his final game with the Cubs. Hamels can become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the year. Right-hander Adam Wainwright (14-9, 3.98 ERA) goes for his sixth consecutive win for St. Louis.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "St. Louis' bullpen stumbled, and the Cardinals still inched closer to the NL Central title.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jeff Melnick"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/cubs_cardinals_baseball_14307_c0-787-1717-1788_s1770x1032.jpg?8e3cd7c2cfba7e3477fdde2a672d7f7b76d67cb7", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
