Vatican Media/\u00adHandout via REUTERS\n\nThe pope will visit Thailand from Nov. 20 to 23 and Japan from Nov. 23 to 26.\n\nFrancis\u2019 trip to Japan will take him to Tokyo as well as the two cities hit by U.S. atomic bombs at the end of World War Two - Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Friday.\n\nThe visit will be the first papal trip to Japan since 1981.\n\nThe stop in Thailand will coincide with the 350th anniversary of the founding of the \u201cMission de Siam\u201d by Pope Clement IX to oversee missions in Siam, the former name of Thailand. The late Pope John Paul visited Thailand in 1984.\n\nCatholics are a tiny minority in mostly Buddhist Thailand, accounting for less than 2% of the population.\n\nIn announcing the Thai trip, Bangkok Archbishop Francis Xavier Kriengsak Kovitvanit said the pope\u2019s full itinerary will be announced later.\n\nThe Asian papal trip is part of Francis\u2019 push to increase dialogue with other religions in order to promote world peace.\n\nCurrently, about 1% of Japan\u2019s population is said to claim Christian belief or affiliation.\n\nChristianity was first brought to Japan by Portuguese missionaries in 1549 and banned in 1614, setting in motion a period of bloody persecution that forced the faithful to choose between martyrdom or hiding their beliefs.\n\nThis led to the development of \u201cKakure Kirishitan,\u201d or Hidden Christians, who kept their religion alive in isolated parts of Japan during the 250 years of suppression that followed the ban. Some rites took on elements of Buddhist ancestor worship, Japan\u2019s indigenous Shinto religion, and folk practices such as prayers for good crops.\n\nThe 2016 Martin Scorsese film \u201cSilence\u201d is set in Nagasaki and deals with two priests who travel from Portugal to feudal Japan to search for a mentor who has gone missing and spread the Catholic faith. It\u2019s based on a novel by Japanese author Shusaku Endo, who was Christian himself.", "description": "Pope Francis will visit Asia in November and will be the first pope in nearly four decades to make a trip to Thailand and Japan, Vatican sources said.", "authors": ["Panarat Thepgumpanat", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429354376&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0IJ", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
