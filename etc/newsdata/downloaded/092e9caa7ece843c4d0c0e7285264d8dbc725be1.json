He had quite obviously a tremendously loving family and everyone wanted to help him out.\"\n\nShe said she believed Dr Christie \"could not see the wood for the trees\" after becoming so \"poorly\" with his mental health.\n\nShe added: \"There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that he did take his own life.\n\n\"I don't think that the money worries or the work worries or any of the worries explain why.\"\n\nSpeaking after the hearing, Dr Christie's brother told of the stigma surrounding doctors and mental health.\n\nPhil Christie, 39, said: \"There is a stigma surrounding doctors and mental health.\n\n\"As people become more aware of mental health in society, we have got to become more aware of the people who are taking care of us.\n\n\"Who are looking after the people who take care of us?\n\n\"They are working in very tense environments and they are not mental health themselves.\"\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Dr Christie's widow, Juliette, says more needs to be done to support medical professionals who are reluctant to seek help for their mental health for fear it could go on their record and prohibit them from practicing.\n\nShe said: \"Suicide is far more prevalent in the medical profession generally.\n\n\"We need to understand why this might be and getting them support rather than being concerned with their ability to practice.\"\n\nDescribing her husband, she added: \"He was deeply concerned about a mental health diagnosis going on his record and affecting his ability to work.\"\n\nPhil added: \"Miles touched the lives of so many people as a beloved husband, father, son, brother, friend and as a caring doctor to the thousands of patients he looked after as a General Practitioner.\n\n\u201cMiles lived a wonderful life, seeking out and soaking up all experiences London and the world had to offer.\n\n\u201cWe will remember his beaming smile, infectious charm, his brightest of minds, and especially the sight of him unable to speak or breathe through laughter.\n\n\u201cThe outpouring of love since Miles\u2019s passing has been incredible, illustrating the joy he brought to so many people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cHe leaves a huge hole and will be dearly missed, but always remembered.\u201d\n\nA Memorial Fund in Dr Christie's name has already raised more than \u00a334,000 to support his widow and their two young children.\n\nFor confidential support, the Samaritans can be contacted for free around the clock 365 days a year on 116 123.", "description": "Dr Miles Christie walked onto Archway Bridge in north London on May 14 this year and leapt 80 feet to his death", "authors": ["Laura Sharman", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Juliette Stern", "Swns", "Alamy Stock Photo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20555459.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_DOCTOR_CHRISTIE_01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
