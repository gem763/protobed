We are seeing a weakening in earnings,\" he said Thursday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\"\n\n\"The big unknown \u2014 and Chairman Powell keeps emphasizing this \u2014 is trade, the trade war with China,\" Steil continued. \"And we're not going to get much more clarity on that until next month, and I think that's going to be the big factor going forward in the Fed's decision-making about whether to cut rates further.\"\n\nU.S. and Chinese trade officials met in Washington, D.C. on Thursday and Friday to lay the groundwork for higher-level negotiations scheduled for early October.\n\nBut those talks likely won't yield the progress investors hope to see, Steil warned.\n\n\"I think the Chinese are digging in for a long war here,\" the economist said. \"I don't think you're going to see significant concessions from the Chinese side before the next election in November 2020. You may see some token cosmetic concessions from both sides as they try to palliate the market, but I think we're a long way away from resolution of the fundamental differences between the U.S. and China.\"\n\nThat makes the job of the Federal Reserve \u2014 which cut its benchmark interest rate for the second time this year on Wednesday \u2014 increasingly difficult as it decides how best to support the U.S. economic expansion as other global economies slow, Steil said.\n\n\"It's clear that all the major banks \u2014 the Federal Reserve, the ECB, the Bank of Japan \u2014 [are] all rowing in the same direction\" when it comes to monetary policy, Steil said.\n\n\"The big difference at the moment is that the Federal Reserve is still comfortably in the territory of conventional monetary policy,\" he said. \"[With] the ECB and the BOJ, in contrast, negative interest rates and quantitative easing [is] much more difficult territory to navigate.\"\n\nBut while the Fed is unlikely to let U.S. rates dip into the red, more quantitative easing \u2014 the process of central banks buying assets from their domestic markets to spur economic activity \u2014 isn't off the table, Steil said.\n\n\"I don't think we're going to see negative rates as a policy tool. In fact, [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell has poured cold water on that. But we could very well see more QE,\" he said. \"The Fed clearly has no intention of resuming its balance sheet shrinking. I think Wall Street would welcome a foray into QE as long as they didn't see it as a sign that the Fed was predicting an imminent recession.\"\n\nAnd, at the end of the day, the outlook on U.S.-China trade will be a huge determinant in what comes next, Steil said as he looked ahead to the next week of the United Nations General Assembly's 74th annual session.\n\n\"We've got some front-burner issues, in particular the conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia, but there's that bigger issue that looms in the background: what is the future of U.S.-China relations?\" he said. \"It's clear that it's not just deteriorating on the economic front, but it's deteriorating on the broader diplomatic and security front, and that's the sort of issue that I expect people to be focusing on in the corridor.\"\n\nDisclaimer", "description": "Trade with China is the 'big unknown' for the Federal Reserve as it decides how best to support the U.S. economy, says Council on Foreign Relations Director of International Economies Benn Steil.", "authors": ["Lizzy Gurdus"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106141185-1568994792093gettyimages-1163406232.jpeg?v=1568994897", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
