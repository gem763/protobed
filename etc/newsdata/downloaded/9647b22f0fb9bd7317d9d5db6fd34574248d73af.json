I\u2019ve started better than I thought I would.\n\n\u2018This club is amazing. Coming out at the Theatre of Dreams is unbelievable.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll always love it and never get used to the sound of the fans. I want to be at the club my whole career.\n\n\u2018When I see scarves or shirts, I think: \u201cWhy have they got my name on? They could have [Paul] Pogba or [Marcus] Rashford or [Jesse] Lingard.\u201d\n\n\u2018When people ask for pictures, I\u2019ll think: \u201cYou don\u2019t want one of me, you want one with them.\u201d\u2018\n\nJames looked up to Hazard when the winger was at Chelsea (Picture: Getty)\n\nJames has lifted the lid on how, as a youngster at Swansea, he would learn from watching Hazard during the forward\u2019s time in the Premier League.\n\n\u2018The way Hazard was at Chelsea \u2013 his movement in behind, when to go and when to stay \u2013 he\u2019s so quick, but the way he stops people and goes, and little one-twos, getting shots off quickly is something he\u2019s done his whole career.\n\n\u2018Getting in the box for tap-ins is something I need to improve on. When Hazard does a one-two you can\u2019t get anywhere near him.\n\n\u2018When I was younger, people said to me you won\u2019t always be able to rely on speed. I used to just kick it past players and run \u2013 but nowadays that won\u2019t happen, especially when people bank up on me.\u2019\n\nMORE: Andy Robertson elbowed Ayoze Perez to spark fight after late Liverpool win over Leicester City", "description": "Manchester United new boy Daniel James has revealed how he tried to model his game on Eden Hazard when the Belgian was a Chelsea player.
