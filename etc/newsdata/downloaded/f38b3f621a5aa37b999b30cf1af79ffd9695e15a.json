May be possible this week. But we are not there yet.\u201d\n\nCoveney insisted it was essential to give the negotiators time to iron out the remaining difficulties.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot of work to do,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the negotiators continue at the EU\u2019s glass-and-steel Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels, Queen Elizabeth is set to deliver a speech outlining the program for government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nEU leaders, including Johnson, are meeting on Thursday and Friday to see whether a deal is possible ahead of the Brexit deadline of Oct. 31.\n\nThe challenge of maintaining an invisible border \u2014 something that underpinned both the local economy and the region\u2019s peace deal \u2014 has dominated Brexit discussions for three years since U.K. voters chose in 2016 to leave the EU.\n\nNegotiations intensified last week after Johnson and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said they could see a \u201cpathway\u201d to a divorce agreement that avoids a no-deal Brexit, something economists say would hurt both the U.K. and EU economies.\n\nIf a Brexit deal is reached, it still needs to be approved by both the British and European parliaments. Many British lawmakers - on both pro-Brexit and pro-EU sides of the debate \u2014 remain unconvinced.\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said Sunday that his party was unlikely to support any deal agreed upon by Johnson.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Brexit negotiators are meeting again Monday in an attempt to reach a deal that would allow Britain to leave the European Union with a deal at the end of the month.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jill Lawless", "Raf Casert"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/aptopix_belgium_europe_brexit_59048_c0-173-5305-3267_s1200x700.jpg?e21f5f9919780a6abdcdf828e02f9357d7ac1f3a", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
