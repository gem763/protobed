Among other things, the non-binding bill called on the House to hold a vote to open an inquiry, to allow Trump to call witnesses, and to provide congressional Republicans the power to issue subpoenas and \u201cparticipate fully\u201d in all proceedings.\n\nGraham\u2019s effort was designed as a sop to the president. In fact, the senator had just returned from lunch with Trump at the White House when he introduced his bill, and reported that the president was not at all dissatisfied with the defense he\u2019d received from the Senate GOP.\n\n\u201cI think he feels frustrated that\u2014here we go again,\u201d Graham told The Daily Beast.\n\nBut his resolution appeared only to infuriate Trumpworld at large, as it demanded that Senate Republicans hold public hearings and congressional investigations that placed the president\u2019s domestic opponents under the microscope.\n\n\u201cHe honestly probably would have been better off doing nothing than that because it\u2019s pretty clear this resolution is nothing more than a ploy to appease the base which is furious at him right now,\u201d said one Trumpworld operative.\n\nThat Graham\u2019s maneuver fell short of satisfying the political bloodlust among Trump\u2019s allies didn\u2019t go unnoticed by his colleagues, many of whom have privately griped in recent days about Trump\u2019s eagerness to air his disapproval of the very people he needs in his corner in the event of an impeachment trial. One top GOP Senate operative said that patience on the Hill is \u201cwearing thin.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exhausting and they don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know in terms of where this is going,\u201d the operative added.\n\nOther aides said that they found the attacks from Trump-allied operatives to be counterproductive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting strategy,\u201d a senior Senate GOP aide told The Daily Beast, \u201cto attack Republican senators after they try to defend you.\u201d\n\nThe friction between Senate Republicans and Trumpworld operatives could complicate an already extremely dicey situation for the White House as it tries to hold party members in line. Publicly, many GOP lawmakers in the Senate remain supportive of the president. But their declarations of support have become notably more cautious and few seemed willing to endorse the idea that they should be using their committees and offices to give Trump more cover.\n\nSen. James Lankford (R-OK) denounced the Democrats\u2019 impeachment process to The Daily Beast on Thursday, calling it \u201cbizarre\u201d and framing it as unfair to the president. But at this stage, he said, there is a limit to what the Senate can do.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this is a House issue first,\u201d said Lankford. \u201cWe're waiting to see what the House chooses to do.\u201d\n\nSen. John Kennedy (R-LA), a member of the Judiciary Committee that Graham chairs, is a frequent defender of the president and has attacked the impeachment process. But when asked if the Senate could do more, he said, \u201cIt's difficult when you can't see the evidence.\u201d He also backed up Graham in his reluctance to call witnesses at this stage. \u201cWe can't, because impeachment starts in the House.\u201d\n\nIf Graham were to hold judiciary hearings to interview different witnesses and establish a counter-narrative more favorable to Trump, it\u2019s unlikely that Senate rules and precedent would allow for a process that many Trump backers might want to see.\n\nAccording to several Senate veterans, the rules of the chamber do dictate that Graham would have to grant Democrats on his committee the chance to call witnesses selected by the minority members of that committee. It is possible, several aides said, that Graham could move to scrap or reset the rules of his committee, though it\u2019s unclear if he\u2019d be successful and doing so would represent a massive breach in norms and risk upending future committee business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we never considered when we were there,\u201d said Greg Nunziata, who was formerly senior Republican counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cThe majority and minority historically work in concert in planning hearings. The majority does call the majority of witnesses, but it is practice is to allow the minority to call witnesses as well.\u201d", "description": "A sense of irritation is setting in among Senate Republicans as President Donald Trump and his close political allies demand more aggressive pushback to the House impeachment investigation.\u00a0On Thursday, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) introduced a symbolic resolution condemning the Democrats\u2019 impeachment", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Sam Stein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N3C4O72_QOHl7uwO02ZkKA--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/33879f744926f88c93cbbb12c8cb795a", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
