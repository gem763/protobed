LeBron James spoke on the issue this week for the first time, saying he thought Morey was \u201cmisinformed\u201d about the situation. He later tried to clarify his comments, saying he was talking about the \u201cramifications of the tweet,\u201d not the actual substance of it.\n\nFriday\u2019s protest is just the latest in the NBA-China saga since the tweet earlier this month, which effectively erased the Rockets from China completely. NBA commissioner Adam Silver \u2014 whose first statement after the incident criticized Morey and called his actions \u201cregrettable\u201d \u2014 has since seemingly changed sides on the issue, especially after politicians from both sides of the isle came together to criticize him and the league for caving to communist nation.\n\nSilver opened up about the issue again on Thursday in an interview with Good Morning America\u2019s Robin Roberts, and confirmed that China asked him to fire Morey over the tweet. Silver said he shut that down and that \u201cthere\u2019s no chance\u201d the league disciplines Morey at all.\n\nThe incident has caused an immense loss of revenue already, too \u2014 not just for the Rockets, who have millions of Chinese fans, but for the league as a whole. Many teams have already explored scenarios where the salary cap drops 10 to 15 percent as a result of the incident. Silver said Thursday that the league is willing to cope with whatever happens next with China, even if the financial consequences \u201ccontinue to be fairly dramatic.\u201d\n\nThe NBA\u2019s regular season is now just days away, and the league\u2019s China controversy hasn\u2019t disappeared. Based on the protest at the Barclays Center on Friday night, it\u2019s not going to anytime soon, either.\n\nKyrie Irving on the Barclays Center protests\n\nKyrie Irving made his Barclays Center debut on Friday night, dropping a team-high 19 points in the loss while shooting 7-of-17 from the field.\n\nIrving \u2014 while wearing a \u201cprotect kids, not guns\u201d shirt \u2014 was asked about the protests at the arena after the game, something that would have been hard to miss from the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAmerica was built on protesting, built on slavery...\u201d pic.twitter.com/DThliHG9gf \u2014 Malika Andrews (@malika_andrews) October 19, 2019\n\n\u201cWhen you think about communities across the world, I think that a lot of people would stand for world peace,\u201d Irving said, via ESPN\u2019s Malika Andrews. \u201cGovernment gets involved and impacts different communities in different ways. The reality is that as individuals, it\u2019s our job to stand up for what we believe in. \u201cNow I understand that Hong Kong and China is dealing with their issues, respectively, but there\u2019s enough oppression and stuff going on in America for me to not be involved in the community issues here as well. That\u2019s one of those four pillars that goes in the black community, colored people here still in America. Like we\u2019re still fighting for everyday freedom. \u201cWhen I think about Hong Kong and China, the people are in an uproar. For us as Americans to comment on it, us as African Americans or American Indians to comment on that, you\u2019re connected nonetheless \u2014 especially when it impacts freedoms or world peace. \u201cFor me, as an individual, I stand up for those four pillars. When they\u2019re being conflicted, I can understand why protesters come to the game. America was built on protesting, built on slavery \u2026 But things happen all across the world and we\u2019re just taking notice and social media puts it right in front of everyone\u2019s faces. If you\u2019re not thinking with a selfless attitude, then you can come out and kind of get yourself caught up in a few things politically that really impacts a certain group of people in an area of the world.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Even though the NBA\u2019s China controversy is now weeks old, the issue clearly isn\u2019t going away.", "authors": ["Ryan Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/F.L5F41YnRuo1lcVAFPRzA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sQcRPsB9SmtfgUB9qDazeg--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/b6121e30-f210-11e9-a1ff-ed902d12aa87", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
