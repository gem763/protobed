On Tuesday, we'll hear from uniform supplier Cintas Corp. ( CTAS ) . Cramer recommended Cintas. Let's check to see if there is enough starch in the charts.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of CTAS, below, we can see a strong rally from the low in late December. Prices stayed above the rising 50-day simple moving average line into September. Prices broke below the 50-day line this month and have recently rallied back to the underside of this math-based indicator. Prices are still well above the rising 200-day moving average line.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a confirming rise from December and recently made a new high for the move up.\n\nThe trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is poised to cross to the upside for a cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of CTAS, below, we can see that prices have come a long way in the past three years. CTAS is above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is bullish but the MACD oscillator has crossed to the downside for a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of CTAS, below, we can see a potential downside price target of $221.\n\nBottom line strategy: Was the price weakness in September a \"shot across the bow\" message that the earnings numbers could disappoint? I don't know but with a Point and Figure price target at the intersection of the 200-day moving average line, a cautious approach might be needed in the near-term.", "description": "Was the price weakness in September a 'shot across the bow' message?...CTAS", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "The Charts Of Cintas Suggest A Cautious Approach Ahead Of Earnings", "Was The Price Weakness In September A 'Shot Across The Bow' Message", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Bob Lang", "Timothy Collins", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Jonathan Heller", "Carolyn Boroden", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/cintas-large.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
