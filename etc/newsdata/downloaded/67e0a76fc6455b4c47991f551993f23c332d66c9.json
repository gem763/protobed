As party president, Haworth oversaw the investigation of the complaint and several others levelled at the staffer by a string of Labour members.\n\n\u201cIn the last 48 hours I have read incredibly distressing reports of an alleged sexual assault involving members of the Labour party,\u201d Ardern said on Wednesday. She said correspondence from complainants had confirmed the allegations \u201cwere extremely serious, that the process caused complainants additional distress, and that ultimately, in my view, the party was never equipped to appropriately deal with the issue\u201d.\n\nShe said Howarth had stood by his previous statements but she added: \u201cI believe mistakes were made.\u201d\n\nArdern apologised to the alleged victims, and extended an offer to meet. \u201cRaising an allegation of sexual assault is an incredibly difficult thing to do; for additional distress to be caused through the way those allegations are handled is incredibly upsetting,\u201d she said.\n\nThe alleged victim told the Spinoff she reported the 2018 assault to senior Labour party members last year, including Haworth, but that they failed to act, and cleared the man of six separate complaints after conducting an internal investigation. She said inaction by senior party figures had left her feeling \u201cangry, quite fearful and desperate\u201d.\n\nNew Zealand Labour faces sexual assault crisis as Jacinda Ardern sets up inquiry Read more\n\nShe is reportedly one of seven people to have complained about the Labour staffer. The staffer was cleared of any wrongdoing by an internal Labour investigation, and has faced no disciplinary action.\n\nArdern said this week that the media report was the first time she had heard that the allegation was of a sexual nature. \u201cI\u2019m obviously incredibly frustrated, disappointed and concerned about this situation and the competing advice I have received,\u201d she said.\n\nThe prime minister said a QC would investigate how the party responded to the allegations of misconduct and sexual assault.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest New Zealand Labour party president Nigel Haworth.

I would be happy to meet with complainants ... I will take steps to make that offer available to them if they wish to take it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have made it clear that I want the QC-led appeal process to resolve this matter,\u201d she said. \u201cI also want to assure myself that appropriate victim support and advocacy have been put in place around the complainants.\u201d\n\nThe complainants have not detailed their allegations to the police.\n\nThis is not the first time the Labour party has been accused of negligence regarding accusations of sexual assault. At a young Labour summer camp in 2018, a 21-year-old attendee was charged with groping and inappropriately touching and kissing four other attendees after excessive drinking. The case is before the courts.\n\nAustralian Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Jacinda Ardern says allegations in question are \u2018incredibly distressing\u2019 and offers to meet alleged victims", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c54a703184515bdc04251e6178cf95b1f8a0d862/1116_291_2034_1220/master/2034.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bd7e0eabc5bad6abed828b144889a2ea", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
