Yang, the cheerful prophet of doom; Williamson, the spiritual healer; Gabbard, the teller of hard truths about American imperialism; and Sanders, well, he\u2019s just Bernie. But they have something important in common: They don\u2019t fit the mold. They aren\u2019t in the club. They defy the rules.\n\nAsian techies are supposed to develop the latest AI, not lead the revolution to put humanity first. Democratic female veterans are supposed to burnish the party\u2019s hawkish cred, not doggedly pursue diplomacy and engagement and call out the American war machine. Spirituality is not supposed to be mixed with politics on the left, even though religion is fully weaponized by the right. And septuagenarian democratic socialists who are not fashionable in any way are not supposed to be rock stars with youths or be top-polling presidential contenders.\n\nRather than deal with these contradictions \u2014 which, by the way, clearly fascinate the public, judging by Google and Twitter trends \u2014 it\u2019s easier for many in the media to mock, smear or ignore.", "description": "", "authors": ["Krystal Ball", "Thehill.Com Opinion Campaign"], "top_image": ""}
