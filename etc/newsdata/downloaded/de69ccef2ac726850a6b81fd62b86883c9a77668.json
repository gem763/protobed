France still has to play England, too, but having already got past Argentina, the French may not need _ yet _ to beat England to advance.\n\n\u201cThis is a final,\u201d hooker and former Pumas captain Agustin Creevy says. \u201cWe are fully confident.\u201d\n\nEngland has a lot at stake in Tokyo, too. A win qualifies it for the quarterfinals after embarrassingly missing out in 2015 in its home tournament.\n\nEngland is as fully confident as the Pumas, with even more reason to be.\n\nEngland has beaten up Argentina for the past decade, winning nine straight tests. The English won their only previous two World Cup matchups, although both had to be toughed out. England prevailed 24-18 in 1995 in Durban, and needed a Ben Youngs converted try in the 67th minute to win 13-9 in 2011 at Dunedin.\n\nEngland\u2019s confidence is high after winning its opening two pool matches against Tonga and the United States, scoring 80 points and conceding 10. And it has had two extra days of preparation for its first Tier One opponent.\n\nAnd for the first time in ages, coach Eddie Jones was excited to have a fully fit squad of 31 to choose from. He reverted to the lineup which dispatched Tonga with only one change: George Kruis was in the second row with Maro Itoje, and Courtney Lawes has dropped to the reserves.\n\nThe reserves also feature prop Mako Vunipola and winger Jack Nowell. Vunipola tore his hamstring from the bone in May, and tore the scar tissue after 17 minutes against Ireland in August. Nowell has been nursing an ankle ligament problem since June.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a credit to our strength and conditioning staff and medical staff what a great condition we\u2019re in,\u201d Jones enthused.\n\nThe Pumas are also in good shape. They made only one change to the starting lineup, recalling No. 8 Javier Ortega Desio, who played against France, for Tomas Lezana from the win over Tonga last Saturday.\n\nHooker Julian Montoya and flyhalf Benjamin Urdapilleta have been retained after replacing veterans Creevy and Nicolas Sanchez. Sanchez, who was in the reserves against Tonga, has missed out on the matchday 23. The inexperienced Lucas Mensa is the cover. Record caps holder Creevy is in the reserves, though.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a pretty good team if they can get Creevy to come off the bench,\u201d Jones says.\n\nThe England coach is usually quick with hyperbole, but has been paying tribute this week and left the banter to Creevy, who knows England and its game well from two seasons in the Premiership. Creevy reportedly said this pool game \u201cis going to be like a war,\u201d and described England as structured and boring, meaning he knows what\u2019s coming: \u201cThey are Anglo-Saxon: No risks, very tidy.\u201d\n\nDealing with that isn\u2019t easy, he admits. They need to match England up front, be composed and not give away penalties because Owen Farrell is unerring. The breakdown will be big, captain Pablo Matera and Marcos Kremer against England tyros Sam Underhill and Tom Curry.\n\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s very exciting,\u201d Creevy says. \u201cWe are never the favorites (against England), and I don\u2019t know what that feels like. If we win, we stay. If not, we\u2019re out.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nEngland: Elliot Daly, Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell (captain), Jonny May, George Ford, Ben Youngs; Billy Vunipola, Sam Underhill, Tom Curry, George Kruis, Maro Itoje, Kyle Sinckler, Jamie George, Joe Marler.
