With her purple-streaked hair, dinosaur-emblazoned apron, and reporter\u2019s sense of curiosity, Cases makes a point to learn the background of each \u201cpatient\u201d that comes through her door.\n\n\u201cBehind every teddy bear, there is a story,\u201d Casas, 72, told The Daily Beast. \u201cI have my way to get it. I\u2019m very curious, and people always like to talk.\u201d\n\nAfter 30 years in the business, Casas has heard it all. She has worked on dolls rescued from Nazi Germany, teddies that immigrated to the U.S. alongside their owners, and toys that miraculously survive devastating fires.\n\n\u201cRich, poor, middle class, whatever\u2014they come to the doll hospital,\u201d Casas said. \u201cEven if you are very poor, you get attached to a doll or teddy bear, and you want to get it fixed. Sometimes it\u2019s the only family that they have. They want to fix it, clean it, it\u2019s very valuable to them.\u201d\n\nOne yarn, seemingly plucked from a romance paperback, stars a repeat customer who comes to the shop annually. Ever year, he requests that a dress be made for a doll \u201cthat\u2019s sort of like a clown, but not really a clown.\u201d For years, he would burst into tears upon seeing the new creation.\n\n\u201cWe asked him why he was crying,\u201d Casas recalled. \u201cAnd he told us that when he was in Italy on his honeymoon with his wife, he bought her that doll.\u201d The doll came with a book of outfits. Soon after they returned from the trip, she died in a car accident.\n\n\u201cEvery year he got a new outfit made for the doll, for his wife,\u201d Casas said.\n\nOver the years, Casas has searched for some kind of apprentice, a new generation to pass the business along to. No such hire ever lasts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to train people to work in this,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot find them. All the work is done by hand, and you have to work hard. Who is going to sit with a needle and sew a whole day? Two days, three days, one week on a teddy bear! No one. We are living in another world now.\u201d\n\nThough Casas has no plans to close her practice, she readily admits the industry is dying in an era where birthday gifts skew less Barbie and more iPads.\n\n\u201cThe technology is killing us, really,\u201d she sighed. \u201cYou used to buy dolls and teddy bears for children\u2014today, they buy a phone first, or sophisticated, electronic toys. That\u2019s taking business from us.\u201d\n\nThat may be so, though dolls will not go down without a fight.\n\nThe bad news: in 2017, MarketWatch reported that sales for the behemoth American Girl Doll were down 30 percent since the previous year.\n\nThe good news: a study from NPD Group showed that while sales of toys overall declined from 2017 to 2018, dolls experienced a boost of 7 percent.\n\nThough niche, the doll repair industry is surprisingly well-connected. The national Doll Doctors Association runs a newsletter, online database of \u201chospitals,\u201d and other events. Next week, the Missouri-based United Federation of Doll Clubs will hold its 70th annual convention in Nashville.\n\nDoll hospitals might seem like something straight out of Louisa May Alcott, but the phenomenon boasts an international history. One of the first ever was founded in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1830, and it remains in operation. Another in Melbourne, Australia, has refurbished toys since around 1888 in various storefronts around the city.\n\nCasas works out of a shop she started with her husband, Luis, who passed away in February after a long battle with Alzheimer's. It was Luis who introduced his future wife to the world of doll repair in the late 1960s, when she was a travel agent in her early twenties. The two met in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, and Luis\u2019 mother spent her adult life working in a toy hospital.\n\n\u201cWhen [Luis] was a kid on his school vacations, he would go to the factory to work,\u201d Casas recalled.\n\nThings were different for Ines, who said she grew up \u201cvery poor\u201d with five sisters.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any toys when I was a little girl,\u201d she recalled. \u201cNone. My parents couldn\u2019t buy us any.\u201d\n\n\u201c They told us, in the U.S. everyone just throws things away and don\u2019t keep them, that\u2019s the concept people have. But my husband said no, wherever there are children, they must have a doll hospital. \u201d \u2014 Ines Casas, owner of Secaucus Doll and Teddy Bear Hospital\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the couple traveled to New York City and searched for work. Friends back home discouraged them from leaving. \u201cThey told us that in the U.S., everyone just throws things away and don\u2019t keep them. That\u2019s the concept people have. But my husband said, \u2018No, wherever there are children, they must have a doll hospital.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe searched Yellow Pages and found New York Doll Hospital, a much-loved Upper East Side institution run by Irving Chais. (Chais\u2019 family began the New York Doll Hospital in 1900; it closed its doors after his death over a hundred years later in 2009.)\n\nLuis met with Chais, who had a bare-bones staff, to put out feelers. One year later, the couple returned to Manhattan for good, arriving on a Sunday and securing jobs at the hospital on Monday. The next week they began working\u2014Luis in the store and Ines back at their apartment\u2014and they stayed on for 23 years.\n\nAfter Chase\u2019s death, the couple founded their own shop in Secaucus, New Jersey, out of a humble storefront sandwiched in between a hairdresser and pizza shop. Of course, dolls outnumber the staff (Casas, her sister-in-law Alba, and daughter Jeannette) by approximately a thousand to three.\n\nOn a recent Wednesday afternoon, one chestnut-haired child\u2019s head\u2014and no body\u2014sat upon a desk, waiting to be reunited with its torso.\n\nTwo stark naked dolls sat together, holding hands, with adult-sized curlers hanging from their hair. \u201cIt\u2019s just like a beauty parlor!\u201d Casas laughed.\n\nNearby, her daughter Jeanette surveyed a white bin full of tiny plastic babies, which she estimated were around 50 years old.\n\n\u201c Doll care is not a lucrative business. Most of the time the doll that I\u2019m fixing isn\u2019t worth the price that I\u2019m charging\u2014but that\u2019s not the goal. The goal is to fix a doll for a child, or an adult child, who still loves it. \u201d\n\nThe industry, the hard work: it's all a labor of a very specialized love.\n\nLisa Eddins, who runs a doll repair business out of her home in Orange Park, Florida, bluntly told The Daily Beast that, \u201cDoll care is not a lucrative business. Most of the time the doll that I\u2019m fixing isn\u2019t worth the price that I\u2019m charging\u2014but that\u2019s not the goal. The goal is to fix a doll for a child, or an adult child, who still loves it.\u201d\n\nOne woman based in Ontario, Canada, who only wanted to go by Dr. Darci, is 56 years old and \u201csemi-retired.\u201d She has worked in doll repair since she encountered a box of toys at an antique show in the 1970s and \u201cfelt sorry\u201d for the figurines: \u201cI decided I needed to learn how to fix them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy older customers have commented that there used to be a doll hospital in ever city,\u201d Dr. Darci said. \u201cNow, one lady drives two hours just to see me. I\u2019m the only one in my province. Things used to get saved; now it\u2019s more of a throwaway society.\u201d\n\nMost of the artists who spoke with The Daily Beast ran their businesses out of their home, or as side hustles. \u201cI don\u2019t need the income from it,\u201d Dr. Darci admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great time-killer when the Canadian weather gets bad. I sit down, pick up a broken doll, and start fiddling with it.\u201d\n\nTeresa Klein of Milford, Indiana, got into doll repair while caring for young daughters in the mid-to-late 1990s. It was the height of the collectable craze, when Americans were lining up to buy special edition Beanie Babies in hopes of striking it rich after reselling.\n\n\u201cIt seems like nowadays, people have smaller houses or aren\u2019t into collecting as much,\u201d Klein mused. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to keep whatever collection their parents have.\u201d\n\n\u201c You make people happy. I\u2019ve got grabbed and hugged and kiss and cried on. It is very fulfilling. \u201d\n\nNow 55, Klein makes a point to give presentations and lessons at her local doll club. \u201cI want to hand off some of that knowledge to the younger ladies,\u201d she said.\n\nOne reason Klein suggests millennials get into the business? \u201cYou make people happy,\u201d she offered. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten grabbed and hugged and kissed, and cried on. It is very fulfilling.\u201d\n\nDoll repair workers seem generally affable and friendly. If there is any controversy in what they do it, is the public\u2019s assumption that all dolls are creepy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t try to ascribe feelings to plastic or metal,\u201d Madeline Grudens, 54, of the Stony Brook Doll Hospital in New York, said. \u201cA lot of that is just made-up TV stuff. It\u2019s just a piece of wood, and I\u2019ve got to fix it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel that they\u2019re creepy,\u201d Dr. Darci insisted. \u201cThat\u2019s always bugged me\u2014I see a decrepit doll on eBay and think, \u2018Oh, that just needs some fixing.\u2019 But it will be listed as a \u2018haunted doll.\u2019\u201d\n\nA woman who goes by the name of Twila Cheeseborough and lives in Punta Gorda, Florida, sells \u201chaunted dolls\u201d on Etsy. She works as a kind of reverse doll doctor, finding vintage toys and turning them into nightmarish figurines with gouged out eyes, bloodied bodies, and decaying teeth.\n\nA former psychic, Twila also believes that dolls can be haunted, but she only sells ones she\u2019s sure contain spirits. Her latest \u201cpossessed\u201d project \u201cspoke to her\u201d via a paranormal app, Spirit Box, telling her it was the ghost incarnate of a woman named Ella Mason. A search through newspaper archives showed that a woman with the same name was murdered in Iowa in 1884.\n\n\u201cSince she came into the house, things have happened to me that are unbelievable,\u201d Twila said. \u201cDeaths and the ending of a nine year relationship. I removed her from my house, but she is available for sale.\u201d To anyone who may be interested: Ella Mason costs $599.\n\nThe Doll Doctor's Association keeps tabs on all the hospitals still running in the United States; and there are over 50 businesses listed, from Massachusetts to Texas, Washington state and California. (Curiously, western states like Montana, Wyoming, Indiana, Nevada, and Utah are not represented on the map.)\n\nGrudens, from Long Island, said that the rise of 3-D printing has spurred interest in ball-jointed dolls, the ones whose limbs can move in various directions. On YouTube, videos showing before-and-afters of refurbished Barbies and Bratz rack up hundreds of thousands of views.\n\nNext week at the United Federation of Doll Club's \u201cStar Struck\u201d convention, attendees can visit exhibits highlighting \u201ccelebrity dolls of stage and screen,\u201d \u201cJapanese fashion dolls,\u201d and over 70 years of souvenirs from the federation's museum archives.\n\nThere will also be workshops and seminars on everything from how to make \u201ccouture\u201d costumes and art deco figurines.\n\nKlein, from Indiana, has a sense of humor about the macabre connotations of her work. \u201cI have arms, legs, eyeballs in jars,\u201d she laughed. \u201cFingers, hands, and heads looking at you, oh yeah.\u201d\n\nWhen her daughters were teenagers and dating, she would bring suitors into her workroom and show them decapitated bodies. \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018As long as you\u2019re nice to my daughter, your head won\u2019t end up here.\u2019\u201d", "description": "From Florida to Canada, doll repair workers are trying to save a much-loved industry from death, one teddy bear at a time.", "authors": ["Alaina Demopoulos", "Style Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1563479991/190718-alaina-doll-hospital-tease_l4cnlu"}
