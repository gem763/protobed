Women simply can\u2019t compete. If they could, it wouldn\u2019t be so easy for bigger, tougher, stronger, male-bodied competitors to trounce them. We\u2019re seeing a revolution in women\u2019s sports, and it\u2019s not coming from the female-bodied competitors but their betters. Why else would women athletes be revolting?\n\nTrans women athletes are fierce, formidable, and frankly better in all competitive categories except women\u2019s gymnastics, and that\u2019s only because that\u2019s a sport that was dumbed down from the male version to be better suited to weaker bodies. Simone Biles may be the world\u2019s most decorated gymnast, but she wouldn\u2019t be half so medaled if she had to face small competitors reared in testosterone-filled bodies.\n\nIn rugby, weightlifting, cycling, and track and field, transgender athletes who were born male perform at higher levels than their female-bodied counterparts. Referees for women\u2019s rugby in the United Kingdom can testify to how much better trans players are. Kelly Morgan, a trans woman who plays in the Welsh women\u2019s league, is so powerful that, the club captain said, she once \u2018folded an opponent \u201clike a deckchair\u201d\u2019. As the injuries mount on the field, women should take note and give their spots on the team to the trans athletes that deserve them.", "description": "", "authors": ["Spectator.Us Face-Women-Suck-Sports"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
