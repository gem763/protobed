It plans to build an upgraded version of the aircraft which it calls F-21.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is pushing a Make-in-India program under which it wants global firms, including in the defense sector, to set up manufacturing centers in India to build a domestic industrial base and create jobs.\n\nA US-made F16 jet fighter takes off for a training exercise during military exercises in eastern Taiwan. Chiang Ying-ying/AP\n\nVivek Lall, vice president of Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, said the wings of all future F-16s that the company will sell worldwide will be produced in a joint venture with India's Tata Advanced Systems in the southern city of Hyderabad.\n\n\"The first wing prototype is being built now. The expectation is we will begin supplying by next year sometime, this will be the sole facility for future F-16 wing production,\" Lall told Reuters.\n\nLockheed is competing for the Indian air force contract with Boeing, which has pitched its F/A-18 Super Hornet, as well as Sweden's Saab with its Gripen fighter. France's Dassault Systemes SE's Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon and Russian aircraft are also in the fray.\n\nThe air force needs new fighter jets to replace its aging fleet of Russian MiG planes. But Indian defense procurement is a lengthy process.\n\nThe government's insistence on local manufacture and reduced reliance on expensive imports has delayed decision-making further as foreign firms search for local partners and suppliers.\n\nAn F-16 jet fighter flies over the NATO airbase in Aviano, Italy, March 21, 2011.

There were 500 people each involved in two joint ventures set up for the production of the empennage and the cabin.\n\n\"We have been doing make-in-India for years now,\" he said. The company has said if it sets up a local production base for the F-16 it will also provide maintenance, repair and spares for the combat jet flying with air forces around the world.\n\nLall said that with 3,000 F-16s flying around the world and more orders being negotiated with countries such as Bahrain, Lockheed estimated there was a market worth $165 billion for after-sales support.\n\n\"It is a huge potential business, India will be plugging into the world's largest fighter jet ecosystem.\"\n\n(Reporting by Sanjeev Miglani; Editing by Jane Merriman and David Evans)", "description": "Lockheed Martin will begin supplying wings for its F-16 combat jets from a facility in southern India from in 2010, a senior executive said Thursday.", "authors": ["Sanjeev Miglani"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5b6b514d1982d81e008b4de5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
