Only a win in Tokyo will reignite Los Pumas\u2019 chances of qualifying for the quarter-finals after the opening defeat by France. Losing would send them home with a dead-rubber game against the USA to be negotiated four days later.\n\nIn 160 minutes of rugby so far, Argentina were abysmal against France in the first half and very good in the second but left it too late, losing a game they should win from there nine out of 10 times; they started strongly against Tonga only to drop their performance in the last 50 minutes.\n\nArgentina heartbreak after Camille Lopez\u2019s drop goal rescues France Read more\n\nBeyond form, the task is also defined by the fact that the last time Argentina beat England was a decade ago in Salta, and both their previous World Cup encounters have gone in England\u2019s favour.\n\nIn the face of that challenge, Ledesma has remarkably dropped Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez, Argentina\u2019s top points scorer and a regular for the last nine seasons while also placing the former captain Agust\u00edn Creevy on the bench.\n\nThere has been plenty of debate about Argentina\u2019s ability to reach its minimum goal of the knockout stages since Ledesma announced the squad for the tournament, and now he has dropped the country\u2019s top scorer from the playing 23 it has added fuel to the fire. S\u00e1nchez has 733 points \u2013 11 tries, 102 conversions, 146 penalties and 12 drops \u2013 to his name since his first international in 2010.\n\nNeedless to say, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s absence from Saturday\u2019s squad was a big topic at the team announcement. \u201cIt is a tough moment for Nico but the team is bigger than its players,\u201d Ledesma said. \u201cHe is not the only one that wasn\u2019t selected. We were thinking about what is best for the team and we believe this is the team that can beat England. We are always thinking [about] what is best for Argentine rugby.\u201d\n\nFor Ledesma that also meant selecting Juli\u00e1n Montoya at hooker \u2013 man of the match against Tonga \u2013 ahead of Creevy, who will become his country\u2019s most capped international with 88 presuming he takes over from Montoya at some stage of today\u2019s Saturday\u2019s game.\n\nThe big surprise among the replacements was the inclusion of Lucas Mensa, with one solitary cap and not a member of the Super Rugby side Jaguares, ahead of S\u00e1nchez.\n\nOn Friday the reserve scrum-half Felipe Ezcurra insisted that the whole team could learn from S\u00e1nchez\u2019s reaction to his omission. \u201cNico is an example \u2026 in terms of how he is conducting himself and how he transmits to everyone that the important thing is the group and not individuals. That makes us very strong.\u201d\n\nBut there is a wider significance to S\u00e1nchez not being in the team. It means that if anything was to happen to the incumbent fly-half, Benjam\u00edn Urdapilleta, there is no natural No 10 to replace him as Mensa prefers to play at 12. Ledesma has taken a huge risk.\n\n\u201cUrdapilleta has proven himself in France, playing 80 minutes in very big games [including winning the Top 14 final],\u201d Ledesma added. \u201cWe will have two playmakers as Jer\u00f3nimo de la Fuente is who best knows our system. If needed, he\u2019ll move to 10.\u201d\n\nDespite studying England ad nauseum, Ledesma nonetheless preferred not to discuss Saturday\u2019s opponents, save for a brief analysis of their tactical kicking game, and how they would need to deal with it. In this team selection, Emiliano Boffelli will be in charge of dealing with the bombs.\n\nJones, meanwhile, has probably had to put his analyst on overtime to find out about Urdapilleta.\n\nThere is no going back now for Argentina and Ledesma, who made the decision with the input of his coaching team. A shock win over England will give him the opportunity to take a place in Argentinian rugby\u2019s folklore. And as for what a loss would mean, it was hard to tell from his stance.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest game in this team\u2019s history,\u201d he said. \u201cLos Pumas have had very important games in their proud history and now these players have the opportunity of being part of that history.\u201d\n\nLisandro Olearo is a rugby writer for El Ciudadano", "description": "Mario Ledesma has dropped Argentina\u2019s top points-scorer Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez for a game they have to win to reach the quarter-finals", "authors": ["Lisandro Olearo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc697bad47a988dd096c2e1a5db8f8cecfdd4818/0_55_4400_2639/master/4400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=425f7eb8f1f20eb10c96a7e6c751d788", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
