As there appear to be no branching, tree-like tributaries feeding into the main valley of Nirgal Vallis, it is likely that water was replenished on ancient Mars by a mix of precipitation and overland flow from the surrounding terrain.\n\nThe system may also have its roots in a process known as groundwater sapping: when water struggles to travel vertically through a medium, and so instead continually seeps laterally through material in layers beneath the surface.\n\nWe see this kind of mechanism on Earth in environments where surface material is very fine and loose and thus difficult for water to penetrate \u2013 largely silty, sandy, unconsolidated, and fine-grained environments, where lower layers of the surface are permeable and friendlier to water than those above.", "description": "Spanning nearly 435 miles on the surface, the valley stream is named Nirgal Vallis and experts say it was shaped by flowing water and impacts -- which may have occurred 4 billion years ago.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/23/19809576-0-image-a-87_1571263282158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
