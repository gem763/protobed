That's all good, but we're in there.\u201d When the senator said that \u201cthe left\u201d used to agree with him on regime change, Goldberg told him, \u201cI am not left or right, I'm just American. And I want to know, should we be walking out on them?\u201d\n\nAs the rest of the co-hosts started jumping into the conversation, Paul grew more and more agitated. \u201cThere's a difference in having a strategy and leaving the Kurds there to die, which is where they are now,\u201d Abby Huntsman told him. \u201cThey were left there to die. And now it\u2019s the GOP\u2019s problem.\u201d\n\nWhen it was Navarro\u2019s turn to speak, she pressed Paul to defend America \u201cbreaking our word to allies,\u201d asking, \u201cWhat message does that send internationally to other allies if we abandon them?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only duty we owe, and the only oath I take is to the Constitution,\u201d Paul replied. \u201cI didn't promise to take the country to war, I promised not to take the country to war. So did President Trump by the way.\u201d He added, \u201cAnyone who tries to make the argument someone in Syria is a danger to our country, is not paying attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I think Assad is in Syria and a danger to our country and our world!\u201d Navarro responded before Paul attempted to explain the \u201cvery complicated\u201d Middle East to the panel, shouting \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt!\u201d when Huntsman tried to get a word in. He was still talking when Goldberg threw to commercial.\n\nThe tension only ratcheted up after the break when the crew started talking to Paul about his book. Again, it was Navarro who got under Paul\u2019s skin by asking if he thinks it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d for Trump and Republican Party to run ads that say, \u201cIf you vote for Democrats, they will turn the United States into Venezuela.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you vote for a socialist, you might get socialism,\u201d Paul answered with a smirk.\n\n\u201cCome on, don't do that!\u201d Navarro said. \u201cMaduro is not a socialist. He's a corrupt, murderous thug who is starving his people.\u201d When Paul denied those facts, Navarro added, \u201cThat\u2019s not true? Maduro is not a thug and murderer who is starving his people?\u201d\n\nAs Paul attempted to argue his point, Navarro interrupted him with, \u201cI can't let you finish. If you are going to say Maduro is not a murderous thug, I\u2019m not letting you finish because that's a damn lie!\u201d While Goldberg was trying to end the segment, Paul literally waved his hands in Navarro\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this to me, don\u2019t mansplain,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m a 47-year-old grown woman!\u201d", "description": "The Republican senator\u2019s flailing performance did not win over anyone on \u201cThe View\u201d Friday morning.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1438,w_2556,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570811420/RP_b3htfg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
