But making that information unavailable invisibilizes that.\"\n\nThe Ontario Provincial Police will no longer use \"he\" or \"she\" when they disclose arrests to the public. Instead, they've decided to stay gender-neutral. 5:18\n\nCan lead to assumptions\n\nLeigh said withholding gender isn't such an issue for crimes like impaired driving. The problem arises when it comes to crimes involving violence, she said.\n\nThe OPP said they will still reveal the name, age and hometown of people involved in crimes.\n\nBut Leigh pointed out names don't always align with gender identity, which can lead to assumptions about gender. That's \"not in the spirit of actually addressing gender-diverse people, and being more inclusive,\" she said.\n\nThe change in policy was spurred by a review of the Police Services Act, the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act and the Ontario Human Rights Code, according to the OPP.\n\nThe OPP said they will continue to collect data on gender for their own statistics.\n\nAs recently as Monday, some OPP detachments in eastern Ontario were continuing to identify suspects' gender in news releases.\n\nMunicipal police services including those in Ottawa, Toronto and London continue to identify the gender of bost suspects and victims of crime.", "description": "The OPP's decision to stop publicly releasing the gender of people involved in crimes may have unintended consequences, a women's advocate is warning.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5295067.1569335528!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/erin-leigh.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
