Sara, of the band Tegan and Sara, had just told a story about the time in 12th grade when she hurled a chair at a classmate who\u2019d sneered during a health lesson, \u201cFags get AIDS.\u201d In her and her sister\u2019s new memoir, High School, Sara writes of \u201cthe dangerous sound\u201d of her own voice when she confronted the jerk, the \u201cspectacularly metallic\u201d crash of the chair into a desk, and her \u201cheaving sobs\u201d after she bolted from the classroom and hid in the drama department. The adults at the school called her to the principal\u2019s office but dealt with her gently. The adults who love her band, listening to her speak in 2019, treated her like a hero.\n\nAs she told this story, it had the air of a myth being born\u2014or rather, reborn. Teenagedom might be the phase of life most vividly signposted by pop culture, which has coughed up uncountable tales of bullies and outcasts, cheerleaders and quarterbacks, virginity anxieties and promposals, and so on. In John Hughes movies, and often in real life, teen rebellion stems from a blend of horniness and the quite-plausible fear of turning out like one\u2019s parents. For queer youths, though, angst isn\u2019t necessarily so ritualized. There\u2019s not been a huge library of mainstream work to guide their quest to form an identity, and they may be particularly baffled by dating rituals shaped by the imperative to one day marry and have kids. Lacking models of what their journey should look like only heightens the shock of realizing\u2014and of potentially being ostracized for\u2014one\u2019s difference.\n\nA recent boom in queer coming-of-age works has begun to address this problem, and Tegan and Sara\u2019s emotionally acute pop-rock has been helping out for two decades. Now the 39-year-old Calgary twins fling open their teenage yearbooks for public consumption. In the new memoir High School, they trade off terse, reflective chapters about their adolescence. On their new album, Hey, I\u2019m Just Like You, they rerecord songs they first wrote as teens. On their current tour, they read from the book, play from the album, and screen old home footage\u2014much of it shot in a perfectly \u201990s bedroom festooned with Smashing Pumpkins posters and a novelty gumball machine.", "description": "By revisiting their teen years, the rock duo\u2019s new memoir, High School, and album, Hey, I\u2019m Just Like You, dismantle cultural clich\u00e9s about adolescence.", "authors": ["Spencer Kornhaber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/TNS_guitar/facebook.jpg?1569863692", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
