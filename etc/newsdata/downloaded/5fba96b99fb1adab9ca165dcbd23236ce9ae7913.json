Both aces rested as the teams split in D.C., setting up a finale in the shadows (first pitch: 5:37 p.m. P.S.T., televised by TBS).\n\nThe winner will meet the Atlanta Braves or the St. Louis Cardinals in the best-of-seven N.L. Championship Series starting Friday. The Dodgers, who had the N.L.\u2019s best record at 106-56, will host Game 1 if they advance.\n\nStrasburg has given up one run in nine innings this October, with 14 strikeouts and no walks. Buehler has fired 13 shutout innings in his last two postseason starts, allowing only three hits. If he falters, Clayton Kershaw will be ready in relief.\n\n\u201cThe thing that\u2019s kind of lost in playoff baseball is that it\u2019s really fun,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cThe pressure and things like that, if you spin it in your head the right way, it can make it more fun.\u201d\n\nAs fun as baseball can be, it has also been cruel to the Dodgers and the Nationals, consistent winners in the regular season who always fall short in October. The Dodgers have the most victories in the majors across the last eight seasons, with 757. The Nationals rank second, with 730. Yet neither franchise has captured a championship in that time.", "description": "Wednesday: PG&E is cutting electricity for customers in Northern and Central California to prevent wildfires.
