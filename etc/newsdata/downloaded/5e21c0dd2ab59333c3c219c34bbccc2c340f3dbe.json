Farmers and plantation owners often resort to the cheapest way to clear land for new planting - by setting it alight.\n\nAs of 8am on 18 September 2019, there were 22,336 hotspots; 20,000 of which were in Sumatra and the province of Kalimantan, on Borneo island, according to a regional monitoring agency.\n\nHotspots are areas of intense heat detected by satellite, indicating a high chance of fire.\n\nIndonesia says some Malaysian companies operating in Indonesia are also to blame.\n\nCloud seeding uses a solution of water and sodium chloride, which is loaded into tanks on the back of the plane and then sprayed into clouds at altitude [Florence Looi/Al Jazeera]\n\nNone of this finger-pointing changes the fact that haze has become an almost annual occurrence around this time of the year. There seems to be little resolve to tackle it. In 2002, ASEAN countries signed an agreement to tackle transboundary haze. Seventeen years later, it is still a problem.\n\nCloud seeding is a desperate attempt to reduce the haze, but it is only a temporary solution.\n\n\"As long as there are still hotspots, and the winds continue to blow from those hotspots to this region, the haze will return,\" Jailan Bin Simon, director general of the Malaysian Meteorology Department tells us.\"But at least we'll be able to temporarily reduce the air pollutant index.\"\n\nWe went up in a C-130 plane as it sprayed a mixture of sodium chloride and water into the clouds. This is how cloud seeding works - the little water that is already in the air condenses around the newly-introduced particles. That helps thicken the clouds and increases the chance of rain.\n\nThe liquid solution is kept in 1,000-litre tanks, released through a tap at the bottom of each tank. The liquid flows from pipes to hoses that jut out of the back of the plane's open cargo door while the pilot flies the plane into the clouds.\n\nCloud seeding only works when there is enough cloud cover to produce rain. We were warned it may take some time to locate suitable clouds, even with weather guidance from meteorologists.\n\nWithin 20 minutes of the flight, the first of four tanks was released.\n\nFirefighters try to extinguish forest fires in Pekanbaru on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The fires spread health-damaging haze across the country and into neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore [Uncredited/AP Photo]\n\nTwo and a half hours later, the plane arrived back at the airbase, 25km from Kuala Lumpur city centre. I still was not sure whether the cloud seeding had been successful.\n\nThen my phone beeped with text messages.\n\n\"Looks like cloud seeding worked.\n\n\"P****** it down hard here\", accompanied by photos of a rain-soaked Kuala Lumpur.\n\nBut the respite was only temporary.\n\nA few hours later, the city was once again shrouded in haze.\n\nSchools have been given standing instructions to close when the air pollutant index reads above 200. NGOs have taken to distributing free masks to people.\n\nNGOs in Malaysia have been distributing face masks amid persistent haze [Mercy Malaysia/Al Jazeera]\n\nThose with existing health conditions suffer the most.\n\nEight-year-old Adam Ilhan bin Muhamad Syakiran, who has asthma and nephrotic syndrome, has had to skip school and spend more time indoors.\n\nOn one particularly bad day, he had to visit the doctor four times to use a nebuliser.\n\nHis mother, Munirah Mohd Izam, worries about his health.\n\n\"He's bored as well,\" she said. \"He keeps complaining about wanting to go back to school and meeting his friends.\n\n\"I think if this haze situation does not go away, it's going to be quite a stressful time for us as a family.\"\n\nThe monsoon rains are not due to start until next month, so there is little chance that the smoke will go away unless the fires ravaging parts of Indonesia are extinguished.\n\nUntil then, people will be hoping for a change in the wind direction.", "description": "The choking smog, blamed on forest fires in Indonesia, has become an annual occurrence in Southeast Asia, despite efforts to address the problem.", "authors": ["Florence Looi", "About The Author"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/18/06b9fdc44c334fffa9d07c90bbe06349_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
