They also promised to allow more Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO) to enter the market.\n\nMVNOs lease wireless capacity at wholesale prices and resell it at reduced retail prices.\n\nThat idea alarms the telecommunications firms, which say the MVNOs are not required to make any of the major investments needed to ensure cellphone service in what is a huge, thinly populated country.\n\nReuters reported in August that the Liberals would move to cut cellphone bills and make it easier for MVNOs to operate.\n\nThe big companies say some wireless rates decreased 35% from 2016 to 2018 and note they all introduced unlimited plans this year.\n\nThe Liberals said that if they did not see prices coming down in two years\u2019 time, they would consider lowering the entry and investment threshold for MVNOs.\n\nThey also said they could strengthen the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) - which regulates the industry - to allow it to make affordable\n\npricing for consumers a core objective.\n\nThe Liberals also want to change the way the government auctions off spectrum needed for wireless services.\n\nAccess to spectrum is awarded to the highest bidders, but a re-elected Liberal government would focus on consumer choice,\n\naffordability and broad access.\n\nThe Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association industry group was not immediately available for comment.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised on Sunday to reduce cellphone bills by 25% if his Liberals are re-elected next month and warned major providers he could force them to take action.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
