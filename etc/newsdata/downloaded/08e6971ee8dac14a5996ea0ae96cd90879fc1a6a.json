Attackers can press the Mute button very quickly and avoid a long ring that may alert victims.\n\nYou can send the signal quickly, so it doesn\u2019t have to ring for very long \u2014 Natalie Silvanovich (@natashenka) October 4, 2019\n\nThe Signal app supports end-to-end encrypted communications and is a favorite among journalists, political figures, dissidents, businesspeople, security researchers, and many other high-profile figures.\n\nBeing able to spy on any of these figures could be an advantage for many types of threat actor groups, from nation-state actors to cyber-criminals.\n\nSilvanovich said the bug was fixed today. Signal for Android version 4.48.13 was released earlier on GitHub, but this release doesn't appear to have reached the Google Play Store, where the last update dates back to September 28, 2019.", "description": "Signal bug lets attackers place and then auto-answer a call by pressing the Mute button.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/02/23/aeac0734-7ab8-49a7-88d0-5ecc90ac73fe/thumbnail/770x578/246302439a32a6d56c2356c7d37a5c8e/signal-new.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
