In fact with an average rate of around \u00a320 a day you\u2019re spending \u00a3200 when you leave your car at an airport like Gatwick for a 10-day break.\n\nBut one entrepreneur is trying to change all that with Car & Away, a peer-to-peer car rental provider. Andy Hibbert, founder and CEO of Car & Away describes his offering as the 'Airbnb of cars' and plans to disrupt the car hire sector by taking on stalwarts Hertz and Avis.\n\nHe points out that the concept of private car ownership is broken because cars just sit idle: \u2018The average UK car is used just four per cent of the time, at an annual cost to the owner of \u00a35,000 \u2013 it\u2019s a painfully inefficient model that our peer-to-peer car sharing service is designed to fundamentally overhaul.'\n\nCar owners can make between \u00a380 to \u00a3200 a week through Car & Away depending on the make, model and condition of their cars\n\nWith this business model there\u2019s no need for Andy to buy his own fleet of cars to hire out and add to the world's rapidly increasing stock of one billion cars.\n\nConvinced that there is a smarter way to own and rent cars he went about building a peer-to-peer car sharing community. The business model means he simply capitalises on assets that already exist.\n\nHe was aware that the car rental industry suffers a bad reputation, particularly when it comes to service, extra fees and hidden costs.\n\nAndy says: \u2018There are hidden charges to car rental. You can see a booked price but by the time you get to the counter the price triples. Simple stuff like an extra driver or satnav will cost extra.\n\n\u2018The biggest scam is the insurance with the excess waiver which typically maxes out your credit card which you need for your holiday.\n\n\u2018We have a deposit which is \u00a3250 \u2013 we block that on the card to cover for congestion charges, speeding fines and damage. We make sure you get the exact car you book and not \u201csimilar\".\n\n\u2018Our service means car renters finally have an alternative to expensive, poor service rental options while owners can earn some cash at the times when they genuinely have no use for their vehicle.\u2019\n\nAndy Hibbert is the founder and CEO of Car & Away which launched with a collaboration with Gatwick Airport back in 2017\n\nMaking money while on the beach\n\nCar owners using the scheme get to take 60 per cent of the earnings from the booking. Currently, Car & Away is offered at Gatwick and Bristol airports so car owners can make money when they go away on holiday from these bases.\n\nHowever, there are plans afoot to expand the business to the rest of the UK as well as overseas to service renters and owners at the likes of Holland's Schiphol Airport.\n\nCar & Away, meanwhile, take 40 per cent commission including VAT. A flat fee of \u00a339.99 is also charged to the car owner but there are some free extras. A valet is thrown in so the car owner comes back from their holiday to a shiny, clean car.\n\nAndy explains: \u2018You will get a free car wash if it\u2019s not rented and sweets for the kids, so it\u2019s a great experience.'\n\nDo I pay tax on my car rental income? Yes you do. Car & Away advise that you may be able to offset some of your vehicle\u2019s running costs against the income in generates. The amount of tax you pay will all depend on your own tax status and the company recommends you take advice from a professional to determine what you need to pay to the HMRC. Andy adds: \u2018As far as we\u2019re aware the UK government is pioneering the shared economy as the first \u00a31,000 earned in a year is tax free. 'So when your rental income goes over that you have to include it in your tax return. 'We create a statement of annual earnings to support tax returns. It will be easy to track.\u2019\n\nOwners can make around \u00a380-\u00a3200 a week depending on the size and make of the car.\n\nAndy says that, \u2018We send a statement and the cash is in the bank the day after it comes out of our service.'\n\nIt is Car & Away that sets the rental price and not the car owner.\n\nThe company says that it bases this on using market and seasonality plus the vehicles make, model, features and condition.\n\nAndy says: 'Smaller cars such as a Fiesta or Polo can get you up to \u00a380 a week while larger SUVs can earn you up to \u00a3200 a week.\n\n'Premium carriers and cars such as Volvos, Range Rovers, Audis and Mercs tend to get more money for owners.'\n\nCar owners can, however, set limits on mileage done per day. It can either be set as unlimited or Car & Away recommends a limit of 250 miles per day.\n\nThe model, explains Hibbert, creates winners on all sides. Besides the car owners benefiting, airports can make extra cash too as it allows them to re-sell car parking spaces at peak times.\n\nWhat happens if there\u2019s an accident?\n\nCar & Away does offer comprehensive insurance in the event of an accident under an Allianz policy which covers the replacement value of a vehicle up to the value of \u00a350,000. It works in parallel with car owners\u2019 existing policies but any claims made during the rental period are made to Car & Away\u2019s policy.\n\nAndy explains: \u2018We will fix everything. We have great partners behind the scene. RAC is for recovery. They will fix cars on the roadside and fix 90 per cent of cars.\n\nCar & Away are not the only peer-to-peer car lender in the UK. Andre Haddad, the CEO of Turo, says his company is the world's biggest peer-to-peer car sharing company (see below)\n\n\u2018If it needs a bigger repair we\u2019ll work with owner to get that done and sorted. In the event that there is a damage and need to be repaired and this hasn\u2019t happened yet, we will give owner a courtesy car for as long as they need it.\n\n\u2018Car owners will get an equivalent car to what they have. They won\u2019t, for example, get a small car if they have an SUV.\u2019\n\nCar & Away achieves \u00a33.5m in funding\n\nCar & Away launched in collaboration with London Gatwick Airport in 2017 and recently opened its Bristol service. In July it announced that it has raised \u00a33.5million in investment.\n\nAndy says the funding round will allow Car & Away to develop a pioneering instant-book car-sharing platform, enabling any car owner to rent out their vehicle from their home or parking whenever it is not being used with use of keyless technology.\n\nWhich cars qualify for Car & Away? 1. Your car has to be nine years old or younger 2. It must have less than 100,000 miles on the clock 3. It must be comprehensively insured in the UK 4. It may not be a company car UK registered vehicle 5. The replacement value of the car must be no more than \u00a350k 6. The car must not have had any custom modifications 7. The expiry date of vehicle tax and MOT must be more than 30 days away\n\nAndy explains that the tech will enable any car owner to rent out their car at any time. If the car is parked at train station car parks the rental income itself could fund the parking as well as the commute of the owner. However, this part of the service is not available yet.\n\nBut with the latest funding round it appears the business has the funds to develop this part of the service. The tech needed to develop the business further costs \u00a3750,000.\n\nAndy says this will be used to build apps, front end and integrating technology in cars and building a scalable platform. It will also be used to fund its airport infrastructure.\n\nHe adds: \u2018It gives us time to run the business for up to two years when it would need the next investment to further our growth. We want to be the leader in peer to peer car sharing.\u2019\n\nThe company says that rentals from official airport parking have grown by 35 per cent, while vehicle supply has grown by 30 per cent a month.\n\nAndy says that when the \u2018At Home\u2019 model launches car owners could earn around \u00a3700 per month from joining the venture.\n\nHe explains the model hasn\u2019t taken off for others because of certain barriers. \u2018Car & Away will install keyless technology into the car. This is very important because without keyless technology, someone needs to be there to hand over the keys in person.\n\n\u2018That means if the owner is not available at the times the car could be rented out, renting a car won't be possible. This is a barrier to car sharing as for owners who work in offices etc., being there in person is obviously not an option.\n\n\u2018Car & Away need to install the keyless technology so that we take this friction away and build Europe\u2019s first \u201con demand\u201d peer to peer car sharing platform.\n\n'On demand means if it\u2019s available you can search for it, find it and book it instantly - walk up to the car and unlock it and start it without needing the owner to be there.\n\n\u2018At home - the idea is that the car will rent multiple times, up to 50 per year, so every weekend for some people, and they could earn up to \u00a3700 per month doing so.\u2019", "description": "Owning a car can set you back at least \u00a35k a year but one entrepreneur wants to change all that by making it possible for people to rent out their cars while away at work or on holiday", "authors": ["Angelique Ruzicka For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
