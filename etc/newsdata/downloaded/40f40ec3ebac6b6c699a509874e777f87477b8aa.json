But it means Johnson he has to ask the EU to delay Britain\u2019s departure, since Parliament previously passed a law compelling him to do that if a Brexit divorce deal had not been passed by Saturday.\n\nThe government still hopes it can pass the needed legislation by the end of the month so the U.K. can leave on time.\n\nA defiant Johnson said after the vote that he was not \u201cdaunted or dismayed\u201d by the result and would push ahead with plans to leave the EU. Johnson said he would not \u201cnegotiate\u201d with the EU for a delay.\n\nFor its part, the European Union gave no indication it was in a hurry to grant an extension.\n\n\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 @EU_Commission takes note of the vote in the House of Commons today on the so-called #Letwin Amendment meaning that the #WithdrawalAgreement itself was not put to vote today. It will be for the UK government to inform us about the next steps as soon as possible. \u2014 Mina Andreeva (@Mina_Andreeva) October 19, 2019\n\nAs lawmakers debated, tens of thousands of anti-Brexit demonstrators descended on London to march to Parliament Square, demanding a new referendum on whether Britain should leave the EU or remain. Protesters, many wearing blue berets emblazoned with yellow stars symbolizing the EU flag, poured out of subway trains and buses for the last-ditch protest effort. Read more on the protests\n\nThe amendment makes support for the deal conditional on the legislation to implement it being passed by Parliament, something that could take several days or weeks. It also gives lawmakers another chance to scrutinize \u2014 and possibly change\u2014 the Brexit departure terms while the legislation is passing through Parliament.\n\nJohnson called any delay to Britain\u2019s Brexit departure date \u201cpointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust.\u201d\n\nAnd he warned Saturday that the bloc\u2019s approval could not be guaranteed.\n\n\u201cThere is very little appetite among our friends in the EU for this business to be protracted by one extra day,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey have had three and a half years of this debate.\u201d\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron made the same point a day earlier in Brussels.\n\n\u201cI want us to finish this off and speak about the future,\u201d Macron said. \u201cThe Oct. 31 date must be respected. I don\u2019t believe new delays should be granted.\u201d\n\nThe EU\u2019s budget commissioner, Guenther Oettinger, told Germany\u2019s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that if British lawmakers reject Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, the U.K. is likely to crash out of the bloc with no deal.\n\nBritain could still leave the EU on Oct. 31, if Parliament approves the legislation \u2014 the Withdrawal Agreement Bill \u2014 in time. The government plans to introduce the bill early next week and could hold late-night sittings of Parliament in hope of getting it passed within days.\n\nAs lawmakers thundered on in their first Saturday sitting since the 1982 Falklands War, the streets of London turned into a sea of blue. Some demonstrators with bells strapped to their legs and wielding sticks performed a traditional morris dance and chanted: \u201cMorris, not Boris!\u201d to cheers from onlookers.\n\nJohnson\u2019s hopes of getting the deal through Parliament were dealt a blow when his Northern Ireland ally, the Democratic Unionist Party, said it would not back him. The party says Johnson\u2019s Brexit package \u2014 which carves out special status for Northern Ireland to keep an open border with EU member Ireland \u2014 is bad for the region and weakens its bonds with the rest of the U.K.\n\nThe DUP on Saturday voted for the delay, and one of its MPs told the BBC it would vote against \u2014 rather than abstain \u2014 Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement.\n\nTo make up for the votes of 10 DUP lawmakers, Johnson has tried to persuade members of the left-of-center Labour Party to support the deal. Late Friday the government promised to bolster protections for the environment and workers\u2019 rights to allay Labour fears that the Conservative government plans to slash those protections after Brexit.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed those promises as inadequate.\n\n\u201cThis deal is not good for jobs, damaging for industry and a threat to our environment and natural world,\u201d he said. \u201cSupporting the government this afternoon would merely fire the starting pistol in a race to the bottom in regulations and standards.\u201d\n\nThe British pound GBPUSD, -0.0231% traded at $1.2975 on Friday night, an indication financial markets expect the U.K. won\u2019t leave the European Union without a deal.", "description": "British lawmakers have voted to postpone a decision on whether to back a Brexit deal with the European Union, throwing a wrench into government plans to...", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "Associated Press", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT648_johnso_ZG_20191019081640.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
