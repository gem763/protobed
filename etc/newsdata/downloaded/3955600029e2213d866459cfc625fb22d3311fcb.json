Two-loss teams are mostly done; one-loss teams are on the brink; undefeated teams can dare to dream. With two weeks until the first CFP rankings are revealed, it\u2019s time to consider the possibilities that would be the most appalling to the most people.\n\nAcrimonious Scenario One: Alabama gets a Tua Mulligan (11) and the SEC gets two bids (12).\n\nHow it could happen: Tua Tagovailoa is trying to come back by Nov. 9 from an ankle procedure performed Sunday. It could happen, but how close will he be to 100 percent? And what if he\u2019s not 100 percent, and the Crimson Tide loses a close one to LSU? And LSU rolls to the SEC championship at 13-0, and \u2018Bama bounces back with a more healthy Tua to finish a strong 12-1?\n\nThen both the Tigers and the Crimson Tide get in, and everyone else is fuming.\n\nThen we get to go back through the endless caterwauling about how a team can\u2019t even win its own division or conference, yet still compete for the national championship. And then everyone gets to charge the committee and ESPN and the rest of the national media with being in the bag for the SEC. And then it\u2019s time to revisit eight league games vs. nine, and not playing enough non-conference games outside the South, and every other annual lament that is lobbed in the direction of the league that tends to play the best football more often than not.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd if you want to take all that fan outrage and turn it to 11, go ahead and make the team getting the benefit of the doubt Alabama \u2014 for the third time in less than a decade. In 2011, during the BCS Era, the Crimson Tide lost to LSU in Tuscaloosa during the regular season, did not win the SEC, but got the nod over one-loss Oklahoma State and one-loss Stanford for a rematch with LSU \u2014 which \u2018Bama won handily. And in 2017, Alabama got in after losing its regular-season finale to Auburn, edging out Ohio State for the final bid \u2014 then the Tide won it all over fellow SEC school Georgia.\n\nIf you give Nick Saban a chance, good luck.\n\nAlabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa (13) walks off the field hurt against Tennessee on Saturday. (AP)\n\nAcrimonious Scenario Two: Notre Dame (13) gets in, with the help of Jim Harbaugh (14). If there is anything a large swath of America wants to see less than an Alabama backdoor bid for its sixth straight playoff appearance, it might be the Fighting Irish making the playoff for the second straight year \u2014 with Coach Khaki clearing the way. It\u2019s not likely, but here\u2019s how it could go down:\n\nHow it could happen: The Fighting Irish, currently 5-1, obviously would need to win out and get to 11-1. That would include a victory over Michigan in the Big House on Saturday. Then the Irish would need the Wolverines to storm through November on their way to 10-2, most notably beating Ohio State at season\u2019s end.\n\nThrow in a USC Pac-12 South championship at 9-3, maybe a Pac-12 overall title at 10-3. That would give Notre Dame a second quality win.\n\nMeanwhile, Georgia \u2014 which handed Notre Dame its lone loss \u2014 would need to revive itself and finish strong with wins over Florida (Nov. 2) and Auburn (Nov. 16) to capture the SEC East. A victory in the SEC championship game wouldn\u2019t hurt, either.\n\nThat confluence of events would considerably beef up the Irish strength of schedule, perhaps sufficiently to compete with other one-loss teams. Anyone think conference affiliation and 13th data points might come up a time or two?\n\nAcrimonious Scenario Three: The Pac-12 (15) wanders in under cover of darkness.\n\nHow it could happen: The Power Five league everyone loves to rip might have a better shot at this than you think. If one-loss Oregon meets one-loss Utah in the Pac-12 title game, that\u2019s potentially a matchup of Top 10 teams. The better scenario from there would be a Ducks victory, because they would have a win over the USC team that defeated the Utes, plus victories at Washington and Arizona State.\n\nThen it would certainly help Oregon\u2019s cause if Auburn navigates its closing gauntlet of LSU, Georgia and Alabama with two or more victories. The Ducks\u2019 lone loss was to the Tigers, on the opening weekend, in a game Oregon led for nearly 55 of the 60 minutes. Some chaos elsewhere wouldn\u2019t hurt, either.\n\nAcrimonious Scenario Four: Cincinnati (16), anyone?\n\nHow it could happen: The hard way. But let\u2019s tease it out. The Bearcats (6-1) would need to win out, that\u2019s a given. That could include defeating one-loss Memphis on the road to end the regular season and then beating undefeated SMU in the American Athletic title game. Cincinnati is already ranked in the top 20, and it would theoretically keep moving up toward the Top 10 over the next six weeks.\n\nThe outside assistance would have to come in the following form: Ohio State would have to continue devastating everything in its path, thus making the Bearcats\u2019 42-0 loss in Columbus look less emasculating. A UCLA run out west would be vital \u2014 believe it or not, at 2-2 in the Pac-12, the Bruins still have a shot at the South Division title.\n\nWidespread destruction elsewhere in the Power Five would have to occur. And even if it did, there would be one major hurdle to a 12-1 Cincinnati team with a loss to Ohio State getting a shot: The Bearcats almost certainly would be the No. 4 seed, and the Buckeyes probably would be the No. 1 seed, and ESPN execs would have aneurysms if the committee tried to sell them on a rematch of a six-touchdown game in September.\n\nTHE ADDRESSES WHERE THE SEASON WILL BE DECIDED\n\nFour campus locations will host multiple games that, as of today, will have major playoff implications. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n\nOhio Stadium (17): 411 Woody Hayes Drive, Columbus, Ohio. Capacity: 110,944. Opened: 1922. The big games: Wisconsin-Ohio State on Saturday, although that one lost some massive luster when the Badgers were shocked by Illinois; Penn State-Ohio State on Nov. 23. The home team has won 17 straight games there, and it\u2019s been a long time since the home team looked as good as it does currently.\n\nJordan-Hare Stadium (18): 251 South Donahue Drive, Auburn, Alabama. Capacity: 92,542. Opened: 1939. The big games: Georgia-Auburn, Nov. 16; Alabama-Auburn, Nov. 30. One or more of these three teams has played in the BCS championship or College Football Playoff 10 straight years. There is a legitimate chance it will be 11 straight this season.\n\nTCF Bank Stadium (19): 420 SE 23rd Avenue, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Capacity: 50,805. Opened: 2009. The big games; Penn State-Minnesota, Nov. 9; Wisconsin-Minnesota, Nov. 30. The absolute least likely stadium on this list. But with the Gophers 7-0 and only a home game against Maryland standing between them and the collision with the Nittany Lions, the highly improbable is close to becoming real. And the mind reels at the premise of Minnesota being 11-0 when the Badgers visit for the Paul Bunyan Axe game. If that comes to pass and the game isn\u2019t played in a blizzard, The Dash will be outraged.\n\nMichigan Stadium (20): 1201 South Main Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Capacity: 107,601. Opened: 1927. The big games: Notre Dame-Michigan on Saturday; Ohio State-Michigan on Nov. 30. Harbaugh is 28-4 in the Big House, but the four losses were all big ones \u2014 twice to the Buckeyes, twice to Michigan State. His \u201cFinest Hour\u201d prediction didn\u2019t quite work out at Penn State on Saturday, but he\u2019s got a couple more opportunities for the elusive statement win on home turf.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "With two weeks until the first CFP rankings are revealed, it\u2019s time to consider the possibilities that would be the most appalling to the most people.", "authors": ["Pat Forde"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OCxIvfnmFLx5wyOLqBXnAw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F7Jqneo7_MPP03ohcoxXrA--~B/aD0yNjA5O3c9MzkxMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a7812be0-f3c8-11e9-bcfb-cc77cdc44e14", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
