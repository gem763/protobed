He hadn\u2019t had a great time at Utd, but I feel Mourinho played a big part in that and this could have been a fresh season for him.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s not a player that had to prove himself, everyone is aware what he can deliver when firing on all cylinders.\n\n\u2018In these situations, you need to have your experienced players in the changing room and Utd have lost two big figures in Sanchez and Lukaku, without replacing them.\u2019\n\nWinning just two of their seven league fixtures so far this season, Manchester United find themselves tenth in the Premier League ahead of this weekend\u2019s round of fixtures.\n\nThe Red Devils have made a poor start to the season (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe Red Devils face Liverpool later in the month and Murphy says Solskjaer could be in \u2018a lot of trouble\u2019 if his United team are rolled over by the Premier League leaders.\n\n\u2018Solskjaer could be in a lot of trouble if Utd take a serious beating from Liverpool after the international break,\u2019 Murphy added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Every player and member of staff is in the spotlight and every decision and action is being judged. It doesn\u2019t matter who Utd play now, every game is as big as the next.\n\n\u2018Man Utd need every player fit if they\u2019re to stand a chance of getting some consistency back. Without Pogba, Martial and Rashford all playing at the same time, they look very average.\n\n\u2018The Liverpool game will shine a light on how much these players really want to turn the club around.\n\n\u2018Playing Liverpool isn\u2019t just about the 3 points, it\u2019s getting one over your rivals and making a statement.\u2019\n\nMORE: Frank Lampard explains why he has made Jorginho Chelsea\u2019s new vice-captain", "description": "Danny Murphy says Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Manchester United made a 'big mistake' when they let Alexis Sanchez leave in the summer.
