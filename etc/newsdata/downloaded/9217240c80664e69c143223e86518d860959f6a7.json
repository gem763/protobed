A sensible prime minister would cut his losses after being found guilty of unlawfully suspending parliament. But Johnson may go deeper into the heart of darkness as he tries to make good on his pledge to leave the EU \u201cdo or die\u201d on October 31.\n\nSo it is good news that Jeremy Corbyn is not falling into the trap of holding an immediate vote of no confidence in the prime minister. That could trigger a general election \u2013 and, by the time we knew the result, we would be in November. And unless Johnson asked the EU to delay Brexit, we would have crashed out.\n\nThe attorney general Geoffrey Cox said today that \u201cthis parliament is a dead parliament\u201d. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Parliament is alive and kicking \u2013 and has many things it can do to hold Johnson\u2019s feet to the fire. Here are five.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nStop the PM from wriggling out of the \u201cBenn\u201d Act\n\nThe Benn Act passed this month requires Johnson to ask the EU for three months\u2019 extra time if he hasn\u2019t got a deal by 19 October. Unfortunately, it has a few loopholes.\n\nOne is that the prime minister doesn\u2019t have to ask for a delay if MPs have already passed a resolution agreeing to leave with a deal (see 1(1)(a)). The snag is that to leave with a deal, parliament would also need to pass a law ratifying the agreement \u2013 not just pass a resolution. This government is so tricksy that it could go on strike if a resolution passed and refuse to push through the required law \u2013 with the result that we would crash out.\n\nAnother loophole would occur if Johnson asked for extra time and then did a deal. If MPs approved the deal, he could go back to the EU and withdraw his request for extra time \u2013 and again we\u2019d crash out. (See 1(5)).\n\nYet another weakness is that the Benn Act is silent on what happens if the prime minister refuses to ask for a delay. What if Johnson is prepared to go to prison rather than send the required letter? The courts may instruct somebody else to do so on his behalf. But, if not, we might be heading for the abyss.\n\nSo a top priority for Labour and the other opposition MPs is to pass emergency legislation closing these loopholes. To do so, they will need to grab control of the parliamentary timetable, probably next week.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A recess is not the same as a \u201cprorogation\u201d. MPs themselves decide on when to go into recess; prorogation, the power Johnson has just abused, is technically the Queen\u2019s decision as advised by the prime minister.\n\nWisely, the opposition looks like it will reject Johnson\u2019s request for a recess. This is not because of vindictiveness. It\u2019s because there\u2019s important business to be done in parliament \u2013 notably to tighten up the Benn Act.\n\nJohnson has made clear he wants another prorogation so that the Queen can reopen parliament on 14 October. A short suspension of four to six days, in advance of a Queen\u2019s Speech, wouldn\u2019t contravene yesterday\u2019s Supreme Court judgment. So it\u2019s quite possible that parliament will be suspended for the week of 7 October.\n\nThe risk is that, if parliament also doesn\u2019t sit for a couple of days next week because of a \u201crecess\u201d, MPs won\u2019t have enough time to pass emergency legislation. So they should say \u201cno thanks\u201d to another holiday.\n\nFind Johnson in contempt of parliament\n\nJust before parliament was unlawfully suspended, MPs passed a \u201chumble address\u201d to the Queen. This instructed the government to divulge messages that advisors, including Dominic Cummings, had been sending around in connection with parliament\u2019s prorogation. The government refused to provide this information.\n\nMPs could now pass a motion finding the prime minister and the government in contempt of parliament. It\u2019s not clear what, if any sanction, they would attach. But it would at the very least amount to a severe bollocking.\n\nWhat is the PM\u2019s Brexit proposal?\n\nLast week, the government sent three \u201cnon-papers\u201d to the EU setting out its proposal for a deal. It banned the EU from publishing these documents.\n\nMPs could pass a new humble address requiring the Johnson to divulge the proposals. That would give parliament the ability to examine whether they are any good. From what has already leaked, they look pretty weak. If the prime minister refused to publish them, he could again be held in contempt.\n\nEven if there\u2019s a deal, Brexit must be delayed\n\nIf the prime minister gets a deal at the European Council summit on 17 and 18 October, we\u2019ll still need extra time. The treaty wouldn\u2019t just need to be approved by our parliament. The European Parliament would have to ratify it too. The idea that everything can be wrapped up by October 31 seems fanciful.\n\nMPs could avoid this danger in several ways. The key should be to ensure that parliament doesn\u2019t consider any deal until the prime minister has already requested extra time.\n\nThese five things should limit the amount of monkey business Johnson can get up to over the next few weeks \u2013 and ensure Brexit is delayed. But MPs also need to be looking beyond October 31. What will they do then?\n\nCorbyn says he will want an election. But that isn\u2019t wise. It\u2019s not just that Labour isn\u2019t in great shape to fight an election as a result of its internal divisions. The issue of what happens with Brexit shouldn\u2019t be muddled up with the question over who should run the country. Far better to have a Final Say referendum first \u2013 and only then go for an election.\n\nHugo Dixon is chair of InFacts and deputy chair of People\u2019s Vote", "description": "After Boris Johnson\u2019s humiliating defeat in the Supreme Court, the opposition should hope for the best but prepare for the worst.
