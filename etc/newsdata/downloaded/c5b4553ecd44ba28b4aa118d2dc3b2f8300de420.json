In many ways you\u2019re looking at two different sports.\u201d\n\nThe words are spoken by Prav Mathema, the Welsh Rugby Union\u2019s longstanding head of medical services, but it\u2019s a picture anyone who has followed rugby union since it turned professional in 1995 recognises.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves. At this year\u2019s World Cup there will be five times more rucks every match than at the first World Cup in 1987, the average player weight will be two stone per man more, the ball will be in play for an average of 39 minutes; more than double the time it was.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Since 2011 the number of tackles made in a professional match has more than doubled with most teams now expecting to make at least 150 tackles per match. In the last two seasons alone the average number of tackles per match has risen by 33 per cent.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

(Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images) Getty Images\n\nAdd in the back-to-back nature of tournament rugby and it all adds up to an unprecedented, and some would argue intolerable, demand on players\u2019 bodies.\n\nMathema, among others, is charged with keeping the Welsh squad fit. It is something they failed to do at the last World Cup when Warren Gatland\u2019s battered and bruised squad crawled into the quarter final to face South Africa without 10 first-choice players. It was hardly a surprise they lost.\n\nMathema insists lessons have been learned and mistakes will not be repeated. \u201cWe were absolutely ravaged by injuries in 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them were unavoidable but some were definitely avoidable. We\u2019ve learned lessons.\n\n\u201cThose avoidable ones we have dissected and analysed. Those are the ones which much never happen again. We could have avoided them and we\u2019ve worked out how. Ultimately it comes down to load management.\u201d\n\nThe evidence appears to be on his side. In purely statistical terms, Wales had no right to win last year\u2019s Six Nations, let alone the Grand Slam. They scored just 10 tries in five matches \u2013 14 fewer than England \u2013 and made the least line breaks of any team. Their line-out success rate of 76.4 per cent was the worst of any team.\n\nBut with just one enforced change through injury in the entire tournament, Gatland was at a significant advantage over his rivals as Wales remained settled and cohesive throughout the tournament.\n\nMathema believes the secret lies in the centralisation of the WRU Global Positioning System (GPS) database which monitors players\u2019 workload across the four regions and enables him and his medical team to micromanage their top players\u2019 training schedules.\n\n\u201cBecause of the investment the WRU has made we\u2019ve been able to roll those GPS units across the game as a whole,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a uniformed system of monitoring and gives us a real advantage on that front. It allows us to manage performance and avoid real sharp spikes in load. Everything is visible.\n\n\u201cWe use GPS data every day to understand how fast someone is running, how intensely they are running, how many times they are accelerating. All those things are absolutely essential for us to prepare someone but also ensure we\u2019re not over or underloading someone because both will lead to injuries. It\u2019s about finding the middle ground. It\u2019s not always less is more.\n\n\u201cNo doubt other teams do the same but it\u2019s going to be more labour intensive for them because they don\u2019t manage it centrally.\u201d\n\nWith intensive training camps in Switzerland and Turkey under their belts, Wales players will head into the tournament in Japan believing they are the fittest in the world. They may well be right.\n\nThe manner in which old warhorse Alun Wyn Jones remained in peak condition throughout the Six Nations, and at the top of game, was testament alone to the work done behind the scenes by Mathema\u2019s strength and conditioning team.\n\nIn the final Ireland game alone \u2013 a match Eddie Jones alleged Wales players had looked \u201ctired\u201d in the build-up \u2013 their 33-year-old captain made 19 tackles, cleared out nine rucks and carried seven times.\n\n\u201cWe knew we weren\u2019t tired,\u201d Mathema said. \u201cWe knew our numbers and tapered player loads accordingly.\u201d\n\nMathema, formerly head of medical services at Queens Park Rangers and Wasps, is confident Wales\u2019 record low Six Nations injury rates can be repeated at the World Cup.\n\nAnd if Gatland can pick his first-choice side more often than not, who knows where that could lead?\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be in the wrong job if I didn\u2019t think we could win it,\u201d Mathema said. \u201cPhysically, I truly believe we can get there.\u201d\n\nMore than three decades since the first World Cup, rugby is a very different sport. Wales, under Mathema, have adapted accordingly.", "description": "\u201cAll the metrics have changed. In many ways you\u2019re looking at two different sports.\u201d The words are spoken by Prav Mathema, the Welsh Rugby Union\u2019s longstanding head of medical services, but it\u2019s a picture anyone who has followed rugby union since it turned professional in 1995 recognises.", "authors": ["Sam Peters"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/13/wales.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
