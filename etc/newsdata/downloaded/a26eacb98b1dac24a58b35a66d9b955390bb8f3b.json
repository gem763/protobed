It\u2019s the bureaucrat and the political elite that have gathered around Putin thanks to wars in Syria and eastern Ukraine.\n\nDemonstrators shouted \u201cPutin out\u201d.\n\nSome protesters also complained about migrants being allowed to enter Russia.", "description": "A monument to Grand Prince Vladimir has been erected near the Kremlin", "authors": ["Seamus Kearney"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/348752/1000x563_348752.jpg", "published_at": "2016-11-04"}
