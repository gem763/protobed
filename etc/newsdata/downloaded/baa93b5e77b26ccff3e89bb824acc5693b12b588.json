Yes, Donald Trump faces a storm of his own making\n\nUnder any previous president, Thursday's brazen comments would have been met with Republican outrage. President Barack Obama would have been inundated by calls for impeachment by Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mcconnell and congressional Republicans. President George W. Bush would have faced the ire of the conservative base. Yet all of these so-called principled people stand silent as the president sells the integrity of American elections to the foreign country with the best opposition research team.\n\nFor nearly three years, Republicans have dismissed this president\u2019s hateful, divisive rhetoric, his presidential incompetence and his constitutional ignorance as \u201cTrump being Trump,\u201d suggesting he is just a harmless guy from back home who got in a little over his head.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to the American republic, and his performance on the White House lawn Thursday morning was simply the latest example. And yet, Republicans stand silent.\n\nTime and again, they've neglected their duty\n\nIn fact, Republicans have gotten it wrong on this president in every way. They have stood silently by as Trump has stretched the Constitution to its limits. They have aided and abetted his racist assaults on Democrats in Congress and migrants at the border. They have defended his abuses of power and looked the other way as he has treated the presidency like a get-rich-quick scheme.\n\nBut it is on impeachment that congressional Republicans have most dramatically abandoned their oaths of office. Instead of treating the impeachment proceeding like the solemn constitutional procedure that it is, they have responded with cynical, predictable political spin, demeaning the Constitution and the American people in the process.\n\nImpeachment whine: Trump thinks Republicans weren't tough on Obama. Believe me, we were.\n\nThe response of Republican Party leaders over the past two weeks has been nothing short of stunning. When House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy was interviewed about the impeachment proceedings by \"60 Minutes\", he appeared to have not read the memo on the contents of the call with Ukrainian President Zelensky upon which the impeachment inquiries are based. Republicans in the House continue to repeat White House talking points about conspiracy theories and \u201cperfect\u201d phone calls. And Vice President Mike Pence reveals his own ethical deficiency when he joins calls for investigations of former Vice President Biden that he knows are based on false and discredited accusations.\n\nOur nation faces great peril today, not because foreign tyrants are attempting to influence our elections, but because the president is openly inviting them to.\n\nWe are in peril because of a delusional, unstable president who believes he should have unfettered power to do anything he chooses without accountability.\n\nBut most of all, we face great peril because the leaders of the Republican Party continue to empower this crooked, morally corrupt, unbalanced president.", "description": "Republicans continue to make excuse after excuse for Trump, even as the president makes his corruption a public affair.", "authors": ["Jennifer Horn", "Opinion Contributor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VwR9h2RlTL2NKh98i9gi0A--~B/aD0zMjEyO3c9NDgxODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_opinion_532/8074b429699f03e889a394273b30aedb", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
