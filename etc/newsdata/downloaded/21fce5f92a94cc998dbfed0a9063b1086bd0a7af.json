Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a member of the House Oversight Committee, who called for an impeachment inquiry after special counsel Robert Mueller finished his investigation into whether Trump associates worked with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. \"How do you take an oath to protect the Constitution ... and then ignore obstruction of justice by the president?\"\n\nEverything \u2014 even obstructing an investigation \u2014 could be used against Trump in the case for removing him from office for what the Constitution describes as the ambiguous \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\" lawmakers and impeachment experts say.\n\n\u201cIf you are just looking at Ukraine, there are significant crimes and wrongdoing that are left on the table,\u201d said Aaron Scherb, director of legislative affairs at Common Cause, an advocacy group that works closely with staff of House committees.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

One lawmaker told POLITICO that even if she focuses on Ukraine, she would quietly allow a couple other issues to be included in the impeachment inquiry, likely including obstruction of justice in the Russia investigation.\n\nLast week, she directed six House committees \u2014 Justice, Oversight, Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, Ways and Means, and Financial Services \u2014 to continue their investigations as part of an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe broader inquiry will emphasize abuse of power generally,\u201d said Corey Brettschneider, a Brown University professor who wrote the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Oath and the Office: A Guide to the Constitution for Future Presidents.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of these episodes illustrate a failure to respect the office and protect the Constitution,\u201d Brettschneider said.\n\nThe committees, which are looking into everything from Trump\u2019s finances to his communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin, are being asked to send relevant information to the Judiciary Committee for what is expected to be a formal vote.\n\n\u201cThe key is for the House to define the scope of any impeachment inquiry,\u201d said Ross Garber, a lawyer who defended four governors facing impeachment. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s unclear what the issues are or which committees are responsible for which issues.\u201d\n\nTrump admitted he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into whether former Vice President Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire a prosecutor who investigated Biden\u2019s son\u2019s company, but he insisted there was nothing wrong with what he did.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/a6/b0/0b72d32e43148a67e77a39ab08ef/trump.png\"\n\nHe is defending himself in much the same way he did during the two-year investigation into whether he and his aides colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 elections \u2014 attacking the Democrats, the media and his critics.\n\n\u201cWhat they've done to this country is a disgrace,\u201d he said last week. \u201cThey've hurt this country very badly. And no other president should have to go through what I've gone through.\u201d\n\nTrump has released documents related to his contacts with Zelensky, saying he wants to be transparent in the investigation, leading some to speculate that he, too, would like to keep the House focussed just on Ukraine.\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to ignore other requests and subpoenas despite the impeachment label, according to several people familiar with the White House plans, meaning the two sides may end up in court. But the Democrats could use those setbacks to their advantage.\n\n\u201cThe White House refusing to comply with subpoenas can be used toward an impeachment charge,\u201d said Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor who has written books on impeachment and testified before Congress on the topic.\n\nHouse Democrats have launched dozens of investigations, but the allegations garnering the most attention for impeachment involve Trump violating the so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution by allowing federal employees and service members, and foreign officials to stay at Trump resorts; paying $280,000 to silence former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult-film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign to cover up his sexual encounters; and trying to thwart special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference.\n\nBut Trump also faces allegations that he inflated and deflated the value of assets to acquire loans and pay less in taxes and that he allowed top aides, including son-in-law Jared Kushner, to receive security clearances they were not qualified to have.\n\nRepublicans insist the House needs to vote on impeachment before Democrats have any additional powers. But many experts say that\u2019s not necessary.\n\nRep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, argued Pelosi\u2019s announcement on impeachment last week didn\u2019t change anything legally. \u201cThere has been no House vote to authorize a formal impeachment inquiry,\u201d he said.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nA study on impeachment by the Congressional Research Service doesn\u2019t indicate a vote is needed, according to Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project On Government Oversight.\n\nBut Garber said a House vote could help a judge decide whether Trump\u2019s assertions of executive privilege outweigh the interests of the House.\n\n\u201cIn both Nixon and Clinton [impeachments] the House formally endorsed impeachment inquiries and granted subpoena authority to committees for purposes of conducting those inquiries,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has not happened here. A court could, therefore, easily conclude that the statements of the speaker do not convert the inquiries that had been underway into impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders suggested the impeachment inquiry might be more effective if it\u2019s narrowed, because the Ukraine call is an issue that has resonated with the American public and lawmakers. The House could lose support, especially with some moderate lawmakers, if it expands to other investigations, they say.\n\nConnolly said he understands why some colleagues want to narrow the focus and said he\u2018s \u201ctorn\u201d about how the House should proceed on impeachment.\n\n\u201cDo you go forward with your best case that\u2019s the clearest and most compelling, so that we try to keep the country as united as possible as we undertake impeachment of the president?\u201c he asked. \u201cOr do you go and lay out all of the case with the understanding some of them are not going to carry majority support and will be picked apart and can distract and are hard to follow sometimes?\u201d\n\nDemocratic Rep. Dan Kildee, who has supported impeachment for months, told reporters last week that most members don\u2019t want to exclude what he called egregious violations.\n\n\u201cIt may be that if push comes to shove, and we do have multiple articles, that not all of them will get the same level of support,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe some will, maybe some won't pass.\u201d\n\nThe House has not set a deadline for impeachment, but some lawmakers want articles of impeachment to be considered by the end of the year.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/15/3f/769e4b1049909c1fb0f7de0cf06a/190930-connolly-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
