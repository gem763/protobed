She hanged herself in her garage but survived.\n\nNow, Taryn le Roux (40) from Johannesburg says there\u2019s a reason she survived.\n\nIn March 2017 she\u2019d fetched a rope. While she was tying it to the beams in her garage, her neighbour walked past. At first, he thought she was making a clothesline.\n\n\u201cWe greeted each other and he kept walking but later he told me something hadn\u2019t felt right to him. A while later he came back and found me hanging there,\u201d Taryn tells YOU.\n\nHe took her down and performed CPR until an ambulance arrived.\n\n\u201cThey told my mom I wasn\u2019t going to make it. I spent a week in a coma. But that [surviving] didn\u2019t mean a sudden turnaround in my life,\u201d she says.\n\nTaryn had had a drinking problem for years. She says she used to be \u201cone of the boys\u201d and refused to admit that she was drinking too much. But a few nights a week spent partying became an out-of-control problem.\n\nIn the months leading up to her suicide attempt, she\u2019d spend night after night alone in bars, drinking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s much about those nights I can\u2019t remember at all. It\u2019s a blank,\u201d she says.\n\nShe agreed to start attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and for a while it looked as if things were improving.\n\n\u201cI was clean for six months before that day [of the suicide attempt] but then I relapsed. And it was horrific. They say a relapse is a horrible thing and it\u2019s true. It was such a low point that I didn\u2019t see a way out of it ever.\u201d\n\nTaryn has been married and divorced twice. She says she was abused as a child and suffered from bouts of deep depression throughout her life.\n\n\u201cI made bad choices and at one point I was cutting myself too.\u201d\n\nShe has a son, now 11, who\u2019d been bitterly angry at her after her suicide attempt.\n\nIt\u2019s been a struggle to get out of the deep hole of depression she was in, Taryn says.\n\n\u201cFor a year, my depression was so bad that I just stayed in bed. I slept all day but my mom kept insisting I get treatment for my alcoholism.\u201d\n\nShe started going to AA meetings and gradually she got out of the house more and no longer slept the days away.\n\n\u201cAA became like family. They saved my life and I could look to the future again.\n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m starting my own cosmetics company. I want to instil self-confidence in women and make them feel beautiful. It\u2019s always been one of my passions.\n\n\u201cI want to tell people not to expect to pull themselves together in the blink of an eye. Sometimes, it takes weeks, months or, like in my case, years. My son and I are very close now. I\u2019m happy. I\u2019ve battled my demons and I\u2019m chasing my dreams.\u201d", "description": "Two years ago, she tried to commit suicide.
