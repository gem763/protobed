Aside from snooker being our passion as players, it is also our primary income stream. It\u2019s how I pay for my family going on holidays and having nice things.\n\n\u2018When it isn\u2019t going well it affects everybody. Then it impacts on my mood. I feel like a failure. I feel I\u2019m not being a good husband and a father. I\u2019m failing to provide.\n\n\u2018It is a bit of a downward curve then and then you find yourself spiraling out of control. Before you know it you can be in a very dark place and it is hard to drag yourself out of that and see the light at the end of the tunnel. Fortunately, I feel as if I have done that and things are starting to go well for me.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurphy credits his work with his coach, Chris Henry, and regular practice partner Fergal O\u2019Brien for his return to success in recent weeks after a move to Dublin last year.\n\n\u2018I owe Fergal so much,\u2019 the Englishman continued. \u2018I\u2019ve learned a lot from him as a professional. I thought I was a hard worker and I thought I was a hard practiser. I asked him if he had any tips or advice about my practice. He said straight away: \u201cYes, double it.\u201d So it was quite frank from the off. He elaborated and we talked about why he felt my practice was ineffective and things I could change.\n\n\u2018My coach Chris Henry has also been instrumental. I travelled to Bruges to work with Chris and we found something on the practice table. We were very excited about what we saw and since then it has been an upward curve.\u2019\n\nMurphy takes on Chinese teenager Chang Bingyu in the first round in Crawley next week as he looks to add another title, and \u00a370,000 to his season\u2019s winnings.\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s English Open opponent Jamie O\u2019Neill is back on tour after a \u2018four or five year party\u2019\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan and Judd Trump complete cracking English Open line-up", "description": "Shaun Murphy was 'in a very dark place' during his struggles for form last year but has surged back to prominence in style and heads into the English Open as...", "authors": ["Phil Haigh"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1173710212_1570712651.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
