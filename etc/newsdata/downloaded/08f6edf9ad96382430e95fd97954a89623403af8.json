These days, though, she's been seen sporting sleeker locks in such projects as \"Big Little Lies\" and \"The Goldfinch.\"\n\nInspired by the actress\u2019 look as of late, \u201ckeratin whisperer\u201d Arsen Gurgov told Fox News Lifestyle how to recreate the look at home with just four tools: a hairdryer, round brush, dry texture spray and finishing serum.\n\nGurgov is a Manhattan, New York-based celebrity hairstylist, specializing in the protein-filled chemical keratin treatment, which can smooth and strengthen hair of all lengths and textures for months at a time.\n\nFor starters, the master stylist recommends beginning with clean, semi-wet hair to begin a basic blowout.\n\nGET THE LOOK: EMILY RATAJKOWSKI'S GORGEOUS GLOW\n\n\u201cUse your desired texture spray on damp hair and work it through evenly using fingers and a blow dryer until 90 percent dry \u2014 or when hair starts to get frizzy, if your hair is naturally really curly,\u201d Gurgov said.\n\nThen, he advises wrapping \u201csmall sections\u201d of your tresses \u2013 depending on length and thickness \u2013 around the round brush. Piece by piece, run the blow dryer (ideally one with a nozzle) down the locks, away from the face.\n\n\u201cUnwind hair gently and proceed until all hair is dry and make sure to cool the air off in the brush before you unwind the hair,\u201d Gurgov recommended. \u201cComb through with fingers and apply dry texture spray.\"\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nFor some extra flourish, the industry insider recommended finishing by \"using fingers or a styling brush\" to get the desired look, but stressed the importance of not \u201coverworking\u201d hair during styling.\n\nAs for the famous keratin treatment itself, Gurgov said that a little product would likely go a long way on a head full of natural curls like that of the 52-year-old actress.\n\n\u201cI would use [keratin] mainly at the hairline and through; I would use more to condition and mildly take the frizz out to make the hair weatherproof,\u201d he said of straightening locks like Kidman\u2019s in a more permanent sense.\n\nAs for managing her own mane, Kidman reportedly once shared quite the low-key home remedy to keep blondes and redheads looking their brightest.\n\n\"If you've got red hair, try washing it in cranberry juice. And, if you're blonde, a champagne rinse can work wonders,\u201d the star dished, according to Business Insider.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cGet the Look,\u201d Fox News Lifestyle\u2019s Style + Beauty series, highlights tips and tricks for how to copy A-list looks for less.", "description": "The Oscar winner never seems to have a hair out of place.", "authors": ["Janine Puhak", "Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle.
