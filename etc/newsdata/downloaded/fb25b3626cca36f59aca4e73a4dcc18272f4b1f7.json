But an important momentum indicator, may be suggesting that bulls are building momentum at the current price range, and could push the price of the leading crypto asset by market cap higher.\n\nRelated Reading | Bitcoin Price: Reclaiming Important Moving Average Could Lead to Retest of Highs\n\nAccording to a prominent crypto analyst, the daily MACD \u2013 the moving average convergence divergence indicator \u2013 has recently made a bull cross, and it could result in Bitcoin prices retesting former highs.\n\nDaily MACD bullish crosses always were followed by the price rise.\n\nWe had another one just recently.\n\nAnd at that time MACD is also very low (oversold condition).\n\n$12k as a target until November? \ud83e\udd14$BTC $BTCUSD #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/UlzqD0P6A3 \u2014 CryptoHamster (@CryptoHamsterIO) October 11, 2019\n\nThe analyst has shared a price chart that points out a significant price rise each time the daily MACD indicator crossed bullish. And with this current bullish cross occurring with Bitcoin far below the zero line on the MACD, it indicates that this is the most oversold the crypto asset has been since it started its parabolic rally in April 2019.\n\nBitcoin Price Could Reach $12,000 if Momentum is Sustained\n\nIf the bull cross on the MACD can sustain, and bulls are able to continue the momentum they\u2019re building, the analyst says that a retest of $12,000 could be in the cards. Bitcoin price hasn\u2019t traded at $12,000 since the start of August, and after it failed to break above that level, it\u2019s been in a downtrend ever since.\n\nThe MACD is often considered a lagging indicator, which could suggest that the bullish price action has already played out, and the MACD could begin rolling back downward now that Bitcoin price is once again falling.\n\nA powerful bull flag from lows around $7,800 started a $1,000 rally that may have topped out last night at $8,800. However, if the analyst\u2019s MACD-based prediction plays out, the rejection last night could have been a retest of support that has now been confirmed, and the rally could continue from here, taking Bitcoin price all the way to the $12,000 price level the analyst is targeting.\n\nRelated Reading | Bitcoin Correction Bottom Target Is $6,000, Coincides With Production Cost\n\nIf Bitcoin price cannot make it past current levels, the analyst\u2019s idea will be invalidated and levels below recent local lows would become realistic targets in the days, weeks, and months ahead before the first-ever cryptocurrencty finally turns around and continues on its bull run.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock", "description": "Following a continued downtrend and recent lows around $7,700 being defended by bulls, Bitcoin price is currently trading at $8,300 after a surge to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoin-price-daily-macd-bullish-shutterstock_1040259280-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
