Normally, the legislature writes the statute and the DOR writes the rules to make the program work,\u201d said Komer. \u201cThe state pre-emptively wrote a rule to prevent the program from working.\u201d\n\nIJ filed the lawsuit against the DOR on Dec. 16. The plaintiffs represented by IJ are three mothers who want to send their children to Stillwater Christian School who wanted to apply for the state\u2019s tax credit scholarship program.\n\nThe tax-credit scholarship is Montana\u2019s first school choice program. It provides a credit of up to $150 annually to individuals and businesses that donate to private scholarship organizations. Those organizations then provide scholarships that allow families to send their children to private schools. Tax revenue is forgone, but no state money is spent.\n\nIn its new rule, the DOR said it had the authority under the state constitution to exclude religious schools from the program. At least for now, the court disagreed. Similar programs have passed court muster in other states.\n\nKendra Espinoza, one of the plaintiffs, was elated by the preliminary injunction. She took on a second job last year and fundraised so she could keep her two daughters in Stillwater Christian School.\n\n\u201cI am excited, relieved and so very grateful that my two daughters now have a chance at getting scholarships!\u201d Espinoza said in a prepared statement.\n\nKomer said IJ will seek a permanent injunction to block the rule.", "description": "SCHOOL CHOICE: Three parents are fighting to keep their children .09/02/2019 3:14:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Heather Kays", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/03/court-gavel.jpg"}
