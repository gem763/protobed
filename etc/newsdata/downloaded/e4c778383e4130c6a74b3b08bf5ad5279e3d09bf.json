We\u2019ve had no contact with him for 10 years. I told him to get lost when he wanted me to become his financial guarantor,\u201d his brother Franz B. told Kronen Zeitung newspaper.\n\nJosef B. had twin daughters with a Japanese woman, Franz B. added.", "description": "The Hague (AFP) \u2013 A Dutch judge on Thursday ordered the detention of an Austrian suspected of holding a family captive in a farmhouse, as reports", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/638124_58-year-old-austrian-as-josef-was-detained-police-freed-father-six-adult-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
