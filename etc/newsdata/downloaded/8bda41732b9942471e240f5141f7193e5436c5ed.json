Turkey suspects that the U.S. is backing Kurdish aspirations for self-rule in Syria and is prepared to use military force to prevent what it perceives as an attempt to redraw the region\u2019s map.\n\nTurkey wants to act before winter conditions make it difficult for tanks to operate in muddy terrain, leaving little room for a last-minute agreement with the U.S.\n\nErdogan has repeatedly called on the U.S. to join forces in expanding a previously negotiated security zone in Syria -- designed to be off-limits to American-backed Kurdish YPG forces -- while threatening an incursion if he didn\u2019t get his way by the end of last month.\n\nThe YPG, which helped defeat Islamic State, has been at the heart of Turkey-U.S. tensions. Turkey sees the fighters as a critical threat given their link to the separatist PKK, an autonomy-seeking Kurdish group. It\u2019s considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the European Union.\n\nErdogan wants to resettle some of the more than 3.6 million Syrians who fled their country\u2019s civil war in the buffer area to alleviate the burden on Turkey\u2019s economy and defuse social tensions over hosting the world\u2019s largest refugee population.\n\n(Adds context starting with fifth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Selcan Hacaoglu in Ankara at shacaoglu@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Onur Ant at oant@bloomberg.net, ;Alaa Shahine at asalha@bloomberg.net, Tony Czuczka\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Turkey reinforced army units at the Syrian border hours after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan signaled an imminent cross-border operation against U.S.-backed Kurdish militants in Syria.Turkey sent additional armored vehicles and troops to the border town of Akcakale late Saturday, across", "authors": ["Selcan Hacaoglu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/brKq3JbMQLi7xHoe_2KnHw--~B/aD05Nzg7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/ce026804fafda4918816778e50aaf17d", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
