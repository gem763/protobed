Security Council response to the attacks on Saudi oil facilities that the United States blames on Iran, but it was unclear what action he sought or whether Washington might secure Russian cooperation.\n\n\u201cWe do see a role for the U.N. Security Council to play. Saudi was attacked and it would be appropriate for them to call upon the council. But we first need to gather the releasable information,\u201d the senior U.S. official told reporters.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not explain what he meant by \u201creleasable information.\u201d The United States has, at times, released previously classified information to buttress its case at the Security Council.\n\nThe United States believes the attacks that crippled Saudi Arabian oil facilities last weekend originated in southwestern Iran, a second U.S. official told Reuters.\n\nWhile it was not clear what action by the 15-member Security Council the first official envisaged, there are several options that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has suggested over the past year but that Washington has not actively pursued.\n\nSuccess is unlikely because diplomats say Russia and China - which are council veto powers along with the United States, France and Britain - are likely to shield Iran.\n\nRussia and China have already warned against jumping to conclusions over who was behind the attack.\n\nAsked on Wednesday whether China would support taking the Saudi attacks to the Security Council, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated China\u2019s condemnation of the attack and call for restraint.\n\n\u201cChina will remain in communication with the relevant parties on the situation as it develops,\u201d he added, without elaborating.\n\nAt a minimum, the U.N. Security Council could issue a statement condemning the attack, but such a move has to be agreed by consensus.\n\nMost U.N. sanctions on Iran were lifted in 2016 under the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers. But Iran is still subject to a U.N. arms embargo and other restrictions under a 2015 resolution that enshrines the nuclear accord.\n\nLast year, Pompeo urged the council to prevent Iran from working on ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and from carrying out test launches. He also called for \u201cinspection and interdiction measures, in ports and on the high seas,\u201d to keep Iran from circumventing arms restrictions.\n\nLast month, Pompeo told the council Iran must not become \u201cunshackled to create new turmoil\u201d when a U.N. arms embargo on the country and a travel ban on the head of Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force expire in October 2020.", "description": "A senior U.S. official on Tuesday called for a U.N.
