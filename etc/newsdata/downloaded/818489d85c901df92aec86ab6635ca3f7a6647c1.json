They need to be designed in a way that supports and favours population growth and development of far north Australia.\"\n\nIn 2016-17, about 500,000 Australians or 3 per cent of all taxpayers claimed the zone tax offset \u2013 including 75 per cent of taxpayers in the NT.\n\nAbout 105,000 taxpayers nationally received the remote area allowance the following financial year.\n\nThe offset costs the federal budget about $156 million annually. A broad-ranging estimate by Treasury puts the cost of concessions at somewhere between $120 million and $1.2 billion a year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg announced a review of the rules in March, asking the Productivity Commission to make sure the tax breaks remain fair and contemporary, and raising the prospect of some of the largest groups of claimants being removed.\n\nBig four accounting firm KPMG has told the commission remote area boundaries should be reconsidered, calling for Australian Bureau of Statistics boundaries to be used for the calculation of fringe benefit tax for remote, regional and other areas.\n\n\"The fringe benefits tax consequences of a locality ceasing to qualify for the concessions could inflict considerable additional costs on employers, and substantially reduce the after-tax income of employees who had salary-packaged certain remote area benefits on an FBT-inclusive basis,\" the firm said in a submission.\n\nKPMG said it did not support a proposal to end exemptions for employer-provided accommodation and instead be eligible for a 50 per cent reduction in taxable value.\n\n\"As Australia's population grows, there is a strategic benefit in supporting that population in spreading out beyond the capital cities and their suburbs.\"\n\nA final report will go to Mr Frydenberg in February.", "description": "Tax breaks designed to compensate for living remote areas with 'uncongenial climates\" are seeing their first major review since the 1940s.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2348%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_183%2C$y_42/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f84a0ea030208892c1620a680bb24e641562e75f", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
