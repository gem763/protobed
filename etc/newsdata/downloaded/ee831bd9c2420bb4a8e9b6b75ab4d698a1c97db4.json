U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures were 35 cents or 0.63% lower at $55.56 a barrel.\n\nChina\u2019s official Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) rose to 49.8 in September, slightly better than expected and advancing from 49.5 in August.\n\nHowever, it remained below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed.\n\nThe PMI data \u201cremained in contractionary territory for the fifth month in a row, indicating that economic fundamentals were still weak,\u201d Citi analysts said in a note.\n\n\u201cThe (Chinese) government will certainly step up fiscal and monetary efforts to boost domestic demand, which we believe can help stabilize, probably not accelerate, economic growth.\u201d\n\nTop oil exporter Saudi Arabia has restored capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day after an attack on its processing facilities this month, sources told Reuters last week, although Saudi Aramco has yet to confirm it is fully back online.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia is maintaining exports by using crude from inventories and spare production capacity, how much of its output has actually been restored remains unclear.\n\nMoney managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to Sept. 24, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.\n\n\u201cClearly, speculators have taken comfort from Saudi comments and the speed at which they plan to bring supply back to the market,\u201d ING bank said in a note.\n\n\u201cHowever, we still believe that the market is underpricing the geopolitical risk in the region.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: The sun sets behind an oil pump outside Saint-Fiacre, near Paris, France September 17, 2019.
