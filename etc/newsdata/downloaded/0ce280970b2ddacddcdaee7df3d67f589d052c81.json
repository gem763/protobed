It\u2019s symbolic of change and their desire for a better life!\u201d\n\nMany on Twitter slammed the post for its suggestion that cutting off locs is somehow synonymous with a \u201cbetter life,\u201d citing a history of Black hair discrimination and racist beliefs that natural Black hairstyles are linked with violence.\n\nThursday\u2019s post came after TMZ reported that Jay-Z\u2019s company Roc Nation and the NFL \u2014 via their new partnership and social justice initiative, Inspire Change \u2014 will donate $200,000 to two organizations, including Crushers Club, which says it aims to empower at-risk youth in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago.\n\nCrushers Club has now deleted some of the above \ud83d\uddd1 tweets.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd26Researchers know to always screenshots.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf8: Tweets and pics of the Crushers Club practice of cutting off the locs of Black youth.\n\n\n\nThis group got thousands in NFL #InspireChange \ud83d\udcb0. pic.twitter.com/yKUisKF6vo \u2014 Resist Programming \ud83d\udef0 (@RzstProgramming) September 6, 2019\n\nThe Twitter account @RzstProgramming on Friday joined the chorus of people voicing their renewed skepticism that Jay-Z\u2019s partnership with the NFL would adequately tackle social justice issues.\n\nWhy is the NFL + Roc Nation doubling down to fund the cutting off of locs to conform to white expectations? Why not announce a re-evaluation or demand the practice to stop?\n\n\n\nWe were told #InspireChange T-Shirts are dropping soon. When will the #InspireChange craft scissors drop? pic.twitter.com/W1pyQe6dSa \u2014 Resist Programming \ud83d\udef0 (@RzstProgramming) September 6, 2019\n\nAccording to screenshots of since-deleted posts, the Crushers Club Twitter account had once tweeted \u201cALL LIVES MATTER\u201d in 2016 in response to the fatal shootings of five Dallas police officers. Last year, the organization tweeted a request for President Donald Trump to come to Chicago to help fight gang violence, among other posts.\n\nNeither Roc Nation or the NFL responded to requests for comment.\n\nHazelgrove told HuffPost on Friday that she never intended for the old tweets to come off as \u201cinsensitive.\u201d\n\nShe said the young men in the photos had asked her to cut their hair in an effort to \u201crebrand\u201d themselves, and that one of those men, whose photo was widely circulated, wanted a \u201cnew identity\u201d because his life was in danger from \u201cengaging in gang activity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tweeted it without a lot of forethought, to be honest, so I understand how that could be interpreted as insensitive,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI have biracial children myself,\u201d she later added.\n\nWhen asked about how the Crushers Club\u2019s post drew a troubling connection to incidents of Black hair discrimination, Hazelgrove replied: \u201cI do not really have any comment on that, we do not have any policy regarding hair. We don\u2019t even discuss hairstyles to be perfectly honest.\u201d\n\n\"I said {All Lives Matter} not to take away from black lives matter, but to be inclusive of everyone,\" Hazelgrove said. \"I never meant to belittle or disrespect anyone.\"\n\n\n\nSounds like she hasn't had anti-racism training, but leading @crushersclub & receiving $200K. #InspireChange https://t.co/yeYP6s0iP0 \u2014 April (@ReignOfApril) September 6, 2019\n\nHazelgrove later stated that the tweet using \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d \u2014 a slogan criticized for undermining the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 was intended to focus on inclusivity, and that she supports Black lives. She said she doesn\u2019t \u201cendorse anyone\u2019s policies,\u201d with regards to the old Trump tweet, and claimed that she has previously reached out to other elected officials, such as former President Barack Obama and former Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel.\n\nOn Friday, Roc Nation \ufeffretweeted a video from one of the men seen getting their locs cut by Hazelgrove in 2016. He said in the video that he cut his hair three years ago because it was something he \u201cwanted to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was tired of gang banging, tired of messing up, now I\u2019m a changed young man,\u201d he added.\n\nAcclaimed director Ava DuVernay criticized the 2016 photos earlier on Friday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to have a conversation with you and those young people about dreads and desires and dreams,\u201d she tweeted to Crushers Club. \u201cAbout dreads and \u2018a better life.\u2019 Shame on anyone supporting this full-on nonsense.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d like to have a conversation with you and those young people about dreads and desires and dreams. About dreads and \u201ca better life.\u201d\n\n\n\nShame on anyone supporting this full-on nonsense. https://t.co/NgHmoOKf0r \u2014 Ava DuVernay (@ava) September 6, 2019", "description": "Old tweets showing two young Black men at a Chicago-based organization getting their hair cut for a \"better life\" sparked criticism on Twitter.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d72d3b7230000500051268b.jpeg?cache=1wxgdhihcn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
