Some schools and banks have been closed for more than a week.\n\nIn one of the most serious incidents, the army opened fire on Friday to confront a group of protesters blocking a road in Tripoli, wounding at least six people.\n\nBut the unprecedented protest movement has been relatively incident-free, despite tensions with the armed forces and attempts by party loyalists to stage counter-demonstrations.\n\nProtesters have been demanding the removal of the entire ruling class, which has remained largely unchanged in three decades. Many of the political heavyweights are former warlords seen as representing little beyond their own sectarian or geographical community.\n\nThe protesters see them as corrupt and incompetent and have so far dismissed measures proposed by the political leadership to quell the protests.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had the same people in charge for 30 years,\u201d said Elie, a 40-year-old demonstrator walking in central Beirut on Sunday morning with a Lebanese flag.\n\nOn Monday, the prime minister, Saad Hariri, announced a package of economic reforms that aim to revive an economy that has been on the brink of collapse for months. His coalition partners have supported the move and warned that a political vacuum in times of economic peril risked chaos.\n\nBut the protesters have accused the political elite of desperately attempting to save their jobs and have stuck to their demands for deep, systemic change. In a now well-established routine, entire families of volunteers showed up early on the main protest sites Sunday to clean up after another night of protests and parties.\n\nAfter dusk, the central Martyrs Square in Beirut and other protest hubs in Lebanon turn into a vast, open ground where protesters dance, sing or organise political meetings.", "description": "Anti-government grassroots movement says it wants to foster feeling of national unity", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Beirut"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cd96c0e9a706d23f8c0d4fb0c64d928afbf461c/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=37a808f6524065a1e02ba2449e0ab738", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
