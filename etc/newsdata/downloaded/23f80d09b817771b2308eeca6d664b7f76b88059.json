The waterfall was closed off to visitors while officials remove the carcasses.\n\n\u201cThe two elephants right now are taking a rest. They are exhausted from trying to cross the stream,\u201d said Chanaya Kanchanasaka, a veterinarian at the park, located 120 Kilometers (80 miles) northeast of Bangkok.\n\nThe ravines usually fill up with gushing water during a rainy season. In 1992, eight elephants died after falling into the water.\n\nThe park is home to about 300 wild elephants and is part of Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai Forest Complex, a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A herd of wild elephants was swept away by raging waters in Thailand's national park, drowning six, while rangers helped steer two animals out of a deep ravine.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
