(OK, M-W didn\u2019t exactly say that, but they have published a list of their favourite Latin phrases, so it\u2019s a fair conclusion.)\n\nSome of these you might already know. Some you\u2019ve probably heard but can\u2019t quite remember the meaning. And some are brand new but are worth implementing immediately.\n\nPost hoc, ergo propter hoc\n\nDefinition: After this, therefore because of this. It is \u201cthe logical mistake of claiming that one thing caused another just because it happened first.\u201d In other words, correlation does not equal causation.\n\nMerriam-Webster says we have Aristotle to thank for beginning to classifying these illogical arguments. I stepped outside and it started to rain. Did my walking outside actually cause it to rain? It might feel that way, but to truly believe it would be a logical fallacy \u2014 post hoc, ergo propter hoc.\n\n(If you\u2019re still not convinced you need to add this phrase into the rotation, say it out loud with me: Post hoc, ergo propter hoc. That\u2019s good stuff.)\n\nPer angusta ad augusta\n\nDefinition: Through difficulties to honours, through trial to triumph, or through difficulties to great things. It\u2019s another way of saying, \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d\n\nThis reminds me of a phrase my husband and I would often say during our foster parenting years: \u201cWe can do hard things.\u201d Per angusta ad augusta would make for a good mantra or family motto.\n\nVeni, vidi, vici\n\nDefinition: I came, I saw, I conquered.\n\nWe might use this phrase in jest today, maybe after a particularly epic showing at a lunch buffet. But if it was first written by Julius Caesar, as it is widely attributed, it was meant quite literally. He used the words in a war report after achieving a swift victory around 47 BC.\n\nIn vino veritas\n\nDefinition: \u201cThere is truth in wine\u201d or \u201cin wine lies the truth.\u201d It\u2019s the idea that someone who has had too much to drink will have lowered inhibitions and is more inclined to say what they really think.\n\nThe phrase is sometimes extended to \u201cIn vino veritas, in aqua sanitas.\u201d Or, \u201cIn wine there is truth, in water there is health/good sense.\u201d Use this one as an apology or explanation the next time you \u2014 or a loved one \u2014 have a little too much to drink and start spouting all your innermost thoughts.\n\nCaveat emptor\n\nDefinition: Let the buyer beware.\n\nMerriam-Webster says this one comes from early Roman law, when buyers were urged to really inspect a good before they bought it so they wouldn\u2019t get ripped off. We liked this one so much that we adopted the word \u201ccaveat\u201d in English to mean \u201ca warning enjoining one from certain acts or practices.\u201d\n\nAmazon comes to mind with this phrase, for some reason.\n\nAmor vincit omnia\n\nDefinition: Love conquers all things.\n\nWe attribute this phrase \u2014 which is another one you often hear in English \u2014 to the Roman poet Virgil, who wrote, \u201clove conquers all things; let us too surrender to love,\u201d right before the start of the first millennium, according to Merriam-Webster. Since then, the phrase has been used by a number of poets and appeared in The Canterbury Tales in the late 1300s.", "description": "Merriam-Webster wants us all to use more Latin in our everyday lives, and we see no reason not to oblige.
