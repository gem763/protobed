Individuals often do not evaluate their trust in institutions correctly. This misreading can occur when organizations use simple cues to generate trust\u2014something that the general population agrees with but without accompanying explicit action.[13] For example, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff may call for reduced micromanagement to the delight of eager listeners, but tasks delivered through detailed command styles continue. [14] These processes can lead to manipulation, disillusionment, and poor performance.[15] Without acknowledgment, trust deficits magnify the gap between what the organization practices and preaches. The most powerful equipment or concept in the arsenal is diminished without the trust of its users. Army mission command is not exempt from this powerful transformation.\n\nWhile the new Mission Command is a handbook on how to build unit trust to enable success in battle, the Army does not possess an institutional equivalent. Thus, the force does not have a formal process to acknowledge, signal, and remediate institutional pressures and their effect on trust. Instead, internal and external forces continue to mold Army mission command, thereby delivering uneven and unintended execution during operations.\n\nPhilosophy, Culture, and the Future Fight\n\nA recalibrated institutional trust in mission command is necessary to improve operational effectiveness. A healthy trust mitigates the internal and external praxis pressures that alter U.S. Army mission command. This starts by understanding several key trends occurring at the intersection of mission command philosophy, U.S. Army culture, and future fights. They collectively paint a picture of a force that is both uncomfortable balancing risk and reward and uniquely biased toward centralization in the modern environment.\n\nTrend One: Institutional Biases Restrict Mission Command\n\nThe absorption of mission command into a military culture is a nonlinear process. Uneven implementation occurs along the way. This is triggered in a new environment, be it time or place, by the U.S. Army\u2019s cultural biases that both delay and alter the brand of mission command in practice.\n\nU.S. Army reversions typically stem from a recurring bias towards solving problems through technology- and efficiency-based strategies. Cold War doctrine is a prime example. Fluctuations in decentralization occurred in the 1970s and 1980s through multiple doctrinal changes as the U.S. Army relearned how to balance new technological tools with human capacity against the Soviet threat. The force eventually embraced individual initiative over organizational efficiency, and mission command principles over detailed command tenets, to overcome a numerically superior enemy.[16] Similar vacillations occurred in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the U.S. Army used dispersed and decentralized command structures within a mission command framework, its command in practice was centralized in pursuit of near-perfect information access.[17] Environmental triggers extend beyond the battlefield to training as well. The Army struggled to apply mission command principles during periods of budgetary constraints in the 1990s and the 2010s, favoring centralized decision making to plan and execute training.[18] When available resources decreased, the Army turned to technology-driven solutions like digital simulation and efficiency-driven solutions such as centrally mandated pre-deployment training schedules to achieve mission requirements.\n\nNot only does modern technology pull Army leaders away from the mission command the service espouses, but cultural biases push it away.\n\nThe brand of mission command inherently varies due to the requirements and resources available in the environment. Over time nonlinearities appear, formed by reversions toward centralization in practice. This is not inherently bad\u2014at times the centralization is essential\u2014but the trend reverberates in a culture. It creates a partial implementation of mission command within a given generation of leaders as the philosophy deviates actual results from intended doctrine. This exemplifies Shamir\u2019s Praxis transformation. These reversions usually trend along with cultural biases. Not only does modern technology pull Army leaders away from the mission command the service espouses, but cultural biases push it away.\n\nTrend Two: Technology Does Not Remove Friction. Technology Transforms It.\n\nMission command is intended to reduce these battlefield effects of friction, the grey area between intended wartime plans from their uncertain results.[19] However, due to technological changes, friction manifests differently today. The rapid integration of the Internet of Things into the military space proliferates information, enabling the collection, aggregation, and utilization of data. This process naturally increases the quality of information at higher echelons of command.[20]\n\nHowever, modern technology mutates but does not remove battlefield friction.[21] Unprecedented information access is impeded by the ability to deny and distort the very same decision-making inputs. Distributed denial of service and spoofing operations are indefinite realites in the modern fight.[22] Today\u2019s overreliance on information increases the likelihood that adversaries will use information disruption to achieve surprise.[23]\n\nFriction also stems from the unknown reaction by the enemy and one\u2019s own forces.[24] Information augments but does not replace the need to understand this human dimension. Decentralized control remains key to capturing localized information available only on the periphery of human systems.[25] These structures harness the human dimension to convert data into battlefield innovation.[26] Decentralized human insight will only increase in importance as automation proliferates the battlefield and pushes the limits of human cognitive ability to manage information.[27]\n\nAs friction transforms in a world of evolving threats, mission command remains the map and compass, the fallback setting.\n\nWhile sources of friction change over time, the nature of war does not. As technology raises an optimal level of situation awareness and control, the U.S. Army may not always desire to practice mission command. However, it needs to retain the ability. Leaders must apply discretion and resist the urge to add measures of control just because the methods are available.[28] This maintains the decentralized understanding and willingness to act that will be critical in a multi-domain fight.[29] Technological change exemplifies Shamir\u2019s Praxis transformation, but it cannot occur completely at the expense of trust. As friction transforms in a world of evolving threats, mission command remains the map and compass, the fallback setting.\n\nTrend Three: Mission Command Excels Tactically But Bears Risk Strategically\n\nWithout satisfactory control, mission command can simultaneously drive tactical success and strategic failure. This effect extends from the philosophy\u2019s structure. Mission command is designed to identify and exploit opportunity through decentralized decision making. However, mission command also enables the possibility to excel at the tactical level but act within a strategic vacuum.[30] By defaulting to emergent situational awareness at the lowest level, the philosophy can separate tactical and strategic outcomes at decisive points of action.[31] The risk is greatest in environments where learning costs are high. These environments are defined by limited clear communications and political capital.[32]\n\nImagine a scenario where a subordinate unit attempts to exploit an emergent opportunity. While this secondary action may be in line with original guidance, a unit in a high learning cost environment may not understand changing macro consequences of additional action. This type of decision making is heralded under mission command but can create destructive divergent outcomes.[33] Future battlefields may require careful coordination across multiple commands for a single opportunity to penetrate and exploit a modern enemy defense.[34] In short, the fight may require more discipline than initiative and more detailed command than mission command.\n\nModern conflict also increasingly ties tactical actions to strategic outcomes. This spans from the strategic corporal in low-intensity conflict to major combat operations in multiple domains.[35] In these environments the best situational awareness, and by extension the best decision making, may reside at higher command echelons. The centralization of awareness is a double-edged sword. While capabilities in Iraq and Afghanistan provided unprecedented information access for headquarters, it also provided command echelons the means to suffocate subordinate empowerment via increased control.[36] These measures can rapidly erode trust, corrupting a unit\u2019s ability to execute decentralized operations when needed.\n\nMission command creates a paradox of risk and reward in modern environments. Commands must retain the flexibility to use increased control given technological advancement and the prospect of large-scale operations. However, they must also balance the necessity for increased control with a force\u2019s trust and tactical effectiveness. Risk entails opportunity and reward. Detailed command is not a permanent means to mitigate risk, nor is mission command the sole way to exploit opportunity. A force that understands this reality at its lowest levels can build institutional and unit trust around transparent and targeted controls oriented on strategic risk, posturing the force to exploit opportunity.\n\nPaying The Trust Bill", "description": "The U.S. Army is in the midst of the most important rethinking of doctrine since the Cold War.
