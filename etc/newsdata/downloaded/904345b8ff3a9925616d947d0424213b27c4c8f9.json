This list includes France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany and Britain.\n\nSome stations in London, for example, reported levels of more than 50 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per cubic meter of air, compared with the legal EU annual mean concentration of 40 micrograms.\n\nOn Tuesday, the British government proposed a new environment bill that includes legally binding targets to reduce fine particles in the air and forcing vehicle manufacturers to recall cars that do not meet particle emission standards.\n\nReducing the number of cars is an important factor in reducing air pollution in cities, especially of nitrogen dioxide, Ortiz said.\n\n\"When we fight pollution, we also fight climate change as well as noise and promote more healthy behavior. It's a win-win,\" he added.\n\n(Reporting by Jonas Ekblom; Editing by Nina Chestney and Mark Potter)", "description": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Poor air quality caused about 400,000 premature deaths in Europe in 2016, the most recent year data is available, and almost every city-dwelling European is exposed to pollution levels that exceed healthy levels, according to a report on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Jonas Ekblom"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
