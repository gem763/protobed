(Photo: Scribner)\n\nThe 9th edition of \u201cJoy of Cooking,\u201d which was first published in 1931, will be published Nov. 12. Here are some things to know about what has been called America's most popular cookbook.\n\n\u201cThe Joy of Cooking\u201d originally was self-published in 1931 by Irma S. Rombauer, a 54-year-old St. Louis homemaker, following her husband\u2019s death by suicide. The full title was \u201cThe Joy of Cooking: A Compilation of Reliable Recipes with a Casual Culinary Chat,\u201d and it had just 300 recipes, compared with some 4,600 today. The first commercial edition was published in 1936 by the Bobbs-Merrill Co.\n\nUse of the word \u201cjoy\u201d in the title was deliberate. The Depression sped up the demise of kitchen help that had been available not just to the wealthy but also to middle class families, Anne Mendelson writes in \u201cStand Facing the Stove.\u201d Rombauer wanted to assure her \u201csisters\u201d new to kitchen tasks that cooking was \u201cnot only a virtue but a delight.\u201d\n\nThe original \"Joy of Cooking\" featured this illustration of St. Martha of Bethany, the patron saint of cooking, slaying the dragon of kitchen drudgery, by Marion Rombauer Becker. Here, it's shown on the cover of a facsimile edition published by Scribner in 1998.

It depicts St. Martha of Bethany, the patron saint of cooking, slaying the dragon of kitchen drudgery.\n\n\u201cJoy of Cooking\u201d has been a family affair all along. After Irma Rombauer died in 1962, Marion assumed the \u201cJoy\u201d mantle with publication of the 1963 edition. Her son Ethan Becker helped her revise the 1975 edition and then oversaw the 1997 and 2006 editions. This latest edition was undertaken by his son, John Becker, with John\u2019s wife, Megan Scott.\n\nAlmost 20 million copies of \u201cJoy of Cooking\u201d are in print today. It has been published continuously since 1936.\n\nIt is considered the most popular American cookbook, with the 1975 version the most favored (so far) of all the editions.\n\n\"Joy of Cooking\" has undergone many revisions since 1931 but is still considered America's most popular cookbook.

Translation rights have been sold in Korean and Chinese.\n\nThe New York Public Library named \u201cJoy of Cooking\u201d one of the 150 most influential books of the 20th century.\n\nThe 2019 book is a larger format than previous editions, measuring 9 3/8 by 8 3/8 inches. It contains 1,156 pages and weighs a hefty 4 pounds, 12\u00be ounces \u2014 a full pound more than the 2006 edition.
