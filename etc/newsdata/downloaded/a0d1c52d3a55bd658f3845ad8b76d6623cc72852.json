The overall prize pool for the 2019 season is $5 million.\n\nThe Overwatch League in February began releasing Nielsen viewership reports on the average number of people who watch any minute of a league event, among other Nielsen-backed numbers.\n\nThis average-minute audience, or AMA, number has long been used by traditional sports leagues and broadcasters to show the reach of live sports across a full broadcast.\n\nNielsen metrics and the average audience numbers in particular help simplify the pitch to advertisers because they are familiar data points, said Frank Puma, investment business lead at ad agency Mindshare USA.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\n\u201cAs advertisers look for more and more video inventory, especially within the 18-34 [demographic], this is something that will help Activision Blizzard be part of the conversation,\u201d Mr. Puma said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is saying: Here is our audience and we are willing to sell in the way you need to buy it. They are making it more digestible for ad buyers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisers in the Overwatch League have included Coca-Cola, Bud Light and Toyota.\n\nProviding average-minute ratings has helped Overwatch League sign deals with advertisers that aren\u2019t endemic to esports, said Kasra Jafroodi, strategy and analytics lead at Activision Blizzard Esports.\n\nAcross the Overwatch League\u2019s 2019 regular season, which began in February and will close with its grand finals in September, the league has averaged a global average-minute audience of 313,000 viewers, up 18% year over year, according to the Nielsen data. That includes viewing on digital platforms such as Twitch and Asian streaming players including Zhanqi and Huya, as well as linear broadcasts in the U.S. and Canada on ABC, ESPN and TSN. Less than a third of Overwatch League\u2019s viewership was in the U.S.\n\nThe season has comprised 526 hours of content so far, according to Mr. Jafroodi.\n\nViewership for Overwatch League peaked during key moments of the regular season, which is broken up into four different stages before the grand finals in the fall. For example, the final week of stage three averaged 466,000 global viewers per minute, up 86% year over year, according to the Nielsen data.\n\nOverwatch League trails far behind leagues like the NFL and NBA, which can pull in tens of millions of viewers in the U.S. alone during major games, but the esports league boasts a growing audience.\n\n\u201cIt was critical for us to join the conversation about the most popular and most watched sports programming in the world,\u201d said Pete Vlastelica, chief executive of Activision Blizzard Esports and commissioner of the Overwatch League.\n\n\u201c \u201cIt was critical for us to join the conversation about the most popular and most watched sports programming in the world.\u201d \u201d \u2014Pete Vlastelica, chief executive of Activision Blizzard Esports and commissioner of the Overwatch League\n\n\u201cThere were these old-school digital vanity metrics like unique viewers and peak concurrent viewers that the esports industry has been using for a long time to brag about reach\u2014but those numbers don\u2019t mean anything if you can\u2019t make an apples-to-apples comparison with other programming that we are trying to compete with,\u201d Mr. Vlastelica added.\n\nA key part of Overwatch League\u2019s pitch to advertisers is its reach among 18- to 34-year-olds, a demographic that is becoming increasingly harder to reach on traditional TV. Overwatch League averaged 55,000 U.S. viewers per minute in that group during the regular season, up 11% year over year.\n\nOverwatch League was the first esports promoter to sign a deal with Nielsen to track its average audiences, but other esports giants including Tencent Holdings Ltd.-owned Riot Games have followed suit.\n\nThe two-year-old league will be profitable this year, Mr. Vlastelica said.\n\nWrite to Sahil Patel at sahil.patel@wsj.com", "description": "Activision Blizzard\u2019s Overwatch League is using a longtime TV measurement yardstick to make it easier for advertisers to consider its programming alongside traditional sports on broadcast and cable.", "authors": ["Sahil Patel", "Sahil.Patel Wsj.Com", "Pete Vlastelica", "Chief Executive Of Activision Blizzard Esports", "Commissioner Of The Overwatch League"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103644/social"}
