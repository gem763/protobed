They\u2019re both socialists \u2026 err, sorry \u2026 Socialist Democrats, they both resent corporate America, they both love having their own money but gripe about other people keeping more of theirs.\n\nSo her speech came as no surprise:\n\nRep. @AOC: \"When I was a child that relied on CHIP so that I could see a doctor, Bernie Sanders fought for a single-payer healthcare system.\" pic.twitter.com/t8TJHYWSrC \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) October 19, 2019\n\nBlah blah blah.\n\nYeah, we get it. Socialism GOOD. *eye roll*\n\nFor whatever reason Neera Tanden felt the need to bring Hillary up in regard to AOC\u2019s speech, which really makes zero sense. Why do this? Unless of course the Wicked Witch of the Lost Election really is going to try and run again.\n\n@HillaryClinton was a key architect of CHIP. I worked on its implementation with her. I\u2019m so glad it provided health care to @AOC and millions more. https://t.co/EiMqQ5p9Hs \u2014 Neera Tanden (@neeratanden) October 19, 2019\n\nThis is just obnoxious.\n\nSeriously.\n\nYou know it\u2019s bad if we\u2019re giving AOC credit here \u2026\n\nAOC responded:\n\nHi Neera! I\u2019m deeply thankful for Sec. Clinton\u2019s leadership and role in the establishment of CHIP. I am also looking forward to fighting for an America that treats healthcare as a right for *all* people, regardless of their age, income, or background, with #MedicareForAll. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u270c\ud83c\udffd \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 19, 2019\n\nIn other words, like the rest of us, AOC remembers Hillary slamming and trashing Bernie\u2019s healthcare plans the first time around. You know, the time when she and the DNC screwed Bernie out of the nomination because it was supposedly \u2018her turn\u2019?\n\nHi Congresswoman! This is such a great message. @HillaryClinton\u2019s goal was always universal coverage \u2013 health care as a right for all. She made progress wherever she could \u2013 CHIP is an example of that. Admire your leadership on health care and so many other issues. \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b \u2014 Neera Tanden (@neeratanden) October 19, 2019\n\nUh-huh.\n\nThis was just so awkward.\n\nNeera conveniently forgot several key points about Hillary\u2019s support (or lack of) for Bernie\u2019s healthcare plan.\n\nShe was not a \"key architect.\" Teddy Kennedy & Orin Hatch designed & passed legislation in the aftermath of HRC's bungling of health care through both arrogance and ignorance. Clinton DID support it behind the scenes and kudos to her for that, but that was the extent of her role. \u2014 Laraine (@laflemm12) October 19, 2019\n\nShe supported CHIP.\n\nBig whoop. Neera makes it sound like Hillary all but created it.\n\nHillary Clinton cares more about selectively giving as little as possible to the American people & pleasing her Oligarch, corporate donors than she cares about any of #NotMeUs pic.twitter.com/MWj2ccql5l \u2014 Kulinskicrat | #Bernie2020 | #AnyOldBlueJustWontDo (@Kulinski_crat_1) October 19, 2019\n\nSee what we mean?\n\nHillary also said that \"Universal Healthcare would never come to pass\" which means, like with all corporate centrist Dems, better things aren't possible.\n\nI'm with the progressives with the policies that will be moving this country forward for EVERYONE. #Bernie2020 #NotMeUs pic.twitter.com/KU5FbH3pMC \u2014 GingerFnSnapps\ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc80 (@Nacho_Mama78) October 19, 2019\n\nBernie Bros don\u2019t forgive OR forget, Hill-dawg.\n\nRelated:\n\nHypocrite MUCH?!
