He did so at the expense of longstanding foreign policy, a critical international alliance and the stability of the global order \u2014 and he used hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to do it.\n\nThe nation has known the basic outlines of this story for weeks, thanks to the bravery of a C.I.A. whistle-blower and others. But in 15 pages, Mr. Taylor laid out with a stunning degree of detail the extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to extort Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son over supposed corruption.\n\nYou know it\u2019s bad for the president when the only response the White House can muster is to sidestep the testimony and complain instead about \u201ca coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution.\u201d\n\nWould that be the same Constitution that Mr. Trump referred to, in part, as \u201cphony\u201d just this week ? Also, \u201cradical unelected bureaucrat\u201d is a curious way to describe Mr. Taylor, who currently serves as Mr. Trump\u2019s acting envoy to Ukraine and is a retired career civil servant and Vietnam War veteran who has served under both Republican and Democratic presidents.", "description": "Mr. Trump\u2019s own acting envoy, William Taylor, described how the president tried to force Ukraine to advance his political interests.", "authors": ["Jesse Wegman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/opinion/22taylorWeb/22taylorWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
