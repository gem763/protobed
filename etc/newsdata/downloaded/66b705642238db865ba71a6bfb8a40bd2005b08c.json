The man then allegedly attacked Kevin and ripped its head off.\n\n\u201cRPSCA WA is concerned to hear about another senseless act of violence against an animal,\u201d Chief Inspector Amanda Swift said in a statement shared on Saturday.\n\n\u201cSadly, right now under Western Australian law, it does not appear that this horrific act constitutes an offence under the Animal Welfare Act 2002.\n\n\u201cWhile RSPCA WA Inspectors can only take action under the Animal Welfare Act where an animal has suffered, the incident with Kevin the Kookaburra may have contravened laws designed specifically to protect native wildlife.\u201d\n\nIn other words, RSPCA can\u2019t technically prove the poor kookaburra suffered because it was killed so quickly. Which is bullshit.\n\nOn Monday, Agriculture and Food Minister Alannah MacTiernan confirmed the act is under review.\n\n\u201cWe are now checking with the department whether or not this can be characterised as an act of animal cruelty,\u201d she told reporters, per Nine News.\n\nIf a loophole is found, MacTiernan said it could lead to changes to the Animal Welfare Act.\n\n\u201cQuite clearly we need a law that would stop that appalling behaviour happening,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a post that has since been removed from its Facebook page, the Parkerville Tavern team said they were \u201cstill in disbelief about the barbaric attack on one of nature\u2019s gifts.\u201d\n\nStaff has asked the public for no further comments regarding the incident to be made on its social media pages.\n\n\u201cWe are awaiting further information from the police and we will know more soon.\n\n\u201cWe would like to thank you all for your support.\u201d", "description": "WA's Agriculture and Food Minister has vowed to examine the legalities around native wildlife protection after a kookaburra was killed at a Perth tavern.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-12.49.29-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
