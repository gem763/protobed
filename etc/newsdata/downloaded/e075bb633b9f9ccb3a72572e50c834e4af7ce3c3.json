The headwinds from a major global slowdown and uncertainty at home point to weaker growth ahead,\u201d said Ian Stewart, chief economist at accountants Deloitte.\n\nBritain\u2019s economy shrank in the second quarter of the year, driven by a sharp decline in April when businesses found themselves holding unnecessary stockpiles of raw materials after Brexit was delayed from the original date of March 29.\n\nFILE PHOTO: British port police patrol as the largest container ship in world, CSCL Globe, docks during its maiden voyage, at the port of Felixstowe in south east England, January 7, 2015.

Businesses say a no-deal Brexit risks causing major disruption to imports.\n\nTwo consecutive quarters of contraction would mean Britain\u2019s economy met a commonly used definition of recession, but the ONS said the economy would need to shrink by an almost unprecedented 1.5% in September alone for this to happen.\n\nAs well as Brexit, manufacturers across Europe have been hit by a rise in trade tensions between the United States and China which has weighed on growth globally.\n\nThe new managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, warned earlier this week that the world economy was suffering a \u201csynchronised slowdown\u201d.\n\nThe Bank of England predicted last month that Britain\u2019s economy would manage growth of 0.2% in the third quarter, bolstered in part by higher public spending.\n\nBut September IHS Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index data released last week for the private sector pointed to a 0.1% contraction in the third quarter, with businesses reporting that foreign customers were staying away before Brexit.\n\nThe ONS said it had not received any good anecdotal evidence of the effect of Brexit preparations on the economy in August, when the annual rate of growth slowed to 1.1% from 1.3%, matching a seven-year low set in June.\n\n\u201cGrowth increased in the last three months, despite a weak performance across manufacturing, with TV and film production helping to boost the services sector,\u201d ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nSoft global demand was hurting demand for manufactured exports, the ONS added, and growth in the dominant services industry slowed to zero in the month of August alone.\n\nAugust trade data also released on Thursday showed Britain\u2019s goods trade deficit widened slightly to 9.8 billion pounds from 9.6 billion pounds in July, versus Reuters poll forecasts of 10.0 billion pounds.\n\nBritain\u2019s total trade deficit for goods and services narrowed slightly to 1.5 billion pounds from 1.7 billion.", "description": "Britain's sluggish economy looks to have dodged recession in the run-up to its deadline for leaving the European Union this month, official data showed on Thursday.", "authors": ["David Milliken", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439221330&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990M0", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
