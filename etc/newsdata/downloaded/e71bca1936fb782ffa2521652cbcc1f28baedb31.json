Brown agreed to a deal with the New England Patriots, according to multiple reports, giving Tom Brady, Bill Belichick and the reigning champions one of the game\u2019s best\u2014and temperamental\u2014talents.\n\nBrown, who tweeted a picture of himself in a Pats uniform, could follow in the footsteps of Randy Moss, the Hall of Fame receiver who revitalized his career in New England catching passes from Brady. But having clashed with his last two teams, Brown could just as easily be on a collision course for more trouble with Belichick, the NFL\u2019s premier no-nonsense coach who\u2019s taking a chance on yet another mercurial personality.\n\nThe move caps one of the craziest NFL offseasons in memory. In the stretch of a few months, Brown was traded from the Pittsburgh Steelers to Oakland, where he signed a giant new contract; immediately became embroiled in a series of conflicts that resulted in his release; and then resurfaced with the NFL\u2019s ruling dynasty.\n\nBrown had publicly asked for his release earlier in the day on social media, after posting a video to YouTube on Friday night that contained the audio of an apparent conversation with Raiders coach Jon Gruden, in which the coach pleaded with the player to quit his antics and just play football.\n\n\u201cHow hard is that?\u201d Gruden said on the video.\n\nApparently for Brown, that was too hard after his spat with the team had escalated in recent days over fines he had been issued over missing team activities. Those disagreements\u2014and the broader implications of the fines, which may have removed any financial guarantees from his contract\u2014precipitated his release.\n\nThe moves likely cost Brown tens of millions of dollars. But the antics also forced his exit from a team with little hope of competing this year, and gave him the freedom to sign with one of this year\u2019s favorites.\n\nAfter a month of nonstop drama, it\u2019s clear why the Patriots would want Brown. For the better part of the past decade, he has been arguably the premier wide receiver in football. Over the last six seasons, no player has recorded as many receiving yards as Brown did with the Steelers. But when tensions boiled over in Pittsburgh\u2014which included him missing the final game of the season\u2014that relationship came to an end. After the season was over, the Steelers traded him to the Raiders, a team famous for off-the-field drama and taking risks on highly-talented but potentially troubled players.\n\nOakland gave Brown a new contract and saw him as the great hope to revitalize a moribund offense, but they were about to find about why it cost so little\u2014just middle-round draft picks\u2014to get him.\n\nWhen Brown arrived at the team\u2019s training camp via hot air balloon, after a summer of viral workouts across the globe to get in shape for the season, he had a grisly foot injury because of an apparent cryotherapy treatment gone awry. That kept him out of practice, and soon another issue popped up: Brown wasn\u2019t happy that his preferred helmet was no longer approved because of safety reasons, according to rules established by the NFL and NFL Players Association designed to protect players.\n\nBrown filed a grievance over the helmet issue and lost. He filed another grievance and lost that one, too. He also missed some time with the team while he stewed over the issue, which precipitated the problems that would lead to the downfall of his relationship with the team. The Raiders issued Brown a letter with more than $50,000 of fines for his violations, which a discontented Brown posted on social media.\n\nThat led to a reported confrontation between Brown and Mike Mayock, the team\u2019s general manager. After that, there were signs that the relationship would finally end when he didn\u2019t practice with the team on Thursday.\n\nBut there was a brief interlude when it all seemed like it could get smoothed over. By Friday, Brown had returned to the team and publicly apologized. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited about that,\u201d Gruden said then, \u201cand ready to move on.\u201d\n\nThat lasted just a few hours. Later on Friday night, Brown posted his conversation with Gruden on YouTube. That gave the Raiders a window to void the nearly $30 million guaranteed on his contract. By Saturday morning, Brown asked for his release. The Raiders granted it.\n\nNow, the question is how he will fare\u2014and act\u2014in New England. Moss proved to be a brilliant partner with Brady, and the Patriots have continued taking those types of projects on since.\n\nLast year, they added Josh\u2019s Gordon from the Browns, who was productive\u2014before receiving another suspension from the league.\n\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com", "description": "Brown\u2019s deal with the New England Patriots came on the same day that the Oakland Raiders released the star wide receiver.
