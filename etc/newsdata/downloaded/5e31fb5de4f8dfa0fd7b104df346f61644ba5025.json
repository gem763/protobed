He recalled: \u201cAt about three or four in the afternoon, the bottom window blew out and the wind tried to pull my family outside. I was holding my wife\u2019s hand and she was holding our son\u2019s hand; they were off their feet and in the air for at least 10 minutes. My arm still hurts. We went to the bathroom and the whole roof came off. I was as scared as hell. I thought I was going to die.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Italian bistro that Dames opened last year was destroyed by the storm and now he does not know what his future holds \u2013 or where it will be. \u201cWe put a lot of work into it and it\u2019s gone, just like that. Now I\u2019m going to start my whole life over. Start at the bottom,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHis wife, Martha, 40, took their traumatized 11-year-old son Antwoine to Nassau, the Bahamian capital. But on Tuesday Dames was at the local airport awaiting delivery of supplies including food, water and batteries. He said there is a plan to rebuild Treasure Cay, but he is waiting to see what terms he is offered before making a decision.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A view of stranded boats in a devastated marina after Hurricane Dorian hit the Abaco Islands in Treasure Cay, on 7 September. Photograph: Marco Bello/Reuters\n\nTwenty miles north of Abaco\u2019s biggest town, Marsh Harbour, Treasure Cay boasts a luxury resort with a beach rated one of the best in the world. The rich own second homes here and there are golf courses and tennis courts. One tennis net is twisted but still up and many beachfront villas survived Dorian relatively unscathed. It is still possible to stand on their decks overlooking the turquoise ocean and imagine paradise.\n\n\n\nBut as another plane load of people departed Treasure Cay\u2019s modest airport, the daunting, multi-year, multibillion-dollar challenge of how to rebuild \u2013 and even whether to rebuild \u2013 Abaco and other affected Bahamian islands is looming large.\n\n\n\nJim Keady, an American volunteering for the Humanitarian Aid and Rescue Project, said: \u201cThis is just as bad as any war zone that one might see. Everywhere you walk into communities that were hardest hit, you can smell death.\u201d\n\nA collapsed bridge in Abaco. Photograph: David Smith\n\nTraveling with the NGO Team Rubicon UK on Tuesday, the Guardian witnessed how a major bridge had collapsed into an inlet, plunging giant chunks of concrete below water and twisting steel barriers out of shape. In the surrounding area vehicles have been spun upside down, trees broken like twigs and power cables snapped.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the Cooper\u2019s Town community clinic, Keady, 47, commented: \u201cThe infrastructure is completely clobbered. All the electricity has gone, the water\u2019s gone and the other thing is that the people are gone. You have so many people who have left the island that we now have another wave of climate refugees.\n\n\n\n\u201cI did a ride around yesterday with one of the top guys at the ministry of works here just processing what will need to be done: the amount of front-end loaders, bulldozers, mulching machines, cranes. There\u2019s going to have to be some really difficult decisions made by the central government here in the Bahamas on whether or not you rebuild. From what I have seen, you\u2019ve just got to bulldoze a lot of these neighborhoods and then decide, are we going to rebuild something here?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A stranded sailboat is seen after Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas in Treasure Cay, on 7 September Photograph: Marco Bello/Reuters\n\nKeady suggested that the situation will become unsustainable for residents in seven to 10 days, especially if aid dries up, making evacuation the only option.\n\n\n\n\u201cI just came from the airport in Treasure Cay. A plane landed, we were unloading medical supplies and there were people running up with their passports begging to get on a plane to anywhere in Florida. And you have to tell them no. It breaks your heart. You\u2019ve got a mother in tears crying for herself and her son, \u2018I just want to get him out of here.\u2019 This is the reality facing people here.\u201d\n\n\n\nKeady, who has been involved in local politics in New Jersey, insisted that global heating was a crucial factor in the category 5 hurricane.\n\n\u201cThe surface temperatures of the water are so much higher than they would have been and that\u2019s just fuel for storms that in the past would have moved along and did some damage. We had a storm stall for two days, crushing the Bahamas,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is a fool with regard to the climate crisis. You don\u2019t have to be a climate scientist; you just need to be paying attention and looking at what is happening.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlthough much of Abaco is eerily deserted, and the Treasure Cay community centre lies dark and silent with rows of books and a calendar frozen in August, there is a slow trickle of people into the next door medical centre, where volunteers from Heart to Heart International are providing free treatment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boxes of meals ready-to-eat (MRE) are seen at an airport during an evacuation operation after Hurricane Dorian hit the Abaco Islands in Treasure Cay, on 7 September. Photograph: Marco Bello/Reuters\n\nWilson Charite, 61, who came to the clinic because of his blood pressure, said of the hurricane: \u201cMy house was flooded. The water broke the front door and carried everything out. We had one little ladder inside so we put all the children on the roof.\n\n\n\n\u201cEveryone was crying. I said: \u2018Don\u2019t cry, the roof isn\u2019t going to go away.\u2019 I thought, if the roof goes, all my children will be lost.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis daughter, Wilsonithe, 14, added: \u201cWe were on the roof for a night. The house was shaking. It was like the house was going to tumble over. I felt like I was going to die.\u201d\n\n\n\nClint Laroda, 60, required attention to his hand after trying to ride out the storm in a beach club. \u201cI was opening the door to get my family out and the hurricane slammed the door and amputated the tip of my finger,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBut he remains optimistic about the future of Treasure Cay. \u201cI think it can be rebuilt. I\u2019m a builder, so I\u2019m not going to say no.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn nearby Cooper\u2019s Town, a roadside sign says innocently: \u201cWe hope your stay was a very pleasant one.\u201d\n\nA church, library and school appear to have emerged relatively unscathed. Anthony Saunders, 58, who was fixing up his convenience store and petrol station, said he was hopeful the town water supply would be switched on tomorrow. \u201cThey\u2019re good people here. They\u2019re resilient. It will take time but it will come back.\u201d", "description": "Twenty miles north of Abaco\u2019s biggest town, Treasure Cay faces the daunting challenge of recovery and clean-up after the hurricane left it looking like a \u2018war zone\u2019", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eefe383ac252d564b10ad3eccf66f7d77ed69116/0_257_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0e823828880a6af565a4b556abecb56c", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
