Despite the carnage, the White House announced that American commandos quickly confirmed Baghdadi\u2019s identity by combining facial-recognition technology and fast DNA analysis.\n\nThe near-instant forensic analysis appears to be a dramatic demonstration of new capabilities U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) developed in part to address ambiguities that resulted from the commando raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011.\n\nMost importantly, a new, smaller and much faster DNA-reader that troops can haul into combat aboard their helicopters and use while the smoke from combat is still clearing.\n\nActing on fresh intelligence regarding Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts, U.S. forces based in northern Iraqi piled into helicopters and, as President Trump announced, flew \u201cvery, very low and very, very fast\u201d to Idlib in western Syria.\n\nAs the Americans cleared Baghdadi\u2019s compound, killing what Trump described as \u201ca number\u201d of ISIS fighters, Baghdadi himself fled into a tunnel with three of his children. \u201cHe reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down,\u201d Trump noted in a rambling press conference on Sunday.\n\nISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed \u2018Whimpering and Crying\u2019 in U.S.-Syria Raid: Trump\n\n\u201cHe ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cHis body was mutilated by the blast. The tunnel had caved in on it. But test results gave certain immediate and totally positive identification. It was him.\u201d\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s head reportedly remained intact following the blast. Using a biometric facial-recognition scanner, the Americans \u201cimmediately identified\u201d Baghdadi, Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin reported.\n\nSince the early days of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, U.S. forces have built up huge databases of terror suspects\u2019 faces, iris patterns and fingerprints, and used an ever-improving series of handheld scanners to match detainees with suspects\u2019 profiles. Most recently, the U.S. Army began studying ways of gathering \u201cvoiceprints\u201d in order to identify terrorists by the sound of their voices.\n\nThe commandos in the Baghdadi raid didn\u2019t just rely on these biometric signatures to confirm the target\u2019s identity. The White House in a statement said, \u201ca combination of visual evidence and DNA tests confirmed Baghdadi\u2019s identity.\u201d\n\nUntil recently, a conclusive DNA test could take weeks as analysts at a laboratory dissolved organic samples in special reagent chemicals, sifted out waste materials in order to isolate the DNA then copied the strands in order to produce an easily-readable baseline.\n\nThe U.S. Defense Department has worked hard in recent years to speed up DNA processing, specifically in order to quickly identify terror leaders who might not survive swift, violent commando raids.\n\nShortly after U.S. Navy SEALs killed bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011, American officials delivered a sample of the terror leader\u2019s remains to a U.S. military DNA lab in Afghanistan, The Washington Post reported. There, military specialists confirmed bin Laden\u2019s identity. The chance of an error was \u201capproximately one in 11.8 quadrillion,\u201d an intelligence official told the newspaper.\n\nBut Pentagon leaders wanted Special Operations Forces to be able to identify terrorists on the spot in the heady hours following a raid\u2014no time-consuming shipments to DNA labs required.\n\nIn 2015, SOCOM officials revealed that commandos had begun using two new types of a small and portable DNA lab: the RapidHIT 200 from California-based IntegenX and the DNAscan from NetBIO in Massachusetts.\n\nThe two DNA-readers work like the bigger, traditional laboratory-based systems do, but with very small, precisely measured quantities of chemicals and a wireless connection to a DNA database. Both new readers weigh around 100 pounds and are the size of a copy machine, making them small enough to fit on a helicopter.\n\nThey both require just one, moderately-trained operator. Use a cotton swab to soak up some spit or blood, slip the swab into a plastic sleeve, insert the sleeve into the machine and press a few buttons. Less than two hours later, the machine spits out a strip of paper listing any matches.", "description": "Pfc.
