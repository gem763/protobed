(AP) - Packers coach Matt LaFleur remembers vividly how challenging it was facing Mike Zimmer\u2019s defense.\n\nZimmer\u2019s defensive unit held LaFleur\u2019s offense to a single touchdown when the two squared off nearly two years ago in Minnesota. Zimmer was 10 games into what would eventually be a 13-3 season with an appearance in the NFC championship game for him in his fourth season as Vikings head coach. LaFleur was enjoying his first and only season as offensive coordinator for the Rams, who would finish 11-5 and lose in the wild-card round.\n\nThe two will square off again Sunday when LaFleur and the Packers welcome Zimmer\u2019s Vikings to Lambeau Field.\n\n\u201cIt certainly is going to be a good task for our offense and a good measuring stick to see where we\u2019re at, see how much we can improve from last week,\u201d LaFleur said Monday.\n\nLaFleur\u2019s offense managed just one touchdown in a 10-3 win last week against Chicago, which boasts one of the top defenses in the league. The 10 points tied for the fewest Green Bay has scored against the Bears since Rodgers became the starting quarterback in 2008. LaFleur said he anticipates another tough chess match when he sees Zimmer on the opposite sideline on Sunday.\n\n\u201cHe stresses you,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cHe presents a lot of similar looks, and they do a lot of different things off of those looks. Then you combine that with the talent they have, and again on all three levels of that defense, they\u2019ve got Pro Bowlers everywhere.\u201d\n\nLaFleur, play-caller and head coach Sean McVay, quarterback Jared Goff and the Rams\u2019 offense opened the game on Nov. 18, 2017, in Minnesota with a nine-play, 70-yard drive. The drive was capped by a 6-yard rushing touchdown by Todd Gurley. Los Angeles never scored again.\n\nLaFleur and the Rams ended with 179 yards on their final nine drives and lost 24-7.\n\nThe Vikings hired Zimmer in January 2014 after allowing the second-most yards and the most points in the NFL during the 2013 season. Zimmer had spent the previous five seasons as the Bengals defensive coordinator. Zimmer directed Cincinnati to a top-10 finish in yards and points allowed in four of his five seasons.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s defense, led by linebacker Anthony Barr, started the season by getting four sacks and forcing three turnovers in a 28-12 win over the Falcons.\n\nA challenge LaFleur will face on Sunday that he didn\u2019t have to worry about against Zimmer\u2019s Vikings two seasons ago was Dalvin Cook.\n\nThe third-year running back missed 12 games as a rookie in 2017 with a torn ACL and five more games last season with a hamstring issue. But Cook was ready for the opener Sunday, carrying the ball 21 times for 111 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nCook, who earned his third 100-yard outing in his 16th game, gives a new dimension to the Vikings\u2019 offense, an offense that is all too familiar to LaFleur.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re watching the tape and you\u2019re watching Minnesota\u2019s offense, you can see a lot of similar concepts,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 There\u2019s a lot of similarities between what they do and some of the stuff that we do.\u201d\n\nWhat the Vikings did well against the Falcons and also two years ago was run the ball. Latavius Murray led Minnesota with 95 yards and two scores on the ground against LaFleur and the Rams in 2017.\n\nLaFleur has emphasized since Day 1 of his tenure in Green Bay is the importance of establishing the run. The 47 rushing yards the Packers\u2019 offense had last week won\u2019t be enough against the Vikings and LaFleur knows it.\n\n\u201cAs an offense, everybody needs to be better,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd again, it starts with the coaches, myself and the offensive coaches.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Packers coach Matt LaFleur remembers vividly how challenging it was facing Mike Zimmer's defense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/packers_bears_football_71255_c0-365-3923-2652_s1770x1032.jpg?8c7e74f568e0a6bced92f7b260689bb7bb0587e1", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
