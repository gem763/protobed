(Oct. 9) AP Domestic\n\nStory Highlights Two people have died in an attack German authorities are calling anti-Semitic.\n\nA heavily armed suspect fired shots outside a synagogue and into a kebab bistro, authorities say.\n\nA local Jewish community leader said a man tried to break into the synagogue.\n\nA \"heavily armed\" gunman killed two people and tried to force his way into an eastern German synagogue Wednesday on Yom Kippur in what German authorities called an anti-Semitic attack.\n\nThe suspect live-streamed the attacks in the eastern German city of Halle with a helmet-mounted camera, according to media reports.\n\nGerman Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said the \"heavily armed perpetrator\" was arrested. Prosecutors said they believe the attack had far-right motives.\n\nThe German news magazine Der Spiegel described the suspect as a 27-year-old, identified only as Stephan B., from the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, where Halle is located.\n\nThe news magazine, without citing sources, said the video shows the assailant shooting a passerby near a Jewish cemetery and a customer in a kebab bistro near the synagogue.\n\nRita Katz, director of the U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist and white supremacist organizations, said on Twitter that 35 minutes of head-mounted camera footage of the shooting was posted on a video game site. Katz said the gunman says in English just before the shooting: \"The root of all problems are the Jews.\"\n\nYom Kippur, or the Day of Atonement, is the holiest day of the year when Jews fast for more than 24 hours.\n\nThe head of Halle\u2019s Jewish community, Max Privorotzki, told Der Spiegel that a camera at the entrance of the synagogue showed a person trying to break into the building.\n\n\u201cThe assailant shot several times at the door and also threw several Molotov cocktails, firecrackers or grenades to force his way in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the door remained closed \u2014 God protected us. The whole thing lasted perhaps five to 10 minutes.\u201d\n\nPrivorotzki said there were 70 or 80 people inside the synagogue when the shooting occurred.\n\nAt the kebab shop near the synagogue, a witness interviewed on n-tv television said a gunman opened fire there too. It's unclear where the two victims were shot and if there are multiple suspects.\n\nA video clip broadcast by regional public broadcaster MDR and posted on Twitter shows a gunman stepping from a vehicle, firing his weapon, walking behind the car and then firing three more times.\n\nA synagogue visitor talks to police after a shooting at a synagogue in Halle, Germany, October 9, 2019. According to the police two people were killed in shootings in front of a Synagogue and a Kebab shop in the Paulus district of Halle in the East German federal state of Saxony-Anhalt. Police stated a suspect is already in arrest. Media report the mayor of Halle speaks of an amok situation.

Roessler said the man then shot into the shop at least once.\n\n\u201cAll the customers next to me ran, of course I did too \u2013 I think there were five or six of us in there,\u201d Roessler said. \u201cThe man behind me probably died.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hid in the toilet,\u201d he said. \u201cThe others looked for the back entrance. I didn\u2019t know if there was one. I locked myself quietly in this toilet, and wrote to my family that I love them, and waited for something to happen.\u201d\n\nPolice then came into the shop, he said.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, lamented what he called \u201cterrible news from Halle,\u201d but government officials said they had no information on the attack.\n\nPhotos from the scene showed a body lying in the street behind a police cordon.\n\nHalle, a city of 240,000 residents in eastern Germany, is about 80 miles southwest of Berlin. The German national railway shut down the local station following the shooting.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/09/halle-german-synagogue-shooting-two-dead-one-arrested/3917035002/", "description": "In Halle, Germany, two people were killed and a suspect is in custody in a shooting near a synagogue that authorities describe as anti-Semitic.", "authors": ["Doug Stanglin", "Published A.M.
