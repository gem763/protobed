That involves securing its licence \u2013 \"we suspect the licence will be fine\" \u2013 but comes as a lot is happening within Wynn.\n\nInevitably, it has been touted as a potential target.\n\n\"They do have great assets, always best of class, so one of the things people have been waiting for is to get through the uncertainty of the Boston licence,\" Mr Bertoli said. \"Once that overhang is removed, they become a target for others, and this may have a been a slightly defensive strategy \u2013 make yourself bigger.\"\n\nPendal Group's Ashley Pittard believes the Crown assets are almost of the calibre of Wynn's, making Crown's properties a natural fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Crown is a world-class monopoly or duopoly asset in the definition of the word,\" he said. \"It's a duopoly because no one else can provide table games, shows and conventions all in one place. It's still a destination.\"\n\nIf Wynn is the Ritz-Carlton, Crown is the Intercontinental, the fund manager suggested.\n\nA global footprint would enable Wynn to package all its casinos \"in a way that makes it easy for time-poor, wealthy Chinese gamblers. Most people like a standardised type approach, they make it easy.\"\n\nWith the benefit of cheap funding available to Wynn in the US market and an advantageous Australian dollar, a deal could work. Further, \"if they have to pay a large premium to get their new licences in Macau, then they would have the backing of the stable cash flows from Crown,\" Mr Pittard said.\n\n\"It was speculated that James Packer wanted to own a truly global business. Under the deal with Wynn, he would have been the largest individual shareholder.\"\n\nMr Packer owns 46.1 per cent of Crown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Wynn, the ex-wife of Mr Wynn (whose resignation was linked to alleged sexual misconduct, which he denies), is the biggest individual name on Wynn's register (Vanguard is the largest shareholder). Macau operator Galaxy Entertainment, which owns almost 5 per cent, acquired its shares last year at the time Mr Wynn sold his personal stake.\n\nIt is not just demographic change that has led casinos to Macau, where Wynn gets the majority of its earnings today. Return on capital in Las Vegas is depressed because there are so many casinos.\n\nWith Boston complete, Wynn is about to enter a period of dazzling free cash flow because its immediate capital expenditure plans are exhausted. Japan is another focus for Wynn, but not in the near-term.\n\n\"The question is, what do they do with that cash?\" Mr Bertoli said. \"A dividend has always been something investors look to because the Wynn dividend is lower than Las Vegas Sands. The question around [mergers and acquisitions] is always there, but that's never been something the market's focused on with Wynn because of their organic growth preference.\"\n\nCrown offered \"great assets\", but \"it's coming at a time of increased macro uncertainty and more competition\", he said.\n\n\"The international business that Crown has benefited from in the past is becoming much more competitive. There's significantly more alternatives \u2013 high-quality alternatives \u2013 and it becomes a tax arbitrage game for the VIP high-roller play,\" Mr Bertoli said.\n\n\"From Wynn's perspective, I don't think they'd be running away with the business cheaply at $14.75.\"\n\nThat figure was disclosed by Crown as the value of the cash-and-stock offer proposed by Wynn before it walked away, citing premature disclosure.", "description": "It's no bargain, but any deal to secure Crown would represent a different path for the Las Vegas casino group as it sets course without Steve Wynn's vision.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_93/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cd131cb725403390b140795da5326ad34b7029c6", "published_at": "2019-04-10"}
