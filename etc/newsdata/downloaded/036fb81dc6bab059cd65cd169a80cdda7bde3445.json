Her bodyguard, Rani Sa\u00efdi, who was present in court, was handed an eight-month suspended sentence and fined \u20ac5,000. Neither is expected to serve any time in jail.\n\nEmmanuel Moyne, a lawyer for Princess Hassa, said the princess would appeal the ruling. A person close to the Saudi royal family denied that the princess ordered a beating, saying she merely asked the bodyguard to stop the workman from taking photographs in her apartment.\n\nThe verdict comes as the Saudi royal family and Prince Mohammed struggle to overcome damage to their reputation after last year\u2019s gruesome killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The CIA concluded the prince himself likely ordered the killing. The Saudi government says Saudi operatives killed him on their own initiative in a \u201crogue operation,\u201d and Saudi prosecutors have charged 11 people in his death.\n\nAfter the killing, Prince Mohammed sought to rehabilitate his image, attending the Group of 20 summit late last year in Argentina, traveling on diplomatic missions to Asia and funding a youth conference with the United Nations. Yet he continues to face criticism from human-rights groups and Western governments over Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\nPrincess Hassa was charged with ordering the beating during a visit by the worker, Ashraf Eid, for repairs to her apartment on Avenue Foch, an upscale address near the Arc de Triomphe where wealthy foreigners often buy real estate. The princess became enraged after she thought Mr. Eid was surreptitiously trying to photograph her, French prosecutors said.\n\nAfter being summoned by the princess, her bodyguard tied up Mr. Eid, beat him, put a gun to his head and ordered him to kiss her feet, Mr. Eid said. At one point Princess Hassa said, \u201cKill him, the dog, he doesn\u2019t deserve to live,\u201d Mr. Eid told the police.\n\nYassine Bouzrou, a lawyer for the bodyguard, Mr. Sa\u00efdi, said his client sought only to protect his employer. He said Mr. Sa\u00efdi ran over upon hearing the princess shout for help and firmly pushed back the assailant.\n\nMr. Bouzrou said his client denies threatening the man with a weapon, tying him up, or forcing him to kiss the princess\u2019s feet.\n\nWrite to Matthew Dalton at Matthew.Dalton@wsj.com and Noemie Bisserbe at noemie.bisserbe@wsj.com", "description": "A French court convicted the sister of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of ordering her bodyguard to assault a workman who said he was beaten in her luxury apartment and forced to kiss the princess\u2019s feet.", "authors": ["Matthew Dalton", "Noemie Bisserbe", "Matthew.Dalton Wsj.Com", "Noemie.Bisserbe Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106612/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
