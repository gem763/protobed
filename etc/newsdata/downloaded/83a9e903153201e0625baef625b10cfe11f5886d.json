Liontrust UK Ethical has proved otherwise.\n\nSince launch in 1999, it\u2019s returned 304pc, far higher than the FTSE All Share\u2019s 170pc. The \u00a3506m fund has been with Liontrust since 2017, having transferred from Alliance Trust Investments. Peter Michaelis manages the portfolio alongside Neil Brown and his team also run the firm\u2019s \u201csustainable future\u201d range.\n\nHe told Telegraph Money why he is buying more British companies ahead of Brexit and what makes him different from Neil Woodford.\n\nHow do you choose stocks?\n\nWe follow a detailed process which has been refined. We start off by looking for companies benefiting from changes in society, like the move towards a low-carbon economy, digital security or companies involved in healthier eating.\n\nThen we look at how well managed those companies are, apply ethical principles to them and decide how sustainable their growth is before investing in the best ones.\n\nWhat makes you different from your rivals?\n\nWe\u2019re not just buying environmental technology stocks or healthcare companies. We look for businesses that are benefiting from changes in the whole economy.\n\nOur team has a lot of experience and the fund has been going since 1999. Over the past 20 years we\u2019ve learned how to improve the way we select stocks.", "description": "It\u2019s an investment clich\u00e9 that you can be ethical with your money or you can get returns, but not both.", "authors": ["Sam Meadows", "Katie Morley", "Lauren Davidson", "Taha Lokhandwala"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/investing/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000213989242-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqIkUhv7k5mil0w0oeVCztIhVrDwi3LvLa62XQyE1Z5U4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
