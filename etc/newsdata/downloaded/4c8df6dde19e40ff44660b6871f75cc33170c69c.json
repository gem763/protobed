He concedes that he was there and part of it. He says he didn't actually butcher it,' Ms MacCarron said.\n\nShe also said he didn't want anything more to do with his accomplices.\n\nOne of the witnesses said he had never seen an act of such cruelty to a defenseless animal (stock image)\n\nSpencer had already spent 33 days in in prison for failing to appear in court in December last year.\n\nMs MacCarron argued sending Spencer back to jail would be futile because it was his first offence in years.\n\nJudge Elizabeth Morris sentenced the man to 150 hours of community service.\n\nWood and Young also pleaded guilty to stealing, but charges against Petherick were dropped after it emerged he was charged outside the six-month time limit.\n\nWood was sentenced to three months jail in September.\n\nJudge Elisabeth Armitage said at Wood's trial that the incident was 'very different than the normal stealing that comes before this court'.", "description": "One of his co-offenders (pictured) could be heard yelling 'i want meat, I want meat' as the group drove to butcher the defenseless animal.", "authors": ["Charlotte Karp For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/03/19468034-0-image-a-2_1570586434372.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
