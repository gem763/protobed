Roger Bannister\u2019s 3:59.4. Usain Bolt\u2019s 9.58. And now Eliud Kipchoge\u2019s 1:59:40.\n\nKipchoge\u2019s extraordinary sub-two-hour marathon in Vienna on Saturday is one of the greatest sporting achievements \u2013 recording a time that has never been achieved before and pushing the limits of human ability, again. It is a time on the fringes of what scientists believe is humanly possible.\n\nAnd yet record-breaking events such as Kipchoge\u2019s seem increasingly common. Last week Simone Biles became the first female gymnast to win a fifth world all-around title, using two signature moves that no other woman has ever achieved.\n\nSarah Thomas swam the English channel four times in a row, 134 miles (215km) in open seas in 54 hours. Dalilah Muhammad broke the 400m hurdles world record twice this year and Sifan Hassan did the same for the 5km and one mile events. In men\u2019s athletics, Geoffrey Kamworor is waiting to hear if his half marathon time of 58:01 will be ratified, while Julien Wanders set a new 5km record in February. And don\u2019t forget the nine men\u2019s swimming world records Adam Peaty and others have set this year. So far.\n\n\u201cIt is a great feeling to make history in sport after Sir Roger Bannister in 1954,\u201d Kipchoge said afterwards, predicting that others would repeat the feat. \u201cI am the happiest man in the world to be the first human to run under two hours and I can tell people that no human is limited.\u201d\n\nIs he right? Where are the limits of human ability? And how close are we to reaching them?\n\nSports scientists generally agree there are theoretical limits. Michael Joyner, a marathon runner and physiologist, published a paper in 1991 examining the three defining elements of a distance runner: VO 2 max, the maximum amount of oxygen a body can take on; running economy, the rate at which the body uses energy; and lactate threshold, the amount of effort a body can maintain before it releases lactic acid \u2013 the burn.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest US gymnast Simone Biles became the first female gymnast to win a fifth world all-around title. Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nJoyner\u2019s calculations predicted that the fastest time anyone would ever be able to run a marathon would be 1:57:58. And a paper this year estimated that human endurance for the fittest athletes was ultimately limited by their metabolisms. An amateur sprint relay team ran a marathon last year in 200m bursts, and they took 1hr 30.\n\nRaph Brandon, head of science for England cricket, distinguishes between feats which are constrained by human anatomy, and those which require human determination or skill.\n\n\u201cWhen Bolt ran 9.58 in Berlin 10 years ago, if you analyse the split times, it\u2019s very hard to imagine where the improvement comes from,\u201d said Brandon, who worked with Team GB through three Olympic games until 2014. \u201cThe Usain Bolt 100m or the two-hour marathon, they\u2019re in that category.\u201d\n\nMulti-day, ultra-endurance events, such as Thomas\u2019s cross-Channel swim, are different, Brandon said.\n\n\u201cThey need grit, psychology and bloody-mindedness to go that little bit further. Those people will continue to do unique things because you\u2019re not really taking the body to its anatomical limit, it\u2019s more a question of how much you\u2019re prepared to deplete and fatigue yourself.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s a third category, those sporting endeavours that rely on hand-eye coordination: the goal tallies of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, the tennis grand slams of Roger Federer and Serena Williams, and the batting of Virat Kohli, Steve Smith or Don Bradman, who trained by hitting a golf ball with a stump against a wall to become the best batsman ever to play Test cricket.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to put the right kind of hours in,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cBradman\u2019s [golf ball is] a nice example. It\u2019s something that overloads your perception and movement control so you can cope with more and more types of delivery bowler and pitch condition. But there are physiological limits to that as well.\u201d\n\nWhat you see now is little peak points that might be related to equipment, coaching or technology Gary Brickley, sports scientist\n\nIn some sports, far from setting new records, the limit seems to have been reached. The fastest ever baseball pitch was tracked at 105.1mph in 2010, and hasn\u2019t been beaten. Then, only a few pitchers threw the ball so fast; now it\u2019s commonplace \u2013 but no one has thrown faster. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced there is a big increase in world records,\u201d said Gary Brickley, a sports scientist at Brighton University. \u201cWhat you see is little peak points which might be related to some intervention, whether that\u2019s equipment or drugs or coaching, or some technological means of making someone go faster.\u201d\n\nEquipment has been a factor for many sports. NFL receivers wear gloves that enable them to make improbable one-handed catches. Football boots have been designed to help players put exactly the right amount of spin on the ball ever since Adidas launched the Predator boot. The GB cycling team swept the board at the Olympics because of their amazing new clothing tech.\n\nThe line between what is fair and unfair is blurry. Kipchoge\u2019s sub-two-hour run will not be officially recognised \u2013 he still holds the official record of 2:01:39 \u2013 because he had so much help. The Kenyan ran behind a car which beamed a green laser on to the ground in front of him. Teams of pacemakers, 41 in total, ran in a V-formation to shield him from headwinds. He wore specially designed shoes and the time and date of the event were picked \u2013 by the organiser Ineos, the chemical company owned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Britain\u2019s richest man \u2013 only after detailed weather forecasting.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sarah Thomas recovers after her epic 215km swim \u2013 four times across the channel.

His first attempt in 1953 was ruled out because his pacemaker, Chris Brasher \u2013 who went on to found the London Marathon \u2013 ran the first two laps slowly so that he could set a fast pace in the final half of the race. His record-breaking race might have gone the same way, according to Bannister\u2019s other pacemaker, Chris Chataway, who wrote in 2003 that the publicity after the event meant the athletics authorities \u201cdid not have the temerity to question whether Brasher and I had been bona fide competitors. Of course we were not. But we did not flaunt the fact.\u201d\n\nThe question of assistance is not simply nit-picking, according to Ross Tucker, a sports scientist, who said when he first heard about Kipchoge\u2019s attempt he wondered if they should run downhill, followed by a truck with giant fans to generate a tailwind.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s gimmicky to the point of annoying,\u201d he said on the Science of Sport podcast last week. \u201cBut you had to do something to sidestep the normal physiological limit because these limits are not broken that much in one go.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the final limit is inside athlete\u2019s heads. Jo Davies, a sport psychologist, says recent studies have shown athletes can push themselves harder because of their perception of exhaustion. \u201cIt\u2019s how we interpret pain or discomfort \u2013 does this mean I need to slow down, this is too much, or does it mean \u2018this tells me I\u2019m on track \u2013 it\u2019s meant to be hard\u2019.\u201d\n\nOther research published this year which looked at super-elite athletes \u2013 who had won multiple gold medals \u2013 found that they were different in several important ways. They had often had a traumatic life experience and had suffered significant setbacks in their performance during their careers, as well as personality traits of ruthlessness, perseverance and perfectionism.\n\nSo whether or not those limits have been reached, there will be no shortage of people prepared to try to go beyond them.\n\nRECORDS TO BEAT\n\nUSAIN BOLT, sprinter.
