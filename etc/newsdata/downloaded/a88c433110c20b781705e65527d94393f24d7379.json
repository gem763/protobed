And he spoke,\u201d James said before his Los Angeles Lakers played the Golden State Warriors at Staple Center.\n\nIn his first public comments on the controversy, the NBA\u2019s biggest star told reporters prior to Monday\u2019s preseason game that \u201cwe do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so many people could have been harmed not only financially, physically, emotionally, spiritually,\u201d James said. \u201cSo just be careful what we tweet and say and we do, even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.\u201d\n\nHis comments were met immediately with backlash on social media from critics who accused him of kowtowing to China. State-controlled Chinese television and sponsors reacted to Morey\u2019s Oct. 4 tweet with a boycott of the Rockets.\n\n\u201cYes, Morey supported freedom so he isn\u2019t \u2018educated on the situation,\u2019 that\u2019s it,\u201d tweeted conservative pundit Dana Loesch.\n\nYes, Morey supported freedom so he isn\u2019t \u201ceducated on the situation,\u201d that\u2019s it https://t.co/6QjQBMudJy \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) October 15, 2019\n\nAsked why he thought Morey was ill-informed, James said, \u201cI believe he was either misinformed or not really educated on the situation, and if he was, then so be it,\u201d according to ESPN. \u201cI have no idea, but that is just my belief.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cBecause when you say things or do things, if you are doing it and you know the people that can be affected by it and the families and individuals and everyone that can be affected by it, sometimes things can be changed as well. And also social media is not always the proper way to go about things as well, but that\u2019s just my belief.\u201d\n\nIs it elitist to point out Daryl Morey went to both Northwestern & MIT, when LeBron calls him uneducated? I feel like that\u2019s a woke twitter move. You have to be ashamed and never mention your degrees. But seriously..I feel as though Morey is profoundly more educated on this. \u2014 Britt McHenry (@BrittMcHenry) October 15, 2019\n\nJames, an outspoken social-justice advocate, also tweeted, \u201cMy team and my league just went through a difficult week,\u201d prompting a flood of sarcastic responses.\n\nLeBron James now claims that he had a \u201cdifficult week\u201d earning millions of dollars to play basketball because someone promoted freedom for Hong Kong@KingJames, do you think the millions of people locked up in China\u2019s communist concentration camps are having a good week? https://t.co/p9pMZ1a2N0 \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 15, 2019\n\nThe NBA initially called the Morey tweet \u201cregrettable,\u201d after which commissioner Adam Silver backpedaled, saying that league officials are \u201cnot apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nReminder that this was the extent of Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet pic.twitter.com/hmSw3M1TaL \u2014 Peter J.
