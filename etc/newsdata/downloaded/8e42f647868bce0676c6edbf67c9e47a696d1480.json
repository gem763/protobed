But she agreed for one reason close to her heart \u2013 women entrepreneurs need to be more visible.\n\n\"The more role models we see out there, the more likely other girls and women look up and say 'hey that could be my calling',\" she said.\n\nTa'eed, together with her husband Collis, co-founded Envato, one of the world's largest marketplaces for digital assets, with revenue surging 16 per cent to $134 million in 2017-18. The couple are ranked fourth on this year's Young Rich List, up from eighth with a $428 million valuation last year, but Ms Ta'eed is one of just nine women among the 103 people on the list. That's one fewer than last year and four less than on the very first Young Rich List back in 2003.\n\nThe 40-year-old entrepreneur, whose great-grandmother built houses at a time when female business owners were very rare, said \"thousands of conversations in families, schools and workplaces around Australia\" would be the main driver of resetting expectations around female entrepreneurship.\n\nShe urged women whose start-ups had failed to speak up too. And while she has a reputation for generous leadership \u2013 even former Envato staff were given a slice of this year's $13 million profit share \u2013 she would like to see \"tyrant\" female founders grab headlines as well.\n\n\"We need approachable women as much as we need hard-edged, tough-as-nails ones. We need successful ones as well as flame-outs,\" she said. \"Every role model normalises the path and makes it clear that this actually isn't a special 'man thing'.", "description": "The Envato co-founder, one of nine women on 2019's list of the self-made wealthy aged under 41, says more women leaders of all kinds are needed as role models.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4981%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_724%2C$y_169/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4624e64ab0e94ba9fa910df4293cae397db7a502", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
