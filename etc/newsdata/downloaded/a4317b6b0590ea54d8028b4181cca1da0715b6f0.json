At the time, the 29-year-old mother was engaged to Colorado rancher Patrick Frazee, who is charged with her murder.\n\nBut there was another woman in Frazee's life -- a former Idaho rodeo queen named Krystal Lee.\n\nCBS News correspondent Nikki Battiste takes viewers inside the investigation to find out what happened to Berreth and pieces together the twisted love triangle that prosecutors say led to her death in an all-new \"'48 Hours': The Murder of Kelsey Berreth\" airing Saturday, October 5 on CBS.\n\n\"48 Hours\" to reveal new details in death of Colorado mom Kelsey Berreth\n\nDuring the probe into Berreth's disappearance, the FBI got a tip that Lee had confided to her best friend, Michelle Stein, that Frazee sought Lee's help in getting rid of his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nStein says on October 22, 2018, Lee told her about a disturbing conversation with Frazee.\n\n\"She was very, very upset, very distraught,\" Stein tells Battiste. \"She had told me \u2013 that he had asked her to take care of his baby mama.\"\n\n\"And so, I was like,\" Stein continues, \"Well, I was in shock at first because who says that? Nobody says that \u2013 so I was like, 'what?' And she said, 'yeah, he asked me \u2013 if I would kill the mother of his baby.\"\n\nStein says she was in shock and disbelief. \"She was bawling. She was crying and extremely upset and scared,\" Stein says.\n\nStein explains she pushed Lee to call authorities, but Lee didn't call and neither did Stein.\n\nLee told authorities Frazee tried to get her to kill Berreth three different times and each time she chickened out. Then, she says, it was Frazee who killed Berreth.\n\nBerreth's body has not been found. Frazee's trial is expected to start later this month.", "description": "Krystal's Lee's best friend tells \"48 Hours\" about a disturbing conversation Lee had with Patrick Frazee, who is charged with killing his fianc\u00e9e Kelsey Berreth", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/09/eca157a8-8431-46cc-bca8-06e4ffd08cdb/thumbnail/1200x630/97e810291841e1b15b20a9e1613d5936/screen-shot-2018-12-09-at-5-38-38-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
