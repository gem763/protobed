Click here for Yahoo News\u2019 2020 tracker]\n\nBiden says he'll accept super-PAC cash after vowing to reject it\n\nIn an interview that will air on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday, former Vice President Joe Biden was pressed about his campaign\u2019s last financial filing with the Federal Election Commission, which showed it has less than $9 million in cash on hand \u2014 putting it well behind the $34 million and $26 million that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, respectively, have in the bank.\n\n\u201cHow do you compete against that?\u201d asked \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d host Norah O\u2019Donnell.\n\n\u201cI just flat beat them,\u201d Biden replied. \u201cWe\u2019re on a course to do extremely well. I\u2019m not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly.\u201d\n\nThe \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview was conducted before the Biden campaign announced, in a reversal, that it would now accept donations from super-PACs. Previously its policy was to refuse them.\n\nBiden\u2019s fundraising situation is precarious because he doesn\u2019t have the same broad base of donor support as some of his rivals. Just 38 percent of the $22 million he raised in the first half of the year came from donations of $200 or less. That is compared with 77 percent from small donors for Sanders and 67 percent for Warren. Donors are allowed to give only $2,800 to each primary candidate, meaning donors who give smaller amounts can donate again, while candidates whose supporters max out early might face trouble later.\n\nKate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, defended the move, saying, \u201cThose who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a marked contrast from April, when both Biden and Bedingfield declared that the campaign would not welcome support from super-PACs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again. To speak to the middle class, we need to reject the super-PAC system,\u201d Biden tweeted. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what this campaign is doing.\u201d\n\nThe campaign manager for Sanders, who has based both of his presidential campaigns around rejecting cash from big-money donors, bashed Biden in an email Friday.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden\u2019s campaign lacks grassroots enthusiasm,\u201d Faiz Shakir wrote in a message to supporters. \u201cIt just does. And racing around the country collecting $2,800 checks isn\u2019t enough. He needs bigger checks. Checks with more zeroes at the end.\u201d\n\nIn January 2018, Biden claimed that he was the one who told Sanders not to accept money from corporate PACs.\n\n\u201cI sat with Bernie,\u201d said Biden in a PBS interview. \u201cI\u2019m the guy that told him, you shouldn\u2019t accept any money from a super-PAC, because people can\u2019t possibly trust you. How will a middle-class guy accept you if you accept money?\u201d\n\nBiden was also asked by O\u2019Donnell whether he still considers himself the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m the frontrunner,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut look, this is a marathon.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump and Joe Biden.

Their actions speak for themselves,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI can just tell you this, that if I\u2019m president, get elected president, my children are not going to have offices in the White House. My children are not going to sit in on Cabinet meetings.\u201d\n\nBiden continued: \u201cIt\u2019s just simply improper, because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you\u2019re doing is for them.\u201d", "description": "\u201cJoe Biden\u2019s campaign lacks grassroots enthusiasm.
