(That multiple is a key method of measuring the value of a stock relative to earnings.)\n\nBut, in the reality that perhaps matters most to markets, we were in the midst of an earnings recession that would soon come to an end.\n\nThe bull market had life and, three years later, it still does, he says.\n\nRead: How big will this year-end rally turn out to be?\n\nFor some context, Kramer used earnings data going back to 1988 and projections through to 2020, then overlaid that with a chart of the S&P for what he says is a self-explanatory reflection of where we stand.\n\nAnd, more importantly, where we\u2019re headed.\n\nKramer explained that the numbers show attractive equity valuations and, if corporate earnings continue to increase as expected, the market \u201chas a great distance to rise\u201d in the coming years.\n\nStocks are rising this morning, though not by \u201ca great distance\u201d yet.\n\nThe market\n\nFutures on the Dow YM00, +0.12%, S&P ES00, +0.22% and Nasdaq NQ00, +0.27% are all in the green ahead of the opening bell. The pound GBPUSD, +0.0540% is fairly volatile as investors wait for more Brexit updates after Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s deal vote was a non-starter on Saturday. Europe SXXP, +0.40% stocks are up.\n\nThe chart\n\nYes, it\u2019s a bit hairy out there.\n\nThis one is really stunning: A separate index that only focuses on uncertainty in global trade policy has surged to around 100 this year. From 1996 through 2018, its average level was about 2. \u201cI think political uncertainty is clearly far higher than it has been for a long time.\u201d pic.twitter.com/hgdAAT4Vvi \u2014 Steven Russolillo (@srussolillo) October 20, 2019\n\nThe buzz\n\nWe\u2019ve got a big week of earnings coming up, with bellwethers like Microsoft MSFT, -1.63%, Amazon AMZN, -1.68%, Procter & Gamble PG, +0.72% and Boeing BA, -6.79% among notables on the docket.\n\nVoters won\u2019t have to wait much longer to hear how Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren plans to pay for the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d future she envisions. The Massachusetts senator, who says she\u2019ll give the details of her plan soon, came under heavy fire from her opponents during last week\u2019s debate for refusing to say whether her plan would raise taxes on the middle class.\n\nThe strike at General Motors GM, -0.06% is spilling over into a second month, and the impact is intensifying across the Midwest in the U.S.he United Auto Workers union banged out a tentative labour deal with GM last week, but union leaders opted to continue picketing until workers approve the agreement.\n\nThe quote\n\n\u201cMarket stability should not be the subject of a tweet here or a tweet there. It requires consideration, thinking, quiet and measured and rational decisions.\u201d \u2014 Christine Lagarde, soon-to-be president of the European Central Bank, in an interview that aired on Sunday night on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d.\n\nThe economy\n\nNew and existing home sales figures for September are probably the economic highlight of the week, but we won\u2019t get a look at those until Thursday and Tuesday, respectively. There\u2019s nothing of note on the docket today. University of Michigan rounds out the week on Friday morning with the consumer sentiment index.\n\nRead: Latest data does nothing for investors \u2018animal spirits\u2019\n\nThe tweet\n\nHillary & her gang of rich, powerful elite are going after me to send a msg to YOU: \u201cShut up, toe the line, or be destroyed.\u201d But we, the people, will NOT be silenced.
