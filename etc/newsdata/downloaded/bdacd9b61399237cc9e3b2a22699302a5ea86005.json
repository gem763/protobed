The strategy has drawn comparisons to president Donald Trump, who has made similar unsubstantiated claims about minority communities in the US.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Allowing party-affiliated observers to film the voting process is the only way to prevent election theft,\u201d the prime minister said on Sunday.\n\nMr Netanyahu is facing a battle for political survival as he attempts to win a fifth term in the September 17 election, the second national vote to be held this year after April\u2019s vote proved inconclusive. His Likud party claimed the last election had been \u201cstolen\u201d by voter fraud.\n\nThe election camera bill has been widely criticised both for its questionable legality and for what many describe as an attempt to intimidate Arab voters.\n\nAyman Odeh, head of the Arab Joint List party, said on Twitter that Mr Netanyahu\u2019s focus on the issue of voter fraud was aimed at \u201ctriggering a panic vote\u201d by his supporters on the right and \u201csuppressing the Arab vote\u201d.\n\nHe added that Mr Netanyahu is \u201cpreparing the ground for the day he declares, \u2018Arabs have stolen the elections\u2019, and contests the results if he loses.\u201d\n\nYair Lapid, co-leader of the centrist Blue and White Party, which is running neck-and-neck with Likud in polls, alluded to the impact the deployment of cameras might have on Arab voter turnout, describing the bill as \u201cracist\u201d in comments on Twitter.\n\nArabs make up 21 per cent of Israel\u2019s population and generally vote not for Likud but for their own Arab parties or centrist or left-wing Jewish parties.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He denies any wrongdoing.\n\n\u2014 With agencies", "description": "Israel\u2019s cabinet has approved a controversial bill to allow cameras at polling stations during national elections, a move critics have suggested is aimed at lowering Arab turnout.", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/29/01/netanyahu-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
