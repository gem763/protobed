It demonstrated exactly why bad teams stay bad\n\nThe Jets\u2019 treatment of Kelechi Osemele was as shameful as it is was predictable, its cruelty matched only by its stupidity.\n\nTo recap: Osemele, an All-Pro guard who was acquired by the Jets as a free agent last offseason, sustained a torn labrum earlier in the season. Osemele wanted surgery on the injury, which would have likely kept him out for much if not all of the 2019 season. The Jets denied the request. They asked Osemele to take painkilling injections and carry on playing. Osemele decided to have the surgery anyway, without the blessing (but with the knowledge, an important distinction) of the Jets, after he received a third opinion. ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported on Saturday that Osemele\u2019s surgery was successful, but that the damage to his shoulder \u201cwas more extensive than anticipated.\u201d Rather than place Osemele on injured reserve, a designation that frees up a roster spot for the team but means the player is still paid, the Jets released Osemele, voiding his contract. The 30-year-old was due to make $9.1m this year.\n\nChicago Bears are a masterclass in how to waste a great defense Read more\n\nHis agents told Schefter that Osemele and the NFL Players\u2019 Association will take legal action against the Jets\u2019 team doctors for violations of state medical board regulations. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d Osemele told the New York Daily News last week. \u201cTake Vicodin? Where\u2019s the line? How much should a player play through pain? What is the limit? Is there a limit? Toradol every day? Does my health matter?\u201d\n\nOsemele expressed the apprehension many players have when it comes to the independence of team doctors. Are they thinking about the health and safety of the player long-term? Or is the goal to get the player back on the field for the next snap and the one after that and the one after that, long-term issues be damned?\n\nThat\u2019s one of the central tensions at the heart of a locker-room: how much does this team really care about me? And when a team is bad, everything is amplified. And the Jets are really bad.\n\nThis, right here, is why bad teams stay bad. It\u2019s not just the Jets. For example, an ongoing squabble between Cordy Glenn and the Bengals over how the team dealt with a head injury resulted in the left tackle receiving a one-game suspension. Every team has had its share of iffy medical situations, where a player\u2019s health hasn\u2019t seemed like the first and only priority. Only the Jets could look malicious and inept.\n\nCentral to this story is Jets head coach Adam Gase. Gase made the mother of all power plays last offseason when, kicked out of the head coach\u2019s office in Miami, he arrived in New York and demanded absolute power. The Jets, stunningly, sided with a coach whose top credential remains access to Peyton Manning\u2019s phone number.\n\nGase is the caricature of a football coach. Words like \u201ctoughness\u201d and \u201ctogetherness\u201d and \u201cleadership\u201d tumble from his mouth because he knows that\u2019s what is expected. But he delivers it with all the sincerity of a hard-up used car salesman. Gase is a man steeped in football-ology, a philosophy that sees players less as individuals and more as pawns of the oh-so-wise coach. Get out of the way, stay quiet, do what I say, and we will be successful.\n\nThere\u2019s an issue, though. Gase is a loser. He has coached 56 games in his NFL career. His teams have been more likely to lose by double digits (25) than to win (24). He is the man who presided over a staff in Miami where one of its high-ranking employees \u2013 an offensive-line coach \u2013 felt comfortable snorting white substances at his desk before a team meeting.\n\nJets Videos (@snyjets) Adam Gase responds to a question about why he hasn't spoken to Kelechi Osemele in the past few weeks \u2013 \"He hasn't asked to speak to me\" pic.twitter.com/UI6MAfqos0\n\nGiven a chance to show leadership and accountability on the Osemele matter, Gase cowered. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him,\u201d Gase said. Shouldn\u2019t you see him, he was asked. \u201cHe\u2019s injured. I\u2019m trying to get ready for the next opponent.\u201d Osemele was released less than 24 hours later.\n\nKevin Durant's injury is proof: Athletes need their own doctors | Etan Thomas Read more\n\nGase\u2019s handling of the situation has been a disgrace. It\u2019s easy to ask for all the power in an organization when you want to run the draft. But the job is hard when it comes to negotiating issues with players or dealing with outside forces \u2013 agents, the media, doctors. In such disputes, there\u2019s no front-office bogeyman you can throw under the bus. You\u2019re the guy. The player, media and staff want answers.\n\nGase isn\u2019t just unqualified, he is delusional. It has cost the Jets in the short-term \u2013 they are 1-6 this season \u2013 and it will continue to do so into the future. \u201cIf I\u2019m still an agent,\u201d former NFL agent and current CBS Sports analyst Joel Corry wrote this week, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend signing with the Jets.\u201d Gase was supposed to exorcise some of the stench of a team that has one winning season in the last eight. From his introductory press conference, to the team\u2019s record, to his handling of players, he has only served to plunge them to fresh depths.\n\nThe Osemele situation will do lasting damage to the Jets\u2019 reputation around the league. Players will still sign there, of course: the Jets will never fail to hand out inflated contracts to has-beens, because that\u2019s the company motto. And there are only 32 teams and a finite number of jobs across the league. But if a player has a choice, the prospect of working with a team who have shown such callousness towards a respected veteran will leave them with only one option \u2013 anyone but the Jets.", "description": "The New York Jets released the veteran guard after he had surgery on a shoulder injury.
