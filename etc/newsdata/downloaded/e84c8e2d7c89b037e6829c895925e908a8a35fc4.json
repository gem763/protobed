(Evan Mitsui/CBC)\n\nDe Villa's report includes a range of recommendations to \"improve vaccine acceptance,\" including removing exemptions, improving digital immunization records and developing a vaccine injury compensation fund.\n\nThe case for vaccinations\n\n\"Vaccines work, full stop,\" said Board of Health chair Joe Cressy. \"There is an abundance of scientifically proven evidence demonstrating just that.\"\n\nMost medical experts consider vaccinations safe and effective at preventing the spread of many harmful illnesses.\n\n\"Vaccination is one of the world's greatest public-health achievements, along with sanitation, antibiotics and clean drinking water,\" according to Health Canada.\n\nCressy pointed to recent measles outbreaks in Canada, the United States and Europe as proof that vaccine hesitancy has potentially dangerous outcomes.\n\nHe said the plan will help Toronto prevent similar outbreaks, rather than reacting to them after they occur.\n\n\"People have the fundamental right to believe what they want, but they do not have the right to endanger others,\" Cressy added.\n\n'I'm not prepared to wait for an outbreak,' said Joe Cressy, chair of Toronto's board of health. (Martin Trainor/CBC)\n\nLast year, 1.72 per cent of Toronto students did not receive mumps and rubella vaccines due to philosophical and religious exemptions, up from 0.8 per cent in 2007.\n\nWhile answering questions from board members, de Villa acknowledged that serious reactions can occur after vaccines are administered, though those instances are rare.\n\n\"That doesn't take away from the fact that [vaccines] are one of the most significant life-saving interventions that has occurred in medical history,\" she said.\n\nWhile the recommendations were unanimously approved Monday, the provincial government previously indicated that it has no plans to update provincial regulations.\n\nUnder the Immunization of School Pupils Act, children are required to have proof of immunization for certain diseases to attend school in Ontario, unless there is a \"valid medical exemption or affidavit of conscience or religious belief,\" said health ministry spokesperson Travis Kann.", "description": "Tensions flared at city hall on Monday as a large group of anti-vaccination parents protested against the city\u2019s decision to adopt a new vaccination strategy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5294312.1569264979!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/anti-vaccination-parent.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
