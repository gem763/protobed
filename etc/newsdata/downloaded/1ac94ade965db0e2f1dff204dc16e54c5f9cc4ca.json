He lost his first six decisions before being moved to the bullpen June 5.\n\n\u201cHe went through phases when he wasn\u2019t very good,\u201d Royals manager Ned Yost. \u201cWe put him in the \u2018pen and gave him another opportunity as a starter. He has stepped up and taken advantage of the opportunity.\u201d\n\nWhit Merrifield and Ryan O\u2019Hearn each had two hits and an RBI for the Royals, who have won five of six.\n\nDozier hit his 25th homer, a solo shot off Miami reliever Jeff Brigham in the eighth.\n\n\u201cI was trying to attack the first pitch, he throws hard,\u201d Dozier said. \u201cWe were trying to get as many runs as we can but it was our pitching staff that kept us in the game.\u201d\n\nKevin McCarthy pitched a perfect seventh before Scott Barlow allowed a pinch-hit, two-out single by Curtis Granderson and a double by Jon Berti in the eighth. Barlow retired Isan Diaz on a deep fly to center for the third out.\n\nIan Kennedy earned his 27th save.\n\nThe Marlins were shut out for the 21st time this season.\n\n\u201cWe just couldn\u2019t get anything going all night,\u201d Miami manager Don Mattingly said.\n\nO\u2019Hearn\u2019s double off Miami starter Pablo Lopez in the seventh gave the Royals a 2-0 advantage.\n\nPablo Lopez (5-8) had his longest outing since returning from the injured list Aug. 26. The right-hander, who missed two months because of a shoulder strain, lasted 6 1/3 innings, allowed two runs, eight hits and struck out four.\n\n\u201cA step forward,\u201d Pablo Lopez said. \u201cA great defense behind me gave me the confidence to keep pounding the strike zone. I want to finish the season healthy, that\u2019s my number one priority.\u201d\n\nThe Royals took a 1-0 lead on a run-scoring single by Merrifield in the third. Merrifield drove in Meibrys Viloria, who had singled and advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Jorge Lopez.\n\nBryan Holaday attempted to tie it in the fifth, running from first on Pablo Lopez\u2019s opposite field double to left center. Merrifield\u2019s relay throw from centerfielder Brett Phillips caught Holaday at the plate.\n\nMERRIFIELD IN THE RIGHT PLACE:\n\nAlthough Phillips overthrew shortstop Adalberto Mondesi, the first cutoff target on Lopez\u2019s double, Merrifield was perfectly situated to catch the relay and throw home to get Holaday, the Marlins catcher, for the final out of the inning.\n\n\u201cJust standard spring training 101,\u201d Merrifield said. \u201cBrett made a good throw, a little high, but we had two guys there. Luckily they had a catcher running and we were able to get him out. For us to keep it a 1-0, it was a big point in the game.\u201d\n\nODD PAIRING BETWEEN NAMESAKES:\n\nFriday\u2019s matchup between the Lopezes was only the second time in major league history that featured two starting pitchers with a Lopez surname, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The other game also featured Jorge Lopez, who faced Reynaldo Lopez, of the Chicago White Sox, April 16.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM:\n\nRoyals: RHP Jesse Hahn (elbow sprain) will have rest days between outings after a scoreless inning in his season debut against Detroit on Thursday. \u201cWe want to make sure that in this rehab process that we\u2019re doing it right and we\u2019re protecting him,\u201d manager Ned Yost said.\n\nMarlins: RHP Jordan Yamamoto (forearm strain) threw a bullpen session before Friday\u2019s game. Yamamoto was placed on the 10-day injured list Aug. 28.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nRoyals: LHP Danny Duffy (5-6, 4.89) will start the middle game of the series Saturday.\n\nMarlins: LHP Caleb Smith (8-9, 4.30) will make his first career start against the Royals. Smith has lost four of his last five starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jorge Lopez did a two-month stint in the bullpen, and now the right-hander is performing like the pitcher who earned a spot in the starting rotation at the beginning of the season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/royals_marlins_baseball_75818_c0-157-3763-2351_s1770x1032.jpg?7a0daaed2877e0af2d55f71c0c20777ed7db759b", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
