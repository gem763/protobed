These are also the places that have grown the fastest over the past 25 years .\n\nAll of this has put the suburbs at the center of the nation\u2019s political map in 2020. It is also scrambling old patterns. Mrs. Clinton did better than Barack Obama in Texas, Georgia and Arizona, states that have fast-growing suburbs thick with educated voters. In Michigan last year, two Democrats, Haley Stevens and Elissa Slotkin, won suburban districts that Republicans had dominated.\n\n\u201cIt was a remarkable change,\u201d said Amy Walter, national editor of The Cook Political Report. \u201cYou saw this happen almost across the board from Orange County to Houston, Atlanta, Seattle all in the same year. Suddenly there was no regional difference. It was the nationalization of suburbia.\u201d\n\nA Realignment Around Education\n\nWhen Mr. Levitt moved to East Grand Rapids in 1994, it was almost entirely white, and conservative in a Christian Reformed kind of way \u2014 the church of the Dutch immigrants who settled here.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mow your lawn on Sundays, that kind of stuff,\u201d Mr. Levitt said.\n\nMr. Levitt, who is from Chicago, remembers being surprised to discover that even many city workers voted Republican. In 1996, Bob Dole got 57 percent of the presidential vote in East Grand Rapids, far more than the 41 percent he received in the rest of the country.\n\nBut that was not unusual. East Grand Rapids was an educated place, and educated Americans tended to be Republicans.", "description": "The political dividing line in America used to be between Democratic cities and Republican suburbs.
