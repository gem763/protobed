The simulator put a stand-alone weapon in the recruits\u2019 hand that interacted with a large-screen video scenario. One scenario had a man rush by the recruit, failing to heed the recruit\u2019s order to stop. Following immediately, another man rushed out of the door with a handgun raised in the air. He stopped and said the first man had just robbed his store.\n\nAfterward, the sergeant asked me why I didn\u2019t fire at the two men and I replied that the first man posed no threat as he rushed by, and the second man posed no threat as he had his gun pointed up in the air.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the sergeant said. \u201cThat sweet, elderly woman before you \u201csmoked\u201d \u2019em both.\u201d\n\nFATS training is useful, then and now, as it helps to prepare the officer for scenarios he or she may encounter on the street when a split-second decision may mean life or death for them and others.\n\nMaking split-second decisions on the street just got somewhat harder for police officers in California with the passing of AB 392, which California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law on Aug. 19.\n\nThe measure would prohibit officers from using deadly force unless it is \u201cnecessary\u201d to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to officers or bystanders. The previous standard allowed officers to use deadly force if they had \u201creasonable\u201d fear they or others are in imminent danger. Police critics believe that the previous standard made it highly unlikely that officers who use deadly force could be charged with murder and unlikely that juries would convict them.\n\nAccording to the governor\u2019s office, the bill enacts one of the strongest use-of-force laws in the country.\n\n\u201cAB 392 modernizes standards for use of deadly force by officers. Specifically, this bill updates the existing deadly force to provide that deadly force may only be used when necessary. AB 392 also requires officers to use other techniques to address threats instead of using deadly force when safe to do so, encouraging law enforcement to train on and use de-escalation techniques like verbal persuasion and other crisis intervention methods.\n\n\u201cThe provisions in AB 392 will be reflected in both law enforcement agency policy and officer training statewide and will further ensure that all officers in California are trained to a higher legal standard.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU of Southern California weighed in, stating that police officers should avoid using deadly force whenever possible. \u201cBut, right now, officers can legally use deadly force and kill someone even when they have other alternatives. AB 392: The California Act to Save Lives, introduced this year by Assembly member Shirley Weber (D-San Diego), will make clear that police officers should only use deadly force when necessary.\u201d\n\nThe police unions and organizations didn\u2019t oppose the bill, as concessions were made, leading some police critics to call the revised bill \u201cwatered down.\u201d Still, many rank-and-file officers are concerned. They are concerned that the bill will cause some officers to hesitate and that hesitation will cost them their life and the lives of others.\n\nMany police officers across the nation are concerned about a slippery slope leading to more aggressive anti-cop bills that will \u201chandcuff\u201d police, especially during a time of more and more people resisting arrest and assaulting police officers in what some have called a \u201cWar on Cops.\u201d Officers are also concerned about progressive district attorneys who are more likely to prosecute police officers.\n\nSpeaking before the Grand Lodge Fraternal Order of Police\u2019s 64th National Biennial Conference on Aug. 12, Attorney General William Barr noted that from 2014 through 2017, there was a 20 percent increase in assaults against police. He also spoke of the emergence in some large cities of district attorneys who see themselves as social justice reformers and undercut the police and go easy on criminals.\n\nIn addition to the social-activist district attorneys, two Democratic presidential candidates, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, showed their bias by tweeting on the fifth anniversary of the police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, that Michael Brown was \u201cmurdered\u201d by the police, despite the overwhelming evidence that the officer was legally justified in the shooting death.\n\nI would have liked to see the supporters of AB 392 step up to the FATS simulator. I\u2019ll bet that the bad guys in the video scenario will smoke \u2018em all.\n\n\u2022 Paul Davis covers crime, espionage and terrorism.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
