Mr Sanderson died, and Mrs Sanderson was flown by rescue helicopter (pictured) to Cairns Hospital\n\nThroughout the day, Ms Liebelt and her husband had been chatting to the couple about their trip as they waited for their turn on the different ziplines.\n\n'We aren't sure how long they'd been away, but they had flown up to Brisbane because their son had got into the army academy, so they'd gone to see him,' she said.\n\n'The husband who passed had wanted to go ziplining in the Daintree - it was on his bucket list... they thought while they were up in Brisbane they'd fly up and do it.'\n\nMr Sanderson is believed to have died on impact, while Mrs Sanderson, who was airlifted to Cairns Hospital with suspected spine injuries, is now in a stable condition.\n\nA statement released by the family remembers Mr Sanderson as a 'husband, father and great friend', whose death is a 'tragic loss'.\n\n'His wife Shannon is currently in hospital recovering after also sustaining injuries in the accident,' the statement read.\n\n'We would like to thank the Queensland Police, Queensland Paramedics and the tremendous staff at the Cairns Hospital for their support.\n\n'We remember Dean as a loving husband, father, son, brother and friend to all.'\n\nMs Liebelt said the rainforest the couple fell through is incredibly dense, and it is hard to know where the couple would have landed.\n\n'You can't see anything down there, we don't know what they would have hit on the way down - apparently there's a waterfall there,' she said.\n\n'He would have broken her fall - he was the first one on the line, and he would have weighed more.'\n\nThe couple, from Adelaide, had been in Brisbane to see their son after he was accepted into the army academy\n\nA witness said there was a moment of complete silence before Mrs Sanderson's scream filled the rainforest (scene pictured)\n\nAfter the fall, Ms Liebelt said another zipliner, who worked as a paramedic, asked to be helped down so he could assist, but she was unable to move from her tower as there was no longer a cable.\n\n'We were on the tower for maybe an hour or more - the two staff members who were up with us had to make a rope pulley system to help us get down.'\n\nTuesday was not the Sanderson's first experience ziplining. The couple had previously travelled to Bali and flown through the trees there.\n\nAs they put their safety equipment on in Queensland, Ms Liebelt said they had remarked how safe it all seemed in comparison.\n\n'They said the harnesses over here felt very safe, 'Oh look at the safety here, not like what we had in Bali',' she explained.\n\nMs Liebelt said the horrific scene had left a scar on her mind, and she and her husband would be seeking counselling when they returned home to Hervey Bay.\n\n'We haven't had an ounce of sleep,' she said.\n\n'Every time we shut our eyes it's there.'\n\nFar North Police Inspector Rhys Newton said it was a 'tragedy'.\n\nA statement from the family said Mr Sanderson will be remembered as 'a loving husband, father, son, brother and friend to all'\n\nThroughout the day, Ms Liebelt and her husband had been chatting to the couple about their trip as they waited for their turn on the different ziplines (pictured)\n\n'This is a tragic incident and one that, once we know the full circumstances, we hope we can help to ensure never happens again,' he said.\n\n'We are providing support to the family and other witnesses involved.'\n\nWorkplace Health and Safety officers are continuing to investigate alongside police, who will prepare a report for the coroner.\n\nDetectives will prepare a report for the coroner.\n\nPhoebe Kitto, a director of Jungle Surfing, told The Advertiser the company will be cooperating with workplace health and safety officers throughout the investigation.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted Jungle Surfing for comment.", "description": "Father-of-three Dean Sanderson was ticking off a bucket list item when his ziplining adventure through the Daintree went horribly wrong, with a snapped cable sending him to his death.", "authors": ["Hannah Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/05/20068448-0-image-a-9_1571805255438.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
