He could have been dead.\n\nThe man from North Carolina in the US had been sentenced to death in 1976 in connection with the murder of a petrol station owner during a robbery.\n\nWhat saved him from the gallows was that the law making the death penalty mandatory for certain crimes in that state was declared unconstitutional a year after his conviction, so his sentence was commuted to life in prison.\n\nThrough the decades, Finch maintained his innocence, doing his damnedest to prove he was nowhere near the scene of the crime.\n\nA ray of light began to glimmer in 2002, when Duke Law School activist academics and students who were taking on the causes of possibly wrongfully convicted individuals took an interest in his case.\n\nBut it was to take many years \u2013 17, to be precise \u2013 from that moment to vindication.\n\nIn the end, the Duke team was able to convince the courts that everything \u2013 from Finch\u2019s arrest and the police line-up to the sham investigation and the trial \u2013 had been designed to secure a conviction at all costs.\n\nA massive miscarriage of justice had occurred.\n\nA three-judge panel in the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that Finch had proven his \u201cactual innocence\u201d and set him free.\n\nThe wheelchair-bound 81-year-old said he was \u201cconfused\u201d about his surroundings and his feelings as he was pushed out of the prison gates.\n\nJames E Coleman Jr, the co-director of the Wrongful Convictions Clinic at Duke Law School, paid tribute to Finch, saying: \u201cRay went in a young man and he was coming out physically bent in a wheelchair, but his spirit and his dignity were never broken.\u201d\n\nFinch was one of the lucky ones. He was the 166th American to have been exonerated since 1976.\n\nHad it not been for the hard work of activists, all 166 would have been killed or would have died in prison for crimes they knew nothing about.\n\nOthers have gone to the gallows only to later be found innocent.\n\nAs the US\u2019s Death Penalty Information Centre points out, \u201ccourts do not generally entertain claims of innocence when the defendant is dead. Defence attorneys move on to other cases where clients\u2019 lives can still be saved.\u201d\n\nThat is the price paid for this punishment, which, according to the centre, is \u201csubject to arbitrariness, bias and human fallibility\u201d.\n\nThe US, which prides itself as an enlightened \u201cleader of the free world\u201d, is one of about 50 countries that still retains capital punishment, though fewer than 20 of these countries actively execute people.\n\nThe US is in the fine company of marvellous democracies such as China, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.\n\nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has noted that the number of countries retaining the \u201cbarbaric practice\u201d that \u201chas no place in the 21st century\u201d is declining.\n\nHow ironic that, in South Africa \u2013 a country that was ruled by a regime that took great pleasure in executing black people and used the death penalty as one of the tools to subjugate the majority \u2013 there is a renewed appetite for capital punishment.\n\nLast week, amid the national outrage over femicide, there were loud calls for the return of the death penalty.\n\nPolitical parties, pressure groups, the Twitter mob and callers to radio stations demanded that the Constitution be amended to allow the state to carry out revenge killings.\n\nToday, we forget how poor black people were sentenced and put to death due to the fact that they could not afford proper legal representation.\n\nThat black majority is still poor.\n\nThis populist frenzy happens every time there is a horrific crime committed in the country.\n\nThe difference this time is that Justice Minister Ronald Lamola \u2013 who is a sensible guy save for the fact that he supports Kaizer Chiefs \u2013 briefly gave hope to the mob when he said Cabinet would discuss the matter.\n\nHe quickly retracted this, and his department stated that the death penalty had never been a deterrent in any society and had been rejected by the wise authors of the Constitution.\n\nThis is a really tired debate. It was killed by the 1996 Constitutional Court judgment that deemed capital punishment inconsistent with the Bill of Rights in our republic\u2019s founding document.\n\nIn that landmark unanimous judgment, penned by the late Justice Arthur Chaskalson, the court said that \u201cthe death sentence destroys life, which is protected without reservation under section 9 of our Constitution ... and annihilates human dignity, which is protected under section 10\u201d.\n\nOn behalf of his fellow justices, Chaskalson went on to say the \u201celements of arbitrariness are present in its enforcement and it is irremediable ... I am satisfied that, in the context of our Constitution, the death penalty is indeed a cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment\u201d.\n\nThat was the final word on the matter. Any other noise to the contrary is just that \u2013 noise.\n\nSo, to the death penalty lobby, let\u2019s kill this debate because it is not even a debate.\n\nAs South Africans, we should be discussing strong, feasible strategies to deal with the demons that plague our land and produce the kind of monstrous behaviour we see in our fellow citizens.\n\nPS, this lowly newspaperman wonders how many of those who want the death penalty back would be prepared to carry out these cold-blooded executions themselves.\n\nWould Jimmy Manyi (or whatever he calls himself these days) apply for the job of executioner?", "description": "In May, Charles Ray Finch became a free man after spending 43 years in prison for a crime he did not commit.", "authors": ["Mondli Makhanya"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8058/e12e6003ffaa4af8a341c58771b942f2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
