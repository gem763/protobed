Bercow strongly protested the suspension at the time, deeming it \u201can act of executive fiat.\u201d\n\nThen, on September 24 the British supreme court ruled the suspension of Parliament illegal.\n\nBercow has promised to resign by October 31. While Johnson and other ministers have framed Parliament as frustrating the will of the people when dealing with Brexit, Bercow declared himself unmoved, telling CNN the attacks on Parliament are \u201cunworthy. They don\u2019t amount to a row of beans, and I\u2019m not at all intimidated by them.\u201d", "description": "British Parliament Speaker John Bercow met with European Union President David Sassoli to discuss how best to prevent Britain from making a clean break with the E.U., Sassoli revealed on the floor of the European parliament on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Rich Lowry", "Kevin D.
