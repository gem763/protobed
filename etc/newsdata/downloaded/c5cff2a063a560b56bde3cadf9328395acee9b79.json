Flu often brings on a fever, which raises the risks that her baby will have spinal and neurological defects.\n\nBut women who get the shot are at a 40 percent lower risk of being hospitalized for the virus.\n\nA mother's vaccination during pregnancy protects her baby for the first several months of her or his life, lowering the infant's risk of hospitalization for flu by 72 percent, according to the CDC's latest report.\n\nFlu causes more severe illness in pregnant women and the youngest infants, meaning the majority that wind up hospitalized are under five months old, a CDC graph shows\n\nThe vast majority of infants hospitalized with whooping cough catch it before they are two months old, meaning it's too soon for them to be vaccinated\n\nAlthough whooping cough is less common than the flu, it still poses a risk to pregnant women and a potentially lethal one to babies.\n\nAbout 20 babies have died of whooping cough each year in the US since 2010.\n\nAnd 68 percent of those fatalities are in babies younger than two months old, at which time they would have received their first dose of the Tdap vaccine, which protects against whooping cough.\n\nThe CDC recommends that expecting mothers get the Tdap vaccine between 27 and 36 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIf they do, their babies are 78% less likely to catch whooping cough in the first two months of life, and 91 percent less likely to be hospitalized for the infection.\n\nDespite all of these advantages, only about one in three women get both the flu shot and Tdap shot while they're pregnant, leaving their infants unnecessarily vulnerable to two diseases that could kill them.\n\nThe CDC urges pregnant women to get vaccinated and for doctors to start talking with their pregnant patients about shots early on to be sure their every concern is addressed, and increase the likelihood they will protect themselves and their babies.", "description": "Only one-third of pregnant women get flu and Tdap shots, despite the fact they vaccines lower the risks that they and their babies will be hospitalized for the infections, worrying CDC data revel.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/20/19451106-0-image-a-24_1570562433464.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
