Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar.", "description": "\u201cIf they are doing this to an elected official, I can only imagine what\u00a0they are doing to the average Muslim American or Hispanic American.\u201d", "authors": ["Dean Obeidallah"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_2998,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568958531/190920-deano-muslim-mayor-detained-hero_vagsny", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
