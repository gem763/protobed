Tonight we hope to hear moderators ask, and candidates answer, how exactly they will be the Gun Safety President our country deserves.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Giffords Courage launched its \u201cGun Safety President\u201d campaign with a video of several Democratic candidates stressing the importance of keeping children and schools safe from gun violence. The now-viral video features Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former Vice President Joe Biden and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (Texas).\n\nAll of those candidates will be on the debate stage Thursday, and will have been informed of the shooting survivors joining Giffords in the audience.\n\n\u201cThe American people overwhelmingly support action and leadership on gun violence prevention legislation,\u201d Escobar said in a statement. \u201cWhile we know that the Democratic presidential candidates stand with the majority of the American people, as does our House majority, we must persist until those standing in the way of safe communities relent or get replaced.\u201d\n\nGiffords Courage\u2019s executive director, Peter Ambler, who is an El Paso native, told HuffPost that, although Democratic presidential candidates have agreed on a lot of aspects of gun safety, there is room for candidates to dish out the details of their plan and how exactly their proposals will reduce gun violence.\n\n\u201cWe expect it to be front and center in terms of issues that are discussed and debated,\u201d Ambler said. \u201cIf our candidates are not talking about it, if they\u2019re not bringing it up \u2026 then they\u2019re not going to ultimately have the mandate that they need when they actually get to the White House to act on this issue.\u201d\n\nThe issue of gun control is expected to come up during the debate, with the event being held in a state that\u2019s dealt with two mass shootings since the beginning of August, in El Paso and an Aug. 31 rampage in the Odessa area. A new HuffPost/YouGov poll also shows that most Democrats support more aggressive positions on gun control.\n\nOne candidate who is expected to speak forcefully on gun violence is O\u2019Rourke, who used to represent his hometown of El Paso as a congressman and took time off the campaign trail to help heal the community after the mass shooting. His gun safety plan is also one of the more aggressive proposals, with a mandatory buyback program for assault rifles and a voluntary buyback for handguns.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see two core contrasts on stage. One is there\u2019s going to be a contrast with the current president. And the other is going to be a contrast with the politics of the past,\u201d Ambler said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, this [gun safety] was considered a third rail of our politics, and even Democrats ran away from it rather than toward it,\u201d he added. \u201c Today, gun violence is a kitchen table issue in this country on the same level as \u2026 issues that get a lot of attention during campaigns.\u201d", "description": "Former Rep.
