On Tuesday night, it downgraded that forecast to 1.7 per cent. By comparison, it is expecting the Greek economy to grow this year by two per cent (pictured is the view from the Acropolis in Athens)\n\nIt hinted the trade war between the United States and China, Australia's biggest trading partner, would drag down global economic activity.\n\n'This subdued growth is a consequence of rising trade barriers; elevated uncertainty surrounding trade and geopolitics,' the IMF said.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia this month cut interest rates for the third time in four months, taking the cash rate to a new record low of 0.75 per cent.\n\nThe IMF expected the Australian economy to grow by 2.3 per cent in 2020 compared with 2.2 per cent for Greece.\n\nAfter the GFC, Greek debt became so bad it needed the IMF to bail it out twice , in 2010 and 2012. The European Union financed a third bailout in 2015, after previously co-funding bailout packages with the IMF.\n\nThe Greek government's debt was so high it was unable to borrow on the bond market to finance its welfare programs.\n\nIn 2013, Greece's unemployment rate surged to 27.5 per cent - a level more than five times Australia's current jobless level of 5.3 per cent.\n\nThere were also fears the 19 nations in the Eurozone would collapse.\n\nEconomic woes in Greece also led to the hard-left Syriza coalition of Marxist parties coming to power in 2015, as voters and protesters railed against IMF austerity measures.", "description": "The International Monetary Fund is so downbeat about Australia it has downgraded its growth forecasts for 2019 - expecting it to do even worse than Greece which has debt problems.", "authors": ["Stephen Johnson For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/00/19763794-0-image-a-2_1571180775199.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
