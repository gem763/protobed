It just shows you the agency of images to destabilise our perceptions.\u201d\n\nPhotography was banned by the Taliban but a handful of photo studios were allowed to remain open, not least because passport photographs were still needed.\n\nDworzak was in Kandahar for the New Yorker a few weeks after remaining Taliban fighters had been chased away. He came across the photographs in the backroom of a studio and offered to buy them.\n\n\u201cThey were more than happy. They said \u2018look they\u2019re not going to come back to pick them up.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe said the photographs could be seen as an extreme form of hypocrisy. But he also found them \u201cincredibly touching\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m almost envious of the photographer that they could take these portraits of these guys \u2026 the Taliban then were the absolute personification of evil and you have them holding hands with plastic flowers. It is very confusing but I like that.\u201d\n\nDworzak published a book of the pictures and was criticised by some for making fun of the men; by others of showing them in too positive a light.\n\n\u201cI never expected that reaction. A lot of people also thought I took the pictures.\n\n\u201cWhat is important I think is that this is not a Taliban-specific aesthetic. It is something you can find in the sub-continent, in India and Pakistan. The extra twist is the Taliban banned photography.\u201d\n\nThe photographs will be included in a major group show titled Masculinities: Liberation Through Photography featuring work by 50 artists including Annette Messager, Richard Avedon, Isaac Julien and Catherine Opie.\n\nIt is part of a wider year-long season at the Barbican called Inside Out, exploring the relationship between people\u2019s inner lives and creativity.\n\nTheatrical highlights will include two shows directed by Ivo van Hove \u2013 an adaptation of Thomas Mann\u2019s Death in Venice and Tennessee Williams\u2019 The Glass Menagerie starring Isabelle Huppert as Amanda; and a new production from Belarus Free Theatre which is being staged 10 years since it was put in political exile.\n\n\u2022 Masculinities: Liberation through Photography is at the Barbican art gallery 20 February-17 May.", "description": "Photographs, found in Kandahar, Afghanistan, taken despite ban on photography", "authors": ["Mark Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cad0f8b2d0c0da822e1357be8288a35256bcfc1/0_157_4600_2761/master/4600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe0c50af8640d7bd4af9a7837295b1e4", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
