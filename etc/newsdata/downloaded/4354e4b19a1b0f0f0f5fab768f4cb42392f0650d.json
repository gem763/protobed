In this edition of Reporter we look at the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nFire has already blackened the regional government building in Tuzla. Now, the empty windows look down on yet another protest march \u2013 one of many in Bosnia-Herzegovina nowadays.\n\nIs it a \u2018political spring\u2019? This is where it all started when middle-class families march alongside students and the unemployed. The protests against unemployment, corruption and political inertia have already toppled four out of 10 regional governments.\n\nProtest leader Damir Arsenijevic explained the problems to euronews: \u201cCorrupt privatisation. Political parties controlling the judiciary, controlling the police, promoting terror in everyday life and that\u2019s the worst thing: that they have actually stolen the money from the people and they have got richer.\u201d\n\nEmin Eminagic, an activist in Tuzla complained: \u201cWe have been lied to for 20 years. We have been oppressed for 20 years, people are hungry, people are starving. We do not have job prospects here, we will not have a future here unless we change something.\u201d\n\nIn early February, government buildings were set alight in Sarajevo, Zenica and Tuzla. It was the worst violence since the end of the war in 1995. But even after the violence, all over the country the protests continue \u2013 peacefully this time.\n\nTuzla is the regional capital. In the job centre they tell us that this region has 100,000 unemployed people and only 80,000 people in work. Less than four million people live in Bosnia. Depending on which statistics you use, 25-45 percent of them are without an official work contract. The \u201cgrey economy\u201d governs all social and political relations in the country.\n\nAldin Siranovic is one of those who triggered the protests. In the resulting turmoil, dozens of ministers lost their jobs. He received threats but said he does not regret exposing the corruption experienced by he and his wife: \u201cThe Social Services Minister in the government told her: \u2018If you want to work in healthcare, you need to pay 25,000 Bosnian marks [approximately 13,000 euros] to the director of that institution\u2019. I got a job at Telecom Bosnia, in the normal way. I was working over there for three months, after three months my supervisor said: \u2018Hey, you didn\u2019t pay 25,000 marks to get employed here, so if you do not pay, you will get fired and my cousin will come to work here\u2019.\u201d\n\nBosnia looses an estimated 800 million euros a year due to manipulated public tenders. State budgets are low while public expenditure and debt are climbing ever higher.\n\nEmir Dikic chairs the board of the Bosnian branch of the anti-corruption NGO \u201cTransparency International\u201d. He told euronews: \u201cThe reform of the judiciary has failed. Basically, the judiciary is still under high political pressure and we have a country that is corrupted by the six or seven most powerful persons in the country: those guys are the presidents of the leading political parties.\u201d\n\nThere used to be several factories in Tuzla, employing around 3,000 people, including Sakib Kopic, who worked in the chemical plant for 33 years. Now he is one of the protesters and says people want to be governed by experts. Laid-off workers use the expression \u201cmafia privatisation\u201d. Why?\n\nSakib Kopic explained: \u201cSomeone comes to buy a company for almost nothing, they get one, two three bank loans, then they destroy the company, they close it down, and the privatisation-mafia put the money into their own pockets. The people who invented these privatisation schemes should be sent to prison where they should be made to crush stones with a rubber mallet.\u201d\n\nIn Zenica, the heartland of Bosnian steel production, the people have also toppled the regional government. All over Bosnia \u201ccitizens\u2019 assemblies\u201d are pushing for transparency on public spending and the abolition of privileges for politicians.\n\nPolitical Science student Aldin Alic and Mustafa Bisic, who is studying Economics, call themselves \u201cchange-makers\u201d launching flash-mobs against air-pollution and taking part in citizens\u2019 assemblies. Aldin Alic said: \u201cThe state structure is too complicated. In Bosnia-Herzegovina we have 13 regional governments, more than 130 ministries and ministers, and on the top of that we have five presidents. We have a whole bunch of leaders but they don\u2019t lead.\u201d\n\nWe move on to the capital, Sarajevo, where workers are repairing government buildings torched by protesters a few days ago.\n\nMany people point the finger at the \u201cDayton Agreement\u201d. The deal ended war, but by dividing power in order to stop fighting between Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks it created a dysfunctional system unable to steer Bosnia through economic transition.\n\nWe asked one EU diplomat for his opinion on how to move forward. Valentin Inzko, High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, said: \u201cI appeal to the governing decision-makers: do not be afraid of the population. Listen to the requests of the citizens. And I appeal to the public prosecutors too. Do not be afraid to do your jobs!\u201d\n\nWill the country join the EU one day? For the moment failure to reform the constitution has frozen Bosnia\u2019s bid for EU accession. Nevertheless, the European Union\u2019s Special Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Peter Sorensen, hasn\u2019t given up hope: \u201cWhat we can do and what we are doing is making sure that the offer of eventually membership is clear to everybody: The EU perspective is kept alive.\u201d\n\nBack in Tuzla, the Dita laundry powder factory is standing idle, having also been privatised. The workers, guarding the site, say the machines are still functional.\n\nFehim Avdihodzic, a Dita factory worker, said: \u201cThe factory has not worked for a year, but it could be restarted any time. We prevent the machines being removed: five shifts guard them at night, four shifts during the day.\u201d\n\nThe workers say the factory owner did not pay social security contributions, meaning that they are no longer fully eligible for healthcare, social security or pensions.\n\nAdnan Hamidovic is an MC & rapper who performs under the name of Frenkie. During the war, his family took refuge in Germany but today, Frenkie lives in Tuzla, and raps about the situation. He told euronews: \u201cPoliticians have been telling us the same lies over and over for the last 20 years. It\u2019s the tactics of nationalism. Politicians use it as a weapon, and that is the main root of our problems and conflicts, even today.\u201d\n\nIt is too early to call the protests a \u201cBosnian Spring\u201d. But without change, there will be one, and possibly a violent one. The message from the EU is clear: clean up corruption and keep ethnic questions out of it. Otherwise you\u2019re playing with fire. The Balkans are a powder keg and Bosnia is part of it.\n\nEuronews reporter Hans von der Brelie interviewed Valentin Inzko, EU High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
