Asking France again for asylum this week, he argued that \"protecting whistleblowers is not a hostile act.\"\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told CNews television Thursday that when Snowden first asked for French asylum in 2013, the French government \"considered it was not the time. I don't see what has changed.\"\n\nSnowden has also sought asylum in several other countries. His memoir was released in about 20 countries this week, including France.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
