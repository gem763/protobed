Portraying a new person is fun.\"\n\nIn the interview, Larry also shared that he doesn't hide anything from his daughter.\n\n\"[Dannielynn] knows just really that her mom was famous and she knows about [Anna's late son] Daniel,\" Larry revealed. \"I try to incorporate both of them because sometimes Daniel gets forgotten.\n\n\"We try to talk about him and I shared a birthday with him, so we always celebrated together,\" he added.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDaniel died in 2006 while visiting his mother in the hospital where Anna Nicole had given birth the week before, a Bahamas police official said at the time. He was 20. Five months later, Anna Nicole died of an accidental drug overdose at the age of 39.\n\n\"You know, I tell her stories about them and I try to not make it heavy because she's just now becoming a teenager and I think some of that stuff will come,\" Larry said, adding that he tries to keep any outside negativity about Anna Nicole away from Dannielynn.\n\n\"That's the thing, there's so many bad things that people say and rarely do you hear the good things she did for charities and different people,\" he explained. \"Those are the stories I like to tell, you know? Not the ones you see in the checkout stand.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Could\u00a0Dannielynn Birkhead one day follow in her late mom Anna Nicole Smith's\u00a0acting footsteps?", "authors": ["Mariah Haas"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/Dannilynn-GETTY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
