What I can\u2019t let happen I can\u2019t let this distract me in a way that takes me away from the issues that really are the reason why I\u2019m running.\u201d\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nBiden was commenting on the White House release of the non-verbatim transcript memo of a call that Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July.\n\nAccording to the transcript memo of the call, Trump asked Zelensky to start an investigation of Biden and his son, Hunter. Hunter Biden held a directorship of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, when his father was vice president. That raised ethical concerns at the time, but according to Politifact, there is no evidence that Biden talked to his son in a substantive way about the company or that his call to fire a Ukrainian prosecutor was an effort to end an investigation into Burisma.\n\nIn his interview, Biden pointed to other aspects of the phone call, including Trump\u2019s request that Zelensky speak to his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr about investigating the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThe idea that someone would call a head of a foreign state, ahead of time withhold significant military aid that\u2019s badly needed in order to prevent the Russian separatists who are in Ukraine, from taking over Ukraine, and then ask basically, \u2018Can you cooperate with Rudy Giuliani? He\u2019s coming over,'\u201d Biden told Kimmel. \u201cAnd the thing I learned, the thing we all learned recently, in that statement, that 2,000 word statement released, was talked about getting the Justice Department engaged in this. It\u2019s such a blatant abuse of power that I don\u2019t think it can stand.\u201d\n\nKimmel asked Biden, \u201cHow does this rank as far as on the outlandish scale for you the last 48 hours watching this transpire?\u201d\n\nBiden responded, \u201c18 out of 10. This is kind of bizarre and you know, it\u2019s Rudy Giuliani is a great character witness the president has.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like his body has been taken over by another being,\u201d Kimmel quipped.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the president could do that,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden also warned against reelecting Trump, telling Kimmel that \u201ceight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of this nation, in my view.\u201d\n\nWhen Kimmel noted that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said that he was \u201cvery good friends,\u201d then defended Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian leader, Biden made a sign of the cross.\n\nBiden has been on a fundraising swing through Los Angeles. Earlier on Wednesday, he attended an event in Manhattan Beach at the home of Sanjay Khurana, a surgeon, and his wife Mona, a software engineer. About 150 guests attended the fundraiser, with tickets starting at $250 per person. Those who write checks for the maximum of $2,800 per person got access to a photo with Biden.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Biden attended a fundraiser at the Bel-Air home of Sean Burton, the CEO of investment and development firm Cityview, and his wife Teresa. The co-chairs of the event included Joe Waz, senior strategic adviser to Comcast Corporation, and his wife, Cynthia Telles, founding director of the UCLA Hispanic Neuropsychiatric Center of Excellence.\n\nAmong those at the event were Alyssa Milano and Zach Braff.\n\nBiden told those at the event that there was no proof to Trump\u2019s allegations about he and his son.\n\n\u201cThis is not about me, and it really isn\u2019t, because not a single publication said anything he has ever said about me or my son is true,\u201d Biden said, according to a pool report. \u201cEveryone has gone and researched it and said it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nBiden then got a laugh when he suggested that Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate because \u201c70-something polls show that I\u2019ll kick his \u2026 toes.\u201d\n\nBiden relayed stories of how his grandchildren encouraged him to run. He said his youngest grandson showed him a picture of them together at his son Beau Biden\u2019s funeral. In the photo, Biden is shown holding his grandson\u2019s chin while standing in front of Beau\u2019s casket. But trolls on the internet had already labeled the photo as \u201cJoe Biden abusing a child.\u201d", "description": "Joe Biden, appearing on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday, said that \"it seems to me it's awful hard to avoid the conclusion\" that President Trump committed \"an impeachable offense and a violation of constitutional responsibility.\" \"I am confident in the ability of", "authors": ["Ted Johnson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GllR1ifS7K4ZRhQkrB_OKQ--~B/aD0xNjMyO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/deadline.com/17767d6bd80b0308bef5f742c731dcf1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
