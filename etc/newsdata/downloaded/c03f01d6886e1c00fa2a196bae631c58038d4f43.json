Now, according to Sony\u2019s announcement, it\u2019ll work with all devices running Android 5.0 or higher \u2014 meaning you can finally use that tantalizing Remote Play app on the Play Store. Given the Xperias have had Remote Play as a feature since 2014, it felt like a cruel joke for Sony to make them the only Android phones compatible with Remote Play, and that\u2019s finally been rectified.\n\nRemote Play comes a little late in the PS4\u2019s lifecycle for its millions of users to take proper advantage of it. One hopes the PS5 \u2014 which is allegedly code-named \u201cProspero\u201d \u2014 will offer a version of this a bit earlier. The ability to play your games on a smaller screen, thus having some flexibility and not being constantly tied to the same stationary black box console, will be even more important as the PS5 will have to compete with the likes of Google\u2019s Stadia and Apple Arcade. It\u2019s not as flexible as, say, this cloud gaming thing everyone\u2019s so keen on, but it\u2019s definitely better than nothing.\n\nThe 7.00 update also brings a small benefit to iOS users as well: those who\u2019re running the new iOS/iPadOS 13 can now hook up their Dualshock 4 controllers to their iOS devices via Bluetooth. That means you can play PS4 games on your iPhone with your PS4 controller. It\u2019ll be almost as good as Remote Play on the Vita was! (And no, I\u2019m still not over the Vita and probably won\u2019t be for a long time, don\u2019t @ me.)\n\nThe update also doubles the size of PlayStation parties \u2014 now 16 people can join. The PS4 Second Screen app also supports a new Chat Transcription feature that, as the name suggests, will convert spoken party chat to a written transcript. Parties also have a new tab where users can enter text that\u2019ll be read aloud to other party members. Currently this is only available in the US, but we\u2019ve contacted Sony to ask about its release in other countries.\n\nIf you wanna see a quick-and-dirty guide for how to get started on Remote Play, you can check out the guide we wrote from an iOS device. The basic steps from within the app appear to be the same.\n\nThe update is launching worldwide later this week.\n\nPS4 System Software Update 7.00 Launches This Week on PlayStation Blog\n\nRead next: NYU professor says Tesla will fail, Elon Musk makes fart noises", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F03%2FRemote-Play-4.jpg&signature=3112e280506ad0a32fc9165b6fc4df23", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
