He was credible in his testimony that he believed what he was told.\u201d\n\nNeither Dwyer nor his advisers contacted USADA, which runs a hot-line for athletes with questions about drugs and supplements.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that Mr. Dwyer did not take advantage of this support and hopefully this case will convince others to do so in order to protect fair and healthy competition for all athletes,\u201d Tygart said.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 US swimmer Conor Dwyer, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, has been suspended 20 months for doping after an arbitration panel", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/e7ccb0_us-olympic-swimmer-conor-dwyer-has-received-20-month-ban-doping-abitrators-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
