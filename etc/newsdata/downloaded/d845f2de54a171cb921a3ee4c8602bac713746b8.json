Co-starring Steve Carell and Jennifer Aniston, Witherspoon plays Bradley Jackson, an intrepid, determined, and notably brunette on-air reporter. Notable because Reese \u201cLegally Blonde\u201d Witherspoon and her flowing golden locks are not only iconic, they\u2019re one of the few remaining things that give us hope. But we get it \u2014 change is good. \u201cI had just gotten done playing Madeline in Big Little Lies and I wanted to do some stuff that was different,\u201d she explained to Entertainment Weekly.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like my character would be concerned with her hair or maintaining a certain hair color,\u201d Witherspoon added. \u201cShe\u2019s a very low-maintenance, pragmatic person. She\u2019s an on-air traveling news reporter when we first meet her, so she literally has to be ready on the fly.\u201d Enter Reese\u2019s milk-chocolate wig, flowing like the river in Willy Wonka\u2019s Chocolate Factory. \u201cI think we tried the blonde and then we tried a brown wig and when we saw it, it felt so different,\u201d showrunner Kerry Ehrin agreed. \u201cAnd Bradley is just a little bit of a darker character. We just saw her as a little more dark and sarcastic and cynical.\u201d To be able to convey all of this, that is one powerful wig. The Emmys better prep an Outstanding Wig for a Drama Series category because otherwise it\u2019s coming for Supporting Actress.", "description": "Iconic blonde Reese Witherspoon requested to have a brown wig to play her character, Bradley Jackson, on \u2018The Morning Show.\u2019", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/13/13-reese-witherspoon-the-morning-show.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
