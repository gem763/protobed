On security. On trade. On finance. On anything where we need the co-operation of others to solve problems we can\u2019t solve ourselves.\n\n\"And if we don\u2019t like the outcome, guess what? We don't have to sign or ratify.\"\n\nIn his address to the Lowy Institute foreign policy think tank last week, Mr Morrison warned Australia's sovereignty was at risk from a \"a negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill-defined borderless global community and, worse still, an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy\".\n\nHe announced an audit on Australia's involvement in multilateral organisations. While not advocating withdrawal, Mr Morrison pledged Australia would play a more active role in setting rules and standards, particularly in matters related to the economy,investment and trade.\n\nMr Morrison confirmed a day later that one of the sources of his ire was international condemnation of the government's hardline treatment of asylum-seekers to deter boat arrivals.\n\nBut Mr Rudd, the Labor prime minister from 2007 to 2010 and briefly in 2013, said Mr Morrison offered a \"curious piece of foreign policy logic\" that did not stack up.\n\n\"Who is Morrison talking about here? The UN? The IMF? The World Bank?The WTO? The G20?\" Mr Rudd wrote.\n\n\"Having advanced the \u201cevil globalist\u201d argument, he doesn\u2019t bother letting us in on which institution(s) is the problem. In other words, he offers no proof of the case he\u2019s making.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Rudd said the \"inconvenient truth\" was Mr Morrison's speech was not about foreign policy at all and instead focused on \"crude domestic politics\".\n\n\"It\u2019s throwing a big slab of red meat to the Duttonista far right, the Hansonites, and even certain Christian fundamentalists who have long railed about the evils of \u201cone world government\u201d. And it\u2019s about wedging Labor,\" Mr Rudd wrote.\n\n\"The telltale line in Morrison\u2019s speech paraphrasing John Howard says it all: 'We will decide our interests and the circumstances in which we seek to pursue them.' Whatever that means. Is he saying there are circumstances in which we won\u2019t pursue our national interests?\"\n\nMr Rudd also accused the Coalition of hypocrisy, saying despite campaigning against Labor's successful bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council, \"once in office you couldn\u2019t keep the Liberals away from New York\".\n\n\"Our position has been squandered,\" he wrote. \"The cry around the world today is 'what\u2019s happened to Australia?' We\u2019ve become a little Australia.\"", "description": "Kevin Rudd says Scott Morrison is wrong in claiming unaccountable international institutions and bureaucrats are a threat to Australia's sovereignty.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2129%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/01692f0b31b1806b19ff3650833e27588967cddd", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
