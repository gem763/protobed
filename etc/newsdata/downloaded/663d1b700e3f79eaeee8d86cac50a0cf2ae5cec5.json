Customers for the units, known as collaborative robots because they work alongside human staffers, include Office Depot Inc., Lockheed Martin Corp. and XPO Logistics Inc.\n\nFounded in 2015, Waltham, Mass.-based 6 River Systems includes veterans from warehouse robotics company Kiva Systems, which was bought by Amazon.com Inc. in 2012 and became the foundation of the e-commerce giant\u2019s push to automate its fulfillment operations.\n\nThe company raised $25 million in Series B funding last year. Ottawa-based Shopify provides internet shopping platforms and other services that help customers such as Unilever PLC, Kylie Cosmetics and footwear maker Allbirds Inc. sell items online. Newsletter Sign-up Earlier this year, Shopify rolled out a service offering customers access to a network of dedicated U.S. fulfillment centers to store and ship consumer goods for online orders, a move aimed at helping retailers speed up delivery as they compete with Amazon. Automation is gaining more traction among logistics companies and online fulfillment providers as they push to ship products faster to consumers. Warehouse operators also are competing for workers in an extremely tight labor market. Proponents of collaborative robots say they can be added quickly to distribution centers to boost output more efficiently and cheaply than conventional automation systems such as conveyor belts. Shopify Chief Executive Tobi L\u00fctke said the company is pushing further into fulfillment and distribution to help small and medium-size businesses \u201caccess those things much earlier\u2026It\u2019s really tricky to scale a retail business and deliver product quickly all over the continent.\u201d Mr. L\u00fctke added that the company didn\u2019t plan to limit use of the collaborative robots by other logistics providers. \u201cWe don\u2019t see it as competition,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are building the Shopify fulfillment network primarily for people who are not using\u201d such services. The $450 million deal, consisting of 60% in cash and 40% in Shopify Class A Subordinate Voting Shares, is set to close in the fourth quarter of 2019. \u201cThis acquisition is a sign that the market is accelerating and in fact, we\u2019re on the cusp of a golden age of robotics,\u201d Matt Murphy, a managing partner at 6 River Systems investor Menlo Ventures and a member of the startup\u2019s board, wrote in a blog post on the acquisition. \u201cAs a category, \u2018logistics and warehousing\u2019 was the lowest hanging fruit for automation but it\u2019s a great example of a sector quickly transformed by automation,\u201d Mr. Murphy wrote. \u201cWe expect many more robotics companies to break out across a variety of sectors.\u201d Write to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
