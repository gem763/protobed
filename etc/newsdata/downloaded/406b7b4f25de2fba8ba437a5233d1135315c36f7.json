Fred Thompson to jump into the race in September 2007.\n\nAhead of the 2012 presidential election, Republican voters had another sizable field of White House hopefuls to choose from, but after a few debates, many in the party started asking, \u201cIs there anybody else?\u201d The appetite for a new option led Texas Gov. Rick Perry to jump into the race in August 2011.\n\nAnd as a New York Times report noted today, \u201cIt\u2019s that time of the election season for Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the last debate, just anecdotally, I\u2019ve had five or six people ask me: \u2018Is there anybody else?\u2019\u201d said Leah Daughtry, a longtime Democrat who has run two of the party\u2019s recent conventions. With doubts rising about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s ability to finance a multistate primary campaign, persistent questions about Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s viability in the general election and skepticism that Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., can broaden his appeal beyond white voters, Democratic leaders are engaging in a familiar rite: fretting about who is in the race and longing for a white knight to enter the contest at the last minute.\n\nThe Times\u2019 article referenced a variety of possible contenders who could make 11th-hour bids, including former Secretary of State John Kerry and former Attorney General Eric Holder, the latter of whom was described as \u201cconsidering a last-minute entry.\u201d\n\nFormer Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said he\u2019d been \u201cnudged by friends to reconsider\u201d his decision not to run, while Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who nearly ran, conceded that \u201cthe pressure on him to reconsider from labor leaders, Democratic officials and donors has \u2018become more frequent.\u2019\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not in a position to say with confidence whether any of these prominent Democrats, or someone else entirely, might yet throw their hat into the ring. Usually, \u201cwhite knight\u201d candidates have already launched by now, but that doesn\u2019t preclude the possibility of someone giving this a shot.\n\nThat said, given the circumstances, the fact that this appetite apparently exists in some Democratic circles is \u2026 curious.\n\nFor one thing, Democrats have the largest field of presidential candidates since the dawn of the modern American nominating process. Some contenders have dropped out, but it\u2019s still the largest field either major party has ever had. It\u2019s a diverse group of folks \u2013 it\u2019s not as if voters have 19 clones to choose between \u2013 making it tougher to justify the need for someone entirely new.\n\nFor another, as the aforementioned \u201cwhite knight\u201d candidates help prove \u2013 Clark, Thompson, Perry, et al. \u2013 late entrants invariably lose, in part because it\u2019s nearly impossible to catch up financially with established candidates.\n\nBut even if we put these relevant angles aside, there\u2019s a more obvious concern related to the 2020 cycle: Democrats don\u2019t necessarily need a \u201cwhite knight\u201d because \u2013 and this is important \u2013 they\u2019re already winning. General election polling currently shows each of the party\u2019s top contenders ahead of Donald Trump in 2020 match-ups.\n\nIf, hypothetically, the evidence showed each of the leading Democratic candidates trailing Trump by significant margins, it\u2019d be far easier to understand the party looking to the sidelines, wondering who could be brought into the game.\n\nBut as things stand, the party doesn\u2019t need a solution to a problem that doesn\u2019t appear to exist.", "description": "Every four years, it seems anxious partisans look for a \"white knight\" presidential candidate.
