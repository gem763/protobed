Both Dalhousie University in Halifax and the University of Ottawa offer mindfulness to first-year students.\n\n\"The Law Society [of Ontario] actually recommended mindfulness to improve mental health and well-being for lawyers and I think the same statement applies to law students,\" said Telfer.\n\nStudies have shown that lawyers experience high rates of depression, anxiety and substance abuse.\n\nStudies find that lawyers experience higher rates of depression, anxiety and substance abuse.

Twenty per cent showed signs of \"alcohol-dependent drinking.\"\n\nA 2017 University of Toronto study found lawyers were more likely to experience depressive symptoms as they gained success in their field .\n\nTeaches students to respond, not react\n\nTelfer discovered mindfulness while receiving treatment in hospital for depression. After a suicide attempt in 2016, he decided to adopt mindfulness and was \"determined\" to offer it to his students.\n\nHe first launched Mindfulness Ambassadors, a non-credit mindfulness program for law students based on a program by the organization Mindfulness Without Borders, at Western in 2017.\n\n\"I really didn't know what the student reaction would be or the demand,\" he said. \"To my surprise, in the first year I offered it, it filled within a day and a half.\"\n\nLong hours can lead to a poor work-life balance for lawyers. Studies say that has a impact on lawyers' mental health. (Shutterstock)\n\nStudents don't simply learn how to meditate. Each semester begins with students examining why lawyers tend to be unhappy in their professions.\n\nThey then apply mindfulness to legal skills, like client interview negotiation and conflict resolution.\n\n\"The idea behind mindfulness is it gives you the choice in how to respond rather than to react on an automatic pilot situation,\" Telfer said.\n\nThe concept didn't come easy to Telfer, however. For years, he says he was focused on \"productivity.\" Mindfulness instead promotes a slow, thoughtful approach.\n\n\"I completely rejected the idea \u2026 it seemed non-productive to be sitting doing nothing,\" Telfer said.\n\nPositive impact\n\nNow, Telfer says he has already seen a positive change in students following his 2017 mindfulness pilot program.\n\n\"I've been an academic for 25 years and ... the feedback after the course is something I've never experienced as an academic. It was quite unique,\" he said.\n\nOne student shared with Telfer that she practiced a meditation he calls \"Take Five\" ahead of her first law school exam.\n\nIt's a simple practice: for five seconds at a time, students focus on taking five breaths.\n\n\"[She] found that it grounded her and she was able to then go on and write the exam.\"\n\nIn a profession where work-life balance leans heavily on work and lawyers frequently experience burnout, living in the present moment \u2014 a key aspect of mindfulness \u2014 can benefit law students, Telfer argues.\n\n\"Focusing on the future can cause anxiety, as well as focusing on the past, and being present in negotiation, I think, slows things down.\"\n\nWhere to get help\n\nCanada Suicide Prevention Service\n\nToll-free 1-833-456-4566\n\nText: 45645\n\nChat: crisisservicescanada.ca\n\nIn French: Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de pr\u00e9vention du suicide: 1-866-APPELLE (1-866-277-3553)", "description": "Considered the first of its kind in Canada, the course will focus on self-awareness and mental health.
