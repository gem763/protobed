Trump Sees \u2018Warmer Feelings\u2019 as Schumer Sounds Off: Trade Update\n\n(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump continued to send positive vibes about getting a trade deal with China.\n\nBut as day two of U.S.-China trade talks got under way, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is criticizing any deal that would include breaks for Huawei Technologies Co., the Chinese telecom giant that\u2019s raised national-security concerns in Washington.\n\n\u201cA China mini deal? It must not include concessions on Huawei,\u201d he tweeted just before the Chinese delegation arrived at the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s offices. \u201cThat\u2019s what China wants most, and it would show tremendous weakness.\u201d\n\nChinese Delegation Arrives for Day Two (Earlier)\n\nVice Premier Liu He and his team arrived around 9 a.m. and was greeted by USTR Robert Lighthizer, who\u2019s celebrating his 72nd birthday on Friday, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Liu has a scheduled meeting with Trump at the White House at 2:45 p.m.\n\nThe talks led by Liu and Lighthizer are the first senior-level in-person talks since late July to try and end an 18-month trade war that is taking a toll on the global economy and U.S. manufacturing.\n\nStocks rose in Asia, Europe and the U.S. partly on expectations for a tariff ceasefire.\n\nOther key developments:\n\nForeign firms have a clear road map for full ownership of financial services companies in China. Overseas institutions can apply for total control of onshore ventures starting in 2020, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said Friday.\n\nMarkets cheered positive trade developments for China, the U.S. and Europe.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Steve Bannon told CNBC he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised if they saw some interim deal.\u201d\n\nChina plans to ask the U.S. to lift sanctions on its biggest shipping company at this week\u2019s talks.\n\nSoybean prices are higher this week partly on expectations China will purchase more from the U.S.\n\nTrump Says Day One of Talks Went Well (Earlier)\n\nTrump on Thursday said the first day of high-level trade negotiations between the U.S. and China on Thursday went \u201cvery well\u201d and that he plans to meet with the top Chinese negotiator Friday.\n\n\u201cWe just completed a negotiation with China, we\u2019re doing very well, we\u2019re having another one tomorrow. I\u2019m meeting with the vice premier over at the White House, and I think it\u2019s going really well,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see them tomorrow, right here, and it\u2019s going very, very well.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and China have both appeared willing to work toward a partial deal, and leave the more controversial issues for later discussions. However, Trump repeated on Wednesday that he would prefer a complete agreement. The core U.S. demands would commit China to cracking down on the alleged theft of intellectual property and stop forcing U.S. companies to hand over their commercial secrets as a condition of doing business in China.\n\nWithout progress, the U.S. is due to increase tariffs on about $250 billion of Chinese imports to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. More duties on $160 billion of Chinese imports are due Dec. 15.", "description": "Trump Sees \u2018Warmer Feelings\u2019 as Schumer Sounds Off: Trade Update", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE8L0VY_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
