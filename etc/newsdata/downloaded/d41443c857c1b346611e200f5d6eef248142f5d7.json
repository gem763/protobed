The oil giant will gauge market conditions and assess feedback from a roadshow for potential cornerstone investors that ends this week before giving the final go ahead, the people said.\n\nAramco is speeding up preparations for the IPO with an aim of listing on the Saudi bourse as soon as November, Bloomberg News has reported. People involved in the deal say about 2 per cent of Aramco may be sold, which could raise US$40 billion. The firm is targeting a valuation of at least US$2 trillion \u2014 more than double that of Apple Inc. The sale is key to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s strategy to fund the diversification of the OPEC nation\u2019s economy.\n\nInvestment banks\u2019 research teams are in the midst of preparing pre-IPO reports on Aramco, according to an internal schedule seen by Bloomberg. Analysts had barely three weeks to get them done, compared with six-to-eight weeks they normally get for some of the biggest global listings.\n\nEach bank\u2019s team needed to finish a first draft of their analysis by Oct. 9, with second drafts due Oct. 15. The reports need to be finalized and printed by Oct. 18, so they can be ready to be distributed to fund managers once Aramco announces its intention to float on Oct. 20, the schedule shows.\n\nWhile Aramco is likely to move ahead with the listing, no final decision has been made and the Saudis could still decide to delay or cancel the IPO, the people said. Aramco officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email request for comment.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Aramco is speeding up preparations for the IPO with an aim of listing on the Saudi bourse as soon as November", "authors": ["Matthew Martin", "Dinesh Nair", "Archana Narayanan", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/aramco.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
