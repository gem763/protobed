But that isn\u2019t convincing everyone to convert.\n\nEven though the number of publicly traded master-limited partnerships dwindled by more than one-third in the past four years as enthusiasm for the model waned, a few stalwarts are keeping the structure, saying any possible benefits are overshadowed by the tax hit investors would incur.\n\nWith the tax burden -- and additional governance measures -- that come from converting, even the promise of a higher market value and lower borrowing costs might not be enough to change minds. The giants of the pipeline partnership space -- Energy Transfer LP and Enterprise Products Partners LP -- aren\u2019t signaling any imminent plans to ditch the MLP model.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like something Energy Transfer or Enterprise would want to do,\u201d said Simon Lack, a managing partner at SL Advisors LLC, which advises family offices and institutional investors. Being a partnership \u201cisn\u2019t impeding them from growing because they\u2019re just funding their growth projects internally and with a little bit of debt.\u201d\n\nMaster limited partnerships, or MLPs, that once dominated the U.S. pipeline sector have become an endangered species since the crude-market crash of 2014-2016 diminished access to capital markets and investors frowned on dilutive new equity issuances that historically powered the sector\u2019s growth planes.\n\nPipeline corporations traded at 11.4 times earnings during the second quarter, excluding taxes and other expenses, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. That compared to 10 times earnings for their MLP counterparts. And while the corporations are trading at multiples in line with the five-year average, the big MLPs are about 17% below the trendline.\n\nMoreover, for the past year corporations like Kinder Morgan Inc., Oneok Inc. and Enbridge Inc. have beaten the units of Energy Transfer and Enterprise.\n\nFor the billionaire founding families behind Energy Transfer and Enterprise, the biggest deterrent to conversion may be the multimillion-dollar tax obligations they would invite by abandoning the MLP haven, Lack said.\n\nThe Duncan family, whose late patriarch Dan Duncan founded Enterprise, owns roughly a third of the Houston-based pipeline operator. Kelcy Warren, founder and chief executive officer of Energy Transfer, holds a 9.4% in the limited partner and controls the general partner.\n\nTax Burdens\n\nThe tax bill that would come with being a corporation would come in around $340 million a year for the Duncans, according to Lack\u2019s calculations. For Warren, the bill would be about $65 million annually, based on last year\u2019s net income, but \u201cthat figure will increase over the next few years,\u201d Lack said.\n\nEnterprise spokesman Rick Rainey declined to comment on \u201csuch rank and uninformed speculation.\u201d Energy Transfer also declined to comment.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like paying tax. We don\u2019t think our unitholders like us to subject them to tax,\u201d Warren said on a conference call last year. \u201cHowever, if we find that there\u2019s compelling reason that if we have the c-corp currency that would help us fund our growth, help all of our unitholders, then we are certainly open to that, and we\u2019ll continually look at it.\u201d\n\nThe pipeline-partnership structure, pioneered by Texas billionaire Rich Kinder in the 1990s, flourished during the first decade-and-a-half of the century, when the number publicly-traded MLPs reached about 90. But Kinder was among the first to abandon the model when the tax benefits began to be eroded by higher borrowing costs.\n\n$54 Billion Enterprise\n\nIn a sweeping $44 billion, 2014 consolidation, Kinder rolled MLPs he controlled into a single corporation: Kinder Morgan Inc. Although the makeover lowered investor payouts, it left the company holding more cash to fund new projects or acquire rivals, Kinder said at the time.\n\nIn the latest swipe at the MLP model, Elliott Management Corp. on Wednesday urged Marathon Petroleum Corp. to pursue a breakup that would include converting its pipeline MLP to a corporation and spinning off some of the shares to Marathon Petroleum investors.\n\nElliott estimated Marathon Petroleum\u2019s pipeline business has an enterprise value of about $54 billion, on par with that of Kinder, according to a 45-page presentation published Wednesday.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Pipeline owners that ditched a partnership structure in favor of becoming corporations are performing better than their tax-shielded peers.
