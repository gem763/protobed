Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Dolphins continued their roster overhaul Monday, releasing long snapper John Denney, a fixture in Miami since 2005.\n\nDenney, 40, made 224 consecutive appearances for the Dolphins, not missing a game in his 14 seasons.\n\nHe issued a statement Monday morning.\n\n\u201cToday, unfortunately, marks the end of my time with the Miami Dolphins,\u201d Denney said in a statement. \u201cI want to thank the Dolphins for giving me a chance back in 2005. Over the last 14 years I have had many wonderful, hard working teammates, all of whom I would like to thank.\n\n\u201cI also want to thank all of the coaches I have worked with in Miami.\u201d\n\nThere were plenty of those: Nick Saban, Cam Cameron, Tony Sparano, Joe Philbin and Adam Gase.\n\nDenney did not announce if he would retire or pursue a new team.\n\nThe decision to cut Denney came as a surprise since he had beaten undrafted free agent Wesley Farnsworth for the job. The Dolphins cut Farnsworth when trimming the roster to the league-mandated 53 on Saturday.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The Dolphins continued their roster overhaul Monday, releasing long snapper John Denney, a fixture in Miami since 2005.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425472236&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811H2-OCASP"}
