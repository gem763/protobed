Elizabeth Warren speaks at the One Iowa and GLAAD LGBTQ Presidential Forum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, September 20, 2019. (Scott Morgan/Reuters)\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren called for placing transgender prisoners in detention facilities designed for the opposite biological sex in a new LGBTQ rights plan released Thursday.\n\n\u201cI will direct the Bureau of Prisons to end the Trump Administration\u2019s dangerous policy of imprisoning transgender people in facilities based on their sex assigned at birth,\u201d Warren wrote in the plan.\n\nUnder the plan, transgender inmates would be placed in detention facilities that correspond to their gender identity rather than their biological sex, and would be entitled to tax-payer funded gender transition surgeries.\n\nBoth Warren and fellow candidate Joe Biden have expressed support for tax-payer funded transition surgeries before. At a September 20 Iowa LGBTQ conference, Biden said that the surgery should be covered by Obamacare.\n\nIn January of this year, Warren changed her stance on government-funded transition surgeries after it emerged that she had dismissed the notion that taxpayers should fund the cosmetic procedure in a 2012 interview.\n\n\u201cI have to say, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good use of taxpayer dollars,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nBill de Blasio also declared his support for tax-payer funded gender transition surgery in July during his own presidential bid. De Blasio has since dropped out of the Democratic primary field following lackluster poll results.\n\nWarren has consistently run to the left of the Democratic field on social issues since beginning her candidacy. On Wednesday she released a plan designed to combat climate change and \u201cclimate injustice,\u201d pledging to invest $1.5 trillion over a decade to stop global warming and to help minority communities allegedly disproportionately affected by the warming.\n\n\u201cOur crisis of environmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long,\u201d the plan states.", "description": "Under the plan, transgender inmates would also be entitled to taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Jim Geraghty", "Victor Davis Hanson", "John Mccormack", "A.
