(\u201cPurpose Investments\u201d or \u201cPurpose\u201d) today announced the launch of its newest innovation, Purpose Structured Equity Yield Portfolio (\u201cthe Fund\u201d). The Fund will be available today in two mutual fund versions, Series F (management fee of 0.65%) and Series A (management fee of 1.65%).\n\n\n\nThe first of its kind in Canada, Purpose Structured Equity Yield Portfolio replicates the outcomes of multiple structured notes into a mutual fund solution. The Fund is a one-ticket solution that pairs a stable and tax-efficient yield with contingent downside protection built in via an actively-managed derivatives-based strategy.\n\n\u201cPurpose Structured Equity Yield Portfolio provides investors with an elegant approach to adding stability with above-market yields, even while traditionally stable investments, like fixed income instruments, are seeing their returns compressed,\u201d said Som Seif, CEO and Founder of Purpose Investments.\n\nPurpose employs a multi-factor portfolio selection strategy to create a diverse portfolio with a lower correlation to broad equity markets. This includes:\n\nAnalyzing macroeconomic factors such as earnings, dividend yields, interest rates, economic/business cycles and geopolitical risks.\n\nSelecting Global and North American equity indices that have strong fundamentals, creates value and reduces risk in a portfolio.\n\nInvesting in derivatives that provide exposure to selected indices, stable income through coupon payments and contingent protection against losses.\n\n\u201cUncertainty can manifest in many different ways. One of the best strategies to guard against it is to add stability,\u201d said Greg Taylor, Chief Investment Officer, Purpose Investments. \u201cPurpose Structured Equity Yield Portfolio is an innovative, tax-efficient approach to build stability during times of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about how the Fund uniquely meets the challenges of uncertainty head-on and how it will benefit thoughtful Canadian investors, visit www.purposeinvest.com/perspectives/a-cutting-edge-canadian-first-to-combat-uncertainty-purpose-structured-equity-yield-portfolio/\n\nFor product-specific information, visit www.purposeinvest.com/funds/purpose-structured-equity-yield-portfolio\n\nAbout Purpose Investments\n\nPurpose Investments is an asset management company with more than $8 billion under management.
