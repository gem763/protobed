The UAW announced the deal's approval after voting ended Friday.\n\nEmployees will return to work as instructed by GM.\n\nThe contract was approved by 57.2%, according to The Associated Press.\n\nUAW Vice President Terry Dittes said the union is proud of the workers. \"Their sacrifice and courageous stand addressed the two-tier wages structure and permanent temporary worker classification that has plagued working class Americans.\"\n\nThe UAW says the contract includes an economic package of an $11,000 per member signing bonus, performance bonuses, two 3% annual raises and two 4% lump sum payments and holding the line on health care costs. But GM will close three U.S. factories, according to the AP.\n\nThe contract brings workers hired after 2007 up to the same wage as older workers in four years, and keeps worker health benefits with low premiums.\n\nAmong the negotiations' biggest flashpoints had been the union's famously great health benefits, opportunities for temporary workers and a greater share of the profits for hourly employees. For salaried workers \u2014 generally those involved in skilled trades \u2014 concerns centered mostly on matters of overtime, outsourcing and dispute resolution.\n\nAnd negotiators were far enough apart that after their previous contract lapsed last month, the union's nearly 50,000 GM employees voted for the work stoppage.\n\n\"This strike is about us,\" Dittes explained to NPR last month. \"It's about standing up for fair wages, for affordable, quality health care, for our share of profits and for our job security.\"\n\nIt would eventually become the longest strike against GM for decades, stretching on even after a tentative deal was announced last week and members had begun to vote on it. And the walkout's effects were felt across the country \u2014 not just by the employees and GM, which halted production at dozens of manufacturing plants and distribution warehouses, but also by a range of regional suppliers across the country that rely on feeding the automaker.", "description": "On Friday, the United Auto Workers and its nearly 50,000 GM employees signaled an end to the six-week stalemate, voting to OK a deal that the labor union struck with the automaker earlier this month.", "authors": ["Colin Dwyer", "Barbara Campbell"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/25/ap_19289632194549_wide-049270736a41b21064ad97d8526dac09822bd40b.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
