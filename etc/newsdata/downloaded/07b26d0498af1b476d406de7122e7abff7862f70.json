You\u2019ve watched the (reasonably) warm weather from your office window too much this summer. You\u2019ve tormented yourself with ideas of going it alone so you too can ditch the 9-to-5 and live life flexibly, pursuing your passion with passion.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone. There are now almost 5 million self-employed people in the UK, according to the latest UK labour market statistics.\n\nAnd that is alongside the rapidly growing number of \u201cside hustlers\u201d, people who have their own business that they run alongside their day job. Data from Henley Business School shows that almost two-fifths of employees also have a side hustle and they expect that to rise to half the adult population by 2030.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSo if you are considering making the jump and becoming self-employed, what are the things you should know before you take the plunge? We asked some of the UK\u2019s self-employed workers for their top tips for wannabe freelancers, contractors and the self-employed.\n\nHere\u2019s what they had to say.\n\nSave first\n\nDitching your day job is a big step for people who enjoy doing things like buying food and paying their mortgage or rent. Having some savings in place first can be key, as many respondents say.\n\n\u201cHave savings. It may be a slow start,\u201d says Cath Garvey, a freelance illustrator and comic artist.\n\n\u201cIf possible, have savings or some financial support to get by for a few months,\u201d agrees Thomas Ali, who runs the spice range company Freshly Spiced with his wife. \u201cWhilst you may have lots of sales coming in, you may find you have one slower month or some unexpected expenses that you hadn\u2019t planned for. You don\u2019t want to put extra pressure on yourself and family if you can avoid it.\u201d\n\nManage your money\n\nThere is a lot to do when becoming self-employed\n\n\u201cPut [a percentage] of every invoice away for tax and rainy days. Do your accounts at the end of each month, not each year,\u201d says Chris Ford. He\u2019s a senior lecturer in sports journalism at the University of Gloucestershire and also provides freelance services.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s just one element of success. He adds: \u201cBe nice to everyone you meet in the working world from the cleaner to the CEO.\u201d\n\nConsider getting an accountant\n\nNot every self-employed person needs an accountant and it is an extra cost that some may prefer to avoid. But lots of people told us that getting an accountant was key to making it work well.\n\n\u201cGet an accountant,\u201d urges Sarah Thorp, founder of Cobalt Communications. \u201cIt\u2019s time-saving so you can be working, money-saving \u2013 so you don\u2019t balls your tax up \u2013 and stress-saving, so you can stress about other things.\u201d\n\nNina Sawetz, founder and MD of PR agency Future, agrees: \u201c[It\u2019s] amazing how many people think it\u2019s not worth it, and then struggle when HMRC bombard them with filing notifications. They are cheaper than you think and it\u2019s absolutely worth it.\u201d\n\nSet work/life boundaries\n\nWhen you\u2019re an employee it can be difficult to stop work from creeping into your home life. For many self-employed people, it\u2019s the other way around.\n\n\u201cMake sure people know you\u2019re at work when you\u2019re at work,\u201d recommends Joe, the man behind the ThriftyDad blog. \u201cWorking from home my extended family think I\u2019m available whenever they need me to do whatever chores they need - pick up nieces from school, available for a brew and a chat whenever. I\u2019m working! Set some boundaries and put a lock on the office door.\u201d\n\nUse some tech\n\nThere may never have been a better time to go freelance than today, with so many apps and software packages out there designed to help.\n\nMelissa Cole, the author of The Beer Kitchen, says that tech can really help self-employed people stay on top of their finances. \u201cResearch the free accounting packages out there, like Wave, they make your life so much easier with scheduled invoices and templates,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd always, always put payment terms on your invoices, and get a contact in the accounts dept to avoid annoying the in-house contact that gives you work.\u201d\n\nTry to enjoy it\n\nFind a job you love and you\u2019ll never work a day \u2013 or whatever the saying. But when you are freelancing, that enjoyment becomes even more important.\n\nSimon Paine is co-founder and CEO of the PopUp Business School and says: \u201cOnce you\u2019ve made sales, you\u2019ll know if you are really cut out for self-employment. It does feel different and enjoyment is key. It\u2019s not just about being passionate about your work, it\u2019s enjoying the activity that you have to do every day to make it work, and that isn\u2019t for everybody.\n\n\u201cDo a little bit every day to grow your business. Remember to make time to connect with people \u2013 it\u2019s easy to get lonely and melancholy if you spend too much time alone.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t work with just anyone\n\nIf you have the wrong clients, you will spend a lot of your time chasing bills and satisfying endless additional questions and requests.\n\nAndrea San Pedro, the founder of ASP PR, says it\u2019s worth vetting clients before taking them on: \u201cBe choosy with which businesses you work; you must vet them for reliability and integrity of character in order to make an educated assessment on whether they\u2019ll be an ideal client. There are plenty of businesses out there who treat the small guys with disrespect. There is no place for those kinds of people in enterprise.\u201d\n\nLook before you leap\n\nMany British workers have a side hustle and for many, that is one way of easing the shock.\n\n\u201cMy best tip would be to start it as a side hustle before making the full jump,\u201d says freelance search engine optimisation worker Ryan Scollon. \u201cIt can be a big shock when you get close to payday and realise you don\u2019t have that big paycheque that you have become accustomed to in your full-time job.\n\n\u201cStart doing work in the evenings and weekends. It will be difficult and you will feel a complete lack of social life, but it makes the transition much easier as it allows you to have some work and momentum on your first day as a self-employed.\u201d\n\nFind some support\n\nWith a growing army of freelancers and contractors out there, it\u2019s easier than ever to find support from organisations and peers. And lots of self-employed people recommend doing so.\n\n\u201cJoin a small business organisation like Enterprise Nation or the Federation of Small Businesses,\u201d suggests Emma Maslin, a chartered accountant who works as a money coach and mentor. \u201cFor a small fee, you\u2019ll get expert guidance on so many things from legal to marketing and everything in between.\u201d\n\nChloe Jepps, head of research at the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE), agrees: \u201cRemember you aren\u2019t alone. One in seven of the working population is self-employed so you are in good company. Joining a group like IPSE will give you support and advice, as well as networking opportunities to connect with other freelancers.\u201d\n\nKnow your worth\n\nChoosing a rate and sticking to it can be really hard, especially in the early days when work may feel hard to come by.\n\nDom Burch, the MD of strategic marketing consultancy Why Social?, has a fairly bold rule for setting pay expectations. He says: \u201cWork out your day rate. Double it. Take a deep breath. Say it out loud. Don\u2019t apologise. It\u2019s not a day rate, it\u2019s 20 years or whatever of experience, insight, knowledge and network. They can always say no or offer less.\u201d\n\nAs many self-employed workers will attest, that last tip may be easier said than done.", "description": "It\u2019s no good.
