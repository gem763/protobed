Two of the big differences: (1) elimination of TIAA Real Estate; and (2) change of TIAA to an RC (basically we are losing the 3% guarantee, as the new TIAA account will have a guarantee of between 1% - 3%).\n\nI still want to have some exposure to real estate in my portfolio; however since I already own some REITS in my mutual funds I am going to trim to percentage of real estate to just 5% of my portfolio. Rather than TREA, the monies will be in Vanguard's Real Estate Index Institutional fund, VGSNX. I have always considered TREA to be something \"unique\" to REITS, so I was always willing to hold a larger percentage. Does my cut back (to 5%) given my REIT option make sense? Or am i over thinking this?\n\nRegarding the TIAA change from a guarantee between 1% - 3% is just disappointing.", "description": "My university is making changes to our plan.
