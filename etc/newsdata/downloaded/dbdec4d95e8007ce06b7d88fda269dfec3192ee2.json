The airline took them to court and in April the grounding notices were set aside but a renewed audit was set to take place.\n\nDuring this time CemAir's operating certificates expired its annual renewal date, and on 17 October 2019 the airline received its renewal which was finalised on Friday last week.\n\n\"We respect the authority and decisions of the Civil Aviation Appeal Committee, an independent panel constituted by the Department of Transport to adjudicate the actions of the SACAA,\" says CemAir in a statement.\n\n\"We note the contents of the SACAA\u2019s press releases and highlight with concern the inconsistencies between these statements and the 29 April 2019 judgement.\n\nREAD: What you need to know about the SACAA 5-phase approval to get SA Express flying again\n\n\"We apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused throughout this ordeal. We realise that many thousands of travellers were stranded and hundreds of jobs lost directly and indirectly as a result of the SACAA\u2019s illegal actions. We continue to process refunds and can now (at a customer\u2019s election) offer a credit towards future travel.\"\n\nAccording to SACAA, the certificates issued allows the airline to operate a fleet of six aircraft comprising of five Dash 8 that will operate under Part 121, as well as one Bombardier CL600-2D24, commonly referred to as CRJ900.\n\nFor Part 135 operations, the airline will utilise one Beechcraft 1900D aircraft, and at this point only one aircraft has been approved for operation. Out of a fleet of 21 aircraft, CemAir is authorised to operate only seven aircraft at this stage.\n\n\"The rest will return to service as and when CemAir presents them to the SACAA for inspection and evaluation and they are found to be compliant,\" says SACAA in their statement.\n\n\"The SACAA will continue to monitor to ensure that CemAir\u2019s operations are compliant to the obligations required for holders of such approvals as prescribed in the civil aviation regulations.\"\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
