Born in Blenheim Castle, grandson of the Duke of Marlborough, he embodied the English aristocracy, becoming a maverick rebel of a politician and taking on Hitler, the German dictator, at a time when Wold War II was underway with the Nazi threat looming. The British empire was at risk. It was also a time when women were hardly even second-class citizens, scrambling for low-level jobs and excluded from social or political prominence. From their ranks Churchill chose his secretaries, which was hardly an accolade in those days, but they emerged as a new breed who are credited with helping him win the war.\n\nThose who became part of the prime minister\u2019s army were armed with pencils and notepads and the conviction that they were better than anyone thought they were, on many levels \u2014 and working for Churchill let them prove it. And it was no fun. They worked day and night doing what their boss called \u201ctaking down,\u201d which meant bringing to life the words that became immortal to a nation struggling to survive.\n\nIn the foreword, Randolph Churchill, the prime minister\u2019s grandson, emphasizes that these women endured Winston\u2019s behavior under the most trying of circumstances. \u201cThis is Churchill at work \u2026 under severe stress, with work habits that could only be described as eccentric.\u201d\n\nAs told in oral histories, diaries and memoirs, a Churchill secretary\u2019s working day began invariably at 8 a.m. in his bedroom, where he began to read papers and dictate his famous \u201caction day memoranda\u201d on everything from the conduct of the war to his next home production project. He dictated, army officers talked, secretaries scribbled frantically, a pet budgerigar perched on his head, his cigar was lit. \u201cA veritable circus\u201d was how one secretary described it. And he was not easy to work for.\n\nHe was a man of his time, impatient, arrogant and brilliant yet oddly lovable to a group of women drawn from all levels of society who displayed the kind of loyalty that verged on devotion and who often returned to work for him after the war. They were what Churchill called his \u201csecret circle,\u201d the author writes.\n\n\u201cYou can hear in their voices the self-confidence that allowed them to serve without being servile to work when confronted with a boss in his bed or his bath.\u201d In private they called him \u201cthe old man\u201d and built their own world that clashed yet meshed with his. And they accepted the limitations that still governed social life in Britain.\n\nThe author emphasizes, \u201cThese extraordinary women tell us much about the man that we could not learn from his self-description or from reports of colleagues to whom he had reason to defer, to charm or to heed. We see through the eyes of these women what Churchill, a consummate actor, revealed of himself \u2026 how he treated his subordinates, women he had no reason to impress. It is to these tales that we turn.\u201d\n\nMs. Stelzer has come up with an extraordinary collection of memories from women who were as extraordinary as their boss because they understood each other in a way that transcended the social and the mundane. They treasured Churchill and he treasured them. For its insight into small strange world, the book should be treasured.\n\n\u2022 Muriel Dobbin is a former White House and national political reporter for McClatchy newspapers and the Baltimore Sun.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nWORKING WITH WINSTON: THE UNSUNG WOMEN BEHIND BRITAIN\u2019S GREATEST STATESMAN\n\nBy Cita Stelzer\n\nForeword by Randolph Churchill\n\nPegasus, $28.95, 400 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
