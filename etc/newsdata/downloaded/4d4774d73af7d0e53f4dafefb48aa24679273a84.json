He was 29 years old at the time.\n\n\u201cI should have known better, but I didn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Trudeau told reporters on an airplane that was transporting the Canadian leader and media during the fall election campaign. \u201cI am really sorry\u2026I am disappointed and pissed off.\u201d\n\nThe photo marks a blow for Mr. Trudeau at the early stages of a campaign ahead of Oct. 21 elections, as polls show his Liberal Party in a dead heat with the Conservative Party.\n\nMr. Trudeau has positioned himself as a global champion of an inclusive, diverse society. Through the years, he has castigated political rivals who have challenged his government\u2019s moves to boost immigration. One of his most common refrains in his nearly four-year term is that diversity is Canada\u2019s strength.\n\nPolling indicated the Canadian public \u201cbelieves the Prime Minister is more sensitive to identity issues and that he\u2019s more mature\u201d compared with his political rivals, said Darrell Bricker, president of Canadian polling firm Ipsos Global Affairs. \u201cThat is now threatened.\u201d\n\nThe photo, from the school yearbook, was published Wednesday by Time.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was racist at the time,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said, \u201cbut now I recognize it was something racist to do.\u201d Asked if there were similar incidents, he told reporters that when he was in high school, he dressed up at a talent show, also in makeup, and sang \u201cDay O.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian leader\u2019s personal popularity has sustained a significant hit in 2019 over allegations he and his senior aides tried to interfere in the criminal prosecution of a Montreal engineering company. A federal ethics watchdog ruled last month that Mr. Trudeau broke the law in his role in the affair.\n\nThe Liberal Party from the outset of the election campaign has issued damaging research about previous indiscretions from political opponents that the Liberals argued highlighted intolerance of minorities. The strategy worked in part by forcing opponents to pivot on the campaign trail. The 2001 photo potentially neutralizes that strategy, said Duane Bratt, political science professor at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta.\n\nThe photo immediately drew a rebuke from political rivals and representatives for Canada\u2019s Muslim community.\n\n\u201cSeeing the Prime Minister in brownface/blackface is deeply saddening,\u201d said Mustafa Farooq, executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims in a written statement. \u201cThe wearing of blackface/brownface is reprehensible, and hearkens back to a history of racism, slavery, and an Orientalist mythology that is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Trudeau\u2019s apology, the council issued a tweet thanking the prime minister for his contrition.\n\nMeanwhile, the leader of Canada\u2019s left-wing New Democratic Party, Jagmeet Singh, said the photo was insulting. Mr. Singh is a Sikh and wears a turban.\n\n\u201cWhat does that say about what he thinks about people who because of who they are\u2014the color of their skin\u2014face challenges, barriers and obstacles in their life,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trudeau said he would be seeking Canadians\u2019 forgiveness through the rest of the election campaign, and would speak to Liberal Party members and cabinet members\u2014among them South Asians and Sikhs\u2014about the photo.\n\n\u201cI am going to be thinking how much harder I am going to have to continue to work to demonstrate to Canadians that I am focused on building a better world with less discrimination, less intolerance and less racism,\u201d he said. He added he would have a conversation with his children Thursday about \u201ctaking responsibility for mistakes we make\u2026and promising to do better.\u201d\n\nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized after the publication of a photo from nearly two decades ago in which he appeared at a costume party wearing brownface, saying he is disappointed in himself.", "authors": ["Paul Vieira", "Paul.Vieira Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108539/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
