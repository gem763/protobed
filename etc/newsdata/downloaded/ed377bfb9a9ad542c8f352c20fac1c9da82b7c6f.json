But turnout was only 43%.\n\nThere were clashes when Spanish national police tried to prevent people voting.\n\nThe ruling separatists in the Catalan parliament then declared independence on 27 October.\n\nAngered by that, Madrid imposed direct rule by invoking Article 155 of the constitution - a first for Spain.\n\nThe Spanish government sacked the Catalan leaders, dissolved parliament and called a snap regional election on 21 December 2017, which nationalist parties won.\n\nCarles Puigdemont, the former Catalan president, fled but is wanted in Spain accused of rebellion, as are four who fled with him. A group of 12 Catalan leaders were placed on trial in Madrid - and nine have already spent months in detention.\n\nIn June 2018, Catalan nationalists regained control of the region from Madrid's direct rule after a new government was sworn in.\n\nQuim Torra, a close ally of Mr Puigdemont, now leads the regional government.\n\nCatalonia in numbers 16% of Spain's population live in Catalonia, and it produces:\n\n25.6% of Spain's exports\n\n19% of Spain's GDP\n\n20.7% of foreign investment Getty\n\nWant to know more?", "description": "The clash between Catalonia and the Spanish government is complicated, so let's examine it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15137/production/_98272368_gettyimages-856648020.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
