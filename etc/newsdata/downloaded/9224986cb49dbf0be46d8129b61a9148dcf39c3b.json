Our focus is on growth, it\u2019s on sales, stores and customer numbers,\u201d Chief Executive Giles Hurley told reporters.\n\n\u201cPrivate ownership means we can run the business for the long term and we don\u2019t have to answer to shareholders. Plans are not going to change...Confidence from our parent company is there,\u201d Hurley added on Monday.\n\nAldi UK, which trades from about 840 stores and has a grocery market share of 8.1%, said sales increased 11% in 2018 and it gained 800,000 new customers.\n\nIt is targeting 1,200 stores by 2025 and plans to invest 1 billion pounds in stores and distribution centres across Britain over the next two years.\n\nAldi trails market leader Tesco (TSCO.L), Sainsbury\u2019s (SBRY.L), Asda (WMT.N) and Morrisons (MRW.L), but along with fellow German-owned discounter Lidl has been winning market share from the big four with new store openings.\n\nPRICE GAP\n\nBritain\u2019s food retailing sector has been transformed in the last decade by the march of Aldi and Lidl which has driven down the returns of the big four players.\n\nThey have fought back by trying to narrow the price gap, improving service and chasing greater purchasing power.\n\nFILE PHOTO: An Aldi superstore is seen in London, Britain, September 29, 2018.

Sainsbury\u2019s tried and failed to take over Asda, while Morrisons has struck wholesale deals with Amazon (AMZN.O) and convenience chain McColl\u2019s (MCLSM.L).\n\nAldi UK reported an operating profit of 197.9 million pounds for the year to Dec. 31 2018, down from 265.9 million pounds in 2017. Sales were 11.33 billion pounds, with customer numbers up 5% to 16.6 million.\n\nAldi\u2019s operating margin fell from 2.6% in 2017 to 1.75% in 2018, which analysts at Barclays said was the lowest since 2010.\n\n\u201cThe lower the margin goes then the sooner the point will be reached when it is harder to justify so many new store openings,\u201d the Barclays analysts said.\n\nAldi attributed the profit fall to price cuts, saying its price advantage over the big four was 24% on an average basket of everyday items. It said while its operating margin had fallen, it had improved in the current year.\n\nIn 2017 Aldi\u2019s profit had risen for the first time in four years.\n\nHurley said like-for-like sales, stripping out the impact of new space, were positive in 2018 and so far in 2019.\n\nLONDON CALLING\n\nAldi said it would step up the pressure on rivals by increasing store numbers in London from 45 to 100 by the end of 2025, by opening more standard-sized Aldi stores and new, smaller-format \u2018Local\u2019 stores on London high streets.\n\nWhile Aldi\u2019s London market share is just 3.4%, Hurley said there was scope to eventually have 250 stores in the capital.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nHe said Aldi was better placed for a disorderly Brexit than rivals because it has a much smaller range of products, while 75% of what it sells comes from British-based suppliers and manufacturers.\n\nLike its rivals Aldi has stockpiled ambient goods, such as tinned tomatoes and olive oil, said the CEO, adding that he could not guarantee there will not be shortages of some fresh products.", "description": "German discount supermarket group Aldi plans to pump 1 billion pounds into Britain, chasing market share at the expense of profit, which dropped by 26% last year as it pursued sales growth, store openings and new customers.", "authors": ["James Davey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430382314&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0IL", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
