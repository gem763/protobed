The service grew out of AT&T;\u2019s $81 billion purchase of Time Warner, which AT&T; has overhauled and rechristened WarnerMedia.\n\nHBO Max will challenge Netflix alongside Disney , Comcast and Apple . It has not yet announced pricing. But the company said at a Tuesday event that it will launch a version of HBO Max with ads in 2021, a new twist for a brand that is known for its lack of ads. The company wants to reach 50 million subscribers in the U.S. by 2025.\n\nThe service will offer movies and programs from HBO and the Warner library, including \u201cFriends ,\u201d which it will pull back from Netflix. Other hits like \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d and \u201cSouth Park\u201d will also be available.\n\nIt\u2019s aiming for kids with \u201cSesame Street\u201d and an Elmo talk show. And it will have superhero movies from DC.\n\nThe service will also launch 50 original series in the first year, half targeted to younger adults and the remainder split between shows for kids and for adults. The service won\u2019t release a season\u2019s worth of episodes all at once, as Netflix typically does.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "AT&T said its HBO Max streaming service will launch in May, joining a crowded field.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tali Arbel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/29/at_t_hbo_max_87050_c139-0-2835-1573_s1200x700.jpg?eccf02cd0881eed30c6863c2605b38f6584576d7", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
