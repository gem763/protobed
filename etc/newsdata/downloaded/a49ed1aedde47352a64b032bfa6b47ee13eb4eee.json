REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s Liberal Democrats party on Sunday toughened its anti-Brexit stance, formally adopting a policy to stop the country from leaving the European Union if it wins power at a national election.\n\nThe party holds just 18 seats in Britain\u2019s 650-seat parliament but has cast itself as the only \u2018Stop Brexit\u2019 party, hoping to pick up votes from the 16 million who voted to remain in the EU in 2016 and win enough seats to form what would be an unprecedented Liberal Democrat government.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, a Conservative, is promising to leave the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a Brexit deal. But the policy has divided his own party, costing him his majority in parliament and making an early general election likely.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats party conference on Sunday voted to formally adopt a policy to revoke the \u2018Article 50\u2019 notice filed in March 2017 which notified the EU of Britain\u2019s intention to quit the bloc. This would effectively cancel Brexit.\n\n\u201cWe will put an end there and then to the Brexit nightmare that is dragging the whole country down and tearing us apart, and start immediately tackling the reasons people voted to leave in the first place,\u201d the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said.\n\nThe decision underlines how Brexit is reshaping the country\u2019s political spectrum, with the pro-EU Liberal Democrats now at the opposite end to the pro-Brexit Conservatives. In 2010 the two formed a coalition government that lasted five years.\n\nAs a party which has never won more than 62 seats at an election, the prospect of party leader Jo Swinson forming a government is a long way off, even though British politics is at its most unpredictable juncture in decades.\n\nTwo different polls on Sunday put them 21 percentage points and 8 percentage points behind the Conservatives, and also trailing the opposition Labour Party.\n\nJohnson wants to call an election before the next scheduled one in 2022, but has so far been blocked by opponents, including the Liberal Democrats, who say they first want to make sure he cannot take Britain out of the EU without an exit deal next month.", "description": "Britain's Liberal Democrats party on Sunday toughened its anti-Brexit stance, formally adopting a policy to stop the country from leaving the European Union if it wins power at a national election.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430101681&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0BK", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
