Thrown off by the odd-looking nature of the fish, the angler took a picture and threw it back into the water, according to The New York Times. After reporting it to a state biologist, a team went back out on the water and found a two-foot snakehead fish and three juveniles.\n\nThe northern snakehead fish has reportedly been found in 15 US states, according to the Georgia Wildlife Resources Division, though they are native to waters in Asia and Africa.\n\nIn two years, a female snakehead fish can release up to 150,000 eggs, but without a competing predator outside its natural habitat to keep its population in check, the land-dwelling fish can pose a threat to local animals.\n\n\"They are a predator that eats mostly other fish, but also amphibians, small animals, frogs, lizards,\" Scott Robinson from the Wildlife Resources Division told The Times. \"It will compete with our native species for food and habitat.\"\n\nSnakehead fish survive in freshwater, The Times reported. They can grow up to three feet long and breathe air, allowing them to survive on land. The fish travel by tossing their bodies side-to-side \u2014 an equivalent to walking \u2014 according to National Geographic.\n\nRead more: The Asian Snakehead Fish That Was Found In Maryland Is Aggressive And Spreading\n\nVirginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries Biologist John Odenkirk handles a large northern snakehead fish aboard his stunboat in waters off the Potomac River, Virginia May 23, 2013.

Instead, \"kill it immediately and freeze it.\" After the capture and kill, officials say to take photos of the fish, note the location where it was caught, and then report it to Georgia's Wildlife Resources Division Fisheries Office.\n\nIn terms of preventative measures, officials wrote the following:\n\nLearn how to identify northern snakehead.\n\nDispose of aquarium animals and plants in the garbage, not in waterbodies.\n\nDispose of all bait in trash cans, at disposal stations, or above the waterline on dry land.\n\nDump water from boat compartments, bait buckets, and live wells on dry land.\n\nA large northern snakehead fish is dissected and filleted by Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries biologists Reuters/Gary Cameron\n\nThe snakehead fish is considered a delicacy, but also a danger\n\nSnakehead fish are typically harvested in farms in China for consumption. They have shown up on plates in Chinatown in Boston and New York. The fish were also once kept as aquarium pets until they proved to be too \"aggressive,\" Dr. Lynne Parenti, curator of fishes at the National Museum of Natural History, told The Times.\n\nThe fish were at one point cultured in Arkansas until a federal ban was established in 2002, making it illegal to import, transport, sell, transfer, or possess any species of snakehead fish, of which there are 29 known varieties, according to National Geographic. The species was added to an \"injurious wildlife\" list, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n\"These fish are like something from a bad horror movie,\" former Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton said in a 2002 statement. \"... They have the potential to cause enormous damage to our valuable recreational and commercial fisheries. We simply must do everything we can to prevent them from entering our waters, either accidentally or intentionally.\"", "description": "As an invasive species that can outcompete native wildlife, Georgia officials are advising residents that find the fish to \"kill it immediately.\"", "authors": ["Lauren Frias"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0071ae94e860dfd2c21e0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
