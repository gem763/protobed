Let\u2019s say you\u2019re out and about being busy and you just don\u2019t have time to wait around at home for that parcel to be delivered. But damn, it\u2019s a present for your other half and their birthday is tomorrow \u2013 you don\u2019t want it going back to the depot and there\u2019s no safe place for the courier to leave it.\n\nSo, how would you feel about the delivery driver being given access to your parked car, no matter where you\u2019ve left it, and then just dropping it off in the boot? Sounds pretty simple, right? Well, after successful testing of its \u2018We Deliver\u2019 service in Berlin, Volkswagen will make exactly that possible in the UK from next year.\n\nCall us cynical, but we can see the headlines already.\n\nVW says that security was \u201chigh on the list of priorities when developing the service\u201d but how much do you really trust your fellow humans? Apparently, the car\u2019s location will only be available to one individual courier for a limited amount of time and only the opening/closing functions of the car will be accessible to them. That is to say, they won\u2019t be able to start the engine and take your Golf R for a spin around the block.\n\nObviously, you\u2019ll need to be a VW owner to access the service. All of its cars produced in 2019, and all Touaregs produced after 2 July 2018, can take part if the owner signs up via an app.\n\nThe future is here then, and it means we can\u2019t leave anything valuable in the boot\u2026", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.topgear.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_1280w/public/images/news-article/2019/09/09e208f02f0a9e0df7b8ba7f3881f083/we_deliver.jpg?itok=EAekVMj9", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
