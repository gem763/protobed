This has led to many of the groups closing down.\n\nNavalny called the move \u201cabsolutely illegal\u201d and said it was \u201cobviously a direct order from (President Vladimir) Putin.\u201d\n\n\u201cFBK never received a single kopeck of foreign money,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nHe demanded that the justice ministry publicly prove that the foundation received funds from outside Russia.\n\nFBK, which has often been raided by authorities, said the move was an attempt to curb its activity.\n\nIts director Ivan Zhdanov said it was \u201canother attempt to suffocate\u201d the foundation.\n\nHe said the group, which seeks donations from the public, is funded \u201cexclusively by Russian citizens.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Attempt to stop activity\u2019 \u2013\n\nNavalny\u2019s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh wrote on Twitter that the decision was intended to \u201cput pressure on us and attempt to stop our activity.\u201d\n\nWhile barred from mainstream politics, Navalny has kept trying to expose the lavish wealth of Russia\u2019s elites, broadcasting the findings of his investigations to millions of Russians on social media and YouTube.\n\nThis has helped Navalny, a Yale-educated lawyer, win a young fan base in the country.\n\nIn August, Russian investigators launched a money-laundering probe into FBK, accusing it of taking money that was procured illegally.\n\nLast month, investigators raided dozens of Navalny\u2019s regional offices, as well as the homes of his supporters following mass opposition protests in Moscow this summer.\n\nNavalny blamed the raids on Kremlin \u201chysteria\u201d sparked by the ruling party\u2019s losses in local elections last month. He said police searched more than 200 addresses in 41 cities across Russia.\n\nThe charismatic anti-corruption campaigner instructed supporters to vote strategically to block pro-Kremlin candidates in Moscow\u2019s recent local election.\n\nAllies of Putin suffered major losses in the Russian capital during the September vote.\n\nNavalny organised the protests after popular opposition politicians were barred from standing in the Moscow parliament election.\n\nThe 43-year-old missed several of the demonstrations while serving a 30-day jail term for organising previous unauthorised rallies.\n\nSince emerging as the Kremlin\u2019s chief critic and a highly effective campaigner and organiser, Navalny has faced repeated legal action apparently aimed at hindering his activities.\n\nHe has often been jailed and physically attacked, but has vowed to press ahead with his campaign to change Russia.\n\nHe was barred from challenging Putin on the ballot box in Russia\u2019s 2018 presidential election.\n\nHe nonetheless toured Russia ahead of the vote in an American-style campaign to rally his supporters, and set up headquarters across the country.\n\nPutin has refused to pronounce Navalny\u2019s name in public.", "description": "Moscow (AFP) \u2013 Russia on Wednesday upped the pressure on opposition leader Alexei Navalny, declaring his organisation a \u201cforeign agent\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/55678a_russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-has-faced-repeated-legal-action-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
