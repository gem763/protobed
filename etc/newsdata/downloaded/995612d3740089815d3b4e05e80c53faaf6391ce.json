Mayor Pete Buttigieg took aim at Democratic presidential campaign rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. over her \"Medicare-for-all\" plan on Wednesday, after becoming the first major candidate to file for the ballot in New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation presidential primary.\n\nButtigieg, who grabbed headlines at this month's presidential debate for challenging Warren over how she\u2019ll pay for her plan to implement a single-payer health care system, expanded on those concerns Wednesday.\n\nNH PRIMARY GETS REAL AS FILING PERIOD GETS UNDERWAY\n\n\u201cI certainly think we all have a responsibility to explain how our plans are going to be paid for, and my concern about the plan she\u2019s putting forward is not just the multi-trillion-dollar hole but also the fact that most Americans would prefer not to be told that they have to abandon their private plan,\u201d Buttigieg said in an interview with Fox News and New Hampshire\u2019s Concord Monitor newspaper.\n\n\"I want to create this public plan and then if it\u2019s the right plan for everybody, everybody will want it,\" Buttigieg added. \"If it\u2019s not the right plan for some people, then some people will keep what they\u2019ve got. I think that\u2019s the best policy. It\u2019s definitely what most voters, including what most Democratic voters, believe. And I believe those voters are not wrong.\u201d\n\nWarren supports 2020 rival Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-all plan. Sanders has repeatedly acknowledged that taxes for most Americans would rise to pay for the program but has claimed that most people would save money in the long run due to the elimination of premiums, co-payments and deductibles. Yet at this month's debate, Warren wouldn\u2019t say if middle-class taxes would rise to pay for her Medicare-for-all system and pledged to unveil her plan for paying for it soon.\n\nWarren also returned fire at Buttigieg on the debate stage, criticizing his health care plan as \u201cMedicare for all who can afford it.\u201d\n\nWarren repeated her debate pledge while campaigning in New Hampshire Tuesday night, telling reporters: \u201cI\u2019ll have a plan out soon that shows both how much Medicare-for-all costs and how it is we\u2019re going to pay for it. It\u2019s coming out soon.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with reporters Wednesday after filing at the New Hampshire State House, Buttigieg painted clear contrasts between himself and Warren and Sanders, the two populist standard-bearers in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls.\n\n\u201cIf as a voter you\u2019ve decided you want the most ideologically left candidate possible, then of course you\u2019ve already got your choice,\u201d he said, taking an indirect jab at both Warren and Sanders. \u201cBut I think a lot of others are looking for real progressive solutions that can be achieved and that can command the support of a strong American majority. I think that\u2019s where most Democratic voters are.\u201d\n\nAnd he vowed that if he won the White House, \u201cI would be the most progressive president in my lifetime but I also would build out majorities to do these things in a way that can actually unify rather than further polarize the American people.\u201d\n\nBUTTIGIEG IN FOURTH PLACE IN NEW NH POLL, TRAILING SANDERS, WARREN AND BIDEN\n\nButtigieg arrived in the Granite State one day after a new poll from the University of New Hampshire for CNN put the one-time long-shot for the nomination in fourth place among likely Democratic primary voters, at 10 percent. Ahead of him were Sanders, I-Vt., at 21 percent, Warren at 18 percent, and former Vice President Joe Biden at 15 percent.\n\nThe 37-year old candidate, the youngest in the Democratic field, appeared to question Biden\u2019s readiness.\n\n\u201cIn order to win, we need to put forward a candidate who can demonstrate the readiness to lead this country forward. We\u2019re going to have to turn the page. And it\u2019s not as simple as going back to normal. We\u2019ve really got to build up a new normal,\u201d Buttigieg told Fox News.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll also say when it comes to electability, every single time my party has won the presidency in the last 50 years, it\u2019s been with a candidate who\u2019s new on the national scene, hadn\u2019t spent a lot of time in Washington and represented a new generation of leadership. By contrast, every single time in the last 50 years we have put forward the most Washington-orientated candidate, we have come up short in November,\u201d he added.\n\nHours before Buttigieg arrived in Concord, a new poll from Politico and Morning Consult suggested that 37 percent of registered voters said they were either definitely or probably not ready for a president who is gay.\n\nButtigieg, who would become the country\u2019s first openly gay president if elected, said: \u201cI think the biggest thing on the minds of voters is whether they\u2019re getting paid enough, whether they\u2019re going to be able to get health care, how they\u2019re going to save for retirement.\u201d\n\nAnd he emphasized that \u201cserving up\u201d answers for such pocketbook concerns, \u201cI think is how we can get past a lot of old prejudices as America has time and time again proven itself capable of moving forward and not back on these issues.\u201d\n\nButtigieg has already gone up with TV ads in Iowa, which votes first in the presidential primary and caucus nominating calendar. When asked if he\u2019ll go up on the airwaves in the Granite State, Buttigieg pledged that \u201cyou\u2019ll be seeing a lot of us here in New Hampshire, both in terms of our commitments with investments, our large and growing ground game, and the use of my time. Because I think New Hampshire is the state that will really catapult me towards success in the nomination.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAsked where he needs to finish in New Hampshire, the candidate said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to set up the goalposts just yet.\u201d\n\nPointing to Warren and Sanders, who hail from the neighboring states of Massachusetts and Vermont respectively, Buttigieg noted that \u201cobviously there\u2019s some competitors with a neighborhood advantage, but I do think that we can do well here and when we do, that that\u2019ll be a key part of our path to the nomination.\u201d", "description": "South Bend, Ind.
