It proved to be a bombshell, with several damaging findings about the agency being revealed.\n\nOne of the people implicated in the report was Dlomo whom former president Jacob Zuma appointed as ambassador to Japan in 2017. He was recalled by President Cyril Ramaphosa in January this year.\n\nOf the SSA's special operations (SO) under Dlomo - who famously told colleagues he reported directly to Zuma - the panel said: \"It is clear from the above information and other information available to the panel that the SO had largely become a parallel intelligence structure serving a faction of the ruling party and, in particular, the personal political interests of the sitting president of the party and country. This is in direct breach of the Constitution, the white paper, the relevant legislation and plain good government intelligence functioning.\"\n\n\n\nThe report recommended that operations undertaken under Dlomo - including spying on unions and civil society organisations, the creation of a fake union in Marikana, influencing the media and conducting politically motivated projects - should be investigated by a multidisciplinary task team with an eye on criminal prosecutions.\n\nAsked about Dlomo's status at the SSA, acting director-general Loyiso Jafta said: \"He remains a member of the SSA.\"\n\nWhen pressed further about whether disciplinary steps have been taken against Dlomo, Jafta said he could not comment on matters relating to personnel in public.\n\nAnother of the high level panel report's recommendation was that the SSA should be divided into two agencies - one working internationally and the other locally.\n\nDlodlo said in this regard there would be two directors-general, adding this was the president's prerogative, in consultation with the Cabinet.\n\nShe was, however, not sure when this would happen.\n\n\"But I'm sure that it will be pretty soon because it also speaks of the unbundling of the SSA.\"\n\nDlodlo said the report would be implemented.\n\n\"It will be a staggered approach to the implementation of the high level panel report. There are immediate tasks that we'll need to look into, like for instance the climate and the culture of the organisation.\n\n\"There are short-, medium- and long-term things that we need to implement according to the recommendations. That depends on a few things, the budget. Look at the budget that we have compared with same-sized organisations across the globe with the same type of problems we have, you will see that we fare badly, so it will depend on the budget.\n\n\"But it will also depend on the type of skills we have in the organisation. That is also the reason that we are going through a skills audit, but also placing people in positions where their competencies are most required.\"\n\nShe said it would look at several mechanisms to help it implement the high panel review.\n\nDlodlo added she had \"no appetite\" for political interference.\n\n\"We will deal with issues that relate to our mandate in an impartial fashion. I don't think we can completely run away from the politics because that's what we are about, but the politicisation in an adverse fashion is what we will guard against.\"\n\nShe said that was why it would introduce a framework on ethics and integrity as well as appoint ethics officers in the organisation.", "description": "State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo's first priority is to work tirelessly to rebuild the image of the State Security Agency (SSA).
