The sword showed up in an X-ray scan, prompting the officers to open the box for closer inspection.\n\nThe man \"thought he could travel with it as a carry-on item because of its value,\" Farbstein explained. \"Of course, no weapons can travel in the cabin of a plane regardless of value. He ended up bringing it back to his airline counter to transport it as a checked bag/box so it would be placed in the belly of the plane where nobody would have access to it during the flight.\"\n\nGuy shows up at @EWRairport with this sword. Says he thought he could carry it on past the @TSA checkpoint because of its value. Doesn't matter to TSA how much the weapon is worth.

After determining the weapon was not live, the TSA turned it over to state fire officials for disposal, reminding the public that military weapons are not permitted in checked or carry-on luggage.\n\nDays later, an Air Force sergeant brought a rocket launcher tube through BWI. Although it contained no explosives, the Maryland State Fire Marshal's Office said it could possibly contain pressurized gas and therefore could not be transported on a commercial flight. The agency said it would hold onto the launcher tube it could be safely returned to the airman.\n\nTexas man checks missile launcher in luggage:He still caught his flight, TSA says\n\nTSA:Rocket launcher found in Baltimore airport checked luggage for second time\n\nContributing: Ryan Miller, USA TODAY; Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2019/10/09/tsa-finds-sword-carry-newark-liberty-international-airport/3916978002/", "description": "A Brazil-bound passenger tried to bring a sword through the TSA checkpoint in Newark.
