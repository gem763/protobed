News: 'Halsey has always been a huge fan of Evan's. A friend connected them and they had also been chatting over social media before deciding to hang out. 'It's still very new, but they are both interested in dating each other and hanging out'\n\nWhen they were seen at Six Flags, a bystander said: 'They were laughing and flirting the whole time while we waited for the ride, it looked really romantic. It looked like they were having a fun date night.\n\n'They were smiling and laughing together and looking into each other\u2019s eyes as they were waiting for the ride to start. When we got off the rollercoaster, we bought the photo of them on the ride and saw that they were holding hands, their fingers were intertwined.'\n\nHalsey hit Twitter to proclaim her affection for Evan in the past, before she is thought to have met him.\n\nIn 2012, she tweeted, 'Seriously Evan Peters stop making me attracted to alleged sociopaths and accused murderers\u2026' referring to his oft-psychotic characters on AHS.\n\nOver: Evan and fellow AHS star fianc\u00e9e Emma Roberts, 28, called time on their betrothal earlier this year\n\nIn 2013 she tweeted, 'Petition for Evan Peters to date me,' and in 2014 she tweeted: 'I\u2019m a f**king liar I\u2019m so in love with Evan Peters I\u2019m so whipped I\u2019m whipped as f**k!'\n\nHalsey broke up with singer Yungblud in September while Evan and fellow AHS star fianc\u00e9e Emma Roberts, 28, called time on their betrothal earlier this year.\n\nEmma has since moved on with Garrett Hedlund - who she had been quietly dating since March.\n\nEvan and Emma were on/off for seven years before finally ending it for good in the spring.\n\nTouching upon the split, she told Cosmopolitan back in May: 'I never want to talk about relationships I'm in or that are ending or have ended.\n\nNo show: After the split, it was announced that Evan would sit out the current ninth season of anthology series American Horror Story, for the first time since the show's inception in 2011 [in which he is pictured as Tate Langdon]\n\n'It's hard enough to be with someone by yourself, let alone with an audience.\n\n'Growing up is hard. Sometimes it makes me sad that I can't have a private moment. Because of Twitter and Instagram, there's a whole other element where everybody can comment on what you're doing and no one knows the real story.\n\n'That's hard\u2026 I think I know what's true, and I know what happened in my own life and so do the people who love me and who I love.'\n\nAwkward: Halsey has made no secret of her desire to get to know the hunk\n\nAfter the split, it was announced that Evan would sit out the current ninth season of anthology series American Horror Story, for the first time since the show's inception in 2011.\n\nEmma joined the series in its third season, Coven, and has appeared in seasons four, seven and eight since then.\n\nShe currently stars in the latest incarnation of the show (which resets its storyline with a different horror theme each year) as a seemingly-naive camp counselor.\n\nBoth Evan and fellow long-running star Sarah Paulson revealed they wouldn't appear in AHS: 1984, with many speculating that Evan's decision related to his and Emma's break-up.", "description": "Evan Peters and Halsey have sparked rumours that they are an item.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/00/20158680-0-image-a-39_1571958943016.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
