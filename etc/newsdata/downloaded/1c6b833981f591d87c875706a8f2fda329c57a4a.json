But like any impressionist work, when you examine it close-up, it\u2019s actually been a bit of a muddle, speckled with fast and furious brushstrokes.\n\nSportwatch: Swifts dominate Super Netball grand final, Eels v Broncos, and more \u2013 live! Read more\n\nSeason-ending injuries to key players, post-World Cup form slumps and the complexity of adding imports to an established team have all made a mess of the palette. But in the biggest game of the year, all the brushstrokes blended.\n\nAfter every expert tipped the Lightning to claim an historic three-peat, the Swifts flew out of the blocks at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre, scoring the first three with relative ease, making an empathic statement about the physicality the Lightning shooters could expect in the match: lots.\n\nLooking utterly fearsome, an up-and-about Sarah Klau got a tip on the first ball to enter the Lightning\u2019s attacking end and monstered anything that came within her wingspan. Lightning shooter Cara Koenen stood strong and was her side\u2019s only avenue to goal early, as Diamond Steph Wood got a bad case of the yips, missing her first two shots.\n\nWith nearly 13 minutes gone in the first and the Swifts well on top, Lightning coach Noeline Taurua pulled Wood to the bench, moved Koenen to goal attack and brought Peace Proscovia, who has been used only as impact player in recent times, to goal shooter.\n\nSam Wallace, who starred in the Swifts\u2019s preliminary final win over the Vixens, looked calm and relaxed at shooter, finishing the quarter with 11 from 12. Helen Housby took a tumble early but still managed five from six. The injection of Proscovia and two Karla Pretorius intercepts steadied Lightning and the quarter finished 16-12.\n\nIn the second, it went goal for goal for several minutes, with Koenen doing a mountain of work to compensate for an uncharacteristically quiet Laura Scherian. But through yet more defensive brilliance from Klau and Maddy Turner, the Swifts wrestled the ascendency back, even when Sophie Garbin replaced Housby halfway through the quarter.\n\nWith the score at 26-22 to the Swifts, Wood came back to GA, but didn\u2019t put up a shot in the four minutes she was on court. The Swifts circle defenders finished the half with a combined five intercepts, six deflections and three rebounds and their side in charge, 31-23.\n\nThe contest that will likely decide Super Netball grand final | Erin Delahunty Read more\n\nWith Housby back at goal attack, the Swifts scored the first two of the third, before Lightning made a concerted push which included Wood\u2019s first goal of the match, at the four-minute mark, followed by two more. But Klau wasn\u2019t having it, again injecting herself into the contest, with two intercepts, four deflections and two rebounds putting her side back in control. Wallace, being fed by a brilliant Paige Hadley, was continuing on her merry way in the other circle, shooting a perfect 12/12 for the quarter, bringing her game total to 32/34.\n\nAt the last break it was 46/36 \u2013 but the game was gone. The last was a mere formality, with the Swifts taking the game 64-47: the full masterpiece revealed.\n\nWallace, who shot 40 from 44 at 91% accuracy, was named the MVP. Many thought the honour would go to the other Swifts bookend, Klau, who finished with 11 gains and five intercepts.\n\nAfterwards, victorious coach Briony Akle claimed Klau played \u201cthe best game of her life\u201d in the final and tipped her and Turner as a potential Diamond defensive duo of the near future, arguing \u201cthey\u2019ve proven they can do it.\u201d\n\nAkle was also adamant the Swifts won\u2019t be content with just one Super Netball trophy. \u201cWe want to win this over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s about looking forward. Celebrating this now, but it starts all over again in November. Hopefully we can keep this team together and get a few more of these trophies.\u201d", "description": "NSW Swifts upset the odds to power past Sunshine Coast Lightning in the Super Netball grand final", "authors": ["Erin Delahunty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e195943a18331e7d14d0d5b06e36ceb96cacad52/0_193_3930_2360/master/3930.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=36b279cbd51439d3bc423711fbcf08e4", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
