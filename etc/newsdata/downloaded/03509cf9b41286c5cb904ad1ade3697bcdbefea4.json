A lot more.\n\nThe contentious immigration enforcement agency has expanded its work with Cellebrite, an Israeli data extraction company best known for offering to crack the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone at the behest of the FBI in 2016. Cellebrite reportedly broke into the device for the Bureau, though the FBI disputed that story. The company\u2019s technology can bypass most smartphones\u2019 locks and download data from all their apps for law enforcement.\n\nAccording to a recent federal filing, ICE will pay Cellebrite between $30 and $35 million for \u201cuniversal forensic extraction devices\u201d (UFED) and \u201caccessories licenses, training and support services.\u201d The contract, worth more than ten times the value of the $2.2 million agreement between the two agencies signed in 2017, will last between one and five years. The request originated from ICE\u2019s Dallas office, according to a notice of intent posted June 24th. The synopsis of the contract also states that Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and its Cyber Crimes Center (C3) plan to use Cellebrite\u2019s technology. Within ICE, HSI leads investigations into child trafficking, drug smuggling, and fraud.\n\nA single UFED retails for $5,000 to $15,000, according to Forbes, meaning ICE could be buying as many as 6,000 the devices from Cellebrite.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what use ICE will put Cellebrite\u2019s technology to and where it will do so. When The Daily Beast contacted ICE Contracting Officer Tracy Riley for details, Riley said she would \u201cabsolutely\u201d not provide more details about the contract. Cellebrite did not respond to a request for comment. ICE\u2019s office of public affairs responded to The Daily Beast but did not yet provide a comment.\n\nCBP officers searched the devices of more than 30,000 international travelers in 2017\u201410,000 more than the year prior, according to the most recently available data (ICE does not make such data available). In response to a lawsuit filed against the two agencies last year, CBP and ICE said their searches were \u201ca crucial tool for detecting evidence relating to terrorism and other national security matters\u201d and \u201ccan also reveal information about financial and commercial crimes.\u201d\n\nPrivacy advocates have decried warrantless searches of electronic devices at the border for allegedly violating constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizures.\n\nICE has become one of the Trump administration\u2019s most controversial agencies within the technology industry and without. Employees have called on Amazon, the data management firm Palantir, and the business software company Salesforce to end their work with the department, and protesters around the country have taken to the streets to speak against ICE\u2019s detention of migrants and their children in camps at the border.\n\n\u2014With additional reporting by Adam Rawnsley and Taylor Hatmaker", "description": "The agency's previous contract with Cellebrite was worth $2.2 million.", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568239600/GettyImages-945288792_1_g3rwfu", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
