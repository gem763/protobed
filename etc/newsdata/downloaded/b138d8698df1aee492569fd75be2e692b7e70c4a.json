The former Texas congressman later explained that he would use local law enforcement to ensure that all Americans hand over their \u201cassault weapons.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday that he agreed with Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, who said Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comment would be \u201cplayed for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg said Republicans and Democrats have a \u201cgolden moment\u201d to come together on gun control legislation and that Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comment will serve as a diversion.\n\n\u201cRight now we have an amazing moment on our hands,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have agreement among the American people for not just universal backgrounds checks, but we have a majority in favor of red-flag laws, [banning] high-capacity magazines, banning the new sale of assault weapons \u2014 this is a golden moment to finally do something, because we\u2019ve been arguing about this for as long as I\u2019ve been alive.\n\n\u201cWhen even this president and even [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell are at least pretending to be open to reforms, we know that we have a moment on our hands,\u201d he added. \u201cLet\u2019s make the most of it and get these things done.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke fired off a pair of tweets Sunday accusing Mr. Pete Buttigieg of perpetuating the same \u201ccalculation and fear\u201d that \u201cgot us here in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeaving millions of weapons of war on the streets because Trump and McConnell are \u2018at least pretending to be open to reforms?\u2019\u201d the former congressman tweeted. \u201cThat calculation and fear is what got us here in the first place. Let\u2019s have the courage to say what we believe and fight for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen candidates say, \u2018At least Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are pretending to be interested,\u2019 [expletive], that is not enough,\u201d he added. \u201cNeither is poll-testing your message. Gun violence is a life or death issue \u2014 and we have to represent the bold ideas of people all over the country.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
