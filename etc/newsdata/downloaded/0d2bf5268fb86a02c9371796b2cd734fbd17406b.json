In a chat with The Daily Beast, Plotz said the move was in keeping with the brand\u2019s decade-long focus on drawing from its community of users.\n\n\u201cWe hope that there will be someone in our community, someone who already understands us, who knows us, who will put themselves forward, or maybe they know somebody who seems like they have the perfect sensibility,\u201d he said, noting that the search will be aided by a firm to seek candidates and vet applications.\n\nPlotz\u2019s departure comes at a major transition point for the company. Launched in 2009 as a website dedicated to obscure and forgotten curiosities and oddities, over the past several years Atlas Obscura\u2019s business has transformed from more standard digital-media business, focused on advertising revenue and sponsored travel content, to a business focused increasingly on travel and experience offerings.\n\nLast month, the company announced that Airbnb led a $20-million funding round, making it the largest investment Atlas Obscura has raised in its history.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal noted that Airbnb would integrate Atlas Obscura into its website and apps, and would take a leading role in expanding the home-share tech giant\u2019s travel experience offerings. In turn, Atlas Obscura would increasingly look to expand its own travel offerings.\n\nIn a meeting last week, Atlas Obscura founder Joshua Foer acknowledged how much the business had shifted over the years that Plotz had been CEO.\n\n\u201cDavid has done an extraordinary job leading this company through three rounds of funding, and from a handful of employees to nearly 60,\u201d Foer told staff in a meeting last week. \u201cWhile other media companies are laying off, cutting back, and folding up, Atlas Obscura is growing and expanding, with a strategy that is working. And that is a testament to David's tremendous leadership and foresight.\u201d\n\nPlotz noted that part of the departure is logistical: He\u2019s spent the last five years commuting by train twice a week from his home in Washington, D.C., to the company\u2019s New York office\u2014an arrangement that has strained both parties.\n\nBut he also said the new investment from Airbnb marked a turning point for Atlas Obscura and his role as a leader.\n\n\u201cThe company is poised to have this huge growth in its trips and local experiences and that requires a set of skills that I don\u2019t have yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve done a good job stewarding it so far, and helping build this great brand that we built, but right now it needs someone who has these business skills that I would need to develop.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: This reporter briefly worked as an intern at Slate when Plotz was editor-in-chief there.", "description": "After an influx of cash from Airbnb, the user-centric website will seek a new top executive with help from its own readers.", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571076351/191014-tani-obscura-ceo-tease_whusel", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
