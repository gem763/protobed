The 28-year-old Brown lived in the same apartment complex as police officer Amber Guyger and Botham Jean when Guyger shot Jean to death in September 2018.\n\nBrown testified in Guyger's trial about the night that Jean was killed, saying he was in a hallway on the fourth floor, where he and Jean lived. He said he heard what sounded like \"two people meeting by surprise\" and then two gunshots.\n\nGuyger was convicted Tuesday and sentenced the next day to 10 years in prison.\n\nGuyger, 31, was still in her police uniform after a shift when, according to her testimony at trial, she said she mistook Jean's apartment for her own, which was one floor below. She said she pushed open Jean's unlocked door and shot the 26-year-old accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia after thinking he was a burglar.\n\nShe was fired from the department soon after the shooting.\n\nAmber Guyger, left, had said she mistook Jean's apartment for her own and thought he was a burglar. (Dallas County Sheriff's Department, Harding University/AP)\n\n'We need answers'\n\nA Dallas police spokesperson on Saturday would not confirm to The Associated Press that it was Brown who was shot Friday. He said the Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office would determine the identification Sunday.\n\nPolice said in a news release that they responded to the shooting shortly after 10:30 p.m. local time on Friday. They said several witnesses flagged officers down when they arrived and directed them to an apartment parking lot where the man who was shot was lying on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nThe man was taken to a hospital, where he died.\n\nWitnesses told police they heard several gunshots and saw a silver four-door sedan speeding out of the parking lot, according to the police news release.\n\nThe man was taken to a hospital where he died.\n\nLee Merritt, a lawyer for the Jean family, said in a tweet Saturday that he spoke with Brown's mother.\n\n\"She is devastated.
