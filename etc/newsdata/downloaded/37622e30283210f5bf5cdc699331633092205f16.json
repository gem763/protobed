It was Liverpool\u2019s first victory here since 1990 and they are unlikely to forget it in a hurry.\n\nSheffield United 0-1 Liverpool: Premier League \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nAlong the way J\u00fcrgen Klopp was forced to make changes to formation and personnel as his side struggled to preserve their 100% League record. \u201cHad it been a draw I would have said it was what both teams deserved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is unlucky for Sheffield United, for sure.\n\n\u201cWe were playing against a proper unit with the team, the manager and the crowd all making it feel as if you were playing against a wall. I was very impressed. The way they fight and play reminded me of my old team at Mainz. They do so many really good little things.\u201d\n\nIf Liverpool had expected Sheffield United\u2019s overlapping centre-halves to retreat into their shells, they were swiftly disabused as Jack O\u2019Connell, the left-sided element of the defensive trinity, pressed forward and Enda Stevens, the left wing-back, repeatedly accelerated into the space left behind Trent Alexander-Arnold. While Chris Wilder had clearly identified Liverpool\u2019s right-back as a weak defensive link, Stevens shone.\n\nAs a former centre-half, the watching Gareth Southgate probably enjoyed the no-quarter-given duel involving Oli McBurnie \u2013 whose bristling ginger beard seems somehow emblematic of his invariably feisty interpretation of the centre-forward role \u2013 and Virgil van Dijk. Although the much lauded centre-half held his own, he will certainly have had more comfortable afternoons.\n\nSouthgate had driven down from his North Yorkshire home to watch contenders for his England squad, perhaps including George Baldock, Sheffield United\u2019s right wing-back whose private duel with Andy Robertson would assume increasing importance. It did not take long to realise that, like Alexander-Arnold, Robertson could not exert his usual influence.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wijnaldum\u2019s shot squeezes through Henderson\u2019s legs.

Only Jo\u00ebl Matip\u2019s interception kept McBurnie at bay and Callum Robinson missed a couple of chances as Liverpool struggled for fluency.\n\nSo assiduous was the pressing and closing down that, at times, it looked as if Sheffield United contained two or three more players. With almost their every manoeuvre second guessed, Liverpool seemed in peril of suffocation and when Sadio Man\u00e9 did finally break free he was halted by the most courageous of challenges from John Egan. The Irish centre-half had a lot to do with the lack of visiting shots on target, not to mention the way Man\u00e9 and Mohamed Salah found themselves repeatedly, and unceremoniously, shunted down attacking cul-de-sacs.\n\nAdmittedly Man\u00e9\u2019s strike did rebound off a post as the ball bagatelled around the home area. It was characteristically cleared before Roberto Firmino could redirect the fall out beyond Henderson. Starved of time and space, Liverpool began snatching at the ball. Shots were sliced, passes overhit and crosses skewed as they struggled to cope with the success in subduing their full-backs.\n\nKlopp started pressing assorted tactical buttons, Alexander-Arnold and Robertson swapped flanks, Jordan Henderson was replaced by Divock Origi, the formation switched to 4-2-4 and the battle of the flanks heightened.\n\nYet amid the danger, McBurnie drew a good save from Adri\u00e1n while only Van Dijk\u2019s interception came between John Lundstram and a goal.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nNo one guessed calamity of the cruellest order beckoned for Henderson. For much of the afternoon Wijnaldum\u2019s performance had been regressively reminiscent of his once routinely ineffective away displays at Newcastle but then the Dutchman met a headed clearance on the edge of the area and volleyed straight at Henderson.\n\nThe keeper looked to have gathered routinely only for the ball slip from his fingers and through his legs before it slowly, agonisingly trickled across the line.\n\nHenderson stood alone, head in hands, and as if in sympathy, the sunshine briefly illuminating Bramall Lane was replaced by more of the rain that had earlier soaked the city.\n\nHenderson would soon save superbly from Salah but his manager clearly did not regard it as redemption. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a golden opportunity,\u201d said Wilder. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve let it slip through our hands.\u201d", "description": "Dean Henderson\u2019s goalkeeping error allowed Georginio Wijnaldum to score as Liverpool won 1-0 at Sheffield United", "authors": ["Louise Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab9d2fe90e73de549a36b30a56d67d962b996492/36_0_2238_1343/master/2238.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=06154f72281fe81880d9ab8c590a3ab6", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
