Generally, 52% of voters said asking a foreign leader for help in an election merits impeachment.\n\nMr. Trump has denied any wrong doing in the incident, arguing that Democrats are contorting the situation to justify their push for impeachment.\n\nThe poll was conducted over the weekend, from September 27 through September 29, with more than 1,000 registered voters surveyed. The poll had a margin of error of 3.6 percentage points.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
