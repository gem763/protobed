He is then hit in the face by another youth and falls to the ground against a pillar before being hit again by the first boy.\n\nDiego never regained consciousness and died on 25 September.\n\nHis family are \u201cdevastated\u201d, the Salcedos\u2019 attorney David Ring told a press conference. \u201cThey lost their 13-year-old son for no reason. It was totally preventable, and they\u2019re really having a difficult time coming to grasp that.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the assistant principal, she blew it off... she made a promise she didn\u2019t keep, and it cost this kid his life.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month two girls were arrested at another school in the same district after allegedly assaulting another student during lunch.\n\nA spokeswoman for Moreno Valley Unified said the district doesn\u2019t believe it is liable for Stolz\u2019s death but declined to comment on the case.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, there is no place for bullying in our schools and acts of violence will not be tolerated,\u201d Anahi Velasco added.\n\nThe two boys facing manslaughter charges are due to appear in juvenile court on Friday. They deny the allegations.\n\nAdditional reporting on Associated Press\n\nRead more\n\nSchool left child outside in cold after he said he was bullied", "description": "A 13-year-old schoolboy who died after being punched by two fellow students had complained to staff days earlier that he was being bullied, his family has claimed.Diego Stolz was knocked to the ground during the attack \u2013 which was filmed on a mobile phone - at Landmark Middle School in Moreno Valley,", "authors": ["Peter Stubley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T0FUB74YydT3eiZzt0L3Mw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/796e967ef676e453abe3b7056b8f7c7e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
