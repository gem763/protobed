However, his comments came during the Future Investment Initiative forum in Saudi Arabia, which has long opposed Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nWhile Putin visited both Riyadh and the neighboring United Arab Emirates this month, their differences still remain stark over Syria\u2019s war, though they may be slowly reconciling with Assad\u2019s continued rule. It wasn\u2019t clear whether Stone, who made the documentary \u201cThe Putin Interviews,\u201d realized that before beginning his remarks.\n\n\u201cMr. Putin was always concerned about the terrorists,\u201d Stone said. \u201cIf they had gotten to Damascus and they almost did, there would be a possible caliphate throughout this whole region.\u201d\n\nThe director added: \u201cI think Mr. Putin is very concerned about peace.\u201d\n\nRebel forces did reach Damascus\u2019 doorstep before Russia and Iran entered the war on Assad\u2019s side, but they included a range of fighters, not just Islamic extremists.\n\nMeanwhile, activists say Russian airstrikes have repeatedly targeted hospitals and civilian sites in Syria\u2019s war, something Moscow denies.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month pulled American troops from northern Syria, leading to a Turkish invasion in an area home to U.S.-allied Kurdish forces. Trump\u2019s administration now wants U.S. forces to guard Syria\u2019s oil fields. In the absence of U.S. troops, Russian military patrols have moved into the region between all the warring parties.\n\nIn a little less than 20 minutes on stage at the forum, Stone also acknowledged evacuating his home Sunday night due to California\u2019s wildfires, promoted the idea of nuclear power plants and called Lee Harvey Oswald, President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassin, an \u201cagent of the CIA.\u201d\n\nAsked if he\u2019d seen much of Saudi Arabia, Stone responded: \u201cYou\u2019ve kept me locked in a hotel room.\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear if he knew the nearby Ritz-Carlton Hotel served as a detention facility during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s 2017 purge targeting businessmen, princes and others.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "American filmmaker Oliver Stone on Wednesday praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \"stabilizing force\" in the Middle East, particularly in Syria as Moscow fills a void left by U.S. forces pulling out and leaving behind their Kurdish allies.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jon Gambrell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/people_oliver_stone_97878_c0-128-1975-1280_s1200x700.jpg?f94c98d6f9b0f579cf5d0ae8021ff0942b02387a", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
