In a text message, Howard told The Daily Beast that he, not AMI, is personally footing the bill for this expensive legal assistance.\n\nHoward is no shrinking violet when it comes to filing lawsuits to stop his colleagues in the media from disseminating news about him. In March 2018, as his involvement with Weinstein was receiving scandalous attention in the press, Howard, a former television reporter for Australia\u2019s Channel 7, successfully sued to prevent rival Channel Nine from airing video footage of him in the lobby of AMI\u2019s Manhattan headquarters, claiming it amounted to trespassing.\n\nThe Tweed law firm\u2014named for well-connected British media lawyer Paul Tweed, a social friend of former Jeffrey Epstein pal Prince Andrew\u2014has sent threatening letters on Howard\u2019s behalf to several U.K. booksellers as well as to Little, Brown Book Group Ltd., the British publishing arm of Hachette.\n\n\u201cWe have been consulted by Dylan Howard in relation to false and defamatory allegations, which he has been advised and has reason to believe will be included in the above-named book,\u201d the Tweed firm wrote in a Sept. 27 letter to Hive Store Limited, one of the targeted booksellers (which sources say also include Britain\u2019s W.H. Smith and Wordery chains).\n\n\u201cWe have put the publisher, Little, Brown Book Group Limited on notice that, if the offending content is included in the book, we are instructed to take such legal action as may be appropriate,\u201d the letter continued.\n\nThe letter concluded: \u201cYou are now on notice under UK and Irish defamation laws of the potential defamatory content within the said book. We would therefore urge you to satisfy yourselves that the offending references to our client have been removed prior to distribution by your company.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast asked Hive Store Limited and the other targeted booksellers for comment but did not immediately get a response.\n\nFarrow had no comment. Hachette declined to comment on the specific legal threats but said in a statement that \u201cthe explosive and important new reporting in Catch and Kill has been meticulously vetted and fact checked, and all individuals and organizations Farrow reports on have been given fair opportunities to comment. We are proud to be publishing this book.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released by AMI spokesman Hammond, Paul Tweed told The Daily Beast: \u201cI would confirm that a British publisher and online distributors have been put on notice in relation to defamatory allegations that our client has been given reason to believe will be published in a forthcoming book. Our client is therefore entitled to seek the protection of the libel laws applicable in the U.K. and Irish jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nTweed added: \u201cIt is for the publishers and the distributors to satisfy themselves as to the truth of what they publish and our client has made his position absolutely clear and will not be deterred from the facts by the leaking of correspondence to the media.\u201d\n\nDespite the participation of an American law firm in Howard\u2019s exertions to kill Farrow\u2019s book, he is unlikely to succeed in the U.S., where First Amendment protections are robust and judicial precedent frowns on prior restraint, prominent First Amendment litigator Floyd Abrams told The Daily Beast.\n\nBut in Britain, Ireland, and Australia, it\u2019s another story.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a great deal of impact here with prominent publishers, because our libel laws are generally quite protective of publishers,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cThis is primarily an English problem, of course. Their laws are much more libel-friendly than ours.\u201d\n\nAbrams cited the 2014 case of the Cambridge University Press, which refused to publish American Russia scholar Karen Dawisha\u2019s study of Vladimir Putin\u2019s mobster connections out of fear of litigation.\n\n\u201cAfter discussion with legal colleagues who have reviewed the typescript from both a US and UK legal perspective, I\u2019m afraid that our view is that we are not in a position to proceed with your book,\u201d the university publisher wrote the author. \u201cThe decision has nothing to do with the quality of your research or your scholarly credibility. It is simply a question of risk tolerance in light of our limited resources.\u201d\n\nThe letter to Dawisha continued: \u201cWe have no reason to doubt the veracity of what you say, but we believe the risk is high that those implicated in the premise of the book\u2014that Putin has a close circle of criminal oligarchs at his disposal and has spent his career cultivating this circle\u2014would be motivated to sue and could afford to do so.\u201d\n\nAbrams, who wrote about the Cambridge case in his recent book The Soul of the First Amendment, said that in the U.S., as opposed to the U.K., \u201cthe defendant has great power as a litigant to go and obtain the truth about the plaintiff by deposition and by documentary discovery and the like. A plaintiff has to be prepared to answer every question. It\u2019s not that that doesn\u2019t exist in Britain and Australia, but it\u2019s much less detailed.\u201d\n\nThe New York Post has reported that another prominent media figure featured in the book is former Today host Matt Lauer, who was accused by multiple women of sexual harassment. The Daily Beast has learned that Lauer has retained the services of Libby Locke from law firm Clare Locke\u2014which boasts about \u201ckilling stories\u201d on its website\u2014as the book nears publication.", "description": "Dylan Howard has hired a high-powered law-firm to quash the New Yorker writer\u2019s forthcoming book.", "authors": ["Lloyd Grove", "Editor At Large"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570053074/191002-grove-farrow-tease_q9qixe", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
