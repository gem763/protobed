Samples are also said to have been taken from areas where shells landed, including fragments of shells that exploded.\n\nThe shells have been tested in a mobile laboratory.\n\n\u201cExpress analysis of the samples has shown that the weapons contained chlorine and white phosphorus,\u201d said one unnamed Russian expert.\n\nReports say the samples are to be further analysed in Russia at a scientific facility licensed by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).\n\nThe Russian Defence Ministry claims militants repeatedly used chemical weapons in their attempts to break through Syrian army lines.\n\nThe opposition Syrian National Coalition, based in Istanbul, issued a statement denying the Russian allegations, saying that chemical weapons had only been used by the Assad regime and its allies.\n\nThe executive body of the global chemical weapons watchdog voted on Friday to condemn the use of banned toxic agents by the Syrian government and ISIL militants. It also authorises international inspections at sites in Syria.\n\nReuters quoted a source as saying that roughly two-thirds of the 41 members on the Executive Council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) endorsed the text.\n\nThe vote is described as unusual as the executive council of the body based in The Hague generally operates through consensus. But the text was reportedly supported by 28 members, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain. It was opposed by Russia, China, Sudan and Iran.\n\nThe British Foreign Office released a statement in which Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria, singling out \u201cthe Assad regime and Daesh\u201d (ISIL).\n\nSome reports say the vote represents a watered-down compromise on original plans by the Obama administration to impose penalties on Damascus and force President al-Assad\u2019s government to destroy chemical stockpiles \u2013 but still mark an important advance in attempts to hold offenders to account.\n\nAn international inquiry lasting over a year by the OPCW and United Nations concluded that Syrian government forces were responsible for the use of chlorine barrel bombs against civilians.\n\nThe Syrian army backed by Russian forces have been trying to oust rebels in an attempt to take control of Aleppo in what would be a major strategic victory in the five-year conflict. Their bombings of civilian areas have been condemned by western powers as war crimes. Moscow blames failure by the US to rein in extremists within the rebels\u2019 ranks for the ongoing fighting.\n\nIn a separate development, the Syrian government\u2019s military media released a video on Friday, which it said shows rebels firing upon each other before realising that they were on the same side.\n\nAccording to AP, the video could not be independently verified.\n\nAccording to the Syrian authorities it came from the helmet camera of a militant fighting with Fatah al-Sham \u2013 a group linked to al-Qaeda formerly known as the Nusra Front.\n\nThe fighter wearing the camera then falls to the ground after apparently being wounded \u2013 he is said to have died.", "description": "The Syrian opposition denies allegations by Moscow that its personnel found shells with toxic chemicals launched by rebels in the northern city.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford", "Unnamed Russian Scientist"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/349360/1000x563_349360.jpg", "published_at": "2016-11-11"}
