But, now we are in the midst of a presidential campaign election cycle and the last thing CNN wants to do is run a campaign ad that knocks its own reporters and on-air talent.\n\nCNN has refused to run two campaign ads submitted by the Trump re-election campaign but will air an ad that was submitted Thursday. The first one denied was \u201cBiden Corruption\u201d and it was released last week. The 30-second ad accuses Democrats of trying to steal the upcoming presidential election with the help of their \u201clapdogs\u201d at CNN \u2013 Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo, Jim Acosta, and it also includes MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow.\n\nCNN claims the ads aren\u2019t factual and that the mention of its employees is enough to justify denying the airing of the ads.\n\nAnother ad submitted to CNN and its corporate cousin Turner Sports on Thursday was rejected. CNN said the ad contains assertions about the whistleblower complaint against Trump that have been disputed by the intelligence inspector general, and uses the word \u201ccoup\u201d to describe the impeachment process set forth in the constitution. A third ad was accepted. While the ad says \u201cthe swamp\u201d hates Trump, flashing video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, it outlines actions taken in the president\u2019s first term and asserts that it takes a \u201ctough guy\u201d to change Washington.\n\nHere is the \u201ccoup\u201d ad:\n\nJust as CNN objects to the Trump campaign claim of corruption in Biden and his son\u2019s dealings in Ukraine, the cable news network also objects to the impeachment hearings as the Democrats attempt of a coup, as the campaign claims.\n\nCNN said in a statement that \u201cin addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.\u201d CNN cited similar concerns about false statements in declining the newer commercial, saying the spot makes claims about the whistleblower complaint against the president that the intelligence community inspector general has debunked. \u201cIn addition, it is inaccurate to use the word \u2018coup\u2019 to describe a constitutionally prescribed legal process,\u201d the company stated, echoing critics who slammed Trump\u2019s comparison of impeachment to an opposition group\u2019s violent, illegal overthrow of a government.\n\nThe third campaign ad is called \u201cChanging Times\u201d and has been approved for airing on CNN. The message is that \u201cMister Nice Guy\u201d won\u2019t cut it anymore.\n\nAs you can see, it\u2019s a fairly standard kind of campaign ad.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesman points to CNN using its platform to protect Joe Biden.\n\nHis campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, said \u201cCNN spends all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming, so it\u2019s not surprising that they\u2019re shielding him from truthful advertising too.\u201d\n\nIt is not unprecedented that a network deny airing a campaign ad. FOX did that, too, by the way, in 2017. FOX objected to a Trump ad that portrayed illegal immigrants as violent. The unusual part, as even the New York Times points out, is how early the denials are happening. It points to a very contentious campaign season.\n\nIt is unusual but not unprecedented for television networks to reject a political advertisement from a presidential candidate. On the eve of last year\u2019s midterm elections, major channels, including Fox News, removed a commercial from Mr. Trump\u2019s political team that portrayed immigrants as a violent threat. But political ads tend to be contentious in the latter stages of a campaign \u2014 not 13 months before Election Day. And CNN\u2019s decision could foreshadow a longer conflict between Mr. Trump\u2019s political aides and network executives who are tasked with reviewing the accuracy of the information that reaches viewers.\n\nCNN\u2019s bias is obvious to even the most casual viewer. FOX does have a bias toward Trump but the difference is that FOX also has on-air talent that isn\u2019t pro-Trump. A good example is Shep Smith, who is a classic anti-Trumper. There is no on-air talent on CNN or MSNBC that anyone would label as pro-Trump. There is no attempt to bring a little balance. Even most of the conservatives brought on as guests are Never-Trump conservatives.\n\nTeam Biden is trying to strong-arm FOX into not airing Trump\u2019s campaign ad that focuses on Ukraine.\n\nIn a letter to Fox News and Fox Business general counsel Lily Claffee, Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz wrote that the ad \u201cfalsely states\u201d that \u201cBiden offered Ukraine $1 billion to fire the prosecutor investigating a company affiliated with his son.\u201d \u201cThough the Trump campaign is prepared to fabricate outright lies, your station\u2019s airwaves should not be used to disseminate them,\u201d Schultz wrote. \u201cWe are putting you on notice about the absolute falsity of the advertisement\u2019s claims, and we expect that you will reject it. Please consider this letter a standing request that you reject any advertisement containing similar claims, regardless whether the Trump campaign or a third-party group seeks to place it.\u201d\n\nWe are putting you on notice. To which FOX responded, \u201cWe are not in the business of censoring ads from candidates on either side of the aisle.\u201d \u201cVice President Joe Biden has a standing invitation to appear on any of our platforms.\u201d\n\nGood old Joe doesn\u2019t appear on FNC, though, and was recently caught pointing his finger in campaign reporter Peter Doocy\u2019s face while demanding he \u201cAsk the right question.\u201d", "description": "The campaign ad is \"demonstrably false\" .", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CNN-logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
