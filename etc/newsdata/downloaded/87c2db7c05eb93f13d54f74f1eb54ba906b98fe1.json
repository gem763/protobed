She was taking notes. She asked us what we wanted.\u201d\n\nLater that night, she says, Rhone called her to extend an offer that would allow her mother to renew her lease for a year.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that she is going to get to stay where she is for another year,\u201d Cruey says. \u201cI\u2019m relieved. I just wish it hadn\u2019t gotten to this point.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nElsie Cruey, a former civil service worker and widow of an Army veteran, decided to share her story with me last week for a column that ran just a few days before she was expected to pack up and get out of her one-bedroom apartment. At that point, her family had tried to reach executives with Greystar but had not heard back from anyone.\n\nOn Sept. 16, Cruey received a \u201cNotice of Lease Termination\u201d that told her she needed to \u201cvacate\u201d the premises by Oct. 17. That notice cited an incident in which Cruey allegedly \u201crefused direct instruction to leave a private meeting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAfter being instructed to leave, you behaved in a loud and obnoxious manner, and you physically assaulted the community manager by grabbing her wrist,\u201d it read.\n\nCruey denied grabbing the manager and said she didn\u2019t know the meeting was private. It was run by a representative for Fairfax County and was about the Affordable Dwelling Unit rental program, which offers low- and moderate-income households a way to pay a reduced rent. A Fairfax County official confirmed in recent days that the meeting aimed to offer a general overview of the application and recertification process and that county staffers did not intend for it to be private.\n\nAD\n\nFairfax County is looking into five complaints that have been filed against the Overture, according to that official. The county\u2019s office of Human Rights and Equity Programs has received four complaints of discrimination, and Consumer Affairs has received one complaint.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI hope the Crueys\u2019 ordeal will result in overall policy improvements that will ensure older adults are treated with the respect and sensitivity they deserve,\u201d Sharon Bulova (D-At Large), chair of Fairfax County\u2019s Board of Supervisors, said in statement Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m glad they spoke out and am sorry they had to go through this.\u201d\n\nA Greystar official on Wednesday said that, because of privacy concerns, the company couldn\u2019t speak about a specific case but confirmed that a leadership team had met individually with most of the residents at the Overture in recent days.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOverture Fair Ridge takes matters like these very seriously and are pleased with the positive outcome with this particular issue,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are revisiting our processes to ensure all such matters are handled as sensitively as possible.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSandra Cruey says when she called her mom to tell her that she wouldn\u2019t have to move, her response was, \u201cYawhoo!\u201d She then started saying \u201cGod bless,\u201d followed by the names of different people who had helped her.\n\n\u201cI could hear and feel the happiness and smile in her voice,\u201d she says.\n\nThe family doesn\u2019t know what will happen after a year. They also hope the company will put in place changes that will ensure other residents don\u2019t have to fear getting hit with lease violations for seemingly small rule-breaking. One former resident described people receiving violations for cursing and taking an extra sausage at breakfast.\n\nAD\n\nElsie Cruey\u2019s cookie violation was documented in an email that was sent to her daughter. It described how she was \u201cstopped from taking a partial gallon of milk\u201d at breakfast and was later that day observed \u201ctaking a plate full of cookies\u201d at a mix-and-mingle.\n\nAD\n\nThe next day, according to the lease violation, \u201cthe resident and Community Manager had a conversation and the resident admitted to taking the cookies and having them with milk before bedtime.\u201d\n\nCruey denied that version of events. She said her friends baked those cookies and wanted her to try them. She insisted that she shared them with two friends the next day.\n\nWhen I first met Cruey, I asked her why she wanted to publicly share her story. She said she had formed friendships since moving into the complex in May 2018 and didn\u2019t want management \u201cdoing this to my friends one at a time when they come up for a new lease.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe recognized that the issue was bigger than her \u2014 even if she couldn't have realized just how much bigger.\n\nAD\n\nAfter that initial column ran, several people who claimed to have parents at the Overture wrote to me about their worries and shared stories that, if true, are concerning. People also wrote from across the country about their own senior housing woes.\n\n\u201cMy mother who is 88 was also asked to leave her \u2018forever home\u2019 in an assisted living facility for completely absurd reasons,\u201d wrote a person who noted that \u201cit\u2019s a big problem in Montgomery county too!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you have found here in this facility is NOT an isolated case,\u201d wrote a home health aide from New York. That person described a manager at a senior building putting baby monitors in residents\u2019 apartments to listen in on their conversations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere are horror stories in all senior HUD housing,\u201d wrote a person who described getting an eviction notice after a fire alarm in a hallway went off three times because a gap in her door allowed smoke from cooking to escape. \u201cThey bully tenants and instill fear in the elderly.\u201d\n\nOther people who had never met Cruey wanted to know whether they could contribute money toward her legal fees \u2014 which the family politely declined \u2014 and inquired about whether she needed temporary housing. She was offered a free hotel room in Fairfax and a place in an apartment housing complex in Kansas.\n\nAnd then there were the cookies. So many cookies. People wrote to find out Cruey\u2019s favorite type and to get the Overture\u2019s mailing address so they could satisfy every sweet tooth there.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWould you kindly tell this apartment complex I will supply cookies for every open resident community event please?\u201d one person wrote.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI would like to send the facility a few dozen cookies so they don\u2019t have to waste their time looking out for cookie monsters,\u201d someone in Southern California wrote.\n\n\u201cIf it will help your company stop picking on little old ladies for taking a few extra cookies home with them for a late night snack, contact me,\u201d a person in Philadelphia wrote. \u201cI would be happy to donate a monthly gathering of cookie platters to help offset any cookie losses Ms. Elsie may have caused. For the record, I would not have any issue at all if the facility manager helped themselves to any leftover cookies, to have as a late night snack.\u201d\n\nAfter one package of homemade cookies arrived for her mother, Sandra Cruey called the woman to thank her. She left a message with her mom\u2019s phone number. The two women later talked and discussed the husbands they had lost. They also spoke about the possibility of meeting each other one day.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is just truly heartwarming,\u201d Sandra Cruey says. \u201cI think about this lady baking cookies and I think about her packing them up and I think about her going to the post office to send them, and how much effort all that took. But she did it.\u201d\n\nShe and her sisters saw the negative side of her mother stepping forward. Strangers dug into her past and posted online about convictions that dated long before she moved into the Overture. A public records search shows that most were misdemeanors and related to using profane, threatening or indecent language over a public airway.\n\nBut the siblings also saw what Sandra Cruey describes as a \u201cdomino effect of goodness.\u201d They saw people speaking up about how the elderly should be treated in this country and people offering understanding because they, too, have parents who are in senior housing or might one day need to be. They saw strangers who, even if it was through a bit of flour and butter, felt compelled to right a wrong.\n\nCruey says that her mother doesn\u2019t need any more sweets. Her hope is that now, people will take the kindness behind that gesture and extend it to others.\n\nEven so, Elsie Cruey should probably keep her fridge stocked with milk for a little while longer.\n\nOn Tuesday night, shortly after the family heard from Greystar, my office phone rang. On the other end was a woman who said she didn\u2019t have an email account and needed Cruey\u2019s address.\n\nShe explained \u2014 although she didn\u2019t have to \u2014 that she wanted to bake her some cookies.", "description": "Elsie Cruey\u2019s situation at a Virginia apartment complex sparked concerns about senior housing across the nation.", "authors": ["Theresa Vargas", "Local Columnist Who Previously Wrote For The Local Enterprise Team About Poverty", "Race", "People With Disabilities."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xth8Oqy215e3QJ_g2aSS0nW0CSw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2KAKEAHPLQI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
