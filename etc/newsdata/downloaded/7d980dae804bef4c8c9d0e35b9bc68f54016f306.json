It wasn\u2019t a dream. It was his life.\n\nHis life.\n\nThough neither he nor Parks could have foreseen it, Flavio was about to become a pawn in a battle between two media titans: one in America, the other in Brazil. Both publications were trying to influence public opinion at a time when the ideological and geopolitical stakes felt frighteningly high.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nParks originally journeyed to Brazil for a Life magazine assignment on March 20, 1961, just as President Kennedy was proposing a foreign aid program aimed at improving cooperation between Latin America and the United States. Life\u2019s circulation at the time was around 7 million copies, the highest in the land, and its Republican-leaning editors weren\u2019t shy about using that influence.\n\nIt was the height of the Cold War. Fidel Castro\u2019s grip on Cuba had tightened after the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Latin America looked vulnerable to Communist takeover. Life decided to launch a five-part series titled \u201cCrisis in Latin America.\u201d Parks, the first African American to work as a staff photographer at the magazine, was assigned to part two.\n\nBrazil, like America, had a new president, J\u00e2nio Quadros. Quadros inherited an economy in crisis. He implemented an austerity program, of which the U.S. approved. But when the U.S. offered $300 million in foreign aid in return for cooperating with U.S. opposition to Castro\u2019s Cuba, Quadros rejected it. The offer, he felt, was an insult to Brazil\u2019s autonomy. It was tantamount to a bribe.\n\nLife editors liked to script photo assignments in advance. Parks was told to go to the Rio favelas, \u201cfind an impoverished father with a family of eight to ten children. Show how he earns a living \u2026 Explore his political leanings. Is he a Communist, or about to become one?\u201d They wanted Parks to round out the family shots with images providing some social context: ideally, a political rally in the favelas.\n\nParks had been uneasy about the assignment from the beginning. He had his own ideas. But an ally at Life urged him to accept, saying, \u201cRio de Janeiro is a long, long way from Rockefeller Plaza. Who knows, you might just misinterpret your instructions?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe first thing was to find a suitable family. Parks went to the favelas on a steaming hot day in March 1961. He was accompanied by Jos\u00e9 Gallo, who managed the local bureau of Time Inc., Life\u2019s owner. As they climbed up a \u201ctangled maze of shacks,\u201d Parks saw Flavio, who was carrying a 40-pound tin of water on his head, and who \u2014 he would soon discover \u2014 suffered from severe asthma.\n\n\u201cHe was horribly thin,\u201d wrote Parks, \u201cnaked but for his ragged pants. His legs looked like sticks covered with skin and screwed into two dirty feet. He stopped for breath, coughing, his chest heaving as the water slopped over his shoulder and distended belly.\u201d\n\nParks had his subject. He met Flavio\u2019s seven siblings in their home, high up on the Catacumba hillside, and, that evening, his parents. Flavio\u2019s mother, Nair, worked as a washerwoman. She was 35, and pregnant with their ninth child. His father, Jos\u00e9 Manuel, was 42. He had a kiosk selling kerosene and detergent.\n\nParks had traveled widely \u2014 including an earlier trip to Rio \u2014 but never had he seen such destitution. He and Gallo explained themselves and asked for permission to carry out their assignment. \u201cYou can photograph us,\u201d replied Jos\u00e9, eventually, \u201cbut you must show us in a good light.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cJust doing my job,\u201d we journalists tell ourselves. The lives we affect, and sometimes rearrange, are rarely changed intentionally. We maintain this stance even when it can feel suspiciously convenient, discharging us from the obligation to anticipate consequences.\n\nThen again, some consequences are hard to anticipate.\n\nParks finished his assignment, largely ignoring the instruction to focus on the father and his political leanings. Instead, he focused on Flavio, and on Flavio\u2019s brothers and sisters. He kept a diary of his days in the favela. He was there when the children woke up. He photographed them in their rudimentary kitchen. He even took them by car to Copacabana. The famous beach was just 15 minutes away, but they had never seen it, and Parks recorded their euphoric responses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEach night he left the favela and returned, uneasy, to his room in Copacabana\u2019s upscale Hotel Excelsior. Parks had grown up the youngest of 15 children, and the victim of racist bullying. Now a parent himself, he couldn\u2019t help but empathize with Flavio. He wrote of being \u201cfilled with confusion and guilt during my final days in Catacumba. Flavio, like thousands of other children, would die \u2026 I could not help compare the good fortune of my own children with the fate of these others.\u201d\n\nThree weeks after he arrived, Parks flew back to New York. \u201cI said goodbye to Flavio and the family today,\u201d he wrote. \u201c\u2018Gorduun, when do you come back?\u2019 he [Flavio] asked. \u2018Oh someday soon,\u2019 I lied.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t a lie.\n\nPark\u2019s photos appeared in the June 16, 1961 issue of Life under the heading, \u201cFreedom\u2019s Fearful Foe: Poverty.\u201d You can see them in the first room of \u201cGordon Parks: The Flavio Story,\u201d a riveting show at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The second, third, and fourth rooms uncover the bewildering events that the photo essay set in motion.\n\nAD\n\nParks belonged to a generation of photojournalists whose work could get massive exposure. He said that he wanted his work \u201cto draw people\u2019s attention to the problems they show,\u201d and to play a role in effecting change. An admirer of President Kennedy, he hoped that the new president\u2019s youth and progressive policies would have positive results. But he had seen firsthand, too, that the U.S. lacked credibility in Latin America. If it wanted to solve problems there, he realized, the U.S. needed first to \u201cclean up its own yard.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIntimate, observant, poetically suggestive, Parks\u2019s photos of Flavio and his family were the work of an artist. \u201cFar from condescending, they utterly personalized \u2026 and made intimate the tragedy of poverty,\u201d wrote Paul Roth, in the show\u2019s terrific catalogue (Roth\u2019s essay is the source for much of the information in this story). They \u201cpunctured,\u201d he said, Life magazine\u2019s \u201cconception of indigence as an abstract lure to an ideological foe\u201d \u2014 Communism.\n\nParks\u2019s photo essay was one of the most influential Life ever published. It provoked an enormous response from readers, who sent thousands of letters and unsolicited donations. When Life published excerpts from the letters in a subsequent issue, under the headline \u201cA Great Urge to Help Flavio,\u201d it included an appeal for more donations which it said it would use to move the Da Silvas to a modest new home and to seek medical treatment for Flavio.\n\nAD\n\nParks himself flew back to Rio on June 28 to deliver the message. To his relief, Flavio\u2019s parents needed no persuading to release Flavio to the care of a hospital in Denver. \u201cKeep him in hospital as long as necessary but please bring him back cured and well,\u201d said his father.\n\nAD\n\nAt Parks\u2019s hotel, Flavio had his first-ever bath (\u201cthe water was black,\u201d noted Parks) and donned new clothes that Parks had bought for him. A team of people worked on getting Flavio a visa and on finding a suitable home for his family.\n\nThe day came for the family to move out of Catacumba. Their story had spread, and a crowd gathered to watch. Parks, who was there to document the day, remembered a woman grabbing his shoulder and saying, \u201cWhat about us? All the rest of us stay here to die!\u201d\n\nThat same night, Parks and Gallo drove Flavio to the airport, and all three flew to the United States.\n\nAD\n\nIn Denver, Flavio was treated at the Children\u2019s Asthma Research Institute and Hospital. Life photographer Carl Iwasaki documented the first days of his life in Denver, including visits to the hospital, first days at school and a visit to an amusement park. The photographs of Flavio 2.0 \u2014 designed above all, it can seem, to make America feel good about itself \u2014 were published in the magazine\u2019s July 21 issue.\n\nAD\n\nThe repercussions of this intervention went beyond Flavio and his family. Editors at O Cruzeiro, an illustrated weekly in Brazil, took umbrage at Parks\u2019s photo essay (which had appeared in a Spanish-language of Life, distributed throughout South America).\n\nO Cruzeiro had Brazilian nationalist leanings. Its editors objected to a high-circulation American magazine with an explicit political agenda coming to Brazil to point out problems that had not been solved in its own country.\n\nAD\n\nTheir response was impudent, blunt, and charged with chutzpah. They sent their own photographer, Henri Ballot, to New York City. After photographing the streets of impoverished communities in Spanish Harlem and on the Lower East Side, Ballot homed in on Puerto Rican immigrants Felix and Esther Gonzalez. They lived with their six children in a dilapidated, rat- and cockroach-infested tenement building on Rivington Street.\n\nBallot\u2019s photographs were published in the Oct. 7, 1961 issue of O Cruzeiro. They revealed living conditions every bit as desperate as those of the Da Silvas. One photograph shows a child sleeping with three enormous cockroaches on his bare skin. Another shows a child with a bandage covering a rat bite on his forehead. O Cruzeiro rammed home its point by publishing some of Ballot\u2019s New York images with insets showing Park\u2019s original Rio images.\n\nThe two magazines went to war, each accusing the other of staging their photographs \u2014 of, effectively, manufacturing \u201cfake news.\u201d And, as happens routinely in any polarized media environment, real people enduring real predicaments were reduced to pawns in a propaganda war.\n\nMeanwhile, in Denver, the transition proved tricky for Flavio. He struggled at school. But things slowly settled down. He learned English, adapted his behavior and spent weekends with a Portuguese-speaking family, the Gon\u00e7alves. Over time, he had less and less contact with his family back in Rio. And when the treatment neared its conclusion after two full years, he was desperate to remain.\n\nHe begged Parks and the Gon\u00e7alves to adopt him. Instead, in July 1963, Flavio returned to Rio, where he stayed briefly with his family before being sent to a boarding school in S\u00e3o Paulo. The school was arranged and paid for by Life.\n\nParks maintained contact with Flavio after the boy\u2019s return to Brazil, and in 1978 he published a book (\u201cFlavio\u201d) about the experience, which brought him back to Rio to gather material. Parks also visited in 1999 to film a documentary (\u201cGordon Parks \u2014 Half Past Autumn\u201d). In each of those trips, the journalist saw that his subject\u2019s struggles with poverty had never really abated.\n\n\u201cAs a photojournalist,\u201d Parks wrote, with more than a tinge of melancholy, \u201cI have occasionally done stories that have seriously altered human lives. In hindsight, I often wonder if it might not have been wiser to have left those lives untouched, to have let them grind out their time as fate intended.\u201d\n\nFlavio himself, now retired from his job as a security guard, later reflected on the fact that, thanks to Parks, \u201cpeople know more about my life than I do. I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m alive as a result \u2026 [But] this story never made me feel either better or worse than anyone else.\u201d", "description": "Photographs of an asthmatic boy in a Brazilian favela prompted an outpouring of generosity.", "authors": ["Sebastian Smee", "Art Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JStPG4MnOJ-kQzRv35O2JPaxeBw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DXNJ4FXLQYI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
