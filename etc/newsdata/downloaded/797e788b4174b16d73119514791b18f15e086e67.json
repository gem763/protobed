They were older, they had money, they looked after me.\n\n\u2018Everyone I met was a criminal, so I normalised criminality. It was good to do robberies and get away with it.\n\nHe has now dedicated his life to helping young people who find themselves in the same situation he was once in (Picture: More Than My Past)\n\n\u2018It was only bad if you got caught, so you learned not to get caught.\u2019\n\nAfter spending six years in a young offenders institution for robbery, Terry\u2019s crimes escalated and he spent years trafficking drugs across Europe and partying 24/7.\n\nWith a crime squad hot on his heels, he was forced to briefly stop, but soon enough he\u2019d come up with a plan to steal more money than ever.\n\n\u2018Ocean\u2019s Eleven\u2019 heists saw him and four others disguise themselves as policemen and head to bonded warehouses to trick guards.\n\nSpeaking about one heist in Kings Cross, Terry said: \u2018We just walked through the front door wearing police uniforms with some ID and we took our own \u2018police\u2019 dogs.\n\n\u2018We said we\u2019d been informed there was a robbery and someone was getting in through the roof.\n\n\u2018They let us in and we told them we\u2019d like to cuff everyone until we found out who it was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018After we cuffed them, we nicked about \u00a34 million pounds worth of motherboards computer chips.\u2019\n\nBut after years of making millions, the robber\u2019s lies finally crashed down on him.\n\nIn 2008, he was walking down a \u2018quiet road\u2019 that \u2018came alive\u2019 with police who arrested him.\n\nHis house was raided and he was forced to confess his crimes to his teenage children, who had believed their dad had a \u2018normal\u2019 job.\n\nThe 54-year-old has now founded a platform for the people of Camden to tackle violence (Picture: Terry Ellis)\n\nHe said: \u2018It was a pretty traumatic time for the girls. They just saw me as their dad who provided and went out to work every day, never had a clue what I was doing.\n\n\u2018My biggest regret is not being there for them and not being the father they thought I was. That comes back to haunt me quite a bit.\u2019\n\nTerry was sentenced to 16 years in prison, but despite his burgeoning regret, he still tried to escape and took on eight officers in a brutal fight.\n\nHe said: \u2018In my head there were two voices, one wanting to get away and one saying \u2018stop it, you\u2019re caught now\u2019.\n\n\u2018There was this bad part of me that was really reckless and didn\u2019t give a monkey\u2019s.\u2019\n\nThe dad finally found peace when he was sent to HMP Grendon in Buckinghamshire, the only prison in the UK run entirely as a democratic therapeutic community.\n\nAfter spending two years in therapy alongside child murderers, sex offenders and serial killers, he finally dealt with his issues.\n\nTerry\u2019s campaigns against knife crime have led him to meet politicians like Jeremy Corbyn (Picture: Terry Ellis)\n\nHe said: \u2018That was the moment I realised I\u2019d normalised going to prison, normalised going into care, normalised my life, but I was actually quite a messed up individual.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018As I talked, I felt a little bit of relief, understanding.\u2019\n\n\u2018After therapy, I didn\u2019t need to take drugs anymore. I\u2019m now 14 years without drink, drugs, cigarettes and still counting every day as a blessing.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s really just from understanding who I was. I think you have to become a victim before you can deal with your troubles. I found me for the first time.\u2019\n\nAfter spending 15 years of his life in custody overall, Terry left prison and was helped back on his feet by loved ones.\n\nUK ticket-holder scoops huge \u00a3170,000,000 EuroMillions jackpot\n\nHe has since set up his own social enterprise to help ex-offenders to find jobs, founded a platform for the people of Camden to tackle violence and runs the Camden branch of charity A Band of Brothers that provides mentors for young men in the criminal justice system.\n\nThe former armed robber also supports More Than My Past, a campaign that aims to challenge the stigma ex-offenders and recovering addicts \u2013 who are the two groups that organisations are least likely to employ \u2013 find themselves up against.\n\nTerry says he\u2019s never once missed his life of crime and advises young people in his situation to pick their role models wisely.\n\nHe said: \u2018Don\u2019t pick someone who\u2019s a villain, who\u2019s doing the easy money.\n\n\u2018Pick someone like your dad who\u2019s working, pick someone like the school teacher, the fireman, the policeman and try to educate yourself out of the mess.\u2019\n\n\u2018Remember, if you sleep with dogs, you\u2019re going to get fleas.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
