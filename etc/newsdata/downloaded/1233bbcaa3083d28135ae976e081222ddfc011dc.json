Guaid\u00f3 was recently elected president of the country's National Assembly, and he says the Venezuelan Constitution grants him authority to lead the country because Maduro was re-elected last year through fraud.\n\nThe U.S. has recognized Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela's interim leader and imposed sanctions to weaken Maduro. Trump spoke to the opposition leader Wednesday congratulating him \"on his historic assumption of the presidency\" and stressing \"the importance of the large protests across Venezuela against former dictator Maduro,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 thanked Trump on Twitter for the phone call.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 had urged Venezuelans to list their grievances on placards and stage a two-hour demonstration Wednesday beginning at noon local time. He found a receptive audience in Venezuelans who have suffered under Maduro's policies. Hyperinflation and a plummeting economy have caused widespread hunger and a shortage in medical supplies.\n\nAt one hospital, a protester held a sign that said \"Our children die as they wait for surgery.\"\n\nMedical students said a lack of supplies and medicines such as insulin are killing their patients.\n\nEconomist Ricardo Hausmann told NPR's The Indicator that a Venezuelan earning a median salary would be able to buy fewer than two eggs on a day's wage. A survey from three universities in Venezuela found that citizens lost 24 pounds on average in 2017 because of the food shortage. Maduro's government has struggled to address the hardship and once drew ridicule for suggesting people eat rabbits to survive.\n\nProtesters on Wednesday used the word for \"usurper\" to describe Maduro. In the Caracas neighborhood of Chacao, protesters stood on a road and waved Venezuelan flags. One held a placard that said \"Stop the Maduro Genocide.\"\n\nMaduro has shown no signs of relenting to the opposition. He retaliated by freezing Guad\u00f3's bank accounts and barring him from traveling overseas. Venezuela's chief prosecutor, Tarek William Saab, announced a criminal probe Tuesday into Guaid\u00f3's anti-government activities. In a video posted to Facebook and subtitled in English, Maduro accused President Trump of orchestrating a coup against his regime in an attempt to steal Venezuela's oil resources, and he warned the U.S. against military intervention.\n\n\"Let us not allow another war like Vietnam in Latin America,\" Maduro declared. \"Venezuela has a strong democracy. We have our own problems, as any other country, and we will solve them by ourselves.\"\n\nMaduro also joined dozens of evangelical supporters in a prayer session that was aired on state TV, appealing to an \"all powerful God\" to bless the nation, the AP reported.\n\nThe U.S., in turn, has ratcheted up pressure on Maduro's government. On Monday, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela's state-run oil company, and a day later, the State Department said it had granted Guaid\u00f3 authority to take control of Venezuelan government assets held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or any other U.S.-insured banks.\n\nThe U.S. is Venezuela's biggest customer for oil, and production is expected to drop if Maduro remains in power.\n\nWorld powers have lined up on either side of the Venezuelan crisis. Some two dozen countries, including several Latin American nations, Australia, Canada and Israel, have backed Guaid\u00f3. A number of Western European countries have said they will side with him if Maduro does not call new elections.\n\nRussia and China continue to support Maduro's regime with loans and political support at the U.N. Security Council. Private military contractors linked to Russia's government are also rumored to be in Venezuela protecting Maduro, Reuters reported, citing sources close to the contractors.\n\nOn Wednesday, Guaid\u00f3 called on Venezuelan armed forces to \"cross over to our side, the side of the constitution.\"\n\nSo far, the vast majority of Venezuela's military has remained loyal to the sitting president and ignored Guaid\u00f3's appeals. On Wednesday, Maduro presided over military exercises and rallied rows of troops in green fatigues, invoking the liberator Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and referring to the U.S. support of Guaid\u00f3 as imperialism.\n\n\"The sun is rising,\" Maduro said. \"January is gone. And rebellious February, anti-imperialist February, is coming.\"\n\nMaduro has offered to talk with the opposition, but Guaid\u00f3 is likely to refuse negotiations because he does not recognize Maduro as the leader of the country.\n\nLast week, Guaid\u00f3 successfully summoned hundreds of thousands of people for protests, as NPR has reported. The U.N. said Tuesday that 40 people are believed to have been killed during the weeklong political standoff. More than half of them are believed to have been shot by security forces or pro-government forces while protesting, and one member of the National Guard is also believed to have been killed during protests. More than 850 people are thought to have been detained.\n\nTwo French reporters covering the protests for the TV program Quotidien have been arrested, Reuters reports, citing a French diplomatic source.\n\n\n\nGuaid\u00f3 has called for more protests on Saturday.\n\nVenezuela expert Bruce Bagley at the University of Miami said social protests and foreign pressure were unlikely to push Maduro out of office unless the military switched allegiances.\n\n\"Maduro doesn't care how many countries condemn him,\" Bagley told NPR.\"The fulcrum is the military.\"\n\nThe U.S. intervention is welcome among Venezuelans who are fed up with Maduro, NPR has reported, but worries remain that any transition would be violent, as hard-line pro-government troops, police and militias hold fast.\n\nLatin America Venezuelan President Maduro Faces Intensified Pressure To Step Down Venezuelan President Maduro Faces Intensified Pressure To Step Down Listen \u00b7 5:07 5:07\n\nSo far, Washington has leveraged only political and financial pressure on Maduro. However, in a Monday briefing, national security adviser John Bolton held a yellow notepad containing a scrawled note that read in part \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"\n\nThe White House has repeatedly said that \"all options are on the table\" regarding Venezuela.\n\nThe State Department has warned U.S. citizens not to travel to Venezuela because of crime, civil unrest and the risk of detention. All nonemergency U.S. personnel have been ordered to leave.\n\nNPR's Isabel Lara contributed to this report.", "description": "Opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 called for nationwide rallies a week after he declared himself interim president and demanded Nicol\u00e1s Maduro step down or call new elections.", "authors": ["Daniella Cheslow"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/30/gettyimages-1090937552_wide-fa3f2617b155c293f8d4023c09833579b58d3237.jpg?s=1400"}
