The shooter murdered 12 people and injured 70 more.\n\nEven though early rumors that the gunman identified himself as the Joker turned out to be \u201ccompletely unfounded,\u201d the concern that screening a film featuring the character might invite more violence kept it off the screen there.\n\nAP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File In this July 27, 2012, file photo, crosses honor of the victims of the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting. The gunman was convicted of murder and attempted murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.\n\nThe theater did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment, but a box office employee confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that the film won\u2019t be playing at the remodeled venue.\n\nSeparately, a group of family members and friends of the victims sent an open letter to Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff on Monday, asking the entertainment company to use this moment to speak out in support of gun control measures.\n\n\u201cWhen we learned that Warner Bros. was releasing a movie called \u2018Joker\u2019 that presents the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story, it gave us pause,\u201d the letter reads.\n\n\u201cWe want to be clear that we support your right to free speech and free expression. But as anyone who has ever seen a comic book movie can tell you: with great power comes great responsibility. That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on you to use your massive platform and influence to join us in our fight to build safer communities with fewer guns.\u201d\n\nRick Wilking / Reuters Relatives of victims of gun violence listen at an event marking the one-year anniversary of the Aurora theater shootings.\n\nThe family members specifically urged Warner Bros. to cease offering financial support to political candidates who receive contributions from the National Rifle Association. It also called on the company to actively lobby for gun reform in Congress and contribute to funds for survivors of gun violence and gun violence intervention programs.\n\nIn an emailed statement to HuffPost, Warner Bros. defended its record on gun violence, citing donations to victims of violence and saying the company supports bipartisan legislation to address the gun violence \u201cepidemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the same time, Warner Bros. believes that one of the functions of storytelling is to provoke difficult conversations around complex issues,\u201d the statement added. \u201cMake no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with comment from Warner Bros.", "description": "Some family members of the victims are also calling on Warner Bros. to support gun control measures.", "authors": ["National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8a4ace24000032007ca92f.jpeg?cache=vlr112i6qi&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
