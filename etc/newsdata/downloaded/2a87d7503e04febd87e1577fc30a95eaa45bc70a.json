(Fathom Events will preview the film Wednesday in select theaters.)\n\nAll three works look inward, into the alchemy of how a kid from Freehold, New Jersey, became a rock superstar, best-selling author and now a star of a movie.\n\nAnd Springsteen believes they are among his best works.\n\n\u201cI think probably coming up on 70 had something to do with it and just being at a certain point in your life and your work life where you felt prepared to sort of summarize the trip you\u2019ve been on for quite a while. It all happened as an accident,\u201d says Springsteen of the trilogy. \u201cObviously the timing was right and it was the kind of work I was ready and anxious to do. But all those three things, I\u2019m very proud of all those three things. I think they\u2019re three of the best things I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\n\"Western Stars\" is a performance film of Springsteen with a band and orchestra playing songs from his latest album, \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d with filmed spoken interludes by Springsteen.\n\nBruce Springsteen sits down for an interview to promote his new documentary, Western Stars, in New York City, NY Friday, September 27, 2019.

His family left New Jersey for California when he was in his early 20s.\n\n\u201cMy dad (Douglas Springsteen) knew absolutely nothing about California or the West except that was where he wanted to go to begin his new life. And he took my mother and my sister with him and that\u2019s where they went, and that\u2019s what they did,\u201d Springsteen tells the USA TODAY Network New Jersey. \u201cThey spent $3,000, that was all the money they had. They spent two nights in the car and a night in a motel on the way out there. They just built everything from scratch when they got there.\u201d\n\nDig deeper: Want more Bruce Springsteen and Western Stars?

Pictures\n\nSpringsteen, who was living at the Jersey Shore, soon made his way out, too.\n\n\u201cThe first time I visited them they were in a tiny little apartment in San Mateo and I was 20 or 21,\u201d Springsteen says . \u201cThe idea that continues to hold true for a large portion of the country when people think of creating something new, or becoming something new, \u2014 that lure of a place to restart your life, retrace your steps, erase your sins \u2014 continues to be westward.\u201d\n\nSurprise!: Bruce Springsteen introduces 'Western Stars' to his New Jersey hometown fans\n\nSpringsteen himself was looking for a restart. Friend Carl \u201cTinker\u201d West drove him out.\n\n\u201cI went with no plans on coming back,\u201d says Springsteen, speaking on a recent morning in the basement lounge of a New York City hotel. \u201cI thought I was going to go and begin a new career somewhere outside of San Francisco and I thought I would be able to do that with some difficulty, perhaps, but I thought I\u2019d be able to do it. But at the end of the day I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHow the West won the album and film\n\nCalifornia is the land of dreams and also broken promises. So it is in \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d where the album vividly brims with scenic deserts, dusty highways and the last chance stands of wayfarers, cowboys, renegades and solitary figures on the fringes of show business.\n\nThe album\u2019s aura is exquisitely brought to life in the film.\n\n\u201cThose were just characters I was interested in and I felt I could write about them in a certain moment,\u201d Springsteen says . \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in writing these Western stories for quite a while. If you go back to \u2018Tom Joad\u2019 (1995\u2019s \u2018The Ghost of Tom Joad\u2019), you have all the border songs that I wrote at the time.\n\n\"If you go to \u2018Devils and Dust,\u2019 \u2018Silver Palomino,\u2019 \u2018Black Cowboys\u2019 and \u2018Matamoros Banks,\u2019 so I\u2019ve been writing in the geography for quite a while and this particular record allowed me to sort of draw on what are to me Western musical influences along with Western stories,\" he says . \"So I said, \u2018What\u2019s the modern West?\u2019 It\u2019s Hollywood, it\u2019s Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI went searching there for a few interesting characters to write about.\u201d\n\nSpringsteen on mental health, dark days\n\nA closer look, however, reveals that the film is one of Springsteen\u2019s most personal works, revealing an inner turmoil that has shadowed him throughout adulthood.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, if I loved you or if I felt a deep attachment to you, I would hurt you if I could,\u201d says Springsteen in a vignette setting up \u201cTucson Train\u201d in \u201cWestern Stars.\u201d\n\nIn the film, Springsteen thanks his wife, Patti Scialfa, and his loved ones and friends for pulling him through the darkness. He\u2019s had bouts of depression and has been in therapy for more than 30 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a thing where I just started talking about it because it was such a large part of my life and at some point something you\u2019ve been doing for 30 years and it\u2019s had such a deep influence on you,\u201d Springsteen says . \u201cIt\u2019s something that comes up in conversation at some point.\u201d\n\nHis dad's struggles with mental illness are depicted in \"Born to Run\" and \"Springsteen on Broadway.\"\n\n\u201cEverybody has to find their own way but if I had grown up in a house, say, where (treatment) had been part of our resources, it would have been a very different life,\u201d Springsteen says.\n\n\u201cBut, who knows? You don\u2019t know at the end of the day where the fuel for the fire comes from. I don\u2019t have any regrets, but it would have been a lot easier on my parents and on my father if he had recourse to some help.\u201d\n\nSpringsteen\u2019s speaking up about his plight may help others seek help, says Frank Ghinassi, president and CEO for Rutgers Health University Behavioral Health Care.\n\n\u201cWhen someone who is a position like that says in the face of troubles that they sought care, I think that can give hope to others to seek that care as well,\u201d Ghinassi says.\n\nLove letter to Patti Scialfa, nods to John Wayne\n\nThe film is, in part, a love letter to Scialfa. Springsteen tenderly recounts romantic getaways to a park bench in front of the Empire Diner in New York City early in their relationship.\n\nThe couple have three children: Evan, 28; Jessica, 27; and Sam, 25.\n\n\u201cPatti was an enormous, enormous part of bringing all of that into my life, that I had resisted and failed to be able to do earlier,\u201d Springsteen says. \u201cYou know, she\u2019s a very strong and supportive and powerful woman, very loving. I got into a place where I was, I kind of dug myself into a black hole. It took quite a while to dig myself out of it and it took a lot of help from a lot of different places. So I\u2019m very grateful for it and a part of what the film is is a thank you to my lovely wife.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s a nod or two to John Wayne in the film. Hey, it\u2019s a western, after all.\n\n\u201cIf you grew up as a child in the '50s, of course, he was just a huge western star, he was the western star and the civilized western man all through the \u201950s and \u201960s,\u201d Springsteen says.\n\n\u201cThe films he made are eternal. They\u2019re just beautiful and forever, and his performances in them are things of wonder as far as I\u2019m concerned. I\u2019ve always been a big fan, you know. I always found a sweetness and a tenderness in them, particularly in \u2018She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWestern Stars' Jersey roots\n\nThe musical performances in \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d released by Warner Bros., were filmed over two days in May inside a barn on Springsteen\u2019s property in Colts Neck, New Jersey.\n\nBRUCE SPRINGSTEEN in WESTERN STARS, a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Photo by Rob DeMartin (Photo: ~Rob DeMartin)\n\n\u201c(As I wasn\u2019t) going to tour (for \u2018Western Stars\u2019), maybe I\u2019ll just do a film of me doing a performance of the music with a big orchestra somewhere \u2014 in a theater or around home somewhere,\u201d Springsteen says. \u201cWe ended up doing it in the barn and once it was finished, we said OK, we\u2019ll do the normal sort of interviews: \u2018What was it like to play on the sessions?,\u2019 \u2018What a nice guy I am,\u2019 \u2018How great it was to work with me,' all the usual stuff (laughs).\n\n\"But before that actually happened, I started to look at some of the performances, and it\u2019s all new music. How am I going to draw people into what I\u2019m doing? Well, I think I need some sort of exposition that occurs before each song. So I sat at home one night and spent about two hours and wrote the whole script for all the spoken parts for the rest of the film.\u201d\n\nA Labor of love\n\nSpringsteen earned his co-director title, says \"Western Stars\" co-director Thom Zimny, a Point Pleasant, New Jersey, native.\n\nCLOSE Bruce Springsteen talks his love of Western movies during a recent interview with the USA Today Network about his new film \"Western Stars.\" Tanya Breen, @tanyabreenphoto\n\n\u201cBruce was there with me in the cutting room, he was there discussing things on set with me. He was bringing references. We collaborated together 100 percent on this, and he was there when I was color correcting and when I was mixing,\u201d says Zimny, a long-time Springsteen collaborator who recently won an Emmy for his directing of the Netflix version of \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway.\u201d \u201cBruce was deep in the cave of the editing room, working away. I actually cut it right at a studio next to him, in an edit room set up in his kitchen area that was directly up next to his studio.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was all there waiting to come out. It was in the record, it just hadn\u2019t been verbalized,\u201d Springsteen says. \u201cThen we started to use them as just voiceovers, and then we needed images to accompany the voiceovers. So Thom (Zimny) had some found images. We had a little bit that we shot in Joshua Tree National Park with Danny Clinch. Those fit really well.\n\nBRUCE SPRINGSTEEN in WESTERN STARS, a Warner Bros.

Then I scored all of that and suddenly we had something that turned into an actual movie, turned into an actual film.\u201d\n\nAn actual film that Springsteen considers one of his brightest stars. Western or not.\n\nBruce Springsteen's new song 'Hello Sunshine' is a gorgeous return\n\nThis Springsteen superfan has been to 150 shows.
