Hundreds of people across the U.S. have been sickened, mainly by vaping cannabis oil, and six deaths have been reported. Public health officials aren\u2019t sure what\u2019s causing the lung issues, vomiting and other symptoms, but in California they say most patients reported purchasing vapes from pop-up shops or other illegal sellers that are a pipeline for counterfeit products.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nThe problem has gotten so pervasive that a major legal brand, Kingpen, is investing millions of dollars to redesign its packaging and product security, The Associated Press has learned.\n\nThe distributor for another major brand, Heavy Hitters, devotes a section of its website to report phonies and has hired a former federal prosecutor, Priya Sopori, to help the company deal with counterfeiting.\n\n\u201cThe danger presented by counterfeit products is just a natural result of not having the money, the resources or the people power to enforce licensing,\u201d Sopori said. \u201cSomeone is buying this packaging, buying these cartridges and filling them with whatever. It\u2019s being sold as our brand.\u201d\n\nVapes: A Healthier Option?\n\nAs marijuana has gone mainstream, versions of e-cigarettes that vaporize high-inducing cannabis oil are one of the hottest-selling items, popular for those who don\u2019t want the smoke that comes from lighting up a joint. In addition to quickly delivering a high, there\u2019s a perception not supported by science that vaping is a healthier alternative to smoking.\n\nIn California\u2019s legal market, the world\u2019s largest, the state requires cannabis oil to be tested before being placed on the shelf for sale. For example, safety checks are made for the presence of 66 pesticides, mercury, lead and other heavy metals, and 21 solvents that could be used in the extraction process, when oil is pulled from cannabis.\n\nBut it can be hard for consumers to tell whether a product they\u2019re buying is made by a legitimate company. The phony packaging is convincing to the untrained eye, some even carrying bogus labels that appear to carry state-required test results. Most consumers probably wouldn\u2019t know the difference \u2014 until they vape it. The taste and THC level could be significantly different from the authentic product.\n\nTo add to the confusion, consumers can have trouble distinguishing legal dispensaries from unlicensed shops, which in Los Angeles sometimes operate in the same neighborhoods and appear indistinguishable.\n\n\u201cMy biggest fear of counterfeiting is people are getting an unsafe product, and illegal product, and think it\u2019s coming from our company, a legal company,\u201d says Bryce Berryessa, a board member of the California Cannabis Manufacturers Association whose company, Skunk Feather, produces concentrates and vape cartridges.\n\nIn another warning of consumer risk related to vaping, an Associated Press investigation Monday found that some operators are substituting illegal synthetic marijuana in vapes marketed as natural CBD, a chemical in cannabis that doesn\u2019t cause a high and promises mainly unproven health claims.\n\nA Sophisticated Effort\n\nIn storefronts along Los Angeles\u2019 Boyd Street, a narrow commercial strip that has become a de facto bazaar for all things cannabis, there are displays of fake packaging and ready-to-fill vape cartridges for sale for popular brands including Heavy Hitters and Kingpen.\n\nAt one shop, the knock-off Heavy Hitter packages were selling for $225 for 100 empty cartridges and boxes; the Kingpen sets sell for $200. Counterfeit packaging and vape cartridges can also be easily found with a few mouse clicks on Alibaba, China\u2019s largest online commerce company, and other websites. Once purchased, a counterfeiter would add cannabis oil that is widely available in the illicit market \u2014 one recent online ad was selling oil for $6 a gram when purchased by the liter.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear who\u2019s behind all the different sales, and California law enforcement agencies have been overmatched by the widespread illegal market. In LA, the police department\u2019s chief focus is shuttering an estimated 200 illegal dispensaries across the city, not pursuing the source of fake vapes that might be for sale inside them, Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\n\nThus far, the state\u2019s illegal market has been operating largely unchecked, providing a ready market for fakes.\n\nOne recent study estimated that consumers are spending roughly $3 in the state\u2019s underground pot economy for every $1 in the legal one. Last week, state regulators raided two unlicensed shops selling bogus marijuana vapes in Southern California, seizing nearly $3 million in products. And in Wisconsin, authorities uncovered a 10-man operation that manufactured thousands of counterfeit vaping cartridges every day for almost two years loaded with oil containing THC, the high-producing ingredient in marijuana.\n\nA likely link between copycat vapes and the stores that sell them was illustrated on Aug. 28. An illegal shop padlocked by police in Los Angeles had a display case prominently displaying Kingpen vapes. The company said it had no relationship with the shop, which was selling vapes at bargain-basement prices, meaning they were almost certainly fakes.\n\nKingpen has taken matters into its own hands, suing Chinese companies that produce fake packaging, sending scores of cease-and-desist letters to businesses that sell them and filing complaints with the state, only to see nothing change.\n\n\u201cThere is no feedback. There is no action,\u201d said Danny Corral, Kingpen manufacturer Loudpack\u2019s vice president of sales.\n\nOthers have gone so far as to hire private investigators to locate illicit suppliers, but find dead ends. That\u2019s led many in the industry to believe the counterfeit operations are an organized, sophisticated practice.\n\n\u201cWe have every reason to believe that the same criminal gangs and cartels that dominate the global pharmaceutical counterfeit drug trade will similarly wrestle control of California\u2019s cannabis counterfeit drug trade,\u201d says a report compiled by Mammoth Distribution and submitted to state regulators. The company distributes Heavy Hitters.\n\nTaking Matters Into their Own Hands\n\nWith counterfeits leaching into California\u2019s illegal vape market, the threat for licensed companies is not just millions in lost revenue. They worry their highly valued brands could be forever tainted if people get a mouthful of foul-tasting vapor, or even become sick, from a bogus product carrying their name.\n\nTo fight off rampant counterfeiting, the parent company of Kingpen is preparing to shelve millions of dollars in packaging and hardware, then spend millions more launching a redesigned product.\n\nLoudpack is partnering with a technology company and this month plans to roll out an anti-counterfeiting program that will allow customers to verify the authenticity of Kingpen products purchased from licensed dispensaries in the state.\n\nThe rectangular paper box will be gone, replaced with a square, metal container. The company\u2019s logo remains, a rendering of a bearded, bloodshot-eyed king, but his face is partially obscured, like he is peering around a corner. There is also a unique code so consumers can validate the product.\n\nIn a statement, the company said it hopes the makeover will give consumers \u201cpeace of mind in knowing that any Kingpen product purchased legally is in fact authentic.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Counterfeit vaping gear could be linked to an emerging public health crisis that has sickened hundreds of people across the U.S.", "authors": ["Michael R.
