Ominously for Trump, Graham said the level of support in Congress would make this \"veto-proof.\"\n\nThere were strongly worded condemnations from other senior Republicans. Senator Marco Rubio called a US Syria retreat \"a grave mistake,\" while Nikki Haley, Trump's popular former UN ambassador, said leaving Kurds \"to die is a big mistake.\"\n\n- 'Wisdom' and obliteration -\n\nOften railing against the costly occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan and -- despite his bellicose rhetoric -- holding off from military strikes against Iran, Trump believes he is responding to public fatigue over seemingly intractable conflicts.\n\n\"The United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago,\" Trump said in one of his Monday tweets.\n\n\"Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out,\" he said.\n\nRepublican Rand Paul was one of the rare prominent voices backing Trump on \"his promises to stop our endless wars.\"\n\nBut even many of Trump's own allies appear to have run out of patience with what critics have long seen as a chaotic foreign policy.\n\nIn September, Trump made the stunning announcement that he'd been on the verge of meeting Taliban guerrilla leaders to cap months of mostly behind-closed-doors negotiations on a US military exit after two decades of war.\n\nInstead, Trump said in the same statement -- posted on Twitter -- he was canceling those talks entirely.", "description": "Despite a bizarre boast about his \"unmatched wisdom,\" President Donald Trump found himself dangerously isolated Monday as his erratic policy on Syria infuriated the Republicans he needs to save him from impeachment.
