I want people to know: I ended my child\u2019s life. At 23 weeks and six days into my pregnancy, I had a \u201clate term\u201d abortion. When people ask, \u201cHow could you?\u201d I reply that allowing her to live would have been a fate worse than death. Her diagnosis was not fatal, not incompatible with the bare mechanics of a living body. But it was incompatible with a fulfilling life. And that makes all the difference to me. That\u2019s why I call myself \u201cpro-life.\u201d\n\nThe night before our abortion (a procedure that takes three days to complete), President Trump delivered the annual State of the Union address.
