It's one of the most important oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, and the attack halved the kingdom's oil output, causing a spike in prices.\n\nThis Google Maps image shows the location of the Abqaiq Saudi Aramco oil facility in eastern Saudi Arabia.

This thesis suggests that the attacks were launched from Iran or Iraq, rather than Yemen, which is southwest of the facilities.\n\nIran has denied any responsibility for the attacks, but experts say that Iran frequently carries out attacks using proxies in order to maintain plausible deniability.\n\nIn a background briefing, US officials told the Times that that both drones and cruise missiles were used in the attack, with the scope, precision and sophistication of the attack likely beyond the capacity of Yemen's Houthi.\n\nA senior administration official told ABC News that Iran launched 12 cruise missiles and 20 drones from its territory in the attack on the facilities.\n\nOfficials also said that some of the weapons used in the attack failed to reach their target, and that analysis of them would yield more clues about who was likely responsible.\n\nExperts are calling for the US government to release more images for independent experts to analyse and assess the accuracy of US claims.\n\nPresident Trump in a tweet Sunday said the US was \"locked and loaded\" in response to the attack, but declined to name Iran as the culprit.", "description": "US officials released evidence that they claim points to Iranian responsibility for Saturday's attacks that crippled key Saudi oil facilities.", "authors": ["Tom Porter"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7f65262e22af12e323ed16-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
