(Olivier Matthys/AP)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing everything possible to have a deal (made), because I don\u2019t like the idea of no deal\u2026 this would have catastrophic consequences for Britain and the European Union.\u201d\n\nJuncker stated, in no uncertain terms, that the EU would be forced to reestablish a hard border on the island of Ireland if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the Oct. 31 deadline looming for a Brexit deal to be made, the issue of returning a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland remains a controversial subject, with Juncker saying that he\u2019s not married to the idea of an \u201cIrish backstop\u201d as long as a Brexit deal is made by Halloween.\n\nJuncker remains convinced that Brexit will happen, and warned that such \"catastrophic consequences\" of a no-deal Brexit could easily reignite tensions between Ireland and Northern Ireland that ended back in 1998 after the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an erotic relationship with the (so-called Irish) backstop, but if the results are there, I don\u2019t care about it,\u201d he said Sunday.\n\n\u201cIf the objectives are met, all of them, than we won\u2019t need the backstop. The backstop was just a guarantee, not an aim in and of itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am convinced that Brexit will happen.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said his meeting last week with British PM Boris Johnson regarding the looming Brexit deal deadline was \"positive,\" despite negative reports from the British press.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/boris-juncker-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
