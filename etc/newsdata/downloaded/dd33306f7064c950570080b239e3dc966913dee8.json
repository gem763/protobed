Photos: Kenneth Chan\n\nA reborn sprinter boasting a barnstorming finishing burst set the Group Two Premier Bowl (1,200m) alight on Sunday \u2013 but it was Seasons Bloom, not the enigmatic Pakistan Star, who stole the show.\n\nPre-race, all the attention was focused on Paul O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s two-time Group One winner and punters were keen to see if the experiment to turn him into a short-course specialist would be a success, many putting their hard-earned money on the line and backing Pakistan Star into $3.\n\nAnd when he loomed halfway down the straight the fans started to get excited, but he didn\u2019t go on with it.\n\n\u201cIt was another solid effort, but when it comes to the crunch under pressure, he just doesn\u2019t want to fight,\u201d jockey Zac Purton said.\n\nInstead it was Seasons Bloom who turned back the clock, coming from the back of the field to run over the top of his rivals and give jockey Grant van Niekerk his biggest victory in Hong Kong.\n\nDanny Shum Chap-shing\u2019s gelding had gone winless since capturing the Group One Stewards\u2019 Cup (1,600m) in January 2018, but a shift in focus has paid dividends.\n\nAfter running over distances ranging from 1,400m to 2,000m last season, Shum is keeping him to sprints this campaign and it is a move Seasons Bloom is relishing.\n\nSeasons Bloom flashes home to give Grant van Niekerk and Danny Shum the G2 Premier Bowl! #HKracing pic.twitter.com/AvtwvEXfyl \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 20, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s a terrific training effort to rejuvenate the seven-year-old, who spends most of his time at the Jockey Club\u2019s facility in Conghua.\n\n\u201cWe had a plan with the owners \u2013 which was very detailed \u2013 because we couldn\u2019t run him over 1,600m against Beauty Generation again. We can\u2019t beat him \u2013 he\u2019s a super champion,\u201d Shum said.\n\n\u201cSo we planned to run him in the Chief Executive\u2019s Cup on the opening day, he ran well, so we came to this race. We hoped he would run well again.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a sound horse, he\u2019s got 1,600m ability so he was strong at the end of 1,200m. He won very impressively.\n\n\u201cConghua helps him a lot. He really loves it. My team in Conghua has done a very good job, I would like to thank them.\u201d\n\nShum is building a strong team for December\u2019s Group One Longines Hong Kong Sprint with Seasons Bloom and rising star Regency Legend shaping as contenders.\n\n\u201c[Seasons Bloom] won\u2019t have another start until then, I will keep him fresh, keep him happy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHopefully we have two runners in the race. It all depends how Regency Legend runs on the 17th of November.\u201d\n\nVan Niekerk was delighted with Seasons Bloom\u2019s effort \u2013 particularly the way he picked up late.\n\n\u201cI honestly thought around the turn that I was not going to make it up because we never went that hard,\u201d he said. \u201cHe showed a great turn of foot that last 150m \u2013 he really dug down deep.\u201d\n\nThe South African is enjoying a strong start to the season \u2013 he now has seven wins after a double on Sunday \u2013 and is eyeing off bigger and better things.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting, hopefully I can build on that and a Group One can follow shortly,\u201d Van Niekerk said. \u201cI am the type of jockey that thrives on confidence and it helps if you get the chances.\u201d\n\nThe favourite Full Of Beauty ran another strong race, John Size\u2019s talented type finishing second.\n\n\u201cGood run, obviously we are a bit frustrated at not winning the race,\u201d jockey Joao Moreira said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to be very pleased with what he\u2019s done \u2013 he\u2019s always up there in the top four.\u201d\n\nAnd what to make of Pakistan Star?\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll come on with the run, he\u2019s an older horse first up for a long time,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said.\n\n\u201cHe seemed to handle the speed of the 1,200m all right and maybe under set weights he\u2019s going to be a long way better off. But it didn\u2019t completely answer all the questions I wanted it to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve given him four runs now and he\u2019s loomed up four times to win and won\u2019t go through with it.\n\n\u201cThe worst decisions in the world are made on a racecourse so I\u2019ll have to go home and think about what to do next.\u201d", "description": "A reborn sprinter boasting a barnstorming finishing burst set the Group Two Premier Bowl (1,200m) alight on Sunday \u2013 but it was Seasons Bloom, not the enigmatic Pakistan Star, who stole the show....", "authors": ["Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/20/1e24c2f2-f333-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_212133.JPG?itok=PaxsRGwL&v=1571577702", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
