He said no asset considered a haven performed well in Monday trade.\n\nThe market\u2019s awaiting news from the European Central Bank, which meets Thursday, as well as from the Federal Reserve, which meets next week, he added.\n\nDecember gold GCZ19, -0.30% fell by $4.40, or 0.3%, to settle at $1,511.10 an ounce after trading as high as $1,523.80. The most-active contract fell about 0.9% last week, according to FactSet data.\n\nSome commodity experts remain bullish and point to gold\u2019s trade above the $1,500-an-ounce mark as the demarcation line between bullish and bearish momentum in the commodity.\n\n\u201cThe main trend remains positive, even though prices are now playing with the psychological level of $1,500 and there could be space for a further correction to around $1,475, without affecting the main bullish trend,\u201d wrote Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at brokerage ActivTrades, in a daily research note.\n\nSilver for December delivery SIZ19, -0.59%, meanwhile, tacked on 4.8 cents, or 0.3%, to $18.167 an ounce, following a 1.2% slump for the week for gold\u2019s sister metal.\n\nAs for silver, which had enjoyed a powerful uptrend, up more than 11% last month \u2014 outperforming gold\u2019s monthly rally last month, up 6.4% \u2014 De Casa says its gains may have come too quickly and expects that prices for the gray metal \u201care likely to consolidate around these levels, before any further rebound attempt.\u201d\n\nTreasury yields rose Monday, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +5.18% up 6 basis points at 1.6114%. Rising bond yields can dull the luster of gold, which offers no yield.\n\nGold and silver have been supported by worries about anemic economic growth internationally and concerns that, combined with a Sino-American trade war, sluggish expansion may wash up on U.S. shores. On top of that, bond yields globally have offered rates that are ultralow or less than 0%, which also has bolstered appetite for precious metals which don\u2019t bear a yield.\n\nPrices for gold have climbed around 18% so far this year, while those for silver are up by roughly 17% over the same period. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.14% has climbed 15% year to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.01% has advanced 19% thus far in 2019, FactSet data show in Monday dealings.\n\nLast week, stocks gained some traction higher as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the job report is a sign of continued strength in the labor market. He also said the outlook for the economy remains favorable and the Federal Reserve is \u201cnot forecasting or expecting a recession.\u201d\n\nClosely watched employment data on Friday showed that the U.S. created a lackluster 130,000 new jobs in August, adding to evidence that hiring has slowed sharply in 2019. The increase in new jobs fell well short of the 170,000 MarketWatch forecast.\n\nOther metals traded on Comex declined, with December copper HGZ19, +0.00% down 0.3% to $2.6275 a pound.
