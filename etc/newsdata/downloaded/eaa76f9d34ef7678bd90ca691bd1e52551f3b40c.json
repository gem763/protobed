His agent sought a $20,000 advance, but Harper & Row coughed up only $10,000. The publisher initially printed just 5,000 copies. At first sales didn\u2019t amount to much, although the book got a nomination for an American Book Award.\n\nIt gained renown from pop culture, and positive references in the movie Good Will Hunting and the HBO show The Sopranos. Its sales increased year over year, until it had sold more than 2 million copies and been translated into at least 20 languages.\n\nThe work is built on a tendentious or partial account of events, not to mention outright falsehoods. In his review, Harvard University professor Oscar Handlin noted that \u201cZinn is a stranger to evidence bearing upon the peoples about whom he purports to write\u201d and slammed \u201cthe deranged quality of his fairy tale, in which the incidents are made to fit the legend, no matter how intractable the evidence of American history.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvidence be damned. Zinn\u2019s work is a go-to book on college campuses \u2014 for nearly everything. It shows up in courses not only in history but in political science, economics, literature, and \u2014 of course \u2014 women\u2019s studies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Zinn died, the Guardian called him a great man and the Russian TV network RT gushed that he had \u201climitless depth.\u201d The novelist Dave Eggers wrote in The New Yorker that he \u201cwas the embodiment of the term \u2018living legend,\u2019 and his effect on how we see and teach history is immeasurable.\u201d True enough, to his and our shame.\n\nPoets, novelists, lexicographers, and historians have, over the centuries, been central to excavating and delineating the identities of nations, toward the goal of establishing proud, self-governing peoples. In the United States, this class has turned its back on a nation-buttressing role and instead embraced a hostility to the American nation as such, to its cultural supports, its traditions, and its history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe clerisy has often been abetted in this project by leaders of the country, including government mandarins who were robustly nationalist until the latter half of the 20th century. \u201cThen in the 1960s and 1970s,\u201d the late social scientist Samuel Huntington wrote, \u201cthey began to promote measures consciously designed to weaken America\u2019s cultural and creedal identity and to strengthen racial, ethnic, cultural, and other subnational identities. These efforts by a nation\u2019s leaders to deconstruct the nation they governed were, quite possibly, without precedent in human history.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe live in their ongoing anti-national experiment.\n\nJust as nationalism, or at least loyalty to the nation-state, is very old, so is the impulse to move beyond mere local or national attachments. The word \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d has its root in the Greek word \u201ckosmopolites,\u201d or citizen of the cosmos or world.\n\nThe fourth-century b.c. Cynic philosopher Diogenes lived in Athens after his exile from his native Sinope and rejected all convention in favor of a life of virtue, making a barrel into his home in the Athenian marketplace. He is the first recorded person to use what has now become a cosmopolitan clich\u00e9: It is reported that \u201cwhen he was asked where he came from, he replied, \u2018I am a citizen of the world.\u2019\u201d This was a radical, even senseless, statement, since the Greeks considered citizenship possible only through the polis, or city.\n\nThe Stoics took the cosmopolitan baton from the Cynics. We exist in a local community by an \u201caccident of birth,\u201d according to the first-century Roman philosopher Seneca, but the world beyond is \u201ctruly great and truly common.\u201d We should \u201cmeasure the boundaries of our nation by the sun.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis tradition was recovered during the Enlightenment. In his 1753 work Le Cosmopolite, the widely traveled Louis-Charles Fougeret de Montbron maintained that \u201call the countries are the same to me\u201d and boasted that he changed \u201cmy places of residence according to my whim.\u201d\n\nCosmopolitanism came in different flavors, some more robust than others. It could refer merely to someone who traveled frequently and had a keen interest in the world. Or it could denote a desire for a world state. The 18th-century Prussian nobleman Anacharsis Cloots wanted to eliminate nations and establish a \u201crepublic of united individuals,\u201d based on the principle of one sovereign for all people. He was fired by enthusiasm for the French Revolution, which he considered a step toward that glorious outcome. He led a delegation of foreigners to the French National Constituent Assembly to declare the world\u2019s fealty to the Revolution\u2019s Declaration of the Rights of Man. The self-styled citoyen de l\u2019humanit\u00e9, or citizen of mankind, was eventually guillotined by his fellow revolutionaries when they falsely accused him of being part of, yes, a foreign plot.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind all cosmopolitanism is what the British writer Paul Gilroy has called \u201cthe principled and methodical cultivation of a degree of estrangement from one\u2019s own culture and history.\u201d As a result, cosmopolitanism has always been open to the charge that \u2014 whatever its broad-mindedness or idealism \u2014 it cultivates a contempt for what\u2019s near, immediate, and tangible, in favor of what\u2019s far away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharles Dickens skewered the character Mrs. Jellyby in his novel Bleak House for being so consumed with a humanitarian project in Africa that she neglected all around her, including her own children. She \u201chad a curious habit of seeming to look a long way off,\u201d as if she \u201ccould see nothing nearer than Africa!\u201d\n\nGetting at the same point, Rousseau commented that cosmopolitans \u201cboast that they love everyone, to have the right to love no one.\u201d\n\nThis is all the more important in the contemporary context. It used to be that cosmopolitanism was largely the attitude of philosophers and critics of society \u2014 outsiders. Diogenes, while he was eating and masturbating in public to outrage the bourgeoisie, never imagined governing Athens. Now a broadly cosmopolitan sensibility infuses our elite in government, academia, and business.\n\nAn American version of cosmopolitanism began to go off the rails in the early 20th century. In a 1915 essay in The Nation, the scholar Horace Kallen attacked standard notions of assimilation as a plot by the Anglo-Saxons for continued dominance. \u201cThe \u2018American race\u2019 is a totally unknown thing,\u201d he wrote, arguing instead for \u201ca democracy of nationalities.\u201d The common tongue of this democracy is still English, \u201cbut each nationality expresses its emotional and voluntary life in its own language.\u201d The country merely serves as a platform for multiple nations living within its borders: \u201cas the foundation and background for the realization of the distinctive individuality of each natio that composes it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRandolph Bourne picked up the theme in The Atlantic in a 1916 essay titled \u201cTrans-national America.\u201d He saw immigration as an opportunity to create \u201cthe first international nation,\u201d a \u201ccosmopolitan federation of national colonies.\u201d\n\nRadical at the time, this point of view steadily insinuated itself into the mainstream. Horace Kallen took a bow in 1972 as a 90-year-old, with multiculturalism on the rise. \u201cIt takes about 50 years for an idea to break through and become vogue,\u201d he stated. \u201cNo one likes an intruder, particularly when he is upsetting the commonplace.\u201d\n\nFueled by the rise of ethnic-pride movements in the 1960s and critiques of America as fundamentally racist and corrupt, the intellectual tide of multiculturalism swelled in the 1990s. In a typical expression of the worldview, the academic Amy Gutmann, who eventually became president of the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in favor of \u201cpublic recognition and preservation\u201d of \u201cdiscrete ethnic, linguistic, and other cultural groups.\u201d She insisted that our schools \u201cmust move beyond the morally misguided and politically dangerous idea of asking us to choose between being, above all, citizens of our own society or, above all, citizens of the world. We are, above all, none of the above.\u201d\n\nIt became in vogue \u2014 as John Fonte explains in his book Sovereignty or Submission: Will Americans Rule Themselves or Be Ruled by Others? \u2014 for curricula and standards to refer to the American \u201cpeoples.\u201d\n\nThe liberal political philosopher Richard Rorty argued in the mid 1990s that there was much to admire in the academic Left\u2019s focus on underrepresented groups. \u201cBut there is a problem,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwith this left: it is unpatriotic. In the name of \u2018the politics of difference,\u2019 it refuses to rejoice in the country it inhabits. It repudiates the idea of a national identity, and the emotion of national pride.\u201d\n\nRelatedly, the end of the Cold War engendered a newly potent transnationalism, contemptuous of national boundaries and supportive of institutions of global governance. In this view, old loyalties were not just anachronistic but morally unsupportable. The social critic Richard Sennett wrote of \u201cthe evil of a shared national identity.\u201d Professor of law and ethics Martha Nussbaum warned of the \u201cmorally dangerous\u201d dictates of \u201cpatriotic pride,\u201d commending instead a commitment to the \u201cworldwide community of human beings.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the intellectuals. American elites are enmeshed in the world of globalization \u2014 the enhanced travel and contacts, the multinational corporations, the NGOs. This inclines them to the view that the world is and should be ever more interconnected, and they are often fired by a near-messianic certitude that this trend is associated with the spread of all that is true and good. As Huntington points out, in the 19th century the growing sophistication and continental scale of American business promoted the nationalism of American elites over and against localism; now they promote the transnationalism of American elites over and against nationalism.\n\nGlobalization is real and the market a powerful force, but utopianism about trade and technology \u2014 supposedly driving us toward a borderless world and inevitable progress \u2014 has proven as facile and wrong as any other utopianism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, trade with China didn\u2019t radically transform its regime. The general secretary of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping, has effectively made himself president for life, centralizing power and writing authoritarian \u201cXi Jinping thought\u201d into the constitution.\n\nNo, social media haven\u2019t promoted liberalization. Once upon a time, leaders in tech boasted that, in the words of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in 2015, the Internet is a \u201cforce for peace\u201d in the world. That was before it became clear that tech was a powerful tool in the arsenal of Russia and China, that Facebook had played a role in ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, and that white nationalists and other extremists use social-media platforms as a tool of radicalization.\n\nAnd no, the nation isn\u2019t fading away, contrary to what has been constantly predicted by observers who wish it were.\n\nThe people who write down and teach our country\u2019s story share these anti-national attitudes. They have reversed the traditional role of historiography. For the longest time, the bounds of historical writing were set by the nation, which was the natural subject of historians. The modern nation-state and professional historiography grew up together.\n\nIn America, as the New York University historian Thomas Bender remarks, the very first histories focused on localities and states. The first national work, The History of the American Revolution, didn\u2019t appear until 1789, the year the Constitution went into effect. Americans still struck most observers as not very historically minded.\n\nJohn Adams plaintively asked a correspondent in 1813, \u201cCan you account for the Apathy, the Antipathy of this Nation to their own History? Is there not a repugnance to the thought of looking back? While thousands of frivolous Novels are read with eagerness and got by heart, the History of our own native Country is not only neglected, but despized and abhorred?\u201d\n\nIn a couple of decades, a more rigorous effort to document the country\u2019s founding and history would get underway. Key debates and documents were published, including in a series of books called \u201cAmerican Archives.\u201d It proudly announced, \u201cThe undertaking in which we have embarked is, emphatically, a National one: National in its scope and object, its end and aim.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was George Bancroft. A prodigious scholar and politically active Democratic statesman, he wrote the magisterial History of the United States, from the Discovery of the American Continent, published beginning in 1844.\n\nThe work stretched across ten volumes, written over the course of four decades, and eventually covered the years 1492 to 1789. Bancroft started his research by devoting a page of a blank book to each day of a year, and then, from his extensive reading, filled the page with every possible event that occurred on that date. His volumes became best sellers and earned him a fortune.\n\nThe scholar of nationalism Hans Kohn situated him within the great tradition of nationalist historians: \u201cBancroft, who occupies the same place in the development of American historiography and of the American national consciousness as Palack\u00fd does among the Czechs, Michelet among the French, Munch among the Norwegians, and Treitschke among the Germans, was a national historian not only because he saw national history in as favorable a light as possible but because he tried to formulate and document some of the most prominent traits of American national self-identification. He helped delineate the image that Americans formed of themselves.\u201d\n\nBancroft was unembarrassingly, unabashedly pro-American. He had a providential view of America that infused his History, and he believed in the essential beneficence of the American project.\n\nHis work may not meet contemporary professional standards, but America\u2019s historians have eschewed his approach and point of view entirely. They have turned their backs on the nation as a subject and, to the extent they take account of it, portray it as a vehicle of rapacity and misrule, as Howard Zinn did.\n\n\u201cIf love of the nation is what drove American historians to the study of the past in the nineteenth century,\u201d the Harvard historian Jill Lepore writes, \u201chatred for nationalism drove American historians away from it in the second half of the twentieth century.\u201d The discipline became obsessed with micro-topics dictated by identity politics, dismissive of the lay reader, and, of course, hostile to the nation as such.\n\nOur schools have run the same course. In the nationalist period after the Civil War, the teaching of American history flourished after a sustained push to emphasize it in curricula. Before the war, only a handful of states required history instruction; by the turn of the century, a majority of states did. And it was explicitly patriotic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the historian Merle Curti, the schools \u201cemphasized the importance of presenting vividly and attractively to children the glorious deeds of American heroes, the sacrifices and bravery of our soldiers and sailors in wartime, the personalities of presidents, who might properly be regarded as symbols of the nation in the manner in which royal personages of Europe were regarded. By the 1890s, state after state was requiring by law that subjects deemed peculiarly fitted to inculcating patriotism, such as American history and civics, be taught on every educational level below the college.\u201d\n\nAs the long nationalist era after the Civil War faded, so did the emphasis on patriotism in instruction. Patriotic themes disappeared from school readers steadily throughout the 20th century, and history itself has begun to vanish from our education system.\n\nLess than a fifth of colleges and universities require their students to take an American-history or -government course. Of the top colleges and universities in the country, only a fraction require even history majors to take a course in American history, although they often have geographic distribution requirements (which helpfully exclude the United States). Gender, racial, class, and environmental history have captured the heart of the academy.\n\nWorse, of course, there has been a deliberate effort to trash America\u2019s statesmen and heroes as exemplars of racism, sexism, and classism.\n\nIn 2014, a firestorm erupted over the College Board\u2019s new curriculum for Advanced Placement United States History. It didn\u2019t mention James Madison or Martin Luther King Jr. but did manage to name-check Chief Little Turtle and Mercy Otis Warren. It had a hostile view of the American experience, noting, for instance, that the British legacy here was \u201ca rigid racial hierarchy\u201d and minimizing the importance of the American Revolution.\n\nA group of more than a hundred scholars wrote a letter complaining that the new framework imposed \u201can arid, fragmentary, and misleading account of American history,\u201d in addition to downplaying \u201cAmerican citizenship and American world leadership in favor of a more global and transnational perspective.\u201d In sum, they wrote, the curriculum was \u201cso inattentive to the sources of national unity and cohesion, that it is hard to see how students will gain any coherent idea of what those sources might be.\u201d\n\nAfter denouncing its critics as chauvinistic hacks, the College Board reversed course and modified the curriculum. But the spirit that animated the effort in the first place is dominant in U.S. education and eating away at the foundations of our national project.\n\nMemory is what gives a nation its self-image and its sense of unity and coherence. It plays the same role in a country as it does in an individual, providing, in the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, \u201cthe cement, the bitumen, the matrix in which the other faculties are embedded.\u201d\n\nThe great historian William H. McNeill puts it well: \u201cA people without a full quiver of relevant agreed-upon statements, accepted in advance through education or less formalized acculturation, soon finds itself in deep trouble, for, in the absence of believable myths, coherent public action becomes very difficult to improvise or sustain.\u201d\n\nMcNeill cites the example of the British in World War II, who were fortified by what they had learned from their schoolbooks, namely that they had lost the initial battles in European conflicts but always prevailed in the end.\n\nArthur Schlesinger explains, \u201cAs the means of defining national identity, history becomes a means of shaping history.\u201d\n\nWhat historic challenges do the race, gender, and class obsessions of American historiographers prepare us for today? To win a campaign against heteronormativity? To beat ourselves up endlessly and dethrone historical figure after historical figure over white privilege? To be constantly watchful for the baleful effects of toxic masculinity?\n\nAn anti-national history is, on top of everything, profoundly ungrateful. It fails to credit our ancestors for achievements on an epic scale. It denies the continuities of our history and our dependence on men and women who didn\u2019t know us but bequeathed us the marvel of America. It runs counter to the inscription that John Adams wrote on the tombstone of his forebear Henry Adams: \u201cThis stone and several others have been placed in this yard, by a great great grandson from a veneration of the piety, humility, simplicity, prudence, patience, temperance, frugality, industry and perseverance of his Ancestors, in hopes of recommending an imitation of their virtues to their Posterity.\u201d\n\nWe have traveled a long way down from that sentiment, which is impossible to improve on more than two centuries later. If centuries of adventure, drama, striving, and achievement aren\u2019t to be wiped away in a \u201cgreat forgetting,\u201d the country needs an Americanizing campaign of civic and history education, suffused with a belief in the country\u2019s uniqueness and greatness and buttressed by its wayward elites.\n\n\u2013This essay has been adapted from The Case for Nationalism: How It Made Us Powerful, United, and Free, due from Broadside Books in November.", "description": "For much of our clerisy, the nation is an anachronism or disgrace.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "Ramesh Ponnuru", "Jay Nordlinger", "John Hirschauer", "Charles C.
