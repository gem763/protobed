In Angry Tweets, Trump Defends Pulling U.S. Troops From Syria", "language": "en", "text": "(WASHINGTON) \u2014 President Donald Trump lashed out Wednesday over sharp bipartisan criticism of his decision to pull back U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, saying he is focused on the \u201cBIG PICTURE\u201d that does not include American involvement in \u201cstupid endless wars\u201d in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cFighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East,\u201d Trump said in a series of morning tweets. \u201cThe stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!\u201d\n\nTurkey launched its offensive Wednesday, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announcing on his official Twitter account that the operation had begun. Erdogan said the operation aims to eradicate \u201cthe threat of terror\u201d against Turkey.\n\nRead more: \u2018My Great and Unmatched Wisdom\u2019: Trump Ignores Warnings on Syria Retreat, Threatens to \u2018Destroy\u2019 Turkish Economy\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nTurkey views the Syrian Kurdish fighters who have helped the U.S. against the Islamic State as terrorists, and Trump\u2019s decision to pull back U.S. troops leaves them vulnerable to the military onslaught. It\u2019s also been condemned by some of Trump\u2019s staunchest Republican allies.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close Trump ally, stepped up his criticism of the president Wednesday, telling \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that if Trump \u201cfollows through with this, it would be the biggest mistake of his presidency.\u201d \u201cI hope he\u2019s right. I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Graham said, comparing Trump\u2019s views to the \u201cpre-9/11 mentality that paved the way for 9/11.\u201d\n\nTrump defended his unpopular decision, arguing on Twitter that \u201cGOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY!\u201d He said the U.S. went to war under a \u201cfalse & now disproven premise, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. There were NONE!\u201d\n\nTrump said he is \u201cslowly & carefully\u201d bringing home \u201cour great soldiers & military,\u201d in line with his campaign promise to do so. He added: \u201cOur focus is on the BIG PICTURE! THE USA IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!\u201d\n\nBut the U.S. military has kept a decades-long focus on the Middle East as part of a strategy of stopping or minimizing security threats before they spread to American and allied shores.\n\nTrump has long criticized President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq in 2003, but the subsequent rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State has convinced many national security officials, and lawmakers such as Graham, that a precipitous U.S. troop withdrawal from the region would leave the U.S. and its allies even more vulnerable to extremism.\n\nTrump also claimed the U.S. has spent $8 trillion \u201cfighting and policing\u201d in the Middle East, up from the $7 trillion figure he has cited numerous times. (Trump is using an inflated estimate on the cost of wars and referring in part to predicted costs going decades into the future, not money actually spent. Some of the spending also reflects his policy decisions he made since taking office nearly three years ago.)\n\nGraham said Congress \u201cwill push back\u201d against Turkey. He had said earlier this week that he was working on a bipartisan bill to sanction Turkey if they invade Syria, but he did not mention the proposal during Wednesday\u2019s interview. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving Turkey a green light in Congress and we\u2019re not going to abandon the Kurds,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the President does so, we won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTrump announced Tuesday that he and Erdogan will meet at the White House on Nov. 13.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Trump lashed out Wednesday over bipartisan criticism of his move to pull U.S. troops from Syria, saying he is focused on the \"BIG PICTURE.\"", "authors": ["Darlene Superville"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trump-syria-kurd-tweets.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
