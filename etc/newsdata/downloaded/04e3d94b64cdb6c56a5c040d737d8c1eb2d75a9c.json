He obviously flails. \"I merely wish to answer in the affirmative fashion,\" he says, stumbling through answers to preliminary questions.\n\nPhillipe Layton gives Logan a call \u2013 \"I've always got time for my big shareholders,\" Logan says, trying to hide his annoyance \u2013 and suggests that Logan himself take the fall for the cruise cover-up.\n\nBut, yeah, that's not going to happen.\n\nWhat happens on the Roy family yacht stays on the yacht?\n\nCut to the Roy family (plus Gerri, Frank and others) on the family's yacht in the Mediterranean. What better spot to hash out who's going to walk the plank for a major scandal than out at sea? We get some nice one-liners (though perhaps nothing as clever as \"You can't make a Tomlette without breaking some Greggs\" from last week), though it's difficult to laugh knowing doom is coming for someone. (Several someones?)\n\nLater, Roman, Jaime and Karl return from their traumatizing Turkey trip. Jaime is confident the plan to take the company private is a go, but Roman expresses hesitation to Logan.\n\nLogan (Brian Cox) meets with Roman (Kieran Culkin, pictured) and his team.

Tensions begin to boil over: Connor asks Logan for help with Willa's play reviews and wants $100 million. Logan says he'll maybe give him the money if he quits the campaign. \"Everybody thinks you're a joke and you're (expletive) embarrassing me,\" Logan tells him, which, yes.\n\nLogan tells Kendall he wasn't properly informed about Naomi joining them and is (rightfully, for once) concerned about her association with Kendall's drug use.\n\nTense atmosphere before dinner. (Photo: Graeme Hunter/HBO)\n\nShiv arranges for a threesome for her and Tom, only to have Tom express discomfort with the plan once it's time. \"I feel like you're turning our threesome into a twosome\" Shiv says. Tom says he doesn't feel that naughty, which is both adorable and sad.\n\nThe next day at breakfast, Logan says he is the obvious choice to be sacrificed, and he'd like to announce it himself (which feels like a ploy). The group pushes back.\n\n\"I need one meaningful skull to wave.\" Logan says. \"I'll take care of whoever it is. No one will be forgotten.\"\n\nThat's when a game of sacrificial musical chairs begins: Kendall suggests Gerri, who Roman obviously defends. \"Haven't we, kidding here, killed enough women already?\" Roman ask. Roman suggests Tom, and Kendall and Karl double down. Shiv says \"Tom looks logical\" in an incredulous moment, but tries manipulating it into a defense.\n\nRoman next posits Tom with \"Greg sprinkles.\" \"I'm more than a sprinkle,\" Greg says, which should go on a T-shirt.\n\nLogan and Kendall go to meet with Stewy off-yacht and try to broker a deal, but no luck. It's really going to have to be the sacrifice, isn't it?\n\nTom confronts Shiv about their relationship struggles. \"You told me you wanted an open relationship on our (expletive) wedding night,\" Tom tells her. \"I'm not a hippie, Shiv,\" he adds. It looks like Shiv is going to have to make a choice to save their marriage. She sticks up for him to Logan (but not before Tom, confusingly, steals a piece of chicken off Logan's plate in an absurd comic relief moment).\n\nLogan dangles the proverbial CEO carrot in front of her. \"It's the sort of tough choice people need to be able to make,\" Logan says about this decision. She tells him she can't choose, but implores him to not cut Tom.\n\nShiv (Sarah Snook) and Logan (Brian Cox). (Photo: Graeme Hunter/HBO)\n\nWho is the sacrifice? But who really gets sacrificed?\n\nAnd that leaves us with \u2026 Kendall. Logan tells him he wants Kendall to admit to knowing about the cover-up and to say that it went no higher. Kendall agrees, but asks Logan if he ever thought he could've been the CEO successor. After some wavering: \"You're not a killer,\" Logan says, which is ironic given Kendall's responsibility in last season finale's death. \"You have to be a killer.\"\n\nKendall says maybe he deserves it, referencing the incident.\n\nBut when it comes time for the press conference \u2013 which Logan is watching from the yacht \u2013 Kendall pivots and eviscerates Logan as a \"malignant presence\" to the gaggle of reporters. He calls him a bully and a liar and says Logan was aware of the events for many years and made efforts to cover them up.\n\n\"The notion that he would have allowed millions of dollars in settlements and compensation to be paid without his explicit approval is utterly fanciful,\" Kendall says, adding that he has copies of records that show Logan's personal sign-off. \"I think this is the day his reign ends,\" he adds.\n\nUh \u2026 now what?\n\nWow: 'Succession' star Kieran Culkin is a dad! Wife Jazz Charton gave birth without 'pain meds'\n\nWay back when, from our critic: HBO can't succeed with corporate media-family drama 'Succession'\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/14/succession-season-finale-recap-kendall-eviscerates-logan-shock/3971932002/", "description": "It wouldn't be a \"Succession\" season finale without a shock\u00a0\u2013 but this was one Logan Roy himself may have trouble surviving.", "authors": ["David Oliver", "Published A.M.
