And the crime rate? Oh! Ridiculously low! That\u2019s in part thanks to the approximately 6,000 24-hour-staffed police boxes that cover the country in a network of uniformed protection.\n\nPapers, please!\n\nBut does all that security come at a cost?\n\nIn Japan, walking around without identification papers on your person is technically illegal. Japanese law allows patrolling officers to stop a random person at any time to check their ID. The people they inevitably choose? Those who don\u2019t look \u201cJapanese.\u201d\n\nEven if you\u2019ve done nothing wrong at all, if you\u2019re caught empty-handed you could be arrested and taken straight to the police station. A couple of months back, an unlucky Indonesian tourist forgot her passport at her hotel and, while separated from her travel group, got held for several days by the police who mistook her for an illegal immigrant worker.\n\nBut I\u2019m Japanese!\n\nFor a long time, Japanese society has entertained the myth that Japan is a homogenous homeland, free of discrimination because, well, everyone is the same.\n\nBut, in recent years, in particular, there\u2019s been a steadily growing number of Japanese nationals of foreign descent (in addition to an increase in the number of foreign residents) that is challenging that misconception loud and clear.\n\nWhether we choose to see it or not, discrimination exists in Japan. Among the body of evidence is how appearance-based identity control checks are conducted on the street.\n\nJapanese nationals don\u2019t have an ID card and they have no reason to carry their passport on them day-to-day either. But incidents like the one @zainulabaden experienced suggests that some Japanese people might have to\u2014just to be safe.\n\n\u50d5 \uff08 \u307c\u304f \uff09 \u306f\u30d1\u30ad\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3 \u7cfb \uff08 \u3051\u3044 \uff09 \u65e5\u672c\u4eba \uff08 \u306b\u307b\u3093\u3058\u3093 \uff09 \u3067\u3059\u3002 \u56fd\u7c4d \uff08 \u3053\u304f\u305b\u304d \uff09 \u3082 \u65e5\u672c \uff08 \u306b\u307b\u3093 \uff09 \u3067\u3059\u3002 \u9854 \uff08 \u304b\u304a \uff09 \u306f\u3053\u308c\u3067\u3082\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u306a\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\u8077\u8cea \uff08 \u3057\u3087\u304f\u3057\u3064 \uff09 \u306b\u306f \u5354\u529b \uff08 \u304d\u3087\u3046\u308a\u3087\u304f \uff09 \u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057 \u6700\u521d \uff08 \u3055\u3044\u3057\u3087 \uff09 \u304b\u3089\u300c \u5728\u7559 \uff08 \u3056\u3044\u308a\u3085\u3046 \uff09 \u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u300d\u300c\u30d1\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306f\u300d\u300c\u306a\u3044\u306a\u3089 \u902e\u6355 \uff08 \u305f\u3044\u307b \uff09 \u3057\u306a\u304d\u3083\u3044\u3051\u306a\u3044\u3088\u300d\u3068 \u8a00 \uff08 \u3044 \uff09 \u3046 \u805e \uff08 \u304d \uff09 \u304d \u65b9 \uff08 \u304b\u305f \uff09 \u306f \u5acc \uff08 \u3044\u3084 \uff09 \u306a \u6c17\u5206 \uff08 \u304d\u3076\u3093 \uff09 \u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\n\n\u300c \u672c\u4eba \uff08 \u307b\u3093\u306b\u3093 \uff09 \u78ba\u8a8d \uff08 \u304b\u304f\u306b\u3093 \uff09 \u66f8\u985e \uff08 \u3057\u3087\u308b\u3044 \uff09 \u306e \u63d0\u793a \uff08 \u3066\u3044\u3058 \uff09 \u3092\u304a \u9858 \uff08 \u306d\u304c \uff09 \u3044\u3057\u307e\u3059\u300d\u304c \u9069\u5207 \uff08 \u3066\u304d\u305b\u3064 \uff09 \u3067\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u9854\u3067\u3082\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u306a\u3093\u3067\u3059\n\n= I\u2019m Japanese of Pakistani origin.
