Coleen Rooney accuses Rebekah Vardy of leaking stories", "language": "en", "text": "Cape Town - Former England captain Wayne Rooney's wife, Coleen, on Wednesday sensationally accused Rebekah Vardy - wife of Leicester City striker, Jamie - of selling stories of her personal life to the press.\n\nColeen Rooney in a Twitter rant accused Rebekah Vardy of leaking information from her personal Instagram account - including her Instagram stories - to The Sun newspaper for years.\n\nRebekah hit back to deny the \"hurtful\" claims while saying that a number of people had access to her Instagram account over recent years and hit out at Coleen for her public accusations especially at a time where she is heavily pregnant.\n\nColeen went to extraordinary lengths to expose the leak after she revealed that she had blocked all of her followers from viewing her Instagram stories except one - the account belonging to Rebekah Vardy.\n\nDuring this time several fake stories planted by Coleen were indeed leaked to and published by The Sun newspaper.\n\nColeen wrote: \"For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing the sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n\"There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and family - all without my permission or knowledge.\n\n\"After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n\"To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except one account (those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.).\n\n\"Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did!\n\n\"The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the later story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\"It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to.\n\n\"Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from. I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n\"It's..... Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\"\n\nThis has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it...... pic.twitter.com/0YqJAoXuK1 \u2014 Coleen Rooney (@ColeenRoo) October 9, 2019\n\nRebekah then hit back claiming that her account could have been hacked while calling the accusations as \"disgusting\".\n\n\"As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n\n\n\"I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n\n\n\"If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\n\n\n\"Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.\"I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\n\n\nI liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n\n\n\"I'm disgusted that I'm even having o deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\"\n\nIn an interesting stat, while team-mates for England Wayne Rooney and fellow striker Jamie Vardy have not created a goalscoring chance for one another on international duty.\n\n0 - Despite spending four hours & 22 minutes together on the pitch for England in total, Jamie Vardy and Wayne Rooney never created a single goalscoring chance for one another.
