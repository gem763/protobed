To win, Morales needed more than 40 percent of the vote and a 10-point lead over the second-leading candidate.\n\nIf the results maintain, the run-off will take place on Dec. 15.\n\nThe 66-year-old Mesa of the Civic Community Party called the result a \u201ctriumph\u201d before his supporters in La Paz.\n\n\u201cThis is no ordinary election,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is the destiny of Bolivia, what\u2019s at stake is the democracy of our country.\u201d\n\nHowever, after the Supreme Electoral Tribunal stopped announcing ongoing ballot counting, he took to Twitter to demand that it continue with the tally.\n\n\u201cThe [Supreme Electoral Tribunal] once again fails to meet its commitments,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 We demand that the count be resumed!!! What is happening is very serious.\u201d\n\nThe Organization of American States asked the electoral tribunal to explain why it stopped announcing the count.\n\nMorales, 59, a former cocoa farmers union leader, reassured his supporters in La Paz that he would win the election once all the rural votes were counted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, sisters and brothers, we\u2019re going to wait until the last vote is counted to pursue and continue our process of change,\u201d he said.\n\nMorales was elected the country\u2019s first indigenous president in 2005 after Mesa stepped down. However, Morales has come under increasing scrutiny due to the country\u2019s growing deficit and accusations of corruption in the government.", "description": "Oct. 21 (UPI) \u2014 With over 80 percent of ballots counted, Bolivia appeared headed to a run-off election as President Evo Morales failed to win the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
