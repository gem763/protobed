This week we look at how to make your bedroom feel cozier, no matter how large it may be.\n\n\n\nA master bedroom often provides a super-sized space to \"call it a night.\u201d But with so much room to lay your head, all that extra square footage can feel wasted or cold.\n\n\n\nYet, with some strategic attention to color, the right furniture placement and materials used throughout, you can easily warm up the space so it feels more snug. Follow these tips from design pros to make the space a comfy sanctuary.\n\nMore: Go Bold With Living Room Accent Colors\n\nWork With Scale\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll often choose a darker wall color to create a more intimate atmosphere for the room. Beyond color on the walls, sometimes I\u2019ll opt for a textured wallpaper, often in earthy hues. The subtle complexity of the texture brings in a layer of warmth, something I\u2019m always looking for in a large space that also adds a layer of drama. If the room has a high ceiling, I\u2019ll look for ways to \u2018bring it down.\u2019 To me, that means playing with scale, and headboards are one of my favorite design elements to help accomplish that; a headboard with a high back, or even one that takes up an entire wall.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother way I like to work with a very high ceiling is by adding dramatically lit art. It not only sets a moody tone but also forces our eyes to rise a bit, which helps with scaling down the ceiling. I love adding mirrors to either side of the bed. Not only do they act as windows, but they also reflect the light that glows from the bedside lamps, bringing a feeling of warmth to the space.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe right placement of furniture will take any large room and make it feel just right for the people living in it. I like placing seating areas\u2014which to me means two extremely comfortable upholstered chairs\u2014at the foot of the bed with a beautifully upholstered ottoman in between. The arrangement fills the room, creates a lovely composition for our eye to take in, and adds the perfect cozy spot to curl up and finally finish reading that book.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarm neutral hues and oversized seating bring a sense of comfort to a bedroom designed by LeeAnn Baker.

Even though a simple color palette is a go-to for us, it\u2019s great to infuse pops of texture and dimension into a larger space. We do this in art, accessories and woven window shades. Different textures keep everything from feeling flat and monotone.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe biggest misconception with larger spaces, is that adding properly scaled pieces will make the room feel tight or cluttered. We always utilize the length of the wall\u2014selecting larger chests as nightstands and a prominent bed or upholstered headboard. This anchors the room and keeps the space grounded. In comparison, furniture that is too small, or too many furniture pieces in a room, can make the space feel cluttered and even larger.\n\n\n\n\u201cSteering away from too many patterns is important in any space, but even more so in a larger space. If we design a bedroom with a patterned rug, then we infuse more texture and contrast and keep additional patterns to a minimum. If there is a pattern on the drapery, then we tend to lean toward a more neutral rug. Also, upholstery goes a long way. If you have case goods such as a dresser and nightstands that are wood or metal, then go for an upholstered headboard and sofa at the foot of the bed to keep a balance and infuse some softness.\n\n\n\n\u201cArtwork and accessories complete a space. Make sure you are using properly scaled pieces, as an oversized piece of art can do wonders to anchor a large empty wall.\n\n\n\n\u201cConsider adding a seating area in a corner or at the foot of the bed. Benches, small settees, and unique chairs are a great way to add personality to a room and make it cozier. And don\u2019t forget plants, which warm a space immediately.\u201d\n\n\n\nTextural touches and plush fabrics give a bedroom designed by LeeAnn Baker a warm approachability.

For a recent project at 400 West 12th St. [in Manhattan], we started with a beautiful textured white duvet as our base and built up from there. Adding layers of darker velvets and wools with the coverlet and pillows creates depth you want to dive into.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn terms of materials, think soft and luxurious\u2014velvet, cashmere and linen. As we approach winter, you can't go wrong with a fur to add dimension and comfort. It\u2019s also very important to go big with your rug. Too small of a rug will shrink your space.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014 Jennifer Lannon, senior project manager for New York-based luxury real estate design and marketing firm Interior Marketing Group\n\nMore: How to Design an Eclectic Table That\u2019s Ideal for Entertaining\n\nCreate a Textural Touch\n\n\n\n\u201cWe like to think of the master bedroom as a sanctuary from the rest of an often times hectic home, so we typically stick to a soft palette, often in icy blues or lavenders.\n\n\u201cA canopy bed with curtains is a great way to create a cozy feel in an otherwise open space. And if there is room for a sitting area, a reading nook is always welcome.\n\n\u201cSuper-soft luxurious fabrics are the best way to make a room feel cozy. Velvets and chunky woven linens create beautiful layers, and in a room where there is less traffic and a kid-free zone, splurge for the best. A cozy oversized throw blanket on the end of the bed is always a welcome finishing touch to complete the cozy bedroom vibe.\u201d\n\nDesigned by Christine Markatos Lowe, an upholstered bed and drapery lend a sense of coziness to the bedroom.
