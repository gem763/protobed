So we asked celebrity chef and restaurateur Marc Murphy to teach us how to create the perfect board.\n\nMurphy, who is a regular judge on \"Chopped\" and recently hosted the 12th annual New York City Wine & Food Festival, said the most important factors are quality and variety.\n\n(MORE: This 24-layer rainbow crepe cake is the birthday cake of your childhood dreams)\n\n\"For me, a cheese board really has to have variety,\" Murphy said. \"It has to have a couple different types of cheese, a couple different types of meats ... and some accouterments around there.\"\n\nThen, go for the good stuff.\n\nPHOTO: Chef Marc Murphy makes a cheese board in New York City, Oct. 8, 2019.

Put your cheeses on the outside edges the board, so it's easier for people to cut the cheese.\n\n2. Place your meats in the center of the board, surrounded by the cheeses.\n\n3. Add nuts in a small bowl to the plate.\n\n4. Sprinkle olives around the center.\n\n5. If there's room to add crackers and bread to the board, do that. Otherwise, place those around the board.\n\nPHOTO: A platter of cheese and meats made by chef Marc Murphy in New York City, Oct. 8, 2019.
