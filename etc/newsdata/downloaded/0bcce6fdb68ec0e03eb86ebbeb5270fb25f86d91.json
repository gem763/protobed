(Photo: Ecco)\n\nThe racial tensions in LA that exploded into violence in the early 1990s following the Rodney King verdict haven\u2019t gone away. Yet they\u2019re often perceived as history \u2013 a thing that happened, the stuff of documentaries. Steph Cha, in her impassioned debut thriller, \u201cYour House Will Pay\u201d (Ecco, 320 pp., \u2605\u2605\u2605 out of four stars), wants to blow the dust off that moment and make clear that yesterday\u2019s divides still haven\u2019t been fully reckoned with.\n\nTo make that case, Cha assuredly braids the stories of two families. Shawn, whose teenage sister Ava was fatally shot by a shop owner in 1991, has become the default patriarch of a clan determined to keep Ava\u2019s memory alive. Grace, the daughter of the shooter \u2013 though she was kept in the dark about that fact for decades \u2013 has been untouched by the incident.\n\n\u201cShe had let herself luxuriate in apathy, her world separate from the real world,\u201d Cha writes.\n\nThe real world violently intrudes when Grace\u2019s mother is shot, and Shawn\u2019s cousin, recently released from prison, becomes the lead suspect. Shawn\u2019s family is black, while Grace\u2019s is Korean, and the shooting resurfaces a volatile, often stereotype-driven dynamic between the two communities. Grace\u2019s activist sister attempts to explain all this, but Grace rolls her eyes and dismisses the history lesson.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not history, Grace,\u201d Miriam retorts. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2013\u201d\n\nMore: Ronan Farrow says NBC\u2019s alleged cover-up of sexual misconduct is \u2018bigger\u2019 than Matt Lauer\n\nThe sentence cuts off. It\u2019s \u2013 what? The strength of Cha\u2019s novel isn\u2019t just that she understands that the problem doesn\u2019t reduce so simply. It\u2019s how well she inhabits the multiple communities involved, each wearing their own sets of blinkers. The media either lapses into melodrama and oversimplification (via the white journalist who wrote a book on Ava\u2019s death) or stokes bigotry (via the right-wing meme factory that catches Grace in an impolitic moment). Shawn\u2019s family\u2019s urge to keep Ava\u2019s story alive has helped fuel an attitude of grievance and retribution; Grace\u2019s family\u2019s determination to avoid the past only leads to stubborn, festering ignorance.\n\n\u201cThe spilled poisons of the grown-up world\u201d don\u2019t just trickle down to the sons and daughters of the participants, Cha suggests. They infect the institutions that are supposedly there to clean up, including the police and criminal-justice system.\n\n\u201cLast thing we need is for people to be thinking about the early nineties,\u201d a detective says, but the evidence suggests nobody has ever been thinking about it enough.\n\nAuthor Steph Cha. (Photo: Maria Kanevskaya)\n\nCha has taken care not to write a cynical book; indeed, she dives so deep into her characters because she believes that communicating their nuances across racial lines is essential to heal the wound. But the novel\u2019s fiery conclusion emphasizes how difficult that work will be.\n\n\u201cYour House Will Pay\u201d is based on a 1991 incident in which a 15-year-old black girl was killed by a Korean shop owner over a petty misunderstanding. Cha grasps the symbolic power of that story, the way it clarifies so many American social challenges. \u201cWhere was the new city?\u201d she asks in the novel\u2019s closing moments. \u201cAnd who were the good men?\u201d\n\nCha\u2019s novel is both a page-turner and a prompt to confront those questions.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/15/steph-cha-interrogates-la-racial-tensions-your-house-pay-review/3947738002/", "description": "Steph Cha\u2019s breakout novel \"Your House Will Pay\" is a smart page-turner that confronts the lingering racial tensions of 1990s LA.", "authors": ["Mark Athitakis", "Special For Usa Today", "John Sandford", "Rachel Maddow", "Delia Owens", "Stephen King", "Ta-Nehisi Coates", "Published A.M.
