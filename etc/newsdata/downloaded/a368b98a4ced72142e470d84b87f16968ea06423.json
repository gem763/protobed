And he handed me a wooden wine box.\n\n\u201cI opened it up and inside there was money and a piece of paper that said it was for my legal costs.\n\n\u201cHe closed the box, screwed up the paper and we walked downstairs.\u201d\n\n'I didn't want to explain it to her'\n\nMr Clements became teary-eyed as he described his reaction: \u201cI had a lot going on. I was about to be interviewed by the police. I believed I was about to lose my job. I had had to confess to my wife to having an affair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownstairs, \u201cwe sat there and had a chat\u201d, he said. \"And Mr Huang talked to me about being concerned for me, and that everything was going to be OK.\u201d\n\nMr Clements counted the money in the car \u2013 $100 bills in seven packets of $5000.\n\nHe never banked the money: \u201cI had a joint bank account with my wife and I didn\u2019t, given the amount of strife I was in, want to explain it to her.\u201d\n\nHe kept the $35,000 in a cupboard at home for more than six months, using it over time to pay part of his legal bills, he said,\n\nTwo months earlier, at the end of May 2015, he had asked Mr Huang to provide $10,000 to fund a union election campaign, where a right-wing union was facing a challenge.\n\nSeveral days later, Mr Huang\u2019s personal assistant had come to his office and handed Mr Clements a white A4 envelope.\n\nAccording to his evidence, Mr Clements earned more than $600,000 from Mr Huang\u2019s companies after he was hired as a consultant on a retainer of $4000 a week, days after he resigned as state secretary in mid-January 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nICAC Chief Commissioner Peter Hall asked how the level of $4000 was set by Mr Huang.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I suggested,\u201d Mr Clements said. \u201cHe ultimately agreed.\u201d\n\nHe said Mr Huang contacted him via a WhatsApp message on July 19, 2017 and asked to see him.\n\nAccording to Clements' evidence, Mr Huang told him the Electoral Commission was inquiring into a Chinese Friends of Labor fundraiser, and that a Labor staffer, Kenrick Cheah, had said that Mr Huang had handed $100,000 to Mr Clements in an \u201cAudi bag\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhy the fuck would Kenrick say that?\u201d Mr Clements said he asked Mr Huang.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr Huang told Mr Clements, he said. \u201cI left the dinner early.
