Husky also owns refineries in the U.S. at Lima and Toledo, Ohio and Superior, Wisconsin, according to its website. The Superior refinery is undergoing repairs from a fire and won\u2019t reopen until next year, the company reported earlier.\n\nHusky said it would use the cash from the sale to strengthen its balance sheet and return value to shareholders. It\u2019s also entering a five-year off-take agreement with Tidewater for refined products from the Prince George refinery. Tidewater is keeping all of the facility\u2019s staff, Husky said.\n\nCalgary-based Tidewater says it plans to finance the deal through an increase of an existing credit facility of up to $600 million and a $100 million second lien term loan, according to Bloomberg. Tidewater sees the pact adding more than 50 per cent to 2020 distributable cash flow per share, the news agency reported.\n\nTidewater focuses on natural gas processing, fractionation, liquids upgrading, transportation, storage, and marketing, according to its website. Its core operations are in the Deep Basin area of western Alberta, Edmonton, and Montney regions of Alberta and B.C., it said.\n\nSeveral linked projects and assets across Canada\u2019s west and the U.S. comprise what Husky calls its Integrated Corridor. These include thermal projects to heat and extract oil from tar sands at Lloydminster on the Saskatchewan-Alberta border, as well as at Cold Lake and Ft. McMurray, Alberta.\n\nIts Lloydminister assets include an asphalt refinery and an oil upgrader that turns heavy oil into synthetic crude, and a 35 per cent share in 1,900 km of pipeline through the area. It has 4.1 million barrels of oil storage at Hardisty, Alberta, and a string of plants that produce 260 million litres of ethanol a year, according to its website.\n\nHusky\u2019s resource plays are weighted 70 per cent gas as a hedge against its heavy crude output and refineries, it said.\n\nHusky\u2019s offshore production includes the Jeanne d\u2019Arc basin off Newfoundland and Labrador as well as gas projects in Chinese and Indonesian waters, its website shows.\n\n\u2022 Email: cmcclelland@postmedia.com", "description": "Oil and gas producer to focus on atlantic Canada and the Asia Pacific region", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/husky.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
