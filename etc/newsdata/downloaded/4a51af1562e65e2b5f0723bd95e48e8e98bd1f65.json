Tanks for at least two of the county\u2019s eight stations were wrongly filled with gasoline, he said, and one station was back online within an hour.\n\nThe county is working with a recovery team to dispose of the contaminated fuel, Owens said. The contractor, James River Petroleum, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nPrince George County is occasionally mistaken for Prince George\u2019s County, Md., leading officials in the Maryland county to issue a statement after a news service issued a bulletin about the fuel mix-up.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The fuel mix-up sidelined ambulances and firetrucks in Prince George County.", "authors": ["Justin Wm.
