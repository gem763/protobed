Even if we had drawn 0-0 I would have been delighted, but we deserved to win,\u201d added Lampard.\n\n\u201cWhat a performance against a team that are fantastic on the ball. It was our work ethic and quality that proved the difference.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nAjax captain Dusan Tadic bemoaned too many errors on the part of the Dutch hosts.\n\n\u201cIt was a 50-50 game. Chelsea are a good team but we could have done better. We were sloppy and made too many mistakes.\u201d\n\nThe two clubs meet again on Nov. 5 at Stamford Bridge in their next group outing.", "description": "A late goal by substitute Michy Batshuayi propelled Chelsea to a 1-0 win at Ajax Amsterdam on Wednesday for a second Champions League victory in Group H after a fast and furious tussle at the Johan Cruijff Arena.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444227307&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1VA", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
