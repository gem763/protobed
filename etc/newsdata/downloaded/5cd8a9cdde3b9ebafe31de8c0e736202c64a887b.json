With tax, the new fee is $51.02.\n\nThe resort fee at Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino, an older, more affordable hotel just off the Las Vegas Strip, is going from $32 a night to $35 plus tax, bringing it to nearly $40 a night.\n\nAll of the hotels are owned or operated by Las Vegas casino giant Caesars Entertainment Corp., which is in the process of being sold to El Dorado Resorts.\n\nThe new fees will bring the resort fees at the hotel \"in line with relevant competitors,'' Caesars spokeswoman Kristin Soo Hoo said.\n\nThe increase comes despite an intense spotlight on the fee travelers love to hate, with new legislation in Congress and lawsuits against major hotel chains.\n\nAnd it comes just a couple months after the CEO of Caesars Entertainment told Wall Street analysts rising resort fees are something the chain needs to be \"a little bit cautious about.''\n\n\"I don't think we're there yet, but I want us to be very judicious and ... cautious about taking those rates any further.'' CEO Tony Rodio said during the company's quarterly earnings conference call in early August.\n\nHe called resort fees a \"revenue stream that's hard to walk away from.''\n\nThe $45 fee will bring Caesars and Nobu in line with other top-tier hotels on The Strip. MGM Resorts raised fees at Bellagio, Vdara and Aria, its top Las Vegas hotels, to $45 plus tax earlier this year, as did Wynn and Encore.\n\nVenetian and Palazzo, sister all-suite hotels on The Strip, started the $45 a night trend in 2018.", "description": "The nightly resort fee at Caesars Palace is going from $39 to $45.
