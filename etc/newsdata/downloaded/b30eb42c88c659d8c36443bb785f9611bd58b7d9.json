REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo\n\nSome of the next round of strikes will coincide with multi-day strikes by Ryanair pilots and cabin crew in Spain.\n\nBALPA members said they will walk out again on Sept. 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29. Ryanair\u2019s Spanish pilots will also be on strike on Sept 19, 27 and 29, while the ninth of 10 strike days called by their cabin crew colleagues is due on Sept. 27.\n\nWhile widespread strikes over pay and conditions a year ago forced Ryanair to cancel hundreds of flights, the first series of strikes since then in Britain, Spain and Portugal has caused minimal disruption in recent weeks.\n\nRyanair flights to and from Britain ran as scheduled over the last three days during BALPA\u2019s latest strike, having also caused no cancellations during the union\u2019s first walkout last month.\n\nSo far only 14 Spanish flights have been affected by the industrial action, representing less than one percent of the Irish airline\u2019s daily schedule to and from Spain.\n\nIn a statement Ryanair described the latest BALPA strikes as \u201cpointless\u201d given their initial industrial action had caused zero cancellations.\n\nRyanair has said only around half of the pilots operating from UK airports are members BALPA.\n\nBALPA said the airline was using contractors, who are not entitled to join unions, and crews from other jurisdictions to ensure flights operated.\n\n\u201cWe are clear that we want to settle the dispute and bring about a change in Ryanair for the better. Ryanair should stop dragging its feet,\u201d BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said in a statement.", "description": "Ryanair members of the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) on Wednesday announced a further seven days of strikes as their latest walkout comes to an end, having caused little disruption for the low-cost airline.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426223527&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831QD"}
