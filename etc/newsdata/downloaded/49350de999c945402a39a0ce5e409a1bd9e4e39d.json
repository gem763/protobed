This is your password\u2019,\u201d Mr Balmas said.\n\n'Day jobs'\n\nCheck Point monitored one Bitcoin wallet used to collect funds from the scam and found about 11 bitcoin - almost $100,000 - was collected in a five-month period.\n\n\u201cMost people don't fall for sextortion scams,\u201d Mr Balmas said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the rule of big numbers. If I'm sending 100,000 sextortion emails, it\u2019s enough that 100 people fall for the trap. I get my money.\u201d\n\nHe said it was likely the same botnet was being used to carry out other, more lucrative attacks, such as the theft of credit card details.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not somebody doing this from his garage,\u201d Mr Balmas said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a group of individuals doing this for their day jobs. This is their business.\u201d\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?
