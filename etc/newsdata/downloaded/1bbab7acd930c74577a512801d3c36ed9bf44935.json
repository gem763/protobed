Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) advocated for mixed-sex prisons as part of the \u201cLGBTQ+ Rights and Equality\u201d plan she released on Thursday, hours before the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s town hall on CNN.\n\nWarren detailed her proposal in a Medium post, painting a bleak picture of the state of LGBT rights under the Trump administration. She accused the Trump White House of weaponizing the \u201clanguage of religion\u201d and giving entities a \u201clicense to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people.\u201d\n\nWhile Warren\u2019s proposal contains a swath of promises of protections for LGBT individuals, the presidential hopeful specifically vowed to mix federal prisons, allowing men to move into women\u2019s prisons on the basis of \u201cgender identity\u201d rather than biological sex. She said she would instruct the Bureau of Prisons to house transgender inmates according to their identified sex, much like the Obama administration did in January 2017.\n\nWarren\u2019s plan states:\n\nI will direct the Bureau of Prisons to end the Trump Administration\u2019s dangerous policy of imprisoning transgender people in facilities based on their sex assigned at birth and ensure that all facilities meet the needs of transgender people, including by providing medically necessary care, like transition-related surgeries, while incarcerated.\n\nFormer Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a reversal of the Obama administration\u2019s mixed-sex policy in 2018, determining that it would resume using \u201cbiological sex as the initial determination.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nCritics said Obama\u2019s transgender policy would have created huge risks of rape because few people who say they are transgender have undergone genital cosmetic surgery, and few can pass as members of the opposite sex. For example, Obama\u2019s policy would allow male criminals into women\u2019s prisons and pressure women-who-say-they-are-men to live in men\u2019s prisons. Sessions\u2019 new policy marks another step in reasserting the normal biology-based legal distinctions between female and male. Those distinctions were being scrubbed from the law by Obama\u2019s pro-transgender policies. Trump has already begun reversing Obama\u2019s pro-transgender policies in K-12 schools, in health care, and the military which now says it classifies soldiers\u2019 sex by using the \u201cbright line based on biological sex.\u201d\n\nWarren previewed her position in the criminal justice reform plan unveiled in August, which specifically called for \u201cspecial protections\u201d for LGBT individuals behind bars.\n\nThis is hardly the first time Warren has courted the transgender community. She applauded a child who claimed to be transgender during CNN\u2019s Equality Town Hall on Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure that the person I think is the right secretary of education meets you and hears your story, and then I want you to tell me if you think that\u2019s the right person and then we\u2019ll make the deal,\u201d Warren said.\n\nWarren also vowed to provide taxpayer-funded sex-reassignment surgery. She outlined that position in her comprehensive LGBT agenda, calling for \u201cgender-affirming\u201d health care.\n\n\u201cI believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care that they need, and that includes people who are transgender, who \u2014 it is the time for them to have gender-affirming surgery,\u201d Warren said during the town hall.\n\n\u201cI just think that\u2019s important and the appropriate medical care,\u201d she added.\n\nWarren, however, has not always felt that way. She said in 2012 that she did not find sexual reassignment surgery \u2013 for a transgender inmate, specifically \u2013 a \u201cgood use of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to say, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good use of taxpayer dollars,\u201d she said at the time, only to reverse her position years later.", "description": "Sen.
