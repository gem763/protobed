This month kicks off with three meteor showers. Accuweather\n\nStory Highlights The Draconids peak Tuesday night, while the Southern Taurids peak Wednesday night\n\nThe Draconids are best seen in the evening, instead of before dawn.\n\nThe Taurids are rich in fireballs and are often responsible for increased number of fireball reports.\n\nA skywatcher's doubleheader is on tap this week as a pair of meteor showers will peak on back-to-back nights.\n\nThe Draconids peak Tuesday night into Wednesday morning, and the Southern Taurids peak Wednesday night into Thursday morning.\n\nYou can expect to see up to 10 meteors an hour for each shower.\n\n\u201cThe Draconids meteor shower kicks off the fall meteor shower season,\u201d said Dave Samuhel, AccuWeather astronomy blogger and meteorologist.\n\nThough often a rather quiet shower, the Draconids did produce some awesome meteor displays in 1933 and 1946, EarthSky's Bruce McClure said, when thousands of meteors per hour were seen.\n\nMore recently, European observers saw more than 600 meteors per hour in 2011.\n\nThe Draconids are best seen in the evening, instead of before dawn, because the winged Dragon, the shower\u2019s radiant point in the constellation Drago, flies highest in the sky at nightfall, EarthSky said.\n\n\u201cThis is a good shower for younger stargazers, especially since the shower peaks on a school night,\u201d Samuhel said.\n\nUnfortunately, the moon will be in the sky during this part of the night, so stargazers should look for meteors in areas of the sky away from the bright moon, AccuWeather reported.\n\n2 meteor showers peak this week on back-to-back nights:\n\nTuesday night - Draconids\n\nWednesday night - Southern Taurids\n\nHere's the latest cloud cover forecast & viewing tips: https://t.co/J2a5KvOx9spic.twitter.com/ft0xTNQ5Fp \u2014 AccuWeatherAstronomy (@AccuAstronomy) October 7, 2019\n\nThe next night will be the peak of the Southern Taurids meteor shower, according to the American Meteor Society (AMS).\n\nThough best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere, the Taurids can be seen in the Northern Hemisphere, according to NASA meteor expert Bill Cooke.\n\nSimilar to the Draconids, the Southern Taurids are a minor shower with fewer than 10 meteors per hour, AccuWeather said, but don\u2019t let the slim numbers discourage you:\n\n\"The Taurids are rich in fireballs and are often responsible for increased number of fireball reports from September through November,\" the AMS said.\n\nFireballs are meteors that appear incredibly bright as they streak through the sky, according to AccuWeather. They can be so bright that they can cast shadows on the ground for several seconds.\n\nAlthough there aren't many of them, \"if you see a Taurid, it can be very brilliant, and it'll knock your eyes out,\" Cooke told Space.com. \"It's simply the fact that when a Taurid appears, it's usually big and bright.\"\n\nThis month, the Orionid meteor shower promises even more of a sky show. It will peak the night of Oct. 21-22.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/07/meteor-showers-draconids-and-southern-taurids-peak-week/3898296002/", "description": "A skywatcher's doubleheader is on tap this week as a pair of meteor showers will peak on back-to-back nights: The Draconids, the Southern Taurids.", "authors": ["Doyle Rice", "Published P.M.
