Sales have been underwhelming. The company continues to burn cash. And the NIO stock price has plunged, dropping 55% so far this year and declining 70%+ from early March highs. In today\u2019s trading alone, it\u2019s down 5.8% as of this writing.\n\nThe Nio Stock Price Should Be at an All-Time Low More\n\nSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe pressure has continued of late after a brief rally in July. But, to be blunt, it really should be worse. Bad news is mounting. Nio\u2019s very viability seems at risk in the near term. And there\u2019s an important question at the moment that hasn\u2019t been answered.\n\nNIO might seem cheap. The stock, as noted, has pulled back sharply. It trades below $3. As bulls are wont to argue, Nio is the \u201cTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of China\u201d \u2014 yet is valued at less than one-tenth its U.S. counterpart in terms of market cap.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut NIO isn\u2019t cheap. The market still values the company around $3 billion including net debt. There\u2019s little reason for even that valuation, particularly amid increasingly concerning news. This is a significantly challenged company in a hugely competitive market with macro worries layered on top. It can, and likely will, get worse for Nio.\n\nA Bad Month for Nio, and the NIO Stock Price\n\nSince August 2, the NIO stock price has fallen 17.4%. It\u2019s declined 32.5% from intraday highs on July 10. Again, it really should be worse.\n\nIndeed, the news surrounding the company over the past month or so has been dreadful. From a macro standpoint, there\u2019s been no progress on the trade war front. And the yuan was devalued in early August, making Nio\u2019s eventual profits (if they arrive) less valuable to U.S. investors. Chinese macro concerns remain, leading to volatility in even more established plays like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD).\n\nFrom a company-specific perspective, the news in August was even worse. July deliveries of just 837 vehicles disappointed. The \u2018retirement\u2018 of Nio\u2019s co-founder followed two other key executive exits the month before. A week later, the company announced it was laying off 1,200 employees \u2014 nearly 14% of its workforce.\n\nNone of those news items suggest a growth company, which Nio has to be. The NIO stock price, after all, is still ~2x revenue (again, including net debt). That might sound cheap \u2014 but for a sharply unprofitable automotive company that doesn\u2019t even manufacture its own vehicles, it\u2019s not.\n\nRather, this sounds like a company that needs to save cash, has serious strategic questions, and isn\u2019t selling nearly enough cars to come close to covering its expenses.\n\nThat in turn undercuts the argument that a trade war resolution somehow fixes Nio\u2019s problems. There are 486 electric vehicle manufacturers in China, as Bloomberg noted earlier this year. That\u2019s a competitive issue not a temporary geopolitical problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere Are Earnings?\n\nAfter all that bad news, there\u2019s one odd piece of \u2018no news\u2019 at the moment: Nio\u2019s second quarter earnings. Nio reports on a calendar basis. But more than two months after its quarter ended, the company still hasn\u2019t even announced an earnings release date.\n\nTo be sure, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything nefarious. Bitauto (NYSE:BITA), also founded by Nio co-founder Bin Li, isn\u2019t reporting until Thursday. But it does seem to suggest that at the least Nio doesn\u2019t have much good news to report. It may also be that the company is working toward something else \u2014 perhaps a financing \u2014 before the release.\n\nAgain, this is a company whose current burn rate suggests it may have less than a year\u2019s worth of cash remaining. That rate should moderate after the layoffs, to be sure. But any uncertainty for this kind of company seems like bad news. And it\u2019s possible, with more trade war drama over the Labor Day weekend, that the lack of an earnings release will lead to more questions \u2013 and more selling.", "description": "2019 has not been good to Nio (NYSE:NIO).
