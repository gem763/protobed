The next day, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nYemen\u2019s southern provinces have long been a stronghold for Islamist extremist groups, and the attacks might point to a growth in extremist presence as the United Arab Emirates takes a less overt role in the conflict.\n\nThe second attack, also on Aug. 1, came in the form of a missile strike that hit a military parade in the al-Jala camp near the Buraiqa district in Aden, claiming the lives of at least 30 Security Belt personnel and also killing Abu al-Yamama, the leading Yemeni counterterrorism commander of those forces.\n\nThe Iran-backed Shiite Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released by Brig. Gen. Yehya Sarea, a Houthi military spokesman. He boasted that \u201cthe joint operation against the al-Jala camp successfully targeted a military parade for the invaders and mercenaries [of Aden].\u201d\n\nHe cited the recent advancement of military positions in the provinces of al-Dhale and Taiz as cause for the attack.\n\nThe day after the two attacks, Yemeni security officials say, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula militants stormed al-Mahfad military camp in the governorate of Abyan, taking advantage of the chaos from the attacks in Aden the day before. The incident claimed the lives of at least 19 Security Belt Forces personnel in a foiled attempt to take control of the camp.\n\nThe Shabwani Elite\u2014a United Arab Emirates-backed paramilitary unit focused on counterterrorism operations\u2014reportedly helped assist Abyan security forces to retake the area after it was briefly captured.\n\nAl-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula subsequently claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe U.N. special envoy for Yemen released a statement Aug. 1 on Twitter claiming to be \u201cgravely concerned by the escalation of violence\u201d in Aden, but failing to condemn the attacks. There was no comment by the U.N. special envoy for Yemen about the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula attack in Abyan the following day.\n\nThe three attacks represent a real possibility of escalation in the south from both Houthi rebels and extremist groups, exposing the possible weakness of local security forces to attacks in the heart of the areas they control.\n\nBoth al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS may be testing the readiness of Security Belt Forces and other local security providers following the recent United Arab Emirates\u2019 drawdown of its military presence.\n\nHouthi fighters and extremist militants are likely to continue to strike security infrastructure in the south to further fragment the Saudi-led Arab military coalition and its allies.\n\nIf attacks continue on an upward trajectory, from either the Houthis or other Islamic extremists, the U.N. special envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, will face intense pressure from the international community to revive stalled peace talks and seek a viable peace settlement.", "description": "Two separate terrorist\u00a0attacks\u00a0earlier this month struck the Yemeni governorate of Aden, and those were followed by a third", "authors": ["Nicole Robinson", "Research Assistant", "The Allison Center For Foreign Policy", "Nicole Is A Research Assistant In The Allison Center For Foreign Policy At The Heritage Foundation."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-08/GettyImages-1158934409.jpg?itok=tdTsfqwk"}
