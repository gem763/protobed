At least, that was the case before the creation of the Federal Reserve. Nowadays, the Fed remains a potent political force of unelected bureaucrats, ready and willing to steer the economy in the direction they see fit. It\u2019s a potentially dangerous precedent to be sure, and Congress would be wise to contain it.\n\nOn September 25, 2019, the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs will hold a hearing on the topic of \u201cFacilitating Faster Payments in the U.S.\u201d It\u2019s a topic of fundamental importance in today\u2019s political landscape, determining whether the Fed can compete against the private sector. In early August, the Fed announced that it will establish its own real-time payment (RTP) system. Upon completion, the service\u2014called FedNow\u2014would allow banks in the United States the ability to offer instantaneous payment transfers between financial institutions.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly a big step\u2014 which our legislative bodies have a duty to vet thoroughly. In attendance at the Senate Committee meeting will be Esther L. George, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. She and the Fed will have the chance to demonstrate why they believe a federally-run RTP system is justified. But more than that, the hearing will be a fantastic opportunity for Congress to reclaim its authority over the Federal Reserve, ensuring that their RTP system meets the needs of consumers.\n\nBut how could the Senate rein in an independently-operating agency like the Federal Reserve? Through a law passed by the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee itself: The Monetary Control Act of 1980.\n\nAmong a myriad of other regulations, the Monetary Control Act placed a particularly relevant qualifier on the Federal Reserve\u2019s power when it comes to the issue of real-time payments. The law states that the Fed can itself intervene in America\u2019s payment system only if \u201cthe service is one that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide with reasonable effectiveness, scope, and equity.\u201d That\u2019s certainly a big \u201cif,\u201d especially considering that the private market for RTP systems is already thriving in the United States.\n\nIf under the Monetary Control Act, the Federal Reserve has indeed violated its mandate, it is incumbent upon the Senate to ensure that the Fed system will not create more problems than it will solve. But how would the Senate know if the Federal Reserve is misbehaving, and more importantly, what can be done to assure that the right protective measures are put in place?\n\nThe first question Congress needs to ask is whether the FedNow RTP system will be interoperable with the private sector. That is, will the Fed\u2019s real-time payment service work with preexisting, private RTP providers, or will the Fed\u2019s proposal effectively cannibalize the entire marketplace? Congress has a responsibility to make sure that the latter possibility never becomes a reality. Because, if it did, not only would wildly successful American enterprises be ruined, but consumer choice and connectivity would also suffer.\n\nAsking the Fed about implementing proper consumer protections needs to be a principal concern at the Senate hearing as well. Under the current RTP marketplace, Big Tech\u2019s instantaneous transfer systems, like Google Pay and Amazon Pay, are required to operate through a chartered bank. That is because chartered banks have safety and soundness regimes that protect consumer information. The regulations on these banks extend far beyond the requirements expected of Google, Amazon, and companies of similar profile under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Congress must ensure that the Fed\u2019s RTP system does not become a loophole for large corporations to skirt the law and get direct access to the Fed. Otherwise, a federally-run RTP system would only create the possibility and incentive for abuse and corruption.\n\n\n\nCommittee members should ask whether the Fed\u2019s system will treat all banks the same. Current private sector real-time payment systems are mandated to provide flat pricing to all banks for their services, regardless of how big they are. If FedNow does not have to follow these guidelines, it would put consumers who use small institutions at a disadvantage while giving the central bank-run system an unfair competitive edge over its private-sector competitors.\n\nChairman Mike Crapo and the rest of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs have not only the right, but the duty to hold the Federal Reserve\u2019s feet to the fire. By announcing its plans for FedNow, the Fed has seemingly ignored Congress\u2019 parameters for Fed intervention in the real-time payments business. The least the committee can do now is mandate the requirements of its new system, while threatening further action should it choose not to abide.\n\n\n\nAmerica\u2019s central bank may be independent, but it is not above the law. It\u2019s Congress\u2019 obligation to keep it that way.", "description": "The American experiment has always been based on a complicated .09/24/2019 11:13:30AM EST.", "authors": ["Peter Ferrara", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/213/bb9849ef-2d86-49f9-abdb-a708e9814847.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
