Photo: Paras Griffin/WireImage\n\nThe U.N. has called climate change the \u201cdefining issue of our time,\u201d one that requires \u201cunprecedented changes in all aspects of society.\u201d And yet the U.S. conversation on confronting the crisis has spent a disproportionate amount of time on \u2026 whether to ban plastic straws. So it was refreshing to see Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren refuse to engage with that question at all during a town hall earlier this week.\n\nDuring CNN\u2019s seven-hour climate town hall on Wednesday night, the ten candidates who will be participating in the upcoming Democratic debates used the stage to discuss a handful of climate-related issues, like the Paris climate accord and greenhouse gases. The moderators also touched on the nationwide effort to ban plastic straws \u2014 an admirable cause, to be sure, but one that distracts from the larger structural changes at issue. Some candidates, such as California senator Kamala Harris, responded enthusiastically, calling for a ban on plastic straws. But when moderator Chris Cuomo asked Warren about whether the government should regulate straws \u2014 as well as other products that have an environmental impact, like light bulbs \u2014 she did little to conceal her annoyance with the question.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry wants to keep us arguing about light bulbs and cheeseburgers while 70% of pollution comes from just three industries. We need to focus on creating big, structural change to tackle this climate crisis and the Washington corruption head-on. #ClimateTownHall pic.twitter.com/HwdYmcE6T0 \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 5, 2019\n\n\u201cOh, come on, give me a break,\u201d she said in what was one of the more electrifying moments of the town hall. Though she understands and admires consumers\u2019 efforts to \u201cfind the part that they can work on and what can they do,\u201d she said that putting the onus on the individual is inadequate.\n\n\u201cUnderstand, this is exactly what the fossil-fuel industry hopes we\u2019re all talking about,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy around your light bulbs, around your straws, and around your cheeseburgers, when 70 percent of the pollution, of the carbon that we\u2019re throwing into the air, comes from three industries.\u201d\n\nFew politicians have approached the issue of climate change with necessary urgency despite the cries of environmental activists around the world. Groups like Sunrise Movement and the People\u2019s Climate Movement have been fighting for the passage of the Green New Deal alongside progressive politicians like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and we\u2019ve watched the growth of an inspiring youth climate movement; meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee recently voted down holding a stand-alone climate debate.\n\nHowever, some presidential candidates, like Warren \u2014 as well as Vermont senator Bernie Sanders \u2014 have put forward progressive practices and policies demonstrating that they understand structural change is needed and it\u2019s needed now. In January, Warren became the first candidate to sign a pledge declaring that she would not take campaign donations from the fossil-fuel industry, and has factored the climate into many of her myriad proposals. Most recently, she embraced the ambitious climate platform of former presidential candidate Jay Inslee, who made the issue the cornerstone of his short campaign. Under Warren\u2019s $3 trillion plan, she would call for the U.S. to achieve 100 percent clean energy within the next ten years.\n\nShe knows we don\u2019t have time for relatively minor distractions.\n\nStay in touch.
