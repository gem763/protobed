The chamber voted 405 to 11 in support of the measure.\n\n\"The resolution which has apparently been drafted and issued for domestic consumption is devoid of any historical or legal basis,\" Turkey's foreign ministry said in a statement after the vote.\n\nMore:\n\n\"The resolution itself is also not legally binding,\" the statement said.\n\n\"As a meaningless political step, its sole addressees are the Armenian lobby and anti Turkey groups ... The debate on the events that occurred in 1915 belongs to the realm of history, not politics.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Turkey summoned the US ambassador to the country over the resolution.\n\n'Great atrocities'\n\nUS politicians delivered a two-punch rebuke to Turkey on its national day, with the genocide measure passing alongside a bill that imposes sanctions over Ankara's assault on Kurdish-controlled territory in northeastern Syria, which was made possible by the withdrawal of American troops.\n\n191012104551443\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was honoured to join her colleagues \"in solemn remembrance of one of the great atrocities of the 20th century: the systematic murder of more than 1.5 million Armenian men, women and children by the Ottoman Empire\".\n\nPrevious efforts to pass similar legislation failed because of Turkish diplomatic opposition.\n\nAlthough Turkey accepts that many Armenians died in ethnic fighting and deportations between 1915-17 during World War I, it has rejected the label of genocide.\n\nTurkey says both Armenians and Turks died as a result of World War I, but contests the figures, putting the death toll in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu condemned Tuesday's vote, saying it was \"null and void\".\n\n\"Those whose projects were frustrated turn to antiquated resolutions. Circles believing that they will take revenge this way are mistaken.
