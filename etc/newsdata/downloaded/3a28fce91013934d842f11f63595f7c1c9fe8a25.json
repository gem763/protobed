Overall, these series received a combined 47 nominations.\n\nAmazon Original's Emmy Award-winning-and-nominated TV shows such as \" The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" and \" Fleabag\" and critically acclaimed movies like the \"The Big Sick\"' and \" Manchester by the Sea\" can be watched exclusively on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nIn addition to their standout shows and movies, Prime Video has an extensive library of thousands of other titles, which are included with the cost of membership. They also offer programming that you can rent or purchase for a small fee. Access to all titles, however, comes at a cost depending on who you are and whether or not you choose to pay monthly or annually.\n\nTo simplify the options, we've broken down plan eligibility and pricing here.\n\nAmazon Prime membership\n\nThe most cost-effective way to access videos on Amazon Prime is by being, or becoming, an Amazon Prime member. Amazon Prime Video is included with an Amazon Prime membership.\n\nIf you're not already a Prime member but would like to be, you can start with a free 30-day trial before deciding whether or not you would like to continue your subscription. Memberships cost $12.99 per month or $119 per year if you choose to pay annually (you save $36.88). EBT or Medicaid card holders are eligible to receive Amazon Prime benefits at a discounted rate of $5.99 monthly for up to four years.\n\nRead more: 31 useful Amazon Prime benefits to know that go beyond free 2-day shipping \u2014 like access to Prime Day deals\n\nAmazon Prime Student membership\n\nAmazon Prime Student gives you all the same benefits of Amazon Prime at half the cost.

To become a Prime Video member, first-time Amazon users can access the Amazon Prime membership information page, navigate to \"See more plans\" and select \"Prime Video\" when given options for Amazon Prime plans.\n\nPrime Channel subscriptions\n\nAccess to shows on a number of popular channels is not included in the Amazon Prime or Prime Video fee. A majority of the channel subscriptions offer a free seven-day trial, but after that first week, you have to pay an additional amount per month. See below for a breakdown of subscription costs for some popular channels.\n\nAlyssa Powell/Business Insider\n\nNo membership\n\nIf you don't want to pay for any kind of membership, simply log in to your Amazon account and pay for your individual purchase or rental.
