That\u2019s really a function of that real versus nominal wages.\u201d\n\nPayscale\u2019s Q3 index showed a nominal wage increase of 0.5% quarter over quarter, or 2.6% year over year. The most substantial areas of wage growth were recorded in areas with a strong tech industry.\n\nIt should then come as no surprise then that the San Francisco metro area was once again No. 1 for annual wage growth. The Golden City had a year-over-year increase of 4.3%. Seattle and Austin metro areas were not far behind, each with an annual growth of 4%.\n\nGraphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nOne standout metro area, according to Payscale, was Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. Wage growth in that area came in at 3.7%, the fourth-highest in the nation. What made that growth even more surprising is that Pittsburgh has had 3 quarters of lackluster growth, according to Payscale data.\n\nWage growth in the oil-rich Houston Metro area is currently the slowest in the nation. Sampath tells Yahoo Finance that this is most likely due to fluctuations in the energy industry, as well as the fact that it is an area that is prone to natural disasters.\n\nOn the occupation side of the index jobs report, it\u2019s a two-horse race between transportation and information technology. Transportation saw the highest annual wage growth, at 4.9%, while IT came in second at 3.2%. Sampath explained these industries often complement one another.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing effects of lagging impact of consumer spending on the economy, [and] that is creating sort of a spiky wage world,\u201d he said. Some occupations are flourishing, and some occupations are not. \u201cA software engineer is paid a ton of money, and they have a demand for Amazon Prime next day delivery. That demand has an impact on the transportation sector. You\u2019re gonna have to pay someone to get it to the warehouse or get it to the store and get it to deliver to in software engineer.\u201d\n\nReggie Wade is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
