She has since had 10 brain surgeries and had to learn how to walk again.\n\nThen-14, Deserae was lured into a creek by two of her classmates - Colter D. Peterson and Jayzon Decker, 17 - who plotted to kill her for 'being annoying' when she started contacting Peterson 'too often' on Snapchat.\n\nShe was shot once in the back of the head, and left for dead at the creek in Smithfield, about 90 miles north of Salt Lake City.\n\nIn 2018, the teenagers were sentenced to 15 years to life in prison.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nMore than two years after two classmates shot her in the head and left her for dead, Deserae Turner (right), 17, was escorted onto her high school field in Utah by her father, Matt (left), just moments after she was crowned homecoming queen\n\nThe 17-year-old donned a silver knee-length dress with a royal blue bolero to cover her arms as she flashed a huge smile. Deserae was then joined by Case Gehring (left), who was elected as the school's homecoming king\n\nAt 14 years old Deserae (pictured after the shooting) was shot in the back of the head and left in a ditch in February 2017\n\nThe teenagers who shot Deserae were charged with attempted murder, aggravated robbery and obstructing justice.\n\nAt the time, police said that Peterson had complained to Decker that the teenage girl had been texting and Snapchatting him too frequently.\n\nDecker then responded: 'It would be pretty easy to get rid of her.'\n\nThey originally intended to slit Deserae's throat and let her bleed out in the rural area. However, the boys decided it would be quieter to just shoot her.\n\nWhile playing video games, the boys concocted their plan to lure Turner to an isolated dry canal bed behind a high school in Smithfield.\n\nThey then shot her and left her for dead in a ditch, prosecutors said.\n\nDecker kept the spent shell casing 'as a memento,' charges said. Officers later found it displayed on his bedroom windowsill.\n\nAfter the premeditated shooting, the boys stole her backpack with her cellphone and iPod.\n\nWhen Deserae failed to return home from school that day, her parents reported her missing. An overnight search party was launched and Turner was found lying in the dry creek bed with a bullet wound to her head.\n\nDeserae was elected queen of her high school by nearly 1,400 students. Photos of Deserae smiling with her date, Logan Matz (left), were shared on the Facebook page, Praying for Deserae Turner. She was also seen sharing a dance with the homecoming king (right)\n\n'It was a lot, but it was so worth it,' Deserae (pictured on stage) said. 'I truly wish every one of us high school girls would be able to experience such a magical night'\n\nAt the sentencing for the two teenage boys, Deserae told a judge she considered Peterson a friend before the shooting, when she did karate, rode horses and played the saxophone.\n\nShe struggled to walk, dress herself and function through seizures and debilitating headaches.\n\n'There are times I wish I could give the gun back to Colter and tell him to try again and put me out of my misery,' Deserae said at the sentencing.\n\nShe has had more than 10 operations since the shooting, and requires another two more.\n\nDeserae also struggles to concentrate, and is only able to attend school part time, for three hours a day. She also does online classes.\n\nDeserae had no idea nearly 1,400 students had voted her as homecoming queen until she was crowned, she said.\n\nAfter the exhilarating evening, she got dressed up and put on her crown for a series of events last week, fitting in some naps in between to conserve her energy.\n\n'It was a lot, but it was so worth it,' Deserae said. 'I truly wish every one of us high school girls would be able to experience such a magical night.'\n\nPhotos of Deserae smiling with her date, Logan Matz, were also shared on the Facebook page, Praying for Deserae Turner.\n\n'Homecoming Dance. Des's date is Logan Matz. They met at a 4H State Contest a couple summers ago. Favorite things for these two friends are movie nights and laughing together,' the post reads.\n\nOther photos also showed Deserae during the royalty dance with Gehring.\n\n'I'm pretty sure it's a night she will always remember,' the post reads.\n\nDeserae's injuries have prevented her from going to school full time, so she attends three hours a day and takes online classes.\n\nShe's still on track to graduate with her classmates.\n\n'It is definitely hard. There are times when I just want to go out and ride (horses),' Deserae said.\n\n'I just want to be normal again. I just want to be me. But this is me now, and I just have to embrace it.'\n\nDeserae's (left, in April 2017 and right, before the shooting) injuries have prevented her from going to school full time, so she attends for three hours a day and takes online classes\n\nAfter 10 brain surgeries, Turner has defied doctors' expectations. She has two more surgeries this year\n\nJayzon Decker (left), 17, plotted with friend Colter Peterson (right) to lure Turner to a dry canal bed in February last year before shooting her in the head and leaving her for dead\n\nAfter 10 brain surgeries, Turner has defied doctors' expectations, down to her ability to walk down a flight of stairs at the homecoming assembly and step onto the dance floor with the king.\n\n'She had to relearn everything,' said her mother, April Turner. 'She is the most determined person I have ever known, and I saw it in her even as a toddler.'", "description": "More than two years after two classmates shot her in the head and left her for dead, Deserae Turner, 17, walked onto her high school field in Utah right after she was crowned homecoming queen.", "authors": ["Valerie Edwards For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/18/19407686-0-image-a-38_1570470894850.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
