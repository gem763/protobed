This number marks an increase of roughly 80,000 case completions from fiscal year 2018 (FY18), the same year that EOIR established case completion goals for immigration judges in response to years of declining or stagnant productivity. The FY19 numbers are nearly double the number of completed cases from just three years ago,\" DOJ released in a statement.\n\nOver the past two years, President Trump ordered the hiring of additional immigration court judges along the southern border with Mexico. The additional resources were provided as hundreds-of-thousands of Central Americans entered the United States, with most falsely claiming asylum.\n\n\"Our immigration courts are doing everything in their power to efficiently adjudicate immigration cases while respecting due process rights, but efficient adjudication alone cannot resolve the crisis at the border,\u201d EOIR Director James McHenry said in a statement. \u201cWhile EOIR is doing an unprecedented job adjudicating cases fairly and expeditiously, the nearly one million case backlog will continue to grow unless Congress acts to address the crisis at the border.\u201d\n\nNew illegal crossing numbers were also released this week and have declined for the fourth month in a row.\n\nSept. marked the lowest number of law enforcement actions in FY19\u2014the 4th month of a steady decline. This is an unprecedented achievement & it\u2019s due to @POTUS\u2019 work with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries to join as true partners to address this as a regional crisis. pic.twitter.com/cK15Sr1kK1 \u2014 Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan (@CBPMarkMorgan) October 8, 2019\n\nIllegal crossings at our southwest border have now declined for 4 months straight.\n\n\n\nIt's directly due to President @realDonaldTrump's work with our partners in Mexico and the Northern Triangle. pic.twitter.com/Oq3reXnzmt \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) October 8, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, construction on the border wall continues.", "description": ".10/11/2019 15:43:27PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/townhall/reu/o/2018/330/6ed23a99-4f0c-492b-9cb1-a8eac0336d5f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
