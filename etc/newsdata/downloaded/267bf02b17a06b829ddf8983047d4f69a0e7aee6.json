It means sooner or later, we will be killing each other over water here.\u201d\n\nGuzu says the community is facing the worst water crisis in years because of the drought plaguing the province.\n\nThe department of water and sanitation has since encouraged Eastern Cape municipalities to impose water restrictions as dam levels continue to plummet in most of the province.\n\nRead: Municipal census reveals severe lack of service delivery\n\nGuzu, who depends on social grants from two of her children and on odd jobs to get by, says she managed to save enough money to buy a 2 500-litre water tank for rain harvesting a few years ago.\n\nBut then, she adds, the situation worsened.\n\nIt got so bad that if it rained and she managed to hold some of that water in her tank, the water would be stolen overnight.\n\nThe 55-year-old mother of four says she and her community are now forced to drink water with animals from rivers.\n\n\u201cWe drink the same water where pigs swim and where cows and sheep drink. We are in trouble. There are taps here in the village, but there is no water coming out. Sometimes water will come out from the taps for an hour. If you are not in town when that happens, you will miss out.\n\n\u201cIt is very painful. We can survive without electricity, but without water we are dead. The water from the river is contaminated and is not good for human consumption, but we are left with no choice but to drink there because of the water crisis we are facing. Government should intervene before there is an outbreak of diseases,\u201d says Guzu.\n\nButterworth is a town under the Amathole District Municipality, which is one of the province\u2019s water-scarce areas.\n\nGuzu says the community has resorted to buying water from trucks that retrieve it from the river and sell it to desperate villagers.\n\n\u201cThe river is very far and we cannot afford to go there every day. So, there is a truck that goes to the river to fetch water and we buy it from there,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nNomelikhaya Siphukuza (58) from KwaMlise village, also in Butterworth, says her community has to fetch water from Bawa River, far from home.\n\nSiphukuza says she spends about R600 a month to fill her 500-litre water tank.\n\n\u201cThe water is not even clean. We have to boil it before we drink. We also use the same water to cook, do laundry and bath. Hence, it does not even last a month.\u201d\n\nFor Mziwabantu Lusithi (59) and his community in Thanga Village, near Butterworth, it has been three years since they last saw water running out of their taps.\n\nCarrying a 10-litre container of water he has just bought in town in Butterworth, Lusithi says: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have money to buy at least drinking water, you are forced to go and drink with cattle at the river. This bottle, which I bought for R10, will last us for about a week because we only use it for drinking.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the week, the department of water and sanitation released its weekly drought status report, indicating water storage levels across the country.\n\nThe reservoir update showed that dam levels were \u201cstruggling a lot\u201d in the Eastern Cape \u2013 down to 56.2% last week, compared with 56.4% the week before.\n\nThe department reported that the Amathole district, which supplies water to Butterworth, was suffering from severe drought and its dams were at \u201ca critical stage\u201d.\n\nBut, as is always the case, some people have turned the drought into a business opportunity.\n\nSonwabo Mlungu and Ziphozakhe Dyani, who are co-owners of Reverse Osmosis Water Systems, are profiting from the situation by selling purified water in Butterworth and surrounding towns.\n\nTheir shop in Butterworth is a hive of activity as residents carrying containers to refill with water frequent it daily.\n\nMlungu says he sells more than 15 000 litres of water a day at R1 a litre, thanks to the high demand for water in the area.\n\n\n\nHe and Dyani started their business in 2017, after realising that there was a lack of water \u2013 and that even when there was water, it was unfit for consumption.\n\n\u201cI am pumping 15 000 litres of water as we speak. We started in 2017 and have been assisting Butterworth with conservation, water harvesting and teaching people about water awareness. We have worked very closely with the Mnquma Local Municipality.\n\n\u201cWe are also providing people with filters, which we have at the shop, so they can install them in their tanks at home. We do not only sell water but also bring solutions to the water problems people have.\n\n\u201cWe heard that from September 1, taps will be dry because there is generally no water. Levels of water at Gcuwa Dam are very low at the moment,\u201d said Mlungu.\n\nLast week, City Press visited Gcuwa Dam, the main water source for Butterworth and surrounding areas. Water levels were clearly down.\n\nThe dam was standing at 35.7% last week, compared with 39.6% the previous week.\n\nThe situation was also depressing in other areas around the province.", "description": "Residents are growing desperate in the drought-stricken Eastern Cape.", "authors": ["Lubabalo Ngcukana"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9302/474e102c509e4aa683ac86b5e037fe48.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
