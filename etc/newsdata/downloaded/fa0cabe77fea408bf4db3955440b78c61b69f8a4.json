GDP growth drops to 1.9% in Q3 as consumers retreat", "language": "en", "text": "The economy seems to be losing some overall steam in today\u2019s advance estimate of economic growth for the third quarter, but the real problems might be in the details. The gross domestic product grew at only a 1.9% annualized rate, the third time in the last four quarters that it hit at or below 2.0%. That portends potential issues in Donald Trump\u2019s re-election:\n\nReal gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the third quarter of 2019 (table 1), according to the \u201cadvance\u201d estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the second quarter, real GDP increased 2.0 percent. The GDP estimate released today is based on source data that are incomplete or subject to further revision by the source agency (see \u201cSource Data for the Advance Estimate\u201d on page 2). The \u201csecond\u201d estimate for the third quarter, based on more complete data, will be released on November 27, 2019. \u2026 The deceleration in real GDP in the third quarter reflected decelerations in PCE, federal government spending, and state and local government spending, and a larger decrease in nonresidential fixed investment. These movements were partly offset by a smaller decrease in private inventory investment, and upturns in exports and in residential fixed investment.\n\nTwo numbers jump out from the tables in this report \u2014 personal consumption expenditures (PCEs) and gross private domestic investment. The first number, which coverall all consumer spending, dropped sharply from the previous quarter from 4.6% increase to 2.9%. That\u2019s still above the two quarters previous, but it\u2019s a signal that Q2\u2019s big boost may not last. It\u2019s not a bad number \u2014 objectively speaking, it\u2019s pretty good \u2014 but it\u2019s slightly below 2018\u2019s 3.0% annual growth in PCEs, and the direction is certainly not what the Trump administration wants to see.\n\nThe numbers for private domestic investment are objectively poor, however, and especially since Q2 showed a contraction of 6.2% already. This quarter isn\u2019t quite as bad at -1.5%, and both residential structures (5.1%) and intellectual property (6.6%) grew at a decent clip; it was the first growth in residential property in almost eight quarters. However, business investment in structures (-15.3%) and equipment (-3.8%) show a lack of confidence in the economy, especially the former, which also declined -11.1% in Q2.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal notes both trends in its analysis, while also pointing out that economists expected it to be a little worse overall:\n\nEconomists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 1.6% growth reading for the third quarter. The stronger-than-expected growth rate was boosted by government and consumer spending, residential investment and exports. That was partly offset by an drop in business investment. The report showed the divergence between relatively solid consumer spending and falling business investment continued from the second quarter into the third, as the long-simmering trade war with China escalated.\n\nTo the political point, CNN points out that these numbers look an awful lot like GDP reports in the Obama administration. The Fed will likely make a cut to interest rates, they point out, but White House trade adviser Peter Navarro blames the Fed for losing a full point off of these GDP reports:\n\nThe US economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.9% in the third quarter, the Commerce Department announced Wednesday. https://t.co/aoGP9iEc0X pic.twitter.com/6aHEN7imcH \u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 30, 2019\n\nThere may be a lot of things the economy needs, but a permanent quantitative easing is almost certainly not among them. Ending the trade war would provide a much more salutary and long-lasting benefit, at least if it concludes with real reforms to China\u2019s business practices, and there is still areas of deregulation which the Trump administration could make improvements \u2026 if it can work with Congress, which seems hopeless for the moment.\n\nBarring either of those, Trump may limp into the next election cycle with an impeachment on his back and Obama-esque growth numbers to defend. That\u2019s not going to suffice for incentivizing working-class turnout, especially if wage growth continues to stall as it did in September. The next jobs report will come out on Friday, and the White House had better hope that it shows a spark of real life.", "description": "Blame the Fed?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TrumpShrug.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
