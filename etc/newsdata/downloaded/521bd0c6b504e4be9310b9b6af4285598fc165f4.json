The Eagles have now scored on their first four. The 10-point home favorites took a 12-point lead on Jake Elliott\u2019s 22-yard field goal with 3:10 remaining. The 18-play scoring drive, which saw Carson Wentz go over 300 yards passing and the Eagles convert four third downs, took nearly nine minutes off the clock. (Eagles 32, Redskins 20, 3:10 4th Quarter)\n\nEagles extend lead on Alshon Jeffery\u2019s short touchdown: Philadelphia outgained Washington 197 yards to 6 in the third quarter and opened the fourth quarter with a two-yard touchdown run by Alshon Jeffery. The wide receiver\u2019s second touchdown of the game, which came on a pass thrown behind the line of scrimmage, capped a nine-play, 71-yard drive against a Redskins defense that looks gassed after a dominating start. Darren Sproles spun his way into the end zone on the ensuing two-point conversion to give the Eagles a two-score lead. (Eagles 29, Redskins 20, 14:55 4th Quarter)\n\n3rd Quarter\n\nDeSean Jackson beats Redskins deep again: After a slow start, the Eagles\u2019 offense is rolling. Of course, it helps when Carson Wentz can just chuck the ball deep down field and have DeSean Jackson run under it, as the speedy wide receiver has done twice already. Jackson\u2019s 53-yard touchdown catch gave him six catches for 126 yards in the game. It also gave the Eagles their first lead of the afternoon.

While Case Keenum and the passing game have thrived, Derrius Guice hasn\u2019t found much running room in his first game. Guice has nine carries for 16 yards after getting dropped by Fletcher Cox for a loss of five on Washington\u2019s first drive of the second half. (Redskins 20, Eagles 14, 5:22 3rd Quarter)\n\nEagles open the second half with a touchdown: Philadelphia appeared poised to go three-and-out on its first possession of the second half, but Eagles Coach Doug Pederson, never one to be conservative, kept his offense on the field on fourth and short from the Philadelphia 34-yard line. Carson Wentz picked up the first down on a quarterback sneak and, eight plays later, scrambled before finding Alshon Jeffery in the back of the end zone for a five-yard touchdown pass. Running backs Darren Sproles and Miles Sanders combined for 51 yards rushing on the drive and Wentz took advantage of Jeffery\u2019s favorable matchup with linebacker Jon Bostic to pull Philadelphia within six points. Defensive lineman Jonathan Allen has yet to return to the game for Washington.

Hopkins\u2019s second field goal of the afternoon capped a nine-play drive in the final two minutes after the Redskins\u2019 defense forced a three-and-out. The big play on the drive was a leaping 22-yard catch by Terry McLaurin along the right sideline over Eagles cornerback Ronald Darby. The rookie wide receiver has looked impressive, with three catches for 104 yards and a touchdown. (Redskins 20, Eagles 7, Halftime)\n\nDeSean Jackson puts the Eagles on the board: The Redskins will not earn their first shutout since Sept. 30, 1991, when they blanked the Eagles at home, not after Carson Wentz hooked up with DeSean Jackson for a 51-yard touchdown on third-and-10 late in the second quarter. Jackson, who routinely burned the Redskins for big plays during his first stint with Philadelphia, managed to get behind Josh Norman on the play. (Redskins 17, Eagles 7, 4:27 2nd Quarter)\n\nWashington punts for the first time: The Redskins and their juggernaut of an offense finally stalled on their fourth drive, resulting in Tress Way\u2019s first punt of the season. The result was a 57-yard boot returned by Darren Sproles for 12 yards. Washington\u2019s defense doesn\u2019t have a sack thus far, but Greg Manusky\u2019s unit has limited the Eagles to 67 total yards. (Redskins 17, Eagles 0, 5:47)\n\nRedskins extend lead on Terry McLaurin touchdown catch: The boo birds were out in Philadelphia, only five minutes into the second quarter, after Case Keenum found rookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin for a 70-yard touchdown. McLaurin, who had 11 touchdowns on only 35 catches as a senior at Ohio State, burned Eagles cornerback Rasul Douglas on the play. Keenum is now 10 for 12 for 202 yards and a pair of touchdowns. (Redskins 17, Eagles 0, 9:57 2nd Quarter)\n\nFourth-down stop keeps Philadelphia scoreless: The Eagles moved the ball on their second drive, but they came empty-handed when, on fourth-and-two from the Washington 29-yard line, Daron Payne batted down Carson Wentz\u2019s pass at the line of scrimmage. Wentz is 7 for 10, but he\u2019s only thrown for 36 yards. (Redskins 10, Eagles 0, 10:49 2nd Quarter)\n\nJonathan Allen is questionable to return: The Redskins dominated the first quarter, outgaining the Eagles 147-28 and controlling the ball for 10 minutes, but defensive lineman Jonathan Allen was being looked at by trainers on the sideline late in the quarter and is questionable to return with a left knee injury. (Redskins 10, Eagles 0, Start of 2nd Quarter)\n\n1st Quarter\n\nRedskins add to their lead with Dustin Hopkins field goal: Case Keenum is on fire to start the 2019 season. The veteran quarterback completed his first six passes and is 9 for 11 for 132 yards and completions to seven different receivers in the first quarter. Washington\u2019s second drive, an 11-play, 57-yard march that culminated in a 41-yard field goal by Dustin Hopkins, featured the first career catches by rookie wide receivers Kelvin Harmon (21 yards) and Terry McLaurin (13 yards). Washington is 3 for 4 on third down to start the game after going 9 for 42 on third down in their previous four games against Philadelphia, all of them losses. (Redskins 10, Eagles 0, 2:48 1st Quarter)\n\nWashington\u2019s defense gets a stop: The Eagles picked up one first down on their opening drive, on an 11-yard catch by DeSean Jackson. The former Redskins wide receiver, back with the team that drafted him after an offseason trade with Tampa Bay, doomed Philadelphia\u2019s drive two plays later when he was flagged for unnecessary roughness for mixing it up with Redskins cornerback Quinton Dunbar after the whistle. Carson Wentz threw too high for Nelson Agholor on third-and-long and the Eagles were forced to punt. (Redskins 7, Eagles 0, 8:59 1st Quarter)\n\nRedskins take early lead on long Vernon Davis touchdown catch: The Eagles won the toss and elected to defer, giving the Redskins the ball first. Washington\u2019s opening drive couldn\u2019t have gone much better for the visitors. Derrius Guice carried three times for nine yards and had a catch for eight yards over the middle. On third-and-two from the Eagles 48-yard line, Case Keenum found tight end Vernon Davis in the flat. The 35-year-old Davis, starting in place of the injured Jordan Reed, hurdled Ronald Darby and broke a tackle by Andrew Sendejo on his way to the end zone. Keenum was 4 for 4 for 71 yards on Washington\u2019s six-play, 80-yard touchdown drive.
