That\u2019s what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said at a rally in Minneapolis Thursday night. \u201cWe will never let it happen. We will defeat them.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s effort to create confusion and raise doubts about facts surrounding the whistleblower complaint and House Democrats\u2019 effort to remove him from office has been joined by several congressional Republicans and Trump associates.\n\nAfter Trump said last week that along with Ukraine, China should investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter over the younger Biden\u2019s business dealings, several Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), said the president was joking.\n\nAD\n\nThis week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) took the defense of Trump\u2019s controversial comment a step further. \u201cYou watch what the president said: He\u2019s not saying, \u2018China, investigate,\u2019 \u201d he said during an interview on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d Monday. What Trump told reporters regarding China was: \u201cThey should investigate the Bidens.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is deeply involved in the controversy over the administration\u2019s policies toward Ukraine, has often resorted to exaggeration when defending the president or condemning Democrats.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, this Congress has run roughshod over the right to call witnesses, the right to confront the witnesses against you, the right of counsel,\u201d he said Tuesday night on Laura Ingraham\u2019s Fox News show. \u201cI mean, they are threatening to imprison Attorney General [William] Barr and to impeach me. Well, that\u2019s his government lawyer and his private lawyer.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this year, some liberal activists floated the idea that Democrats could use the power of \u201cinherent contempt\u201d and have the House sergeant-at-arms arrest Barr when he was resisting congressional subpoenas related to former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation, but no Democratic leaders suggested going that route back then or now as part of the impeachment inquiry. It\u2019s unclear what Giuliani meant about being impeached since he is not a government official.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Trump has long been accused of spreading falsehoods or distorting the truth to defend of promote himself, observers said this behavior has been amplified in recent weeks as the impeachment inquiry moves forward.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two pretty simple lenses that explain his motivation around most things and it\u2019s either self-aggrandizement or self-preservation,\u201d Timothy O\u2019Brien, a Trump biographer and critic, said of the president. \u201cOn a day-to-day basis \u2014 when he\u2019s holding a press conference or dealing with an impeachment inquiry \u2014 he\u2019s doing it as performance artist who says whatever he thinks he needs to say in the moment to make whatever point he wants to make, however untethered it is from the fact pattern or reality.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s mischaracterizations threaten to overshadow political and tactical arguments that could potentially put Democrats on the defensive and help his case, such as the White House\u2019s view that a formal vote to launch an impeachment inquiry is necessary for it be considered valid. But the president has shown no signs of letting up.\n\nAD\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s go-to retorts in recent days is calling for the impeachment of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), one of three House chairmen overseeing the investigations that are serving as the foundation for the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cHe should be Impeached for Fraud!,\u201d Trump said Wednesday morning in a retweet of a congressional GOP ally announcing that he supported censuring Schiff. Trump has railed against Schiff for how the chairman characterized the president\u2019s phone call with the leader of Ukraine during a hearing, saying he put words in the president\u2019s mouth while suggesting he was reading directly from the rough transcript of the conversation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe defrauded the American public,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.\n\nSchiff hasn\u2019t been alone in facing Trump\u2019s impeachment wrath. Over the weekend, after Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) issued one of the most pointed GOP criticisms of Trump, the president responded with scathing tweet replete with a hashtag: \u201c#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNo matter that criticism of a president is not usually seen as a reason to remove a lawmaker from office or that it\u2019s long been a matter of practice that members of the House and Senate cannot get impeached. When then-Sen. William Blount of North Carolina was impeached by the House in 1787, the Senate decided in 1799 that Blount was not a \u201ccivil officer\u201d under the Constitution and thus could not face impeachment \u2014 a principle that has held up since.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear in the Constitution that the framers authorized the House and Senate to police its own members through the power to expel them,\u201d said Sarah Binder, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution and a congressional expert.\n\nGiuliani has also focused heavily on Schiff, and in a Fox News interview this week, he tried to bolster his case for suing the Intelligence Committee chairman, insisting that the \u201cspeech or debate\u201d clause of the Constitution \u2014 which is meant to protect lawmakers from liability as they go about their congressional duties \u2014 \u201conly protects him in that little chamber.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe problem for Giuliani: That\u2019s not accurate. A 2017 Congressional Research Service report notes that \u201cdespite the literal text, protected acts under the clause extend beyond \u2018speeches\u2019 or \u2018debates\u2019 under taken by members of Congress, and have also been interpreted to include all \u2018legislative acts\u2019 undertaken by members or aides.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSuch protected acts include introducing bills, speaking during committee hearings and leading congressional investigations, according to the CRS.\n\nThe White House counsel\u2019s letter that serves as Trump\u2019s main argument for resisting the investigatory demands of the House also makes a number of flawed, equivocal and potentially deceptive arguments, according to legal experts.\n\n\u201cThe main confusion of the letter is that it\u2019s arguing that the president is entitled essentially to hold the rights and procedural protections that he would receive in a criminal proceeding in a court,\u201d said Gregg Nunziata, who served in senior counsel roles for Sens. Rubio and John Thune (R-S.D.) as well as Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInvestigations led by Congress, Nunziata said, \u201care just a different context. They have different roles and different procedures and different rights.\u201d\n\nEven if it were fair to compare the House impeachment proceedings to a criminal process as White House counsel Pat Cipollone did, legal experts say the administration is wrong to insist on a litany of due process rights \u2014 such as the ability to cross-examine witnesses \u2014 for Trump at this point.\n\nThat\u2019s because the impeachment process most closely resembles the grand jury stage, while the rights that the White House is demanding for Trump would come in a trial, which would only occur if the House votes to impeach Trump and the Senate launches a trial to decide whether to convict the president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a political argument that I don\u2019t find particularly persuasive,\u201d said Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, of the White House letter. \u201cBut I think it obscures a lot of things or creates impressions that I don\u2019t think are warranted.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump himself has also repeatedly misled on the details of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u2014 saying the facts laid out by the person \u201chave been so incorrect\u201d and \u201cvery inaccurate.\u201d\n\nHe is repeatedly making that claim, even though much of the information has been corroborated, notably by the White House\u2019s own rough transcript of the July 25 phone call between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, that has been at the center of the impeachment imbroglio.\n\nAmong the assertions from the whistleblower that have later proved accurate: that Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cinitiate or continue an investigation\u201d into former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 rival; that Trump told Zelensky to speak with Giuliani and Barr about the matter, and that Trump raised the debunked theory that Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server may be in Ukraine, during the conversation.", "description": "Trump\u2019s effort to create confusion and raise doubts about facts surrounding the whistleblower complaint and House Democrats\u2019 effort to remove him from office, has been joined by several congressional Republicans and Trump associates.", "authors": ["Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yTgkOQzn-VaZyZ2FvUUYeQI5vmE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7GLVRMXKCUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
