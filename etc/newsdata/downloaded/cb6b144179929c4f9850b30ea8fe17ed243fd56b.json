Everyone should take part in finding a solution,' added Nasrallah, whose Iranian-backed Shi'ite group is Lebanon's most influential.\n\nThe protests that swept villages and towns across the country on Friday recalled the 2011 Arab revolts that toppled four presidents.

'But we are against clashes with the army or security forces and vandalism.'\n\nIn the speech, Nasarallah predicted that imposing more taxes would lead to an 'explosion' of unrest.\n\nHe said Lebanon was facing two big dangers - financial and economic meltdown and popular unrest.\n\n'If we don't work towards a solution we're heading towards a collapse of the country, it will be bankrupt and our currency will not have any value.'\n\n'The second danger is a popular explosion as a result of wrong handling of the situation,' Nasrallah said.\n\nThe protests that swept villages and towns across the country on Friday recalled the 2011 Arab revolts that toppled four presidents\n\nLebanese from all sects and walks of life waved banners and chanted for Hariri's government to go\n\nA Lebanese woman passes with her daughter over scattered glass in Beirut\n\nThe unusually wide geographic reach of protests has highlighted the deepening anger of the Lebanese. The government, which includes nearly all Lebanon's main parties, has repeatedly failed to implement reforms needed to fix the national finances.\n\n'The protests must continue because this is a matter of our dignity. We'll be left humiliated otherwise,' said Miriam Keserwan, 28.\n\nRiot police in vehicles and on foot rounded up protesters late on Friday, firing rubber bullets and tear gas canisters to disperse riots in Beirut that grew violent as the night wore on, leaving streets strewn with glass and burning debris.\n\nLebanon's internal security apparatus said 52 police were injured on Friday and its forces arrested 70 people.\n\n'I can't blame the people who are doing this,' said 26-year-old Charbel Abyad, referring to the city's damage. 'Some have no jobs, no healthcare and no education. They are being mistreated and they can't help but express it this way.'", "description": "Small groups of demonstrators gathered in Beirut in an effort to keep the protests going, with storefronts of banks and upmarket retailers in the capital's commercial district smashed in.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/13/19922376-0-image-a-21_1571488117468.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
