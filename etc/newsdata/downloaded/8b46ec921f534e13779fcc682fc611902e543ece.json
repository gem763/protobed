I was so sad and then I knew I wanted a rhinoplasty.\n\n\"From a very young age, I knew I wanted to be blonde and beautiful like Jenna Jameson or Holly Madison - they're icons to me.\n\n\"I have had a lot done since then, including my lips, chin, cheeks, smile lines, rhinoplasty, a brow lift, my teeth whitened, jawline and Botox.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / @blondiesteffi)\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / @blondiesteffi)\n\n\"I also have fake lashes, love having my nails done and a lot of hair extensions. I love waist training all day to get the total doll look that it gives me.\n\n\"Before surgery, I didn't really like myself at all, but now, after having surgery I feel so much better about myself, however it still feels like there's a lot more to do! The procedures have helped boost my confidence a lot and I've gained many more Instagram followers since sharing pictures showing the work I've had done.\n\n\"I haven't had a boob job yet, but I would like to soon. I don't know how many times I've had my lips done because it's too many times to count, but it's been every month since I was 17.\n\n\"There are many more surgeries I want to have done in the future, including BBL, a hairline lowering, breast implants, cheek implants, super white veneers, rib removal, face lift, butt implants, hip implants, another nose job, liposuction in arms and inner thighs, cat eye surgery, buccal fat remove and silicone implants in my lips.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / @blondiesteffi)\n\n\"The inspiration for my look comes from Bratz dolls as well as Barbie and Playboy playmates.\"\n\nStefanie says that her life has become easier since enhancing her look, and she has no intention of stopping her addiction in the near future.\n\nFortunately, Stefanie's family and friends approve of her new look and they support the changes she makes, which they think look good.\n\n\"Nothing has become hard to do since having the procedure, if anything my life has just become easier,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't know how much I've spent on my addiction in total, but I try to just keep it to about 15,000 Swedish krona per month.\n\n\"My family and friends don't mind it at all, and they actually think it looks really good on me! I'm really happy with the results so far and I'm not planning on stopping anytime soon.\"", "description": "Stefanie Mulic, from Sweden, had her first lip fillers at the age of 13, and has a lot more cosmetic work planned", "authors": ["Alyce Collins", "Image", "Mdwfeatures", "Blondiesteffi"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20548791.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Fillers-At-Thirteen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
