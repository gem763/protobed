It happens every year, to be fair. Dev had so much to give. He was brilliant in my opinion.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\n(Image: DIGITAL/EROTEME.CO.UK)\n\n\"I felt the show itself did its job, the pros did their job, the celebrities did their job, but the judges didn't do their job. It was a bit of a farce. The wrong person this evening is gone. It comes from the judging being all over the place. I mean, David and Nadiya with 28 points in front of five other couples. It's impossible.\"\n\nHe added: \"The public aren't the experts, but from reading my Twitter account they seem to get it more right than the judges have. The only job they have to get right is get the leaderboard right because otherwise they'll have people like Dev, who in my opinion was an amazing talent, brilliant for the show, now he's gone home because the judges didn't do their job.\"\n\nDev and Dianne were knocked out of the contest last night after facing Emma Weymouth and Aljaz Skorjanec in the dance off.\n\n(Image: DIGITAL/EROTEME.CO.UK)\n\nSign up for our Strictly updates Love Strictly?

Dianne and Dev deserved so much better! boycott now.\"\n\n(Image: DIGITAL/EROTEME.CO.UK)\n\nAnd one viewer vented: \"Nah I'm fuming, Dev and diane should have NOT gone out, boycott strictly I say.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
