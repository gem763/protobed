Warren, who\u2019s leading the Democratic race along with Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, even suggested in a series of tweets Tuesday that Facebook may have changed one of its policies against misinformation in order to appease Trump.\n\n\u201cFacebook has incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. Mark Zuckerberg is telling employees that he views a Warren administration as an \u2018existential\u2019 threat to Facebook. The public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election,\u201d Warren tweeted on Monday. \u201cFor instance, Trump and Zuckerberg met at the White House two weeks ago. What did they talk about?\u201d\n\nSenator Warren warned that Facebook has a tremendous amount of power, the ability to swing elections, and she even brought up recently leaked audio that showed Zuckerberg is terrified of a potential Warren presidency. Zuckerberg said that he would sue the U.S. government if Warren tried to break up Big Tech companies, a sentiment that Zuckerberg has not echoed whenever the company has been attacked by Trump.\n\nZuck\u2019s meeting with Trump occurred on September 20, though we don\u2019t know what exactly was discussed. What we do know is that it wasn\u2019t long before Facebook changed its ad policies to allow some objectively false information on its platform as long as those ads were bought by politicians.\n\n\u201cAfter that meeting, Facebook quietly changed its policies on \u2018misinformation\u2019 in ads, allowing politicians to run ads that have already been debunked by independent, non-partisan fact-checkers,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cPut another way, Facebook is now ok with running political ads with known lies.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re allowing Trump to spend over $1 million a week right now for ads on their platform\u2014including ones that air the same lies that TV stations won\u2019t. Here\u2019s an example of an ad that Facebook let Trump run despite being obviously untrue: https://t.co/sQdKCmrkOr pic.twitter.com/2X2S95Ep0H \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019\n\nCNN has rejected at least two TV ads from the Trump regime that contained obvious lies about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, but Facebook has allowed those same ads on its platform. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection campaign spends millions on Facebook ads to reach potential voters and the increasingly authoritarian leader of the U.S. has significantly increased spending on Facebook ever since the Democrats started impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once because they were asleep at the wheel while Russia attacked our democracy \u2014 allowing fake, foreign accounts to run ad campaigns to influence our elections,\u201d Warren tweeted.\n\nZuckerberg has repeatedly argued that Facebook is only in a position to combat abuse on its platform because it\u2019s so large. The tech CEO, who has made billions off the private information of users, insists that breaking up the company wouldn\u2019t do anything positive for society.\n\nBut Warren is calling on Facebook executives to come answer congressional questions under oath about the policies that it\u2019s implementing and the potential impact those policies will have on the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe need accountability,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cThat should start with Congress and the appropriate state authorities opening investigations and conducting hearings to make Facebook executives explain the company\u2019s policies and practices \u2014 under oath.\u201d", "description": "U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren wants to know what Donald Trump and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked about during their Oval Office meeting last month.
