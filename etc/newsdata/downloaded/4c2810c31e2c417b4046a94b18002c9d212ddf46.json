It was attached to the door of a common room, Queen's said, and found Thursday morning.\n\nCBC Toronto has seen a copy of the note, which contains several epithets directed at Indigenous and LGBTQ students, such as the word \"f---ots.\"\n\n\"We took your flags and you wailed and cried,\" it reads. \"We'll scalp you all.\u2026 We'll make you bleed.\"\n\nThe fourth floor at Chown Hall is designated as an Indigenous & Allies community area, which includes about 50 Indigenous students and others with an interest in Indigenous culture.\n\nQueen's University and Kingston, Ont., police are investigating the incident.\n\nIn a statement, principal and vice-chancellor Patrick Deane called the note \"a cowardly violation of human rights and the dignity of individuals.\"\n\nDeane said the note was immediately removed. The university has also sent support staff to assist students at the dorm, which is home to around 200 students.\n\n\"Queen's has worked hard \u2014 and continues to work hard \u2014 to support and implement a wide array of initiatives aimed at increasing diversity and inclusion and combatting racist hatred. Clearly there is more work to be done,\" Deane's statement continued.\n\nA portion of the note containing homophobic, racist and threatening language is seen here.
