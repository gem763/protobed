It feels dangerous to me.'\n\nShe added that we should be able to make our own decisions about what we want to see and that it starts to feel 'complicated' when you start to legislate on what roles you can and cannot play.\n\nIn the interview she also opened up about how the MeToo movement has 'intersected unhappily with her own life'.\n\nMiller revealed she used to call Harvey Weinstein 'Pops' and said 'on some level' she did this to deflect her suspicions about him.\n\nShe said: 'I'd go, 'Oi Pops, give us a job', and he'd go, 'Ah, stappit.''\n\nThe actor, who worked with the disgraced film producer on numerous films including Factory Girl, also said no one ever 'propositioned her for work with sex', adding if they had she 'would probably have slapped them'.\n\nShe added that Weinstein did yell at her but that was 'just Harvey' and she would brush it off as he spoke to men in the same way.\n\nShe continued: 'I know that you couldn't say no to Harvey if he asked you to do something. For me, it would be, like, an extra week of press, so I imagine in a situation where it's sexual, it would also be hard to say no, and that's crushing.'\n\nMiller revealed she used to call Harvey Weinstein (pictured leaving court in New York in August this year) 'Pops' and said 'on some level' she did this to deflect her suspicions about him\n\nIn 2017 the actor also worked on James Toback's film The Private Life of a Modern Woman, before the director was engulfed in abuse allegations which Miller described as 'crushing' because he had been a family friend for a long time.\n\nIn her new film American Woman, Miller stars as the mother of a missing teenage girl living in Rust Belt, USA, which is released in cinemas on Friday.", "description": "In an interview the American-British actor, 37 opened up about her opinions on the film industry, criticising the 'whitewashing' of roles.
