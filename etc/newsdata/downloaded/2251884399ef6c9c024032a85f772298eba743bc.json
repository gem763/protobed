USA TODAY\n\nEven during the woebegone Randy Shannon era, the worst it ever got for the Miami Hurricanes was 5-7 with a team that had the misfortune of ending that year with losses to three consecutive ranked opponents. Heck, even in the throes of NCAA probation, postseason bans and scholarship losses that resulted from the Nevin Shapiro scandal, you\u2019re talking about a team that would have made bowl games every single year.\n\nAt a program like Miami, there are supposed to be guardrails in place to prevent a complete meltdown. When you\u2019re the most prominent school located in the middle of the most talent-rich metropolitan area in the United States, it is impossible under any circumstance to not have a pretty good roster relative to most of the teams you play. It doesn\u2019t mean Miami is always going to compete for national titles or have the most talented team in the ACC because history has shown us that\u2019s not true. But for all the program\u2019s flaws, the floor for Miami is relatively high. A three or four-win season isn\u2019t something that should ever happen, no matter how dysfunctional things have been.\n\nVirginia Tech defensive lineman TyJuan Garbutt (45) tackles Miami quarterback N'Kosi Perry (5) during the second half Saturday at Hard Rock Stadium.

Maybe there are some Diaz apologists out there who will argue that the 2-3 Hurricanes have lost each of their games by seven points or fewer. But that statistic doesn\u2019t really paint the picture of how poorly coached they\u2019ve looked in those losses, and particularly Saturday in a near-comeback against Virginia Tech. Down 28-0 in the first half against a similarly embattled program, give Miami some credit for regrouping behind backup quarterback N\u2019Kosi Perry and tying the game with 3:16 remaining. But in the end, it was 42-35 loss in which the Hurricanes had 11 penalties and committed five turnovers, at which point they should have just taken their infamous turnover chain and gifted it to the Hokies the same way they did everything else.\n\nBeyond the delicate quarterback issue for Miami \u2013 which will be interesting to watch unfold because starter Jarren Williams has seemingly regressed after a strong debut game against Florida \u2013 there\u2019s the very real possibility that this season is going to spiral away from Diaz just based on the schedule. The Hurricanes have Virginia next week and face road games down the stretch against resurgent Pitt, a Florida State team showing some signs of life and Duke. It doesn\u2019t even seem like a given at this point that Miami will beat Georgia Tech, Louisville and Florida International. All in all, there\u2019s real danger that this will be the worst Miami season since 3-8 under Lou Saban in 1977, which predates its birth as a nationally prominent program.\n\nGiven all the ups and downs Miami has been through since, that\u2019s not a great place to be for Diaz, the former defensive coordinator and Miami native. And it\u2019s why the Hurricanes rank No. 1 in this week\u2019s Misery Index, a weekly measurement of knee-jerk reactions based on what each fan base just watched.\n\nFOUR MORE IN MISERY\n\nWashington: Once a coach earns elite status from the college football cognoscenti, it\u2019s like getting tenure as a professor \u2013 you pretty much have it forever. But Chris Petersen is living off a reputation he no longer deserves, and the only title Washington is going to win any time soon is as the nation\u2019s most disappointing program. Since making the College Football Playoff in 2016, Washington has lost games each of the last three years as a double-digit favorite. The common denominator in those games? A sputtering offense, which no longer resembles the creative and freewheeling system that Petersen rode to prominence at Boise State. Washington\u2019s 23-13 loss Saturday to a very mediocre Stanford team featured a meager 294 yards of offense, while quarterback Jacob Eason completed just 16-of-36 passes. It was a similar story earlier in the season against Cal in a 20-19 loss, but this trend extends back to the Jake Browning era where the Huskies\u2019 lack of offensive explosiveness made them vulnerable to big upsets. Moreover, this is the second year in a row where Washington entered the season as a popular pick to make the playoff and yet suffered its second loss by mid-October. It doesn\u2019t mean Washington is a bad program or that Petersen isn\u2019t doing a good job overall, but we all need to start talking about the Huskies realistically rather than banking on some notion of coaching genius that isn\u2019t showing up in the results.\n\nUCLA: Everyone who got excited about a Chip Kelly breakthrough because the Bruins mounted an insane comeback from 32 points behind against Washington State a couple weeks ago can now safely return to their seats. The Washington State game was an outlier, a fluke, fueled by six Cougars turnovers, a couple special teams touchdowns and a compliant opponent. As it turns out, there is no breakthrough, just a new definition of rock bottom after a 48-31 loss to Oregon State in the Rose Bowl. The Bruins ended up with some good offensive numbers behind first-time starting quarterback Austin Burton, totaling 492 total yards while committing just two penalties. But UCLA was doomed by a nightmare start in which it failed to convert a fourth-and-1 on its own side of the field and got caught flat-footed on a pooch kickoff, putting the Bruins in a 21-0 hole after just six minutes. There\u2019s nothing positive to say about the direction of UCLA at this point. It\u2019s a bad team with a 1-5 record and fan base that has already checked out for the season, and perhaps for awhile. There are still plenty of people out there nationally who believe Kelly will turn it around, but getting blown out at home by Oregon State makes it look like things are getting worse, not better.\n\nVanderbilt: Fans of this program, few as they may be, know what the dark place looks like. They were trapped in it for most of the 1980s, the entire 1990s and basically all of the 2000s. Only in the last eight years has Vanderbilt been perceived as anything other than a joke of a program and an easy win in the SEC, but the signs of a backslide are now screaming like a siren. Vanderbilt\u2019s 31-6 loss at Ole Miss could be a major turning point for Derek Mason\u2019s tenure, as Vanderbilt has now lost three SEC games this season by 24, 28 and now 25 points in addition to an 18-point loss at Purdue, which has had a terrible year in its own right. Some will argue that Vanderbilt, given its history and relative lack of institutional commitment to football, couldn\u2019t have expected Mason to do significantly better than he did the last three years by going 17-21 with two bowl appearances. But if it looks as if the bottom is about to fall out \u2013 and based on the results this season, maybe that\u2019s already happened \u2013 can Vanderbilt really afford to keep going with this regime?\n\nCENTRAL FLORIDA: After demolishing Stanford in late September, athletics director Danny White whined about the Knights being ranked No. 16, telling Yahoo! Sports that \u201cthere has to be some other motivation\u201d for being slotted in the back half of the top-25. That kind of conspiratorial nonsense plays well with the hard-core fan base but has proved to be overwrought. As turns out, UCF was overrated if anything. The Knights\u2019 status as a thorn in the College Football Playoff committee\u2019s side ended a couple weeks ago with a loss to Pitt, and their two-year domination of the AAC is now over as well after a 27-24 loss to Cincinnati. This isn\u2019t a shot at the Knights, who put together back-to-back unbeaten regular seasons and became a massively important story/lightning rod for college football conversation. But maybe, just maybe, the people who were skeptical that UCF was really on par with the top power conference teams were right after all.\n\nTRENDING TOWARD MISERY\n\nAuburn: The Tigers desperately need the upcoming bye week to get freshman quarterback Bo Nix a bit of a breather and some quality practice time. Though Auburn was riding high on its 5-0 start, Nix hit a wall in the Swamp and completed just 11-of-27 passes for 145 yards with three interceptions and some truly awful decision-making in a 24-13 loss to Florida. After Auburn averaged just 3.6 yards per rush, the Gus Malzahn haters have re-emerged from their burrows and are eyeing a schedule that includes LSU, Georgia and Alabama as the potential catalyst for buyout chaos to start all over again.\n\nPurdue: Almost exactly a year ago, Jeff Brohm was the toast of college football after beating Ohio State in Week 7, setting events in motion for him to stay at Purdue on a $36.8 million contract spread over seven years. Now you have to wonder whether he might have been better off hitting the reset button and going home to Louisville. Brohm has turned around seasons before \u2013 just last year, Purdue was 0-3 before winning four in a row \u2013 but this has been a surprisingly bleak start for the Boilermakers at 1-4. There\u2019s enough dreck populating the Big Ten West to think Purdue can scratch its way into a bowl game, but the Boilermakers need to fix an offensive line that hasn\u2019t been able to create much push all year and gave up 10 sacks in a 35-7 loss to Penn State.\n\nBoston College: Seemingly every year of Steve Addazio\u2019s tenure, the margin for error is exceedingly thin. Every time his teams look down for the count, they roar back and win a couple close games. Every time they get on a roll, there\u2019s always an inexplicable loss waiting to pull the Eagles back to that 7-6 territory they seem so comfortable living in. Boston College\u2019s latest challenge is an unspecified leg injury to quarterback Anthony Brown suffered in a wild 41-39 loss to Louisville. If a few plays over the Eagles\u2019 last two games had gone the other way, they\u2019d be 5-1 right now and potentially in the top 25. Instead, they\u2019re 3-3 and right on track for another lower-tier bowl. At least running back A.J. Dillon remains a terrific show, having rushed for 150-plus in three of their last four games.\n\nTulsa: With a 30-9 lead over unbeaten SMU at the end of the third quarter Saturday, the Golden Hurricane was poised to spoil of one of the nation\u2019s feel-good stories. Instead, they became a cautionary tale for how not to finish a game, giving up touchdown drives of 19, 10 and 14 plays to allow SMU to tie. (For some context, SMU\u2019s 43 plays in the fourth quarter wasn\u2019t too far off the 58 Washington ran for the entire game against Stanford.) To make matters worse, kicker Jacob Rainey missed a 43-yarder in the second overtime that would have ended the game and Zack Long missed a 42-yarder to begin the third overtime.\n\nRice: There are only two winless FBS teams left, and one of them is the Owls, who have actually had a legitimate shot to win half their games but are sitting at 0-6 after a 35-20 loss to UAB. At this point, though, the Owls have to be cursing their luck. They were right in the game Saturday in Birmingham, trailing just 21-20 at halftime before a thunderstorm came in and delayed the start of the second half by an hour. When the second half began, though, Rice immediately encountered a huge downpour followed by another 30-minute weather delay and never scored another point. When even the weather gods are conspiring to hand you more losses, what chance do you really have?\n\nTOTALLY REAL AND IRRATIONAL MESSAGE BOARD THREADS\n\n\u201cPlease tell me one of you threw something at those officials\u201d \u2013 CanesInsight\n\n\u201cThe score, the attendance, enough to make a grown man cry\u201d \u2013 BruinZone\n\n\u201cPost Petersen Era needs to start today\u201d \u2013 HarcoreHusky\n\n\u201cFace it, friends, the honeymoon is over\u201d \u2013 GoldandBlack.com (Purdue)\n\n\u201cPrepare to lose 5 games this season\u201d \u2013 UCFSports.com", "description": "All in all, there\u2019s real danger that this will be the worst University of Miami football season since 3-8 under Lou Saban in 1977.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published P.M.
