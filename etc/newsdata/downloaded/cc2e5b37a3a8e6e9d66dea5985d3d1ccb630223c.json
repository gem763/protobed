That\u2019s nearly three times the size of the crowd that turned up for Mr. Modi at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden five years ago. Perhaps lured by the yugeness, President Trump plans to speak as well.\n\nSince winning power in 2014, Mr. Modi has honed the overseas rally as an instrument to boost both Indian diplomacy and the prime minister\u2019s political standing at home. He has addressed diaspora audiences in Sydney, Toronto, London, Singapore, Johannesburg and elsewhere. But America stands out: It\u2019s home to 4.4 million people of Indian origin, the richest and most influential Indian diaspora in the world. Mr. Modi\u2019s speech Sunday will be his fourth address to Indian-Americans in five years.\n\nThe prime minister wears his admiration for Indian-Americans on his sleeve. (In large part the affection is mutual, though observers also expect throngs of protesters in Houston.) In New York, Mr. Modi praised the community for raising India\u2019s standing in the world. In San Jose, Calif., he hailed it as a \u201cbrain deposit\u201d rather than a \u201cbrain drain\u201d from India. In Washington, he talked about Indian immigrants having \u201chelped the USA to become more prosperous.\u201d\n\nBut at the heart of these spectacles lies a paradox. If Mr. Modi\u2019s domestic policies are any indication, he appears not truly to grasp the basis of Indian-Americans\u2019 success. They have thrived because America is built on principles that encourage it: a belief in free enterprise, an embrace of diversity and a meritocratic culture. On Mr. Modi\u2019s watch, India has regressed on all three fronts.\n\nNevertheless, these jamborees enhance India\u2019s diplomatic clout. Mr. Trump\u2019s presence signals Washington\u2019s support for New Delhi, much appreciated amid a spate of bad press over last month\u2019s heavy-handed abrogation of autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir, the disputed Himalayan territory claimed by both India and Pakistan. The likely presence of House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, along with both Republican and Democratic members of Congress, gives that support bipartisan sheen.\n\nDomestic politics may matter even more. Indian TV news channels will beam wall-to-wall coverage of the Houston event\u2014called \u201cHowdy, Modi!\u201d\u2014to millions of homes. The sight of Mr. Modi rousing supporters in the world\u2019s most powerful country cements his image as a conquering hero astride the global stage and widens the gap in stature between the prime minister and his rivals. These rallies contribute to the belief, widely held in India, that Mr. Modi has enhanced the country\u2019s stature, too.\n\nReality is less rosy. After five years in power, Mr. Modi\u2019s reputation as an economic administrator has taken a beating. In the quarter ending June 30, the economy grew at only 5%, its slowest in six years, after declining for five consecutive quarters. If Indian statistics exaggerate GDP growth, as Harvard\u2019s Arvind Subramanian recently suggested in a widely cited paper, the country starts to look like a largely agrarian economy languishing at postindustrial economic growth rates. International money managers have sold $4.5 billion of Indian shares since June. According to Bloomberg, they\u2019re on course for the biggest quarterly exodus in two decades.\n\nCyclical factors and a global slowdown have no doubt contributed to India\u2019s sluggishness. But Mr. Modi\u2019s overreliance on bureaucrats, mistrust of market forces, and occasional flirtation with crank economic theorists from his Hindu nationalist movement have exacerbated the problem.\n\nMany economists tie the beginning of India\u2019s downturn to the prime minister\u2019s 2016 decision to nuke nearly 90% of India\u2019s currency in a quixotic attempt to destroy so-called black money. In 2017 the government implemented a shoddy nationwide value-added tax despite pleas from experts who pointed out that high rates, a complex multislab structure, and overly stringent reporting requirements made it the opposite of the \u201cgood and simple\u201d tax that was promised.\n\nAt the same time, rapacious tax inspectors, tasked with collecting the vast amounts needed to fund Mr. Modi\u2019s ambitious welfare schemes, have driven thousands of wealthy Indians abroad. Privatization has stalled, in part because Mr. Modi appears to believe that hiring the right managers\u2014often retired bureaucrats\u2014can make state-owned companies profitable and allow him to avoid selling them to private investors. On trade, the Modi government has reversed a quarter-century of liberalization by raising tariffs.\n\nMore fundamentally, Mr. Modi has raised fears that his government will undermine the bedrock of Indian stability: its management of religious and linguistic diversity. The Silicon Valley tech giants and Texas oil companies that hire talented Indian engineers don\u2019t care how their employees pray or what they keep in their freezers. In India, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s agenda includes harsh punishments for cow slaughter and discouraging interfaith marriages by raising the phantasm of \u201clove jihad\u201d by Muslim men in search of Hindu brides.\n\nMr. Modi deserves credit for grasping the importance of Indian-Americans as an example to emulate. But unless he re-examines his policies, the applause at \u201cHowdy, Modi!\u201d won\u2019t change the reality that many people are instead choosing to say, \u201cGoodbye, India.\u201d", "description": "He\u2019s held four U.S. rallies in five years, but still doesn\u2019t seem to grasp how freedom feeds prosperity.", "authors": ["Sadanand Dhume"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108734/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
