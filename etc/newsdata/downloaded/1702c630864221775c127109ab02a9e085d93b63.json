(Gif: United Artists)\n\nEverything about The Addams Family beyond the (admittedly great) casting has confused me. A new animated adaptation of the creepy family? OK, I get it, but the art style\u2026 seems a little off? The plot involves them, uh, going to New Jersey? And there\u2019s been almost no marketing? Every bit of new information that trickles out about this film, I become more wary. Surely the Addams Family, inspiration to goth nerds everywhere, deserves better.\n\nI was expecting to find the same thing when I read that Christina Aguilera had made a song for Morticia Addams to go on the soundtrack of the new film. Aguilera\u2019s pretty great, obviously, but it seemed like just another baffling detail in a baffling film. Well, readers, I\u2019m here to tell you I was mistaken: Christina Aguilera\u2019s Morticia Addams song, \u201cHaunted Heart,\u201d totally fucking rules.\n\nThis song treats Morticia Addams for what she is: a total badass. It\u2019s got this haunted torch song feel, as Aguilera\u2019s voice crisply carries us through a gothic love story. This is Morticia as a loud, powerful, terrifying heroine, precisely the goth icon generations of weirdos have fallen in love with. Listening to \u201cHaunted Heart,\u201d I\u2019m terrified of this woman, and I also want to be her. I at least want to watch her makeup tutorials, even though they probably involve murder.\n\nI\u2019m still sceptical of The Addams Family. But I\u2019m hoping that we get something worthy of this badass song.\n\nThe Addams Family is in theatres December 5.", "description": "Everything about The Addams Family beyond the (admittedly great) casting has confused me.
