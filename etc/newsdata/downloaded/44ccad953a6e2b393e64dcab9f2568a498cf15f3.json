Rather than drive Uber or tend coffee shop counters, an increasing amount of these educators are choosing to supplement their income by going on dates with wealthy \"daddies.\"\n\nScreen shot of Seeking Arrangement website Seeking Arrangement\n\nThese sugar daddy relationships are cultivated through a website called Seeking Arrangement, which works by connecting wealthier men or women (sugar daddies and mommas) with \"attractive people looking for finer things in life,\" (sugar babies.) Daddies and babies make arrangements where the daddy may spend lavishly on the baby in exchange for the baby's company. In some longer-term relationships, daddies provide babies with monthly monetary allowances. Some of the wealthiest daddies have even been known to pay for their baby's rent, or when the baby is a student, pay for their college tuition.\n\nSeeking Arrangement claims to have over 10 million active members, including 8 million babies. It turns out a not insignificant number of these sugar babies actually spend part of their day teaching children. According to The New York Post, just over 10,000 of the site's members self-identified as educators.\n\nTeacher salaries vary widely by state, but nationwide the average public school teacher can expect to bring home $60,483. In some states, like Mississippi and West Virginia, teachers on average make less than $46,000 per year. The average Sugar Baby, according to Seeking Arrangement's own stats, supposedly brings in $2,800 every month from their dates. That comes out to $33,600 per year. For some educators, that's nearly equivalent to working a second full-time teaching job.\n\nRead more: Here's how much every US state pays its teachers and spends on a single student\n\nIn some cases, the perks extended beyond the allowance. An educator who went by the name Nolah explained her lavish arrangement as a sugar baby in an interview with Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\n\"I can go on a date, I can have steak and lobster, be gone for three hours after my kids are already asleep and come home with $500,\" Nolah told Yahoo Lifestyle. Nolah said she struggled to pay off basic bills with her teaching income and viewed Seeking Arrangement as a second job. An analysis of national education data by EdWeek found one in five US teachers supplemented their teaching income with a part-time job.\n\nDespite the clear financial incentives, Seeking Arrangement does not publicize the baby's role strictly as a job and opts instead of the term \"lifestyle choice.\" The company's public relations manager, Alexis Germany expanded on the dynamic in an email sent to Business Insider.\n\n\"The financial aspect of the relationship is something that can be brought up once a level of trust has been built. Anyone asking for money upfront is treating the situation as a job, and Sugar dating is not a job, it's a lifestyle choice.\"\n\nSeeking Arrangement's plagued by allegations of prostitution and harassment from daddies.\n\nScreen shot of Seeking Arrangement website Seeking Arrangement\n\nSince its founding in 2006, Seeking Arrangment has had to deflect allegations that it facilitates prostitution Other issues with the site have arisen with upset daddies who've blurred the lines between a transaction and a relationship. In one of those cases, a former baby took her daddy to court after he continually harassed her on social media for leaving the arrangement.\n\nTwo of the sugar baby teachers Yahoo Lifestyle spoke to said they had sex with their daddies, but said it was the result of a long term relationship rather than an outright transaction.\n\nRead more: Professional 'sugar babies' share what it's really like to get paid to hang out with rich guys\n\nSeeking Arrangement doesn't hide from these points.
