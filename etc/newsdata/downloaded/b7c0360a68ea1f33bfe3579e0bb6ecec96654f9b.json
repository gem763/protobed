Please, stop. We simply can\u2019t keep going on like this. Working into our weekends and being on constant alert, escaping the office physically but never, ever mentally (not entirely), not even when we vow to do a digital detox. We can feel ourselves worrying about what horrors lurk inside our inbox.\n\nThis week a study declared that while a ban on out-of-office emails could help some people to step away from work and feel a bit calmer, for others it could prevent them from getting all their work done, causing stress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Emma Russell, of the University of Sussex Business School, said \u2018[Blanket bans] would be unlikely to be welcomed by employees who prioritise work performance goals and who would prefer to attend to work outside of hours if it helps them get their tasks completed.\u2019\n\nCue a load of managers thinking: \u2018ah, yes, it\u2019s okay to send emails out of work-time and expect a response, because doing a blanket ban could make people worry!\u2019\n\nThis is, quite frankly, insane.\n\nIf someone is unable to get the work done during their office hours, the solution is not to welcome working all weekend or encourage them to be constantly contactable.\n\nEither they\u2019re not equipped to do the job, or the job\u2019s expectations need to radically change.\n\nIf a job simply cannot be done within a nine-hour working day, that\u2019s not an issue with workers, but with the job itself.\n\nWe\u2019re living in a bizarre world in which it\u2019s perfectly reasonable \u2013 and often encouraged \u2013 to place caring about work as a higher priority than our own mental wellbeing, or actually being a person rather than a worker.\n\nStop letting work seep into every bit of your life (Picture: Getty)\n\nSometimes, when I\u2019m in the middle of an email thread or I can hear people squabbling about a minor detail of their working world, I feel a desperate need to stand up and proclaim: \u2018you know we\u2019re all hurtling towards death, right? You know the earth is dying?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot to get too morbid, but one day you will die. Your working hours will make up a rather significant portion of your time on this mortal realm\u2026 but why should they take over the grand majority? Why are we so willing to dedicate our entire headspace to a job?\n\nWe work for a few reasons. We need money to live (and thus to do things we enjoy\u2026 although we\u2019re often working too hard to do those things, so this reason disappears). We might be lucky enough to enjoy our jobs and find them genuinely engaging. We want a sense of fulfillment and pride. If we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ve found some purpose and meaning in the work we do.\n\nPersonally, I do my job because I need money to pay for rent, so I have a comfortable place to store my candles and various skincare, and feed a small cat. I find it fun and interesting, and think if I didn\u2019t show up to work five days a week I would quickly get very, very bored.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve found a purpose in what I do, which is handy because I don\u2019t want to reproduce but I do need to know I have some greater meaning in my general existence. That\u2019s quite important to me, otherwise I lie in bed getting philisophical and wondering why I\u2019m even here on this earth.\n\nFor me that purpose is connecting with people and making them feel less weird and alone in the world, or lifting them up for a moment of humour or joy, or sharing the stories of brilliant people doing brilliant things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s not as important as saving sick children or solving world hunger, I\u2019m aware, but it\u2019s what keeps me going.\n\nBut I would never sacrifice my mental wellbeing or all the other bits of my life I enjoy for the sake of fulfilling that purpose a bit more. I\u2019m not going to run myself ragged and miss out on actually living. Why are we killing ourselves to work when the whole point of working is being able to live?\n\nYour job might be hugely important and essential. Good for you. You should still be able to complete it within working hours and without spending every waking moment of your life thinking about it. If you can\u2019t, you shouldn\u2019t be contorting your life to fit around work \u2013 it\u2019s our entire working culture that needs to change.\n\nWe need to all \u2013 bosses and CEOs especially \u2013 remember that we\u2019re humans trying to fill our moderately short lives with some sort of meaning. We\u2019re not just machines built for the purpose of ticking through a to-do list. We\u2019re all trying to be happy and fulfilled and work is just one part of that \u2013 it can\u2019t be our entire existence.\n\nThat means actually sticking to working hours rather than encouraging coming in early and staying late.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt means not going absolutely ballistic at someone when they make a mistake.\n\nIt means not making someone feel miserable day in, day out the second they turn on their work computer.\n\nIt means making flexible working the norm, so it\u2019s easy to actually do other things that give someone\u2019s life meaning, whether that\u2019s raising a child, writing a book, or protesting, or to do things that make us feel good (yes, including actually being able to sleep, thanks to a working schedule that matches up to our personal sleep cycles).\n\nWe decide the shape of our lives and what fills them (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nEssentially, it means remembering that whatever piece of work that needs doing can wait, that there are parts of life that are more important than filing that report or replying to an email. There has to be more to life than work, and our culture needs to radically change to make those other bits possible.\n\nWhen you think about big concepts of the meaning of life and the destruction of our plant, who can truly care about going to a pointless meeting or agonising over the best way to end an email?\n\nStop letting work seep into every bit of your life. Stop expecting people who work for you to exist only to do whatever you say.\n\nIt\u2019s time for humanity. It\u2019s time to stop sticking to rigid structure just because they\u2019re \u2018the way things are done\u2019. We decide the shape of our lives and what fills them. We can change things to make them better suit our actual wants and needs.\n\nThat might mean scrapping the five-day working week, banning work emails at the weekend, accepting flexible working as the norm, or allowing people to piss off and go travelling for a year to figure out what they want. Change is scary, but when work is so all-consuming that we\u2019re anxious that we\u2019re not able to play catch up during our time off, it\u2019s oh so necessary.\n\nMORE: Workers given four day week at law firm are \u2018less stressed and more productive\u2019\n\nMORE: Should you read work emails when you\u2019re on holiday?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "About to do some work you didn't manage to finish on Friday?
