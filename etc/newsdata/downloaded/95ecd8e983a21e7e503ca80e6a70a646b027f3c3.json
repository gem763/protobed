A self-driving Uber vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in the first death involving a fully autonomous test vehicle on March 19, 2018. The accident prompted the ride-hailing company to suspend road-testing of such cars in the US and Canada. The Volvo SUV was in self-driving mode with a human back-up operator behind the wheel in Tempe when a woman walking a bicycle was hit. Elaine Herzberg, 49, died in hospital. Police have said that the victim, 49 year old Elaine Herzberg, stepped out in front of the car suddenly and they do not believe the car was to blame. Uber suspended its self-driving vehicle testing in the Phoenix area, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. The testing has been going on for months as car makers and technology companies compete to be the first with cars that operate on their own. Uber's self-driving car crash that led to the death of a mother-of-two could have been avoided, driverless vehicle experts have claimed. Cortica, a firm that develops artificial intelligence for autonomous vehicles, has analysed the dash cam video. The company concludes the car, which failed to brake or swerve before the collision, had enough time to react and potentially save Ms Herzberg's life. Speaking to CNET, Cortica's CEO Igal Raichelgauz said the firm's self-driving AI system detected Ms Herzberg 0.9 seconds before impact. At this point the car was around 50 feet (15 metres) away. He said the autonomous car's cameras and radar system should have had enough time to pick up the pedestrian and react to the situation. Driverless cars are fitted with a system of cameras, radar and lidar sensors that allow them to 'see' their surroundings and detect traffic, pedestrians and other objects. An AI computer system then decides what actions the car takes to avoid a collision - a setup that is supposed to work as well at night as during the day. A top executive for the maker of Lidar sensors used on Uber's self-driving car said she was 'baffled' as to why the vehicle failed to recognise Ms Herzberg.\n\nThe cars will drive on a set circuit 11.8miles (19km) long and will pick up and drop off their passengers at unknown set locations \u2013 no details of the route have been revealed.\n\nResearch earlier this year found drivers in London travel at an average speed of 7mph, so it could take the cars around 1hr 41mins to complete the loop.\n\nThe roads they're being tested on have a maximum speed of 30mph.\n\nGrant Shapps MP, the Secretary of State for Transport, said: 'The untapped potential of self-driving vehicle technology is huge.\n\n'It could enhance road safety, tackle isolation, and create economic opportunities.\n\n'StreetWise\u2019s successful trial will be a major step to rolling out the next phase of the UK\u2019s transport revolution.'\n\nThe trials will allow FiveAI's technology to 'learn' routes around the area and to get used to reacting to its sensors in real-world situations.", "description": "Select commuters who live in the south London boroughs will be ferried to work by FiveAI's self-driving cars as they're tested in real-world conditions with a back-up driver on board.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/16/20135642-0-image-a-43_1571930172562.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
