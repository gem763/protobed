Cory Booker, D-N.J., and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas.\n\nIf he doesn't raise $800,000 by Oct. 31, he explained, his \"campaign will be silenced for good.\"\n\nI'm extremely proud of the historic and bold campaign we have built together.\n\n\n\nBut this is a critical moment\u2014 if my campaign can't raise $800,000 by October 31st, my campaign will be silenced for good.

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each raised about $25 million in the third quarter, Castro's campaign raised $3.5 million.\n\nDespite lagging behind his competitors, Castro's third quarter total was an improvement over his previous fundraising reports of $1.1 million in the first quarter and $2.8 million in the second.\n\nTo qualify for the November debate, candidates must register 3% in four polls approved by the Democratic National Committee -- which Castro has not been able to do. Castro has secured 165,000 grassroots contributions, the second requirement to qualify for the November debates.\n\nIt is uncertain if Castro will qualify for the next debate or raise the money he is asking for, but the fundraising strategy proved successful for Booker.\n\nOn Sept. 21, Booker's campaign released a memo stating that \"its now or never\" and set a goal of raising $1.7 million in just 10 days. According to the campaign, the \"final push\" brought in 46,000 donations, totaling $2.16 million for their third quarter.\n\nO'Rourke's campaign set a goal of raising $2 million in six weeks on Oct. 11.", "description": "Juli\u00e1n Castro took to Twitter on Monday to make a plea for $800,000 in an attempt to qualify for the fifth Democratic debate in November.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/julian-castro-gty-jc-191021_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
