However, he added in the same remarks, on Monday, that meetings are the only way to end wars.\n\nThe resignation this week of national security adviser John Bolton, a vocal critic of the proposed summit being planned in secrecy and known only to a small number of officials, could open the door to further engagements with the insurgent group.\n\n\u201cThe removal of such a prominent administration foe of talks could signal Trump\u2019s intention to circle back to negotiations,\u201d said Michael Kugelman, of the Wilson Center, a think tank in Washington. \u201cBy removing Bolton, he reduces the likelihood of White House resistance the next time around,\u201d\n\nThe chief U.S. negotiator, Zalmay Khalilzad, remains on the job and has continued to schedule meetings with counterparts for the remainder of September, according to people familiar with his plans, a sign that there may still be a chance to resuscitate the process. Mr. Khalilzad didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s spokesman in Qatar called on Mr. Trump on Thursday to return to the negotiating table and honor the administration\u2019s commitments to an agreement worked out by a team of U.S. negotiators following nine rounds of talks in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar.\n\n\u201cWe want resolution, not escalation of the issue\u2014that is why we concluded the peace agreement with [the] U.S.,\u201d the spokesman said in an interview. \u201cIn our view, peaceful solution of the Afghan issue is the best solution.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cBut if U.S. opts for continuation of the war, they will find us in the field strong and unwavering as ever.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s spokesman added that the group remains ready to sign the deal, which he said is about 3\u00bd pages long. Both the U.S. and the Taliban have said in separate statements that it was completed, and Mr. Khalilzad said it awaited only Mr. Trump\u2019s sign off.\n\nThere currently are about 14,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, some 5,000 more than when Mr. Trump took office. If the president stands by his vow to end talks, he either can withdraw troops without a deal or end his first term with more troops in Afghanistan than his predecessor.\n\nIt would also mean potentially facing the 2020 election without a major foreign policy deal under his belt, as talks with North Korea over its nuclear program and with China over trade have eluded resolution.\n\nIn Washington, both liberal and conservative camps have called for greater transparency regarding the agreement with the Taliban, and some have urged Mr. Trump to stick with his longtime opposition to the war.\n\nRep Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, issued a subpoena Thursday to Mr. Khalilzad to testify next week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fed up with this administration keeping Congress and the American people in the dark on the peace process,\u201d Mr. Engel said.\n\nOn Thursday, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a conservative Washington think tank, said the suspension of talks had offered a brief window to take stock of the situation and that Americans deserved to know more.\n\n\u201cThe American people have sacrificed too much and have too many core national security interests at stake in Afghanistan to be kept in the dark,\u201d authors Bradley Bowman and Bill Roggio wrote in a foundation newsletter. \u201cIf a deal with the Taliban supports American national security interests in Afghanistan, the administration should be able to defend it.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, they added, \u201cIt suggests it is a deal the U.S. should not have made in the first place.\u2019\n\nOther conservative voices, like Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) praised Mr. Trump for seeking an end to the so-called forever war in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cWhy do some neocons continue to advocate for endless wars?\u201d he said in a Twitter message.\n\nNegotiations between Mr. Khalilzad and Taliban representatives have centered on a U.S. troop withdrawal and U.S. demands that the Taliban renounce ties with al Qaeda and all Islamist militant groups, including Islamic State.\n\nAs part of the deal, the Taliban also must engage in talks with Afghans to decide on the country\u2019s political future and join U.S. efforts to reduce violence\u2014a provision that falls short of an actual cease-fire.\n\nNeither side has spelled out how closely the progress in intra-Afghan talks would be linked to a drawdown in troops, or how the U.S. would be able to continue to support Afghan government forces without violating the terms of the deal.\n\nThe Afghan government has expressed concern that the deal falls short of guaranteeing the U.S. will be able to protect and support its army and police.\n\nMr. Bolton had argued that the U.S. could withdraw troops in Afghanistan without signing a deal with the insurgents.\n\nThat view has been echoed by prominent Republicans such as Rep. Michael McCaul (R., Texas), the chairman and ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee who has called for a \u201cresidual force\u201d of highly trained military units.\n\n\u2014Craig Nelson in Kabul contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jessica Donati at jessica.donati@wsj.com", "description": "The Taliban on Thursday called on the U.S. to restart talks on ending the 18-year-old conflict in Afghanistan, urging the Trump administration to revisit a nearly completed deal.", "authors": ["Jessica Donati", "Jessica.Donati Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106751/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
