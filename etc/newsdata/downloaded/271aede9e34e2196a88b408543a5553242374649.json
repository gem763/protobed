The Israeli elections are scheduled to take place Tuesday.\n\nThe latest polls show a close race between Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud party and the centrist Blue and White party led by former armed forces chief Benny Gantz. It's Israel's second snap election in several months after Netanyahu failed to form a governing coalition following elections in April.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Lindsey Graham floated the idea of a mutual defense treaty at the annual Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas in April, saying that \u201can attack against Israel would be considered an attack against the United States.\u201d\n\nThe call between the two heads-of-state also came just days after POLITICO reported that government officials concluded Israel was behind the placement of cellphone surveillance devices that were found near the White House and other sensitive locations around Washington.\n\nTrump told reporters on Thursday that he found it \"hard to believe\" as his \"relationship with Israel has been great.\"\n\nNetanyahu flatly denied the report, saying it was \"a blatant lie.\"\n\nFollowing an attack claimed by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels on an oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia, Trump on Saturday spoke by phone with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, according to White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere. During the call, Trump re-affirmed his support for Saudi self-defense and committed to ensuring the stability of oil supplies, according to a pool report.\n\nTrump also tweeted about the Taliban, following the president's cancellation of Camp David peace talks with the Afghan group last week.\n\n\"The Taliban has never been hit harder than it is being hit right now. Killing 12 people, including one great American soldier, was not a good idea. There are much better ways to set up a negotiation. The Taliban knows they made a big mistake, and they have no idea how to recover!\" Trump wrote on Twitter, after spending the morning at his golf course in Virginia.", "description": "The Israeli elections are scheduled to take place Tuesday.", "authors": ["Christian Vasquez"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a0/31/2f12bb654a5daee3478ba70caf1b/19914-netanyahu-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
