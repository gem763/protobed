Viewed from abroad, the continent\u2019s papers report Boris Johnson being put in his place by a parliament he tried to defy \u2013 fighting for survival after a strategic misstep barely six weeks into office.\n\nFrance\u2019s daily Le Monde newspaper described Tuesday\u2019s events as \u201canother mad day in Brexitland\u201d, writing: \u201cIn the space of a few hours, Britain\u2019s new prime minister lost what remained of his majority in the Commons, failed to prevent a major rebellion in his own camp, and lost a crucial battle to no-deal opponents\u201d.\n\nIn Belgium, French-Language newspaper Le Soir\u2019s editorial is headlined \u201cHard Brexit, back to reality\u201d \u2013 and warns of a \u201cstinging setback\u201d for Mr Johnson. The country\u2019s Dutch-language daily newspaper De Standaard, meanwhile, runs with the headline \u201cParliament crushes Johnson\u201d and gleefully reproduces a Dutch-subtitled video of John Bercow telling Michael Gove to \u201cbe a good boy\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The paper\u2019s London correspondent described strategist Dominic Cummings as \u201cthe Rasputin of Johnson\u2019s extremist turn\u201d. Another Italian newspaper, La Stampa describes Tuesday\u2019s events as \u201cone of the most dramatic days in the country since the Second World War\u201d.\n\nThe Irish Times\u2019 chief political commentator wrote a column ahead of the vote headlined: \u201cWelcome to the United Kingdom of Absurdistan\u201d, which argues that \u201cBritain\u2019s democracy is built on feudalism and its unwritten constitution is feeble\u201d. Another columnist following the defeat declares that Britain needs a history lesson and that it is \u201ctime to tell London about our shared history and responsibility\u201d.\n\nEl Pa\u00eds, a Spanish daily newspaper, said the British parliament was not \u201cnot impressed with the popularity of Boris Johnson, nor intimidated by his bravado\u201d \u2013 accusing the prime minister of \u201cbabbling\u201d and ultimately \u201clearning just how fiercely a parliamentary system reacts when its powers are threatened\u201d.\n\nPoland\u2019s Gazeta Wyborcza notes that the defeat is considered a \u201chumiliation\u201d for the prime minister in the UK and in analysis adds: \u201cThe situation is the result of Johnson himself, who at the end of last week led to a sharp aggravation of the political dispute, asking the Queen to suspend the work of parliament for five weeks to prevent parliamentarians from blocking Brexit without an agreement.\u201d\n\nRomania\u2019s daily newspaper Adev\u0103rul runs a headline asking: \u201cWhich disaster scenario do you prefer? No-deal Brexit or early elections?\u201d The paper\u2019s columnist says Boris Johnson has met his \u201cfirst failure in his short career as prime minister\u201d. Bulgarian business newspaper Kapital says the prime minister\u2019s plans are \u201cseriously shaken\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany\u2019s top financial newspaper, Handelsblatt, wrote that Mr Johnson was \u201calready fighting for his political survival\u201d as his country \u201cslipped deeper and deeper into political chaos\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It adds that \u201cyesterday was full of remarkable scenes that recalled what a living institution parliament is\u201d, touching on Phillip Lee\u2019s defection to the Liberal Democrats and the \u201cmanspreading\u201d of Jacob-Rees Mogg.\n\nThe magazine\u2019s correspondent concludes: \u201cThe British parliament showed yesterday evening that it is more rebellious, more powerful, more agile than prime minister Boris Johnson has imagined \u2013 and it is unwilling to hand over power without a struggle to a strong-willed head of government.\u201d", "description": "Europe\u2019s press has watched on with amazement at the continuing Brexit drama in Britain.
