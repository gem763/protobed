She shaved her daughter\u2019s head on a regular basis to make her look like she had undergone chemotherapy, and forced Gypsy Rose to use a wheelchair \u2013 despite her not actually needing one.\n\nGypsy Rose was led to believe she had cancer and needed a wheelchair (Picture: HBO)\n\nGypsy Rose also underwent numerous surgeries that were later deemed unnecessary, and had injections and medicines adminstered that made her lose her teeth and induce symptoms of the conditions Dee Dee claimed her daughter had.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Gypsy Rose\u2019s cousin Bobby, she began using a wheelchair after she suffered an abrasion to her knee after being involved in a minor motorcycle accident aged seven. Dee Dee allegedly claimed that the abrasion was the sign of underlying injuries that would need surgery.\n\nGypsy Rose later claimed that while she knew she could walk and that she didn\u2019t have the mental age of a child, she believed her mum when she said she had cancer.\n\nGypsy Rose was born in 1991, and while her mother told people she was a teenager with a much younger mental age, she was actually an adult.\n\nDeeDee would deliberately keep Gypsy sick as part of her Munchausen by Proxy\n\nShe received trips to Disney World, backstage passes to concerts and media attention, with Habitat for Humanity even building the Blanchards as home with a wheelchair ramp and a hot tub.\n\nDee Dee was portrayed as a loving caretaker, but behind the scenes, she would physically abuse her daughter to control her.\n\nAccording to the documentary, she would hold Gypsy Rose\u2019s hand at all times, and would squeeze it hard if she said anything that suggested she was not as sick as her mother claimed.\n\nAs Gypsy Rose grew older, a number of doctors found that she tested negative for muscular dystrophy and that she could indeed walk. And in 2012, Gypsy Rose \u2013 then 21 \u2013 met Nicholas Godejohn on the internet. The pair grew close, with Gypsy Rose later telling a neighbour that they were considering eloping. In 2013, Gypsy Rose organised for Nicholas to visit her home in Springfield, Missouri, when they began their sexual relationship. They also began planning Dee Dee\u2019s murder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn June 2015, Godejohn came to the Blanchard house while Dee Dee was asleep, with Gypsy Rose allegedly giving him a knife, gloves and duct tape before she hid in a bathroom.\n\nShe claims that she didn\u2019t think Nicholas would carry out the act. However, he stabbed Dee Dee to death, before having sex with Gypsy Rose and fleeing to Wisconsin.\n\nWhile it was initially theorised that Gypsy Rose was kidnapped, her relationship with Godejohn was soon discovered, and after the pair were traced via their IP address, they surrendered.\n\nIn July 2015, the abuse Gypsy Rose experienced came to light, and she accepted a plea bargain of second degree murder with a 10 year prison sentence.\n\nEarlier this year, Godejohn was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nMommy Dead and Dearest tells the tragic story with interviews with Gypsy, family members and friends, medical records, home videos and text messages, to provide the full picture of the events which led to Dee Dee\u2019s murder.\n\nMommy Dead and Dearest is available to watch on Sky True Crime.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
