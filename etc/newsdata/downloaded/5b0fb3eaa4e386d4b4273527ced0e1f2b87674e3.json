Especially as this is my last World Cup,\" Van der Merwe told reporters in Kobe on Sunday.\n\n\"I played against them in sevens back in the day, but this is an opportunity I am really looking forward to.\"\n\nVan der Merwe, who emigrated to Canada in 2003 and made his debut for the team three years later, has vast experience in European rugby with Scottish club Glasgow Warriors, Scarlets in Wales and a brief spell with Newcastle Falcons in England.\n\nBut he admits there is little that can prepare him for the physicality of a meeting with the Springboks.\n\n\"They are well-coached, they have got a physical pack that is complimented with a really speedy backline. For us it is just an opportunity to measure ourselves against one of the best teams in the world.\n\n\"They are a great squad from 1-31, it doesn\u00b4t matter who they pick those guys will perform and do their best. But we have done our homework on some things that hopefully we can exploit on Tuesday.\"\n\nAnother South Africa-born player, centre Guiseppe du Toit, joined the squad this week as an injury replacement and will start on the bench.\n\nTeam: 15-Andrew Coe, 14-Jeff Hassler, 13-Conor Trainor, 12-Ciaran Hearn, 11-DTH Van Der Merwe, 10-Peter Nelson, 9-Phil Mack, 8-Tyler Ardron (captain), 7-Matt Heaton, 6-Lucas Rumball, 5-Kyle Baillie, 4-Evan Olmstead, 3-Jake Ilnicki, 2-Andrew Quattrin, 1-Hubert Buydens\n\nReplacements: 16-Benoit Piffero, 17-Djustice Sears-Duru, 18-Matt Tierney, 19-Josh Larsen, 20-Michael Sheppard, 21-Jamie Mackenzie, 22-Shane O'Leary, 23-Guiseppe du Toit.
