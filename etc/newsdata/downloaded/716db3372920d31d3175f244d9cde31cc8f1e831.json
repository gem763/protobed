It\u2019s made for founders who are navigating domains outside their expertise, covering topics they may be learning for the first time like enterprise sales, product management, and finance/accounting.\n\nIn this episode:\n\nWhen and how should a company seek press coverage? The difference between marketing and communications Building relationships with reporters Being or identifying a great communications leader\n\nEarly on, most founders and investors focus on getting positive press, but if they\u2019re unfortunate or make mistakes, mitigating bad coverage becomes a common goal. Broadly, communications consists of how and what information to share, both inside and outside of the company, touching domains like management, recruiting, marketing, and business development. It\u2019s also highly optimizable and often, mission critical \u2014 the difference between dramatic success and catastrophic failure.\n\nWe spoke with three communications experts to learn more:\n\nSean Garrett was Twitter\u2019s first VP of Communications. He previously worked for Governor Pete Wilson of California and has founded two separate communications firms, with clients including Slack, Cisco, and Disney. He\u2019s currently a Managing Partner at Pramana Collective.\n\nFaryl Ury is a former reporter with experience at NPR and the Associated Press. Her communications experience also began in government, working for US Senator Jeanne Shaheen before managing comms at Square and Uber. She was then a marketing executive at Dropbox before becoming the Director of Communications at Aurora, a leading autonomous vehicle company, with investors including Sequoia Capital, Amazon, and Hyundai.\n\nAdi Raval started as a journalist at ABC News and the BBC, covering 9/11, the Iraq War, and the White House. He moved into government as a diplomat for the State Department serving in Afghanistan, and later, as a spokesperson and Director of Communications at USAID. After leaving government, Adi was the top communications executive for the Bechtel Corporation, the Head of Comms and PR for TaskRabbit, and now the Head of Communications at Kodiak Robotics. He\u2019s also a term member for the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nBelow is a synthesized summary of our conversation; check out The Operators for the full episode.\n\nWhen and how should a company seek press coverage?\n\nInvestors love to see public recognition of their portfolio companies, and founders sometimes believe press coverage will solve all their problems, yielding a panacea of inbound customers, employees, and new backers. Whether it\u2019s a fundraising announcement or a product launch, more exposure can only help, right? Of course, that\u2019s not always true. Being unprepared for an influx of inbound interest can lead to bad experiences and a negative reputation.\n\nWhat\u2019s more likely than a bad response? No response at all: reporters are constantly pitched by entrepreneurs seeking coverage who don\u2019t have a compelling story to share, which means most of them are primed to say \u201cno.\u201d\n\nFaryl told us that when she asks founders why they want to do press, they often answer, \u201cour investors told us to,\u201d or \u201cI talked to other entrepreneurs and they do press.\u201d Being prepared for the response means knowing what you want the response to be, which in turn means knowing what you have to say, and why anyone will listen and respond the right way. Thinking through this exercise involves asking questions, said Sean, specifically, \u201cwhat is your positioning? What is your messaging? And for some organizations, that\u2019s the right first step to figure out, at a high level, what are we even trying to accomplish here\u2026?\u201d\n\nHaving a clear purpose in mind before approaching reporters will also help you execute. For some startups, landing a story with trade press may be better than being written up by a generalized tech publication. On the other hand, if you\u2019re spending a ton of money on Facebook and Google to advertise directly to consumers, getting coverage in the right publications may be much more efficient and impactful.", "description": "Welcome to this edition of The Operators, a recurring Extra Crunch column produced by insiders with executive experience.", "authors": ["Tim Hsia", "Neil Devani"], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tim_reckmann_megaphone.jpg?w=600", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
