Billie does not know Ms. Weller. And to my knowledge, Carrie did not know her.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the book discusses the actress\u2019 final hours before her untimely death in December 2016. Weller's publisher did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nLourd\u2019s statement concluded by advising \u201cfans and friends of Carrie\u201d to read the late actress\u2019 own books about her life instead of Weller\u2019s.\n\nCARRIE FISHER WINS POSTHUMOUS GRAMMY AWARD AT PRE-SHOW CEREMONY\n\n\u201cFor all the fans and friends of Carrie, I just thought it necessary that you know this information before you decided to purchase this book or consider what is being said in the upcoming press interviews Weller will do while trying to sell it,\" Lourd's statement continued. \"To be clear I haven\u2019t read the book. The only books about Carrie Fisher worth reading are the ones Carrie wrote herself. She perfectly told us everything we needed to know.\u201d\n\nThe release of the book, set to be published on Nov. 12, comes as Fisher returns to the public eye in the latest \u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\u201d trailer in which her General Leia character is featured by way of archive footage.\n\nMeanwhile, Billie posted a tribute to her late mom on Instagram on Oct. 21, which would have been Fisher\u2019s 63rd birthday.\n\nBILLIE LOURD AND LATE MOM CARRIE FISHER WILL REUNITE IN 'RISE OF SKYWALKER'\n\nIn the post, Lourd, 27, and a few friends sing an acoustic version of \"American Girl\" by Tom Petty in her mother's honor.\n\n\"Happy birthday, Momby,\" she captioned the video. \"Today would have been my Momby's 63rd birthday. Not that I'm some kind of grief expert by any means, but on milestones (or whatever you want to call them) like this, I like to celebrate her by doing things that she loved to do.\"\n\nLorde then explained her choice in song and setting.\n\n\"So here's a little video of me singing one of her favorite songs (American girl by Tom Petty) in one of her favorite places (her bathtub of course). I'll probably have a pint of vanilla Haggen Dazs and a Coca Cola for dinner.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFisher died suddenly in December of 2016 after a heart attack on an airplane. Fisher's mother and Lourd's grandmother, Debbie Reynolds, died just a day later after a stroke at the age of 84.\n\nFox News\u2019 Nate Day contributed to this report.", "description": "Carrie Fisher\u2019s family is denouncing an upcoming book about the late \u201cStar Wars\u201d actress after the author didn\u2019t involve the family in its writing.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/7b769a79-carrie-fisher.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
