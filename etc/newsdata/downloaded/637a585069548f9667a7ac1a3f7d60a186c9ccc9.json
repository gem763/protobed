I am concerned about my young grandchildren coming to the house. I would be devastated if they were to see this man with no trousers on.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt Manchester Crown Court, Condron who lives alone in a 1950s semi detached house in Salford, admitted three charges of indecent exposure and breaching a 2015 Sexual Harm Prevention Order which had banned him for five years from being \u2018visible to any person whilst naked.\u2019\n\nHe pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court (Picture: PA)\n\nCondron, who has dementia, is currently undergoing hormone treatment to reduce his testosterone levels in a bid to curb his behaviour.\n\nThe latest incidents occurred between October 2018 and April this year after Condron had previously been reported to police for other flashing offences.\n\nProsecutor Nicholas Clarke said: \u2018One of the neighbours said this defendant had been exposing his penis to her when she opened the blinds in the morning, as part of her normal routine.\n\n\u2018She would see Bernard Condron behind a set of French doors holding his penis and she said over a two month period it happened almost everyday.\n\n\u2018Some days he would be masturbating and sometimes swinging from side to side. She didn\u2019t find this funny at all.\u2019\n\nAnother neighbour was in her bathroom about to have a shower when she looked outside and saw Condron stood outside with no trousers on, masturbating.\n\nIn mitigation defence counsel Julian Goode said: \u2018This man is 75. He is a man of poor health mentally and physically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Medical treatment has been offered which will make this kind of conduct less likely as it will reduce testosterone levels, reduce sexual inclination and reduce the ability to obtain and maintain an erection.\n\n\u2018The neighbours all want this to stop and he is very very concerned about his behaviour and does wish deeply that his actions will stop too.\u2019\n\nDeferring sentence for six months, Judge Alan Conrad QC told Condron: \u2018I am not making any promises. If you stay out of trouble and behave in a way without upsetting any neighbours, there is a chance I won\u2019t send you to prison. But if you start to expose yourself, you will be going to custody. Carry on with your medical treatment.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
