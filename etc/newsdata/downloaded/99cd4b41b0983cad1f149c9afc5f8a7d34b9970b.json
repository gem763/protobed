The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act requires the national intelligence director to submit whistleblower documents to Congress within seven days.\n\nThis all started on September 9, when the Intelligence Community inspector general transmitted a letter to the Schiff's committee notifying it of the existence of a whistleblower complaint. \u2014 Kate Brannen (@K8brannen) September 14, 2019\n\nOn September 13, Schiff received a letter from Maguire declining Schiff's request, saying the complaint involves confidentially and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community. \u2014 Kate Brannen (@K8brannen) September 14, 2019\n\nOn Friday, three days after Schiff asked Maguire to submit the documents to the committee, the acting director declined to provide them.\n\nMaguire told the House Intelligence Committee that he couldn\u2019t submit the complaint because it involves \u201cconfidentially and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community,\u201d according to Schiff.\n\n\u201cA Director of National Intelligence has never prevented a properly submitted whistleblower complaint that the [intelligence community\u2019s inspector general] determined to be credible and urgent from being provided to the congressional intelligence committees. Never,\u201d Schiff said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis raises serious concerns about whether White House, Department of Justice or other executive branch officials are trying to prevent a legitimate whistleblower complaint from reaching its intended recipient, the Congress, in order to cover up serious misconduct,\u201d he added.\n\nSchiff's letter also reveals that Maguire consulted the Justice Department about what to do \"in a further departure from the statute.\" \u2014 Kate Brannen (@K8brannen) September 14, 2019\n\nIn a letter sent Friday to Maguire, Schiff said the House Intelligence Committee \u201ccan only conclude ... that the serious misconduct at issue involves the President of the United States and/or other senior White House or administration officials.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis raises grave concerns that [the office of the director of national intelligence], together with the Department of Justice and possibly the White House, are engaged in an unlawful effort to protect the President and conceal from the Committee information related to his possible \u2018serious or flagrant\u2019 misconduct, abuse of power, or violation of law,\u201d he added.\n\nThe whistleblower first filed the complaint with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general on Aug. 12, and the inspector general shared the complaint with Maguire on Aug. 26. Maguire had until Sept. 2 to bring the complaint to Congress\u2019 intelligence committees, Schiff noted in a letter to the Maguire.\n\nIf Maguire doesn\u2019t hand over the complaint documents, the House Intelligence Committee will summon him to testify before Congress in an open hearing on Thursday.", "description": "The House Intelligence Committee filed a subpoena for the complaint after Schiff said the acting director of national intelligence had refused to hand it...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7c4e39240000d32679cf5c.jpeg?cache=cbn95t1qvr&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
