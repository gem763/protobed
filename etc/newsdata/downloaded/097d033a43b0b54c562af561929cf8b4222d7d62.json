The official emphatically denied that there was any link between blocking the aid and pressing Zelensky into investigating the Bidens, stating: \u201cIt had nothing to do with a quid pro quo.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com National-Security Trump-Ordered-Hold-On-Military-Aid-Days-Before-Calling-Ukrainian-President-Officials-Say"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
