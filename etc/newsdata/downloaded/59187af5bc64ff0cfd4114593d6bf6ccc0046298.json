Incredible, isn\u2019t it. But we can fix that by flipping Virginia\u2019s state legislature on November 5th. If we flip two seats in each chamber, we can become the 38th and final state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.\u201d\n\nLouis-Dreyfus continued:\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough, census and redistricting are around the corner, so turning Virginia blue can help prevent gerrymandering for a decade.
