An event at conference tells me the Tories don\u2019t care | Sayeeda Warsi", "language": "en", "text": "Seven years ago I was chairman of the Conservative party. At the time, under the leadership of David Cameron, it felt like an organisation that was striving to become more diverse and more inclusive, and one that was taking steps to improve the representation and influence of people from different backgrounds. Cameron told me he wanted to change the face of the party, and the faces within the party.\n\nHow things have changed. We now have a leadership that openly demonises Muslim women, fails to acknowledge the extent of racism within the party\u2019s ranks, and uses language over Brexit that stokes hatred and deepens divisions. And this weekend, in Manchester, we had a meeting at the party conference that brought out the worst aspects of this atmosphere of intolerance.\n\nWe are no further along the road in dealing with the bigotry and racism within our ranks\n\nHeadlined as Challenging \u201cIslamophobia\u201d, at first glance it seemed to be the kind of event I could sign up to: who wouldn\u2019t want to support minorities under attack? But then I noticed that some of the panellists had at times said, let us say, dubious things about Muslims.\n\nI immediately raised my concerns with the MP Nusrat Ghani, who was also billed as a panellist. I asked her why the party conference would be hosting an event dominated by such people. She assured me it would be balanced, and that the speakers would be challenged. But it now appears that exactly what I\u2019d feared has happened and that the meeting became a Muslim-bashing fest. I am appalled at both its content and its conduct.\n\nTrevor Phillips, the chair, opened the event by telling Muslims what they should be concerned about. The conversation then majored on Muslim extremists, Islamists, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt. From sharia to burqas, terrorism to misogyny, the panellists emphasised anything but the real lived experiences of British Muslims. Finally, he told the panellists they had \u201c30 seconds on whether we should have a definition and an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party\u201d. \u201cVery briefly,\u201d he then emphasised.\n\nI now realise why the event\u2019s headline had quotation marks. It wasn\u2019t a meeting to challenge Islamophobia, but to challenge the very concept of it \u2013 suggesting it to be a dangerous, concocted idea being \u201cweaponised\u201d by extremists and a tool to shut down criticism of Islam. It ignored the harrowing tales of discrimination and prejudice I\u2019d heard from victims as part of the parliamentary report Islamophobia Defined.\n\nWhen I first read reports on the gathering, I felt sick to my stomach at what went on. Later, as I listened to a recording of the event, I felt deep fear.\n\nFear that a mainstream party has so lost its way that it would host such an event. Fear at the disingenuous way the Islamophobia report was presented, with no parliamentarian involved in producing it given a chance to respond. But, most particularly, fear at the manner in which British Muslims who dared question this panto of an event were treated.\n\nA party member of 37 years who introduced himself as proudly Conservative, Muslim and British, said: \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out whether [the panellists] are here to tackle Islamophobia rather than promote it \u2013 I\u2019m struggling to understand.\u201d Another young man from Hull tried to give examples of Islamophobia but was shut down. It made for disturbing listening. Being named \u201cIslamophobe of the year\u201d was joked about by panellists as if it were a badge to be worn with pride.\n\nConservative members suspended for online Islamophobia Read more\n\nEven more disturbing was how the panel tried to shore up their anti-racism credentials by denouncing antisemitism within the Labour party. It was the worst kind of hypocrisy. I thought this terrible playing of \u201crace politics\u2019 was confined to the divide-and-rule practices of the colonial past. I have been raising the issue of Islamophobia within my party for nearly four years and have often been asked whether it is \u201cas bad as Labour antisemitism\u201d. I have refused to engage in this debate, because those who do are no friends of any minority. I will not play \u201cMuslim victimhood\u201d versus \u201cJewish victimhood\u201d or any other form of racism \u2013 those of us who truly care about equality believe all need protection.\n\nPhilip Hammond, the former chancellor, described the Conservatives recently as \u201can extreme rightwing faction\u201d; the MP Sam Gyimah said he felt \u201can outcast\u201d in an increasingly intolerant party. I have personally tried to battle on, painstakingly presenting complaints, citing hundreds of incidents of Islamophobia as evidence, yet despite Boris Johnson\u2019s public promise of an inquiry we are no further along the road in dealing with the bigotry and racism within our ranks. Sunday\u2019s meeting was disingenuous, divisive and peppered with dog whistles. Maybe it\u2019s time to acknowledge that it was very suited to today\u2019s Tory party.\n\n\u2022 Lady Warsi is a former chairman of the Conservative party", "description": "The party I chaired once worked to improve diversity.
