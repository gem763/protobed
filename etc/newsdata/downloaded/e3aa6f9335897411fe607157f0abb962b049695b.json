The question is: will he be able to get to her before it\u2019s too late?\n\nMartin Fowler\u2019s (James Bye) return to the Square provides Ben with plenty to think about in the coming episodes. The fruit-and-veg stall holder absconded from Walford several months back after Stacey (Lacey Turner) whacked Phil (Steve McFadden) over the head and left him for dead in The Arches.\n\nAlthough Ben is very much aware of the Fowlers\u2019 role in his dad\u2019s hospitalisation, he allowed them to get away with it scot free so that he could frame Keanu (Danny Walters), but Ben held on to the wrench that Stacey used to bludgeon his dad, which leaves Martin at his beck and call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartin returns home after getting wind that Bex (Jasmine Armfield) attempted to take her own life, but \u2014 upon agreeing to stick around \u2014 he pays Ben a visit and pleads with him to allow Stacey to return to the Square.\n\nBen comptemplates everything that Martin has said, but \u2014 before he can give him an answer \u2014 he gets a threatening call from Jags (Amar Adatia), who reveals that he\u2019s kidnapped Lola. Desperate and out of options, Ben offers Martin an olive branch, telling him that if he helps him to get Lola back, he\u2019ll wipe the slate clean in return.\n\nWill Martin agree?\n\nIf so, will Ben manage to save Lola before time runs out?\n\nOne to watch: Tuesday 8th October at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Ben resorts to drastic measures to save Lola \u2014 but will his plan work?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/18660708-low_res-eastenders-october-december-2019-1335_1570312664.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
