Kieran Trippier drinks from Atletico Madrid fan's bottle during draw with Celta Vigo", "language": "en", "text": "Kieran Trippier enjoyed a mid-game drink from a fan's water bottle during Atletico Madrid's goalless draw with Celta Vigo on Saturday.\n\nThe right back was preparing to take a corner-kick when the referee halted play so an opposition player could receive treatment for an injury.\n\nTrippier seized his chance to have a drink and gestured to the nearby water boy for a bottle before a supporter came to his rescue.\n\nTrippier asks a ball boy for a bottle of water during a break in Atletico's clash with Celta Vigo\n\nThe right back then catches a water bottle thrown from the crowd by an Atletico Madrid fan\n\nTrippier downed several gulps from the bottle to the delight of the nearby home supporters\n\nThe 29-year-old threw the bottle back to the supporter in the stands before the game resumed\n\nA middle-aged man could be seen shouting towards Trippier before the right back turned around and gratefully accepted the bottle thrown to him from the stands.\n\nThe England international then took a large gulp as he waited near the corner flag and then threw the bottle back into the stands, much to the delight of the nearby fans.\n\nUnfortunately, the 29-year-old's mid-game pit stop couldn't help Atletico to victory as they played out a disappointing 0-0 draw with Celta Vigo.\n\nTrippier has quickly endeared himself to Atletico fans after making an impressive start to life in the Spanish capital, which has seen him start all five of their league games this term.\n\nThe defender delivered a fine assist for Hector Herrera's injury-time equaliser against Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday as Atletico came back from two goals down to draw 2-2.\n\nSaturday's draw with Celta comes on the back of a 3-2 defeat to Eibar last weekend, meaning Diego Simeone's side are now level on points with Granada and Sevilla at the top of La Liga.\n\nAttention now turns to the Madrid derby against bitter rivals Real next weekend.", "description": "The right back accepted a bottle of water thrown to him from the stands during a break in play and took several large gulps before throwing it back to its owner during Atletico's draw with Celta Vigo.", "authors": ["Alec Fenn For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/22/10/18780804-0-image-a-11_1569145254618.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
