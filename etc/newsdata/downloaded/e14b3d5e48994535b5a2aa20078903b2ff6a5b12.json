Biden and the Democratic Party in order to get on Mr. Trump\u2019s good side, according to documents made public Thursday.\n\nThe whistleblower has roiled Washington for more than a week, sparking charges of illegal cover-up at the White House and prompting House Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry that many of them hope will end with the president\u2019s ouster.\n\nIn dramatic testimony to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire rebutted allegations of a cover-up, saying he provided a copy of the complaint to Congress as quickly as possible.\n\nBut he called the whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u201cunprecedented,\u201d and even without the accusations of a cover-up, it was political dynamite.\n\n\u201cI have received information from multiple U.S. government officials that the president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election. This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the president\u2019s main domestic political rivals,\u201d the complaint said.\n\nAt issue was a July phone call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where the U.S. leader asked his counterpart to investigate business deals struck by Hunter Biden, a son of one of the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nAccording to a White House transcript, Mr. Trump did ask for an investigation and asked Ukraine to try to figure out what happened to a Democratic National Committee computer server that U.S. prosecutors say was hacked by Russian operatives meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe transcript does not suggest a quid pro quo, but the whistleblower says Ukrainian officials thought it did.\n\nThe whistleblower said Ukrainian leaders went into the call believing they had to \u201cplay ball\u201d on Mr. Trump\u2019s pet issues, and a readout of the call posted online by Mr. Zelensky\u2019s office says the lack of investigation hindered U.S.-Ukrainian relations.\n\nThe whistleblower says U.S. officials met with Ukrainian counterparts the day after the call to give advice on \u201chow to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the president had made of Mr. Zelensky.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower acknowledged the information wasn\u2019t firsthand but said it was from so many people and the stories matched so well that he felt compelled to pass it on.\n\nThe New York Times reported Thursday that the whistleblower was likely a CIA analyst who had been detailed to the White House and was probably a specialist on Ukraine.\n\nThe whistleblower filed the complaint with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general six weeks ago. Inspector General Michael K. Atkinson determined that while the complainant had a bias against Mr. Trump, the claims were credible and urgent. Under the law, that meant the complaint should be shared with Congress quickly, the inspector general said.\n\nMr. Maguire said it wasn\u2019t that simple. He asked for a ruling from the Justice Department, which said that because the call was a diplomatic communication outside the intelligence sphere, it didn\u2019t trigger the congressional notification law.\n\nHe said the Ukraine call raised executive privilege questions for the White House, and it wasn\u2019t until the president waived that privilege this week that he was able to share the complaint with Congress.\n\nHe forcefully rejected Democratic accusations that he was attempting to shield Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIt was not stonewalling. I did not receive direction from anybody,\u201d said Mr. Maguire.\n\nHe said it was the first time he had been accused of such action in 40 years of military and intelligence service. \u201cI have to comply with the way the law is, not the way some people would like it to be,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe White House did not \u2014 did not \u2014 direct me to withhold information,\u201d he added.\n\nThat seemed to undercut Democrats\u2019 cover-up accusation \u2014 though they quickly switched to focusing on the whistleblower complaint itself.\n\n\u201cI think there are any number of potential crimes when a president is soliciting for an assistance again in another presidential election,\u201d said Rep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat and chairman of the intelligence committee.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, said the whistleblower\u2019s complaint is now the focus of impeachment efforts.\n\nMr. Trump, returning from New York where he had been meeting with world leaders at the United Nations headquarters, said the Democrats \u201care going to lose the election and they know it,\u201d and that their impeachment lust was hurting the country more than it was hurting him.\n\n\u201cThere should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to tie up our country.\u201d\n\nHe suggested those who leaked were traitors.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nThose comments drew a rebuke from top House Democrats \u2014 Mr. Schiff; Rep. Eliot L. Engel of New York, who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee; and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee \u2014 who said Mr. Trump was chilling whistleblowers and obstructing their investigations because he was threatening the very people they want to talk to.\n\n\u201cOur nation\u2019s laws prohibit efforts to discourage, intimidate, or otherwise pressure a witness not to provide testimony to Congress,\u201d they warned in a joint statement.\n\nMr. Trump defended his call with the Ukrainian president as \u201cabsolutely perfect.\u201d\n\nEven some fellow Republicans weren\u2019t buying that.\n\n\u201cI want to say to the president, \u2018This is not OK,\u201d said Rep. Michael R. Turner, Ohio Republican and a member of the intelligence panel.\n\nBut he said that as \u201cdisappointing\u201d as Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior was, it was not what the whistleblower suggested.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s clear about the complaint is it\u2019s based on political issues,\u201d Mr. Turner said.\n\nDemocrats said what they saw from the transcript only boosted their confidence in the whistleblower.\n\nMr. Schiff said his committee will want to speak to a number of people, including some of the unidentified officials the whistleblower said provided the information, in order to advance the Democrats\u2019 investigation. Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s top aides also could be targets for the inquiry.\n\n\u201cWe want to know what role Rudy Giuliani had in all of this. We what to know what role [Attorney General] Bill Barr had in any of this. We want to know what Ukraine understood was expected of them before they even had this July 25 phone call with the president,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.\n\nOff Capitol Hill, it\u2019s not clear what the next steps are. Mr. Maguire said now that the key parts of the complaint are public, the inspector general could pursue the matter.\n\nIn the complaint, the whistleblower suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine may violate U.S. campaign finance laws by trying to enlist a foreign government to aid his reelection.\n\nBut the Justice Department this week said it had already investigated the call, based solely on the information in the transcript, and concluded there were no violations of campaign laws because it was not clear that what Mr. Trump was asking for had a quantifiable value.\n\nAfter the House hearing Thursday, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence heard from Mr. Maguire and from the inspector general.\n\nThe top Republican and Democrat on that committee emerged to say their investigators have plenty of leads to follow over the next two weeks while Congress in recess.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t expect us to move at light speed. That will probably happen in the House. We are committed to getting to the bottom of what questions we have,\u201d said committee Chairman Richard Burr, North Carolina Republican.\n\nThe Senate committee did its work Thursday behind closed doors.\n\nMr. Maguire, during his public testimony to the House, appeared to take a swipe at the lower chamber\u2019s more public approach, saying it was a distraction for the government\u2019s national security professionals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite sure that for at least two hours this morning there are not many people in the intelligence community who are doing anything that\u2019s productive besides watching this,\u201d said the director of national intelligence.\n\n\u2981 Dave Boyer and S.A.
