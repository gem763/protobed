Large crowds of mostly office workers blocked roads in the heart of the commercial district.\n\nSome protesters tore down pro-China banners before clashes erupted throughout the evening. Police used tear gas in multiple locations to disperse protesters who had taken over roads, vandalised subway stations, set street fires and trashed pro-China businesses.\n\nIn the northern district of Yuen Long, a police officer opened fire when he was surrounded in his car and attacked by protesters, a petrol bomb exploding at his feet.\n\n\"A large group of rioters attacked a plainclothes police officer in Yuen Long district. The police officer fell onto the ground and was beaten up by the group. Facing serious threat to his life, he fired one shot in self-defence,\" police said in a statement.\n\nAlso in Yuen Long, a teenage boy was shot and wounded by a live round, the South China Morning Post reported, citing a medical source. It was unclear if that round was linked to the plainclothes officer who opened fire.\n\nThe entire subway network was suspended, leaving protesters, locals and Friday night revellers stranded.\n\nAs the city awoke on Saturday, train services remained in lockdown - including the airport line - with the rail operator saying it would assess damage to stations before deciding when to reopen lines.\n\n'WATERSHED'\n\nBeijing described the ban as \"extremely necessary\".\n\n\"The current chaos in Hong Kong cannot continue indefinitely,\" Yang Guang, spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China's central government, said in a statement.\n\n\"An important moment has come for stopping the violence with a clearer attitude and more effective measures,\" he added.\n\nCritics said Ms Lam's move was a major step towards authoritarianism for Hong Kong, which has been governed by China under a \"one country, two systems\" framework since British colonial rule ended in 1997.\n\n\"This is a watershed. This is a Rubicon,\" pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo told AFP.\n\n\"And I'm worried this could be just a starter. More draconian bans in the name of law could be lurking around the corner.\"\n\nProminent democracy activist Joshua Wong said the law \"marks the beginning of the end of Hong Kong\".\n\n\"It is ironic that a colonial-era weapon is being used by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Communist Party,\" he told AFP.\n\nThe emergency law was last invoked during riots in 1967.\n\nIn the United States, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, at which Wong testified last month, said that using the emergency powers \"will not address the grievances underlying four months of protests\".\n\nThe powerful US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi separately said the ban \"only intensifies concerns about freedom of expression\".\n\nAVOIDING IDENTIFICATION\n\nHong Kong's protests were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions to the mainland, which fuelled fears of an erosion of liberties promised under \"one country, two systems\".\n\nAfter Beijing and local leaders took a hard line, the demonstrations snowballed into a wider movement calling for more democratic freedoms and police accountability.\n\nProtesters have used face masks to avoid identification and respirators to protect themselves from tear gas.\n\nThe ban came after the worst violence of the year, when China celebrated 70 years of Communist Party rule on Tuesday. During those clashes, an officer shot and wounded a teenager - the first such shooting since the demonstrations began.\n\nThe new law threatens anyone wearing masks at protests with up to one year in prison.\n\nFor one of those at Friday's march, the ban would not solve the city's woes.\n\n\"Youngsters are risking their lives,\" a 34-year-old office worker wearing a surgical mask, who gave her first name as Mary, told AFP.\n\n\"They don't mind being jailed for 10 years, so wearing masks is not a problem.\"\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HONG KONG] Hong Kong's entire mass transit rail system was suspended on Saturday after a night of violence sparked by a ban on pro-democracy protesters wearing face masks, as the government imposed emergency powers not used in more than half a century. .
