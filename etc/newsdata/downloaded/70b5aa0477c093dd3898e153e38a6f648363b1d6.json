Simpson Was 'Emotional'", "language": "en", "text": "Kim Kardashian revealed that things got \u201cemotional\u201d the last time that she and her sisters saw their old family friend, O.J. Simpson, at a nightclub in Miami.\n\nKardashian said she was in Florida with sisters Kourtney and Khloe when they ran into the former NFL star, who was acquitted in the 1994 murders of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman, and later served nine years in prison for a 2007 Las Vegas hotel room robbery.\n\n\u201cIt was before he had gone to jail this last situation, and Khlo\u00e9 and, I think me Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 were in Miami in a club, and we ran into him in the VIP section,\u201d Kardashian said during an episode of her friend Jonathan Cheban\u2019s \u201cFoodGod\u201d podcast, posted Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe all, I think, all started crying. It was emotional,\u201d she added.\n\nKardashian\u2019s father, the late Robert Kardashian, was a member of Simpson\u2019s defense team during the murder trial and the family once was close to him.\n\n\u201cHis kids are all so amazing and Nicole\u2019s kids, and I\u2019m still somewhat friendly with his children,\u201d Kardashian told Cheban.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really talk to them, but I did connect with his son a few years back and I just have respect for them, and their lives must be extremely hard to really go through that,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo, I always try to keep to myself on that issue and not bring anything up for them.\u201d\n\nAmy Sussman via Getty Images Kardashian attends the 2019 Creative Arts Emmy Awards on Sept. 14, in Los Angeles.\n\nKardashian said she knows firsthand how hurtful it can be when once-close friends give out personal information.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than someone you knew from your childhood just starts talking about your life,\u201d Kardashian shared. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that happen with people that have been close to us, and they start talking about us as kids and they really don\u2019t know us now. It gets so frustrating.\u201d\n\nSimpson took to Twitter in June to deny a longstanding rumor that he is Khloe Kardashian\u2019s real father.\n\n\u201cBob Kardashian was like a brother to me, he was a great guy,\u201d O.J. said in a bizarre, two-minute video, referring to the Kardashian family patriarch, who was married to Kris Jenner before splitting in 1991. Bob Kardashian died in 2003.\n\n\u201cKhloe, like all the girls I\u2019m very proud of, just like I know Bob would be if he was here, but the simple facts of the matter is she\u2019s not mine,\u201d Simpson added.\n\nThe first thing I want to set straight is this story Pardo (who was not my manger) is talking about all over the media regarding me & @KrisJenner pic.twitter.com/tZ9EJd4qxF \u2014 O.J.
