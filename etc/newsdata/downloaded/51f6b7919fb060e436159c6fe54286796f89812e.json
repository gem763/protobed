Which is why it struck an odd note for many to see his campaign bring on board one of the more establishment Democratic ad consultancies in the business deep into his current run.\n\nOn Wednesday, Politico reported that the Yang campaign was hiring the firm Devine, Mulvey, and Longabaugh to help with media consulting. The firm has, for years, worked with a slate of Democratic candidates on federal and state races. But it\u2019s best known for its work on Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign, on which Tad Devine\u2014one of the firm\u2019s namesakes\u2014served as a senior adviser.\n\nBoth Devine and the firm were set to reprise their roles in 2020. But they ended up not joining the Sanders election effort after what was described as strategic difference. In reality, the decision was largely driven by the belief within Sanders\u2019 orbit that they could save money\u2014and do a better job coordinating messages\u2014if they simply produced their ads in house.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen reporting that suggests they quit,\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThey did not quit; Senator Sanders never brought them on.\u201d\n\nShakir said that the firm also approached the campaign a second time to see if there was a role to play but that the senator declined their offer. Instead, the campaign followed through on its plan to do in-house production, with the latest of their spots coming this week after Sanders\u2019 mega-rally in New York City.\n\nThat Devine, Mulvey, and Longabaugh moved on makes sense, considering how large the Democratic field remains and how much work there is to grab from those still in it. But why the firm went with Yang\u2014who has no real institutional ties to the Democratic Party\u2014is less clear. A request for comment from both the campaign and Devine were not returned.\n\n\u201cWe wish them the best, and appreciate the good work they did on the last campaign,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cOur in-house team is producing such great work. I\u2019m sure the consulting class is a little worried about this approach being successful.\u201d", "description": "The unconventional 2020 candidate brought on the media firm best known for its work on Bernie\u2019s 2016 bid.", "authors": ["Sam Stein", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2427,w_4316,x_0,y_99/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571866394/RTS2QCFL_va8v6d", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
