As of late Wednesday, 218 House members say they support an impeachment inquiry \u2014 enough for a simple majority. Not one is a Republican.\n\nTrump offered Ukrainian president Justice Dept. help in an investigation of Biden, memo shows\n\nBut Biden said the ongoing saga, which is largely centered around unfounded allegations that he and his son committed wrongdoings in Ukraine, won\u2019t distract from his campaign to win the Democratic presidential nomination and challenge Trump in 2020.\n\n\u201cI am confident in the ability of the House and Senate to deal with this,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy job is to go out and flat beat him.\u201d\n\nThe roughly 16-minute interview kicked off Wednesday night with host Jimmy Kimmel jokingly asking Biden if there was \u201canything going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot much at all, just Rudy and Donald,\u201d Biden responded, referencing Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. In recent days, the pair repeated allegations about Biden and his son Hunter that have not been supported by any official evidence thus far, according to The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker. A Tuesday report from The Post identified Giuliani as a key player in Ukraine dealings.\n\nGiuliani pursued shadow Ukraine agenda as key foreign policy officials were sidelined\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one single solitary legitimate journalist in the world giving any credibility to this,\u201d Biden said Wednesday, echoing comments he made to reporters on Tuesday in Wilmington, Del.\n\nStill, Biden didn\u2019t hesitate to join Kimmel in throwing shade at Trump and Giuliani. On the \u201coutlandish scale,\u201d Biden said Wednesday he would rank the previous 48 hours an \u201c18 out of 10.\u201d\n\n\u201cHard to believe he was mayor of New York at one time and seemed to be doing an okay job,\u201d Kimmel said of Giuliani. \u201cIt\u2019s like his body has been taken over by another being.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the president could do that,\u201d Biden quipped.\n\nThen, the conversation shifted to the day\u2019s biggest story: the Ukraine transcript and impeachment.\n\nUnlike his fellow Democratic presidential hopefuls, Biden has shied away from full-throated calls to begin the impeachment process, The Post reported. But on Wednesday, after the release of the rough transcript, he suggested his position has shifted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a blatant abuse of power,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it can stand.\"\n\nBiden, in cautious comments, stops shy of calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment now\n\nBiden, however, stressed that there is \u201cmuch more at stake\u201d than Trump \u201cacting so bizarrely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t let this distract me in a way that takes me away from the issues that really are the reason why I\u2019m running,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to restore the soul of this country \u2014 who we are, our values.\u201d\n\nFor the rest of the interview, Biden focused on his campaign, reiterating how his decision to run was sparked by Charlottesville and the president\u2019s infamous claim that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d at the violent rally, and what could happen to the U.S. if Trump is reelected.\n\n\u201cThis division in our country is just so devastating, so devastating for so many people, and it\u2019s ruining our standing around the world,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe can probably handle four years if he doesn\u2019t get us into a war in the next year \u2026 I\u2019m not being glib saying that. But eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of this nation in my view. We can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\n\nBiden also continued to criticize Trump\u2019s policy on health care, the environment and gun control.\n\n\u201cI just think with him gone there\u2019s a chance to breathe new life into what everybody knows has to be done,\u201d he said.", "description": "\u201cBased on the material that they acknowledged today, it seems to me it\u2019s awful hard to avoid the conclusion that it is an impeachable offense and a violation of constitutional responsibility,\u201d Biden said Wednesday during an appearance on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WnmFoNF9dzZ_dslQLOZ5APeuIAY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MR7TVF325RGIJMO3DSN2VSTFVU.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
