A new study casts doubt on this, however, arguing that Beijing doesn\u2019t have the military power to defeat its neighbors. In fact, it probably can\u2019t even conquer Taiwan.\n\nA study published several years ago by Michael Beckley, an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Tufts University, was published in the academic journal International Security. In the article, Beckley argues that China\u2019s neighbors could thwart Chinese military aggression through anti-access/area denial strategies with only minimal U.S. assistance.\n\n\u201cMy main finding is that there is a budding balance of military power in East Asia, which the United States can reinforce at moderate risk to U.S. forces,\u201d Beckley writes in the article. \u201cFurthermore, this balance of power will remain stable for years to come, because China cannot afford the power-projection capabilities it would need to overcome the A2/AD forces of its neighbors. The main reasons are that power projection forces are more expensive than A2/AD forces by an order of magnitude.\u201d\n\nA2/AD is most commonly discussed in relation to China\u2019s efforts to deny America the ability to intervene in any regional conflict or make it so costly that Washington is deterred from doing so. Some observers, including James Holmes, Toshi Yoshihara and Andrew Krepinevich, have argued that the United States and its Asian allies should this strategy around on China. Instead of seeking to maintain command of the sea and air as America has traditionally done, these scholars suggest Washington and its allies could simply seek to deny China the ability to achieve its goals. As Beckley puts it, \u201cUnder this strategy, the United States would abandon efforts to command maritime East Asia and, instead, focus on helping China\u2019s neighbors deny China sea and air control in the region.\n\nBeckley\u2019s main contribution is to test the viability of this strategy for a number of foreseeable conflict scenarios. One of these, of course, is a Chinese invasion of the Taiwan strait. While amphibious invasions have always been the most difficult military maneuver to pull off, they are especially difficult in an era of precision-guided munitions that can pick off an invading force while they are still at sea.\n\nTo have any chance of successfully invading Taiwan, then, China would have to establish total air superiority and command of the sea in the area. As Beckley explains, \u201cIf Taiwan retained substantial air defenses and offensive strike platforms, a Chinese amphibious invasion would be impossible, because Taiwan could pick off PLA landing craft as they motored across the Taiwan Strait.and sea command in the strait.\u201d Although China has amassed an incredibly large missile force to destroy Taiwan\u2019s defensive capabilities at the outset of a conflict, it would still need to take Taipei by total surprise to be successful. If Taiwan had some advanced warning of an attack, it could disperse its aircraft to some thirty-six military airfield across the islands, while also relying on a number of civilian aistrips and even some highways that double as emergency air bases. Taiwan also has a bunch of road-mobile missile launchers and anti-aircraft weaponry, as well as a number of ships and submarines capable of attacking Chinese forces with cruise missiles.\n\nAs Beckley points out, there is little reason to believe that China would be able to knock out all of these defenses in a surprise first strike. To begin with, Taiwan has sophisticated early warning air defense systems. Moreover, the United States has not even been able to achieve this level of destruction against much lesser enemies like Iraq during the First Gulf War or Serbia in 1999.\n\nBut if China was far more successful than the United States had been in those conflicts, Beijing\u2019s ability to execute an amphibious invasion is still far from certain. For instance, Beckley notes that only ten percent of Taiwan\u2019s coastlines are suitable for an amphibious landing, which would allow Taipei to concentrate its forces on a few key areas. Chinese forces trying to land would likely be severely outnumbered.", "description": "A\u00a0study published several years ago by Michael Beckley, an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Tufts University,\u00a0was published\u00a0in the academic journal\u00a0International Security.
