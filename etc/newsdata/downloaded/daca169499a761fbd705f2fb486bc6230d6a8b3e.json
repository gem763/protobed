A huge shock for Jodie to win (though very well deserved!) and so nice to see women supporting women. #Emmys \u2014 Elizabeth Wagmeister (@EWagmeister) September 23, 2019\n\nJODIE COMER AND SANDRA OH ALSO KNOWN AS THE MOST PRECIOUS HUMANS #emmys pic.twitter.com/JJzWFriddw \u2014 berry (@sckberry) September 23, 2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say, Sandra, that this \u2018Killing Eve\u2019 journey has been an absolute whirlwind and I feel so lucky to have shared the whole experience with you,\u201d Comer, who portrays the conniving assassin Villanelle, said in her acceptance speech.\n\nThe award marks Comer\u2019s first Emmy win. This is the second consecutive year that Oh, who plays MI6 agent Eve Polastri, has been nominated in the category. She also received five nods for her role as Dr. Cristina Yang on \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d If she had won this year, Oh would have become the first actress of Asian descent ever to win that category. But she didn\u2019t seem bummed about her loss.\n\nFriendship goals, y\u2019all.\n\nJodie Comer wins lead actress in a drama series and I am here for the love between her, co-star #SandraOh, and creator #PhoebeWallerBridge. #Emmys pic.twitter.com/IB3TvQyn2Q \u2014 Nancy Wang Yuen (@nancywyuen) September 23, 2019", "description": "Comer, who stars alongside Oh in \"Killing Eve,\" took home the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.", "authors": ["Asian-American Affairs Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8834d82300009b05d4ae48.jpeg?cache=d7opkoqh1r&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
