REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic Senator Edward Markey raised concerns on Thursday that law enforcement use of Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Ring doorbell camera in investigations could disproportionately affect people of color and encourage racial profiling.\n\nIn a letter to Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, Markey said sharing information from Ring\u2019s at-home camera systems with police departments \u201ccould easily create a surveillance network that places dangerous burdens on people of color\u201d and stoke \u201cracial anxieties\u201d in communities where it works with law enforcement.\n\nMarkey, the ranking member on the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Security, said he was \u201calarmed to learn that Ring is pursuing facial recognition technology\u201d and that Amazon was marketing its facial recognition technology Rekognition to police departments.\n\nRing declined to comment.\n\nFacial recognition technology has been shown to disproportionately misidentify people of color. In a 2018 American Civil Liberties Union study, Rekognition incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress, including Markey, to a database of 25,000 publicly available arrest photos.\n\nMarkey cited civil liberties concerns about \u201ccountless bystanders who may be unaware that they are being filmed\u201d by Ring cameras.\n\nRing products include at-home camera surveillance systems and a social network called Neighbors for users to share and discuss footage captured on its cameras.\n\nMarkey asked Bezos for a list of all law enforcement entities with access to Ring footage, and for the company\u2019s plans to add facial recognition technology.", "description": "U.S. Democratic Senator Edward Markey raised concerns on Thursday that law enforcement use of Amazon.com Inc's Ring doorbell camera in investigations could disproportionately affect people of color and encourage racial profiling.", "authors": ["Bryan Pietsch", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426738794&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8421I-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
