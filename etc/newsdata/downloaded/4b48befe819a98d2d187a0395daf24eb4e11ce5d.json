But these grinning men were someone\u2019s brother, son, husband, father. They were human beings, people who took immense pleasure in the utter cruelty of torturing others to death\u2014and were so proud of doing so that they posed for photographs with their handiwork, jostling to ensure they caught the eye of the lens, so that the world would know they\u2019d been there. Their cruelty made them feel good, it made them feel proud, it made them feel happy. And it made them feel closer to one another.\n\nThe Trump era is such a whirlwind of cruelty that it can be hard to keep track. This week alone, the news broke that the Trump administration was seeking to ethnically cleanse more than 193,000 American children of immigrants whose temporary protected status had been revoked by the administration, that the Department of Homeland Security had lied about creating a database of children that would make it possible to unite them with the families the Trump administration had arbitrarily destroyed, that the White House was considering a blanket ban on visas for Chinese students, and that it would deny visas to the same-sex partners of foreign officials. At a rally in Mississippi, a crowd of Trump supporters cheered as the president mocked Christine Blasey Ford, the psychology professor who has said that Brett Kavanaugh, whom Trump has nominated to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, attempted to rape her when she was a teenager. \u201cLock her up!\u201d they shouted.\n\nFord testified to the Senate, utilizing her professional expertise to describe the encounter, that one of the parts of the incident she remembered most was Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge laughing at her as Kavanaugh fumbled at her clothing. \u201cIndelible in the hippocampus is the laughter,\u201d Ford said, referring to the part of the brain that processes emotion and memory, \u201cthe uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense.\u201d And then at Tuesday\u2019s rally, the president made his supporters laugh at her.\n\nFurther reading: The most striking thing about Trump\u2019s mockery of Christine Blasey Ford\n\nEven those who believe that Ford fabricated her account, or was mistaken in its details, can see that the president\u2019s mocking of her testimony renders all sexual-assault survivors collateral damage. Anyone afraid of coming forward, afraid that she would not be believed, can now look to the president to see her fears realized. Once malice is embraced as a virtue, it is impossible to contain.\n\nThe cruelty of the Trump administration\u2019s policies, and the ritual rhetorical flaying of his targets before his supporters, are intimately connected. As Lili Loofbourow wrote of the Kavanaugh incident in Slate, adolescent male cruelty toward women is a bonding mechanism, a vehicle for intimacy through contempt. The white men in the lynching photos are smiling not merely because of what they have done, but because they have done it together.", "description": "President Trump and his supporters find community by rejoicing in the suffering of those they hate and fear.", "authors": ["Adam Serwer", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/10/RTS23VNJ/facebook.jpg?1538599049", "published_at": "2018-10-03"}
