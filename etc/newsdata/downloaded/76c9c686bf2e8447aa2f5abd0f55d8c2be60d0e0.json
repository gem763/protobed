Despite taking great pleasure from his podcast and television series, he says, \u201cat the end of the day I\u2019m a book writer, and I have to make room for that at all times.\u201d Over coffee, we talked about his many projects \u2014 and how he manages to do them all.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n(This interview has been edited for length and clarity).\n\nQ: In your podcast \u201cMurder Book,\u201d you followed a real cold case that involved a killing in Hollywood in which the suspect was brought to trial many years later, and you went to the court to follow the story toward its conclusion. First, why do a podcast? And second, how did it play into your new novel?\n\nA: To me, the podcast is hopefully an entertaining story that also is illuminating about our cracked system. And the case was in part chosen because it involved three detectives who have helped me the most in my books. I was able to get the voices of people who have inspired me \u2014 and I could get them to tell their story, rather than me fictionalize it in a Bosch book. On the second level, it\u2019s about how I do my research. The podcast was me doing research on wiretaps.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQ: Wiretaps and DNA both figure into the podcast and \u201cThe Night Fire,\u201d but not exactly the way you\u2019d expect.\n\nA: I think that\u2019s my duty as a novelist, to take things that seem established \u2014 DNA is seen, probably, as the panacea to solving all kinds of crimes, and there\u2019s just a lot more to it than that. So I will purposely look for ways of flipping the convention of what most people will think. In \u201cThe Night Fire\u201d there\u2019s a dead-bang case with a confession and a DNA match, and you can knock down both of them if your lawyer is smart.\n\nQ: How does the TV show \u201cBosch\u201d affect how you think about your novels?\n\nA: Before the show, most of the Bosch books were the single narrative \u2014 they\u2019re in his head. And you don\u2019t have that in scripting. One of the first things [the producers] said was, Bosch can\u2019t be in every scene or we\u2019re going to kill the poor guy. We have to spread the story around to other characters, to give them more life. Most of my books since then have had multiple narrators. I\u2019ve spread the storytelling out in my books as well.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQ: How do Harry Bosch and Ren\u00e9e Ballard let you make different kinds of storytelling choices?\n\nA: It\u2019s a perfect setup because one has a badge and one doesn\u2019t, so one can do things the other one can\u2019t. But also, Bosch has always been a guy who will go up to a line and put one foot across but not both, but Ballard\u2019s all-in. In all the years I wrote about Bosch as a cop he didn\u2019t do that, and now I\u2019m writing about someone who did \u2014 who does. Ballard is ruled by the greater good as opposed to the protocols of the police department.\n\nQ: Is it fun working on a television show?\n\nA: Well it\u2019s fun if you wrote the books it\u2019s based on. Because you\u2019re kind of like the unofficial mayor of a little town. The crew\u2019s like 250 people. And it hits me every time. Sometimes we\u2019ll do a scene and I can remember writing that scene in a book, and just crazy to think when I was writing that, I had no idea that 20 years later they would actually film this. It\u2019s been a great ride. I\u2019m very lucky.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQ: You\u2019re considering stories for another season of the podcast, you\u2019re going on book tour, you\u2019re writing a script for \u201cBosch\u201d while shooting a different episode, and you\u2019re working on a new novel. How do you do it all?\n\nA: When I write a novel, I get an idea and I think about it, sometimes for years, sometimes very quickly. But I don\u2019t start writing until I have a sense of how it\u2019s going to end. I need that light to go toward. And once I have that light, I can jump off and do something else and come back to it.\n\nIt may have come from my days as a newspaper reporter, because on the crime beat you usually write about something that happened, but it doesn\u2019t have a conclusion yet, so you have many things that you want to keep checking on. You have a lot of balls in the air when you\u2019re a police reporter. I have a lot of balls in the air now, but I don\u2019t have daily deadlines, so what I do now is easier than what I used to do as a reporter. And I don\u2019t have the pressure of being right because I write fiction.\n\nCarolyn Kellogg is the former books editor of the Los Angeles Times.
