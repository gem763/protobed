Wearing headphones is one defense. Walking quickly with our head down is another. Humming steadily to ourselves in our very loud screaming voice is a third. And, of course, there is always the defense of showing off our \u201cresting bitch face,\u201d if we are so lucky as to have one.\n\nBut according to the New York Post, women are increasingly, allegedly, making the decision to get plastic surgery to change their \u201cresting bitch face,\u201d molding it instead into a face that seems more \u201capproachable.\u201d Dr. David Shafer, medical director of midtown\u2019s Shafer Plastic Surgery and Laser Center, told the Post, \u201cThis is actually a common request from patients \u2014 I get several each week.\u201d\n\nAccording to Shafer, requests for the anti-bitch-face procedure have more than doubled in the last year, due in part, he believes, to the Kardashians and their emphasis on the lower half of the face and in part due to selfies, which force women to \u201clook down at their phone, [which] accentuates the resting bitch face.\u201d\n\nMedical experts contacted by the Post say the more approachable face is won by injecting fillers and sometimes Botox, and it only takes about 10 to 20 minutes and costs between $500 and 5,000. \u201cThe worse the \u2018bitch face,\u2019 the more effective the Botox,\u201d Shafer said. \u201cIf you always look dumpy, or unfriendly \u2026 people are going to react to you differently.\u201d Uh-huh. Whether this is indicative of a real trend or an idea thought up by the Post I cannot tell you. What I can tell you is that I think you should please cherish your bitch face, if you are so lucky as to have one.\n\nThere exists in life the ambient idea that a woman is meant to look and be pleasant and accommodating to anyone who has decided to want pleasant accommodation. It is unfortunate. My advice would be to combat this idea whenever you can. Invite your \u201cresting bitch face.\u201d Appreciate your \u201cresting bitch face.\u201d Consider it a blessing that your \u201cresting bitch face\u201d will deter the exact sort of people who would be deterred by what they call a \u201cresting bitch face.\u201d Your bitch face is your friend. The strangers who wish you would look more pleasant are not.\n\nIf people actually need you, they\u2019ll talk to you. Otherwise they can eat shit.
