Whether it\u2019s a function of Trump\u2019s volatility or a measure of his craft, he has a knack for freezing out damaging news by creating his own news storms that transfix the press. He fires members of his Cabinet and staff, over-reaches with executive orders, picks fights with a Gold Star mother and football players, engages in ad hominem, and insults entire friendly countries.\n\nIn recent days as bad news has swelled around him, Trump has taken to screaming \u201ctreason\u201d and \u201ccoup\u201d at full volume to divert the news flow. But this time Trump\u2019s hydraulics don\u2019t seem to be working. Instead of Trump flooding the news cycle, the news cycle has begun to flood Trump. His special talents\u2014if they really exist\u2014have begun to fail him, and he seems to know it. In two recent press sprays, with the Finnish president and on the White House lawn, Trump\u2019s peach complexion has gone scarlet with rage as he dodged and parried all the bad publicity.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nYou'd go scarlet, too, if you were Trump. Democratic members of the House of Representatives have begun marshaling evidence to prove Trump committed high crimes and misdemeanors as part of the House\u2019s formal impeachment inquiry against the president. Two whistleblowers have come forward to allege abuse of power by Trump in his dealings with Ukraine\u2019s president. An IRS whistleblower has filed a complaint alleging that a political appointee at the Treasury Department attempted to interfere with the annual audit of the president or vice president\u2019s tax returns. A federal judge has ordered Trump to turn over his tax returns to the Manhattan district attorney. In recent days, three Republican senators (Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah and Ben Sasse of Nebraska) have broken ranks with their cowardly colleagues to directly criticize Trump for urging China to investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.\n\nEven the president\u2019s closest ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has turned on him. On Monday, Graham phoned into \u201cFox & Friends\u201d to denounce Trump\u2019s decision to dump the Kurds and embrace the Turks. The move is \u201cshortsighted and irresponsible\u201d as well as \u201cunnerving,\u201d Graham said, and his anger was shared by other Republican legislators. Inside the Pentagon, the brass also appeared to favor Graham\u2019s position over Trump\u2019s.\n\nAt the rate all this bad news is surging, Trump must be pining for the good old days when a new development in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation was his greatest source of grief, and a nasty blast from his Twitter feed was potent enough to repel bad tidings. But suddenly Trump\u2019s best-defense-is-a-good-offense talents are no longer sufficient to fend off the damage. In recent days, Trump has sought and failed to stall the impeachment express with tweets attacking Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., but the press has largely ignored these pathetic lines of defense. In the old days, journalists would have rushed to their keyboards to dissect the Pelosi and Schiff tweets and placed under their magnifying glass Trump\u2019s Monday tweet about the Kurds and Turks in which he referred to his own \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom.\u201d\n\nBut as the Smiths once sang, that joke isn\u2019t funny anymore. These days, the press seems more interested in charting the course of impeachment and the accumulating evidence than playing \u201cgo fetch\u201d with Trump\u2019s tweets. Not even Pat Robertson, a Trump stalwart if ever there was one, wants to follow the president on this one. Trump \u201cis in great danger of losing the mandate of Heaven\u201d if he spurns the Kurds, Robertson said.\n\nTrump\u2019s old techniques are failing\u2014and not just due to the volume of the bad news. What\u2019s unique about this phase of his presidency is that he\u2019s being attacked with so much damning information from so many directions and so many different power centers that he can\u2019t keep up. Not even a street fighter with Bruce Lee\u2019s skills could repulse this sort of pile-on.\n\nAs somebody who has never counted Trump out, I believe he could restore his good fortune with some self-discipline. Midway through the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency, columnist (and doctor of psychiatry) Charles Krauthammer took to calling the \u201cgeneral hysteria\u201d the press and the political classes expressed for the president \u201cTrump Derangement Syndrome.\u201d According to Krauthammer and others, this reflexive, partisan hatred for Trump crippled people\u2019s judgment of the man. Krauthammer urged us to stop listening to Trump\u2019s id and pay more attention to what Trump was doing and what he had done. Finally, it appears, the press and Democrats have independently taken Krauthammer\u2019s advice. As we enter impeachment autumn, the only principal still acting deranged is Trump himself.\n\n******\n\nSpeaking of the Smiths, has Morrissey done damage to the band\u2019s legacy with his politics?
