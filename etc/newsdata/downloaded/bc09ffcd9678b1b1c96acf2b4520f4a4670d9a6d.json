So, he made a video of himself in an astronaut suit slow-mo walking around the craters as the camera zooms out to reveal the deep potholes on Tunganagar Main Road in North Bengaluru. He posted this hilarious video on Twitter, tagging local civic officials, and in just a day, it got over a million hits and an overwhelming response from all those who could relate to this #tooreal woe.\n\n\n\nLooking at the overwhelming public and media response, the civic authorities had no choice but to fix the situation by filling in the potholes. Within 24 hours, the potholes were filled up, said Bengaluru civic body spokesperson LB Suresh to news agency IANS. \"Under the supervision of our chief engineer S Prabhakar, the potholes on Tunganagar main road have been filled. We responded at the earliest to the artist's complaint,\" he said.\n\nWhile the local body in-charge, known as the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagar Palike (BBMP), had announced that engineers would be fined if they failed to fill up the potholes, people continued to complain about hundreds of them making their lives miserable in the traffucked city. After working on several art installations that highlight these pesky potholes around the city, Nanjudaswamy\u2019s efforts have finally paid off.\n\nFollow Shamani Joshi on Instagram.", "description": "One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "Meera Navlakha"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6f5e4ffffff30008de1c60/lede/1567580008364-Bengaluru-civic-authorities-fill-in-potholes-after-video-of-artist-moonwalking-goes-viral.png?crop=1xw:0.8323xh;0xw,0xh&resize=1200:*"}
