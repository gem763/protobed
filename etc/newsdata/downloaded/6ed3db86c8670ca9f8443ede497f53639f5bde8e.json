(Mike Segar/Reuters)\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) criticized his former rival Hillary Clinton on Monday night over her claim that Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii) was being groomed by the Russians as a third-party candidate in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cTulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset,\u201d Sanders tweeted.\n\nHis comment came in response to Clinton\u2019s suggestion, made on former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe\u2019s podcast, that the Russians have \u201cgot their eye\u201d on Gabbard \u201cand are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.\u201d\n\nOther Democratic presidential candidates have had more muted reactions to Clinton\u2019s allegation.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg refused to condemn Clinton during a Sunday interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, insisting instead that he wanted to focus on \u201cpolicy.\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) refused to comment when asked about the controversy in Des Moines, Iowa, on Monday.\n\nAfter responding to the former secretary of state on Twitter Friday, Gabbard went on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d to further voice her thoughts on Clinton\u2019s attack.\n\n\u201cI stand against everything that she represents, and that if I\u2019m elected president, if I\u2019m the Democratic nominee and elected president, that she won\u2019t be able to control me,\u201d Gabbard told Carlson. \u201cShe won\u2019t be able to manipulate me, she won\u2019t be able to continue to work from behind the curtain, to continue these regime change wars that have been so costly.\u201d\n\nGabbard has long been an ally of Sanders, including in 2016 when she renounced her DNC vice chairwomanship to endorse Sanders over Clinton. Gabbard also has a close relationship with Nina Turner, co-chair of the Sanders campaign, with whom she has campaigned in the past. Turner tweeted Saturday morning in support of Gabbard.\n\nGood morning Sister @TulsiGabbard. I\u2019m just catching up with the foolery that\u2019s going on. I\u2019m SMDH hard. Four words: Keep. Your. Head.
