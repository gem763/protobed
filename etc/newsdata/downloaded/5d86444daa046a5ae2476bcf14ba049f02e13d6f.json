A stubborn Potapova looked as though she might return the favor but she squandered two break points as Kalinskaya put further daylight between the two.\n\nKalinskaya then broke Potapova once more to serve for the match but, although she couldn\u2019t take the chance, she prevailed in the next game.\n\nAt the end of an entertaining rally with Kalinskaya, an overstretched Potapova hit a backhand straight into the net, prompting her to immediately strike the court surface as she handed the set and match to Kalinskaya.\n\nAfter the match, Kalinskaya was straightforward in her assessment of the challenges of playing against her compatriot and friend in her post-match interview on court.\n\n\"Yes it was difficult to play in this game because we are also good friends, but someone needed to win today,\" the Moscow native said.\n\nKasatkina booked her place in the round of 16 where she will face the winner of Russia's Ekaterina Alexandrovna and Slovakian Jana \u010cepelov\u00e1.\n\nThe Kremlin Cup 2019 will serve as a homecoming for Muscovite and world no. 4 Daniil Medvedev, who on Sunday won the Shanghai Masters against last year's ATP Finals champion Alexander Zverev, his third title win in six straight tour finals.\n\nThe ATP 250 tournament, held at the city's Krylatskoye Ice Palace, will welcome perhaps the hottest player in the men's game this week, as he looks to continue his assault on the world top three.", "description": "No love was lost at the Kremlin Cup 2019 as Anna Kalinskaya, the Russian qualifier who knocked out Sloane Stevens at the US Open, dumped her friend and compatriot Anastasia Potapova out of the competition 6-0, 3-6, 6-4 on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da469b52030270a192f0e6a.png", "published_at": "2018-11-21"}
