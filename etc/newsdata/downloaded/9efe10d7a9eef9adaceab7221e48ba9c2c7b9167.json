Sales of milk-based formula have risen worldwide by 40 percent, and in upper middle-income countries such as Brazil, China and Turkey by nearly three-quarters.\n\nMissing vitamins and minerals, meanwhile, can lead to compromised immune systems, poor sight and hearing defects. A lack of iron can cause anaemia and reduced IQ.\n\n\"It's 'hidden' because you don't notice the impact until it is too late,\" Brian Keeley, editor-in-chief of report, told AFP.\n\n\"You don't notice that the child is running a little slower than everyone else, struggling a bit in school.\"\n\nThe rise of obesity, however, is plain to see.\n\nThe problem was virtually non-existent in poor countries 30 years ago, but today at least 10 percent of under five year olds are overweight or obese in three-quarters of low-income nations.\n\n\"There needs to be a focus on obesity before it is too late,\" said Keeley. \"Unless you deal with it in a preventative way, you're going to struggle to fix it later on.\"\n\nCheap, readily available junk food, often marketed directly to kids, has made the problem much worse.\n\n\"Children are eating too much of what they don't need -- salt, sugar and fat,\" Keeley added.\n\nProgress in fighting undernourishment will also be hampered by climate change, the report warned.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Tax sugary drinks -\n\n\n\n\n\nA single degree Celsius of warming since the late-19th century has amplified droughts responsible for more than 80 percent of damage and losses in agriculture.\n\nEarth's average surface temperature is set to rise another two or three degrees by 2100.\n\nResearch by scientists at Harvard University, meanwhile, have shown that the increased concentration of CO2 in the air is sapping staple food crops of those essential nutrients and vitamins, including zinc, iron and vitamin B.\n\n\"The impacts of climate change are completely transforming the food that is available and that can be consumed,\" Aguayo said.\n\nMaking sure every child has access to a healthy diet must become a \"political priority\" if widespread malnutrition is to be conquered, especially in developing countries, the report said.\n\nTaxes on sugary foods and beverages; clear, front-of-package labelling; regulating the sale of breast milk substitutes; limiting the advertising and sale of 'junk food' near schools -- these and other measures could make a difference, it concluded.", "description": "A third of the world's nearly 700 million children under five years old are undernourished or overweight and face lifelong health problems as a consequence, according to a grim UN assessment of childhood nutrition released Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PQQ5z4zrGaAafMN.M6g1XA--~B/aD0xOTI0O3c9MzA5MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_US/News/US-AFPRelax/istock_844515234.268bc090026.original.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
