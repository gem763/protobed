Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) disagrees. According to Gabbard, impeachment proceedings would \"tear our country apart.\"\n\nThe revelation came about during an interview with Greta Van Susteren on her new show \"Full Court Press.\"\n\n\"Thank you for being here,\" Van Susteren said. \"But before I get to the issues that I want, we just heard about uniting communities across the country. Congress is coming back this week, and the House Judiciary Committee is planning on voting on an expanded impeachment inquiry. Do you support this?\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t,\" Gabbard said bluntly. \"You know, I think it\u2019s important for us to think about what is in the best interest of the country and the American people, and continuing to pursue impeachment is something that I think will only further to tear our country apart. Make no bones about it: We need to defeat Donald Trump. But I think it\u2019s important for our country\u2019s sake and our future that the voters in this country are the ones who do that, and I believe that we will.\"\n\nDemocrats have been divided over whether or not to impeach President Donald Trump. Progressive freshmen members of Congress, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) have been outspoken proponents of moving forward with impeachment proceedings. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), on the other hand, has made it very clear that she doesn't support impeaching Trump. She believes the move would give Trump an upper hand heading into the 2020 election.", "description": "Hmm..09/08/2019 19:25:41PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/60/9f1d352a-a24c-4438-b8c2-3ca0d5a52790.png", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
