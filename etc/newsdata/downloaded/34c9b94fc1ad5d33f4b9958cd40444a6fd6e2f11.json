Things are better in 4x4 models, where the Ram\u2019s 29 mpg rating matches the General Motors trucks and beats the Ford\u2019s 25 mpg.\n\nHowever, unlike its competitors, Ram offers the EcoDiesel engine as an option with every 1500 configuration, not just higher-end trims. It represents a $4,995 premium over the base V6 and costs $3,000 more than the popular Hemi V8, with the lowest priced Tradesman work truck model coming in at $38,585, compared to a $45,200 entry price for the Ford and $46,225 for the Chevy.\n\nMORE PICKUP NEWS FROM FOX NEWS AUTOS\n\nThe Ram also boasts the highest maximum towing capacity at 12,600 pounds, with the Ford second at 11,400 pounds and the Chevrolet maxing out a 9,300 pounds. And just for good measure, Ram is offering a 33-gallon fuel tank option that gives the truck a theoretical range of 1,056 miles between fill-ups.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Off by a mile, but that's not so bad.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
