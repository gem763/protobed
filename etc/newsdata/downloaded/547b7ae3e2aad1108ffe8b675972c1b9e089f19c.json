There\u2019s no choice, with Derrius Guice injured.\n\nBut coach Jay Gruden admitted it was tough to not give the veteran running back a uniform last week against the Eagles, deactivating a guy with 13,318 career rushing yards so he could fully fund his special teams units.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d Gruden said of the call, via J.P. Finlay of NBCSportsWashington.com. \u201cAdrian was on a couple of teams before we got him. It\u2019s hard sometimes to dress two backs on first down, two first down backs. You have to have guys who different things. You have to have a third-down back. Sometimes it\u2019s Chris Thompson, somebody else got to play third down. Somebody has to help on special teams. It\u2019s hard to get everybody up on a 46-man roster. We just chose to dress [Wendell] Smallwood for a special teams sake and only dress three running backs, which is something we\u2019ve done since I\u2019ve been here pretty much.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cSo it was a tough decision, something you never want to do, especially with Adrian Peterson. It\u2019s one game. We could dress them all next week and the week after that. So we\u2019ll just address it next week. But this week, with Darren Sproles back there on punts and on the road, we thought it was important to really have the coverage unit in place.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy for Gruden now, since Guice is expected to miss time with a knee injury suffered in the opener, and the coach is fine with that.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very comfortable,\u201d he said. \u201c[Guice and Peterson] are 1 and 1a to me. They\u2019re the same position. If something happens and Derrius can\u2019t go, we\u2019re happy to play AP and not even bat an eye. Hopefully Derrius will be fine, and eventually, there could be a situation we dress both of them and Chris Thompson. It\u2019s just a matter of where we are special teams wise that given week.\u201d\n\nOf course, kicking game concerns are important. But not being able to run effectively with a 17-point lead (which they blew) might also have been important, and having Peterson in uniform might have helped with that.", "description": "Washington will definitely be activating Adrian Peterson this week.
