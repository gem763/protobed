Orders fell 1.1 percent last month, the first monthly decline since May and April.\n\nCompared with a year ago, orders are down 5.6 percent, the worst drop off since the summer of 2016.\n\nTransportation orders can be volatile month-to-month so many economists strip this category out for a clearer look at sector. Excluding transportation, orders were down a smaller 0.3 percent.\n\nIt is likely that the ongoing grounding of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max and the strike by General Motors workers exacerbated the big decline in transportation orders. Commercial plane orders were down 12 percent. New autos and parts orders fell 1.6 percent.\n\nDefense orders can also be lumpy, exaggerating the ups and downs of the manufacturing sector. Excluding defense, orders were down 1.2 percent.\n\nOrders of metals were up 1.5 percent. Fabricated metal product orders, however, declined. Machinery orders rose 0.2 percent, a welcome respite from the declines in the previous two months.\n\nOrders for so-called \u201ccore goods,\u201d seen as a proxy for business investment because the category excludes both aircraft and defense orders, fell for the second month in a row. This highlights the widely reported decline in business investment, which is becoming a drag on the economy. There may be some evidence in the data from the very strong 6.4 percent growth in this category back in July.\n\nShipments for core capital goods fell 0.7 percent in September following a flat August and a 0.7 percent decline in July. These results will factor into third-quarter economic growth, reducing the gauge for nonresidential investment. It is likely that they will give new ammunition to those on the Federal Reserve seeking another cut at the next week\u2019s meeting.\n\n\u201cAfter this morning\u2019s advance durable manufacturing report from the U.S. Census Bureau, this morning\u2019s new home sales and construction costs from the U.S. Census Bureau, and the National Association of Realtors\u2019 existing-home sales release on Monday, the nowcast of real gross private domestic investment growth decreased from 0.3 percent to 0.0 percent,\u201d the Atlanta Fed said Thursday.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNOW model, which aims to measure economic growth based on the latest data, was unchanged at 1.8 percent despite the disappointing durable goods figures.\n\nOrders for computers fell 0.9 percent while orders for phones and other communications equipment jumped 1.4 percent. In the prior two months, communications orders had declined. This might be evidence of the \u201ciPhone effect,\u201d where consumers and businesses hold off on purchases in the summer months prior to the release of Apple\u2019s latest models.\n\nA slight silver lining to the otherwise dim report: August\u2019s overall new orders figure was revised up from 0.2 percent growth to 0.3 percent growth.", "description": "Very little good news in the report for durable goods orders in September, although phone and machinery orders rose. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1152411556-e1571936591361-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
