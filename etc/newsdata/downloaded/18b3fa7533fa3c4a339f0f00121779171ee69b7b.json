There was the O.J. thing too, but the American public was obsessed with The Simpsons\u2019 season-six finale, as they tried to figure out just who shot Mr. Burns.\n\nThe Simpsons had done events before. When Michael Jackson was set to appear in the season-three premiere, the ads began airing months in advance. The 100th episode dominated the Thursday night it aired with an hour-long Simpsons block. But \u201cWho Shot Mr. Burns?\u201d was unlike any episode before or since: It would be a two-parter, with a cliffhanger ending that would keep its fans in suspense all summer long, until the show returned with a resolution in its season-seven premiere.\n\nThe Pitch: A Murder Mystery\n\nFrom the outset, the story was designed as an event. Bill Oakley, one of the episodes\u2019 writers, tells Vulture, \u201cMatt [Groening] walked into our office at some point before the story conference and he literally said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we do some kind of stunt, like, who shot Mr. Burns?\u2019 and we were like, \u2018Hey! Great idea!\u2019\u201d Bill and his writing partner Josh Weinstein pitched the episode to the show\u2019s staff, and producer and TV legend James L. Brooks describes the moment on the show\u2019s season-six DVD as not just a pitch of a story, \u201cbut they also pitched how successful it would be, pitched how much it would help us for the following season.\u201d\n\nThe shape of the show went through a few changes in the process (originally Bill and Josh wanted the shooter to be Barney; Brooks suggested that it should be a family member, and showrunner David Mirkin gave the writers \u2014 spoiler alert \u2014 Maggie as the culprit), but both writers say that the other writers in the room found the concept \u201cirresistible\u201d and began pitching ideas for it. In no time, \u201cWho Shot Mr. Burns?\u201d quickly ballooned into something new for the show.\n\nThe Fan Contest Won by the Nonfan\n\nOakley and Weinstein wrote the two episodes back to back, and at some point in the process it became clear that this cliffhanger was going to be a huge deal. Before long, word of Fox creating some kind of contest in conjunction with the episode reached the staff, though the details were scant. Weinstein remembers that early on they heard it would have something to do with a 1-800 number and that it seemed very complicated. \u201cThis is still very early days for the internet,\u201d Weinstein tells Vulture. \u201c800 numbers were kind of like the internet back then: \u2018That\u2019s the future!\u2019\u201d\n\nPhoto: Fox\n\nWith a huge cliffhanger like this one, obviously Fox\u2019s marketing department wasn\u2019t going to miss an opportunity to monetize the hype. Enter: 1-800-COLLECT. The 800 number was launched by MCI in 1993 with a heavy marketing push that targeted Generation X in an attempt to break the monopoly on collect calling long held by AT&T. The Simpsons had already appeared in one commercial for the service, but this tie-in was much bigger in scope.\n\nFans who used the service between the season finale in late May and September 10, the week before part two premiered, would have the opportunity to guess who they thought shot Mr. Burns. At the initial meeting regarding the contest, Fox executives asked Groening and David Mirkin what they thought the prize would be, and Mirkin exclaimed, \u201cA million dollars!\u201d Fox did not take this suggestion.\n\nInstead, the winner of the contest would be animated into an upcoming episode of the show. \u201cI remember being in our office, hearing about it,\u201d says Weinstein, \u201cand being like, \u2018Huh. Okay. Maybe that will work.\u2019\u201d The contest itself was in place early enough in the process (Weinstein surmises somewhere between four and five months before \u201cPart One\u201d aired in May) that a reference to the contest, or a contest, could be hinted at by Dr. Hibbert in the closing moments of the episode.\n\nThrough a series of arcane rules, however, the outcome of the contest wasn\u2019t quite what everyone was hoping for. \u201cThe winner didn\u2019t even guess Maggie!\u201d says Oakley. Mirkin describes exactly what went wrong on the commentary track to \u201cPart Two\u201d: \u201cThey took all the entries and looked at 1,000 of them and \u2026 in those first 1,000 we didn\u2019t have anyone who \u2026 guessed Maggie \u2026 So I said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to do another sample of another 1,000,\u2019 and they said \u2018No.\u2019 The way the contest rules are, you must find a winner in the first 1,000.\u2019\u201d The winner of the contest (who picked Smithers) was \u201can older woman from Washington, D.C\u201d who didn\u2019t watch the show and thus wouldn\u2019t care about the prize, who was instead offered a cash prize of an undisclosed amount. (Though this woman never made it to Springfield, in the following season, which was run by Oakley and Weinstein, a new contest\u2019s winner appeared in the episode \u201cHomerpalooza\u201d who was so beyond irony that they no longer knew if their friend was being sarcastic.)\n\nKeeping It Confidential\n\nEven though the contest didn\u2019t work out as expected, once there was the idea of any kind of prize being connected to an episode of the show, security tightened up around The Simpsons\u2019 headquarters. According to Oakley, when it came time to have the table read for \u201cWho Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two),\u201d \u201cthe last ten pages of the script were not on the script. Josh and I had printed out just a couple of copies for the writers from our personal computers, and they were all shredded immediately afterward. They were only in the writers\u2019 room for a few minutes.\u201d\n\nWith the hundreds of animators it takes to create an episode of The Simpsons, even more precautions were taken. The aforementioned ten pages of script, in which Mr. Burns reveals to the citizens of Springfield that it was Maggie Simpson who shot him, were recorded by Harry Shearer, directed by Mirkin, and sent to the animators to finish. But then, Shearer and Mirkin improvised an alternate ending in which Burns reveals that it was his longtime assistant, Waylon Smithers, who was the perpetrator, and is then punished by his boss with a 5 percent pay reduction. This too was sent to the animators, ensuring that none of the artists could be certain who the culprit ultimately was. Going a step further, various scenes of other Springfielders actually shooting Burns were animated, including Barney; special guest star Tito Puente; Moe the bartender; Apu; and the Simpson\u2019s dog, Santa\u2019s Little Helper, to prevent the real ending leaking out. (This alternate ending, as well as these alternate assaults, eventually found their way into the following season\u2019s unorthodox clip show, \u201cThe 138th Episode Spectacular.\u201d)\n\nMirkin has claimed that he tried to leak the Smithers ending by calling various industry news outlets, including Entertainment Tonight, but he \u201ccouldn\u2019t find any dishonest people in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nAn Unwanted America\u2019s Most Wanted Special\n\n\u201cWho Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)\u201d aired at 8 p.m. on Sunday, September 17, 1995 and revealed the culprit to the American public, but if the usual half-hour wasn\u2019t enough Simpsons for viewers at the time, \u201cPart One\u201d aired at 7 p.m. and was followed by a half-hour special that aired only once, titled Springfield\u2019s Most Wanted.\n\nLike the Fox network\u2019s long-running America\u2019s Most Wanted it parodied, this special was hosted by John Walsh and gave viewers a rundown of the various suspects in Springfield, checked in with Vegas oddsmaker Jimmy Vaccaro for what the Simpsons betting markets were saying, spoke with former Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates, and offered celebrity predictions from Dennis Franz, Chris Elliott, Kevin Nealon, and others. Though Oakley worked in promotion for America\u2019s Most Wanted briefly in the early days of his career, he and Weinstein had no recollection of anyone on the staff of The Simpsons contributing to the special. \u201cIt was entirely done by Fox,\u201d says Oakley. \u201cWe were aware that it was being done, but that was the blessing and the curse of working on The Simpsons in those days: We didn\u2019t have any connection to the outside world.\u201d\n\nThe special, which ultimately saw the light of day once again on The Simpsons season-six DVDs, was not well-reviewed at the time, particularly Walsh\u2019s involvement in the comparatively frivolous production, seen by some contemporary reviewers as \u201ctacky\u201d and \u201cgimmicky.\u201d\n\nThe Legacy\n\nIn the 30-plus seasons of the show, \u201cWho Shot Mr. Burns?\u201d remains the only two-parter in Simpsons history, and the marketing blitz that bridged seasons six and seven may only be second behind that of The Simpsons Movie in 2007. Oakley and Weinstein assumed showrunning duties for The Simpsons\u2019 seventh and eighth seasons before moving on to their own projects, but that didn\u2019t mean they were done hanging out in Springfield, or even that they were done with the mystery of who shot Mr. Burns. Oakley describes an idea that he had pitched to a friend who still worked at The Simpsons in 2015: \u201cRemember that FX, People v. O.J. Simpson thing? I thought for the 20th anniversary of [\u201cWho Shot Mr. Burns\u201d], they should have made a live-action episode, with human actors playing Mr. Burns and Homer. It\u2019s one of my favorite ideas I\u2019ve had in years!\u201d", "description": "Talking with former \u2018Simpsons\u2019 writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein about \u201cWho Shot Mr. Burns?\u201d, the marketing stunt around it, and how the mystery two-parter changed what the show could be.", "authors": ["Ramsey Ess"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/18/18-simpsons-mystery-week-lede-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
