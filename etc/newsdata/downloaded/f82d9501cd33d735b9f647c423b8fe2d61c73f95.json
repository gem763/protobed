It is also considered a victory for the U.S president Trump in terms of the coming elections.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018It seems that its (the operation\u2019s) timing came after the end of the fountain of peace operation. It seems also according to some media outlets that regional countries or one regional country participated in the intelligence work for this operation.\n\n\u2018(This country) has not been named to avoid negative repercussions or revenge operations that the group (IS) might carry out. I think that Turkey has a role in the intelligence work.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
