Frankel and Burnett are no strangers. She\u2019s appeared in Burnett\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice: Martha Stewart\u201d in 2005 and as an investor on \u201cShark Tank.\u201d\n\nFrankel said she met with 10 networks and streaming providers and has sold two shows.\n\n\u201cMost of the shows are around women, business \u2014 some are around food. But mostly entrepreneurs and women. But not in a touchy feeling way but in sort of a hardcore way, if that makes any sense,\u201d Frankel said of the shows, noting that the new TV projects will be unscripted.\n\nGoing with your \u2018gut\u2019\n\nFrankel said she\u2019s always relied on her gut instincts when it comes to making business decisions. \u201cI wing it as I go,\u201d she said.\n\nShe used those basic instincts when she sold her low-fat liquor company, Skinnygirl Cocktails, to Beam Global in 2011 for a reported $100 million dollars \u2014 but kept the licensing rights to the name.\n\nThat shrewd business decision has served her well. Frankel\u2019s Skinnygirl empire has since expanded to include salty snacks (think Skinny Popcorn), non-alcoholic beverages, salad dressing, coffee, skincare, haircare, candles and most recently clothing. Her line of Skinnygirl jeans sold out the day it debuted on HSN. Frankel said she would be open to selling the business.\n\nFrankel said \u201cThe Real Housewives\u201d used to be a platform for Skinnygirl but it was also a \u201crisky\u201d one. When she left the show for three years, Frankel said a number of business opportunities opened up for her, including being a guest shark on \u201cShark Tank.\u201d \u201cI had to push my way through and get on \u2018Shark Tank\u2019 despite \u2018Housewives,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nShe shot down any idea of returning to \u201cHousewives\u201d again saying, \u201cThat audience I already know. I want to connect with a new audience.\u201d\n\nAs a woman in the male-dominated liquor industry, Frankel said she \u201chas always been about female empowerment. I don\u2019t see gender, race.\u201d As a guest shark on \u201cShark Tank,\u201d Frankel said a business must have amazing ideas and be able to execute in order to have her jump on board.\n\nBethenny Frankel arrives at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, Sept. 22, 2019, at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.

It\u2019s a far cry from her humble beginnings in Queens, New York, where Frankel describes her childhood as \u201cdifficult,\u201d growing up with a mother who was \u201calways drinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand money,\u201d she said, adding that there were just a lot of highs and lows growing up. \u201cI grew up in a gambling household.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d Follow her on Twitter @AlexisTVNews.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat zero commissions mean for stocks\n\nForget the stock market sell-off, Dow 30,000 is in sight\n\nSmarties \u2014 a 'recession-proof' candy \u2014 turns 70 years old with a brand-new look\n\n'Everybody\u2019s losing the trade war': Strategist\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.\n\nAll Markets Summit More\n\n\n\n", "description": "Entrepreneur Bethenny Frankel talks about how she built Skinnygirl and leaving The Real Housewives of New York City.", "authors": ["Alexis Christoforous"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EY6OrHmG1EfLX5y5GJn9Zg--~B/aD0yMzg0O3c9MzYwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/596b9890-eb77-11e9-bdfe-445e4b9a014f", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
