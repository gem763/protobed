The storm has maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph).\n\nThe hurricane center expects Humberto's outer bands to drop 1 to 2 inches (3 to 5 centimeters) of rain on the northwest Bahamas. It says swells from Humberto may cause \"life-threatening surf and rip current conditions\" in the northwest Bahamas and the U.S. coast from east-central Florida to North Carolina over the next few days.\n\n___\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nForecasters say Tropical Storm Humberto continues to strengthen, raising the risk of dangerous rip currents on the southeastern U.S. coast.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami reports Sunday evening that Humberto is about 170 miles (270 kilometers) east-northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, and has maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 kph). The storm is moving north at 6 mph (9 kph).\n\nHumberto is expected to become a hurricane Sunday night but remain away from land. No coastal watches or warnings are in effect, but the hurricane center said large swells from the storm could create dangerous surf conditions for the northwestern Bahamas and southeastern U.S. coast in the next few days.\n\n___\n\nThis item has corrected the day to Sunday, not Monday.\n\n___\n\n11:30 a.m.\n\nGusty winds from Tropical Storm Humberto are sweeping through portions of the northwestern Bahamas that were battered by Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said Humberto is 165 miles (270 kilometers) east-northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, and 180 miles (290 kilometers) north-northwest of Great Abaco island, which was decimated when Dorian barreled into the Bahamas earlier this month.\n\nAt 11 a.m. EDT, the storm was moving north at 7 mph (11 kph).\n\nNo coastal watches or warnings are in effect, although forecasters say Humberto will bring large swells to the northwestern Bahamas and southeastern U.S. coast for several days. The storm is expected to strengthen to a hurricane as it moves to the western Atlantic Ocean.", "description": "Forecasters say Humberto has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane.
