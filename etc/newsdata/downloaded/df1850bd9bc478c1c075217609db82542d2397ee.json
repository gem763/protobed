Mandatory Credit: Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports\n\nRosenhaus told ESPN on Saturday he\u2019s been in touch with a few teams, who \u201cwant information regarding (Brown\u2019s) legal situation and the NFL investigation\u201d into accusations against Brown of sexual assault and sending intimidating text messages.\n\nESPN reports that people around the league don\u2019t expect any team to sign Brown until the league\u2019s investigation is resolved.\n\nThe Patriots cut the controversial wideout on Friday afternoon, five days after Brown caught four passes for 56 yards and scored a touchdown in his debut with the team.\n\nThe NFL released a statement hours later in response to questions about Brown\u2019s status.\n\n\u201cOur office is presently investigating multiple allegations, some of which are the subject of pending litigation,\u201d the statement read, in part. \u201cWe have as yet made no findings regarding these issues. The investigation is ongoing and will be pursued vigorously and expeditiously.\n\n\u201cAs long as Mr. Brown is a free agent, placement on the Commissioner\u2019s exempt list is not appropriate. If he is signed by a club, such placement may become appropriate at any time depending on the status of the investigation. Upon the conclusion of the investigation, he may also be subject to discipline if the investigation finds that he has violated the law or league policies.\u201d\n\nBritney Taylor, Brown\u2019s former trainer, filed a civil suit last week accusing him of three incidents of sexual assault or rape over a two-year period from 2017-18. According to multiple reports, the league met with Taylor for 10 hours on Monday, and a meeting with Brown was expected at some point.\n\nOn Thursday, Sports Illustrated reported that a female artist \u2014 who leveled claims earlier this week that Brown made unwanted sexual advances before firing her \u2014 contacted the NFL claiming the 31-year-old wide receiver sent her \u201cintimidating and threatening\u201d texts. On Friday, the woman\u2019s attorney said the league had agreed to investigate the situation, and that the league had contacted the Patriots, who told Brown not to contact the woman any further.\n\nIn 10 NFL seasons (the first nine with Pittsburgh), Brown has 841 catches for 11,263 yards and 75 touchdowns. He is a seven-time Pro Bowl selection and four-time All-Pro.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "\"A few teams\" have reached out to express interest in free agent Antonio Brown since his release Friday by the New England patriots, according to the wide receiver's agent, Drew Rosenhaus.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432541385&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L04N-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
