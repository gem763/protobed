Sweden's Expressen newspaper reports the suspect arrested is also a senior lawyer, a woman who had previously been banned from contacting him. A witness told the paper the shooter was a man who wrestled with the victim before opening fire. Prosecutors told the paper the person arrested -- reportedly the woman -- is suspected of instigating attempted murder. It wasn't immediately clear whether the man who allegedly opened fire is also in custody.\n\nThe witness told the paper the lawyer was bleeding but conscious. He was shot in the head and chest, the paper reports.\n\nSwedish police said on their website the shooting is being investigated as an attempted murder. They say it's an \"isolated incident with no known connection to recent violent crimes.\" A$AP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was convicted of assault after the June brawl. He had pleaded self-defense and said he had tried to avoid a confrontation with two men who he said were persistently following his entourage. One of them picked a fight with a bodyguard, Mayers said during his trial.\n\nOn Aug. 14, Mayers and the bodyguards were given \"conditional sentences\" for the assault convictions, meaning they won't serve prison time unless they commit a similar offense in Sweden again.", "description": "Swedish press reports woman arrested instigated shooting; is fellow lawyer who had been banned from contacting him", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/06/d0ca1fb2-b839-468e-b619-ab4de77c1ee4/thumbnail/1200x630/6ad5c648c44f65627825d9f9305b07e5/sweden-lawyer-gettyimages-1153848687.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
