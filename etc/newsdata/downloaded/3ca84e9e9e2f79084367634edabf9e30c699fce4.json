USA TODAY\n\nWeek 5 brought Disney Night to \"Dancing With the Stars,\" filling the dance floor with beloved princesses, a dramatic pirate, a Pixar sheriff and a lion vying for dominance.\n\nTempers flared once again with the judges as the contest gets hot. But the true drama came with fairy tale dances that elicited tears of joy from the beautifully adorned Disney princesses as the judges threw out scores of nine like party favors.\n\nThe week might also have marked a breakthrough for the polarizing presence of Sean Spicer, who pulled off the closest thing to a ballroom dance yet in the competition. Here's what went down:\n\nTrump tweets support: Sean Spicer talks 'Dancing With the Stars' survival\n\nThis happened last week: Hannah Brown unleashed her rage, judge had a 'slugfest'\n\nSailor Brinkley-Cook as Cinderella with Val Chmerkovskiy.

She sees \"DWTS\" similarities with the princess after stepping in to fill in for injured Christie Brinkley. \"Just a month ago, I was flying out to watch my mom, now I\u2019m on \u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 \" she said in the video intro.\n\nWhen the spinning to \u201cA Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes\u201d began, the blue-dressed Brinkley-Cook was in full princess mode. The fog machines ran full-blast until the sweeping end with the clock on the wall striking 12. Christie Brinkley was in tears watching in the audience, Brinkley-Cook was choked up shortly after as the judges praised her.\n\nJudge Len Goodman called the dance, \"Light and fluffy, like a souffle. There\u2019s no way, with that performance, that you\u2019re not back next week.\"\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the belle of the ball; this girl was truly a Disney princess,\u201d said judge Bruno Tonioli, who matched the other judges' scores with an eight, putting Brinkley-Cook among the leaders.\n\nFinal score: 24/30\n\nKaramo and Jenna Johnson dance to \"I Just Can't Wait to be King\" from the Disney film \"The Lion King,\" on \"Dancing With the Stars.\" (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\n'Queer Eye' culture expert Karamo and pro Jenna Johnson\n\nKaramo stepped into the apex predator role from the \"Lion King\" a week after he was in the bottom two and nearly eliminated. He was spared by the judges who chose to have Lamar Odom eliminated instead. Karamo's samba to \"I Just Can't Wait to be King,\" against a backdrop of the African savanna, lacked some of the power his previous, less-appreciated dances have generated.\n\nGoodman, Karamo's most ardent critic, was magically forgiving. \"It was fun and joyful; unfortunately your feet are your problem,\" he said. \"However because it's Disney Night, I'm going to be kind.\"\n\n\"What you do is radiate joy; it's just so fun to watch you dance,\" said judge Carrie Ann Inaba, who had criticism of the couple's chemistry with a seven score (matched by all the judges).\n\nFinal score: 21/30\n\nKate Flannery flies in for her \"Mary Poppins\" number. (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\n'The Office' star Kate Flannery and pro Pasha Pashkov\n\nThe comedic actress took a hit from the judges last week with her attempts at serious heat during the tango. Dancing jazz as Mary Poppins to \"Spoonful of Sugar\" was just the medicine for Flannery, who dropped to the dance floor from wires with the famed umbrella. (\"I've never been so high in my life,\" she laughed later.)\n\nHer dance alongside six chimney sweeps played right into Flannery's comedic talents. She beamed and kicked in true vaudeville-pro style. The smiles continued as the judges' scores put Flannery back in contention.\n\n\"Kate is back!\" Inaba exclaimed, giving an eight score, matching all the judges.\n\nGoodman called it a \"sweet and delicious routine. You are back in the game.\"\n\nFinal score: 24/30\n\nSean Spicer is Woody from \"Toy Story,\" along with pro Lindsay Arnold, on \"Dancing with the Stars\" Disney Night. (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\nSean Spicer and pro Lindsay Arnold\n\nSpicer clearly had a friend in President Donald Trump, who tweeted his support before the show. The notoriously stiff former White House press secretary performed a quick-step dressed as Woody from \"Toy Story\" to \"You Have a Friend in Me\" (tearfully dedicated to his late father). Spicer's constant smile was back on full-grit for the dance and the show's portly engine-that-could pulled off some effective moves that resembled ballroom dancing.\n\nThe judges gave faint praise, but it was praise.\n\n\"It was better,\" said Tonioli, the judge known for his zealous over-statements. \"I could clearly see how much effort you put in. You have to give credit to someone who tries very hard.\"\n\n\"That was your best dance,\" said Inaba, who gave Spicer his first seven score. \"You really are dancing, Sean. It took my breath away.\"\n\nSpicer stayed at the bottom of the scoreboard, but showed improvement.\n\nFinal score: 19/24\n\nSinger Ally Brooke and pro Sasha Farber\n\nSinger Brooke went as beautiful Belle to Farber's Beast, dancing contemporary to \"Tale as Old as Time\" from her favorite Disney film, \"Beauty and the Beast.\" Brooke beamed as she sauntered around the dance floor, spinning twice while holding Farber's neck. The number was pure passion right through until rose petals fell from the ceiling. Brooke continued to be a judges' favorite.\n\n\"That was a minute and a half of absolute happiness,\" said a besotted Tonioli, who gave Brooke the season's first nine score, matched by all judges.\n\n\"That was smooth like butter on a hot muffin, gliding across the floor,\" said Goodman, calling it a \"cracking routine.\"\n\nBrooke was in tears seeing the highest scores of the season.\n\nFinal score: 27/30\n\nLauren Alaina and Gleb Savchenko danced to \"Under the Sea\" from \"Little Mermaid\" on Disney Night on \"Dancing with the Stars.\" (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\nCountry singer Lauren Alaina and pro Gleb Savchenko\n\nAlaina is stepping up in the competition and took heart, along with a red wig, to play Ariel in \"The Little Mermaid,\" They danced the samba to \"Under the Sea,\" a complicated number featuring Alaina frequently out of the hands of her partner. She kept the smiling going through some missteps and even with a slight wardrobe malfunction. \"I did this and this skirt stayed up here,\" she explained afterwards, giggling. She said it was by far her hardest dance.\n\n\"You make a great mermaid,\" said Inaba, who gave an eight. \"You're still moving forward, still growing.\"\n\nTonioli said Alaina \"went a bit weird, and you lost count. But it was a samba.\" He called it, \"fabulous underwater and pretty hot on dry land.\"\n\nFinal score: 23/30\n\nComedian/actor Kel Mitchell and pro Witney Carson\n\nMitchell was entirely in his element dancing jazz to the \"High School Musical\" song \"We're All in This Together.\" The one-time theater kid confidently took the solo lead through the complicated, infectious number. He even pulled off a brief break dance in the middle of the dance floor before the confetti fell.\n\n\"That was a dance that really suited you,\" said Goodman.\n\n\"You've graduated, you're top of the class. Tonight you were a revelation,\" said Tonioli, who gave a nine, matching Inaba's score. The strong total put the one-time bottom-dwelling dance team near the top.\n\nTotal 26/30\n\n'Bachelorette' Hannah Brown and pro Alan Bersten\n\nBrown was all Jasmine dancing the foxtrot to \"A Whole New World\" from \"Aladdin.\" She stepped off a carpet onstage and the magic began as she twirled in Bersten's arms as the fog machine churned. The dance ended with Bersten and Brown forehead to forehead with enchanted smiles.\n\n\"It really was a magic carpet ride you wanted to go on forever and forever,\" said Tonioli, admitting he couldn't see all the footwork due to the the massive amounts of fog.\n\nAlan Bersten and Hannah Brown take off in the Aladdin number. (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\nInaba said the dance \"took my breath away,\" giving a nine score. Goodman gave a low seven score, saying the dancer was so strong, she needed a harder dance.\n\nTotal score: 25/30\n\nActor James Van Der Beek and pro Emma Slater\n\nThe \"Dawson's Creek\" star went full pirate in his Jack Sparrow outfit and a fast-paced paso doble to the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" theme. Van Der Beek was all dramatic energy, leaping off stairs, slashing his arms about, sliding across the fog-filled floor on his knees with his eyes squinting. He ending throwing himself with abandon on the floor as if shot.\n\n\"That was insane \u2013 the drama, the dynamics. This was your dance,\" said Inaba, who gave a nine (matched by Tonioli).\n\n\"It was dramatic, it was strong, there was a touch of aggression,\" said Goodman, calling it a \"great routine, well-done.\"\n\nTotal: 25/30\n\nSo, what happened?\n\nThe Disney-dressed stars gathered on the dance floor to find their fate, based on judges' scores and viewer votes. But it was all a fat Disney lie. Everybody was saved.\n\n\"No one goes home on Disney Night,\" said host Tom Bergeron. All of the dancers will be back next week.\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/14/dancing-with-the-stars-recap-week-disney-night/3977496002/", "description": "Week 5 brought Disney Night to \"Dancing With the Stars,\" filling the dance floor with princesses, a pirate, a sheriff and a lion\u00a0vying for dominance.", "authors": ["Bryan Alexander", "Published P.M.
