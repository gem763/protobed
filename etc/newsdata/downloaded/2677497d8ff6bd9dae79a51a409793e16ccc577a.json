The 'Museum of the Man', to put it briefly,\" he added.\n\nThe producers said the film, which will be co-written by \"Moloch\" screenwriter Marion Festraets, has been \"in development since the beginning of the year\" and talks were going on with distributors.\n\nFrench police are still trying to track down the missing jewelry, and believe part of the loot was sold in Belgium.\n\nLast year Kardashian's insurance company launched a $6.1 million lawsuit in the U.S. against her former bodyguard Pascal Duvier and the company he worked for, ProtectSecurity, for breach of contract.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "The dramatic Paris gems heist in which Kim Kardashian was tied up and robbed of jewelry worth some nine million euros is to be made into a movie. \"Fashion Week\" will be adapted from a 130-page graphic novel that cult French writer and director Joann Sfar has written but which\u2026", "authors": ["Vince Black", "Norman Goodman"], "top_image": "https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/c1/d8/f6d418ce8fa541fa64cc2c34fe590c8589a7/c1d8f6d418ce8fa541fa64cc2c34fe590c8589a7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
