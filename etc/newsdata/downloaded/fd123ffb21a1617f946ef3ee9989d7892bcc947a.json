The benefits will include vision, prescription and dental coverage.\n\n\"GM is very concerned about the significant confusion caused around our employee's health care coverage,\" a GM spokesman said.\n\n\"Throughout this negotiation, GM has said that our number one focus was on the wellbeing of our employees.
