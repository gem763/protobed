Susan Collins faces fresh fire after emergence of new Kavanaugh allegation", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) speaks to journalists while walking to the Senate floor for votes on Jan. 24. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) is facing fresh attacks from Democrats after a newly surfaced allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh put his contentious confirmation back in the public spotlight.\n\nMaine state House Speaker Sara Gideon, her most prominent opponent for reelection next year, posted a photo of Collins and Kavanaugh to Twitter on Sunday with a link to her fundraising page.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of hoping that Susan Collins does the right thing when she has shown time and time again that she puts Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell ahead of Mainers. If you\u2019re with me, please make a contribution to our campaign today,\u201d she wrote.\n\nCollins\u2019s support for Kavanaugh, announced in a 44-minute speech less than a day before the Senate voted to confirm the judge, was a key moment in the high-court saga over allegations of sexual misconduct made by several women who said they had had encounters with him decades ago.\n\nThe fate of Collins, more than any other senator up for reelection next year, is tied to her handling of Kavanaugh, with Democrats arguing that her strong support provided a key boost for his confirmation and undermined her carefully tended moderate profile.\n\n[Senator told FBI last fall of new information about Kavanaugh]\n\nIn the speech, Collins called the opposition to Kavanaugh \u201ca caricature of a gutter-level political campaign\u201d and said liberal groups were trying to \u201cwhip their followers into a frenzy by spreading misrepresentations and outright falsehoods\u201d about him.\n\nCollins\u2019s stance on Kavanaugh\u2019s behalf, coming just as she entered a reelection cycle, immediately galvanized both her supporters and detractors. She posted the best fundraising quarter of her 23-year Senate career after Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation \u2014 a fact that Gideon noted in her introductory campaign video.\n\n\u201cSusan Collins\u2019s vote to put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court may be paying off for her, but it\u2019s putting women\u2019s control over their own health-care decisions in extreme jeopardy,\u201d Gideon said in the video, which also included footage of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) calling Collins\u2019s handling of Kavanaugh \u201coutstanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe news stories today are not adding anything to what has already been reported,\u201d said Annie Clark, a spokeswoman for Collins.\n\nA Gideon campaign aide said that the Democrat has highlighted Collins\u2019s backing of Kavanaugh \u201cconsistently since the day we launched.\u201d\n\nThe new allegation was first aired in a New York Times Sunday Review article published online Saturday, rooted in the reporting by two Times reporters for a forthcoming book about Kavanaugh. The piece was later updated to note that the alleged victim did not speak to the reporters and told friends that she did not recall the incident.\n\nAlthough reporters found only secondhand corroboration for the incident, alleged to have taken place at Yale University while Kavanaugh was an undergraduate, it raised questions about the thoroughness of the FBI and Senate investigations that preceded Kavanaugh\u2019s Oct. 6 confirmation.\n\n[Democratic candidates demand Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment after new allegation in Times piece]\n\nCollins at the time called the investigation \u201cvery thorough\u201d and reviewed copies of FBI interviews before delivering her speech. Now her opponents are accusing her of relying on a slipshod review of the allegations in determining her vote.\n\nPam Cunningham, a sexual assault survivor affiliated with the Democratic-leaning group Mainers for Accountable Leadership, recalled meeting with Collins before the Kavanaugh vote and receiving assurances from her that the FBI would get to the bottom of the separate allegations from high school acquaintance Christine Blasey Ford and college classmate Deborah Ramirez.\n\n\u201cI asked her, \u2018What if the investigation is inconclusive?\u2019 \u201d Cunningham said in a statement released by Mainers for Accountable Leadership. \u201cShe shook her head and confidently told us, \u2018Oh no, it will be a very thorough investigation.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are attacking the Times for reporting an unsubstantiated allegation and Democrats for seizing on it with calls for further investigation and, in some cases, impeachment.\n\n\u201cThis shameful attack \u2014 aided by a few members of the media \u2014 is nothing more than a blatant attempt to undermine the Supreme Court and the will of the people who voted for a conservative judiciary,\u201d said Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who is facing a difficult reelection bid, called the reemergence of the Kavanaugh controversy \u201can absolute disgrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrett Kavanaugh is an outstanding Supreme Court Justice, and the left\u2019s most recent effort to destroy his life and impeach him will fail,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "The Maine Republican\u2019s top Democratic opponent used a photo of Collins and Kavanaugh to raise money.", "authors": ["Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "September At Pm", "Mike Debonis Covers Congress", "With A Focus On The House", "For The Washington Post.
