Reuters was first to report the news.\n\nRight to be forgotten is a European policy that lets individuals ask Google to remove sensitive information, including their past crimes\n\n\"Right to be forgotten\" is the idea that private citizens can ask companies or websites to take down certain material about them that is considered to be \" inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive.\"\n\nThe idea rose to prominent in 2014 when the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that individuals have the right to ask search engines, such as Google, to delist certain results about them. Since then, Google has become a target of requests from people wanting to remove content.\n\nIn this particular case, France's data-protection agency CNIL has argued that while Google does delete, or \"delist,\" some results from private citizens when requested, it isn't delisting the results globally, and it should be.\n\nRead more: Google is fighting a big, messy battle over whether expanding the 'right to be forgotten' amounts to censorship\n\nWhile supporters of privacy rights say that \"right to be forgotten\" is an important tool to protect people online, Google said that expanding this globally would impinge on freedom of speech.\n\nRichard Cumbley, a partner at law firm Linklaters, pointed out to Reuters that it could be especially complex in the US as if this were passed, it could \"create a serious clash\" with concepts of freedom of speech there, he said.\n\nA man once asked Google to scrub results relating to his benefits fraud, but provided forged proof of his innocence\n\nGoogle has indicated that since 2014 it has received more than 3.3 million requests in Europe to delete links from search results. 45% of these URLs have been delisted, it said.\n\nGoogle also lists out example requests, apparently to show how \"right to be forgotten\" can be used for legitimate and dishonest purposes.\n\nFor example, in one request from the UK, a man who was convicted of benefits fraud in 2012 asked Google to delist nearly 300 articles related to his conviction based on a document he provided suggesting he was later found innocent of the crime.\n\nGoogle then describes the outcome of this. \"We delisted 293 URLs pursuant to the documentation the requester provided. The requester then asked us to delist several other pages related to his separate conviction for forging documents. After re-reviewing the original document he submitted as proof of his innocence in the benefits case, we discovered that it was a forgery. We reinstated all of the URLs we had previously delisted.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Google did not immediately reply to Business Insider's request for comment.", "description": "On Tuesday, the European Court of Justice will decide on two cases that could impact how Europe's so-called \"right to be forgotten\" policy is applied.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/578049c588e4a7da328b6bae-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
