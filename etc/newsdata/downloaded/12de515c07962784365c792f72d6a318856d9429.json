The latter company was spun out of Liberty Global LBTYA, +0.46% last year and operates in more than 20 countries across Latin America and the Caribbean. The company has a fiber optic cable network beneath the sea and on land that connects more than 40 markets in the region.\n\nThe deal includes network assets, including spectrum, as well as real estate and leases and 1.1 million wireless subscribers and contracts, AT&T said in a statement.\n\nAbout 1,300 current AT&T employees will move to Liberty Latin America once the deal closes, with AT&T providing support during the transition.

The company acquired Cabletica of Costa Rica in October of 2018 for about $250 million.\n\n\u201cWe believe LILA is paying an attractive price for the asset, reflecting Puerto Rico\u2019s difficult macro environment as well as AT&T being a willing seller given its debt reduction priority,\u201d wrote Harrigan. It should also have appeal for U.S. investors by increase Liberty Latin America\u2019s dollar revenues.\n\nSee now: AT&T\u2019s video business is decaying and a new streaming service may not save it\n\nBenchmark rates Liberty Latin America a buy with a stock price target of $26 that is about 53% above its current trading level.\n\nLiberty Latin America stock has gained about 18% in 2019.
