On that fateful day, it was hovering over Budgam airfield. The Air Force personnel manning the SPYDER missile system was tasked to keep the airbase safe from any attack by the PAF.

The pilot of the IAF plane parachuted down in Pakistan occupied Kashmir(POK) and was taken POW. He was repatriated a few days later.\n\nBalakot strike\n\nPrior to this, the IAF had carried out a successful attack on the Balakot training camp in POK and as per the latest information over 200 terrorists were killed.\n\nThe Pakistan Air Force had launched a reprisal raid but it did not bring any results and the PAF planes offloaded their bombs on mountains and fields. The Balakot strike was launched after a suicide bomber had targeted a para-military soldiers' convey and 42 paramilitary soldiers were killed. This was on the highway from Jammu to Srinagar. The soldiers belonged to the CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force).

He also assured that remedial measures have been taken to obviate any similar incident taking place like the downing of the MI-17. The Court of Inquiry has been completed and two officers found guilty would be punished.\n\nDuring his interaction with the press, the chief did not specify whether they will face administrative action or a disciplinary action like a court martial.", "description": "An Indian Air Force Mi-17 helicopter was shot down by mistake by a SPYDER missile AD system over Srinagar airfield killing six air force personnel.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Susan B.", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Read More On The Same Topic Mg Singh", "Nearly Half Of Tigers Rescued A Thai Temple Die", "Soul Sisters", "Russia'S Most Popular Cheerleading Group Unfazed Dancing In Cold Summer", "Israel Bars Two Democratic Party Senators Entering Country"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/5/os/b_1200x630/iaf-boss-accepts-shooting-down-own-chopper-was-big-mistake-image-screenshot-ndtvyoutube_2334379.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
