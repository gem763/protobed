For two athletes, Saturday\u2019s UFC on ESPN+ 20 event marked that special moment in their career.\n\nCheck out this week\u2019s rookie report to see what kind of first impression those fighters made on the sport\u2019s biggest stage from Singapore Indoor Stadium in Singapore.\n\n* * * * *\n\nLoma Lookboonmee\n\nDivision: Strawweight\n\nResult: Loma Lookboonmee def. Alexandra Albu via split decision (30-27, 28-29, 30-27)\n\nRecord: (4-1 MMA, 1-0 UFC)\n\nGrade: A-\n\nLoma Lookboonmee was emotional following her split-decision win over Alexandru Albu (a result which had absolutely no business as anything but a unanimous nod, by the way), and rightfully so as the first Thai fighter signed to the promotion.\n\nLookboonmee\u2019s pedigree as a muay Thai stylist was clear from the start, punishing her opponent with lashing kicks and showing dangerous elbows and knees in the clinch. While she\u2019s relatively early in her MMA career, Lookboonmee boasts some 16 years of experience in combat sports, and comfort level in competition is clear.\n\nAlbu is a fighter who has traditionally been able to overpower her opponents, and while she appeared to be the stronger fighter, Lookboonmee had the technique in the clinch to stay upright despite multiple attempts. What we didn\u2019t see from Albu were traditional wrestling takedowns, and I\u2019ll be anxious to see how Lookboonmee deals with those moving forward.\n\nOn the feet, Lookboonmee is comfortable retreating and firing, and understandably so with her slick technique on the feet. There\u2019s no question that her standup game will match well with anyone in the division, but if a striker is comfortable at a high volume and with constant forward pace, they may find some openings, as Albu did score with power on occasion.\n\nStill, Lookboonmee is a welcome addition to the UFC and appears to have plenty of upside. Hopefully she will also help bring other seasoned Thai fighters \u2013 in both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s divisions \u2013 to the octagon.", "description": "Fighters from around the globe dream of the day they'll step into the octagon the first time \u2013 so how did the newcomers perform on Saturday?", "authors": ["John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Blue Corner", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/loma-lookboonmee-ufc-singapore.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
