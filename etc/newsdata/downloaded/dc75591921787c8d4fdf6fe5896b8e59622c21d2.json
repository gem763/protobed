The footage, captured by Dakota Randall, showed a couple riding along the Massachusetts Turnpike \u2014 with no one seemingly alert.\n\nThe driver looked hunched over and the passenger also appeared to be dozing off. Randall posted the video to Twitter on Sunday. \"Some guy literally asleep at the wheel on the Mass Pike (great place for it). Teslas are sick, I guess?\" he tweeted.\n\nRandall told CBS Boston he tried waking them up by honking but it didn't work. \"It was just so strange and baffling,\" Randall told the station. \"I thought I saw somebody asleep at the wheel but I wasn't sure so I did a double-take. Sure enough, there was somebody with his head right between his legs.\"\n\nSome guy literally asleep at the wheel on the Mass Pike (great place for it).

It does not allow the driver to abdicate responsibility.\n\nThis is the latest incident involving a driver seemingly asleep at the wheel of one of Tesla's self-driving cars. In August, another video circulated of a driver who appeared to be dozing off on the I-5 near Santa Clarita, local station KABC-TV reported.\n\n@RalphNader Ralph can you do anything about stopping this disturbing phenomenon? My wife and I shot this video last week on the busy I-5 in LA. @Tesla #sleepingdrivers #unsafeatanyspeed pic.twitter.com/ADbpt0uSZ4 \u2014 Clint Olivier (@ClintOlivier) August 21, 2019\n\nLast week, a National Transportation Safety Board report found the driver of a Tesla was using the car's Autopilot system when a vehicle in front of him suddenly changed lanes and he didn't have time to react before crashing into a fire truck near Los Angeles.", "description": "The footage shows two people riding along the Massachusetts Turnpike \u2014 with no one awake", "authors": ["Christopher Brito"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/09/7c8de6a8-d9ca-4fb2-bbe8-684becb62f4e/thumbnail/1200x630/1ac7751ddf41e6e6b8a5c9d2b4bffc04/screen-shot-2019-09-09-at-3-14-07-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
