China's yuan, CNH= which hit a six-week high in offshore trade on Monday, before retreating, was steady at 7.0617 per dollar.\n\nBeyond the trade headlines, the major focus this week is the Fed meeting.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is expected to cut rates for a third time in a row when it concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nInvestors are watching for any indication that further cuts are likely, with futures pricing suggesting an expectation for further easing in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe forward guidance will be the thing,\u201d said Westpac analyst Imre Speizer in Auckland.\n\n\u201cIt still looks like a done deal that they will cut, but then the risk is that they might characterise that as just one more insurance move ... the market will have to take out the pricing it\u2019s got for future dates.\u201d\n\nThe British pound, meanwhile, GBP= nudged lower to $1.2857, with Brexit hanging in the balance.\n\nThe European Union has agreed to delay Britain\u2019s exit for up to three months, but the country is politically paralyzed and overnight parliament rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s third attempt to schedule a Dec. 12 election.\n\nJohnson has said he would try again, by a different legislative route that would only require a simple majority, rather than a two-thirds majority.", "description": "Both the dollar and riskier Asian currencies held on to modest overnight gains on Tuesday, amid hopes for an easing in Sino-U.S. trade tensions and as investors waited for direction from this week's Federal Reserve meeting.", "authors": ["Tom Westbrook", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446015526&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S01G", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
