The lawsuit seeks at least $50 million in damages.\n\nThe allegations of sexual assault first showed up in a separate lawsuit Rad is currently pursuing against Match Group and its parent company IAC. In that case, Rad claims that Match Group and IAC purposely undervalued Tinder in an effort to avoid paying millions in stock to the team\u2019s co-founders.\n\nBlatt\u2019s lawsuit also claims that Pambakian will get paid \u201cmillions\u201d if Rad wins the case\n\nPambakian was initially part of Rad\u2019s case, but she had to drop out because of an arbitration agreement she signed with Match. She\u2019s now separately suing Blatt and Match Group over wrongful termination and sexual assault. Pambakian claims that Blatt assaulted her in a hotel room after a 2016 Tinder holiday party; her employment was terminated in December 2018.\n\nBlatt\u2019s lawsuit says Pambakian is being used by Rad to build his lawsuit against Match and that Rad \u2014 and Bench Walk Advisors, the outside firm funding Rad\u2019s lawsuit \u2014 allegedly offered Pambakian millions of dollars to participate in the lawsuit, regardless of its outcome. Although she had to drop out of the lawsuit, Blatt claims Pambakian still received an upfront payment for her initial participation and to come forward with her allegations of assault.\n\nThis is disputed by Orin Snyder, the lawyer for Rad and Pambakian. \u201cThere were no upfront payments promised for joining the lawsuit,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cThe only payments were triggered by IAC/Match retaliating against plaintiffs by stripping away their hard-earned equity.\u201d\n\nBlatt\u2019s lawsuit also claims that Pambakian will get paid \u201cmillions\u201d if Rad wins the case.\n\nIn his lawsuit, Blatt claims that Pambakian flirted with him routinely and that the holiday party interaction was consensual. The lawsuit says Pambakian and Blatt\u2019s \u201cfully-clothed bodies were in contact\u201d and that the two kissed. Pambakian says in her lawsuit that Blatt groped her breasts and upper thighs and kissed her shoulders, neck, and chest. The two lawsuits mention that Blatt and Pambakian agreed to not speak of the incident again, but Pambakian says that she remained quiet because she feared damaging her working relationship and reputation, while Blatt\u2019s lawsuit suggests that she did so because the situation was consensual.\n\nBlatt cites a text message Pambakian sent the other employees who were in the hotel room as evidence of the casual nature of the interaction.\n\n\u201cThis is a new low for IAC/Match and their former CEO,\u201d said Snyder. \u201cThey continue to retaliate against and smear a victim of sexual assault and the person who reported it. Their attacks are based on lies and documents that are taken out of context. When all of the evidence comes to light, it will be obvious what happened here. It\u2019s shameful that these public companies are continuing to cover-up the truth.\u201d (IAC and Match are not involved in Blatt\u2019s defamation suit against Rad and Pambakian.)\n\n\u201cThis is a new low for IAC/Match and their former CEO.\u201d\n\nTo bolster Blatt\u2019s claims, his lawsuit cites emails in which Pambakian says she didn\u2019t know who told Rad about the interaction and that she wanted to move on from the situation. Other emails and texts from Pambakian to Blatt suggest a flirty relationship; Pambakian, for instance, told Blatt that he\u2019s \u201cstill gorgeous\u201d even with an eye infection that they discussed over email.\n\nIn a draft of Blatt\u2019s resignation letter from Tinder obtained by The Verge, he admits to the hotel room situation and says that what he calls \u201csnuggling and nuzzling\u201d were consensual. There were four people in the hotel room, including Blatt, and the resignation letter says he apologized to both women present. \u201cThe executive with whom I had been flirting returned the apology, saying \u2018It was as much me as you,\u2019\u201d he wrote. After a later complaint from someone who hadn\u2019t been present at the hotel room, Match Group launched an investigation. Blatt\u2019s eventual departure had nothing to do with the decision to leave Tinder or Match Group, he wrote in the letter.\n\nIn a separate April 2018 exchange, nearly two years after the hotel room incident, Pambakian invites Blatt to an event where Cher, Katie Couric, Monica Lewinsky, and other celebrities would be attending. Blatt didn\u2019t make it to the event, and his lawsuit claims that was their last interaction before Pambakian and Rad went public with their lawsuit in August 2018.\n\nUpdate October 3rd, 6:48PT: Adds Orin Snyder\u2019s statement disputing the filing\u2019s claims about upfront payments to Pambakian.", "description": "Former Tinder CEO Greg Blatt is suing Tinder co-founder Sean Rad and the company\u2019s former VP of marketing and communications Rosette Pambakian for defamation after Pambakian went public with sexual assault allegations against Blatt.
