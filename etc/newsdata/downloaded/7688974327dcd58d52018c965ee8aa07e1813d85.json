Now he pilots delivery robots for a San Francisco Bay Area startup that wants to disrupt burrito delivery.\n\nPostmates, which in mid-August received a permit to operate its Serve delivery robot in San Francisco and is already testing it for food delivery in Los Angeles, employs a growing team of \u201cpilots\u201d to remotely oversee, and at times steer, these four-wheeled food ferries.\n\n\u201cWe will probably see a drastic increase in our workforce over the next five years,\u201d says Postmates Chief Executive Bastian Lehmann.\n\nMichael Niedermayer, a former drone pilot now working for Postmates, said his job remotely steering delivery robots \u2018felt like a great fit for my military background.\u2019 Photo: Talia Herman for The Wall Street Journal\n\nDisrupting \u201clast-mile\u201d delivery\u2014historically the domain of box trucks, bike couriers and personal vehicles\u2014\u201cfelt like a great fit for my military background,\u201d says Mr. Niedermayer.\n\nHis story is hardly unique. Across industries, engineers are building atop work done a generation ago by designers of military drones. Whether it\u2019s terrestrial delivery robots, flying delivery drones, office-patrolling security robots, inventory-checking robots in grocery stores or remotely piloted cars and trucks, the machines that were supposed to revolutionize everything by operating autonomously turn out to require, at the very least, humans minding them from afar.\n\nUntil the techno-utopian dream of full automation comes into effect\u2014and frankly, there\u2019s no guarantee that will ever happen\u2014there will be plenty of jobs for humans, just not ones their parents would recognize. Whether the humans in charge are in the same city or thousands of miles away, the proliferation of not-yet-autonomous technologies is driving a tiny but rapidly growing workforce.\n\nReal-Life RoboCop\n\nMimi Kongnarinh started on the night shift at Cobalt Robotics, patrolling the offices mostly of other tech and some manufacturing companies. Her work would be familiar to any night watchperson from the last century\u2014chatting up familiar employees, introducing herself to fresh faces and keeping a wary eye out for anything out of the ordinary.\n\nShare Your Thoughts If you could do your job by remotely operating a robot from afar, would you? Join the conversation below.\n\nWhat made her job unusual is that she would patrol multiple offices simultaneously, and that for most of her eight- to 12-hour shift, she never left her desk in San Mateo, Calif. By remotely monitoring her largely autonomous robot charges, she was able to add a human touch when necessary\u2014such as politely asking unfamiliar employees to badge in on the robot\u2019s scanner\u2014while also keeping down her employer\u2019s labor costs.\n\nA Cobalt robot patrols an office in San Jose, Calif. Photo: Cobalt Robotics\n\n\u201cWe get a live feed of every event that happens at every site we patrol,\u201d says Ms. Kongnarinh, who now works day shifts. \u201cWe can see if it\u2019s a person, motion, anything like that, and we can jump in when we have to.\u201d\n\nNearly all companies using \u201cautonomous\u201d robots have to depend on what the head of Postmates\u2019 technology skunkworks, Ali Kashani, calls the 1-to-N ratio\u2014N being the number of robots a single human can handle.\n\nFor a company like San Francisco-based Simbe Robotics\u2014which makes five-foot-highrobots that wheel around grocery stores, taking inventory\u2014the N can be fairly high because their robots are almost entirely autonomous. When the robots are introduced in a store, says Lauren Milliken, a field deployment engineer at the company, they must be steered by a human to build a map. Humans also have to take over on rare occasions when, for instance, there\u2019s construction in a store or someone harasses a robot, she adds.\n\nFor Flytrex, a drone delivery company currently operating in Iceland and participating in a Federal Aviation Administration trial in North Carolina, the ratio is one to one. Eventually a single person will be able to ride herd on a dozen drones, says CEO Yariv Bash, but for the next decade at least, a human must pay attention the entire time each drone is in the air.\n\n\u201cYou can prepare for 99.9% of situations, but there\u2019s a really long tail of really weird situations, and you need a human for that,\u201d he says. Be it air-traffic emergencies, weather anomalies or volcanic eruptions, the human must always have the ability to override the autonomous system and guide the drone back to earth.\n\nWhile humans might be more capable than artificial intelligence at this stage, these remote-controlled robots can, if handled incorrectly, kill people.\n\nWhen Lives Are at Stake\n\n\u201cRemote control of cars is the dumbest and the most insane idea I have ever heard,\u201d says Mary Cummings, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and the director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab at Duke University. \u201cI\u2019ll be the first person they should call as an expert witness when a death inevitably occurs,\u201d she adds.\n\nCompanies working with remote-controlled robots know there are risks, and try to mitigate themin a few ways. Some choose only to operate slow-moving machines in simple environments\u2014as in Postmates\u2019s sidewalk delivery\u2014so that even the worst disaster isn\u2019t all that bad.\n\nMr. Niedermayer positions a Postmates delivery robot on a sidewalk.

Prof. Cummings says this technique is safer than actual remote operation, since safety isn\u2019t dependent on a perfect wireless connection or a perfectly alert human operator.\n\nFor every company currently working on self-driving cars, almost every state mandates they must either have a safety driver present in the vehicle or be able to control it from afar. Guidelines from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration suggest the same.\n\nMost companies in the space have opted for something short of true teleoperation, which is dependent on an absolutely reliable and fast wireless connection as well as the skill of the human remote operator. Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Waymo\u2019s remote operation system and another being tested by Nissan rely on humans to either confirm the vehicle\u2019s choices when it\u2019s unsure what to do or help it navigate around obstacles.\n\nRemote-operation software developer Phantom Auto Inc., based in Mountain View, Calif., designs human supervisory-control systems for self-driving vehicles, but the software lets humans assume full remote control if needed. Since autonomous vehicles are still quite limited in their capabilities, factors like inclement weather, construction sites or previously unmapped areas could require operators to step in.\n\nSuch scenarios worry Prof. Cummings. \u201cIf there\u2019s any teleoperation [of a car] going on in a hundred-mile radius, I want to know about it because I want to get off the road,\u201d she says.\n\nShai Magzimof, Phantom Auto\u2019s co-founder and CEO, says that even when a remote driver is \u201cdirectly\u201d piloting a vehicle, it still has safety components engaged, such as object detection and avoidance. To date, there have been no accidents involving the company\u2019s systems, he adds.\n\nPhantom Auto is betting the shift to remote operation might become an important means of employment for people who used to drive for a living. Josh Resnick, a former Israeli army drone operator, trains Phantom Auto\u2019s remote operators and those of its customers. Training new drivers typically requires one to three weeks, he says, and the only qualification is that someone have a driver\u2019s license and a clean driving record.\n\nEven the best driverless cars struggle to recognize uneven terrain or navigate difficult weather.

In the future, many more of its customers are likely to involve trucks, passenger cars and shuttles on the open road. Those applications are in testing, says Elliot Katz, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief business officer.\n\nOur Remote-Controlled Future\n\nThere might eventually be other requirements, however. One might be a tolerance for working for a lower wage, since remote operation could allow companies to outsource driving, construction and service jobs to call centers in cheaper labor markets.\n\nAnother might be a youth spent gaming. When Postmates managers interview potential delivery-robot pilots like Diana Villalobos, they ask whether or not they played videogames in their youth.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid, my parents always said, \u2018Stop playing videogames!\u2019 But it came in handy,\u201d she says.\n\n\u2014For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.\n\nWrite to Christopher Mims at christopher.mims@wsj.com", "description": "Until the techno-utopian dream of full automation is realized, the growth of not-yet-autonomous technologies is creating opportunities for humans to help operate robots remotely, sometimes from thousands of miles away.", "authors": ["Christopher Mims", "Christopher.Mims Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EW202_KEYWOR_SOC_20190830144316.jpg"}
