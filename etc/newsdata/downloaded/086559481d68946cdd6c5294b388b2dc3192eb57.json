This much we know for sure. We know a bunch more, too, (as outlined in this rumor roundup from yesterday), thanks to both official reveals and unofficial leaks. How much of this was planned is hard to say, but Google seemingly doesn\u2019t mind building up the hype cycle.\n\nEarlier today, Best Buy Canada made what may well be the most egregious reveal today (granted, there are three more days left to leak). The big box store posted up a preorder page for the upcoming smartphone. As expected, the listing was taken down, but not before 9to5Google managed to snap some screen shots.\n\nFrom the looks of things, the rumors are pretty spot on. The device will come in both standard and XL versions, at 5.7 and 6.3 inches, respectively. Both models sport a Snapdradon 855, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, along with a new Face Unlock feature. There are dual camera on each, per the listing \u2014 12 and 16 megapixels \u2014 in the iPhone 11-esque square configuration.\n\nThere\u2019s a single front-facing 8 megapixel camera on each, and a 2,800 and 3,700mAh battery on the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. Other highlights including the expected addition of \u201cQuick Gestures,\u201d which use use a wave of the hand to interact with the device \u2014 similar to features we\u2019ve seen on other handsets before.\n\nConspicuously missing from the preorder, however, is the expected \u201cOh So Orange\u201d color. Could be a preorder thing or maybe Best Buy Canadian customers will have to settle for Just Black and Clearly White. Maybe the company is saving some surprises for Tuesday\u2019s event.
