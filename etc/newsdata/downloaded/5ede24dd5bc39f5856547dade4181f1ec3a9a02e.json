He\u2019s always going to be difficult but we\u2019ve got our plans so we\u2019ll try to keep going to them and hope to get him out.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s battle with Jofra Archer, who bounced him at Lord\u2019s, was one of the most eagerly-anticipated aspects of the game.\n\nHowever, in difficult bowling conditions, Smith dealt with the England paceman comfortably.\n\nOverton said: \u201cWe all tended to struggle with the wind. I wouldn\u2019t look too much into it. He\u2019ll be raring to go tomorrow, firing in and bowling as quick as he can. Hopefully taking a few wickets as well.\u201d\n\nEngland came into the match on a high after their remarkable Ben Stokes-inspired win at Leeds but Australia are hoping to quell their momentum by batting on.\n\nLabuschagne, who has scored four successive half-centuries, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about (England\u2019s momentum) not being an issue for us at all.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just focused on the process of winning a Test match. It\u2019s about taking it a ball at a time, day at a time \u2013 and trying to make sure we\u2019re doing things right.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what we have been doing the whole series. We haven\u2019t been getting too far ahead when we\u2019ve done well, and haven\u2019t been getting too far down when we\u2019ve done poorly.\u201d", "description": "Craig Overton is confident England\u00a0can seize control of the fourth Ashes Test on Thursday.
