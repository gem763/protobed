However, when it came to Lubna\u2019s team, things didn\u2019t go as planned and they failed the task.\n\nEach team needed to create a prototype e-bike, then plan and host their own launch event where they attempted to sell their products to some of the UK\u2019s biggest cycle retailers.\n\nDespite being pleased to have left the show, the mum-of-two exclusively told Metro.co.uk that they didn\u2019t show her response to Lord Sugar when she was fired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I contributed to every single element in the task and in the boardroom when Lord Sugar asked me \u201cwhat did you do?\u201d my actual answer wasn\u2019t the answer that was shown on TV,\u2019 she explained.\n\n\u2018I gave him a list of things that I did and they didn\u2019t show it.\n\nThe Apprentice candidates in the boardroom (Picture: BBC)\n\n\u2018Scarlett and Tommy were actually having an argument in the boardroom and I broke the argument up. Tommy did lose his temper several times during the process and I did calm him down a lot, and that wasn\u2019t shown either.\u2019\n\nLubna went on to explain the reasons why she believes the producers choose not to air certain parts of the show.\n\nShe continued: \u2018I understand that not everything can be shown but I did that think that in a way things are edited to justify Lord Sugar\u2019s decision in terms of who he is firing, rather than showing the balanced view.\n\n\u2018When I gave him a list of things I did during the task, they showed me answering a different question, that\u2019s why it looks weird on the show.\u2019\n\nLubna said she has removed herself from the Whatsapp Group (Picture: Fremantle)\n\nLubna said she believes Lord Sugar made the right decision, although she wasn\u2019t the reason they failed the task.\n\nShe added: \u2018I am happy I got fired, I missed my kids and I wasn\u2019t going to be an attention seeker or throw anyone under the bus to stay and I certainly wasn\u2019t going to grovel to Lord Sugar, I know my worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think that he needed to decide who he wants to be in business with and if he felt I wasn\u2019t the right person then he made the right decision for him. I was not the failure of the task, I wasn\u2019t the person who designed the bike and I wasn\u2019t the one selling them.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t even ride a bike so I wasn\u2019t going to try and blag selling one. I think because I am a nice person and I\u2019m quiet they used that as a weakness against me to throw me under the bus and Lord Sugar did fire me.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s nothing wrong with looking after yourself but if you\u2019re knocking someone else down while you\u2019re doing it, it\u2019s not nice or professional.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nTalking about her fellow candidates, Lubna admitted that people with the \u2018loudest voices\u2019 got more air time.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think the loudness of someone\u2019s voice reflects their contribution,\u2019 she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018A lot of times people don\u2019t do a lot, but they talk too much and then they get into arguments and that\u2019s when they get the air time.\n\n\u2018I did actually contribute in every single area and I gave the bike name and my bike name was chosen but because of various reasons we couldn\u2019t use it in the end.\n\n\u2018Everyone throws everyone under the bus, I left my job to go on the show, I left my kids and husband but everyone is out for themselves.\n\n\u2018No one is there to make friends, you just make friends by accident, because you\u2019re living with them.\u2019\n\nThe Apprentice continues Wednesday at 9pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
