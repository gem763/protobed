Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people. I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations. What kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d\n\nThe flurry of developments triggered a wave of speculation about the future of the talks, as well as sharp criticism from some Republicans, who expressed outrage that Mr. Trump had secretly planned to allow Taliban leaders to visit the United States and Camp David in the first place.\n\nThe meeting would have occurred just days before the 18th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \u2014 strikes carried out by al Qaeda, whose leaders were being given safe-haven by the Taliban, which ruled Kabul at the time.\n\n\u201cCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney, Wyoming Republican said in a tweet. \u201cNo member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, a U.S. Air Force veteran of the Afghanistan war, was also outraged. \u201cNever should leaders of a terrorist organization that hasn\u2019t renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country. NEVER. Full stop,\u201d the Illinois Republican said.\n\nMr. Pompeo defended Mr. Trump on Sunday, saying the presidential retreat in Maryland was an \u201cappropriate place,\u201d given it has been the venue for Mideast peace negotiations and other diplomatic meetings in the past.\n\nAppearing on five Sunday TV talk shows, Mr. Pompeo said Mr. Trump wanted to look the Taliban leaders \u201cin the eye\u201d while Mr. Khalilzad worked to finalize an agreement that would allow the U.S. to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan.\n\nThe talks toward such a withdrawal have for months represented a sticky backdrop to the president\u2019s campaign promise to bring a close to America\u2019s \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East. Despite horrific Taliban attacks over the months, the administration had \u2014 prior to this weekend \u2014 been forging ahead with the talks, even as disagreement over their direction spilled into the open among some of Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisors.\n\nEarly drafts of a tentative peace deal reportedly would\u2019ve seen roughly 5,400 of the 14,000 U.S. troops currently in Afghanistan come home, along with the shuttering of five American military bases in the country. In exchange, the Taliban, which currently controls significant territory outside Kabul, would guarantee that Afghanistan will never again be used as a base from which terrorist groups can attack the West.\n\nBut there was little indication the group would accept a formal ceasefire. And, while Mr. Khalilzad held his most recent meeting with Taliban leaders in Qatar on Friday, there were signs of mounting opposition to a much-anticipated deal inside the White House, the State Department and at the Pentagon.\n\nMr. Pompeo, for instance, reportedly refused to sign a tentative draft agreement after Taliban representatives had demanded that Afghanistan be recognized by Washington as the \u201cIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan\u201d \u2014 the name by which the country was known in the years leading up to the 9/11 attacks.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Pompeo said the Taliban had \u201coverreached\u201d with its most recent car bomb attack and that it will now be up to the militant group to decide whether talks can resume. \u201cThey tried to use terror to improve their negotiating position,\u201d the secretary of state said, adding that Taliban representatives had also \u201cfailed to live up to a series of commitments that they had made.\u201d\n\nThe most recent attack was not the first since talks with the Taliban began and, Mr. Pompeo said Sunday that U.S. forces have also been attacking the militants. He said more than 1,000 Taliban fighters have been killed in battle during the past 10 days alone, although it was unclear whether he meant they were killed by American airstrikes or by Afghan security forces, who\u2019ve been on the front lines since the U.S. military ended its combat mission in Afghanistan 2014.\n\nOver the past five years, the American troops remaining in the country have been training, advising and assisting the Afghan forces.\n\nThe Afghan government said Sunday that it did not believe Taliban talks would continue \u201cat this stage.\u201d\n\nTaliban representatives also cast a negative light, asserting that Americans will be the ones who suffer. \u201cBoth sides were preparing for the announcement and signing of the agreement,\u201d the militant group said in a statement, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe statement said Taliban representatives had been invited to the United States in late August, but wanted to wait until the deal was ready to be signed. Now, it said, \u201cwe will continue the ongoing jihad (against foreign occupation) and we firmly believe in the ultimate victory.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
