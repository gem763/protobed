We've got four games away now on the trot, so hopefully those statistics will turn.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSolskjaer has done his homework on tonight's opponents Partizan - while he is already familiar with their winger Zoan Tosic, who he coached in United's reserves between 2009 and 2010.\n\n\"Of course, I've watched many (Partizan) games in the lead-up here,\" said Solskjaer.\n\n\"I also watched them when they played Molde, which is my old team. Of course it was a game that I was following very close.\n\n\"I know them, I spoke to the coach in Molde, what did he feel.\n\n(Image: ANDREJ CUKIC/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\"Zoran I had in the reserves at Man United many times. A fantastic boy, great left foot, great work ethic.\n\n\"It'll be nice to meet Zoran tomorrow, but hopefully we stop his left foot because that is of the best quality.\n\n\"We've seen the team and prepared our team against them. A team with some pace, big strong striker and some talent in there. Two or three very exciting players.\"", "description": "United must start winning on the road as Europa League clash against Parizan Belgrade kicks off four away trips in a row", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Reuters", "Pa", "Andrej Cukic Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708970.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Europa-League-Manchesdter-United-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
