Dozens of Hampstead residents, including the TV presenter Bill Oddie, 78, were celebrating victory as the Keats House museum scrapped its \u201cinappropriate\u201d plans to sell alcohol and screen films.\n\nThe Grade-I listed Georgian house in north-west London, Keats\u2019 home for two years until shortly before his death in 1821 at the age of 25, inspired some of his most memorable poems and is a popular museum today \u2013 attracting nearly 14,000 visitors over the last year.\n\nKeats House bosses were pilloried by local residents for setting out plans to sell alcohol until 10pm every day except Sunday and hold screenings and readings.\n\nHampstead inspired various other romantic poets in Keats\u2019 era, among them Byron, Wordsworth and Joanna Baillie.\n\nIt\u2019s questionable whether Keats, responsible for a poem containing the line \u201cGive me women, wine, and snuff\u201d, would approve of his neighbours\u2019 objections.\n\nCampaigners referred to Keats\u2018 more critical takes on inebriation, such as: \u201cShall I gulp wine? No, that is vulgarism, a heresy and schism, foisted into the canon-law of love.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to Camden council\u2019s licensing panel, Oddie said: \u201cIt seems that sooner or later every attractive venue applies for a liquor and music licence, no matter how inappropriate it is.\n\n\u201cAs a resident of this area for over 30 years, I ask you to reconsider this proposal and support the notion of Keats House as a stylish historic memorial to the poet himself. Mind you, if he were in charge he and his mates would have probably have turned it into an opium den.\u201d\n\nThe City of London Corporation, which owns Keats House, amended its proposals, limiting events to 50 per year and capping indoor capacity to 100 people. Plans to sell beer were also scrapped. Alcohol will be sold at a maximum of six outdoor events per year, with a maximum capacity of 200.\n\nInstead of boozing at the museum, fans can do a ramble across Hampstead Heath and flock to the 16th century Spaniards Inn instead, said to be the pub where Keats penned his famous Ode to a Nightingale.", "description": "Hampstead museum where poet once lived drops plans following objections from locals", "authors": ["Jedidajah Otte"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45d42b143abff52e01d9db9f39caa87b6e58cf7/0_579_2238_1343/master/2238.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8b15f7235e4c651ee322f83b55fcc6f5", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
