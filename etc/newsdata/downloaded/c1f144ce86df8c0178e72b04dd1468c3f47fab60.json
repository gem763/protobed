He has a good experience here also in England, in the Premier League, with adapting with Watford and I respect him a lot.\n\n\"I think now he\u2019s going to know the team, the players and he knows some players because he trained them three years ago and I think he is also going to be good also.\n\n\"I really respect every coach. I think now with Quique Sanchez Flores, they are going to continue working well like they were doing with Javi Gracia. We are going to respect them and prepare for the match thinking of us in the beginning and after, respecting them with their characteristics. After, some things can change. Watford are going to be the same in their great spirit like a team and also they are going to push a lot in Watford with their supporters. They have very good players.\"", "description": "Arsenal\u00a0travel to Watford\u00a0aiming to build on the momentum gained from their north London derby comeback.\u00a0 The Gunners rebounded from 2-0 down to salvage a point against Tottenham.\u00a0 While the Hornets, too, will be hopeful of picking up a result today after sacking Javi Gracia and replacing him with Quique Sanchez Flores.", "authors": ["Michael Jones"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/15/14/gettyimages-1169925753.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
