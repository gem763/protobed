Both Mr Trump and Russia have denied any involvement.\n\nWhat were the diplomat's concerns?\n\nWe know from the call transcript that Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden \"as a favour\".\n\nBut text messages show US officials discussed what the Ukrainian president should say in a statement afterwards.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Zelensky was reportedly \"sensitive\" about being seen as a US \"instrument\"\n\nBy 13 August, Kurt Volker advised that Mr Zelensky's statement should address interference in US politics, \"especially with the alleged involvement of some Ukrainian politicians\" - and Burisma, the company Joe Biden's son was involved in.\n\nThere has been no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.\n\nThen, on 29 August, the tone of discussions changes. Mr Zelenksy's aide Andriy Yermak sent a curt message to Mr Volker, including a link to a Politico story headlined Trump holds up Ukraine military aid meant to confront Russia.\n\nMr Taylor, the senior diplomat in Ukraine, seemed to voice his concerns about the motives for the delay in a text on 1 September and a week later.\n\n\"I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" he said.\n\nThat suggestion, however, was firmly pushed back by Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who said Mr Taylor was misunderstanding the president's intentions:\n\nWhat are Democrats and Republicans saying?\n\nIn a letter alongside the release of the texts, top-ranking Democrats criticised Mr Trump's \"now open defiance of our core values as American citizens.\"\n\n\"The President and his aides are engaging in a campaign of misinformation and misdirection in an attempt to normalise the act of soliciting foreign powers to interfere in our elections,\" it said.\n\n\"This is not normal or acceptable. It is unethical, unpatriotic, and wrong.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump calls for China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens\n\nBut Republican Jim Jordan said the Mr Volker's testimony on Thursday had \"undercut the salacious narrative that Representative Adam Schiff is using to sell his impeachment ambitions\".\n\nMr Jordan is the ranking Republican in the House Oversight Committee which tweeted that \"this information [contained in the text messages] cannot possibly be understood without Volker's explanations from yesterday's testimony\".\n\nHe has called for the entire transcript of the testimony to be released.\n\nDonald Trump and his defenders have insisted there was no quid-pro-quo in his dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Text messages between members of the US team involved in Ukrainian diplomacy, however, suggest a different story.\n\nIt was very clear to them what the Mr Trump wanted: a publicly announced Ukrainian investigation of political rival Joe Biden and the 2016 election hacking.\n\nIt also was very clear what they had to offer the Ukrainians: not only US military aid, which had been put on hold by the White House, but also a meeting between the two presidents in Washington that would have be extremely valuable in bolstering the legitimacy of the newly elected Ukrainian leader.\n\nDrawing a straight line between the offer and the ask doesn't take much imagination.\n\nIt may not be long before the White House falls back to its final line of defence - that threatening and cajoling Ukraine to investigate Mr Biden was justified by the egregiousness of Mr Biden's alleged corruption.\n\nWith Mr Trump backed into a corner, it's a recipe for all-out political warfare.", "description": "\"It's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" one diplomat warns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pjlfn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
