Positive earnings results from a number of major companies also helped buoy sentiment.\n\nHere were the main moves in the market, as of 10:30 a.m. ET:\n\nS&P 500 (^GSPC): +0.49%, or 14.58 points\n\nDow (^DJI): +0.35%, or 94.28 points\n\nNasdaq (^IXIC): +0.46%, or 37.46 points\n\nCrude oil (CL=F): -0.43% to $53.13 per barrel\n\nGold (GC=F): +0.04% to $1,494.60 per ounce\n\nTop UK and EU officials said Thursday that they reached a new Brexit deal, completing the agreement just before EU leaders were set to review it in Brussels.\n\nIn a Twitter post Thursday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the sides \u201cgot a great deal that takes back control,\u201d and indicated that Parliament could get Brexit done as soon as Saturday. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, for his part, called the deal a \u201cfair and balanced agreement.\u201d The EU is widely expected to approve the deal during its two-day summit in Brussels, which began Thursday.\n\nUK equities and the British pound surged against the dollar (GBPUSD=X) and euro (GBPEUR=X) following the announcements. However, these pared some gains after other lawmakers came out and cast doubt on the prospects of Parliament passing the deal. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) issued a statement saying, \u201cAs things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues, and there is a lack of clarity on VAT.\u201d\n\nThe backing of the 10 DUP members of Parliament will be instrumental for the deal\u2019s passage, given that Johnson does not have a majority in Parliament, and many Conservative MPs have suggested they will not vote for the agreement in absence of unionist support.\n\nOther geopolitical negotiations have continued to trudge along.\n\nChinese officials are working on drafting the text of a \u201cphase one\u201d trade agreement with their U.S. counterparts, a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman said during a briefing, according to Bloomberg. Ministry spokesperson Gao Feng said China will increase purchases of American agricultural products \u201caccording to domestic needs,\u201d according to Bloomberg\u2019s report and translation, but declined to confirm whether China would hit the $40 to $50 billion in annual purchases that President Donald Trump has previously touted.\n\nEarnings update\n\nThe first major week of third-quarter corporate earnings results has so far largely reflected positively on reporting companies, helping to assuage fears of a year-over-year decline in aggregate earnings per share (EPS) for S&P 500 members. Heading into third-quarter results, Wall Street consensus was looking for aggregate EPS to drop around 3% over last year, for the first decline since 2016.\n\nNEW YORK, NY \u2013 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

Operating margins improved 670 bps year-over-year to 18.7%, topping the company\u2019s prior guidance. Netflix also reiterated its negative free cash flow guidance for the fiscal year of -$3.5 billion, and said it is tracking to stem some of its outflow in 2020.\n\nThe Street largely shrugged off the light guidance for fourth-quarter earnings and new subscribers, which Netflix said reflected uncertainty around variables including new title launches, subscriber churn and competition from new entrants to the over-the-top streaming arena.\n\nMeanwhile, big bank earnings results continued with Morgan Stanley (MS) before the bell on Thursday. The company beat expectations on nearly every major metric, circumventing the softness analysts had expected to see in big bank earnings this reported quarter as lower rates cut into big bank profitability.\n\nEquities sales and trading revenue was about flat over last year at $1.99 billion, while fixed income trading rose 21% to $1.43 billion. Net interest income rose 30% to $1.22 billion, topping expectations for just $969.8 million on this measure, according to Bloomberg estimates. Overall, firm net revenues of $10.03 billion represented the highest third quarter in the past 10 years.", "description": "U.S. stocks tracked gains in European equities as optimism bubbled up over a Brexit deal.
