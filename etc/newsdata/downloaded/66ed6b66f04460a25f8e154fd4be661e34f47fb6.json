Others active in the sector include Legal & General (LGEN.L) and Pension Insurance Corporation.\n\nThe Allied Domecq deal comes just a day after Rothesay agreed Britain\u2019s biggest-ever pension transfer deal with telecoms firm Telent over its defined benefit, or final salary, scheme.\n\nAs well as initially insuring Telent\u2019s scheme, as with Allied Domecq, the Telent deal will eventually see Rothesay take on full responsbility for the scheme members, known as a \u2018buy-out\u2019.\n\nThe successful completion of two large deals comes as Rothesay mulls an appeal against a court ruling stopping the transfer of 12 billion pounds in annuities from Prudential (PRU.L), with a decision expected imminently.\n\n\u201cThis transaction is further evidence that large maturing pension schemes are increasingly looking to secure de-risking opportunities,\u201d said Sammy Cooper-Smith, who works on business development at Rothesay.\n\n\u201cRothesay Life\u2019s balance sheet strength, expertise and considerable ongoing shareholder support means that we are a very good insurance partner to the largest pension schemes in the UK.\u201d\n\nGiven a healthy pipeline of potential new business, Rothesay Life\u2019s shareholders have contributed a further 200 million pounds of new equity into the company, Rothesay said, taking total new equity raised in 2019 to 700 million pounds.", "description": "British-based Rothesay Life broke new ground for the burgeoning pension risk transfer industry on Friday, striking an insurance deal that protects the retirement savings of the largest-ever number of yet-to-retire members.", "authors": ["Simon Jessop", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
