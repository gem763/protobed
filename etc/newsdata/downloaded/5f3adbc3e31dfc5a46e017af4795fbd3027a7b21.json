The victory allowed him to overtake three drivers in the overall points standings and bring home the series championship.\n\nAs the UTV Turbo race settled in, Guthrie Jr. sat at 10th place, but he charged the course in dramatic fashion, running a pace nobody could keep up with and ultimately stealing first. Polaris RZR Factory Driver Branden Sims finished in second place in only his second race behind the wheel of his RZR. Polaris RZRs claimed six of the top 10 spots with Polaris Supported Athlete Randy Romo coming home fifth and Factory Racers Justin Lambert and Ryan Piplic finishing sixth and eight respectively. Fellow Polaris Supported Athlete Sierra Romo celebrated her belated 19th birthday with a ninth-place finish.\n\nRZR Factory Driver Seth Quintero fell short on a UTV Pro Production perfect season but still brought home the Best In The Desert series championship. After pulling the hole shot and keeping the lead for six laps, Quintero got stuck behind a lapper on the second-to-last lap costing him the lead. Quintero battled back in a fast whoops section regaining the lead until an arm pin bolt backed out, causing a long repair and relegating Quintero to an 11th place finish.\n\nPolaris Sponsored Athlete Adrian Orellana battled for first place after a stop for quick repairs and still crossed the finish line minutes ahead of second place. Polaris Supported Athlete Madeline Wedeking took second and 62-year-old Joe Bolton finished third for a Polaris podium sweep. Polaris Supported Athletes Corbin and Kaden Wells brought their Risq Racing Polaris RZRs home fourth and sixth respectively, helping to fill eight of the top 10 spots with Polaris RZRs.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, the Polaris RZR Factory Racing Team completely dominated the field over the course of this year\u2019s Best in the Desert Series, and Mitch Guthrie Jr. and Seth Quintero capturing the coveted series championships makes it all that much sweeter,\u201d said Kyle Duea, vice president of ORV Marketing for Polaris Off Road. \u201cWith plenty more racing to go this season, there\u2019s still more success to be had as our drivers and crews look ahead to the next challenge.\u201d\n\nPolaris RZR Factory Racing will look to continue its winning ways October 26 at the LOORS Off Road Championship in Chandler, Ariz.\n\nMore information about Polaris Off-Road Vehicles and Polaris Engineered Accessories can be found at RZR.Polaris.com.
