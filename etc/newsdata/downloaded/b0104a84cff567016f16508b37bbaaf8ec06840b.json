Britain is building the world\u2019s biggest windfarm in the North Sea. It will be in what we call Doggerland, the once-great landmass that was home to our ancestors, animals, pastures and forests, when Britain was linked to Europe by land.\n\nTruth: Hard economics are a much more powerful force in getting the world to change than protesters marching in the streets\n\nThere are already many wind turbines in the North Sea and elsewhere around our coast, and the UK produces 40 per cent of Europe\u2019s wind power.\n\nBut what was new in Friday\u2019s development was not just the scale of what is planned, but the price at which the companies bid to supply wind power to the grid. It was \u00a339.65 per megawatt-hour.\n\nThat is stunningly cheap. It is more than 30 per cent lower than the price at a similar auction two years ago, and roughly the same as power from fossil fuels. Think two years forward and it looks as though wind power will have become cheaper than any other form of electricity.\n\nThe firms involved, including SSE Plc, Equinor ASA and Innology SE, are not doing this out of charity. They are bidding for these contracts because they think they can make money at these prices. This is a tipping point. For many years wind and solar power required subsidies.\n\nThe companies involved either depended on those subsidies, or ran pilot schemes that might make them look good but did not really shift the balance of their business. Now that alternative energy sources make economic sense, expect all the energy utilities and the oil giants to move to transform their operations.\n\nThis will not, of course, happen overnight. There will still have to be standby power. Nor will it happen everywhere. The UK is unusual in having a lot of wind and a lot of coastline, and for other countries solar power will be a more cost-effective option.\n\nElectricity storage remains a challenge, though costs there are falling too. And you have to remember both that fossil fuels supply 85 per cent of the world\u2019s primary energy and that total energy demand will rise as living standards go up in the emerging world. But now big money is driving the shift, things will move even faster.\n\nTHOMAS COOK\u2019S insight was to see that people who wanted to travel needed help. So in 1841, he ran his first Cook\u2019s tour, taking a group of temperance campaigners to a teetotal rally in Loughborough.\n\nFrom the 1870s onwards his son transformed the fledgling business into a great global brand.\n\nThat brand was strong enough to survive nationalisation in 1948, multiple ownership in the 1970s, control by the Midland Bank, and a string of other owners through to the 2000s, until eventually it was merged with MyTravel in 2007.\n\nAnd now, with the company apparently on the brink of administration? Well, the outcome is unclear but two things are obvious. One is that the brand is trashed. I can\u2019t see it recovering.\n\nThe other is that budget airlines and the communications revolution have combined to transform the holiday market. Why commit yourself to a package holiday when you can book cheap flights and a good hotel deal in a couple of hours on the internet? Thomas Cook had a big idea. But we no longer need it.\n\nIT IS great that Dame Helena Morrissey should be a contender for the next Governor of the Bank of England. I know her only slightly but can assure you she is decent and humane, as well as being hugely successful in her chosen field of fund management.\n\nShe founded the 30% Club, which has promoted the rise of women on the boards of companies. She has little experience in monetary policy, but that must be a big plus.\n\nWe need new thinking in central banking, and someone who has had the duty to look after savers\u2019 money is the person to bring it.", "description": "Hard economics are a much more powerful force in getting the world to change than protesters marching in the streets.", "authors": ["Hamish Mcrae", "Financial Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
