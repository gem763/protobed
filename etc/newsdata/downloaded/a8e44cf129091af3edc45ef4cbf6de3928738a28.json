But all of those spaces really are ripe for transformation.\"\n\nEven the bank's workspace could use a bit of network hurry-up, according to Vudrag.\n\n\"When you look at our staff, we have some really great modern workspaces, where people are free to move and sit where they like, but we haven't quite got a network that supports that,\" he said.\n\n\"So there's a lot of opportunities there for wireless, increased levels of bandwidth and lower latency to ramp up the capabilities that we can offer to our staff. The payments network, the ATM network, and then most importantly, I think for us, where we see immediate benefits for something like 5G is in our branch network.\"\n\nAt the start of the year, Telstra and Commbank said the pair would trial 5G during 2019.\n\nEricsson ANZ head Emilio Romeo told ZDNet at the time that some of the 5G use cases that the trial will look at included exploring different network architectures such as network slicing, dynamic orchestration, and control use plane separation.\n\nAt Vantage, Telstra spoke of 5G allowing CBA to create a staff-less pop-up branch, with Telstra network engineering executive Channa Seneviratne saying he thought the sweet spot for 5G was in enterprise.\n\nVudrag added the bank saw opportunities for helping its mobile bankers with technology, for instance, by cutting down on hours of travel to simply get documents signed, as well as looking at the internet of things.\n\n\"Look, you wouldn't normally associate a bank with internet of things, but we are actually doing some work in that space,\" he said.\n\n\"Within our agribusiness area, in our asset management, asset sharing space, we're actually right now piloting putting some sensors on crop dusters, to the able to track usage. And you know, it's a pretty interesting and exciting opportunity for us.\"\n\nDisclosure: Chris Duckett travelled to Telstra Vantage as a guest of Telstra\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nMicrosoft and Telstra team up for business data sharing platform\n\nAzure used for upcoming Data Hub product targeted at water management, agribusiness, and connected supply chain.\n\nPenn labels 5G as a strong growth engine for Telstra\n\nWith each generation of mobile technology, average revenue per user increases, and 5G should be no different, Telstra CEO Andy Penn said.\n\nTelstra Mining Services to deploy underground LTE network in Queensland\n\nAn initial 6.5 kilometre private network will be created for South32's Cannington mine.\n\nTelstra places its IT services businesses under Purple banner\n\nBrands such as VMTech, MSC, Readify, Kloud, Bridgepoint, O2, NSC, iVision, and Company85 will now be Purple.\n\nTelstra sees profit plunge 40% for full year\n\nRevenue was down 3.6%, while profit has slid by AU$1.4 billion for the year to June 30.", "description": "Sydney, don't ask.
