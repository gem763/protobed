They apologized to Apstein, they said their internal investigation had been wrong, they promised that they will \u201ccontinue to make this cause a priority for our organization.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 24: President of Baseball Operations and General Manager Jeff Luhnow of the Houston Astros talks to the media during the press conference during the World Series Workout Day at Nationals Park on Thursday, October 24, 2019 in Washington, District of Columbia.

I\u2019m not interested in relitigating Taubman\u2019s actions and whether he \u201cdeserved\u201d to lose his job. But in order to believe that his termination concludes the relevance of this incident you would have to believe that there are no broader implications for how the Astros handled the accusations and how they continue to frame the conversation.\n\n(Yahoo illustration/Amber Matsumoto)\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is not about hanging onto hurt even after repercussions doled out, it\u2019s about considering what a situation like this playing out in the spotlight can tell us about the times when all of baseball isn\u2019t around to hold the Astros accountable.\n\nIt is helpful to think of firing Taubman not as a punishment for a crime \u2014 the Astros are not a law-enforcement agency and he didn\u2019t break the law. Often people default to that sort of punitive language and end up lamenting that a man lost his job over a single outburst. Hopefully that\u2019s not what happened. What it should have been was a good-faith effort by a company to seriously consider whether someone they employed was projecting bias or contributing to a hostile work environment. Unfortunately, Luhnow\u2019s statements feel more like a capitulation to the public outcry than a careful consideration of the merits of those complaints.\n\n\u201cThis is not something that's endemic. This is not a cultural issue,\u201d he said in no uncertain terms. He described the comments as \u201cout of character\u201d for Taubman, using that phrase twice.\n\nHe also said of the initial statement, the one that lashed out at SI\u2019s reporting, \u201cI saw it before it went out. And there's a lot of people that saw it before it went out.\u201d\n\nIt is not hyperbolic to suggest that if the Astros front office were actually committed to \u201cusing our voice to create awareness and support on the issue of domestic violence\u201d that they would have welcomed reports and corroboration that someone in their employ did not reflect those values. They would want to know if and why journalists might not feel comfortable in their clubhouse. This is not actually too much to ask \u2014 for well-meaning, or purportedly well-meaning and certainly well-paid, people to treat the broader societal culture that too often tolerates or downplays domestic violence as the adversary instead of the people who take issue with it.\n\nMuch of what Luhnow said on Thursday attempts to perpetuate the convenient delusion that what happened at the ALCS was a standalone incident and not a sobering tip of the iceberg. And yet, why should the public believe that when the team has repeatedly demonstrated this week precisely why someone who is made to feel uncomfortable in their clubhouse wouldn\u2019t usually come forward on her own? They successfully telegraphed to anyone made uncomfortable in that clubhouse in the future that you\u2019ll need a small army of witnesses, the attention of the entire country, and an MLB investigation to be believed, or to receive an apology if you\u2019re accused of journalistic malpractice when you\u2019re not.\n\nThe nature of the allegations never changed and neither, frankly, did the evidence (only interviewing internal witnesses prior to their first statement was a decision borne not out of availability but intent to obscure). What happened between Monday and Thursday was that the Astros realized the league was not wholly on their side, and that it would be a bigger distraction to play whack-a-mole with corroborating evidence than it would be to fire Taubman.\n\n\u201cI think when a story comes out that's negative you have two choices: You either respond immediately if you think it's potentially not true; or you wait and figure out what the facts are and then respond,\u201d Luhnow said. \u201cAnd we made the wrong decision, we responded quickly thinking that it was not true.\u201d In addition to straining the merits of what you can even call a mistake (treating knee-jerk defensiveness predicated on self-aggrandizing assumptions and actually knowing the truth as equally valid options that an intelligent person might reasonably be confused by), their admitted proclivity in these situations betrays their priority \u2014 and that is to cover up.\n\nHere is a blanket statement: If you are so shocked to learn that there is misogyny in the hypermasculine space of a baseball clubhouse (or really any modern workplace) that you automatically disbelieve it, then you are simply not savvy or socially aware enough to have a CEO-level position. If you lied about that because it\u2019s convenient or because you think naivety to these issues would be somehow seen as sympathetic, that\u2019s disqualifying as well. To anyone reading this: Trust me that sexism has been baked into the fabric of society for centuries, it\u2019s certainly present in your workplace. There. Now you can\u2019t claim ignorance as an excuse for jumping to the conclusion that the woman is probably lying.\n\nMy job is to see and hear things and then relay them to the public. I\u2019m not infallible as a reporter but I\u2019m pretty confident in my ability to be a primary source. Which is a fancy way of saying simply that I don\u2019t often wonder whether something that happened to me actually happened to me. I don\u2019t agonize in retrospect over whether or not I actually ate a bagel for breakfast if I think that I did because It would represent an existential breakdown in consciousness to distrust my own senses and memory like that.\n\nWhich is why on a personal level it created a stressful, frustrating dissonance to see the Astros slander as \u201cfabricated\u201d something that I knew to be true. This is a high-minded complaint about what ultimately proved to be a regrettable (and perhaps even regretted) impulsive defensiveness, but I think it\u2019s important to stress that what the Astros did in their initial statement was imply not just that they disagreed with Apstein\u2019s conclusion of Taubman\u2019s intent but that she and I and the other people they knew to be present are unreliable narrators about our own lives.\n\nThat Apstein made the story up is slander, that women or anyone \u2014 and especially reporters \u2014 should be distrusted as a default even regarding their own relatively recent experiences is an unhealthy and ultimately dangerous precedent. Even cynically speaking, the Astros\u2019 first response was to publicly undermine the trustworthiness of people who are empowered to make their product (which has no inherent value if people stop caring) widely accessible. It\u2019s just sports, but it\u2019s also part of an ominous trend in rendering facts as something other than that by simply refusing to treat them as such.\n\nAt every turn, the Astros have prioritized downplaying the situation \u2014 first disregarding the SI story out of hand, and, even after admitting that was wrong, remaining unwilling to even consider that it was indicative of anything larger. In addition to backfiring as a PR tactic, this should be seen as an indictment of their ability to self-police the internal culture of the team. Commitment to an inclusive and progressive work environment doesn\u2019t mean re-upping your bona fides at an annual unconscious bias seminar or even reacting correctly to public accusations. Stamping out the preexisting sexism in sports clubhouses requires being self-critical and proactive about the way teams treat female journalists. The Astros have shown that they\u2019re unwilling to do that.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "In their reactions to Brandon Taubman's outburst, the Astros have revealed an unacceptable set of priorities.", "authors": ["Hannah Keyser"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/neaCEf.2K6P9cTu_4_69Qg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NwgjuGT4FM.F2kc8oOsx2A--~B/aD0yNDUwO3c9MzY3NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/ba3156e0-f754-11e9-95fd-3bba35bc5731", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
