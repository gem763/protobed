The fight could set up a \"domino effect\" for smaller economies, according to a second IMF official.\n\n\"We urge policymakers around the world to continue to work together in order to resolve those trade tensions as that is significant source of uncertainty and a significant source of creation of downturn risks,\" he said. \"There are real spillover effects for emerging markets.\"\n\nThe time of the year could also have an impact on stocks.\n\n\u201cThe calendar could be about to turn into a bull\u2019s best friend, as late October has been when stocks historically started their end-of-year rally,\u201d says LPL Financial senior market strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\nLPL Financial Research\n\n\u201cNo two years are ever the same, and we all remember last year\u2019s sell-off.
