Revenue for the first nine months of the year in Hong Kong, however, rose 7 per cent.\n\nReuters", "description": "The bank has been looking to step up cost-cutting efforts amid a gloomier business outlook brought about by an escalating trade war, an easing monetary policy cycle, unrest in its key Hong Kong market, and Brexit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2749%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_5/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e14aa7716262acbb7e31bb22c9c7f0413bfc500b", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
