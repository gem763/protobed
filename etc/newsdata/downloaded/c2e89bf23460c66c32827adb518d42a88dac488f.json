Separate Census data, they said, reveal that the majority of people in these age groups who leave cities are moving to the suburbs.\n\nIn a separate WSJ article published earlier this year, Valerie Bauerlein wrote that millennials are reviving the suburbs as they flee cities in search of more affordable housing. They're following in baby boomers' footsteps, albeit belatedly \u2014 and on their own terms, being more selective about location.\n\nHousing is so unaffordable in big cities that residents are resorting to drastic measures to stay. In San Francisco and Chicago, people are living in cars and houseboats. Meanwhile, those in New York City are paying millions to live in basements, reported Stefanos Chen for The New York Times.\n\nRead more: More rich millennials are abandoning New York than any other state \u2014 and they're not the only ones fleeing the high cost of living\n\nMillennials of all wealth levels are fleeing expensive cities\n\nEven rich millennials are leaving expensive areas in droves. The high costs of living in New York City and San Francisco are pushing wealthy residents away from both cities, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nIn fact, a 2019 SmartAsset study found that New York is the No. 1 state rich millennials are moving from. The report used data from the IRS' 2015-2016 tax year to take a look at the states wealthy millennials were moving to and from. It defined rich millennials as people younger than 35 with an adjusted gross income of at least $100,000.\n\nIt found that rich millennials are seeking out states \u2014 like Colorado and Texas \u2014 that are home to more affordable cities.\n\nA separate SmartAsset report underscored these findings, using net migration data from the US Census Bureau to track the top cities millennials were settling in. It subtracted the number of people ages 20 to 34 who moved out of the city from the number of people in the same age range who moved into the same city in 2017.\n\nIt found that the southern portion of the United States dominated, with five cities making the top 10. Dallas, Texas, ranked No. 1. Colorado Springs, Colorado; Charlotte, North Carolina; Columbia, South Carolina; and Norfolk, Virginia, also made the list.", "description": "27,000 millennials moved away from major US cities in 2017, reported The Wall Street Journal.
