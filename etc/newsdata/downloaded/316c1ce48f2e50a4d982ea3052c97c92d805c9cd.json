There is a five-year period for phasing in new fees.\n\nCountries with more than 75,000 tonnes in post imported annually \u2013 mainly the United States \u2013 may apply their self-declared new rates from July 2020, UPU officials said.\n\n\u201cWe will begin our self-declared rates at the end of June next year. This is exactly what we wanted and planned for,\u201d the White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, who led the US delegation, told a Geneva news conference.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll buy less Chinese stuff, buy more from other countries, we will make more in America and the market will be free of distortions,\u201d he said, crediting Donald Trump.\n\nNavarro said that the current system meant the US Postal Service was in effect spending $300m to $500m to subsidise the cost of delivering imports, including goods mailed to the United States from China.\n\n\u201cChina is certainly going to pay more for the privilege of shipping to our market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u201chistoric victory\u201d was clinched in negotiations among 34 countries including China, he told reporters.\n\nChina\u2019s delegation backed the deal, telling the talks: \u201cFor China, we have always been actively working with all the members and trying to find a positive solution and compromise in the spirit of UPU.\u201d\n\nThe UPU director-general, Bishar Hussein, warned on Tuesday that any US departure from the 193-member agency would be a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d, with delivery of global mail disrupted and US stamps no longer being recognised abroad.\n\nHussein, speaking to reporters on Wednesday, welcomed the deal as preserving unity but conceded it would mean higher postal rates for some.\n\n\u201cToday what I witnessed is a historical moment where we averted possible exit of one of our member countries. I can tell you it was very tense,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOnce a country declares their rate, exporting countries will have to factor that cost; it means that cost will be transferred to the person sending that item ... When you are in a country and you buy items overseas, the end-customer will definitely have to pay a higher price.\u201c", "description": "Agreement to reform UN agency\u2019s fee structure comes after Trump administration threat and emergency talks", "authors": ["Reuters In Geneva"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76921f343585905d515221cb373edc5bafa1f90c/5_148_2749_1650/master/2749.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f614181a8e753c75b42c46b22b566c06", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
