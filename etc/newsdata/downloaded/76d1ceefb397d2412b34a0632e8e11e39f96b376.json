Everyone knows he did it. Pretending otherwise will get him impeached for sure. Admitting it and apologizing at least reduces the chances he\u2019ll be impeached and would improve the chances of senate GOP in 2020. https://t.co/0kE2tDbFO0 \u2014 Jonah Goldberg (@JonahDispatch) October 30, 2019\n\nCan we just say that we don\u2019t think Rep. Adam \u201cPencil Neck\u201d Schiff is looking for an apology down in his top-secret bunker?\n\nGoldberg writes at National Review:\n\nIn l\u2019affaire Ukraine, the president is guilty as charged. And the best strategy for him to avoid impeachment by the House and perhaps even removal by the Senate is to admit it, apologize, and let voters make their own judgment. It\u2019s also the best way to fend off a disaster for Senate Republicans. \u2026 This is why the smartest Trump defenders are counseling the president to simply admit the obvious: There was a quid pro quo, and the president\u2019s phone call fell short of perfection, but nothing he did is an impeachable offense. \u2026 I disagree with those who say that the allegations against Trump are not impeachable. But, politically, apologizing could forestall impeachment by giving politicians and voters a safe harbor: \u201cIt was wrong, but he said he\u2019s sorry. Move on.\u201d The longer the president defends a lie, the more Americans will resent being lied to.\n\nSo, what do you think? Bill Clinton asked the country for forgiveness and liberated his supporters to say the country should \u201cmove on.\u201d\n\nI am a fan, and frequently cited your columns as the most eloquent and forceful reasons to be #NeverTrump in 2015. So it is not easy for me to say that this take is total and utter bullsh!t. But it is. #ImpeachmentForWHAT \u2014 (((L.N. Smithee))) (@LNSmithee) October 30, 2019\n\nIt is the height of sophistry to suggest that the dishonest, clandestine process led by #Pelosi & #Schiff and promoted 24/7 by a corrupt media majority should be rewarded by a #Trump \"apology\" for a crime that neither you nor anybody else is able to specify. #ImpeachmentForWHAT \u2014 (((L.N. Smithee))) (@LNSmithee) October 30, 2019\n\nI said many times in the Obama era that as much as I thought he was the worst POTUS of my lifetime, calls for his impeachment were nonsensical because you shouldn't remove a CIC simply for sucking at the job. That's what elections are for. But as #Pelosi told Stephanopoulos 1/2 \u2014 (((L.N. Smithee))) (@LNSmithee) October 30, 2019\n\nback on 10/3/19, \"the re-election of Donald Trump would do irreparable damage to the United States,\" so she will unapologetically abuse the process to accomplish that. You may want to encourage her and #Schiff, Jonah. I will not. 2/2 https://t.co/gCOVwsCGFG #ImpeachmentForWHAT \u2014 (((L.N. Smithee))) (@LNSmithee) October 30, 2019\n\nYeah, considering they\u2019ve been plotting Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment even before he was inaugurated, we don\u2019t know as an apology would soften any hearts in The Resistance.\n\nLiberal Fascism was brilliant. Somewhere along the way you just lost your damn mind. \u2014 J.G. Petruna (@jgpetruna) October 30, 2019\n\nAmen. \u2014 Mark Langford (@marklangford) October 30, 2019\n\nThis is Kristol level wish casting. \u2014 Chrome Dinette (@Chrome_Dinette) October 30, 2019\n\n\"Apologize or be impeached!\" is peak cancel culture. Good job completing your transition, Jonah. \u2014 Frederick (@jmotivator) October 30, 2019\n\nYou're so worthless \u2014 eric (@eriContrarian) October 30, 2019\n\nput the pipe down, Jonah \u2014 kinda Spursy (@daviddgoodwin) October 30, 2019\n\nBS.. he did nothing wrong. We all read the transcript. Aid was not withheld nor was that even mentioned. You NeverTrumpers have lost your mind. If House does impeach it will die a fast deserved death in Senate \u2014 Tim (@tntDVM) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cI believe\u201d is a good deal less than that which is necessary to allege, and certainly not prove, high crimes and misdemeanors. You\u2019re flailing Jonah. I\u2019m laughing.\ud83e\udd23 \u2014 J.C. Pennington (@Shark_Four) October 30, 2019\n\nApologize for what? Good grief the anti-Trump crowd is now living in an alternate reality at this point. \u2014 Andrew Campbell (@camp_bean) October 30, 2019\n\nI beg to differ. I do not think \"he did it\". And I do not believe everyone knows he did not. He may be impeached, but it will be on faulty, one-sided, manufactured and deceitful evidence when the transcript shows that there were was NO quid pro quo. But, go ahead and gloat. \u2014 Bama Mom (@4gradsBama) October 30, 2019\n\nBy far and away the worst take I\u2019ve ever seen by Jonah. I\u2019m inclined to believe he\u2019s trolling \u2014 Matt H (@mmadhatter82) October 30, 2019\n\nNothing will reduce the chances of impeachment. The Dems have no way out now. And they certainly wouldn't exit an off-ramp provided by Trump. As to the Senate, that is much more dependent on whether Trump wins in 2020 and it is unclear how impeachment will impact that result. \u2014 Jeff Stillman (@StillmanJeff) October 30, 2019\n\nSure Jonah. He\u2019s damned if he does and damned if he doesn\u2019t. He won\u2019t be removed. \u2014 VaIarMorghuIis (@Appeal2DaStone) October 30, 2019\n\nIs this The Onion, sir? \u2014 Jay Aronson (@jaydaronson) October 30, 2019\n\nKowtowing to the left is never a winning strategy \u2014 SoothingDave (@SoothingDave) October 30, 2019\n\nWhat are the impeachment charges this week? \u2014 Alberic Utrecht (@LateToMass) October 30, 2019\n\nApologize for what? But, if an apology is offered it goes nowhere with the Left. They won\u2019t accept anything less than the complete destruction of the Republican Party. That\u2019s what separates Trump from previous Republicans. He knows what the Left\u2019s ultimate goal is & wont give in \u2014 jim lythgoe (@jhlythgoe) October 30, 2019\n\nTrump ate 2 scoops of ice cream. Everyone knows he ate it. He admitted it, and there are 5 witnesses willing to say how disgusted they were that he had the bravado to add an extra scoop But admitting to something that is not misconduct, means absolutely nothing. 2020 landslide \u2014 Ben Jammin \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@xBenJamminx) October 30, 2019\n\nDemocrats and NeverTrumpers want impeachment and won\u2019t settle for an apology. Look how long MoveOn has lasted, and its origin was to forget about Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment and just \u201cmove on.\u201d\n\nRelated:", "description": "We don't think the people who've been crying for impeachment from Day 1 are going to settle for an apology.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/trump_ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
