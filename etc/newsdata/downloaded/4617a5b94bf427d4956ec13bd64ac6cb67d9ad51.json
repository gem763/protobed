These are the signatures that last,\u201d said Jean-Claude Juncker, European Commission President.\n\nThe leaders put pen to paper in the Campidoglio palace, the very same place that the six founding states signed the Treaty of Rome in 1957 \u2013 launching the European Economic Community, the EU\u2019s forerunner.\n\nThe declaration promises to listen to citizens. Some have lots to say right now, with anti-EU protests having been planned around the anniversary event.\n\nBrexit has helped fuel eurosceptic nationalists challenging governments from Stockholm to Sicily.\n\nPope Francis said on Friday the EU had achieved a lot in six decades, but was facing a \u201cvacuum of values.\u201d\n\nHe condemned anti-immigrant populism and extremism, something he said posed a mortal threat to the bloc.\n\nReporting from Rome, Euronews\u2019 Gregoire Lory said: \u201cUnder the sun, here in the capital, the 27 Heads of State and Government have displayed their unity, and with their smiles, all the European leaders signed the Rome Declaration \u2013 60 years after the Treaty of the same name.\n\n\u201cFor the President of the European Commission, the document is simply a new beginning for the European project. The priority now is to turn those words into action.\u201d", "description": "EU leaders have joined together in Rome to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding treaty of the bloc.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/361573/1000x563_361573.jpg", "published_at": "2017-03-25"}
