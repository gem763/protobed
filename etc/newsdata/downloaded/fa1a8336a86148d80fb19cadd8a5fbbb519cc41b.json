(AP) - An Elkhart man with felony rape and child molestation convictions on his record has been charged with sexually assaulting an Amish woman last month in Marshall County.\n\nThe Elkhart Truth reports that 49-year-old Michael Middaugh is charged with rape, burglary with an armed weapon and criminal confinement.\n\nThe woman told the Marshall County Sheriff\u2019s Department that she was home with her 2-year-old child on Aug. 28 when a man pulled up in a car asking for directions before he grabbed her and raped her at knifepoint.\n\nWhen authorities released the woman\u2019s description of her attacker, the Elkhart County Sheriff\u2019s Office discovered that her description matched that of Middaugh, who was being sought because he failed to register as a sex offender. He was arrested Aug. 30 and remains in custody.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An Elkhart man with felony rape and child molestation convictions on his record has been charged with sexually assaulting an Amish woman last month in Marshall County.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/02/03/amish_horse_auction_23505_c0-600-4945-3483_s1770x1032.jpg?4793c5996f71f847acfad23bd330f2491b0041c6", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
