He hopes he can be a teacher who allows his players to express themselves.\u201cThe first step for me when I get to meet the players will be to create a good learning environment within the sport, and a good, safe atmosphere within the sport,\u201d Bell said at his introductory press conference at the Korea Football Association (KFA) House in Seoul on Tuesday, four days after he was announced as the new boss for the Taeguk Ladies.\u201cThat\u2019s the basis for success,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd then [I want] to implement the style of play that hopefully will be successful, using the attributes that Korean players have, and using the attributes of culture of Korea and bringing in European touch I obviously have and to combine these together to create a playing style that will be and should be active.\u201cI believe players in this generation are overcoached,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to have players who can express themselves and be a game changer.\u201dBell, the 58-year-old from England, is the first foreign national to coach the Korean women\u2019s team. After playing in the Bundesliga in the 1980s, Bell has spent three decades coaching.He\u2019d been the Irish women\u2019s team head coach from 2017 to June this year. Before accepting the Korean job, Bell was the assistant head coach for Huddersfield Town in the English Football League Championship.Bell said he liked the potential of the Korean team and the distance the KFA is willing to go to improve the program.\u201cThat was very attractive for me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you look at countries that have been successful, their football associations have invested and tried to do as much as they can to raise the quality of the game.\u201dBell said his vision is to help Korea take the next step. They have played at each of the past two FIFA Women\u2019s World Cups but failed to get beyond the first knockout round both times.\u201cQualifying for two times in the World Cup is a great foundation for me to work on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe aim and vision is to become more successful, not just to be able to qualify for tournaments, but also, when you get over the hurdle of qualification, then to be a force at tournaments and have a realistic chance of winning tournaments.\u201dBell said once he finds his footing, he will try to highlight the importance of \u201cpreparation and detail.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll try to dominate games, and the focus is to win,\u201d he said. \u201cThis sounds obvious, but it\u2019s not that easy when you play on the highest level. I want to create a mentality that we\u2019re going to the pitch and we expect to win. It doesn\u2019t matter who we play.\u201dOver his coaching career spanning 30 years, Bell said his teams have played \u201ccompact and organized\u201d defense, which helped set up attacking opportunities.\u201cFootball is a very complex sport,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal will be to simplify the game as much as possible and, in doing that, to increase the players\u2019 knowledge of the game. Of course, on the pitch, it\u2019s the players that are making the decisions. So I am very encouraging in that area.\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have a good learning environment, so that the girls can take on a lot of responsibility themselves on the pitch,\u201d Bell continued. \u201cMy job is to guide them and support them and bring them on to that next level. And I am confident that will happen.\u201dThe KFA invited Bell to the United States to watch Korea play the U.S. team, coming off their FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup title in June, in back-to-back friendly matches. Bell said he noticed how comfortable Koreans seemed with the ball, and that they were active and aggressive in their press in the second match as they held the Americans to a 1-1 draw.One area where Korea needs to improve is defending set pieces, Bell said.\u201cIt\u2019s easier said than done, but you have to try to avoid conceding free kicks and corners, and that can be done through good defensive play,\u201d he said.Yonhap", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
