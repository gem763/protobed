In recent years, cases of children falling into such wells have been recorded across the country, many of which led to arduous yet usually successful retrievals by paramilitary and rescue forces.\n\nLast week, state authorities dug a hole parallel to that in which Wilson had fallen in a bid to reach him. Rescuers pumped in oxygen only to find the child\u2019s decomposing body.\n\nThe death provoked anger in Wilson\u2019s village of Nadukattupatti in Tamil Nadu state, where villagers monitored the rescue attempt and later attended the boy\u2019s funeral.\n\nThe boy\u2019s family accused the local government of \u201cnegligent behavior\u201d but officials said rescue teams made all possible effort to pull the child out.", "description": "A two-year-old boy who fell into a well while playing outside his house in southern India died during an 80-hour-long rescue operation, state authorities said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
