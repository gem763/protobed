Speaking onstage at yesterday\u2019s launch event, Google Research\u2019s Marc Levoy explained the decision with a relatively simple statement of fact. \u201cSome subjects are farther away than you\u2019d like,\u201d he said, \u201cso it does help telephoto shots to have a telephoto lens.\u201d\n\nIt seems like a weirdly obvious point to make, but Levoy had to spell it out because until last year Google was claiming that its phones could get by with just a single rear camera. Check out this interview with Wired, where one of Google\u2019s product managers said that a second lens was \u201cunnecessary\u201d because of the company\u2019s expertise in machine learning. The Pixel 3 included a feature called \u201cSuper Res Zoom,\u201d which used a burst of photos to increase resolution while you\u2019re zoomed in; no telephoto lens required. For context, Apple had already been adding a second camera with a telephoto lens to its iPhones for two years.\n\n\u201cSome subjects are farther away than you\u2019d like, so it does help telephoto shots to have a telephoto lens\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s not alone in disparaging a competing product\u2019s features, only to have them crop up in its own products soon afterward. To a certain extent, that\u2019s just the reality of product marketing spin. Nevertheless, it\u2019s led to some memorable moments.\n\nMy favorite example of this is the first Pixel, which arrived a month after Apple had controversially dropped the headphone jack from the iPhone 7. Check out the trailer Google used to announce the phone below (the exact moment we\u2019re looking for is at 0:48, in case you\u2019re feeling lazy).\n\nIt\u2019s a great little joke! But just a year later Google had a change of heart and removed the 3.5mm headphone jack from the Pixel 2, and in doing so committed exactly the same sin it had mocked Apple for.\n\nIt was a similar story when Marc Levoy claimed the original Pixel didn\u2019t need optical image stabilization (it was later included on the Pixel 2), or when Google boasted that the original Pixel didn\u2019t have an \u201cunsightly camera bump\u201d (later found on the Pixel 2, 3, and 4).\n\nGoogle is hardly the only company that\u2019s had to quietly walk back its previous marketing with the announcement of a new product. There have been some very high-profile Apple examples over the years. Like back in 2010 when Steve Jobs famously said that \u201cif you see a stylus, they blew it\u201d only for the company to announce the Apple Pencil five years later. Apple also said it didn\u2019t see the value in a video iPod, NFC, or wireless charging, and we know how those proclamations turned out.\n\nSimilarly, just as Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note \u201cphablets\u201d started gobbling up market share, Apple declared that its iPhones were superior because they could be easily navigated one-handed by \u201cthe magical device we all carry called a horizontally opposed thumb.\u201d It\u2019s a design axiom that\u2019s since been abandoned in an era of Plus and Max-sized iPhones.\n\nSpeaking of Samsung, the company hilariously mocked the iPhone X\u2019s notch in 2017, only to return with its own notched displays a year later. And who can forget the Note 9 ads that poked fun at the iPhone\u2019s lack of a headphone jack, before the Note 10 was the first of Samsung\u2019s flagships to ship without one.\n\nSometimes there are good reasons for a company to change its mind, like back in 2017 when Microsoft said that the USB-C connector wasn\u2019t ready to be included on its mainstream laptops. Its reasoning was a combination of customer confusion and a relatively immature ecosystem of \u201cdongle-life\u201d accessories. The company may have dragged its heels a little since then, but sure enough, this year\u2019s Surface devices finally included the port.\n\nThe same can be said about the slow demise of the headphone jack. When Apple found the \u201ccourage\u201d to ditch the headphone jack with the iPhone 7, wireless headphones were yet to go mainstream. This ended up looking like a pretty cynical move considering Apple was willing to upsell you a $159 pair of wireless AirPods. In 2019, the lack of a headphone jack can still be annoying, but now that wireless headphones are much more common it doesn\u2019t sting quite so badly.\n\nThis year, Google claims it doesn\u2019t need a wide-angle camera\n\nSometimes there are good reasons to delay hardware changes. Maybe they\u2019re too expensive to manufacture at the scale that a company operates, pushing the price of a product beyond what people are willing to pay. Maybe the new tech is simply too power-intensive, too niche, or just user-hostile and stupid. Other times the market ends up changing beyond recognition, making old assumptions irrelevant. These are all good reasons! But admitting that isn\u2019t much fun.\n\nLook, these companies know that product announcements are a game, and who here doesn\u2019t enjoy seeing corporate millionaires lightly ribbing each other? Product road maps are measured in years, not months. When one company stands onstage making fun of the design choices of another, they often know full well that they\u2019ll be rolling out the same soon enough. But today, they\u2019ve got phones to sell!\n\nThis year, it\u2019s wide-angle cameras that Google says its phones don\u2019t need, despite plenty of people finding them pretty useful and something that can\u2019t be approximated by software. One month ago, Apple focused on the benefits of a new wide-angle lens it added to the iPhone 11, but yesterday Google said it thinks the opposite is true. \u201cWhile wide-angle can be fun we think telephoto is more important,\u201d Levoy said. Considering Google\u2019s track record, Marc Levoy\u2019s throwaway statement about wide-angle cameras probably all but guarantees that the Pixel 5 will come with one (wink wink).\n\nThe only question now is which feature Google will then have to justify not including next year.", "description": "With the Pixel 4, Google has finally added a second lens to the back of its phones for telephoto shots.
