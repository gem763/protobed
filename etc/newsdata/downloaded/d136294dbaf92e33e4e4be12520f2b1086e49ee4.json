I think a lot of us would like to get to the bottom of that.\n\nThis is why Trump said to President Zelensky: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people \u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\n(How\u2019d you like to be the Ukrainian translator for a Trump conversation?)\n\nTrump has been justly criticized for hiring his daughter and son-in-law at the White House. But at least when he pressures a foreign leader for a favor, it\u2019s to investigate corruption, not to get a prosecutor off his son\u2019s back. Maybe Biden\u2019s son was guilty, maybe he was innocent. But it is a fact that Joe Biden held up foreign aid to a desperately needy ally in exchange for their halting prosecution that implicated his son. It\u2019s not Trump\u2019s fault that Biden is now running for president.\n\nI\u2019ll give the Democrats this: They\u2019ve gotten so good at trying to remove Trump from office that, instead of three years, their insane accusations blow up in their faces within a week.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ann Coulter", "Dailycaller.Com Coulter-Trump-Mount-Rushmore"], "top_image": ""}
