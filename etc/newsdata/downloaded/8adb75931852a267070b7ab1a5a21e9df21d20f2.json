Up to 18,000 infrastructure and construction projects have as a result been stalled, including the opening of Lelystad Airport next year. The government is also being advised to cut speed limits to reduce pollution.\n\nBut most of the nitrogen that ends up in the environment comes from farms, and they\u2019re being asked to bear the brunt of the costs. Tjeerd de Groot, an MP from the center-left coalition D66 party, proposed reducing nitrogen emissions by halving the country\u2019s livestock population \u2014 cutting the number of pigs by 6 million and chickens by 50 million.\n\nFurious farmers reacted on Tuesday by driving their tractors to The Hague, causing rush hour traffic chaos.\n\n\u201cWe feel as if we\u2019re being put in the dunces\u2019 corner by city types who come and tell us how things should be in the countryside,\u201d one of the protest organizers, Mark van den Oever, told Trouw newspaper, adding that farmers shouldn\u2019t be blamed for the nitrogen issue.\n\nThe Netherlands is the world's second-largest agricultural exporter after the U.S. But it's a much smaller country, which means that farms are nestled close to protected nature areas.\n\nThe Natura 2000 network, which stretches over 18 percent of the EU\u2019s land mass, is a bloc-wide scheme meant to protect natural areas. The Netherlands has more than 160 such areas, and EU rules mandate that they are protected.\n\nBut 70 percent of the country's surface area exceeds critical limits for nitrogen, according to government data.\n\nExcess nitrogen in the atmosphere can produce pollutants such as ammonia and ozone, which affect health, limit visibility and alter plant growth. Nitrogen oxides \u2014 emitted by car exhausts, farm soils, livestock and fertilizers, as well as the generators, diggers and other equipment on building construction sites \u2014 can also harm the health of forests, soils and waterways, and can act as an indirect greenhouse gas.\n\nIn 2015 the government tried to rein in pollution with a plan that allowed for additional nitrogen emissions as long as it was compensated at a later date.\n\nBut the May ruling from the Council of State found that wasn\u2019t enough, and effectively halted every project which could lead to an increase in nitrogen emissions \u2014 from new chicken sheds to entire residential developments.\n\nLast week, an advisory commission urged the government to adopt a broad package of measures including lowering the speed limit on some roads, and buying out and closing older farms to reduce emissions.\n\nJohan Remkes, who led the commission, said the Dutch government has to make some tough choices. \u201cDriving a little more slowly from A to B does not make much difference\u201d to travel times in the Netherlands, but will mean a substantial reduction in emissions, he said.\n\nThe commission is due to present a second report in May with advice on long-term measures.\n\nRemkes said it would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d for the government to try to look for loopholes, calling for \u201ca credible and demonstrable restoration\u201d of 118 nitrogen-sensitive Natura 2000 areas and a reduction of nitrogen pollution.", "description": "Farmers are angry at being the main target of efforts to slash nitrogen pollution.", "authors": ["Eline Schaart", "Zia Weise", "Zosia Wanat"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1172704680-1200x628.jpg"}
