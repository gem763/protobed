Many cities and some states though celebrated it as Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day. Recently, Governor Tony Evers of Wisconsin, through an executive order, decreed that Wisconsin would celebrate the second Monday of every October in honour of this land\u2019s original inhabitants, the American Indians. It goes without saying that this has triggered a public debate in the United States.\n\nWhich leads to the question: Who is an American? Is it the people who natively inhabited these continents, who were brutally annihilated by settlers, and are now politely called \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d? Is it the swathes of religious refugees escaping the tyranny of the crown in England and seeking safe haven along the Atlantic Board?\n\nIs it the generations that have flocked the U.S. from overseas over the past several decades and have scaffolded the country\u2019s healthcare system, software architecture, and business enterprise on which society\u2019s collective welfare depends?\n\nOr, at a more tangible level, is it the millions of Latin-Americans who keep our daily lives well-oiled \u2013 as janitors, truckmen, servers at a favourite food joint, nannies, construction workers, and more? They are not stealing jobs from U.S. citizens. They are just filling up a labour-supply equation. There are not enough U.S. citizens willing to do these jobs. The work needs to be done though. Immigrants, willing to work a lower wage, take them up.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear. Unless you are of Native American descent, everyone here in the United States of America is an immigrant. Natural-born citizen, naturalized citizen, permanent resident, student, or temporary worker, we are all here as pilgrims. We are someone from somewhere. So, what makes some of us better than the other? As long as you are a law-abiding, tax-paying individual, there is no reason why you should feel less \u2018American\u2019 than another.\n\nRecently, a student group at the University of Maine, where I teach journalism, held a meeting and denounced indigenous people as \u2018savages\u2019. This called for the President of UMaine and its Dean of Students to issue the following statement:\n\n\u201cWe are writing to provide the University of Maine position on recent Facebook posts by the UMaine College Republicans on their private Facebook page.\n\nThe positions reflected and reposted on that page are neither supported by nor reflective of the University of Maine\u2019s values and principles of inclusivity and equity.\n\nFor those of you who are not aware, the Facebook post uses 15th-century Spanish war propaganda to dehumanize indigenous peoples, implying all indigenous peoples of the Americas are brutal savages.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, such sentiments expressed by our students are not unique and do not exist in a vacuum. There are several iterations of it all over America today. They thrive in an atmosphere where uninformed, impassioned rhetoric across the political spectrum trumps reason and facts. The presidencies post 2000 in the US have polarized the country, perhaps unparalleled in its history. Sure, there were deep, often violent, divisions during the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, during the Vietnam War, and the Iran oil crisis. But thanks to an instantaneous, intense media consumption culture, driven and defined by social media, George W Bush\u2019s presidency that sanctioned the disastrous Iraq war, and Barack Obama\u2019s, which presided over the ill-fated \u2018Obamacare\u2019\u2014an exemplar of partisan politics on the Hill at the cost of public interest \u2013 perilously frayed America\u2019s legendary democratic fabric. The refusal of elected Democrats and Republicans to reach across the aisle and negotiate in the interest of U.S. citizens\u2019 better interests has set the clock back on the country\u2019s many progresses over the centuries.\n\nNone of these past administrations, though, have ripped apart the tapestry of the land of the free and the home of the brave like President Donald Trump\u2019s machinery. A leader is as good as his people, so let us not blame Trump alone. He is just channeling what has bubbled under the surface of this great nation for decades \u2013 the unresolved prejudices and artifice of democratic equality among its citizens. Be it the vitriol against African-Americans and immigrants of color, the scant respect for women and people who are not White and wealthy, ill-advised foreign policy, or the national promulgation and worship of ignorance, this period has to mark a watershed in world history.\n\nThe U.S. Presidential election cycle is a long-drawn spectacle that is played out via its robust, free media. It has already begun, per tradition, more than a year in advance of the day Americans ballot. President Trump, as of now, is a shoo-in for the Republican candidacy. The Democrats are going through an elaborate exercise to find their standard-bearer. In fact, they are going through a soul-search to determine who they are and stand for in today\u2019s times.\n\nThe gloves are off. It will only get nastier, if that were possible. As politicians indulge in a destructive revelry, those who stand to lose are US citizens \u2013 and the promise of this nation\u2019s Constitution. The people of the United States of America, despite their stark differences, have traditionally bandied together for the cause their Founding Fathers first came here and is enshrined in the Declaration of Independence \u2013 Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all. Will today\u2019s United States abide by its raison-d\u2019etre?", "description": "This past Monday in the United States marked Columbus Day, an annual Federal holiday that has been celebrated since 193 in honour of the Italian sailor finding the New World.
