XOM, +0.51% , which is based in Irving, Texas, of misleading investors about its financial health as governments impose stricter regulations to combat global warming.\n\n\u201cExxon Mobil did nothing wrong. Absolutely nothing wrong,\u201d Wells said. \u201cThe evidence will show that the allegations in the complaint are bizarre and twisted and not connected to the reality of the truth.\u201d\n\nExxon has not always applied the appropriate regulation costs when estimating the increasing price of climate rules on its carbon-intensive business, said Kevin Wallace, an attorney arguing for New York\u2019s Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nIn some cases, Exxon used existing local regulations to calculate the cost of new projects, when it should have assumed regulations would become stricter, and more costly, over time, Wallace said.\n\n\u201cThe company failed to manage the risks in the ways it promised,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cThe cost of that failure is staggering.\u201d\n\nWallace asked for a comprehensive review and $476 million to $1.6 billion in damages to shareholders.\n\n\u201cHaving been misled on these issues, investors are entitled to an accurate picture,\u201d Wallace said.\n\nWells countered that Exxon has two distinct ways of accounting for increasingly strict climate regulations. One metric, called \u201cproxy costs,\u201d deals with the demand side of Exxon\u2019s business, and attempts to predict how demand for oil and gas may decrease around the world due to regulations. Another measure, known as \u201cGHG costs,\u201d or greenhouse gas costs, measures how local regulators may tax, for example, emissions from a refinery.\n\nExxon examines those costs, where appropriate, when it evaluates new projects, to determine the project\u2019s viability, Wells said.\n\n\u201cThis notion that we would be using lower costs than are appropriate, it makes no sense,\u201d Wells said. \u201cWe would not be in the business of cheating ourselves.\u201d\n\nWells also said the state\u2019s planned witnesses could not have been materially harmed as they claimed, because they were not making investment decisions.", "description": "Exxon Mobil says it has prepared itself for the impact that climate change regulations will have on its finances, denying allegations from New York\u2019s...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GT593_exxon1_ZG_20181030140349.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
