It even took me a while to even think of a totally non-violent game at all, much less one I\u2019d actually played. Initially I thought of my favourite racing games, but actually they\u2019re fairly violent themselves. From cars ramming me off the road, Burnout style crash scenarios, and WipEout\u2019s missiles and mines they are often just as bloodthirsty and destructive as any beat \u2018em-up or shoot \u2018em-up. For all its family friendly presentation and colourful, cartoonish graphical style, Mario Kart is basically Mad Max meets Death Race with a U-rating.\n\nFor ages, the only things I could think of that fit the bill were timeless puzzle classics Tetris and Columns, both of which are essentially things that you think, \u2018I\u2019ll have a 5 minute blast on that\u2019 and end up losing a whole day to beating your own high scores. They\u2019re both so simple to grasp, for anyone, of any age, but so fiendishly hard to put down once you\u2019ve started they\u2019re virtually pure examples of how compelling and bewitching video games can be.\n\nMy experiences of both mostly stem from the early 90s portable gaming scene. Between those two and the decidedly non-puzzley California Games on the Lynx I lost a lot of my early teens to perfectly enjoyable, non-violent gaming pursuits. I\u2019m not usually a puzzle game fan. I don\u2019t dislike them, I\u2019m just seldom drawn to them over other, more action, and apparently violence, oriented games.\n\nLooking over my game collection, I began to realise that, much like my film collection, I own almost nothing where something or someone doesn\u2019t have to die at some point, usually through some kind of violent act. Even Nintendo\u2019s flagship, family friendly standard bearers involve stamping sentient mushrooms or unsuspecting turtles out of existence somewhere along the line.\n\nIn trying to find things from the more modern age, I settled on a small, but I feel strong selection of three. Although at least one of them definitely has a violent element so might not count. However, if you ignore the boxing, I truly feel that Wii Sports is a classic. The tennis, bowling, and golf still get played, especially at Christmas with my parents, both of whom are tennis and bowling ninjas. Sure it\u2019s competitive (I can\u2019t beat either of them anymore, they\u2019ve got so much more time to practice than me since they\u2019re both retired) but, at least in the game world, no one gets hurt, shot, stabbed, bashed or killed.\n\nMy other two suggestions are Flower and Journey. I\u2019ve not played either in a long time as my PlayStation 3 is dead, so, especially in Journey\u2019s case I\u2019m possibly wrong about them containing no violence at all, but both were beautiful and very unlike anything else I\u2019d ever bought before or played. Flower\u2019s feeling of rushing through the fields gathering petals behind you as you went was such a refreshing high. I don\u2019t recall ever playing a game quite like it and I felt there was a lovely balance between freedom of exploration and loosely defined objectives, which made it a fantastic way to chill out and restore a sense of calm.\n\nSimilarly, Journey does exactly what it says on the tin. It takes you from somewhere to somewhere else via a breathtaking and often surprising world along the way. Not once do I remember it requiring me to board a gunship and mow down a small army or devastate a city with an array of heavy artillery, pillaged from the corpses of fallen mercenaries or fantastical beasts in order to get there.\n\nRather than appealing to a base desire for bloodshed or presenting an avenue to release pent up rage by wailing on some hench goons with your chosen avatar these games lure you onwards with the promise of new discoveries and as yet unseen beauty. They don\u2019t present you with the horrors of war or give you gut wrenching moral decisions to make on a regular basis, they take you on a glorious virtual holiday in some far off fantasy land filled with vibrant wonder.\n\nI\u2019m now trying to imagine how those two would work in VR. It\u2019s bringing a warm, happy smile to my face!\n\nyourhomeisatrisk", "description": "GameCentral readers discuss their favourite games that feature little to no violence, from Unfinished Swan to Flower.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Journey_20150723194908_thumb-f6bc_1572040749.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
