There\u2019s no privilege to be corrupt.\u201d\n\nMr. Schiff is demanding the administration turn over the complaint that alleges the president made an unspecified \u201cpromise\u201d to an unspecified foreign head of state during a phone conversation sometime this summer. Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson deemed the complaint credible and of \u201curgent concern,\u201d turning heads on Capitol Hill.\n\nMr. Trump on Thursday rejected accusations that he made an inappropriate \u201cpromise\u201d to a foreign leader, saying he wouldn\u2019t be \u201cdumb enough\u201d to take such action while other officials were monitoring his conversations.\n\n\u201cVirtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nMr. Trump added, \u201cKnowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u2018heavily populated\u2019 call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\u201d\n\nThe president characterized the report as \u201canother Fake News story out there \u2014 It never ends!\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower is being represented by Andrew P. Bakaj, a former CIA officer and managing partner at the Compass Ross Legal Group, a national security law firm, Politico reported.\n\nSome analysts say there are legitimate questions around the balance of power and what acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is required to disclose, given presidential powers.\n\nRobert Litt, formerly general counsel to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence under the Obama administration, noted that former President Bill Clinton asserted the right to executive privilege in a signing statement when he signed into law the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998.\n\n\u201cThe executive branch has always maintained that it does not consider the statutory language mandatory,\u201d Mr. Litt wrote on the Lawfare blog. \u201cIn signing the original President Clinton stated that it \u2018does not constrain my constitutional authority to review and, if appropriate, control disclosure of certain classified information to Congress.\u2019 President Obama reiterated this limitation in 2010. Congress no doubt disagrees with this interpretation, but the president\u2019s ultimate control over classified information has been a consistent position of every administration.\u201d\n\nMr. Atkinson also has agreed to appear in an open session with lawmakers on Sept. 26.\n\nMr. Schiff is scolding Mr. Maguire for refusing to share details of the complaint filed Aug. 12, saying he is required to notify committees because of the IG\u2019s determination.\n\n\u201cGiven the inspector general said, \u2018this is urgent,\u2019 it can\u2019t wait,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cEven if you could make a colorable claim of privilege over the subject matter of the complaint, given that it involves something that the IG has already found to be serious and credible and evidence of wrongdoing on one kind or another, there is no privilege that covers that. There\u2019s no privilege to conceal that. We can\u2019t get an answer because the Department of Justice and the director of National Intelligence will not authorize the IG to tell us.\u201d\n\nRep. Jackie Speier, California Democrat who attended the briefing, called the administration\u2019s actions \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and \u201ca violation of the law.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
