Traffic", "language": "en", "text": "Climate protesters took to the streets in downtown Washington, D.C. on Friday and they say it will not be the last time.\n\nThe \"Shut Down DC\" protest, which caused traffic disruptions in the downtown area, comes after the group also had a larger event on Monday, which also saw traffic jams all over the city. Shut Down DC planned the second protest because they were unsatisfied that Congress was not spurred into taking drastic action to address climate change.\n\nThe Shut Down DC climate protesters are doing another March through the streets and temporarily halting traffic again. pic.twitter.com/vPD8dPrSch \u2014 Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) September 27, 2019\n\n\"We'll do it as many times as needed to, to bring business as usual to a halt so that we can get real change here in our policies here in D.C.,\" activist Michael Beer told Townhall. \"Our major focus is on the federal government. The residents of D.C. and the D.C. government are not our target.\"\n\nCollege student Julia, who was not at Monday's protest, agreed they will be out in the streets \"as many times as necessary\" to have the federal government take action on climate change.\n\nApproximately 150-200 people took part in the march, which stopped at locations such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the city's Trump International Hotel, and Wells Fargo.\n\nWhen they stopped outside of the Trump Hotel, protesters called for President Donald Trump's impeachment not only because of his behavior, but also because the planet only has 11 years left to take action on climate change.\n\nOutside of Trump Hotel, a Shut Down DC climate protester says Trump needs to be impeached not only because of his behavior, but also because the world only has 11 years left to take action. pic.twitter.com/QnO8FFFM4w \u2014 Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) September 27, 2019\n\n\"I feel that I can say confidently that there are many people who are here who would say that they'd be willing to be out here as many times as necessary to get the government's attention and to get people to realize things need to change,\" activist Alastair told Townhall.\n\nA media representative for the group addressed the criticism of having cars idle for longer periods of time, saying it is needed because if everyone at the protest went vegan, stopped driving, stopped flying, and only wore hemp clothes, \"we still wouldn't make a goddamn dent, pardon my language, in the climate crisis. So a few idling cars, if it forces them to wake up, is more than worth it.\"\n\nAt Monday's march, over 26 people were arrested by police for blocking traffic, though it appeared no one was arrested on Friday.\n\n\"Shut Down DC\" demands include implementing a Green New Deal that changes \"our economy to 100% clean, renewable energy by 2030 and phase out all fossil fuel extraction through a just and equitable transition, creating millions of good jobs.\"", "description": ".09/27/2019 21:00:41PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/270/92781e84-e24c-4fa9-9235-9c5bb448be65.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
