(Nati Harnik/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nWashington is being roiled by another Trump controversy. And this one appears to have enough staying power to affect the 2020 presidential race.\n\nAll we really know at this point is that a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower, in part, concerns a July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to The Post, the whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u201cinvolved communications with a foreign leader and a \u2018promise\u2019 that Trump made.\u201d The president himself has admitted discussing with Zelensky opening an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The complaint\u2019s mere existence has emboldened Democrats and has made their case for impeachment look stronger while Republicans are waiting for more shoes to drop. Meanwhile, even if Trump is left standing, this latest development could finally doom Biden\u2019s political career. What is bad for Trump may be even worse for Biden, one of the leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nWithout knowing the full extent of what did or did not happen, Republicans\u2019 defense of the president is sure to involve a fair share of \u201cwhataboutism.\u201d That Hunter Biden was engaged in swamp business par excellence is already well-documented, and there are questions about whether Joe Biden has ever used his position to help his son. So all this points to Biden\u2019s vulnerability and reminds everyone that he has been in the swamp far too long.\n\nThe coming finger-pointing by Republicans and the demand for answers from Biden could not come at a worse time for his campaign. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is gaining traction and getting a fresh look from voters. The latest poll from Iowa shows her inching ahead of Biden. Voters may think Biden isn\u2019t just too old to be president, but that maybe he carries too much baggage to be the party\u2019s nominee, as well. In the strangest of ways, the whistleblower incident is more likely to end the political career of Biden before that of Trump.\n\nBiden is a fragile front-runner and the whole matter involving his son\u2019s foreign business dealings not only raises unflattering questions but provides plenty of reminders about his life in the swamp. Trump, on the other hand, is exceptionally durable with his base, to say nothing of the fact that his entire presidency has practically been defined by his ability to outlive Democratic \u201cwitch hunts.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats have been itching to impeach the president and this may be their best chance, though, so far, it doesn\u2019t appear Trump committed a criminal act. Maybe there is something truly substantial in the whistleblower complaint, or maybe we are just witnessing the latest example of hyperbole and fraught partisanship being pushed forward by Democrats and their allies. Maybe this time, Trump has really crossed the line by acting with extremely bad judgment \u2014 in his own self interest and in a way that weakened an important U.S. alliance for no good reason. Whatever it is, the latest Trump debacle seems to be a gift from the president to every Democrat who isn\u2019t named Joe Biden.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: In Ukraine, Trump\u2019s allies are corrupt oligarchs and Russian stooges\n\nHenry Olsen: This Ukraine scandal would be a bigger deal if Trump wasn\u2019t constantly attacked\n\nChris Whipple: Joseph Maguire should remember that he also answers to Congress\n\nCatherine Rampell: Trump isn\u2019t the only person responsible for the demise of American democracy", "description": "How the president's phone call to Ukraine could affect the 2020 election.", "authors": ["Ed Rogers", "Opinion Writer Focusing On Politics", "Opinion Writer", "September At Pm", "Ed Rogers Is A Contributor To Post Opinions", "A Political Consultant", "A Veteran Of The Ronald Reagan", "George H.W.
