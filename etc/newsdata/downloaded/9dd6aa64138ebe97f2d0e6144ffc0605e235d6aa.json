SpaceX\n\nThe spacecraft, shaped a bit like R2-D2 from the \"Star Wars\" movies, appeared to reach its FAA-approved 492-foot (150-meter) altitude limit, moved sideways and slowly descended to an on-target touchdown at a nearby landing pad. The approximately one-minute flight was the rocket's second \"untethered\" test following a July jump to an altitude of about 65 feet.\n\nSoaring to an altitude of about 500 feet, the Starhopper test vehicle slewed sideways before descending. SpaceX\n\nThe hardware SpaceX is testing is intended for a fully reusable two-stage vehicle featuring a powerful first stage, dubbed the Super Heavy Rocket, and the winged Starship.\n\nAfter an approximately one-minute flight, the test vehicle safely landed. SpaceX\n\nThe hopper is a sub-scale version of the Starship's propulsion system, the first to utilize a SpaceX-designed Raptor engine burning cryogenic methane with liquid oxygen.\n\nSpaceX said the new booster-Starship system eventually will replace the company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets as well as the Cargo and Crew Dragon capsules used to deliver supplies and, eventually, astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\n\"SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy Rocket are designed to deliver satellites to Earth orbit and beyond, at a lower marginal cost per launch than our current Falcon vehicles,\" the company says on its website.\n\nWith a 30-foot-wide payload compartment, the Starship will be able to launch larger payloads to Earth orbit than current rocket systems and deliver crews and supplies to the space station, the company says, adding that in the long term, Starship also will be able to deliver crews and cargo to the moon and, eventually, Mars.\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk has said the company's \"aspirational goal\" is to launch an initial cargo mission to Mars in 2022, followed by a crewed flight as early as 2024. Musk is expected to deliver an update on the rocket's development soon and those targets could change.\n\nMusk congratulated the team in a tweet Tuesday night:", "description": "The Starhopper is testing propulsion systems that will be used in SpaceX's planned heavy lift Starship spacecraft", "authors": ["William Harwood", "Bill Harwood Has Been Covering The U.S. Space Program Full-Time Since", "First As Cape Canaveral Bureau Chief For United Press International", "Now As A Consultant For Cbs News.
