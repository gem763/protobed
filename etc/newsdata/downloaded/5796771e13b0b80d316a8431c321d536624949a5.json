After swishing his final three attempts he jogs over to her.\n\n\u201cThanks, coach,\u201d Edwards says before exchanging a high-five with Lawson.\n\nWelcome to the new-look NBA, in which women\u2019s footprints are directly impacting every aspect of the game - from broadcasting booths, to officiating, coaching on the sidelines, front-office executives to ownership.\n\nLawson is one of a record 11 women serving as assistant coaches in the NBA this season. While former WNBA star Swin Cash and Sue Bird are working in NBA front offices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a fad,\u201d said Basketball Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman. \u201cIt\u2019s opportunities going to very accomplished women who have given their life to the game.\u201d\n\nWhile it may not be a fad, it is a recent trend.\n\nLieberman remembers a time when the presence of women was hard to spot, or at best found only behind the scenes.\n\nThe 61-year-old - who has broken barriers as a player, as a coach in the WNBA, head coach in NBA G League and in the NBA as assistant - learned quickly that building relationships was the skeleton key to erasing gender hurdles and opening opportunities in the league. That, along with an occasional assist from forward thinking men like former coach Don Nelson, who in 2009 hired her as the head coach of the Texas Legends, the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 G League affiliate.\n\nSeveral have continued Nelson\u2019s vision, including San Antonio Spurs Greg Popovich, who made Becky Hammon the NBA\u2019s first full-time assistant in 2014; current Mavericks\u2019 coach Rick Carlisle (he hired Jenny Boucek as assistant in 2017) and the Sacramento Kings organization, which has been responsible for hiring three women as assistants (Lieberman, Boucek and Lindsay Harding). Even the BIG3, spearheaded by founder and entertainer Ice Cube, is helping normalize the idea of women leading men, Lieberman said.\n\n\u201cI remember Donnie did an interview and he said, \u2018Maybe the best man for the job isn\u2019t a man at all.\u2019 He had a list of criteria he wanted to hit for his head coach. And I hit those,\u201d Lieberman said.\n\nThe women who have broken into the NBA ranks are garnering respect from players for their experience and basketball knowledge.\n\nCeltics guard Gordon Hayward said Lawson has already made her presence felt.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been good as far as just the experience she has as a basketball player,\u201d Hayward said. \u201cReading the game and kind of little things she sees coaching on the sideline. Having somebody that well-versed in basketball, that experience is good.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Wizards assistant Kristi Toliver was on the court helping the Mystics win their first WNBA championship. On the sideline, Washington NBA All-Stars John Wall and Bradley Beal were wearing the Wizard assistant\u2019s WNBA jersey and dancing from the stands .\n\nNBA players are treating the feedback from Toliver and the other women in the league with the same reverence they give their male counterparts.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing I learned is to share your voice and what you\u2019ve learned,\u201d Toliver said. \u201cDoing that has helped me communicate with my guys.\u201d\n\nToliver is in a unique salary situation since she coaches for the Washington Wizards and plays for the Washington Mystics - both owned by same franchise. She was only paid about $10,000 with the Wizards last year because of WNBA salary cap rules. WNBA teams can only pay all their players a combined $50,000 in offseason to supplement pay and Washington only had $10,000 left to pay Toliver.\n\nThere are no such hiccups in New Orleans, where Pelicans guard Frank Jackson said he always expected to benefit from Cash and Teresa Weatherspoon, who was hired as a New Orleans assistant this season.\n\n\u201cThey were ballers,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThey were good at their craft and I\u2019ve taken a lot from both of them. \u2026 I\u2019ve always had open eyes and open ears to anyone who plays this game.\u201d\n\nThe 21-year-old Jackson knows of the women\u2019s exploits because he has witnessed it firsthand. And he is not alone. The WNBA has been around since most players were teenagers, and is older than others; the league was launched in 1996.\n\n\u201cAs the years go on, they\u2019re going to get more and more recognition,\u201d said Jackson, in his third year out of Duke. \u201cGirls can hoop, too. \u2026 I just think as times change, you\u2019ll see more and more.\u201d\n\nCash believes the NBA is realizing having more women is important to growing the league\u2019s overall brand, business and bottom line.\n\n\u201cThe reality is and the statistics prove it, is that having women included in your business helps you get more inclusion, helps you get the diversity you need,\u201d she said. \u201cDiversity of thought, not just Black, White, Asian, Latino, whatever.\u201d\n\nStephanie Ready, a former assistant in the then D-League, said a big factor in the opportunities women are getting are coming because the younger generation of NBA executives, such as 76ers general manager Elton Brand. She said the new crop of hiring managers are doing a better job of recognizing what women bring to the table and as the older generation retires, it will get even better.\n\n\u201cSome people will age out,\u201d said Ready, one of the first women to be a men\u2019s assistant on the collegiate level with Coppin State and a former broadcaster with the Charlotte Hornets who now currently covers the NBA for TNT and Yahoo. \u201cBy that I mean the old regime of men who thought that only men could do these jobs.\u201d\n\nRichard Lapchick, who tracks racial and gender hiring numbers for the NBA, NFL, NHL and MLB, has long lauded the NBA as being the leader in gender hiring practices. He credits the leadership of Commissioner Adam Silver, who said the league needed to increase the number women coaches and referees in the NBA.\n\nAlong with the record number of female assistants, five women referees will be working NBA games this upcoming season.\n\nLapchick also believes the NBA will soon have its female head coach. Whether that is Hammon in San Antonio remains to be seen. But whoever it is, Lapchick said the move would go a long way in putting even more women in position to make basketball decisions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if it doesn\u2019t happen before the next season,\u201d he said, \u201cor during the next season.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Basketball Writer Brian Mahoney and AP Sports Writers Doug Feinberg in New York and Brett Martel in New Orleans contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Practice is over and Boston Celtics assistant coach Kara Lawson is still working.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kyle Hightower"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/nba_women_influence_basketball_04973_c0-99-2059-1300_s1200x700.jpg?e10b4622d5703edfbcb0cc6b2f106d4d1c0959bf", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
