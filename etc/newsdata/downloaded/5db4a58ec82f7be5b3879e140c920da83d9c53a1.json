On an annual basis, it held at 1.6% against the RBA's target band of 2% to 3%.\n\nThe two key measures of underlying inflation \u2014 trimmed mean and weighted median \u2014 also undershot the RBA's goal, averaging around 1.4% for the year.", "description": "The most significant price falls in the quarter were automotive fuel and fruits and vegetables, while international holidays, tobacco and childcare had the largest increases.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105738595-1550128920338gettyimages-922737896.jpeg?v=1550128984", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
