They can either shift qualifying to Sunday morning, something that was done successfully at Suzuka in 2004 and 2010 because of bad weather, or they can use the timings of the drivers from Friday afternoon\u2019s second free practice to determine the starting order.\n\nWhatever happens, a postponement of the grand prix to Monday is impossible, the FIA said.\n\n- Safety first -\n\nAfter the tail-end of a typhoon affected the 2014 race at Suzuka, French driver Jules Bianchi crashed heavily after losing control in rain and poor visibility and died the following year from his injuries having never recovered from a coma.\n\nDrivers on Thursday backed changing the weekend timetable.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody wants to put anybody\u2019s life in danger,\u201d said Ferrari\u2019s four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel.\n\n\u201cThe decision is not for us, necessarily, because for us it\u2019s nice and easy, cosy, in the garage.\n\n\u201cBut for the people out there around the track, it is not nice to be sitting there with rain going sideways.\u201d A blank Saturday would be a huge disappointment to thousands of fanatical supporters at one of the best-attended races on the circuit, but other drivers were prepared for the worst.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got my speedboat on standby, so I\u2019m ready,\u201d joked Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen.\n\n\u201cAt the moment it doesn\u2019t look very likely. So we\u2019ll have a bit more free time on Saturday and it means waking up a little bit earlier on Sunday,\u201d he added.\n\nFerrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc said he hoped the FIA would consult the drivers to decide if conditions were safe but thought it \u201cwould be pretty clear if we can\u2019t drive\u201d.", "description": "Japanese Grand Prix organisers will decide on Friday if the race weekend timetable, including Saturday qualifying, can go ahead as Super Typhoon Hagibis threatens the Suzuka circuit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c7ab670cbb34bdf28734d2feb2d00dd9?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
