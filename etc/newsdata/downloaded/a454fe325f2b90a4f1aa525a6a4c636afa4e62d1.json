The episode will refer children to free online bilingual resources.\n\nThe segment will feature Salia Woodbury, a 10-year-old California girl whose parents have been in recovery for eight years.\n\nIn the segment, viewed over the summer by The Associated Press in Manhattan, Karli and Salia drew pictures of flowers with petals representing feelings such as anger and happiness.\n\n\u2018SESAME STREET\u2019 CONFIRMS BERT AND ERNIE\u2019S SEXUAL ORIENTATION AFTER FORMER WRITER\u2019S COMMENTS\n\n\"Hi, it's me, Karli. I'm here with my friend Salia. Both of our parents have had the same problem -- addiction,\" Karli said.\n\n\"My mom and dad told me that addiction is a sickness,\" Salia said.\n\n\"Yeah, a sickness that makes people feel like they have to take drugs or drink alcohol to feel OK,\" the Muppet said. \"My mom was having a hard time with addiction and I felt like my family was the only one going through it. But now I've met so many other kids like us. It makes me feel like we're not alone.\"\n\n\"Right, we're not alone,\" Salia responded. \"And it's OK to open up to people about our feelings.\"\n\nIn another segment, Karli told Elmo how she used to feel like her mother's addiction was her fault.\n\nShow creators wanted to address addiction because there are 5.7 million children under the age of 7 who live in households with a parent battling substance abuse, they said.\n\n\"There's nothing else out there that addresses substance abuse for young, young kids from their perspective,\" said Kama Einhorn, a senior content manager with Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit organization that produces several educational children's programs.\n\n\"[If] even a parent at their most vulnerable -- at the worst of their struggle -- can take one thing away when they watch it with their kids, then that serves the purpose,\" she said.\n\nSalia's parents, Sam and Jaana Woodbury, are raising four girls in Orange County, Calif. They said they welcomed the show taking on the topic of addiction.\n\n\u201cWhen I was going through addiction, I felt extremely alone and isolated. I didn\u2019t have any connection to the outside world,\u201d Jaana Woodbury said. \u201cI think it\u2019s amazing that \u2018Sesame Street\u2019 is using their platform to share resources to help other women and fathers.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Sesame Street,\" which first aired in 1969, is no stranger to presenting tough topics to their young audience.
