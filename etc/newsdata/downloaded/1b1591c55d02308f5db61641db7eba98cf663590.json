(AP) - Carolina\u2019s win over the New York Islanders showed the Hurricanes they have a team worthy of the best start in franchise history.\n\nDougie Hamilton and Andrei Svechnikov each had a goal and an assist as the Hurricanes improved to 5-0-0 for the first time with a 5-2 win over the Islanders on Friday night.\n\nCarolina outshot the Islanders 40-19.\n\nTeuvo Teravainen, Brett Pesce and Eric Haula also scored, and Nino Neiderreiter added a pair of assists for the Hurricanes, whose previous best start was 4-0-0 in 1995-96. Peter Mrazek stopped 17 of 19 shots in goal.\n\nAfter winning in overtime in their first three games, the Hurricanes outscored Florida and the Islanders 11-5 in the last two games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cEvery game has that playoff feel a little bit. It\u2019s just fun.\u201d\n\nBrock Nelson had a goal and an assist, Johnny Boychuk scored and Jordan Eberle added two assists for the Islanders, who fell to 1-3-0. New York managed just two shots on goal in the third period against Carolina\u2019s relentless pressure.\n\n\u201cTheir speed gives everybody trouble,\u201d Islanders coach Barry Trotz said of the Hurricanes. \u201cThey\u2019re all about pressure, and their (defense) get up on it, and pressure, pressure, pressure.\u201d\n\nNo defenseman gets into the play on offense for the Hurricanes more than Hamilton, who assisted on Teravainen\u2019s game-opening goal just under four minutes in. He has three goals and four assists on the season.\n\nLater, Hamilton gave Carolina its first two-goal lead at 4-2, scoring on a shot from the point past Thomas Greiss in the final minute of the second period.\n\nHaula had broken a 2-2 tie earlier in the period when he forced his way to the front of the net and lifted his own rebound past Greiss. Haula, who has four goals, is off to a fast start after being acquired in June from Las Vegas for forward Nicolas Roy and a conditional fifth-round selection in the 2021 draft.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having fun with each other,\u201d Haula said. \u201cWe\u2019re going out there every night and throwing what we\u2019ve got at the other team, and that\u2019s good. It\u2019s good stuff. We have a good team and we\u2019re hard to play against.\u201d\n\nThe Islanders last faced Carolina in the second round of the playoffs in May. The Hurricanes swept New York in the series. The Islanders started Vezina Trophy finalist Robin Lehner in each game of that series, despite the 6-1 record Greiss had in his most recent seven starts against the Hurricanes.\n\nGreiss got the start Friday and finished with 35 saves on 39 shots as the crowd taunted the Islanders with chants of \u201cSweep, Sweep.\u201d Despite the identical score, Trotz said the effort was better than the Islanders gave in a 5-2 loss to Edmonton earlier in the week.\n\n\u201cMuch better than the other game, no question,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cI thought our compete level was much higher and more focused, and we\u2019re playing a really good hockey team right now that\u2019s on.\u201d\n\nThe Hurricanes were so effective that Carolina coach Rod Brind\u2019Amour said he couldn\u2019t find anything to complain about.\n\n\u201cI like the way the guys are coming to work every day,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 5-0, it\u2019s kind of irrelevant. We\u2019re trying to win the day, and that\u2019s the mentality the guys have had, and we have to continue. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to sell here, and so far they\u2019re buying into it.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Wing Anthony Beauvillier has at least one point in each of the Islanders\u2018 games this season and leads the team with three goals and five points. \u2026 In each of Carolina\u2019s five games, Teravainen has recorded at least one point. \u2026 Julien Gauthier, the Hurricanes\u2019 first-round pick in the 2016 draft (21st overall), made his NHL debut after being recalled from Charlotte of the American Hockey League.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Islanders: Home against Florida on Saturday.\n\nThe Hurricanes: Plays its second home game in as many nights, hosting Columbus on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Carolina's win over the New York Islanders showed the Hurricanes they have a team worthy of the best start in franchise history.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ken Tysiac"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/islanders_hurricanes_hockey_18524_c0-210-5051-3156_s1200x700.jpg?0eb3364f528b9b5f42a6027a1fd9479217bc99ce", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
