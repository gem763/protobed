But it has taken on greater political weight with GOP campaign operatives salivating at Democrats\u2019 first floor vote on a measure that touches on any aspect of impeachment.\n\nIn the meeting Wednesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi reiterated to her caucus that the measure was not a vote for impeachment. Still, she acknowledged it was a solemn moment for the caucus, and asked Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), a Methodist pastor, to lead the caucus in a prayer.\n\nRep. Jeff Van Drew has said that he is leaning against the resolution. | Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt was just ... taking a moment to say, \u2018This is a big deal for our democracy in the arc of our history,\u2019\u201d Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.) said as she left the meeting. \u201c\u2018Gather yourself, be ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaking this vote tomorrow is a very big deal,\u201d Kuster added.\n\nOnly five House Democrats have not come out in support of the impeachment inquiry. So far, just one vulnerable Democrat, Rep. Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.), has said that he is leaning against the resolution on the floor. And no one expressed concerns during Wednesday's meeting, according to multiple attendees.\n\n\"I\u2019m sure there are some, that wasn\u2019t expressed [today]. I think most of us recognize transparency and articulation of process is in the best interest of the country and for the institution,\" said Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who is one of several freshman who captured a previously GOP-held seat last fall.\n\nRep. Ben McAdams (D-Utah), one of the most endangered Democrats, said Wednesday he plans to support the measure and downplayed the significance of the vote.\n\n\u201cThis feels like just a formalization of the process we\u2019ve been in for some time now,\u201d McAdams said as he left the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfunctory vote to grant the authorization for those secure briefings to be made public to other members of Congress.\u201d\n\nSome vulnerable Democrats have privately worried that the Thursday floor vote could carry some risk because it marks the final vote before the House leaves for a weeklong recess, where they could face sharp questions back home about where Democrats stand on impeachment.\n\nPelosi and her top deputies have worked to equip Democrats with additional talking points as they depart Washington, including a fact sheet that compares the ongoing probe to past impeachments to rebut GOP criticism of an unfair process. And top Democrats have repeatedly stressed that Democrats are only moving ahead with their investigations \u2014 with no conclusion about the president\u2019s conduct.\n\nHouse investigators are continuing to question senior administration officials behind closed-doors about Trump\u2019s effort to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden, a top political rival in the 2020 election.\n\nTwo State Department officials were testifying Wednesday as part of the impeachment inquiry, revealing new details about the unusual intrusion into the U.S. foreign policy apparatus by Trump-aligned consultants.\n\nAccording to copies of their opening statements obtained by POLITICO, Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson described the unconventional efforts \u2014 which cut against the official U.S. policy toward Ukraine \u2014 in addition to Trump\u2019s \u201clong-held view of Ukraine as a corrupt country.\u201d\n\nAnd Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the first current White House official to testify, told lawmakers on Tuesday that he was so disturbed by Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he reported his concerns to the National Security Council\u2019s top lawyer. It was the second time Vindman reported concerns about efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden and his family.\n\nIn addition, Vindman told lawmakers that the White House transcript of the call omitted key details and his effort to add the missing words back into the memo were ignored. The New York Times first reported the omissions.\n\nNo specific timeline for shifting to the public portion of the impeachment investigation was outlined in Democrats\u2019 meeting, although several lawmakers have privately speculated that public hearing could start sometime before Thanksgiving, even if closed-door depositions are still ongoing.\n\nNo Republicans are expected to vote for the resolution on Thursday, with GOP leaders blasting the measure for not giving more power to the minority.\n\nStill, congressional Republicans have struggled to respond to the mounting pile of evidence \u2014 including Vindman\u2019s damning testimony on Tuesday \u2014 showing Trump sought to convince Ukrainian leaders to investigate his political rivals.\n\nTrump himself has encouraged Republicans to defend him more on substance, including in an early morning tweet on Wednesday. GOP lawmakers are still plotting ways to protest Democrats\u2019 process \u2014 including a meeting of the House Rules Committee on Wednesday afternoon to formally mark up the resolution.\n\nMultiple GOP lawmakers are expected to offer a parade of amendments in an attempt to slow down the markup, which Democrats are already dismissing as yet another stunt.\n\n\u201cThe Rules Committee is kind of a small room. But whatever, we\u2019re going to get through this and we\u2019re going to get our work done and this will be on the floor tomorrow,\u201d House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said.\n\nAndrew Desiderio contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/da/7b/3371b78f40b39e376d7db5f632cb/191030-hakeem-jeffriesap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
