Sevier Co\u2014we are better than this hate.'\n\nAnother user named Travis Akers claimed: 'Warren Hurst, the County Commissioner of Sevier County, Tennessee, calls Pete Buttigieg a \"queer\" and then later says \"white man\" has few rights. Warren Hurst is cancelled.'\n\nAnother named Derek Helling wrote: 'If you live in @SevierCounty Tennessee please contact your county officials to let them know this is unacceptable and Warren Hurst is unfit to serve, or you know, be a horrible person. Those are pretty much the only options.'\n\nA number of social media users called on Hurst to resign and called for people to reconsider visiting the area, which is a gateway to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\nKelley Garndener also claimed: 'He reflects you when he says them in your office.

Born in 1982, he would also be the first millennial president.", "description": "Tennessee politician Warren Hurst faced calls to resign after claiming that a 'queer' was running for President in apparent reference to 2020 Democratic hopeful Pete Buttigieg.", "authors": ["Leah Mcdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/19/20048566-0-image-a-67_1571768574728.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
