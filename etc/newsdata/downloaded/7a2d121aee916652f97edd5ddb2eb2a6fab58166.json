A first-of-a-kind study published Monday tries to establish whether Americans appreciate the offer.\n\nChristians generally value thoughts and prayers, the study found, but \u201cthis value is not universal,\u201d said Linda Thunstr\u00f6m, an economist at the University of Wyoming. \u201cThere are other people who are, if you will, harmed or experience discomfort from receiving these gestures.\u201d Atheists and agnostics would pay money to avoid having a stranger pray for them and were indifferent to a stranger\u2019s thoughts, the researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\u201cIf you wanted to maximize welfare for society,\" Thunstr\u00f6m said, consider the audience before giving thoughts and prayers as a response to grief.\n\nTwitter \u2014 where many give and embrace thoughts and prayers, and others swat down the offers \u2014 inspired the study. President Trump has tweeted \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d more than 30 times since he took office. A frequent criticism, particularly in the wake of mass shootings, is that the gesture is hollow and performative.\n\nThe phrase dates to 17th-century religious manuals, University of Notre Dame professor Thomas Tweed, who studies American religions, told The Post in 2015. The words have become a \u201critual or ceremonial phrase\u201d offered at \u201cdifficult moments,\u201d Tweed said, \u201cbut translated into the new media of Twitter and the other social media, it takes on a widely disparate meaning.\u201d\n\nTwitter \u201cmay or may not be a representative kind of medium,\u201d said study author Shiri Noy, a sociologist at Denison University in Ohio, \u201cwhich is why we set out to look at it empirically.\u201d\n\nThunstr\u00f6m and Noy studied people recovering from a natural disaster. They enlisted more than 400 North Carolinians in the fall of 2018, after Hurricane Florence struck. They studied two groups \u2014 Christians, and atheists or agnostics \u2014 because the two are \u201cthe most, perhaps, predominant in contemporary U.S.,\u201d Thunstr\u00f6m said. A majority of Americans, about 70 percent, are Christians. Twenty percent are nonreligious, and atheists and agnostics represent a fast-growing group.\n\nAt the beginning of the experiment, the researchers asked participants to describe hardships they had suffered within the previous year. Then the researchers introduced the offer of a thought or prayer given by a stranger.\n\nMost people cannot stroll into their corner stores and purchase a thought or prayer \u2014 a prayer, in an economist\u2019s jargon, is a \u201cnonmarket good,\u201d Thunstr\u00f6m said. So the researchers presented participants with a choice: a prayer or thought versus money.\n\nThe scientists gave their subjects a participation fee to compensate them for their time, plus $5 to use in the experiment. Participants could use all or part of that sum in exchange for a gesture \u2014 or to avoid receiving one. In every case, real money was on the line.\n\nLet\u2019s say Thunstr\u00f6m offered you a prayer from a Christian stranger or $5 to help overcome a hardship. If you declined the prayer, she would ask whether you wanted a prayer or $4.50. Now you take the prayer. If you were not willing to forgo $5 but you were willing to forgo $4.50, \u201cthat means your willingness to pay, or your value of the prayer, must be somewhere between $4.50 and $5,\u201d Thunstr\u00f6m said. Economists have previously used this technique to place values on things like nature or endangered species.\n\nIn some cases, the participants were told the prayer would come from a priest instead of a Christian stranger. True to what Thunstr\u00f6m called a tradition of \u201cnon-deception\u201d among economists, the study authors either gave the participants the money in question or recruited Christian strangers \u2014 and a priest, who volunteered \u2014 to pray for the people who chose the prayers.\n\nWhat kind of harm the participants suffered, whether hurricane-caused or not, did not influence how much people valued thoughts and prayers. Religious belief, though, showed a striking effect.\n\nThe Christians who participated in this study valued prayer from a stranger, on average, at more than $4. A prayer from a priest was worth about $7. The nonreligious participants would pay less than $2 for a priest to not pray for them, and over $3.50 to avoid a Christian stranger\u2019s prayer.\n\n\u201cThis article raises an interesting point \u2014 some people, maybe, just don\u2019t want your thoughts or prayers,\u201d said University of Colorado at Denver psychologist Kevin Masters, who was not a member of the research team. In 2006, Masters and his colleagues analyzed the body of research on the effects of prayer on someone\u2019s behalf. No study was able to show that prayer has discernible health benefits on a distant recipient.\n\nThe new research, Masters said, may reflect a difference in perceptions of prayer\u2019s meaningfulness. Christians may associate prayer with the type of empathy that encourages aiding disaster victims, he said, whereas atheists or agnostics may not.\n\nThe president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, R. Albert Mohler Jr., defended expressions of thoughts and prayers as part of the \u201ccommon spiritual language of the American people\u201d in a 2017 op-ed for The Post. \u201cPraying is not a way of avoiding responsibility,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut of affirming it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether people would respond similarly to \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d after mass shootings or other types of disasters, Thunstr\u00f6m said she \u201cwouldn\u2019t care to speculate about that.\u201d Thoughts or prayers from celebrities or politicians may provoke different reactions than a stranger\u2019s blessing, too. \u201cSomebody that you identify with, or whose identity you know, at least \u2014 that could all matter,\u201d Thunstr\u00f6m said.\n\nRead more:\n\nBirth order may not shape personality after all\n\nMisinformation is everywhere.
