I'd say 'it's a labradoodle!''\n\nFrom there, Conron said he received interest from breeders and other hobbyists who quickly latched onto the dog's characteristic coat and temperament and began to create versions of their own.\n\nThe labradoodle creator says he regrets ever unleashing the breed into the world after its popularity led to over-breeding (Stock photo)\n\n'I realized the reason for these unethical, ruthless people [was] to breed these dogs and sell them for big bucks,' Conron told ABC, adding that his intention was always to breed the healthiest dogs.\n\n'I opened a Pandora's box and released a Frankenstein's monster... When I'm out and I see these labradoodles I can't help myself, I go over them in my mind.'\n\nPopularity and loose adherence to breeding practices have worked to undermine the breed's health, he says.\n\n'I find that the biggest majority are either crazy or have a hereditary problem. I do see some damn nice labradoodles but they're few and far between,' Cronon told ABC.\n\nDespite Conron's regrets, the labradoodle eventually went on to be used successfully as service dogs notes ABC, had given rise to several offshoots, including the golden doodle (a golden retriever and poodle) and the jackapoo (a Jack Russell terrier and a poodle).", "description": "According to Wally Conron, an Australia native who was the first person to breed the labradoodle\u00a0 - a cross between a poodle and a labrador -  the dog opened up a 'Pandora's Box.'", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/00/18891910-0-image-a-15_1569366103505.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
