While smart technology isn\u2019t the norm \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 more apartment owners in the mainstream market are leaning into this trend.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTransportation, roommate preferences and even dining habits may factor into your housing decision. For those who don\u2019t want the added expense of a car, more communities in urban areas are exchanging parking space for living space. A micro-apartment may be a good fit for individuals who want a break from living with a roommate and who are willing to give up a little square footage. There are also rowhouse and townhouse options, where you can split the cost with several roommates but still have a space of your own.\n\nFor the young professional\n\nAccording to a 2015 Pew Research study, today\u2019s young professionals are the most well-educated generation yet \u2014 but this comes at a steep price.\n\nAD\n\nStill burdened by student loans, millennials make up a significant segment of the apartment market. Even as they progress in their careers and their debt becomes more manageable, many are still opting to live in apartments. Known for job- and city-hopping, millennials tend to enjoy the freedom that renting offers. Between a continued education, social and political causes, travel, and an affinity for unique cultural experiences, today\u2019s young professionals spend less time at home, drawing them to the easy convenience of maintenance-free living, pet concierge services and more.\n\nAD\n\nAre you a minimalist with a travel itch? Get the basic necessities with a micro-apartment and free up more money for travel, experiences and charitable giving. Co-living is also an increasingly popular option. It provides a little more space \u2014 albeit, shared space \u2014 while still keeping expenses relatively low. The standard five-floor city walk-up also caters to this group, and today an expanding menu of amenities tailors the experience to the individual\u2019s unique needs with custom community apps, bike storage and tools, electric charging stations, ride-share pick-up/drop-off posts, wellness classes, and more.\n\nFor the family\n\nFor the growing family with kids \u2014 and maybe even a pet or two \u2014 there are several options. Looking for a space with all the amenities and a sense of community? You may want to consider a multi-bedroom unit, offering a suburban feel with the convenience of apartment living. With this model, you have a pool for the kids, an easy-access exercise room to fit in a workout and maintenance-free living. This could be convenient when you\u2019re juggling soccer practice, ballet recitals and parent-teacher conferences and may not have time or desire to mow the lawn or to replace a broken water heater.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWant more bedrooms, living space and a yard, but with the flexibility to move as needed for schools and jobs? Consider a single-family rental and avoid being tied down with a mortgage. Already have a home, but trying to balance a long commute and overnights in the city? Short-term rentals require minimal commitment and provide an extra level of flexibility for the professional spending weeknights near work and weekends at home.\n\nFor the empty-nester\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to downsize \u2014 or perhaps more appropriately, right-size \u2014 ask yourself: What\u2019s my vision for this stage of life? For years, you have had many factors to consider: kids, school systems, jobs, etc. As you head into retirement, take a step back and reflect.\n\nAD\n\nDo you want to minimize upkeep and maintenance while putting away more money for travel? A traditional-style one-bedroom may be the best fit. Interested in splitting time between different locations based on the weather and where the kids or grandkids may be? Try a short-term rental until you\u2019ve settled on a more permanent rhythm. Ready to live the comfortable life with myriad wellness, social and cultural options at your fingertips? There\u2019s a plethora of options available from communities with state-of-the-art fitness centers, yoga classes, in-house chefs, vegetable gardens, group parties and activities, concerts, film screenings and more. You may also want to consider a mixed-use community with shops and restaurants right downstairs.\n\nWhatever lifestyle or preferences you identify with, commit to finding your true fit. Your home is a significant part of who you are. To live your most authentic, successful life, it\u2019s important that your home reflects and supports your unique values and needs.\n\nRobert Pinnegar is president and CEO of the National Apartment Association, headquartered in Arlington, Va.\n\nAD", "description": "Renters these days have many options, including traditional apartment buildings, newer micro-units and single-family houses.", "authors": ["Robert Pinnegar"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NFwkFVaksqGS3v-Pf2frunh11tE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JDRJMNUACMI6NDIM7NWABSIEQE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
