Victoria Wharf Shopping Centre was recently named as the greenest shopping centre in the country, some of its environmental features include; the use of grey water, low potable water consumption.\n\nThe renovations include adding a third lower level and a parking entrance to its now 88,647 m2 complex that houses over 450 retail outlets, 80 eateries, 5 undercover parking garages and 4 open parking areas.\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nNew retailers are expected to move in soon including the likes of Absolute Pets. Tenants will be expected to comply with the shopping centre\u2019s Green Lease that tracks a tenant\u2019s energy and water consumption, and also incentivises recycling.\n\nA second phase, still under construction, is to extend Woolworths over three levels. The new lower level floor will feature their food section which will be more than double the amount of floor space previously dedicated to it. Internal fittings are expected to be complete by November, just in time for Christmas season.\n\nThe V&A spent R17 million building an on-site waste treatment facility, which started operating in January 2018. The complex cleans up some 2.2 tons of discarded coffee cups a month alone.\n\nThis is what it looks like:\n\nThe refurbished wing adjoins The Table Bay Hotel and Woolworths.\n\nIt now has 3 open balcony-style levels that wrap around and overlook an impressive ground floor promotional court.\n\nThe effect is a light and airy space enhanced by the natural light that flows in through the atrium roof.\n\nThe new atrium roof took eight months to construct.\n\nThe new retail area will offer parking on the lower level.\n\nThey are installing six new escalators and two new glass feature lifts will link the different floors and improve the pedestrian flow.\n\nTo fit the lifts and elevators the construction team had to remove 500 tons concrete \u2013 just over the weight of one Boeing 747.\n\nThe ivory coloured floor tiles with a star pattern were custom designed, with each tile weighing 100kg and requiring 405m of strapping just to cut the slabs.\n\nWoolworths's food section will be moving down to the lower level, doubling their floor space.\n\nThey've already installed waterless hand sanitiser stations in the bathroom.\n\nThe Victoria Wharf Shopping Centre was named as the greenest shopping centre in the country. Some of its environmental features include; the use of grey water, low potable water consumption. By the end of this year, the V&A said it doesn't want any plastic straws on its premises. It also wants to cut down on single-use plastic bags.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "After 10 months of renovations, the V&A Waterfront has opened its R180 million extension.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9372/44323f09965b40719304d0073e3a9f46.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
