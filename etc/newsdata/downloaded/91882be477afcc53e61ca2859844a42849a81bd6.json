The lawyer claims Biden pressed for the dismissal of a top Ukrainian prosecutor who had been leading a corruption investigation into a gas company on whose board Biden\u2019s son Hunter had served.\n\nUkraine imbroglio confirms Giuliani's as Trump's most off-kilter advocate Read more\n\n25 April\n\nBiden launches his presidential campaign.\n\n1 May\n\nThe New York Times reports that Giuliani has been urging Ukraine to conduct a new investigation into the activities of Joe and Hunter Biden. \u201cGiuliani called Mr Trump excitedly to brief him on his findings,\u201d the paper says.\n\n10 May\n\nGiuliani cancels a trip to Ukraine. He had planned to travel to Kiev to put pressure on President-elect Volodymyr Zelensky to reopen investigations, in the hope of dredging up dirt on the Bidens. The lawyer described the aim of his aborted visit as \u201cmeddling in an investigation\u201d and admitted \u201csomebody could say it\u2019s improper\u201d.\n\n20 May\n\nZelensky assumes the Ukrainian presidency.\n\n25 July\n\nKey telephone call takes place, between Trump and Zelensky. The call now appears to be at the centre of the whistleblower complaint filed the following month.\n\n12 August\n\nWhistleblower complaint is filed by a member of the intelligence community, raising an \u201curgent concern\u201d relating to the president\u2019s actions.\n\n21 August\n\nGiuliani reveals that in August he travelled to Madrid to meet a top Ukrainian official, Andriy Yermak. He \u201cstrongly urged\u201d Yermak to reinvestigate the Bidens, among other matters. \u201cJust investigate the darn things,\u201d Giuliani says he told the official. The lawyer insists he is acting as a \u201cprivate citizen\u201d, though it later emerges the meeting was arranged with the help of Kurt Volker, US envoy to Ukraine.\n\n9 September\n\nLeading Democrats in Congress write to the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, requesting all documents relating to any effort by Trump to put pressure on the Ukrainian government to help with his re-election bid. The letter accuses Trump and Giuliani of acting \u201coutside legitimate law enforcement and diplomatic channels\u201d to harm Biden\u2019s campaign.\n\n13 September\n\nAdam Schiff, Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, subpoenas the Trump administration, demanding that the whistleblower complaint be handed over. Refusal to do so by the director of national intelligence, a Trump appointee, sparks an constitutional tug-of-war.\n\n18 September\n\nThe Washington Post reveals that the whistleblower complaint concerns Trump\u2019s \u201ccommunications with a foreign leader\u201d and a \u201cpromise\u201d that was regarded as \u201ctroubling\u201d.\n\n19 September\n\nGiuliani is interviewed by Chris Cuomo on CNN and in a heated exchange at first denies that he asked Ukraine to investigate Biden. About 30 seconds later, he reverses himself. \u201cOf course I did,\u201d he says.", "description": "A public claim by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer that the former vice-president had acted improperly set off a troubling chain of events", "authors": ["Ed Pilkington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04cc202793aaf8551452c9eda369d43ed5897b46/0_0_1398_839/master/1398.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=781be4c8e2ecb55c160eb4b1b11ba31b", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
