Mudd worked for seven NFL franchises from 1974 through 2012 before retiring.\n\nBut Reich said over the past week, Mudd started indicating he might be ready to leave the game again. He previously worked for the Colts from 1998 through 2009 where he helped teach Reich the nuances of run blocking and pass protection.\n\n\u201cHe was all in, it was tremendous in every way,\u201d Reich said. \u201cHe had a lot of energy, passion, a lot of knowledge and a lot of experience in those meetings. It was a lot of fun for our guys, especially our younger guys to get a chance to rub shoulders with Howard.\u201d\n\nMudd wasn\u2019t just a successful coach.\n\nHe spent seven years in the NFL as a player with the San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Bears. He was selected to three Pro Bowls, twice to the All-Pro team and won one Super Bowl ring - with Indy following the 2006 season. Mudd also was a member of the NFL\u2019s 1960s all-decade team.\n\nBut those played for the motorcycle enthusiast him and watched him drive around the field in faster than normal golf carts enjoyed learning from him.\n\n\u201cThey really harp on the fundamentals and do a great job teaching,\u201d All-Pro left guard Quenton Nelson said in May when asked about the two new line coaches. \u201cThey are very detail oriented and what they\u2019re teaching - I feel like I have already seen results in myself and my teammates too. So it has been awesome being coached by them and they\u2019re doing a great job.\u201d\n\nMudd\u2019s departure is the second surprise move in less than two weeks. Andrew Luck retired abruptly Aug. 24 following a preseason loss to the Bears.\n\n\u201cHe was really physically, I thought in great shape and his mind is still as sharp as ever. Man, that guy\u2019s mind is unbelievable,\u201d Reich said. \u201cI was able to kind of talk him out of retirement to come and help us make a transition. His contribution over the last six months has been tremendous.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Reich also said defensive end Jabaal Sheard (knee) and backup running back Jonathan Williams (ribs) would not play Sunday. \u2026 Backup defensive end Kemoko Turay is listed as questionable with a neck injury. \u2026 The Colts reached injury settlements with receiver Penny Hart and cornerback Shakial Taylor. The move allows them to sign with other teams.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Longtime assistant coach Howard Mudd has decided to walk away from football just two days before the Indianapolis Colts open the season at the Los Angeles Chargers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
