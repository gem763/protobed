He said the demonstrators have forced the government to approve a 2020 budget with no new taxes, as well as a raft of \"unprecedented\" reforms which included cutting in half the salaries of some current and former politicians, abolishing the Ministry of Information and other obsolete state institutions and reforming the listless state-run power sector.\n\nHowever, protesters were duly disappointed with the reforms announced by Prime Minister Saad Hariri and have continued taking to the streets to call for doing away with Lebanon's sectarian government.\n\nLebanon's power-sharing system based on 18 recognised religious groups dates back to French colonial rule, allocating posts for each of the country's communities and forming the basis of its major political parties.\n\nNasrallah warned that demands for a government resignation could cause a \"vacuum\".\n\nIn his first address since the crisis began, President Michel Aoun on Thursday suggested a government reshuffle was a possibility, an idea that was welcomed by Hariri.\n\nHezbollah, which is aligned with Iran, has been largely resistant to any move that would alter the current status quo. The group and its allies are part of the government that came to power last year after months of negotiations. Hariri is not aligned with the group and is therefore considered a shield against the United States sanctioning Lebanon.\n\nPro-Hezbollah groups and protesters clash\n\nShortly before Nasrallah spoke, groups of people chanting in solidarity with Hezbollah pushed into a peaceful demonstration at a square in central Beirut.\n\nThe men shouted \"we heed your call, Nasrallah,\" in reference to the Hezbollah leader.\n\nFollowing the scuffles, additional riot police with masks and batons were dispatched to the square to defuse the situation, which appeared to be growing more tense.\n\nAbsolute chaos as Hezbollah supporters attack peaceful protesters in downtown Beirut pic.twitter.com/IwvqVLUiEH \u2014 Timour Azhari (@timourazhari) October 25, 2019\n\nSome people began lobbing stones and sticks, threatening to quickly turn the so far peaceful protests violent.\n\n\"Nasrallah is more honourable than all of them,\" the supporters chanted about government leaders accused of corruption by the protesters. \"Riad Salameh is a thief,\" they shouted, in reference to the central bank governor.\n\nSimilar scuffles broke out on Thursday night at the same site in central Beirut.\n\nThe protests initially began in response to a proposed tax on Whatsapp calls. They are considered unique for both their geographic reach and support across sectarian lines.\n\nThe demonstrations have cut roadways, closed schools, and shut banks nationwide for days.\n\nHowever, numbers have declined since Sunday when hundreds of thousands took over Beirut and other cities in the largest demonstrations in years, but they could grow again over the weekend.", "description": "Hassan Nasrallah hails reforms won by protesters but says demands have been hijacked and calls supporters leave streets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/25/d41d4b3fa0ec4132b7daf0c46e606cff_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
