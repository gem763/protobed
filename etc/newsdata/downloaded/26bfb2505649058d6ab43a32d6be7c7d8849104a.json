Here\u2019s some simple tricks for seasonal well-being.\n\nScreen savers\n\nResearch shows that even looking at pictures of nature reduces mental fatigue and increases positive thinking.\n\nSwitch your phone lock screen and laptop screensaver image to your favourite nature photo, frame artwork from favourite beauty spots and buy yourself a nature-themed colouring book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust looking at a green scene decreases the stress-related hormones cortisol and adrenaline, which helps us to calm down.\n\nA nature-themed colouring book is a way to flood your mind with images of nature while engaging in the relaxing art of colouring\n\nFlower power\n\nFocusing on small details from the natural world enables our brains to switch off from work worries and think more creatively, so keep plants on your desk, treat yourself to a bunch of flowers for your bedside at weekends, hang air plants in your bathroom \u2013 these little nods to nature will boost general happiness and change our mental gears.\n\nBotanical baths\n\nA warm bath soothes muscles, induces comfort, relieves cold symptoms and helps us sleep better and adding woody essential oils to your tub for a true \u2018forest bath\u2019 boosts the medicinal benefits. Studies show valuable antibacterial, antifungal chemicals emitted by trees called phytoncides make their way into the bottle to help us feel our best.\n\nAromatherapy Associates new Forest Therapy Bath & Shower Oil blends 22 of nature\u2019s most healing ingredients \u2013 including Pink Pepper for respiratory health, Juniper Berry to cleanse the mind, Cypress to bring a sense of calm \u2013 for a bountiful phytoncide immersion, whatever the weather is playing at.\n\nForest therapy bath and shower oil brings the botanics of the woods into your bathroom. Even better if you\u2019ve got a plant on the side of your bath\n\nBlue sky thinking\n\nDaydream. Pay attention to the world outside your window. Look at the birds nesting, clouds floating, leaves falling. Mediate on how they move and change as you wait for the kettle to boil in the morning. Studies show a brain observing nature is more open to reflect, wander and be creative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnimal magic\n\nBecome a Doctor Doolittle. Autumn and winter is when birds really need human help, so invest in a bird feeder and good quality food to hang on your balcony or in your garden, investigating what is best for the birds in your area and your commitment level. Daily interactions with wildlife will remind you to feel awe and thankfulness that you are part of something bigger than yourself.\n\nCultivate calm\n\nFill your home with plants and cultivate cuttings yourself to deepen the effects of your horticultural therapy (Picture: atelierstellaceramics / Instagram)\n\nTurn your fingers green with some inside gardening. Horticultural therapy is real and even indoors in the colder months, the benefits of growing and nourishing plants from cuttings and creating new life inspires mindfulness and contentment. Spider plants and succulents can be grown from cuttings all year round \u2013 or make the most of the winter sun and turn a bright windowsill into an indoor herb or tomato garden.\n\nIf propagating plant babies is a step too far, invest in some houseplants with abundant foliage instead. Birds nest ferns and palms fill your space with green while Pinterest favourite Pilea peperomioides are full of personality and have lush green circular leaves that are so satisfying to look at.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBook worms\n\nReading words that evoke the long, balmy days of summer or a fresh spring meadow can help you feel less soggy and groggy as the rain continues to pour. If poetry is your thing you can\u2019t go wrong with William Wordsworth or Wendell Berry. If you like a longer read, powerful books about Mother Nature include A Honeybee Heart has Five Openings by Helen Jukes, Wild Sea by Joy McCann and The Lives of Bees by Thomas D. Seeley.\n\nBrush with nature\n\nUsing colours from nature in your home can create a home full of good vibes, so pick up a paint brush on a dreary afternoon. Blue is peaceful and perfect for areas of relaxation, green \u2013 the quintessential colour of nature \u2013 promotes feelings of health and harmony in community spaces, while lavender is calming and restful, perfect for the bedroom and a great night\u2019s sleep.\n\nSarah Ivens is the author of Forest Therapy: Seasonal Ways to Embrace Nature for a Happier You, Piatkus Books.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The days are getting shorter and the weather is damp and miserable\u2026 but Mother Nature can still do her magic if you invite her inside to hibernate with you.
