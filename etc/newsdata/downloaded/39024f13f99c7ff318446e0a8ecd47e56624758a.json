REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nCritics said the move demonstrated the unintended consequences of the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nSan Jose, California-based Adobe Inc, whose products like Photoshop and InDesign are widely used by designers, illustrators and digital marketers, said on Monday it was \u201cdeactivating all accounts in Venezuela\u201d to comply with the sanctions, which are part of Washington\u2019s effort to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nA slew of Venezuelan creative professionals took to social media to argue that Adobe\u2019s move would have a devastating impact on freelance designers and marketers, who are already struggling with a hyperinflationary economic collapse.\n\nGremiana Gonzalez, a graphic design student at the University of the Andes in western Merida state, offered instructions on Twitter on how to \u201ccrack any app in the Creative Cloud,\u201d referring to Adobe\u2019s collection of programs.\n\n\u201cIn a way it goes against my principles because I am not completely in agreement with piracy, but in these circumstances either you use pirated software or you don\u2019t eat,\u201d Gonzalez said in a text message. \u201cI know that just like me, many Venezuelans depend completely on freelancing, and Adobe\u2019s suite is the most widely-used, best-acclaimed and easiest to access.\u201d\n\nAdobe said its software will stop working in Venezuela on Oct 28.\n\nCritics of U.S. policy toward Venezuela pointed to Adobe\u2019s announcement as the latest example of how the Trump administration\u2019s steady escalation of sanctions has hurt ordinary people without succeeding in ousting Maduro, who is accused of corruption and human rights violations.\n\nWashington in January slapped sanctions on state oil company PDVSA, the lifeblood of Venezuela\u2019s economy, and has sanctioned dozens of top government officials.\n\nIn August, it froze all Venezuelan state assets in the United States and threatened sanctions on any company continuing to do business with the government. Adobe cited that measure in a statement announcing the decision on Monday.\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Treasury Department, which implements sanctions, said Treasury had \u201can active sanctions program in Venezuela aimed at depriving resources from the illegitimate Maduro regime.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman referred comment on a private company\u2019s individual compliance to Adobe. Adobe did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFrancisco Rodriguez, a prominent Venezuelan economist who has launched a nonprofit to help alleviate the OPEC nation\u2019s humanitarian crisis, circulated a petition requesting the U.S. Treasury Department to issue a license exempting software service providers from the sanctions.\n\n\u201cAdobe\u2019s decision to suspend services in Venezuela has revived the debate over the impact of sanctions,\u201d Rodriguez wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut maybe we are leaving aside the most relevant question: what can we due to mitigate the impact of these measures on Venezuelans?\u201d", "description": "Venezuelans desperately explored piracy workarounds on Tuesday to continue using Adobe programs after the software developer said it will cut access to its products for the country's users, citing U.S. sanctions.", "authors": ["Luc Cohen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438628683&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971GF", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
