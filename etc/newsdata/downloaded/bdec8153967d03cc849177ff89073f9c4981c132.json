(Fauzy Chaniago, AP, File)\n\nNavy divers have located the cockpit voice recorder of a Lion Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea in October, Indonesian officials said on Monday, in a possible boost to the accident investigation.\n\nRidwan Djamaluddin, a deputy maritime minister, told reporters that remains of some of the 189 people who died in the crash were also discovered at the seabed location.\n\n\"We got confirmation this morning from the National Transportation Safety Committee's chairman,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Indonesian navy's western fleet, Lieutenant Colonel Agung Nugroho, said divers using high-tech equipment found the voice recorder beneath 8m of seabed mud. The plane crashed in waters 30m deep.\n\nThe 2-month-old Boeing 737 MAX 8 jet plunged into the Java Sea just minutes after taking off from Jakarta on October 29, killing everyone on board.\n\nThe cockpit data recorder was recovered within days of the crash and showed that the jet's airspeed indicator had malfunctioned on its last four flights.\n\nIf the voice recorder is undamaged, it could provide valuable additional information to investigators.The Lion Air crash was the worst airline disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died on a Garuda flight near Medan.\n\nIn December 2014, an AirAsia flight from Surabaya to Singapore plunged into the sea, killing all 162 on board.\n\nLion Air is one of Indonesia's youngest airlines but has grown rapidly, flying to dozens of domestic and international destinations. It has been expanding aggressively in Southeast Asia, a fast-growing region of more than 600 million people.", "description": "An Indonesian official says the cockpit voice recorder of the Lion Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea in October has been found", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8242/b9f6422556ca489dbc2b3632bbd79222.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-14"}
