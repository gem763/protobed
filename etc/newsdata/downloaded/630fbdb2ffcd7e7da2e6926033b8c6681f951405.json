Tens of thousands of passengers have been affected.\n\nThe British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (BALPA) announced the three days of strikes would take place on September 9, 10, and 27 over a pay and working condition dispute with British Airways, the U.K.\u2019s largest airline. British Airways have told passengers not to come to the airport and have promised to help customers with refunds or by giving them the option to re-book their flights.\n\nDan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nBritish Airways normally operates up to 850 flights a day, a spokesperson told ABC News. They have cancelled almost all of them, including international flights into Great Britain from North America.\n\nThe airline decided to cancel incoming Sunday night flights from New York's JFK Airport, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Toronto, according to The Independent, because many passengers were due to take onward flights and the airline doesn't have the space to accommodate all their grounded planes in the U.K. JFK is currently hosting 15 planes, The Independent reports.\n\nOnly 10 flights are listed as departing from Heathrow Terminal 5 today due to the BA pilots' strike. pic.twitter.com/Fb33ZWJQfR \u2014 Simon Jones (@SimonJonesNews) September 9, 2019\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, with no detail from BALPA on which pilots would strike, we had no way of predicting how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly, so we had no option but to cancel nearly 100 per cent our flights,\u201d a British Airways spokesperson told ABC News via email.\n\nThe union, which represents 85% of all commercial pilots flying in the U.K., made the announcement in late August. In a press release they said that the strike was called \u201cas a last resort and with enormous frustration at the way the business is now being run.\u201d\n\nBoth sides have repeatedly stated their willingness to come to the table, but the fact that they have failed to come to an agreement shows the intractable and bitter nature of the dispute.\n\nThe two sides have been in negotiations over pay and working conditions for the past year. In early July this year, the union voted 93% in favor of industrial action. In late July, British Airways lost an attempt to seek a court injunction to prevent the union striking.\n\n\u201cWe understand the frustration and disruption BALPA's strike action has caused our customers,\u201d said the British Airways spokesperson. \u201cAfter many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this.\u201d\n\nThe union issued a statement saying that their \u201cargument is with the company\u2019s highly paid management and not with passengers.\u201d\n\nThe BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said that pilots had \u201cpreviously taken big pay cuts to help the company through hard times. Now BA is making billions of pounds of profit, its pilots have made a fair, reasonable and affordable claim for pay and benefits.\u201d\n\nMatt Dunham/AP\n\nIn 2009, British Airways pilots agreed to a 2.6% pay cut and a reduction of 20% to certain allowances after the airline said they were in a \u201cfight for survival\u201d following the financial crisis and subsequent economic recession, the BBC reported at the time. They received shares in the airline. British Airlines have said that the union rejected their deal of 11.5 per cent salary increase over three years which they deemed very fair.\n\nFor their part, the representatives for airline workers wrote in late 2018 that \u201cBritish Airways has allowed a culture to develop in which employees are disconnected from the airline\u2019s success.\u201d According to them, \u201cthe airline has moved from a \u00a3230m operating loss in 2009 to a \u00a31.8bn profit in 2017, with an even better result forecast for 2018.\u201d\n\nA day of strike action will cost British Airways around \u00a340m the union said in a statement. \u201cThree days will cost in the region of \u00a3120m. The gap between BA\u2019s position and BALPA\u2019s position is about \u00a35m.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, British Airways employed about 3,900 pilots, carries 145,000 customers every day, and served those customers 25 million cups of tea, the latest figures available. The company celebrated its 100th anniversary on August 25 this year.", "description": "Britain\u2019s airports were eerily quiet this morning as the first day of a British Airways pilot strike began -- the first for the company in its 100 years of operation.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/british-airways-strike1gty-ml-190909_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
