Lots and lots of them.\n\nYellen is the CEO of Belfor Holdings, Inc., a billion-dollar disaster relief and property restoration company. And since 1985, long before Yellen was chief executive, he has written a birthday card to every employee of the company every single year.\n\nToday, as CEO, he says he handwrites 7,400 cards annually \u2013 one for every employee.\n\n\u201cThere is an inside joke with acquisitions that I ask prior to closing: \u2018How many more people?'\u201d he told Business Insider \u2013 meaning, How many more birthday cards do I have to write? \u2013 \u201csince I am constantly calculating that in my mind rather than \u2018What is the EBITDA [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization]?'\u201d\n\nYellen started the practice 32 years ago. He says he started doing it after he was hired by his brother-in-law, since many of the current employees felt he was being given special treatment. If nothing else, the birthday cards would encourage people to stop by his desk to say thank you, he thought.\n\n\u201cAnd it worked,\u201d he said. \u201cIt got people talking, we started to communicate more, and I like to think it helped me earn respect within the company.\u201d\n\nFast forward to today, and Yellen is now bringing stacks of birthday cards with him on every plane trip he takes. But the practice isn\u2019t just for the thank you. Yellen has found taking the time to write out a card for each and every person has created a culture of compassion through the whole company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also something that doesn\u2019t have to cost a thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I learn of random acts of kindness being performed in the field, I take it upon myself to again, reach out in writing, and send a thank you card so that person can know they are appreciated and that their efforts don\u2019t go unnoticed.\u201d\n\nOften, Yellen said he\u2019ll try to include in the card a personal touch. He\u2019ll refer back to a memory he and the employee shared, or a conversation they had. He can\u2019t craft the most heartfelt message for everyone, he said, but he\u2019s been doing it so long, people have come to expect a card regardless of their rapport with Yellen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s woven into our company culture,\u201d he said.\n\nOver time, the gesture has made for a more compassionate, gracious workplace, Yellen said. People feel appreciated and reciprocate those good feelings outward. Some managers have even taken up the habit themselves to write cards for their team members, clients, and loved ones.\n\nOther CEOs may consider the gesture frivolous or a waste of time, but Yellen is quick to disagree. He said his experience has taught him that the value keeps coming back in spades.\n\n\u201cWhen leaders forget about the human element, they\u2019re holding back their companies and limiting the success of others,\u201d he said. \u201cFocusing only on profit and forgetting that a company\u2019s most important asset is its people will ultimately stifle a company\u2019s growth.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - Belfor CEO Sheldon Yellen has been writing employees birthday cards since 1985.
