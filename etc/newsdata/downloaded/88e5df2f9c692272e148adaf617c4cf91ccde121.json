If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nIn my opinion, the best part about the weekend is all the free time you have to shop\u2014specifically online shopping. More time means that you can strategically shift through deals and find the best prices on the things you actually want. That's exactly what I did this morning, and I found incredible deals on robot vacuums, Apple Watches, smart scales, and more at Amazon. Not only have we tested these products, but we've price tracked them too, so we know they're a good deal.\n\n1. $54 off: Our favorite affordable robot vacuum\n\nClean your floors without cleaning out your wallet. (Photo: Eufy)\n\nWe all hate vacuuming, so why do we still do it every single day? Instead, get a robot vacuum to do your least favorite chore. Plus, you don't even have to spend too much to get a great one. Right now, you can get our favorite affordable robot vacuum for its lowest price with the on-page coupon and code eufyrobovac, and the discount is already applied to the model in white. We already love the Eufy RoboVac 11S for its great cleaning power and reasonable price, but the newer 11S Max has been fitted with stronger suction, so you can assure no crumb will be missed.\n\nGet the Eufy RoboVac 11S for $185.99 (Save $54) with the on-page coupon and code eufyrobovac\n\n2. Lowest price: One the best electric knives\n\nCarve you way through perfect slices. (Photo: Cuisinart)\n\nWhether you're carving the turkey for Thanksgiving or just want perfect slices of baguettes, you're going to want an electric knife. After testing a variety of electric knives, our tester really liked this one from Cuisinart. It was our runner up only because it was a bit noisier than our winner (but still not too loud) and still aced most of the tests. Right now, you can get it for its lowest price\u2014so you can be ahead of the game for the big food holidays.\n\nGet the Cuisinart Electric Knife for $30.44 (Save $4.53)\n\n3. Lowest price ever: The Apple Watch Series 4\n\nCoinciding with the release of the Series 5, the Series 4 Apple watch lowered to an insane low price. (Photo: Reviewed / Betsy Goldwasser)\n\nAfter the release of the Apple Watch Series 5, Apple decided to give a massive discount to their Series 4 watches\u2014a.k.a their lowest price ever on Amazon. If you're in the market to upgrade your Series 3, or perhaps simply want to join the legions of Apple Watch owners, this is the time to do so. The Apple Watch Series 4 is also the best smart watch that we've ever tested, so you'd be missing out not to score it at this low price.\n\n4. Under $25: The best personal blender for smoothies\n\nThe silkiest smoothies we've ever tasted. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nNot matter how cold it is outside, I still love starting my morning with a smoothie jam packed with fruits and superfoods. To blend it all up, I like to use a personal blender, so I can sip straight from the cup. After testing a variety of personal blenders, we found that the Magic Bullet was the best for smoothies because it consistently made the silkiest smoothies with the least work. Right now, you can get it for $6 off with the on-page coupon.\n\nGet the Magic Bullet Blender 11-Piece Set for $23.99 (Save $6) with on-page coupon\n\n5. $15 off: A smart scale to help reach your goals\n\nTrack your stats to stay on track. (Photo: Eufy)\n\nA scale is key if you're watching your weight or trying to shed a few pounds before your next vacation. A smart scale takes things a step further\u2014it tracks your data for you so all you have to do is step on in the mornings and watch your progress from your phone. Right now, this smart scale from Eufy is $15 off. Aside from the fact that it has its own app it also syncs with Fitbit, Apple Health, and Google Fit. It also claims to measure body fat, BMI, bone mass, muscle mass, and more, but I can't be certain how accurate that stuff really is, but with this sale, it's worth a shot.\n\nGet the Eufy Smart Scale P1 for $29.99 (Save $15)\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
