He has held meetings with Ukrainian officials in an attempt to push false allegations that the former vice-president Joe Biden compelled Ukraine to fire a prosecutor investigating his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nThere is no evidence Joe Biden or his son, Hunter, engaged in corruption in Ukraine.\n\nThe chairs of the three House committees noted that Giuliani has acknowledged his efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials on national TV.\n\n\u201cIn addition to this stark admission, you stated more recently that you are in possession of evidence in the form of text messages, phone records and other communications indicating that you were not acting alone and that other Trump administration officials may have been involved in this scheme,\u201d wrote the House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, the foreign affairs chairman, Eliot Engel, and the oversight chairman, Elijah Cummings.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The New York Times reported that Trump urged Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, to help the attorney general discredit the Russia investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller.

Our independent law enforcement agencies are ready to investigate any case in which the law was broken.\u201d\n\nFor his part Trump, with false claims and incendiary language, continued to lash out at both Schiff, widely seen as the public face of the impeachment inquiry, and the whistleblower, whose identity remains secret.\n\nTrump suggests House intelligence chair should face 'arrest for treason' \u2013 live news Read more\n\nThe president zeroed in on criticism that Schiff received for his opening statement at a hearing last week in which he parodied Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelenskiy.\n\nSchiff \u201cillegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people\u201d, Trump wrote. \u201cIt bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason?\u201d\n\nThe comment echoed Trump\u2019s comment during a 2016 debate with Hillary Clinton that if he was in charge, she would \u201cbe in jail\u201d. In addition, \u201cLock her up!\u201d became a common chant at his rallies.\n\nThere is no basis for accusing Schiff of treason, which is defined by the constitution as waging war against the US or providing material support to one of its declared enemies, and is punishable by death.\n\nShooting the messenger is a familiar Trump tactic. But this time his words and actions are spelled out in a rough transcript and the whistleblower complaint. As his responses to the threat of impeachment become increasingly wild and wayward, he is receiving unusual criticism from some Republicans and former administration officials.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump rewrote a quotation from Pastor Robert Jeffress, who told Fox News: \u201cIf the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d\n\nThe Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger tweeted: \u201cI have visited nations ravaged by civil war. I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee.

Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, confirmed on Monday that the Senate would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to take the matter up.\n\nSuch is Trump\u2019s grip over the Republican party and conservative media that conventional wisdom holds he would be acquitted by the Senate, maybe even receiving a political boost. But polls show growing public support for impeachment.\n\nSpeaking at the Brookings Institution in Washington on Monday, senior fellow Jon Hudak noted that Richard Nixon won re-election by a landslide in 1972 and had a job approval rating far higher than Trump\u2019s.\n\nHudak said: \u201cTo think on election day 1972 that Richard Nixon would be impeached and removed from office, which but for his resignation he would have been, to think that would have happened in less than two years, people would have laughed in your face.\n\n\u201cBut alas, the evidence was built, the tapes came out and movement happened within the Republican conference and the Senate. Granted, our politics is different now from what it was in 1974, but this idea that there is nothing that can come out that will move a Republican senator towards voting to convict the president I think is foolish.\u201d\n\nRelease of Trump-Putin transcripts needs Russian approval, Kremlin says Read more\n\nLawyers representing the whistleblower, whose identity remains secret, said they have \u201cserious concerns for our client\u2019s personal safety, as well as for others connected to this matter\u201d.\n\nDemocrats on the Senate judiciary committee have written to its chairman, Lindsey Graham, urging that witnesses be protected from intimidation. \u201cThis committee should not sit idly by as the president threatens potential witnesses, whose testimony may be crucial to congressional investigations into credible allegations against him,\u201d they said in a letter.", "description": "Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, a pivotal figure in Ukraine scandal, is ordered to hand over materials relevant to impeachment inquiries", "authors": ["David Smith", "Andrew Roth", "Laurence H Tribe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b63302dca7c8ac3669f11ced806ca8ef34442fd/0_69_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ed6a75b9e9dc06e748675f443e4a528", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
