Charley rushed her to A&E, where she had to assure doctors that she had not hurt her baby.\n\nWynter was given a series of blood tests, which revealed she had cellulitis, a skin infection that causes swelling.\n\nWhat is cellulitis? Cellulitis is a skin infection usually caused by a bacterial infection. The bacteria can infect the deeper layers of your skin if it\u2019s broken \u2013 for example, because of an insect bite or cut, or if it\u2019s cracked and dry. Sometimes the break in the skin is too small to notice. You cannot catch cellulitis from another person as it affects the deeper layers of the skin. It can make the skin look red, hot, and blistered as well as causing pain.\n\nDespite her daughter\u2019s diagnosis, Charley says she continues to receive disgusted looks from people who see Wynter\u2019s face and think that her parents have assaulted the child. .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharley, from Shifnal, Shropshire, said: \u2018When I looked at Wynter in the middle of the night I noticed that her face was swollen, but thought her twin brother may have accidentally hit her.\n\n\u2018I made her a bottle in case she was hungry and then she went back to bed, but in the morning I noticed her face was completely bruised.\n\n\u2018I text my auntie for advice, because I didn\u2019t know what to do, and then decided to take Wynter to A&E because I knew something wasn\u2019t right.\n\nCharley woke up to find Wynter\u2019s face was red and swollen (Picture: Caters News)\n\n\u2018I was crying to the doctors, telling them it was a bruise and not to talk to social services, but after some blood tests they told me it was cellulitis.\n\n\u2018She needed strong antibiotics and to have further blood work done a week later and thankfully within a week she had recovered.\n\n\u2018I felt so humiliated taking her into shops whilst she was recovering and tried to hide her as much as possible, but people kept on looking at us in disgust.\n\n\u2018I can only assume that because her infection made her look like she had a black eye, people thought me and my partner had given it to her \u2013 we were even getting disgusting looks in the A&E waiting room.\n\n\u2018We even cried because we felt so bad.\u2019\n\nCharley is speaking out to urge people not to judge too quickly (Picture: Caters News)\n\nCharley is speaking out to explain that conditions such as cellulitis can cause symptoms that appear concerning, and that strangers shouldn\u2019t assume the worst without asking questions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018A mother\u2019s instinct is always right and I strongly believe you know your baby more than anyone.\n\n\u2018If they aren\u2019t well or something is a little different then it\u2019s best checking it out \u2013 you\u2019re better safe than sorry.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a shame that we were so heavily judged when all that happened was my little girl being sick, but at least she got all the help she needed.\n\n\u2018Hopefully by sharing our story it will raise awareness for what cellulitis can look like and also stop people from judging before they know the full story.\u2019\n\nMORE: Someone\u2019s recreated the entire Friends Central Perk set out of Lego\n\nMORE: Woman completes 10k obstacle race with hi-tech \u2018pirate leg\u2019 after breaking her ankle\n\nMORE: How I Save: The 24-year-old blogger and consultant with \u00a375,000 saved\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Charley Finch is speaking out after her daughters skin condition made her receive dirty looks.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90261505_1571306512.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
