I spoke to a woman who said she lived next door. She said it was a lad and his dad.\n\n\"The lad was in a worse way, she said he had been shot in the back. She held a tea-towel on his back, and he was crying, saying he was going to die.\n\n\"The dad was in a better way, I think he had been hit in the arm.\"\n\nA local who knew the youngest victim said: \"He was a good kid, he was always very nice, but he just sort of drifted away from the other kids here.\n\n\"It's difficult for young lads in Skelmersdale, there's nothing round here for them.\n\n\"It's the forgotten town. We don't have a train station, there are no youth clubs or sports centres. It used to be a great place to live but knife crime has shot up in the last 10 years.\"\n\nChief Inspector Ian Jones, of Skelmersdale Police said: \"We\u2019re in the very early stages of an investigation and I would appeal to anyone who saw or heard anything or who has information which could assist to get in touch.\n\n\"I know that this will have caused a lot of fear in the local community but would like to reassure people that this incident was not directed at the general public and appears to be a targeted attack.\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\n\"This level of serious violence is completely unacceptable and we will do all we can to find those responsible.\"\n\nA Section 60 order, allowing officers to search people and vehicles without suspicion, is in place for the area.", "description": "Merseyside Police are investigating the triple shooting and no arrests have been made", "authors": ["Jonathan Humphries", "Image", "Liverpool Echo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586681.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Skem-shooting_06.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
