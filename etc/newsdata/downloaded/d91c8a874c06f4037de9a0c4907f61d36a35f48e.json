In the past few years, its non-oil exports have grown significantly and so has their trade with neighboring countries like Iraq and Afghanistan,\" Vaez said. \"Iran can also smuggle oil and generate some revenue.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTOUGH SANCTIONS\n\nWestern companies raced back to Iran's market and its oil income surged a year after a 2015 nuclear pact agreed with six major powers ended the sanctions regime imposed in 2012 over its disputed nuclear program.\n\nNew sanctions brought in after President Donald Trump withdrew from that agreement last May are the most painful ever imposed by Washington, targeting nearly all sectors of Iran's economy including how it finances its international trade.\n\nThe OPEC member's crude exports have been slashed by more than 80% since last year, against 2012 when exports plummeted to less than 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) from about 2.5 million bpd.\n\nAlthough food and medicine are exempt, lack of access to the global financial system has given rise to a humanitarian crisis with shortages of specialized medicine.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has forecast that Iran\u2019s economy will contract in 2019 by 3.6 percent because of dwindling oil revenues. The World Bank anticipates inflation jumping to 31.2 percent in 2019-20 from 23.8 percent in 2018-19 and 9.6 percent the year before that. Some economists believe inflation has actually topped 40 percent.\n\nIranian officials repeatedly contend that the country can weather the storm, but the reality on the ground is harsh.\n\nThe sharp devaluation of Iran's national currency and difficulty paying for urgent import needs have led to spikes in the prices of bread, rice and other staples.\n\n\"It is easy for officials to talk about resisting America's pressure. They don't have to be worried about the rent or increasing prices of goods,\" said Ali Kamali, a 63-year-old retired teacher in Tehran. \"Prices are going up every day.\"\n\nAn end to sanctions is not in sight anytime soon, with Trump saying on Tuesday that pressure will intensify on Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani will give a speech at a U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday that will likely determine whether Tehran will re-engage with the United States.\n\nTensions have been further raised by Sept. 14 attacks on U.S.-ally Saudi Arabia's oil sites that Washington, Riyadh and the European Union blame on Iran. Tehran denies involvement in the attacks, which were claimed by Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen.\n\n\"Iran doesn\u2019t have many other sources of income, beyond oil, so their economy is in a tailspin ... They do have considerable budgetary reserves ... to get them past the next few months, but the situation is not tenable,\" said Chuck Freilich, senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.\n\nFINANCE HAS DRIED UP\n\nThe financial sanctions have hit banks, institutions, individuals and front companies in several countries like Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.", "description": "Washington's policy of applying \"maximum pressure\" on Iran with wide-ranging sanctions has shredded the country's oil revenues, sent its economy into recession and devalued its national currency.
