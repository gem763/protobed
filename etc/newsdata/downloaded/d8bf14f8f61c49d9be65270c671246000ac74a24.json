Gavin Newsom (D) for \u201cmismanagement\u201d and \u201cgreed\u201d that he says led to preemptive blackouts in an effort to prevent more fires \u2015 are breaking down due to \u201cwoke\u201d policies and attention to fair hiring. Carlson acted as the chorus, saying \u201ctrue\u201d or chiming in further.\n\n\u201cPG&E strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cHere\u2019s the utility which doesn\u2019t really know anything about its own infrastructure, but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?\u201d\n\nRubin pinned the cause on \u201cprogressive ideology.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem right now is that everything, everything, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many Black firemen we have, or white this or Asian that \u2015 everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,\u201d Rubin said.\n\nRubin urged \u201clibertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t keep the lights on and you can\u2019t keep the place from burning down, you\u2019ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,\u201d Carlson replied. \u201cIt\u2019s falling apart. It\u2019s a disaster. It\u2019s not civilized anymore.\n\nWatch the clip, shared by Media Matters, above.", "description": "The Fox News host and commentator Dave Rubin tag-teamed with a ridiculous twist on the ongoing disaster.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db96aa02000000c35507343.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
