In 2017, Nevils came forward to the network claiming Lauer anally raped her in a hotel room while they were working at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, and that she was \u201ctoo drunk\u201d to consent. \u201cThe encounter was excruciatingly painful,\u201d Nevils told Farrow in the book. \u201cIt hurt so bad. I remember thinking, \u2018Is this normal?\u2019 She told me she stopped saying no, but wept silently into a pillow.\u201d Now, in a rare public statement since he was fired from Today two years ago, Lauer is denying Nevils\u2019s rape claim and insisting that her story is filled with \u201cfalse details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter.\u201d He also insists their relationship was \u201ccompletely\u201d consensual.\n\n\u201cToday, old stories are being recycled, titillating details are being added, and a dangerous and defamatory new allegation is being made. All are being spread as part of a promotional effort to sell a book. It\u2019s outrageous. It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense.\u201d Lauer said in his statement, per THR. \u201cThe story Brooke tells is filled with false details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter. Nothing could be further from the truth. There was absolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter. Brooke did not do or say anything to object. She certainly did not cry. She was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner. At no time did she behave in a way that made it appear she was incapable of consent. She seemed to know exactly what she wanted to do. The only concern she expressed was that someone might see her leaving my room.\u201d\n\nLauer continues to say that he and Nevils had many more sexual encounters after the Winter Olympics, and that, when their affair ended, they would politely interact with each other at public events when their paths crossed. \u201cBeing upset or having second thoughts,\u201d Lauer added, \u201cdoes not give anyone the right to make false accusations years later about an affair in which they fully and willingly participated \u2026 my silence was a mistake.\u201d Lauer, for what it\u2019s worth, is reportedly planning a television comeback.", "description": "Nearly two years after leaving NBC and \u201cToday,\u201d Matt Lauer has penned an open letter about the sexual-assault claims lodged against him by women at the network.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/09/09-matt-lauer-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
