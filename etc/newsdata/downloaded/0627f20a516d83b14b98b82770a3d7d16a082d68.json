The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max (which start at $999 and $1,099, respectively) feature a third rear camera for customers who want the \u201cmost sophisticated technology,\u201d explained Apple CEO Tim Cook during the presentation.\n\nRelated: Apple unveils new iPhones, $4.99 price for streaming services: Live blog\n\nBut the increasing number of round lenses on the back of the iPhone 11 series had many viewers comparing the smartphone to a stovetop.\n\nSteve Jobs must be turning in his grave after seeing this iPhone 11 with the cooktop feature #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/t42GN5jhDO \u2014 Greengo Dictionary (@greengodict) September 10, 2019\n\nStill others said the cluster of lenses resembled tarantula eyes, a Furby \u2014 and even a \u201csurprised Cindy Crawford.\u201d\n\nThis what the #iPhone11 looks like to me \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 still getting it tho! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/IlTgeD5hYy \u2014 SPECIALK \ud83d\uddef (@kburton_25) September 10, 2019\n\nthe back of the #iphone11 is giving me massive tarantula vibes \u2014 Sarah Nic Aonghusa (@saraahmcg) September 10, 2019\n\nI knew this new #iPhone11 reminded me of something pic.twitter.com/UaHmpH5366 \u2014 Tony Shepherd (@tonysheps) September 10, 2019\n\nDoes anyone else think the back of the iPhone 11 looks like a shocked Cindy Crawford? \ud83d\ude2e #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/jVm1TH64PO \u2014 Stephanie Guevara (@compilesandruns) September 10, 2019\n\nWorst of all, many claimed that the bundle of round lenses on the back of the phones was triggering their trypophobia, which is a fear or aversion of clusters of small holes or bumps, like the air bubbles in a chocolate bar, a honeycomb or the body of a strawberry.\n\nOut of courtesy for people with trypophobia I won't share the latest photo of the iPhone 11, but holy moses its creepy looking. \u2014 P.M.

Plenty of others like the iPhone\u2019s new looks \u2014 or they are so excited about the abilities of the new cameras (such as taking slow-motion selfies, or \u201cslofies,\u201d as Apple is selling them) that they don\u2019t care about the multiple lenses on the back.\n\nI cannot believe I'm going to pay $1500 for this ugly ass phone #AppleEvent \u2014 Christina Warren (@film_girl) September 10, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s called iPhone 11 and it is indeed ugly.
