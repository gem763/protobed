(Jenifer Norwell/CBC)\n\nThe artist describes most of her work as being \"not photo realistic portraits\" done in a renaissance-era style with a twist. She uses lots of expressionistic brush strokes and there are lots of eyeballs, she told Daybreak Kamloops host Shelley Joyce.\n\n\"When I thought about making my pieces I thought about glitches like in computers,\" said Turnquist.\n\nTurnquist's art is featured in the foyer of a downtown building in Kamloops, which has been transformed into a new open art space. (Jenifer Norwell/CBC)\n\n\"If you've ever had your computer glitch out there's multiple images on the screen. So I thought, because mental health is considered a glitch, I use the eyes to represent that.\"\n\n'Darker side'\n\nThroughout her career, Turnquist has focused on the \"darker side of life,\" she said.\n\nAs she developed her style as a student at the university in the southern Interior city, she began to focus on mental health.\n\n\"I've known people who have suffered from mental health and some of my own experiences,\" said Turnquist.\n\nTurnquist hopes people who struggle with mental health can relate to her paintings. (Jenifer Norwell/CBC)\n\nWhile many of her paintings are based on herself, she tries to make her work androgynous so that others can relate to what the person in the painting is feeling.\n\n\"I'd love for my art to reach other people who are dealing with... mental health and don't know how to show it,\" said Turnquist.\n\n\"They can look at my paintings like, 'Oh that's really what's going on.'\"", "description": "Behind a nondescript door in downtown Kamloops,\u00a0the foyer of an office building has been\u00a0transformed into a new open space art gallery.
