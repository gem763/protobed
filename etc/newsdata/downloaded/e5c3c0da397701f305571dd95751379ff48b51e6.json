But some in his party are already worried his gamble could backfire.\n\nJohnson has called for a new election \u2014 the third in less than five years \u2014 to break the Brexit deadlock that has paralyzed the country\u2019s politics since the 2016 EU referendum. His hope is that a strong showing in December will give him a new mandate to push through the withdrawal deal he reached with the EU.\n\nHis party has a healthy lead in the polls: the Tories have 36 percent support, while second-placed Labour has 25 percent. But analysts say his plans could be upset by a political landscape fundamentally changed by Brexit, in which smaller third parties are tipped to play a decisive role.\n\nBritish polling expert John Curtice told VICE News that third parties, like the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party (SNP), or the hardline Brexit Party, could secure a record number of as many as 100 MPs, making it difficult for the Conservatives or Labour to win an outright majority in the 650-seat Parliament.\n\nThis was likely to impact the Conservatives more than Labour, Curtice said, as Johnson\u2019s party would have fewer allies to form a government. That would put his Brexit plans in jeopardy, and set the stage for a second Brexit referendum.\n\n\u201cThis election is binary \u2013 either Boris gets an overall majority or something very close to it, or there\u2019s a hung parliament,\u201d said Curtice.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s any result either than Boris winning outright, it means we almost undoubtedly we move towards a second referendum. Even if Labour aren\u2019t the largest party, they\u2019ll be able to look to the Lib Dems and SNP to prop them up for long enough to hold a referendum.\u201d\n\nREAD: The Brexit saga is never going to end and there\u2019s nothing you (or Boris) can do about it\n\nAnalysts said the election would be decided by the major party that loses the fewest votes to minor parties. Conservative voters are likely to be picked off by the Brexit Party \u2014 and by the SNP in Scotland \u2014 while Labour voters will be lured away by the Lib Dems.\n\n\u201cIt is likely both parties will lose vote share and so their challenge is really to lose fewer votes than the other party,\u201d Paula Surridge, a political sociologist at the University of Bristol, told VICE News.\n\nAlready, figures within the Conservative party have expressed concerns that new elections could spell a repeat of the disaster of 2017, when former Prime Minister Theresa May called a snap election in a bid to shore up her mandate and push through Brexit. Her gamble backfired badly, costing the government its slim majority.\n\nOutgoing Conservative MP Rory Stewart, a former rival to Johnson for the party\u2019s leadership, told the Financial Times: \u201cIt will be a repeat of what happened in 2017.\u201d Other former Conservative ministers told the newspaper they feared the election would blow any chance of achieving Brexit.\n\nTo help strengthen his party\u2019s prospects, Johnson has moved to reinstate 10 of the 21 Conservative \u201crebel MPs\u201d he kicked out of the party last month for opposing his Brexit strategy. He\u2019ll allow them to stand as Conservative candidates in December.\n\nREAD: Brexit delays are fueling a dangerous rage among Britain\u2019s far-right\n\nBut the prospect of fresh elections \u2014 which only became possible after Labour dropped its opposition and voted in favour of them \u2014 has also sent a chill through the Labour Party.\n\nMany within the party were reportedly opposed to leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to finally back an early election, fearing the party could lose seats around the country.\n\n\u201cSheer madness to hold a General Election in December & on Boris Johnson\u2019s agenda!\u201d tweeted Labour MP Barry Sheerman, adding that a majority of senior Labour MPs were opposed to the vote.\n\nAnother Labour MP, Peter Kyle, publicly despaired of his party\u2019s inability to make inroads in the polls against Johnson.\n\n\"He is the most unpopular Prime Minister in history and still we're struggling to beat him,\u201d he told Sky News.\n\nREAD: Boris Johnson lied to the Queen to get Parliament suspended, court rules\n\nAnalysts say Labour\u2019s convoluted position on Brexit is unlikely to cut through with voters increasingly exhausted by years of wrangling over the issue. Labour says that if it wins the December election, it plans to negotiate a new deal with the EU, then have a referendum on whether to accept the new deal or remain in the EU. In other words, even a Labour victory would guarantee months, or maybe even years, of further rancor and uncertainty.\n\nCurtice said that despite the hurdle for the Conservatives, it was Labour who\u2019s facing the biggest challenge.\n\nThe difference this time is that the main threat to their vote is the Liberal Democrats, whose position on Brexit was much more clear-cut: Scrap it altogether. \u201cThe difference this time is the Liberal Democrats are serious competitors,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd, Curtice said, Labour has to contend with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s striking unpopularity.\n\n\u201cThe Labour Party is in trouble, they\u2019ve been in trouble for months. They\u2019re led by someone who is even more unpopular than he was 2 years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nCover: In this image taken from video British Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaking in the House of Commons, London, Tuesday Oct. 29, 2019.
