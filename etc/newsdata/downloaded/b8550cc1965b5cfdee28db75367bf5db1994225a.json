You were elected \u00adpresident of UEFA in 2016. Since then social media should have made it easy for you.\n\nThe cases were being served up on a plate for you with the rise of camera phones.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nThe evidence was widespread with more and more players, \u00adespecially in the last year or so, willing to stand up and be counted on the issue.\n\nStill, you continue to fail them.\n\nStill, you continue to stick your head in the sand and, on your watch, allow yet another generation of black footballers across Europe to go into football matches without protection from abuse on the basis of the colour of their skin.\n\nYour head is in the sand if you seriously believe fines of \u00a39,000 \u2013 the amount meted out to Italian club Atalanta for their fans\u2019 racist abuse of \u00adFiorentina star Dalbert \u2013 are \u00adworking.\n\nYou remain detached from reality if you believe the \u00a322,000 \u00adpunishment handed out to Russia last year, for their fans\u2019 racist \u00adchanting aimed at the black players of France, was sufficient.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIf you were the CEO of a \u00adcompany, you\u2019d be out of a job today, with the avalanche of players citing your failure to protect them a damning indictment of your \u00adability to fulfil your duty of care.\n\nWhere are the black decision-\u00admakers around you to at least give you an understanding of how to approach this issue?\n\nWhere in your \u00adstatement is the \u00admention of events at the Vasil Levski \u00adNational Stadium on Monday night?\n\nWhere is your acknowledgement of what the England squad went through in \u00adBulgaria?\n\nYou describe \u00adUEFA\u2019s sanctions as being \u201camong the \u00adtoughest in sport for clubs and \u00adassociations whose supporters are racist at our matches\u201d.\n\nReally?\n\n(Image: Sportimage)\n\nWhy, then, does your three-step protocol effectively allow thugs three chances to hurl their racist invective at black players as they did on Monday?\n\nWhy were the \u00adofficials unable to even execute the protocol properly, failing as they did to show leadership and take the players off the field after the second instance of abuse shortly \u00adbefore half time?\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nDo you really think the fans of Montenegro would have cried \u00adthemselves to sleep over one match played behind closed doors and a fine of just \u00a317,253 from your \u00adorganisation after their racist abuse of \u00adEngland\u2019s players in March?\n\nAdmit it, UEFA are weak on the issue. Weak on standing up to clubs (especially the big ones) and weak on standing up to countries.\n\nThe players should not be \u00addetermining the quality of their working conditions. The onus is on you to ensure they are safe. We know that racism remains a \u00adsocietal problem.\n\nOther institutions, however, still have stringent punishments that act as a deterrent and serve to \u00adensure employees can go to work without the fear of racist abuse.\n\nOn your watch, European \u00adfootball continues to blame \u00adeverybody but itself.\n\nWhen you call on the football family to wage war on racism, you are effectively calling on the sport to do your job for you. That is \u00adunacceptable.\n\nIf you cannot send out a stronger message from the top of the \u00adEuropean game, then you should step aside \u2013 just as the president of the Bulgaria Football Union, \u00adBorislav Mihaylov, has done \u2013 and allow someone else to do so.", "description": "England's players were racially abused by Bulgarian fans during their Euro 2020 qualifier, the latest in a string of racist attacks", "authors": ["Darren Lewis", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Sportimage"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20588008.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-A-Bulgaria-v-England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
