In an open letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Harris says that Trump has used Twitter to \u201ctarget, harass, and attempt to out\u201d the person who filed an explosive complaint about Trump pressuring Ukraine to dig up dirt on rival candidate Joe Biden.\n\nTrump has been tweeting angrily about the complaint for several days now. Harris cites multiple messages where he calls the whistleblower \u201ca spy\u201d as well as a tweet where he called to arrest Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who has helped lead the investigation into Trump\u2019s actions, for \u201cfraud and treason.\u201d Offline, Trump has arguably insinuated that the whistleblower should be executed for spying \u2014 something Harris says makes his tweets more threatening. \u201cThese tweets should be placed in the proper context,\u201d she writes.\n\nAround the same time, Trump quoted a Fox News claim that \u201cif the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office (which they will never be), it will cause a civil war-like fracture in this nation from which our country will never heal,\u201d which Harris also notes. \u201cThese tweets represent a clear intent to baselessly discredit the whistleblower and officials in our government who are following the proper channels to report allegations of presidential impropriety, all while making blatant threats that put people at risk and our democracy in danger,\u201d she writes.\n\nINBOX: Kamala Harris pens formal letter to Jack Dorsey asking him to kick Trump off Twitter, writing \"these are blatant threats. We need a civil society, not a civil war. pic.twitter.com/zbC4dKUyEu \u2014 Alex Thomas (@AlexThomasDC) October 2, 2019\n\nHarris also publicly highlighted another Trump tweet calling impeachment a \u201ccoup\u201d and discussed banning Trump from Twitter in a CNN interview.\n\nTwitter told The Verge that it has received the letter and plans to respond to Harris\u2019s concerns. However, it almost certainly won\u2019t suspend Trump\u2019s account. The platform allows politicians with a sufficient number of followers to break its rules, asserting that it\u2019s \u201cin the public interest\u201d for users to see the tweets. It reserves the right to flag particularly bad tweets, but it\u2019s never even reached that point with Trump, despite previous controversies. In 2017, it cited \u201cpublic interest\u201d to justify letting Trump threaten war against North Korea in a tweet, although it did later delete a Trump video that included copyrighted music from a Batman film.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how Twitter is generally policing veiled threats of civil war. The company told BuzzFeed that it wouldn\u2019t remove a tweet from a prominent militia group claiming that the idea of a \u201cfull-blown \u2018hot\u2019 civil war\u201d was \u201cincreasingly on people\u2019s tongue.\u201d Like its competitor Facebook, the social network is struggling to moderate threatening political language on its platform without being seen as taking an ideological stance \u2014 something Harris is attempting to highlight, if not necessarily change, with her letter.\n\nUpdate 9:25AM ET: Added statement from Twitter.", "description": "California senator and 2020 presidential candidate Kamala Harris has asked Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to suspend President Donald Trump\u2019s account after several days of dark tweets about impeachment.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F7wiPWacqvDJE83J_GIy1JFXcIQ=/0x0:4021x2105/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19252488/1171378350.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
