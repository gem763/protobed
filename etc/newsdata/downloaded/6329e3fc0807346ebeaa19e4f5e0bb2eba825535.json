In this week\u2019s debate, Warren denounced Trump for having \u201ccreated a bigger-than-ever humanitarian crisis.\u201d But earlier this month, the International Crisis Group warned that, if American troops unilaterally leave Afghanistan, \u201cAfghans could pay a heavy price\u201d as that country\u2019s war \u201cwould likely intensify and become more chaotic.\u201d A Rand Corporation report in January predicted that following a unilateral American withdrawal, \u201ccivilian deaths will spike, and refugee flows will increase significantly,\u201d and that \u201cthe major advances that Afghans have achieved in democracy, press freedom, human rights, women\u2019s emancipation, literacy, longevity, and living standards will be rolled back.\u201d In September, nine former American diplomats with experience in Afghanistan pleaded, \u201cA major withdrawal of US forces should follow, not come in advance of [a] real peace agreement,\u201d or else the United States might \u201cbetray all those who have believed our promises or stepped forward with our encouragement to promote democracy and human rights.\u201d\u2026\n\nThe parallels between Afghanistan and northern Syria aren\u2019t merely humanitarian. In condemning Trump\u2019s actions in Syria, Warren accused him of having \u201chelped ISIS get another foothold, a new lease on life.\u201d But experts forecast a similar terrorist resurgence if Warren carries out her proposed Afghan withdrawal. Following a unilateral American departure, the Rand report predicts, \u201cextremist groups, including Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, [will] gain additional scope to organize, recruit, and initiate terrorist attacks against U.S. regional and homeland targets.\u201d In their joint statement, the nine former American diplomats envision \u201can Afghan civil war in which the Islamic State (IS) presence could expand its already strong foothold\u201d and \u201cthe Taliban would maintain their alliance with al-Qaeda. All of this could prove catastrophic for US national security as it relates to our fight against both al-Qaeda and IS.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Peter Beinart", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Democrats-Want-Out-Afghanistan-So-Why-Not-Syria"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
