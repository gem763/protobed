The gathering I addressed yesterday, I can't tell you what a friendly, colourful, gentle gathering it was.\n\n'I don't think many of them are breaking the law. I don't as far as I know. I certainly wasn't breaking the law - I was in Trafalgar Square, in the licensed place.'\n\nSpeaking as the demonstrations entered their fourth day in London, Mr Johnson senior added: 'I believe that they are wedded to non-violence, to peaceful process.\n\n'The point I really want to make is they, and of course Greta Thunberg got it all going, the Extinction Rebellion isn't just in this country and many cities in this country.\n\n'It's around the world, and they're finally saying to themselves, 30 years to get a convention going, and we all know we're getting nowhere near what we need to do.'\n\nMr Johnson senior joins Extinction Rebellion protesters in London's Trafalgar Square yesterday\n\nMr Johnson senior, who is a former Conservative MEP and has written books on environmental issues, then insisted: 'They have to do it, they've got to do it.'\n\nHe was then asked by presenter Nick Robinson about his flying, and replied: 'I do fly, it's perfectly true. I do fly, there's no question about it.\n\n'No I won't stop flying because I justify my flying pretty often on the basis I'm going there to do some speech about the environmental problems or write about the animals. I spend a lot of time writing about wild animals in wild places.'\n\nHe also insisted that climate change is one thing that unites the family, including his Prime Minister son, despite their views over Brexit ranging wildly.\n\nMr Johnson met other protesters in London yesterday as he wore the XR logo on his jacket\n\n'If there's an issue that does unite us, I would say it's this environmental issue, climate change,' Mr Johnson senior added.\n\nIt comes after Mr Johnson yesterday rubbished his son's dismissal of the protestors who have brought London to a standstill as 'uncooperative crusties'.\n\nIn an embarrassing intervention for his son, Mr Johnson senior praised XR for doing 'exactly the right things' as its activists blocked off streets.\n\nMr Johnson senior, 79, said his entire family was 'united' against climate change, claiming that there is not a 'single dissenting voice'.\n\nMr Johnson senior yesterday rubbished his son's dismissal of the Extinction Rebellion activists\n\nIt came after the Prime Minister denounced its members as 'importunate nose-ringed climate change protestors' who smell of hemp at an event on Monday.\n\nBut his father said yesterday he had taken the categorisation by his son at an event to launch a volume of an official biography of Margaret Thatcher as a compliment.\n\nAppearing at a demonstration in Trafalgar Square with XR's logo on his jacket, Mr Johnson said: 'On the point of uncooperative crusties, I wear that badge with pride.\n\n'It's one of the nicest things anyone has ever said about me. Absolutely superb... I take it as a tremendous compliment.'\n\nMr Johnson senior spoke next to a poster in London yesterday mocking his son's comments\n\nThe PM's girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, 31, is a vocal campaigner on environmental issues and has appeared alongside Mr Johnson senior at an anti-whaling protest.\n\nMr Johnson senior insisted that his son 'really does get' concerns about the environment and had made the remarks 'in humour'.\n\nHe said: 'We are all getting so po-faced about after dinner speech. If you can't misspeak from time to time what is the point in anything.'\n\nThe PM appeared to row back from his criticism on Tuesday, claiming that he 'deplored the tactics' of XR while claiming that they 'are right to rebel'.\n\nMr Johnson senior congratulates his son Boris as he leaves the stage with his partner Carrie Symonds after his speech at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on October 2\n\nHis father, however, appeared to endorse the group's desire to wreak havoc in London and promised he would invite his son to meet its leaders.\n\nMr Johnson senior said: 'I think Extinction Rebellion are a fine bunch of people. I fully support them. You people have exactly the right thing in mind here. You can do it.'\n\nWhile ruling out acting illegally and risking arrest himself, he said the group's power rested in their commitment to protest peacefully while opposing any violence.\n\nHe added: 'Capitalism caused the problem, capitalism can jolly well sort it out.'", "description": "Boris Johnson's father Stanley was asked on BBC Radio 4 today if he supports the activists occupying streets in the capital and their plans to chain themselves to parts of London City Airport.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline", "Mario Ledwith For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/09/19528854-0-image-a-44_1570695248806.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
