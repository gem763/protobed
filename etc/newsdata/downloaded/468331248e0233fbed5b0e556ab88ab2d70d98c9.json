My lad William set up a league with his mates and I joined that but I didn\u2019t really know the rules,\" he told The Athletic .\n\n\"I was so far behind that I lost interest and gave up. But this time around 25 of us stuck a tenner in each so I decided to take it more seriously.\n\n\"I studied the rules and made sure I knew exactly what the deal was in terms of earning points.\n\n\"They were all taking the piss at the start saying \u2018old man, you haven\u2019t got a chance\u2019. They aren\u2019t taking the piss anymore!\u201d\n\nTanner made his Liverpool debut in December 1989 after being bought from Bristol Rovers for \u00a320,000.\n\nBut his playing career was cruelly cut short at the age of 28 due to a persistent back problem, with his final appearance coming in 1992.\n\nNow, Tanner is something of a Fantasy Football connoisseur.\n\n(Image: Nick Tanner/Twitter)\n\nHe claims that the secret to success is to spend money on expensive midfielders and strikers - and do not waste your money on those further back.\n\nUsing your bonuses early also helps to build an early lead, giving you points on the board to subsequently keep you interested.\n\nHe also claims that you should stay away from Manchester City players due to the extreme squad rotation system - despite having Raheem Sterling in his side.", "description": "Nick Tanner is remarkably the top Fantasy Football player in the world - and it's only his second year playing the game", "authors": ["Aaron Flanagan", "Image", "Getty Images", "Nick Tanner Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20542203.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Nick-Tanner.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
