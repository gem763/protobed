Temperatures may trend a touch warmer, with highs heading for the upper 60s to near 70 under mostly sunny skies. Confidence: High\n\nTomorrow night: Trouble-free weather continues as skies stay mostly clear. Temperatures cool off nicely again with lows in the 40s . Confidence: High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nHigh pressure should keep us partly sunny and dry during the day on Friday with highs in the mid-to-upper 60s. Can\u2019t rule out a shower Friday night (although at this point, we\u2019re not too worried about Game 3 of the World Series Friday evening) with lows in the upper 40s to low 50s. Confidence: Medium\n\nTough forecast for the weekend due to uncertainty in the track and timing of a system approaching from the west. We have to allow for at least a chance of showers by Saturday afternoon into Sunday with highs both days in the 60s. Rain chances should be down but not out by Sunday evening. (The forecast is just too iffy at this point to say anything with much confidence about Game 4 Saturday evening and a possible Game 5 Sunday evening, but you can trust we\u2019ll keep you posted).
