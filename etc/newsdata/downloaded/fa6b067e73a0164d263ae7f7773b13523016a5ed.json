I\u2019ve achieved most things that I\u2019ve wanted to this year,\u201d he said in Shanghai.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with where everything is, and yeah, just want to finish the year off strongly because I feel the year that I\u2019ve had deserves a finish like that.\u201d\n\nThe $10.25 million Shanghai event, with a winner\u2019s prize of $1.7 million, is the third and final leg of the PGA Tour\u2019s Asian swing, after the Zozo Championship and the CJ Cup in South Korea the week before.\n\nIn Japan, McIlroy led the field in par-five scoring, which should serve him well on the lengthy Sheshan course, widely considered one of the toughest on the Tour.\n\nAlso in the mix are a slew of past HSBC winners including Xander Schauffele, who beat current PGA Tour driving distance leader Tony Finau in an exciting play-off last year.\n\nRose, Watson, Garcia, Francesco Molinari and Mickelson also have tasted success in Shanghai.\n\nAnother to watch is 2016 winner Hideki Matsuyama, whose mojo is working after finishing second to Woods on home soil in Japan at the weekend, and third in Korea the week before.", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 World number two Rory McIlroy said his strongest season in years has motivated him to recapture golf\u2019s top ranking, as he", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/b39327_rory-mcilroy-is-gunning-return-world-number-one-motivated-mcilroy-headlines-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
