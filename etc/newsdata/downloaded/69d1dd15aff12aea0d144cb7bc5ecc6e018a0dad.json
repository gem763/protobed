Then defying the doctors who said they would never be able to walk and talk.\n\nAnd now, their biggest struggle of all \u2013 to find a forever home with a family who will love them and offer the chance of a happy, fulfilling life.\n\nThis National Adoption Week the three-year-olds are just two of over 4,000 children in England patiently waiting for families of their own.\n\nBut with twice as many children as adopters, the wait is proving longer for some than others.\n\n(Image: Rowan Griffiths)\n\nLike Charlotte and Jessica, who have special health needs and will need a family that can care for them both together.\n\nAt their foster home, with their cute red curls tied up in tiny pony tails and matching baby-pink glasses, it\u2019s hard to tell the sisters apart as they excitedly show off their growing vocabulary. \u201cBiscuit,\u201d being a universal language of all kids.\n\nCharlotte can get up and toddle around with her toy ice cream cart but Jessica isn\u2019t yet able to stand.\n\nNot that having cerebral palsy has ever stopped Jessica getting exactly what she wants, and the cheeky tot can use commando crawling to devastating effect.\n\nEmma Johnson, family finder for the girls, says: \u201cJessica is a very determined little girl. She gets to exactly where she needs to go \u2013 when least expected!\u201d\n\nThough they look identical, the sisters are chalk and cheese when it comes to food. Charlotte\u2019s a bit fussy but Jessica will happily eat anything put in front of her.\n\nOn paper the girls look like a catalogue of medical issues, yet they\u2019re full of fun and as bright as buttons.\n\n(Image: Rowan Griffiths)\n\nAffectionate and friendly, it\u2019s clear that although they\u2019ve had a difficult start to life the sisters have known nothing but love.\n\nThey also know just how to win over their warm-hearted foster carer Lesley, who has cared for them since they were born.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to fall in love with these two,\u201d smiles Lesley, who is usually cuddling one or the other.\n\nSuper-carer Lesley has been fostering for 32 years and has given more than 40 vulnerable children a much-needed loving start in life.\n\nAlso a single parent to her own 20-year-old adopted daughter, Lesley is one of the many un- sung heroes of the care world.\n\nBut now, at 64, she fears she is too old to offer the twins a permanent home.\n\n(Image: Rowan Griffiths)\n\nShe says: \u201cI worry that by the time they\u2019re teenagers I\u2019ll be in my 70s and I don\u2019t think it would be fair on them. Also, lifting Jessica will become more of a problem as the girls grow bigger.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know yet whether Jessica will walk, as Lesley explains: \u201cThe doctors have said that if she is able to sit up unaided by the time she\u2019s five, there is more hope she will be able to walk in the future.\u201d\n\nThe girls\u2019 six-monthly physio checks have so far been encouraging and not only can Jessica lift her head and move around, she also has good upper body strength.\n\nBut social worker Emma stresses: \u201cIt is important that any family thinking of committing to these girls knows their full medical histories.\u201d\n\nThere will be a great deal of extra help and funding in the future for the twins, as the extent of their global development delay and impaired vision becomes better known.\n\nBoth have had cataracts removed and it is possible that Charlotte could develop glaucoma.\n\n(Image: Google)\n\nBut they can see to look at people, read books and spot the all-important biscuit tin coming out.\n\nTaking on these twin treasures is not for the faint-hearted \u2013 but for the right family, the rewards of helping them achieve their full potential will far outweigh the hard work.\n\nAnyone over 21 can offer a child a home. They do not need to be married or in a relationship. And gay or lesbian adopters or people with disabilities are welcomed.", "description": "Twin girls Charlotte and Jessica have beat the odds with a tough start to life but now they are waiting for a forever home", "authors": ["Siobhan Mcnally", "Image", "Rowan Griffiths", "Google"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20642506.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RGP_MDM_151019twins_01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
