His wife is extremely wealthy, as wealthy as Hariri,\" Saad said.\n\n\n\n\"They criticise Hezbollah for not stopping corruption, because Berri is a main Hezbollah ally and Hezbollah has done nothing to hold him to account or to hold other partners in government to account.\"\n\nBut there is little Hezbollah can do to confront the government due to \"crucial\" alliances which are forged to preserve stability and security, Saad added.\n\n\n\nThe Shia duo Hezbollah and Amal, and its allies, emerged as the biggest winners in the election.\n\n\n\nHezbollah is a major political force, having won 13 seats in the May 2018 parliamentary elections and securing three cabinet posts.\n\nIt's been in an alliance with Maronite Christian ally President Michel Aoun, head of the Free Patriotic Movement for over a decade, helping him to win the presidency in 2016.\n\nPower vacuum\n\nHassan Nasrallah, leader of Hezbollah, backed the government and opposed its resignation in his televised addresses to the nation, most recently on Friday.\n\n\n\nOn October 19, Nasrallah said the protests were \"a waste of time\".\n\nSaad said it would take too long to agree on an electoral law for early elections, as the last time they came up with something in the last elections, it was much less than ideal.\n\n\n\n\"The ideal would be proportional representation in Lebanon as a single constituency. But Christians don\u2019t want it. They say it will marginalise them,\" Saad said.\n\nIn his second speech on Friday, Nasrallah warned that a government resignation would create a power vacuum which could lead the country into civil unrest, conjuring fears of Lebanon's 15-year civil war that came to an end in 1990.\n\n\"Lebanon has entered a stage of regional political targeting, and it is no longer just a popular movement,\" he said.\n\nForeign influences\n\nLina Khatib, head of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, viewed Nasrallah\u2019s speeches as an attempt at discrediting the protest movement.\n\n\"When statements like this are made, warning of political vacuum and chaos and civil war, they point out not at real expectations but more as discomfort on Hezbollah\u2019s part,\" Khatib said.\n\n\"It\u2019s beginning to feel threatened by protests on the streets because Hezbollah is part of the ruling elite in Lebanon and the protesters are not budging in terms of saying they are against everything in the political class in the country, including Hezbollah.\"\n\nFormed in 1982, following Israel's invasion of Lebanon, Hezbollah (Party of God in Arabic) is the only movement in Lebanon not to have disarmed after the 1975-90 civil war.\n\n\n\nThe Shia movement liberated South Lebanon from Israeli occupation in 2000, and also defended the country in a month-long war against Israel in 2006, a military success for the Iran-backed group fighting against a state army.\n\nBut in recent months there has been an increase in Israeli drones violating Lebanon's airspace. On Wednesday, a Lebanese man shot down an Israeli drone with a rifle near the border village of Kfar Kila.\n\nThe Shia movement liberated South Lebanon from Israeli occupation in 2000 [Ibrahim Amro/AFP]\n\nIn September, Hezbollah said it shot down an Israeli drone near the southern town of Ramyah, the first such incident since 2006.\n\nSaad believes there is \"genuine\" concern that a political and security vacuum can be exploited by the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel which would affect Hezbollah and its resistance.\n\n\"Hezbollah\u2019s resistance has always dictated its political choices. It has always subordinated its political gain for the resistance,\" Saad said.\n\n\n\n\"And that\u2019s why it\u2019s always made alliances with Amal [with whom it used to clash in the civil war], for example. In 2005, it joined this government. It never joined any government in the past because it knew people would hold it to account for its economic policies and they didn\u2019t want to be responsible for that. It\u2019s ironic because it\u2019s happening now.\"\n\n\n\nWhen a polarisation formed over Hezbollah\u2019s arms in 2005, the group joined the government to attain veto power over any strategic decision that would decide to disarm it, Saad noted.\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s always made choices to preserve its resistance. That\u2019s always been the priority,\" Saad said.\n\n\n\nThe Shia movement has come under increasing financial pressure as US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration ramped up its sanctions against the group to unprecedented levels, targeting lawmakers for the first time earlier this month as well as a local bank accused of having ties with Hezbollah.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, two US officials visited Beirut in September and warned sanctions will increase to deprive Hezbollah of its sources of income.\n\nIn March, Hezbollah asked its popular base for donations after the UK announced it would seek to ban Hezbollah\u2019s political wing as a \u2018terrorist organisation\u2019.\n\nIn areas where it dominates, Hezbollah has filled in for the government\u2019s inactivity by offering citizens a variety of public services, including in education and health.\n\n'Least tarnished'\n\nWhether the government resigns or not, Saad said Hezbollah would be the least affected by a change of political leaders as the group would probably win the same number of seats in early elections.\n\n\n\n\"They\u2019ve won more seats than ever in the elections. It\u2019s [the group] the least tarnished by these protests so I don\u2019t see any problem for Hezbollah,\"Saad said.\n\nHowever, Khatib believes Hezbollah has a lot to lose from the protests as it is Lebanon's most influential political party and [Nasrallah is] de facto ruler of the country.\n\n\"Hezbollah has the most to lose from the kind of political change demanded by the protesters which is calling for a civil state that is accountable and transparent,\" Khatib said, adding that the only way the political system can be \"shaken\" is if disagreements start to occur between different political parties in the ruling class about what to do next.\n\n\"For now, it is clear that the political elites are trying to get together on one side against the Lebanese protesters but it\u2019s not clear as to how long the show of unity will last,\" Khatib said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Hezbollah is a major political force, having won 13 seats in the May 2018 elections and securing three cabinet posts.", "authors": ["Mersiha Gadzo"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/27/bed26a5672c340e8a045eda89ff6d80a_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
