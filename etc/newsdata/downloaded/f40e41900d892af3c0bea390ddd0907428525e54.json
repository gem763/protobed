And as a way to keep people engaged with the cause, people and companies try to be as creative as they can, and often as cute as they can, in order to attract attention.\n\nBut at the same time, a lot of people feel that these efforts diminish the experience of having breast cancer, turning it into something cute, light, and simple, without really making people see how hard the disease is and how it affects survivors.\n\nFORMER NFL RUNNING BACK DEANGELO WILLIAMS SPONSORS 500 MAMMOGRAM SCREENINGS AFTER MOM'S BREAST CANCER DEATH\n\nAn Instagram account called \u201cbus_bros,\u201d for example, posted a photo in honor of breast cancer awareness month of a bright pink bus, with a very cutesy caption \u201cOnce Again October is Here and its Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Women are 1-8 Chances to Get Breast Cancer and Men Can Get it Too! Save the Ta Ta\u2019s by Getting Involved, Get Educated and Support Breast Cancer Awareness Month!!\u201d The caption uses one of the most commonly used sayings that has become popular among people raising awareness, \u201csave the Ta-Tas.\u201d\n\nRISK FACTORS FOR BREAST CANCER\n\nIn another post, @Iamstufft uploaded a recipe for a banana strawberry smoothie and said that it was her contribution to the #hellocookpinkchallenge, where people can upload photos of pink foods and attach recipes for making them during breast cancer awareness month.\n\nFor some, these are valiant attempts to further the cause of breast cancer, pass on awareness, and generate interest for the cause.\n\nGERRI WILLIS: I THOUGHT MY CANCER JOURNEY WAS OVER. I WAS WRONG\n\nBut there are also those who criticize the month, saying that it trivializes the experience of survivors and reduces that experience to something cute, pink, and stomach-able for those who don\u2019t know how hard the illness really is.\n\nOne breast cancer survivor, @andrenaburns, who finds breast cancer awareness month a detriment to the cause recently uploaded an an ironic photo of a bunch of pink balloons with nipples painted on them, so that together they look like a bunch of balloon breasts, \u201cI really fu@king struggle with Breast Cancer Awareness Month\u2026it feels like my entire world (my socials anyway) are awash with pink\u2026pink ribbons, t-shirts, and other useless ephemera along with frothy messages telling us that if we give our girls a squeeze every month\u2026well\u2026simply put, it will all be ok! I did, and it wasn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nWHEN SHOULD YOU GET A MAMMOGRAM?\n\nFor her, it seems the primary problem with breast cancer awareness month is that it makes the process of screening for breast cancer seem simple (as many campaigns emphasize the ease of self-breast-examinations) and that it doesn\u2019t recognize the true pain and difficulty that came after her diagnosis.\n\nIn an Instagram post from earlier this year, @themenopausecollective shed some awareness on \u201cpinkwashing\u201d and the cutesy nature of breast cancer campaigns at large in a post that illuminated two different voices. The first noted that as a result of ovarian cancer, she now has a \u201cfront bottom,\u201d pictured in the Instagram photo. She said that while everyone is busy focusing on breast cancer, ovarian cancer doesn\u2019t get the attention it deserves and that there is nothing pretty and cute about her front bottom, as the pink campaigns suggest.\n\nThe second voice that the post illuminates talks about the reality of breast cancer, and the lack of pretty pinkness in her experience of disease, \u201cDo you see anything pink and fluffy here? I don\u2019t. I simply see a broken, petrified and seriously unwell woman. A single mum of four. Three of them tiny babies. I didn\u2019t feel sexy or glossy or bosom focused on this day nine years ago. And I certainly wasn\u2019t giving much thought to who my \u2018bosom buddies\u2019 were. I simply wanted to stay alive. As I do now, dealing with my third diagnosis. Maybe it\u2019s time for a rethink?\u201d\n\nAs a result, post guides viewers to a writer named Gayle Sulik, whose 2010 book, \u201cPink Ribbon Blues: How Breast Cancer Culture Undermines Women\u2019s Health,\u201d looks at the trivializing impact of pink culture upon breast cancer survivors.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThe commercialization of breast cancer has contributed a lighthearted approach to awareness and advocacy\u2026This trivializes breast cancer and limits our ability to comprehend what it\u2019s really like to face the disease, live with medical uncertainty, and accept the difficult realities of risk, recurrence, treatment, and even death,\u201d she writes.\n\nThis article first appeared on SurvivorNet.com", "description": "As we enter the middle of breast cancer awareness month, SurvivorNet wanted to look at some different opinions on the month to better understand the debate around its impact, and the incredible amount of \u201cpink\u201d awareness raised each year for breast cancer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/breast_cancer_awareness_istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
