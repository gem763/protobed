It is believed the operation took place in midsummer.\n\nMr. Trump announced al-Asiri\u2019s killing as he insists he has a handle on the Turkish assault of American-allied Kurd fighters in northeast Syria.\n\nSome congressional Republicans say the U.S. has abandoned its friends in the region, though Mr. Trump said he\u2019s watching closely and will punish Turkey for missteps.\n\n\u201cI am trying to end the ENDLESS WARS. Talking to both sides,\u201d he tweeted early Thursday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
