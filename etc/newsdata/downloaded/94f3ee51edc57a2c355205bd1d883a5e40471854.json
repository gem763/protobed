With Covington having to undergo nasal surgery, the landscape at 170 moved on.\n\nWoodley ended up facing Darren Till at UFC 228 instead, successfully defending his title. But then he met Kamaru Usman, who took his title, ending his championship reign.\n\nSo now Covington will be facing \u201cThe Nigerian Nightmare\u201d for the title in the main event of UFC 245 on Dec. 14.\n\nAnd despite their being some back-and-forth with Usman, and a near altercation at the buffet line of the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Covington still thinks a fight with Woodley would have been bigger.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s definitely not as big a fight as the Woodley fight because of how much promoting I put into that fight,\u201d Covington told MMA Junkie. \u201cI was two years calling him out after every single fight and you know we had the backstory, we used to train at American Top Team, he was under the same roof as Dan Lambert, Dan Lambert is my agent and there\u2019s so many stories. The bad blood we had, also the political line. He\u2019s a liberal snowflake, I\u2019m team MAGA, I\u2019m dropping MAGA bombs out there so it just had so many different angles to the fight with Woodley.\u201d\n\nEven though his fight with Usman is getting the main event billing at the end-of-the-year card in Vegas, Covington says he\u2019s carrying the event, and the only reason people will be watching, is to see him compete.\n\n\u201cThis fight with \u2018Marty Fake Newsman\u2019 there\u2019s not a lot of angles,\u201d Covington said. \u201cI mean he\u2019s a boring fighter, no one cares about him. The only reason people are going to be tuning in on Dec. 14, it\u2019s because they want to see me win or they want to see me get knocked out but they\u2019re only tuning in to see me, they don\u2019t care about him. So it kinda sucks that I lost the Woodley fight but it is what it is.\u201d", "description": "Colby Covington thinks a title fight vs. Tyron Woodley would have been bigger than a fight with Kamaru Usman.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Blue Corner", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan", "The Blue Corner", "John Morgan", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/tyron-woodley-colby-covington.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
