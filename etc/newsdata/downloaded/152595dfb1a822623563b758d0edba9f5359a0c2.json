Hinch named Zack Greinke as his Game 1 starter against the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series.\n\nGreinke, 35, will be making his second postseason start for the Astros. The right-hander struggled in his first playoff start with the club, allowing six runs in 3 2/3 innings in Game 3 of Houston\u2019s ALDS series against the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nHinch hopes Greinke\u2019s next outing will end differently than the Astros\u2019 10-3 loss in Game 3 against the Rays.\n\n\u201cAs far as margin for error, he\u2019s got the same margin for error that he\u2019s had for having a league-leading ERA the last few years, approaching 20 wins and Cy Youngs,\u201d Hinch told reporters Friday. \u201cAnd his margin for error the last hundred starts that he\u2019s made has been the same.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned over the last few years here is every pitcher has a smaller margin for error than you can possibly imagine against elite teams.\u201d\n\nThe Astros also announced that Justin Verlander will start Sunday\u2019s Game 2 of the ALCS, while red-hot ace Gerrit Cole will take the mound for Game 3 on Tuesday at Yankee Stadium.\n\n\u201cGame 4, as you would imagine, will be [revealed] based on how the first three go,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cThree exceptional starting pitchers, and happy to line them up that way.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees announced the team will send out Masahiro Tanaka to oppose Greinke and the Astros in Game 1.", "description": "Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 Houston Astros manager A.J.
