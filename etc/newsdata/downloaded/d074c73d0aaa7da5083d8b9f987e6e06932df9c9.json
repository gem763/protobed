It suggests that women and men who binge drink in the months before conception are more likely to have children with congenital heart defects, with the father\u2019s alcohol consumption surprisingly having a greater impact on the future child\u2019s heart health.\n\nThe study, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, is a review of the existing research looking at the link between parental drinking and congenital heart disease in newborns, the most common type of birth defect. While pregnant women have long been told to avoid drinking, there\u2019s been considerably less attention paid to whether a father\u2019s drinking can affect the quality of his sperm and subsequently the health of his child.\n\nAs expected, the researchers did find a clear connection between reported drinking in mothers pre-conception as well as during pregnancy and the likelihood of their children being born with heart disease. But the highest associated risks were actually seen with fathers. The risk of any heart defect was 55 per cent higher for a child if their father was a regular binge drinker in the three months before conception (compared to abstinence), for instance, while only having a mother drink heavily during that same time period was associated with a 16 per cent higher risk.\n\nThere\u2019s been controversy over just how meaningful the health risks of drinking are for pregnant women. It isn\u2019t clear, for instance, whether a mother\u2019s light-to-moderate drinking actually increases the risk of birth defects. In this review, the authors didn\u2019t find a noticeable connection between drinking and congenital heart disease among women who reported \u201clow-dose exposures\u201d of alcohol a day. But they added that this study wouldn\u2019t be able to establish a cut-off point of \u201csafe\u201d alcohol consumption.\n\nAt the same time, we already know that binge drinking during pregnancy (defined as having five drinks in one session) is definitely bad for the foetus. And it\u2019s not an abstract risk either, since about 8 per cent of all live births end up having a congenital heart defect.\n\nThere\u2019s also been some research suggesting that even moderate drinking can affect the sperm quality of otherwise healthy men. Given the new findings, the authors suggest that both men and women abstain from at least binge drinking for up to six months before deciding to conceive.\n\n\u201cBinge drinking by would-be parents is a high risk and dangerous behaviour that not only may increase the chance of their baby being born with a heart defect, but also greatly damages their own health,\u201d said study author Jiabi Qin, a researcher at Central South University\u2019s Xiangya School of Public Health in China, in a statement released by the study\u2019s publisher.", "description": "Prospective parents \u2014 but especially dads \u2014 might be wise to avoid too much alcohol, according to a new study out this week.
