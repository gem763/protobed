He played 11 minutes, tallying seven points, six assists and a rebound in his team\u2019s 111-91 loss. Head coach Doc Rivers had suggested in training camp that Leonard might not play in the preseason at all out of caution, and he was reportedly ruled out for the Nuggets game Wednesday night.\n\nThe Clippers released a behind-the-scenes look at Leonard suiting up to play, however, and in the short clip, you can hear Patrick Beverley hint at why Leonard ended up playing. Beverley makes a clever \u201cboard man gets paid\u201d reference: \u201cI guess the board man got bored, huh?\u201d Beverley says, to which Leonard laughs, \u201cYes, I did.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThus, Leonard played, and his 11 minutes were not without a little flare. He made his first shot, then shortly thereafter, picked up a back-to-back steal and three-pointer. The Clippers\u2019 bench went appropriately wild.\n\nKawhi's first 3 for the Clips ... and the bench loved it \ud83d\udc4f pic.twitter.com/yMa2H3TlbV \u2014 NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) October 11, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nFans in attendance were understandably thrilled for the unexpected appearance, giving Leonard a warm welcome during his inaugural introduction at the Staples Center.\n\nFirst Clippers introduction for Kawhi Leonard. pic.twitter.com/g9qxDUmODi \u2014 Andrew Greif (@AndrewGreif) October 11, 2019\n\nDespite Leonard\u2019s sooner-than-expected debut, fans will likely still have to wait a few weeks longer to get a look at Paul George, who said he\u2019s targetting a \u201cNovember-ish\u201d return after undergoing multiple shoulder surgeries over the summer.\n\nKawhi Leonard played his first quarter as a Clipper Thursday night in Los Angeles.
