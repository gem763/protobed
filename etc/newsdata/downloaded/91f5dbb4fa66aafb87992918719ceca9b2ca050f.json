We are enjoying this, we are going to leave and we are going to win,\" he said.\n\nBBC political correspondent Helen Catt said his comments were unlikely to smooth tensions in Parliament, where MPs have expressed concern that Downing Street could seek to bypass legislation - passed earlier this month - to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe Benn bill - which Mr Johnson has been referring to as the \"surrender act\" - says the prime minister will have to ask the EU for an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline if he is unable to pass a deal in Parliament, or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit, by 19 October.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gina Miller: \"MPs should be ashamed of themselves\"\n\nFormer prime minister Sir John Major - who on Thursday accused Mr Johnson of \"wilfully\" destroying the prospects of a cross-party agreement on Brexit - expressed concern that the government might sidestep the law by suspending the act until after 31 October.\n\nSir John said he thought the government might be planning to do this by passing an Order of Council, which can be approved by Privy Councillors - government ministers - and has the force of law.\n\nOn Thursday night, Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly refused to rule the idea out.\n\nHe told BBC Question Time: \"I'm not going to discuss how we're going to progress through this.... I'm not going to talk through how the government intends to discharge its business, knowing full well that there are a whole load of people who will try and distort every procedure that we have in British politics to try and prevent that.\"\n\nHowever, former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he was confident any attempt to circumvent the act would fail.\n\nDowning Street has consistently said the government will obey the law, but Mr Johnson has also insisted he will not seek a delay to Brexit, which the act mandates.\n\n'Tempers need to come down'\n\nMeanwhile, the College of Bishops called on politicians to \"speak to others with respect\", adding that the result of the EU referendum \"should be honoured\".\n\n\"It is easy to descend into division and abuse - climbing out and finding unity again takes far longer,\" the college said in a statement.\n\n\"Further entrenching our divisions, whether from uncertainty or from partisanship, is not worthy of our country nor the leadership we now need.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Johnson \"deplores threats\" against MPs but doesn't apologise for his use of language\n\nEarlier on Thursday, MPs debated an urgent question over the use of language during Wednesday's stormy debate, with several members calling on the prime minister to apologise.\n\nElsewhere, a man was arrested for allegedly verbally abusing staff at Labour MP Jess Phillips' constituency office in Birmingham.\n\nIn interviews with the BBC, Mr Johnson acknowledged that \"tempers need to come down\" in Parliament.\n\nBut defending his use of the word \"surrender\", the prime minister added: \"I do think in the House of Commons it is important I should be able to talk about the surrender bill, the surrender act, in the way that I did.\"\n\nWhat is the Benn bill?\n\nWhen Mr Johnson talks about the \"surrender bill\", he is referring to the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act, also known as the Benn bill.\n\nThe act - which became law earlier this month - stipulates the prime minister will have until 19 October to either pass a deal in Parliament or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit.\n\nOnce this deadline has passed, he will have to request an extension to the UK's departure date to 31 January 2020 from the EU.\n\nIf the EU responds by proposing a different date, the PM will have two days to accept that proposal. But during this two-day period, MPs - not the government - will have the opportunity to reject the EU's date.", "description": "The issue of abuse will only be solved if MPs \"respect\" the referendum result, Dominic Cummings says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pdplx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
