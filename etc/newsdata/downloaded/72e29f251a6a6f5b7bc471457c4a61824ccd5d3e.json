Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton went on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America to promote their new project, The Book of Gutsy Women, which prompted the obvious question from host Amy Robach. Hillary\u2019s response ended up surprising even Chelsea, whose dad is the answer.\n\nSkip ahead to 4:45 if you don\u2019t want to hear Hillary\u2019s thoughts on impeachment:\n\n\u201cCan I ask you, what\u2019s the gutsiest thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d ABC News\u2019 Amy Robach asked Hillary Clinton at the conclusion of the joint interview. \u201cAh, boy, I think the gutsiest thing I\u2019ve ever done \u2014 well, personally, make the decision to stay in my marriage,\u201d she replied. \u201cPublicly, politically, run for president. And keep going. Just get up every day and keep going.\u201d When posed the same question, Chelsea Clinton appeared caught off guard by the unvarnished response from her mother, who was often criticized by pundits for a perceived lack of authenticity on the campaign trail. \u201cOh, goodness, I think I\u2019m so overwhelmed by my mother\u2019s answer that I\u2019m a bit out of words,\u201d she said, before citing her own role as a mom to three children.\n\nThat\u2019s er, one hell of a reveal on national television to Bill\u2019s daughter. Not that Chelsea would necessarily be surprised at the claim itself \u2014 after all, she had an unfortunate ringside seat to all of the drama \u2014 but she appeared shocked that Hillary would make that claim publicly.\n\nDoes a decision to stick with Bill qualify as a gutsiest moment, at least in the context of her public life? Maybe. Many people expected Hillary to discard Bill over his serial and indiscreet philandering after they left the White House, but she stuck with him. Bill was certainly a big political asset early in Hillary\u2019s Senate career, but his value was questionable by the time she ran against Barack Obama for the 2008 presidential nomination, and his baggage outweighed that value by the time she took the job as Secretary of State in 2009. By 2014-15, even before the #MeToo movement had really caught fire, Hillary got criticized for sticking with a victimizer husband, although it\u2019s equally arguable that dumping him in that period would have looked politically motivated too. (However, it\u2019s also clear that Hillary wasn\u2019t listening much to Bill about the campaign by that time, to her own detriment.)\n\nHad she spoken about the decision to stay with Bill in these terms in 2015, would Hillary have solved her \u201cauthenticity\u201d issue? Probably not, given that her campaign got mired early in her e-mail scandal and her serial lies and prevarications about it. In fact, Hillary uses this interview to continue the pretense that it was much ado about nothing, when it actually was an attempt to corruptly hide her communications as Secretary of State from Congress and the courts, more than half of which got destroyed after her home-brew system got discovered. But talking a little more honestly about that \u201cgutsiest\u201d decision rather than put out starry-eyed photos of the two of them on the campaign trail might have helped with that problem, if only incrementally.\n\nRobach also asks Hillary about impeachment based on her legitimately long track record on the subject. Rest assured that Hillary feels that Democrats are correct to go full speed ahead on an impeachment inquiry, not that this will surprise anyone:\n\nClinton said Tuesday she does not have concerns that Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are overreaching when it comes to pursuing the impeachment inquiry of Trump. \u201cI think the evidence concerning Ukraine is so dramatic and irrefutable because it came right out of the White House, so let the impeach inquiry proceed,\u201d she said, referring to a transcript of the July call released by the White House. \u201cI know that [House Democrats] will do a thoughtful, thorough job. Nobody should jump to any conclusions.\u201d\n\nI think dramatic and irrefutable is a little conclusion-jumping as it is, as it pretty much refutes the earlier allegations of explicit quid pro quos and intimidation.", "description": "Also: \"let the impeach inquiry proceed.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hillary-abc.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
