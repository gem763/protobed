He had struck a deal with Sony. It all seemed so easy, but was it? No. But it didn\u2019t hurt that he was Hideo Kojima.\n\nTowards the end of a Famitsu interview, Kojima talked about the difficulties he experienced setting up his own studio.\n\n\u201cIt was three years and nine months ago that I struck out on my own,\u201d Kojima told Famitsu. \u201cAt that time, I was 53 years old. That\u2019s an age in which you\u2019d retire, right? My family members were also against the idea [of me setting up a new studio]. I was a 53-year-old middle-aged guy, I didn\u2019t have any money or much of anything else, and it was just me saying I was going to make this open-world game.\u201d\n\nGranted, Kojima might have had money, but probably not enough to finance the type of projects he was used to making.\n\nAccording to Kojima, there were doubters that anyone thought the game would be good. \u201cThe reason for that is that there hasn\u2019t been a single world-famous game designer who has had success after striking out on their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven when I went to the bank, I couldn\u2019t borrow money.\u201d\n\nThere have been examples of developers setting up their own studios and being successful; however, there are many examples of devs setting up new studios and going bust.\n\nThis also sounds like he\u2019s rewriting history a little bit. When Kojima left Konami, I remember the general consensus seemed to be that people where happy he could go make a new style of game and, considering how he was reportedly treated, there was a desire to see him succeed.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean setting up his own studio was a cakewalk, especially in Japan, which can often make seemingly easy things complicated.\n\n\u201cEven when I went to the bank, I couldn\u2019t borrow money,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey said, \u2018We know you\u2019re renowned, but you don\u2019t have any actual results.\u2019 This is the kind of country Japan is.\u201d\n\nIt can be quite difficult to get a loan in Japan, especially if you are not working for a large company. Kojima was on his own at this point, so financing his studio so he could get an office lease and hire staff might have been harder than you would think. Plus, making Metal Gear games was expensive and took lots of time. Those games always seem to have done better outside of Japan. All of this might explain the reluctance on the part of this financial institution.\n\n\u201cBut then, there was a banker at the biggest bank [in Japan] who was a huge fan of mine, and I got the financing.\u201d\n\nEven though it was hard for him to get loan, he\u2019s still Hideo Kojima, which helps!\n\nHe\u2019d eventually be asked, \u201cWhat is Kojima Productions?\u201d\n\nTo give confidence to the families of the staff he was hiring, Kojima wanted to set up the studio in a nice building. That way, he said, it would look like the company was going to be successful, and husbands and wives of his employees would be less inclined to worry. But usually, whenever he\u2019d find a good building, he\u2019d eventually be asked, \u201cWhat is Kojima Productions?\u201d\n\nIn Japan, Kojima isn\u2019t as famous as someone like Hayao Miyazaki, so it seems like many landlords were unfamiliar with the studio\u2019s previous iteration and his work. But out of those desirable locations, he once again lucked out in finding a fan and was able to move into the studio\u2019s current location.\n\nCorporate Japan insulates employees. So challenges like getting a loan or a lease, which most people in Japan experience when trying to set up their own company, certainly were not what Kojima was accustomed to. But when faced with these challenges, he didn\u2019t give up. He recognised he had opportunities because of his Konami career.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I\u2019m who I am now is because of the thirty years I had at Konami,\u201d Kojima told Famitsu. \u201cI am grateful to Konami, and I cannot deny that connection.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Kojima has thanked Konami. It appears that he not only has come to terms with his former employer but also realises that the experience made him who he is.", "description": "Back in December 2015, Hideo Kojima announced that he was setting up his own studio Kojima Productions.
