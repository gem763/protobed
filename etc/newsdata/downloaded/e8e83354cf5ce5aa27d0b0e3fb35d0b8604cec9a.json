Like... you're mine. You're my lunch,' Mr Lami Lami told the ABC.\n\nElston Lami Lami (pictured) was bitten on the leg and groin by a saltwater crocodile off the coast of the Northern Territory\n\nMr Lami Lami was attacked after he mistakenly stepped on the 12 foot long crocodile (stock image)\n\nHe freed himself after kicking the animal with his other leg, before the crocodile attacked again, biting him on the groin.\n\nMr Lami Lami repeatedly punched the crocodile during his terrifying ordeal, before his barking dogs and a shouting relative managed to distract the crocodile so he could escape.\n\n'I hit him three times in the nose, he let me go. Come back again, try and attack me. When he snapped at me, I grabbed him, held him at the jaw with two hands and I was getting weak so I thought the only way to get his attention, I had to hit him again,' he said.\n\nMr Lami Lami believes the saltwater crocodile was about 4.5metres long.\n\nAfter the attack, Mr Lami Lami endured a half hour walk back to his car before he was treated at Minjilang Community Health Centre.\n\nA CareFlight medical response group met Mr Lami Lami there before he was airlifted to Royal Darwin Hospital.\n\nMr Lami Lami remains in a stable condition in hospital.", "description": "Elston Lami Lami was hunting through murky water near Minjilang on Croker Island at 12.30pm on Saturday when he stepped on what he thought was a submerged log.", "authors": ["Jackson Barron For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/07/20269498-0-image-a-2_1572246703387.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
