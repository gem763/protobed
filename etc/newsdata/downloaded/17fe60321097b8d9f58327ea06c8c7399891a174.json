But the news isn\u2019t all bad. In an encouraging sign, Congress might be on the verge of helping the country manage the far-reaching impacts of some of these events: The surface transportation reauthorization proposal recently approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee contains three measures that could signal wins ahead for conservationists, local communities, and the U.S. economy.\n\nSpecifically, the bill would invest in overdue maintenance at national parks, improve the flood-readiness of U.S. infrastructure, and increase the number of safe highway crossings for wildlife to help reduce vehicle-animal collisions. Although none of these measures is a complete solution for the issue it seeks to address, each is a needed step in the right direction.\n\nLet\u2019s start with our National Park System, which has a nearly $12 billion backlog of repairs \u2014 many vital to visitor safety, access to recreation opportunities, and protection of park resources. The needed repairs include outdated water, sewer and electrical systems; leaky roofs; crumbling historic structures; rotting artifacts; potholed roads; eroding trails; deteriorating monuments; and much more.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA recent poll commissioned by The Pew Charitable Trusts found that 82 percent of Americans want Congress to pass legislation to restore our national parks. These sites support over 325,000 jobs and, like other public lands, drive significant consumer spending in surrounding communities\u2014economic benefits that could be in jeopardy.\n\nThe bill, called America\u2019s Transportation Infrastructure Act of 2019, would guarantee $250 million over five years for transportation repairs at National Park Service (NPS) sites and on other public and tribal lands. Although not a panacea for repairing NPS\u2019 aging roads, bridges, and tunnels \u2014 the cost for which could exceed $6 billion \u2014 it\u2019s an encouraging start.\n\nThe bill makes a significant down payment on increasing the resiliency of America\u2019s roads, bridges, tunnels, and other infrastructure to the impacts of sea level rise and increased flooding\u2014realities that the measure\u2019s authors, Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman John Barrasso John Anthony BarrassoTo stave off a recession, let's pass a transportation infrastructure bill Overnight Defense: GOP wary of action on Iran | Pence says US 'locked and loaded' to defend allies | Iran's leader rules out talks with US GOP senator: Iran is behind attack on Saudi Arabia MORE (R-Wyo.) and ranking member Tom Carper Thomas (Tom) Richard CarperInstead of raising the gas tax, stop wasting money on frivolous projects To stave off a recession, let's pass a transportation infrastructure bill Overnight Energy: Trump tweets he's revoking California's tailpipe waiver | Move comes as Trump visits state | California prepares for court fight | Climate activist Greta Thunberg urges lawmakers to listen to scientists MORE (D-Del.), agree are growing threats to our economy and environment.\n\nThe costs of rebuilding after flood-related disasters have risen steadily in recent decades, topping a combined $845 billion since 2000. Numerous studies show that all levels of government could save enormous amounts of money by investing in disaster mitigation. In the case of the transportation sector, that could mean relocating roads out of the floodway, incorporating natural infrastructure to absorb water, or increasing the capacity of culverts. The bill dedicates $5 billion for states and communities to assess natural disaster vulnerabilities such as flooding and wildfires develop plans to address those risks, and carry out mitigation and resilience projects through a new grant program.\n\nFrom hurricanes Florence, Harvey, Irma and Michael to the wildfire in Paradise, Calif., and from catastrophic Midwest flooding to asphalt-buckling heat waves, record-setting weather-related events are becoming increasingly common.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe committee-passed bill makes an earnest attempt to promote activities that blunt the human, property, and financial costs of these events. But as committees in the House of Representatives turn to this legislation, lawmakers must improve it by requiring communities to account for and mitigate risk before they receive financial support for disasters.\n\nThe bill also dedicates $250 million to facilitate safe passage for wildlife across roads and highways while improving driver safety.\n\nFor 15 western states plus Texas and the Dakotas, an annual average of 33,571 vehicle collisions with wildlife kill 200 people per year and account for $1.16 billion in costs to families, governments, and insurers. Researchers estimate that these accidents also kill more than 176,000 wild animals annually.\n\nOne solution: Safe passage crossings. The construction of wildlife overpasses and underpasses along Colorado State Highway 9 resulted in an 89 percent drop in vehicle-wildlife collisions in the 2017-2018 winter compared to the average over the five years before construction, while allowing 16,238 mule deer safe passage across the road during that winter, according to research led by the Golden, Colo.-based firm Eco-resolutions.\n\nSimilarly, crossings and fencing along U.S. Route 191 in Wyoming yielded an 81 percent fall in such crashes from 2011 to 2014, according to a report prepared by Western Ecosystems Technology Inc. More wildlife crossings, strategically placed, should further lessen the number and severity of these accidents and help preserve many of the big game species that are part of U.S. culture and identity \u2014 and of the $887 billion outdoor recreation economy.\n\nWith these three provisions in the bill, Congress has an opportunity to show strong leadership on issues vital to Americans\u2019 safety, the economy, and the long-term health of our natural and built environments \u2014 while also telling a very good news story.\n\nTom Wathen leads The Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 land conservation projects, which span the Americas from the Arctic Ocean to the tip of South America.", "description": "Transportation measure could help ailing national parks and wildlife, and boost resiliency and disaster mitigation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/tetons-nationalpark-getty2017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
