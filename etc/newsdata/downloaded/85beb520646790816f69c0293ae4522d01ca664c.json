Gavin Newsom signed a new law Friday that will eventually ban privately operated prisons and jails, including immigration detention centers, in a move that could put a strain on Homeland Security\u2019s ability to hold illegal immigrants.\n\nThe law will initially block any new contracts between California jurisdictions and for-profit facilities. By 2028, the state will be banned from using private facilities altogether.\n\nSupporters said they also believe the law will shut down several private prisons that rent thousands of beds each day to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, making a major dent in the government\u2019s ability to hold people.\n\n\u201cThese for-profit prisons do not reflect our values,\u201d Mr. Newsom said in announcing his signature.\n\nCriminal justice reformers have crusaded for years for governments to cut ties with privately run facilities, arguing they are more dangerous and less humane for those incarcerated within.\n\nThe Obama administration, in its waning days, issued a policy attempting to cut Justice Department ties with private prisons \u2014 though Homeland Security rejected the move, saying it still considered private detention facilities a critical part of the immigration system.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
