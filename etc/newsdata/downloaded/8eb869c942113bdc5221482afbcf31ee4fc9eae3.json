Inflation has also persistently come in below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target, which further feeds the case for lowering rates.\n\nBut still-healthy consumer spending and a 50-year-low unemployment rate suggest the economy isn\u2019t in dire need of intervention.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s recent moves will take some time to ripple out into the broader economy, and the central bank will want to monitor how much its actions have helped; new GDP data released Wednesday morning showed that the U.S. economy grew by only 1.9 percent in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cThe Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate path\u201d for its main borrowing rate, it said.\n\nKansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, two of the central bank\u2019s 10 voting members, dissented, preferring to keep rates steady. Rosengren in particular has expressed worry that lower rates could feed risky asset bubbles.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1c/b4/649a34a64b52ae98a04f435ecf37/191029-federal-reserve-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
