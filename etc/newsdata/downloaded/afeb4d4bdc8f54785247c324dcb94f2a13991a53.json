REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/Files\n\nThe euro zone economy is ailing and inflation is worryingly weak, putting pressure on the central bank to prop up the 19-member currency bloc, much as it has done time and again over the last decade.\n\nDraghi is expected to oblige and deliver a fresh stimulus cocktail next Thursday, not least because others, particularly the Federal Reserve, are also easing.\n\nBut the hard part will be putting the package together.\n\nThe ECB has a wide range of tools at its disposal, but each has complications, from questionable efficacy and big side effects to outright opposition from certain key policymakers.\n\nThe problem is that the bloc\u2019s biggest troubles are outside the central bank\u2019s control: no amount of ECB stimulus can deliver a trade deal between the United States and China, boost Chinese growth, or get a Brexit deal signed and implemented.\n\nSo the best Draghi can hope for is to prop up confidence long enough for governments to do their job.\n\nThis is a dangerous gamble, some of his colleagues argue. The ECB has exhausted most of its firepower through years of stimulus, so it needs to chose its fights carefully and preserve its weapons for a real crisis.\n\nBut Draghi is likely to argue that imported troubles are already affecting the domestic economy, raising recession fears. Plus market expectations for stimulus are so high that a modest package would risk disappointing, pushing borrowing costs higher, not lower.\n\nQE OR NOT?\n\nThe most contentious point in next Thursday\u2019s debate will be whether to restart bond purchases, commonly known as quantitative easing.\n\nThis is the ECB\u2019s most powerful weapon, but over half a dozen policymakers, including the central bank chiefs of Germany, France, the Netherlands and Austria have expressed scepticism about the need for it.\n\nTheir argument is that long-term yields, the target of such buying, are already low and the bigger risk was a rise in short-term rates, which are best tackled with rate cuts and a better-formulated guidance on interest rates.\n\nDraghi is still likely to have the votes if he wanted to go ahead with bond purchases, but opposition from the bloc\u2019s biggest economies could be politically damaging.\n\nWhich way he goes is unlikely to be known even to other policymakers until just before the meeting, as has become customary during times of stress.\n\nBut without bond buys, the package is unlikely to be seen as powerful enough and risks disappointing markets.\n\nA compromise may be to approve a relatively small scheme to cement current financing conditions. Smaller buys could also let the ECB re-enter the market without having to modify its existing rules on bond buys, a controversial and legally contentious issue.\n\n\u201cQuite simply, a policy package that does not include QE will have no chance of closing the gap between the ECB\u2019s projection for inflation at the end 2021 and the ECB\u2019s inflation aim,\u201d ABN Amro said in a note.\n\nAn intangible argument for a more powerful package is to solidify Draghi\u2019s legacy. With Christine Lagarde taking over on Nov 1, the Sept 12 package may be Draghi\u2019s last big move to steer policy and cement his role as the champion of the euro.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, a rate cut appears to be the least contentious move, even if that also comes with complications.\n\nWhile a rate cut would lower short term corporate borrowing costs, the ECB\u2019s deposit rate is already at a record low of minus 0.4%, so a 10 or a 20 basis point cut would immediately hit bank profits.\n\nCommercial banks park excess reserves \u2014 more than 1 trillion euros now \u2014 at the ECB, so they essentially pay a fee for hoarding liquidity.\n\nRaising this fee risks thwarting lending, so the ECB is likely to compensate banks by exempting part of their cash from this charge through a multitiered deposit rate.\n\nWhile this will mean an immediate boost to banks, it\u2019s small and would disproportionately benefits banks in France and Germany, critics argue.\n\nAnother tool is to tweak the bank\u2019s interest rate guidance, better defining the conditions needed before rates can rise. Such a \u201creinforced\u201d guidance would push out rate hike expectations even further and would spare the ECB from having to modify this guidance every few months.\n\n\u201cGiven the cause of the slowdown, it would be a mistake to expect monetary policy to do everything,\u201d French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau said in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cThe ECB\u2019s monetary policy is doing its duty, but it can\u2019t do everything, and it certainly can\u2019t perform miracles.\u201d", "description": "European Central Bank President Mario Draghi - often credited with single-handedly saving the euro during the worst of its crisis - is expected to perform more magic next week in his penultimate meeting in charge.", "authors": ["Balazs Koranyi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426995561&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851NY", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
