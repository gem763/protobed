Running for president of the United States as a Democratic candidate.\n\nAge: 54\n\nFamily: Harris is married to lawyer Douglas Emhoff.\n\nHometown: Oakland, California\n\nPolitical party: Democratic\n\nPrevious jobs: Attorney General of California from 2011 to 2017. San Francisco District Attorney from 2004 to 2011.\n\nBased on a recurring series of national surveys we conduct, we can figure out who the other candidates competing in Kamala Harris' lane are, and who the broader opponents are within the party.\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren : While the percentage of Democrats said they would be satisfied with Warren as nominee is in the mid-forties, the percentage of Harris fans who would be satisfied with the Senator from Massachusetts atop the ticket is nearing 60 percent. That more than 10 percentage point bump is the largest of any other candidate , meaning that the two will be competing early for many of the same voters.\n\n: While the percentage of Democrats said they would be satisfied with Warren as nominee is in the mid-forties, the percentage of Harris fans who would be satisfied with the Senator from Massachusetts atop the ticket is nearing 60 percent. That , meaning that the two will be competing early for many of the same voters. Sen. Cory Booker: While many of Harris' fellow senators overlap with her considerably, only Warren and Booker see broader support among Harris voters specifically than Democrats as a whole. While Harris fans were, for instance, less likely to favor Sen. Amy Klobuchar than your typical half of Harris voters would also be satisfied with Booker as nominee, teeing up an early rivalry.\n\nINSIDER has been conducting a recurring poll through SurveyMonkey Audience on a national sample to find out how different candidate's constituencies overlap. We ask people whether they are familiar with a candidate, whether they would be satisfied or unsatisfied with that candidate as nominee, and sometimes we also ask whether they think that person would win or lose in a general election against President Donald Trump.\n\nRead more about how we're polling this here.\n\nWhat are Kamala Harris' policy positions?\n\nWhat are Kamala Harris' political successes?\n\nHow much money has Kamala Harris raised?\n\nHarris raised $1.5 million from 38,000 online donors in the 24 hours after she announced her presidential bid in late January. The average contribution was $37.\n\nHarris' campaign raised $12 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $11.8 million from 279,000 in the second quarter.\n\nCould Kamala Harris beat President Trump?\n\nReferring back to INSIDER's recurring poll, Kamala Harris overall is believed to be a stronger candidate in a general election against Donald Trump than your typical Democrat.\n\nWhile it's still quite early and many remain unsure about the general election, about two in five voting Democrats think Harris would win in the general election, while about 3 in 10 think she would lose. That is better than the average Democratic nominee according to INSIDER's survey.\n\nAmong all respondents, Harris is on par with your typical Democrat.\n\nHow is Kamala Harris viewed by voters compared to the competition?\n\nINSIDER has conducted a number of other polls to check in on how these candidates are perceived in comparison to one another. When we asked respondents to one poll to rank how far to the left or to the right they considered the candidates, Harris was generally considered to be one of the most left-leaning candidates in the field, somewhat in contrast to her prosecutorial history but plausibly owing to a push from her campaign to appeal to left-leaning voters. Harris was among the more experienced candidates in the field when we asked respondents to rank the candidates based on how prepared they are for the rigors of the presidency given what they knew about their history of public service and experience with government. And when asked how likable or personable respondents perceived the candidates to be, Harris was in the top five.\n\nHow do Democratic voters feel about Kamala Harris's qualifications?\n\nINSIDER has conducted polling about how voters feel about candidate attributes or qualifications. We asked respondents about a list of possible qualifications and if they made them more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate for president.\n\nFor example, among respondents who said they'd vote in the Democratic primary, 19% said a candidate being a college professor made them likelier to support them, while 4% said it made them less likely to, for a +15% net favorability. We can then see how different candidates' resumes stack up compared to those preferences.\n\nAttributes perceived as most valuable include her released tax returns (+43%), position in the Senate (+40%), status as a child of immigrants (+21%), and past as an attorney general (+13%), district attorney (+7%) and lawyer (+3%).\n\nAttributes considered to be a liability based on the preferences of self-reported Democratic voters include her history as a prosecutor (-1%) and that she grew up wealthy (-42%).\n\nRead more of our best stories on Kamala Harris:", "description": "Kamala Harris, a US senator from California, is also the state's former attorney general and a former San Francisco prosecutor.", "authors": ["Eliza Relman"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c8c2a10daa5075fd80cc4c6-2732-1366.jpg"}
