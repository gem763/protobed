Markets had been expecting a quarter-point rate cut.\n\nAt the time, the RBNZ declared it would do \"whatever it takes\u201d, echoing the famous promise by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi that preceded an era of zero per cent interest rates that Europe has not escaped.\n\nHowever, low interest rates could also encourage asset price bubbles, including in housing markets, the central banker said.\n\nMr Bascand said on Wednesday: \u201cThe challenge is when interest rates are low, which is in many ways good for debt servicing. Households can accommodate higher levels of debt given their incomes.\n\nHouseholds remain vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks \u2014 Geoff Bascand, RBNZ chairman\n\n\u201cDebt servicing is not the only measure of vulnerability. Households remain vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks. A shock that hits incomes is not reflected in lower interest rates, it\u2019s reflected in less ability to pay.\"\n\nNew Zealand remained vulnerable to debt repricing risks. \"Most of our debt is longer term than it was before but it\u2019s not immune to significant price shocks,\u201d Mr Bascand said.\n\nHe also addressed the central bank\u2019s capital proposals for the banking sector, further details of which are expected to be announced in early December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is a benefit side and a cost side,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cost side comes from the cost of equity being somewhat higher than the cost of debt to an institution and flowing through to banks\u2019 margins.\n\n\u201cAll of those things are part of the work that goes on and we are revisiting all of that at present in the light of submissions from banks and submissions from other parties and discussions with experts and trying to get it to a point where we are confident that the benefits exceed the costs. Not just finely balanced, but where we are confident.''\n\nUnder the RBNZ proposals, banks will have to hold more capital. The large New Zealand banks are owned by Australian institutions, which lend roughly nine out of 10 dollars in New Zealand.\n\nMr Bascand said: \u201cAt the moment, most of the banks are capitalised in common equity terms at around 12 per cent. In tier-one terms, it is nearly 14 per cent. We are asking them to go to 16 per cent. All of these proposals are about increasing our conservation buffer in a broad sense.\u201d", "description": "Deputy governor Geoff Bascand says one possible move is negative interest rates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4306%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_757%2C$y_170/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5e476fd78b8025cfea5c185996fa6a8b0f3542c9", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
