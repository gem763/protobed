He soon recognized, he said, that regulators\u2019 responses would struggle to keep pace with the wealth of new ideas:\n\n\u201cMy conclusion was, any action by the government \u2014 really up until the last 2, 3 years \u2014 would be negative, would impair innovation and would restrict the development of cryptocurrencies and their enormous value, now and in the future.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s far better, he continued, for Capitol Hill to slowly become more informed about the industry \u201crather than rush to go kill \u2014 or try to kill \u2014 an idea.\u201d\n\nAs the industry has evolved, he argued that we\u2019ve entered a different phase: one that now needs smarter regulation and increased certainty from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as well as a clarification from the U.S. Treasury and IRS in regard to taxing authority.\n\n\u201cReal government work still needs to be done,\u201d he noted.\n\nTo this end, he has this week reintroduced the Financial Services Innovation Act. The bill proposes the creation of financial service innovation offices within each of the ten different federal offices that deal with financial service issues.\n\nThe bill, he said, will ensure that regulators are \u201cinnovation-forward and situated to say yes rather than no. I want the default to be yes, not no.\u201d\n\nWorking for, not against, innovation\n\nMcHenry outlined that the creation of these offices would establish something similar to what other jurisdictions call a \u201cregulatory sandbox.\u201d His proposed term, \u201cpermanent beta testing,\u201d would work on the same principles.\n\nRegulatory agencies would be able to offer innovators in the crypto space to enter into an enforcement compliance agreement: once accepted, this would allow them to provide services under a modified compliance plan, with certain waivers for out of date measures or unduly burdensome.\n\nFor agencies such as the SEC and CFTC and others, he argued that the bill represents a necessary step to establishing a regulatory process that works with, not against, innovation.\n\nAs reported, McHenry told lawmakers this summer that:", "description": "U.S. Congressman Patrick McHenry, who represents North Carolina\u2019s 10th District, says he wants regulators\u2019 default reaction to crypto innovation to be \u201cyes.\u201d", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZjYyYzliODE1MWI5YWMzN2VmNmYwNDk3YjdmNjdjNTEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
