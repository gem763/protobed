FOMC said it will \u201cassess the path\u201d which sounds like a neutral stance on additional cuts. The FOMC completed a \u201cmid-cycle\u201d rate adjustment today and we expect no more cuts ahead.#fomc \u2014 stuart hoffman (@StuHoffmanPNC) October 30, 2019\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell said policy would remain steady as long as \u201cincoming information about the economy was broadly consistent\u201d with the Fed\u2019s forecast of moderate economy growth, a strong labor market and inflation near the 2% target.\n\n\u201cWe believe monetary policy is in a good place to achieve these outcomes,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe see the current stance of policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook.\u201d\n\nWhat might cause the Fed to cut more?\n\nPowell said the Fed would respond to \u201cany development that cause a material reassessment of our outlook.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, we will be monitoring the effects of our policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the fed funds rate,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly. Policy is not on a preset course.\u201d\n\nEconomists think the Fed will now refrain from cutting rates again at its next policy meeting in mid-December, but many see the central bank easing in 2020 because they expect the economy to slow down.\n\n\u201cOur own view is that several further easing moves are likely over the course of next year,\u201d said Josh Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc., in a note to clients.\n\nPowell said the Fed would only reverse course and tighten policy if inflation threatens to rise sharply.\n\n\u201cI think we would need to see a really significant move up in inflation that is persistent before we would consider raising rates to address inflation,\u201d the Fed chairman said.\n\nIndeed, Powell said the Fed was watching to make sure that low inflation expectations don\u2019t sink.\n\n\u201cWe are mindful that continued below-target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in long-term inflation expectations,\u201d he added.\n\nThe most important part of the Fed\u2019s statement was what the central bankers didn\u2019t say.\n\nPolicy makers removed language in place since the summer promising the Fed would \u201cact as appropriate\u201d to sustain the expansion which had been a signal that monetary policy easing was in train. The Fed had used that phrasing with each of its June, July and September statements.\n\nRead: Live blog of Fed decision and Powell presser\n\nBy taking away the \u201cact as appropriate\u201d language, the Fed is trying to guide the market not to expect more cuts for now.\n\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George both dissented. They have voted against all three rate cuts and argued that easing was unnecessary until more signs of economic weakness were evident. Cutting rates now would give the Fed less ammunition to combat a downturn in the future and might foster financial imbalances, they warned\n\nPowell was upbeat about the outlook, saying that consumers have been resilient. Things look brighter than in late September, he said.\n\n\u201cWe also see the risks to the outlook as perhaps having moved in a positive direction...although some things remain to be seen,\u201d Powell said.\n\nThe chairman said he was referring to potential improvement in the trade war with China and reduced prospects of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe government reported earlier Wednesday that third-quarter GDP growth rose at a better-than-expected 1.9% annual rate.\n\nBefore the statement, the market had priced in a 30% chance of a rate cut in December. Those probabilities sank to 20% after Powell had finished, according the the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nPowell noted that if the economy \u201cto be all it can be,\u201d fiscal policy makers should act to boost the potential growth rate.\n\n\u201cI am not asking Congress to do anything right now,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields fell after the Fed decision. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -3.36% fell 3.3 basis points, its biggest drop since the beginning of the month.\n\nStocks reacted positively to the Fed\u2019s policy statement and Powell\u2019s press conference. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.43% closed up over 115 points to 27,186 and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.33% was up 9.88 points to close at 3,046.77, a new record high.", "description": "The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate for the third meeting in a row but signaled it may pause its policy changes.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP415_powell_ZG_20190814114630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
