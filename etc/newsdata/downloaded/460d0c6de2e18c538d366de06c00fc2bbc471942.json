The former Google project could soon unleash an autonomous taxi fleet without a human backup driver at the wheel\n\nBoth early Waymo and Waymo One customers have received the email, which says the firm has been has been testing and refining its self-driving tech and that the riders may see Waymo vehicles that have no safety driver behind the wheel.\n\nWaymo noted that if the person hailing the ride gets matched with a fully-driverless car, there will be a notification in the app that the car won\u2019t have a trained driver upfront.\n\nThere is also a \u2018What to expect\u2019 button in the app, which gives more background to riders about their driverless journey.\n\nAnd Waymo has also shared that support is always available if customers need help \u2013 they just simply press the car\u2019s help button or the help feature in the app.\n\nThe email notes that customers who are matched with a fully driverless vehicle in its ride-hailing app will be notified so they won\u2019t be surprised to see an empty front seat when the car arrives\n\n\u2018Rest assured, Waymo will still be taking care of you; this is just the next step as we travel down the road toward a fully self-driving future,\u2019 reads the email.\n\nTen-year-old Waymo is widely viewed as the leader of the self-driving race, but attaining the holy grail of full and safe automation remains challenging as companies in the field seek to recoup their research and development costs.\n\nGoogle began development of this technology is 2009 in the confines of its secretive X lab.\n\nIn 2014, the tech giant shared its first prototype with the world and in 2016, Waymo was renamed, and made into its own separate division in Alphabet.\n\nJust last month, Waymo CEO John Krafcik, said his company is exploring deploying its self-driving technology in the trucking industry.\n\nHOW DO SELF-DRIVING CARS 'SEE'? Self-driving cars often use a combination of normal two-dimensional cameras and depth-sensing 'LiDAR' units to recognise the world around them. However, others make use of visible light cameras that capture imagery of the roads and streets. They are trained with a wealth of information and vast databases of hundreds of thousands of clips which are processed using artificial intelligence to accurately identify people, signs and hazards. In LiDAR (light detection and ranging) scanning - which is used by Waymo - one or more lasers send out short pulses, which bounce back when they hit an obstacle. These sensors constantly scan the surrounding areas looking for information, acting as the 'eyes' of the car. While the units supply depth information, their low resolution makes it hard to detect small, faraway objects without help from a normal camera linked to it in real time. In November last year Apple revealed details of its driverless car system that uses lasers to detect pedestrians and cyclists from a distance. The Apple researchers said they were able to get 'highly encouraging results' in spotting pedestrians and cyclists with just LiDAR data. They also wrote they were able to beat other approaches for detecting three-dimensional objects that use only LiDAR. Other self-driving cars generally rely on a combination of cameras, sensors and lasers. An example is Volvo's self driving cars that rely on around 28 cameras, sensors and lasers. A network of computers process information, which together with GPS, generates a real-time map of moving and stationary objects in the environment. Twelve ultrasonic sensors around the car are used to identify objects close to the vehicle and support autonomous drive at low speeds. A wave radar and camera placed on the windscreen reads traffic signs and the road's curvature and can detect objects on the road such as other road users. Four radars behind the front and rear bumpers also locate objects. Two long-range radars on the bumper are used to detect fast-moving vehicles approaching from far behind, which is useful on motorways. Four cameras - two on the wing mirrors, one on the grille and one on the rear bumper - monitor objects in close proximity to the vehicle and lane markings.\n\n'Ride-hailing is an important application of our Driver,' Krafcik told political and industry leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, at the event's official opening.\n\n'Our technology can also make trucking safer and stronger, and fill a pressing need for more drivers in many parts of the world.\u2019\n\n'We\u00b4ve already conducted road tests of the Waymo Driver in Class 8 trucks across the U.S., and we\u00b4re working closely with the ecosystem - shippers, truck makers, and Tier One suppliers - to ensure a successful deployment.'", "description": "An email went out to Waymo customers inb Phoenix, AZ letting them know that 'completely self-driving cars are on the way' for its ride-hailing service without  a human back-up driver.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19544588-0-image-a-8_1570720054333.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
