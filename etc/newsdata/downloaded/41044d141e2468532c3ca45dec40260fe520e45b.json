Because I would love to ask you a few questions.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAnd she said: \"Because the press have made me this objectified ex-model pole dancer, I really am not going to answer that question.\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to put myself in a position for you to weaponise my answer. I'm being used as a pawn.\"\n\nShe added: \"The first initial reaction is to deny everything... but then when I saw the way I'm objectified, and dragged through the press with all these misquotes and interpretations of who I am, I can't believe... if I'd looked a different way, or I was a man, I wouldn't be objectified.\"\n\nGood Morning Britain persisted in asking, saying it was not about objectification but \"politics and influence\" and was \"clearly relevant\" to alleged impropriety. But she said: \"I\u2019m not answering, that\u2019s my record.\"\n\nShe said the question was not relevant, saying: \"Categorically, Boris had nothing to do with all my other achievements\".\n\nAsked if she loved the former London mayor, Ms Arcuri said: \"I\u2019ve been asked that many times.\n\n\"I care about him deeply as a friend and we do share a very close bond.\n\n\"But I wish him well. I want him to be happy. I wish Carrie well. And I really do want him to focus on making Britain great again.\"\n\nMs Acruri gained access to three trade missions Mr Johnson led in 2014 and 2015, while Mayor of London. She was also given \u00a3126,000 in public funds in the form of three separate deals.\n\nOne grant was from the organisation London & Partners for which Johnson was responsible as London mayor - handing her firm \u00a310,000 sponsorship money for an event in 2013.\n\nToday she said she \"categorically\" did not get the money because of her friendship with Boris Johnson. Instead she said she was chosen for her \"big mouth\" and tech skills.\n\nAsked if she ever asked for his help to get grants she said: \"Categorically no, never.\"\n\n(Image: Paul Clarke)\n\nOne of the trade trips was to Tel Aviv - where she was reportedly allowed to go despite previously being blocked by other City Hall staff. But speaking of a City Hall approver she said: \"She didn\u2019t sit me down and let me pass because I was Boris\u2019s friend.\"\n\nMs Arcuri also denied the then-Mayor wrote her a letter of recommendation for her application to a \u00a3100,000-a-year quango job when she was 27.\n\nShe said it was untrue despite putting it on her CV and writing herself in 2014 email: \"I still have the letter of rec from Boris. hahaha.\"\n\nAsked if she was lying in that e-mail, she said today: \"Of course!\" She added it was a \"silly email\" that was \"playing along\" with right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\nThis breaking news story is being updated.", "description": "The PM's ex-pal denied getting 'favours' but refused 7 times to tell ITV's Good Morning Britain if they had an intimate relationship - in a jaw-dropping interview that ranged from pole-dancing to trade trips", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Itv", "Paul Clarke"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528159.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jennifer-Arcuri.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
