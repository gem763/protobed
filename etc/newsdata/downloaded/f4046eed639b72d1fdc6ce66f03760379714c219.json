But he's one of many sellers frustrated by what they say is a tilted playing field on the platform, particularly when it comes to competing Amazon private labels. (Scott McIntyre for The Washington Post)\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 When Jeff Peterson\u2019s Amazon seller account was hacked recently, he frantically tried to reach Amazon\u2019s customer service for help restoring access to his sports memorabilia store.\n\nAs nearly 4,000 fraudulent orders rang up, the Garden Grove, Calif.-based seller called Amazon\u2019s seller support line, phoned its main customer service number, reached out via a separate account on its Canadian site, and even sent an email to chief executive Jeff Bezos. Nothing worked.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get any answers from Amazon at all to fix this,\u201d Peterson said, as negative reviews of his service accumulated, decimating his business.\n\nOne thing he hadn\u2019t done was pay as much as $5,000 a month for a program Amazon offers sellers as a way to get quick help from a real person.\n\nAmazon has become a powerful marketplace alongside its role as an online retailer, with more than 2.5 million third-party sellers who have become global businesses on its platform. Early on, Amazon compelled sellers to use its warehouses to guarantee speedy Prime shipping, in addition to other programs that largely benefited consumers. But now, sellers and former employees familiar with Amazon\u2019s internal strategy say the company is increasingly focused on boosting its profits on the backs of its sellers \u2014 often without any clear upside for customers.\n\nThe services include charging sellers thousands of dollars to speak to account managers, as well as making it necessary to purchase ads to guarantee the top spot on a search page. Plus, Amazon is aggressively pushing its own brands \u2014 something that may be cheaper for consumers in the short run, but demonstrates its overall power over pricing and merchandise on the site. That gives it an advantage over rival products and sellers who rely on Amazon for their livelihood and have few alternatives if they want to thrive selling online.\n\nAmazon says its success is dependent on those sellers and insists it always prioritizes shoppers.\n\nAs much as a third of every dollar merchants make goes back to Amazon, according to consultants and sellers. That helped Amazon generate $42.7 billion in revenue from seller services such as fees and commissions last year, a number that has nearly doubled in two years.\n\nThat has drawn the attention of regulators and lawmakers both in the U.S. and abroad, who are investigating Amazon and other large tech companies for potential violations of antitrust law and abusing dominant marketplace power. Traditionally, U.S. regulators have focused on consumer harm, but officials recently emphasized the need to look at the way several tech giants are using their market clout to lower quality, reduce innovation and diminish consumer privacy as officials consider regulating giants of the digital economy.\n\nWith regard to Amazon, the Federal Trade Commission appears to be probing how the online retail giant decides who wins each sale and at what price, as well as how Amazon can harm competition by suspending seller accounts or changing its rules with little notice and without appropriate ways to appeal those decisions. The FTC, which has taken on oversight of Amazon, has been reaching out to sellers on those topics in recent weeks, according to sellers who declined to be named due to concern about retribution from Amazon. FTC spokeswoman Cathy MacFarlane declined to comment.\n\nIn July, the European Union launched an investigation into Amazon\u2019s conflicting roles as both a platform and a retailer of its own products. And the German competition agency reached a deal with Amazon, in part requiring the company to offer third-party sellers 30 days\u2019 notice before suspending accounts. Amazon said at that time it would cooperate fully with the E.U. \u201cand continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s approach is similar to the way Apple built its iPhone app store, in which developers both play by its rules and compete against the tech giant. And it also resembles the way Microsoft, decades ago, used technology to restrict the types of software that could run on its Windows operating system even as it developed its own competing applications.\n\n[How Apple uses its App Store to copy the best ideas]\n\nAmazon notes that third-party sellers sold $160 billion in merchandise on the site worldwide in 2018, or 58 percent of all physical merchandise sold. \u201cThird-party sellers are kicking our first party butt. Badly,\u201d Bezos wrote in his annual letter to shareholders in April, winning against the company\u2019s own retail operations. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nSellers are a crucial piece of Amazon\u2019s business, and the company invests billions of dollars in digital tools and physical infrastructure to help them thrive, said spokesman Jack Evans.\n\n\u201cAmazon only succeeds when sellers succeed and any claims to the contrary are simply wrong,\u201d Evans said. \u201cSellers have full control of their business and make the decisions that are best from them, including the products they choose to sell, pricing, and how they choose to fulfill orders.\u201d\n\nEvans disputes the company has prioritized profits over serving consumers, noting that it invests heavily in driving traffic to its site and improving its infrastructure, which benefits third-party sellers, too. Many of the company\u2019s fees are for optional services, and it has recently lowered some.\n\nStill, many third-party sellers say they worry about Amazon\u2019s dual role: a massive open marketplace and a giant competitor in that marketplace. Those sellers complain \u2014 increasingly publicly \u2014 that Amazon\u2019s ever-increasing power has resulted in a system in which only a few can succeed, and only through paying up.\n\nFor every dollar that shoppers spend on products from third-party merchants, as much as 30 to 35 cents goes back to Amazon to cover commissions, advertising buys, account management deals and more, said James Thomson, a former senior manager in business development at Amazon and now partner at brand consultancy Buy Box Experts.\n\nTwo-thirds of U.S. shoppers usually start their search for products on Amazon rather than on Google or another retail website, according to a March survey from Feedvisor, a company that helps Amazon\u2019s third-party sellers with pricing. When people shop on Amazon, they often don\u2019t recognize whether they\u2019re buying products directly or from a third-party.\n\n[Attention, Walmart executives: Amazon\u2019s coming after your low-income shoppers]\n\nAmazon is the largest online retail site, and it should account for about 37.7 percent of U.S. e-commerce sales this year, according to the research firm eMarketer. And many sellers say business from Amazon accounts for 75 percent or more of their annual sales.\n\nIt can be less costly to do business on other platforms. Some other marketplaces don\u2019t charge the same broad range of fees on top of their commissions. Walmart\u2019s commissions for sales by third-party merchants are similar to Amazon\u2019s, according to the companies\u2019 websites. EBay is cheaper still, taking, for example, just 9.2 percent the cost of jewelry sales compared to 20 percent at Amazon. EBay, though, also charges another roughly 3.5 percent payment-processing fee, company spokesman Ryan Moore said.\n\nBut eBay, Walmart and other retailers make up a fraction of U.S. third-party marketplace space. Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Colin Sebastian estimates that third-party sellers generated roughly $90 billion in U.S. sales for the online retail giant last year \u2014 a little more than half what it generated globally. Amazon doesn\u2019t break out the domestic number. That compares to $33 billion at eBay, he said. And third-party sales at Walmart are \u201cnegligible in comparison,\u201d Sebastian added.\n\nAmazon, though, views the market differently. Amazon argues that it is part of the total retail market, of which it accounts for less than 4 percent domestically.\n\n[Amazon\u2019s strategy to win over congressional critics: Tours of its giant warehouses]\n\nIts e-commerce dominance has allowed Amazon to make major changes that can result in a ripple effect across its marketplace. For example, late last year Amazon struck a new deal with Apple to sell its products on its website. But the deal also made it much more difficult for third-party merchants to sell used iPads, Macbooks and more, according to some sellers. Now, they need to use genuine Apple replacement parts on those refurbished items, among other requirements, Amazon\u2019s Evans said.\n\nJosh Gibson says his Seattle-based CTG Inc.\u2019s sales plummeted after removing his Apple stock from the site. \u201cWe peeled out because we weren\u2019t going to compete against Amazon,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThe house always wins.\u201d\n\nU.S. lawmakers are also looking at Amazon\u2019s efforts to boost its advertising sales, a business that accounted for roughly $3 billion in revenue in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nAt a House hearing in July, Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) said, \u201cBecause businesses are increasingly dependent on Amazon, some of them are concerned that Amazon is using its ad business to squeeze more money.\u201d Amazon lawyer Nate Sutton replied that advertising isn\u2019t necessary to succeed on Amazon.\n\nJason Boyce, a onetime merchant on Amazon who is now a consultant to those third-party sellers, disagrees. \u201cIf you don\u2019t advertise, you lose organic sales,\u201d Boyce said of transactions not driven by ads. That\u2019s because Amazon directs shoppers to products that sell well, in turn hampering items without ad dollars behind them.\n\n[Justice Department announces broad antitrust review of big tech]\n\nHis outdoor company Dazadi.com sold an air hockey table that won hundreds of positive reviews and consistently landed in the top three search results, free. A few years ago, after Amazon introduced sponsored ads, his hockey table dropped in results, he said. Boyce decided to pay $5,000 to $10,000 a month for advertising to recover top placement.\n\nWhen Boyce left Dazadi last year, it was spending nearly $400,000 annually \u2014 about 2 percent of its total sales \u2014 on all its Amazon advertising, just to make sure its product pages were among the leading results.\n\n\u201cIt was freakin\u2019 painful,\u201d Boyce said. Dazadi did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe vast majority of sellers have built and run their businesses without advertising on Amazon, company spokesman Evans said.\n\nLawmakers have also pointed in hearings to Amazon\u2019s ever-increasing fees as potential evidence of a monopoly.\n\n[Amazon has \u2018destroyed\u2019 retail and should be scrutinized, Treasury chief Mnuchin says]\n\nRecently, a hacker hijacked Sanjay Chandiram\u2019s Amazon listing for a kids\u2019 walkie-talkie and recategorized it under \u201csex toys,\u201d a tactic employed by rogue sellers as a weapon to ensure a product drops out of competition. Chandiram, the chief executive of Bellevue, Wash.-based Kaliber Global, spends $5,000 a month for a service called Amazon\u2019s Marketplace Growth, where he has an account manager who fixed the problem within 48 hours.\n\nDespite Chandiram\u2019s seven-year record selling on Amazon, as well as being a top-150 seller, he said it can be nearly impossible to get help from Amazon\u2019s mostly automated systems without the service, so he pays up. He now also has to spend millions of dollars advertising on the site.\n\n\u201cThe overall treatment sellers receive from Amazon is nowhere close to the way they treat their customers,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are not treated as partners in this relationship. Things are pretty one-sided.\u201d\n\nBut if sellers aren\u2019t willing to pay, they say the results can be devastating.\n\nPeterson, the hacked seller of memorabilia and collectibles supplies, said it took three-and-a-half weeks before he was able to access his account. But the damage was done. Amazon froze the payments for the 4,000 orders, and has since refunded them to customers. Shoppers trashed his store, Perfect Sports Fan, in reviews as \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d and a \u201cscam.\u201d Those negative comments are key factors in Amazon\u2019s search algorithms, and have tanked sales. (Amazon removed the comments after Post inquiries.)\n\nBefore the hack, Perfect Sports generated about $5,000 a day in sales on Amazon, which accounted for about 75 percent of the company\u2019s total revenue. Peterson estimates he lost about $225,000 in sales during the 45 days his business was paralyzed, forcing him to lay off three employees.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Evans said the company handled more than 40 million contacts from sellers last year, and that 80 percent of their issues were resolved within 24 hours. He declined to comment on individual sellers\u2019 experiences.\n\nRegulators are also asking sellers about the hawking of Amazon\u2019s now more than 100 private-label brands.\n\nOver the past few years, Amazon has drawn on copious sales data from products on its site to help determine markets to target with its own homegrown products. The company\u2019s private-label goods include everything from batteries to vitamin supplements and diapers to nicotine gum. The company has recently been pitching those items next to the box on product pages where customers add items to their carts.\n\n[Aggressive Amazon tactic pushes you to consider its own brand before you click \u2018buy\u2019]\n\nLast month, the House Judiciary Committee asked Amazon to provide extensive records related to how it prices and displays its products alongside those sold by rival sellers.\n\nMiami-based seller Brandon Young sells a hanging toiletry bag that was doing well before Amazon introduced its own version last year. Amazon also added a new row of items high up on the page under the heading \u201cTop rated from our brands.\u201d Young\u2019s bag dropped from the top two rows to below the first screen of the results, and sales were halved overnight to 70 a day. To salvage sales, he cut the price of the bag by $4 to $10.99. The AmazonBasics version sells for $12.22.\n\n\u201cThere is definitely an unfair advantage that they have for their brands that they don\u2019t offer other sellers,\u201d Young said.\n\nLike other retailers, the company studies overall sales to make decisions, Amazon\u2019s Evans said. Amazon does not give itself preferential or exclusive placement in the product search rankings, he added, calling the \u201ctop rated\u201d row of items \u201cmerchandising\u201d that appears alongside search results.\n\nRegulators may be harder to convince. Amazon\u2019s clout is such that a fee increase of, say, 5 percent wouldn\u2019t lead to a mass migration to eBay or another rival service, said Juozas Kaziuk\u0117nas, chief executive of e-commerce research firm Marketplace Pulse.\n\nThat is key, because judges tend to define a company as dominating a market if its customers would absorb a \u201cnon-cost justified price increase\u201d rather than moving to a rival, said Herb Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\n\nKaziuk\u0117nas believes Amazon\u2019s reach would lead sellers to pass on those costs or eat them.\n\n\u201cThe whole industry is locked into Amazon dominance,\u201d Kaziuk\u0117nas said.", "description": "Many Amazon sellers complain privately that the ecommence giant's ever-increasing power has resulted in a system in which only a few can succeed \u2013 and only through paying up", "authors": ["Jay Greene", "Reporter Focused On Technology Coverage In The Pacific Northwest", "October At Am", "Jay Greene Is A Reporter For The Washington Post Who Is Focused On Technology Coverage In The Pacific Northwest."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4H5LqkeZlolq-BSak1XI3nEM2Iw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KLSWSZGKTYI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
