The survey found more adults responding correctly to questions about constitutional rights and other civics concepts.\n\nThe bad news is that only about 39% of adults can correctly name the three branches of United States government (executive, legislative, and judicial, in case you were wondering). While this is the highest mark in the last five years, it still leaves room for improvement. Nearly a quarter of those surveyed \u2014 about 22% \u2014 couldn\u2019t name a single governmental branch. Still, that\u2019s markedly better than the previous two years when a third of respondents were stumped on the same question.", "description": "", "authors": ["Study Finds", "Studyfinds.Org Civics-Survey-Fifth-Of-Americans-Cant-Name-Single-Branch-Of-Government"], "top_image": ""}
