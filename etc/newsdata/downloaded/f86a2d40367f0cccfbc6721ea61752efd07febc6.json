Roma has big history and I am very happy to be here,\u201d said Mkhitaryan, Armenia\u2019s all time scorer who has arrived after a disappointing 18 months at Arsenal.\n\nMilan, fifth last season, signed Croatia forward Rebic on a two-year loan from Eintracht Frankfurt with Portugal\u2019s Silva moving in the other direction. Rebic, 25, is already at the sixth club of his career.\n\nMeanwhile, Inter said they had loaned Icardi to French champions Paris St Germain for one season with a loan to buy, ending months of uncertainty over his future. His contract with Inter was also extended by two years, to 2022.\n\nIcardi has been Inter\u2019s leading scorer for each of the last five seasons but he has also fallen out with the ultras and his marriage has provided fodder for the gossip columns. Conte had already made it clear that Icardi was not part of his plans.\n\nFiorentina, who narrowly escaped relegation last season and have since been bought by Italian-born U.S. billionaire Rocco Commissio, signed two young forwards, Bobby Duncan, 18 from Liverpool and Pedro, 22, from Brazilian club Fluminense.\n\nTheir previous signings have included veteran Frenchman Franck Ribery, although they have lost their opening two games.\n\nAtalanta, who have qualified for the Champions League for the first time, announced that Skrtel had agreed to leave by mutual consent, one day after coach Gian Piero Gasperini said the Slovakian was struggling with the team\u2019s tactics.\n\n\u201cHe said that at his age, he had trouble playing in a three-man defence which is understandable,\u201d said Gasperini.\n\nAmong the other moves were 35-year-old Matri\u2019s from Sassuolo to promoted Brescia, where he will link up with maverick forward Mario Balotelli.\n\nMatri\u2019s previous 10 clubs included Milan and Juventus, where he had two stints at each, Lazio and Fiorentina.", "description": "AS Roma ended a busy transfer window by signing Nikola Kalinic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan on loan on Monday while Inter Milan offloaded former captain Mauro Icardi to Paris St. Germain after a prolific but turbulent six years at the club.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425524926&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811LF"}
