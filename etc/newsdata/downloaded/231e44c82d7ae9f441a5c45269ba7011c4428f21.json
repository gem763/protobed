The 81-year-old actress was detained on the steps of the US Capitol, handcuffed, and escorted into a police vehicle.\n\nFonda was one of 16 people arrested for unlawfully protesting, and was charged with \"crowding, obstructing or incommoding\". She was released hours later.\n\nThe double Oscar-winner recently moved to Washington to join regular protests after being inspired by 16-year-old Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nBefore the protest, Fonda said: \"I will be on the Capitol every Friday, rain or shine, inspired and emboldened by the incredible movement our youth have created.\n\n\"And we\u2019re going to engage in civil disobedience and we\u2019re going to get arrested every Friday.\" She said her protests over the next 14 Fridays would be called \"Fire Drill Fridays.\n\n\" Fonda was detained while protesting alongside a group called Oil Change International. In a speech before her arrest she called climate change \"a collective crisis that demands collective action now.\"\n\nHer best known films include Klute, Coming Home, and On Golden Pond. She has a long history of activism and, in the 1960s, was one of the main figures of the counterculture movement, and a high-profile opponent of the Vietnam War. In 1972, she went to North Vietnam and was photographed sitting on an anti-aircraft gun, which led to the nickname \"Hanoi Jane.\"", "description": "Jane Fonda has been arrested at a climate change protest in Washington.", "authors": ["Nick Allen", "Charles Moore"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212761214-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
