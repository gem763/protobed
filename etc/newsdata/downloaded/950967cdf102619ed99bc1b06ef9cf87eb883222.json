In some places on the coast, seawater could rise to 7 feet above normal tidal levels.\n\nDorian was moving a bit faster, at 6 miles an hour, toward the northwest, and it was expected to keep up that speed or gain a little more overnight, the center said. Its maximum sustained winds remained steady at 110 miles an hour.\n\nWith the center of the storm about 100 miles east of Vero Beach, Fla., Dorian was whipping Florida on Tuesday afternoon with tropical-storm-force winds, which extend out about 175 miles from the center. A tornado or two near the coast of Florida was possible, the center said. The storm\u2019s stronger hurricane-force winds, which extend about 60 miles from the center, remained some hours away from reaching the mainland but were likely to do so overnight.", "description": "Now a Category 2 storm, Dorian\u2019s winds and rains have begun to  lash the Florida shore, and storm surge warnings are posted all the way to North Carolina. In the pummeled Bahamas, rescue missions were hampered by high winds and seas.", "authors": ["Patricia Mazzei", "Frances Robles", "Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/03/world/03bahamas-5/03bahamas-5-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
