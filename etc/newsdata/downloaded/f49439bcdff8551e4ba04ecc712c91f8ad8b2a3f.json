Rows of two-storey houses are bookended by three-storey flats, each with its own front door and lobby space for bikes and prams, plus a private balcony.\n\nBuilt to exacting German \u201cPassivhaus\u201d standards, each home's energy costs are estimated to be 70 per cent cheaper than for the average household.\n\n\"The houses have to be very highly insulated and airtight,\" says architect Annalie Riches of Mikhail Riches Architects who designed the scheme, \"Really simple things, like you can't have a letter box in a front door.\"\n\nIt's the largest Passivhaus scheme in the UK. Every wall is over 60 centimetres thick, letter boxes are built into external porches, all the homes face south to maximise solar gain and the roofs are angled so that each terrace does not block sunlight to homes in the street behind.\n\nThe prestigious Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Stirling Prize is judged on criteria such as design vision, originality and environmental impact, as well as capacity to engage and delight its occupants. This year's winning project has been more than 10 years in the making, and it places communal spaces and open walkways at its heart.\n\nThe RIBA Stirling Prize 2019 judges, chaired by Julia Barfield, said: \u201cGoldsmith Street is a modest masterpiece.\n\n\"It is high-quality architecture in its purest, most environmentally and socially conscious form.\n\n\"These desirable, spacious, low-energy properties should be the norm for all council housing.\"\n\nCommunal spaces: Goldsmith Street has a focus on shared spaces and walkways (Tim Crocker)\n\nDescribed as a \"beacon of hope\" by RIBA president Alan Jones, the scheme has been modelled on similar Victorian terraces in nearby streets but stands apart for its unrivalled sustainability and clever layout.\n\nCreamy clay bricks are similar to those used in surrounding Victorian properties, while glossy black roof tiles are a nod to the city's Dutch trading links.\n\nDavid Mikhail of Mikhail Riches Architects highlights the social aspect of the scheme: \"We were very keen to ensure that front doors face front doors. [And] to make it less car-orientated, so there are many more places for people just to walk or children to scoot without having to cross a road.\"\n\nJoseph Harrington, a resident of Goldsmith Street, tells the BBC: \"People walk in and they're impressed, as if you built this. I mean, I didn't chose the brickwork or the front door but it's clear that someone has, and someone did care that I liked my home.\n\n\"And that means a lot to me, that someone put in the effort and said, \u2018Let's try something different.\u2019 And it doesn't feel like I rent a house. It feels like I own a house, which is really nice.\"\n\nGoldsmith Street was chosen as the 2019 RIBA Stirling Prize winner from the following shortlisted entries:\n\nLondon Bridge station , by Grimshaw Architects, a \u00a31 billion revamp that includes a 15-platform concourse bigger than the pitch at Wembley and the biggest railway upgrade since Victorian times\n\n, by Grimshaw Architects, a \u00a31 billion revamp that includes a 15-platform concourse bigger than the pitch at Wembley and the biggest railway upgrade since Victorian times Cork House in Berkshire , by MBH Architects, an experimental carbon-neutral home made almost entirely from cork\n\n, by MBH Architects, an experimental carbon-neutral home made almost entirely from cork Nevill Holt Opera in Leicestershire , by Witherford Watson Mann Architects, a new theatre space in a 17th-century stable block that has a mix of period features and modern additions\n\n, by Witherford Watson Mann Architects, a new theatre space in a 17th-century stable block that has a mix of period features and modern additions The Macallan Distillery and Visitor Experience in Moray , by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, a whisky plant with a grass-covered roof made of 2,500 triangles of Scandinavian wood\n\n, by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, a whisky plant with a grass-covered roof made of 2,500 triangles of Scandinavian wood The Weston visitor centre at Yorkshire Sculpture Park, by Feilden Fowles Architects, which has a concrete saw-tooth roof over a new restaurant, gallery space and public foyer\n\nLast year's winner was Bloomberg's European HQ, in Queen Victoria Street near Bank Underground station, which was designed by Lord Foster's architectural practice. Billed as the world's most sustainable office, the Foster + Partners building is also believed to be the biggest stone structure in the City of London.\n\nSpread over an entire city block, the office was commissioned to house all Bloomberg\u2019s London employees under the same roof for the first time. The building incorporates both public and private space, with two sections connected by a bridge sitting on either side of a new public arcade, which re-establishes an ancient Roman road.\n\nThe 2019 prize jury included: chairperson Julia Barfield, whose past projects have included the London Eye; Michael Jones of last year's winning studio Foster + Partners; heritage specialist Kathy Gee MBE and RIBA president Alan Jones.", "description": "A \u201chighly sustainable\u201d council estate in Norwich scooped Britain\u2019s top architecture prize at a ceremony in London this evening.
