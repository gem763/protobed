The former Trump campaign manager\u2019s combative five-hour session before the House Judiciary Committee on Sept. 17 amounted to a massive middle finger to Democrats, who afterward privately panned the hearing as a disaster.\n\nGiven Giuliani\u2019s track record of theatrics and his fierce loyalty to the president, some Democrats worry that his testimony wouldn\u2019t contribute to legitimate fact-finding but rather turn Democrats\u2019 sober-minded mission into a complete circus\u2014as well as slow down an impeachment proceeding that nearly all Democrats believe needs to be completed with the utmost speed.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), a member of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, predicted a Giuliani testimony would be a Lewandowski-like spectacle and simply amplify the partisan takes he brings to cable news nightly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we need to complicate this too much with a madman like Rudy Giuliani in Congress,\u201d said Swalwell. \u201cWhy waste your time?\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Thedailybeast.Com Democrats-Worry-Rudy-Giuliani-Would-Send-Trump-Impeachment-Hearing-Off-The-Rails"], "top_image": ""}
