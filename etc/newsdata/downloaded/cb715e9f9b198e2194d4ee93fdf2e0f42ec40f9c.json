The Land Cruiser name carries high esteem even in the most demanding circles, acquitting itself peerlessly under the harshest conditions around the globe.\n\nWith this revered reputation fused into its mechanical DNA, Toyota South Africa is proud to announce the introduction of a bespoke double-cab derivative, enhanced with application-specific accessories.\n\nBearing the Namib nomenclature, this Land Cruiser 79 takes inspiration from the Namib Desert in Southern Africa \u2013 one of the oldest and largest deserts in the world.\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\n\u201cThe Namib Desert presents some of the most challenging terrain, and surviving in these extreme conditions requires the right preparation and equipment. I am proud to announce that we have created this special Land Cruiser model to offer customers a ready-to-go vehicle prepared and equipped to tackle the most daunting challenges,\u201d says Calvyn Hamman: Senior Vice-President of Sales and Marketing.\n\nEnhanced Exterior\n\nStarting with the exterior, the Land Cruiser Namib projects a robust appearance. The front grille has been changed to a simple mesh design with prominent Toyota lettering (akin to the Hilux GR Sport), leveraging the design of Land Cruiser heritage models. Unique stylised Namib badges can be found on the flanks alongside the Land Cruiser brand mark, as well as the tailgate.\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\nA steel front bumper with integrated heavy-duty nudge bar and headlight protectors, add utility and ruggedness. Large, high-intensity LED spotlights ensure optimum visibility under all conditions.\n\nMoving towards the business end, a tubular rear step with integrated towbar make loading and towing a breeze, whilst protective loadbin skins round off the package.\n\nThe \u2018Namib\u2019 is available in Ivory White and Sand Beige.\n\nInterior Additions\n\nTo combat desert temperatures, the glovebox features an added cooling duct, allowing items to be kept chilled via the vehicle\u2019s air-conditioning system.\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\nThe Land Cruiser Namib package has been designed with the customer and unique-usage situations in mind, therefore the interior has been fitted with bespoke grey canvas seat covers, embroidered with the sand-dune-inspired Namib logo. The edges also feature anti-scuff panels to prevent degrading of the material during ingress.\n\nAn application-specific roof console has been added, enhancing versatility by means of rear-facing LED lights, lined storage binnacle, driver and passenger LED lights, two-way radio compartment and microphone cord hook.\n\nOff-road improvements\n\nThe Land Cruiser Namib has been fitted with an upgraded off-road suspension (manufactured by a respected local off-road suspension expert for Toyota), whilst maintaining the existing payload and towing capacity.\n\nThe tyres have been upgraded to larger 265/75/R16 Cooper Discoverer S/T Maxx versions, complete with white lettering, affixed to durable 16\u201d alloy wheels.\n\nEngine Performance\n\nThe \u2018Namib\u2019 makes use of the revered 1VD-FTV 4.5-litre turbodiesel engine, churning out 151 kW and 430 Nm from a low 1200 rpm (up to 3200 rpm). The Fuel Consumption index is pegged at 11.3 l/100km with CO2 emissions registering 300 g/km.\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\nStandard Specification\n\nThe Namib edition retains all of the standard Land Cruiser 79 D-Cab V8 specification, which include a touchscreen audio system with built-in Navigation, Bluetooth, front power socket, power windows, tilt and telescopic steering column, remote central locking and anti-theft system. The safety systems include driver and passenger airbags alongside an anti-lock braking system (ABS).\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\nWarranty and Service Plan\n\nA 3-year/100 000 km warranty is provided whilst customers can purchase optional service plans according to their needs.\n\nModel Line-up and Pricing\n\nLand Cruiser 79 4.5D V8 D/C Namib \u2013 R 893 600", "description": "With inspiration from one of the largest and oldest Deserts, the Namib, Toyota introduces their all-new Land Cruiser Namib.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7634/56ca71d032d443ef9170aa3329dc69ca.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
