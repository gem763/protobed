The Saudis began shuttling as many as 1,500 troops to the area, according to Yemeni researchers, and training local forces to tackle rampant weapons smuggling through the porous border with Oman.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The Saudis unfurled a further five main bases, some still under construction, and according to locals as many as 20 smaller outposts \u2013 sparking alarm and outrage among the Mahri who accuse the Saudis of a land grab.\n\nThe Saudi authorities have repeatedly defended their actions saying heavy weaponry was being funnelled through the sea route or the notoriously corrupt border with Oman to Houthi rebels who were firing missiles at Saudi Arabia that were reaching as far as Riyadh.\n\nSaudi presence has not just agitated the locals but, according to experts and foreign diplomats, caused a growing rift with neighbouring Oman, another regional powerhouse.\n\nMuscat sees the takeover of its neighbour Mahra, as a domestic threat: many Omanis are Mahri and tribal territory stretches over the border with Yemen.\n\nExperts and locals have warned that Oman, once dubbed the Switzerland of the Middle East for its refusal to take sides in any conflicts, has recently started funnelling support to their own affiliates on the ground. British diplomats in interviews with The Independent also voiced their concern about Muscat\u2019s entry to the complex proxy war.\n\nThe resulting tensions have received little international attention, but could have wide-reaching and potentially devastating consequences for the region if both sides continue to fight for control of the area.\n\n\u201cMahra was isolated and the last stable place in Yemen. But now there is a regional power war brewing and Mahra is the new proxy front line,\u201d said Farea al-Muslimi, head of Yemeni think tank Sanaa Centre for Strategic Studies.\n\nThe think tank\u2019s own researcher, local journalist Yahya Sawari, was arrested on 3 July by Saudi-affiliated forces while attempting to interview anti-Saudi protesters injured during rallies which were attacked.\n\nNeither the centre nor Sawari\u2019s family had any idea where he was being held or on what charges. The Committee to Protect Journalists called for his immediate release.\n\nOn Tuesday, more than 50 days later, a message appeared on Sawari\u2019s Facebook page, where he said he managed to get out but had been tortured into confessing he worked for Qatar or Oman and his brother was still missing.\n\nOne of the dynamics Sawari had been researching was how the Saudi power grab has dragged Oman into the melee.\n\nAccording to al-Muslimi, and conversations The Independent had with Mahri tribesmen, Oman is now actively sending money to forces within Marha to ward off a total take over. Oman has also been accused of encouraging anti-Saudi protest movements there.\n\n\u201cOman was the last neutral neighbour for Yemen. It was not involved in this war but now it is,\u201d he adds.\n\nOfficials within Oman declined interviews or to comment. However many in Muscat believe that the Omani leadership needs to take a stronger stance against Saudi encroachment in Mahra.\n\nDr Abdullah al Ghailani, an Omani strategist, tells The Independent from Muscat that Mahra was \u201cOman\u2019s backyard\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have also developed a lot of infrastructure there, we have strong political ties. Mahra is the buffer zone which remained a peaceful place until the Saudis and UAE put their troops there,\u201d he adds.\n\nIt has also potentially set the Saudis against their regional ally the UAE, who had reportedly tried. and failed. between 2015 and 2017 to build and train a Mahra elite force, ostensibly to fight extremist groups like al-Qaeda as they had done in other governorates including Aden, home to the country\u2019s de-facto capital.\n\nIn the process, the UAE set up a sweep of bases along the southern coastline of the rest of the country.\n\nOxford University professor Elisabeth Kendall, a leading expert on Mahra, says the Saudi\u2019s military footprint in Mahra would \u201cstop the UAE from getting a clean sweep of the south\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf they have their military bases, it is going to mean that the UAE can\u2019t have a separate south, as they won\u2019t get Mahra and Socotra,\u201d\n\nShe points to the fact that the Saudi campaign to stop smuggling hasn\u2019t put a complete halt to the trade.\n\n\u201cCertainly, Saudi went in to tackle smuggling but they don\u2019t look like they are leaving. And while they have tackled the big stuff they have left the smaller stuff,\u201d she adds.\n\nYemen has been ripped apart by a ruinous civil war since the Iran-backed Houthi rebels swept control of the country in early 2015, ousting the recognised president Abed-Rabbou Mansour Hadi.\n\nFearing the encroachment of Iranian influence on its borders, Saudi Arabia and its Sunni allies, including the UAE, launched a devastating bombing campaign in March of the same year to reinstate Mr Hadi.\n\nAs the war dragged on they launched a ground invasion and Abu Dhabi trained up some 90,000 Yemeni troops to battle the Houthis, but also snuff out a growing presence of al-Qaeda and Isis that exploited the security breakdown to expand their territories.\n\nFive years on there is little hope for an end to the crisis, which has left nearly 13 million people on the brink of famine.\n\nAnd now from the ashes of the war, several separate wars are bubbling up, including one for southern independence fuelled in part by the Gulf empowering southern separatist forces.\n\nForces loyal to the Southern Transitional Council this month seized control of Aden, the de-facto capital, ousting the recognised government they are supposed to be allied with.\n\nTheir forces have steadily seized territory further east and are now locked in a bloody battle with the remains of the Gulf coalition in Abyan and Shabwah governorates.\n\nAnd so a bubbling conflict in Mahra, a province dismissed for being over 850km away from the well-worn frontlines, has passed largely under the radar until now.\n\n\u201cThe thing we are worrying about the most is that the Saudi occupation will take more land and become violent,\u201d said Nadra Mohammed, 30, a teacher, who has for a year spearheaded a women\u2019s protest movement against the presence of Saudi forces in Mahra\u2019s capital Ghaydah.\n\nThe women\u2019s rallies are also fighting a recent influx of Salafists fleeing war in other parts of the country, who first appeared after the Saudis set up their main base in the airport.\n\nThe women believe the Salafists have been encouraged by the Saudis to move to Mahra, a province which, although religiously conservative, is vehemently against extremist interpretations of Islam and sees Salafism as a threat to their way of life.\n\nThis is our biggest worry \u2013 if the situation continues there will be a war here Nadra Mohammed 30, protester\n\nNadra, a mother-of-four, said men\u2019s protests, similar to the women\u2019s movement, had been met with force and claimed that at least three people had been arrested and disappeared.\n\n\u201cThis is our biggest worry \u2013 if the situation continues there will be a war here,\u201d she says nervously.\n\nIn November 2018, two people were killed during a protest by local tribesmen, which was attacked by Saudi-backed forces who got into a firefight with locals.\n\nRecently the Saudi coalition in Mahra has begun using Apache helicopters to intimidate protesters \u2013 just the week before The Independent entered Yemen, they had fired warning shots near to Ghaydah city.\n\nThe Saudis and their affiliated forces deny they have shown any violence. They dismiss the protests saying they are orchestrated by disgruntled and corrupt tribesmen who have been pushed from power in the battle against smuggling.\n\nSome critics have accused the protests of being backed by Muscat, an accusation the women vehemently deny.\n\nNadia\u2019s brother Hazem Kudda, 28, claims he was briefly detained by the Saudis authorities in the airport, questioned about his sister\u2019s role in the protests, and urged to sign a document promising not to continue with the rallies.\n\n\u201cThey told me to tell my sister she should stop going to the sit-ins, they finally released me after 10 hours when a tribal sheikh intervened,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe airport is like a village, full of armoured cars and weapons. There will be a conflict between the tribes, if they keep arresting tribal members I think there could be war,\u201d he adds.\n\nOutside of the protest movement, and the overlapping political allegiances, there is a rising sense of anger among regular locals.\n\nAt Mahra\u2019s main hospital, near to a sign reading \u201cno qat and no machine guns\u201d families, completely unprompted, talk of the rise in numbers of \u201cmilitias\u201d and arrests.\n\n\u201cWe are very worried about the situation with this new army from outside,\u201d Abdalla, 40, says referencing the Saudi-trained local forces, many of whom hail from governorates across the country.\n\nHis was visiting an elderly female relative in the hospital\u2019s women\u2019s ward and interrupted a different interview The Independent was conducting to talk.\n\n\u201cWe had been living in peace until recently. They come and arrest people from their houses, apparently accusing them of being agitators or extremists.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels like it might explode at any time because of the tensions. These people have a strong hand, they seem to have the control now,\u201d he adds.\n\nAcross town at one of Mahra\u2019s battered fishing villages, fishermen dressed in scrubby Yemeni izaars or traditional sarongs, complain that they are not permitted to fish around the new Saudi bases.\n\nThey say they have been hounded by the Saudis over allegations they are involved in the lucrative sea smuggling trade, a real problem that has blighted the country, that was already awash with weapons.\n\nSome like Saad Abdulla, 30, said their fishing stores were violently raided, only ratcheting up tensions.\n\n\u201cOur daily earnings have tanked to about three quarters of what we had before because of the zone restrictions,\u201d said Abdulla, a father-of-three whose fishing village is three kilometres east of Ghaydah.\n\n\u201cIf we were smugglers we would have lots of money, we wouldn\u2019t be sitting in a small tub trying to fish,\u201d he added.\n\nDisgruntled former regional officials, who like the governor were sacked in place of the Saudi\u2019s preferred candidates, claim the power grab is part of efforts for Saudis to build an oil pipeline from its territory to the Arabian Sea, an idea which has been floating for decades.\n\nThey say Saudi Arabia is increasingly penned in since May drone attacks on its crude oil pipelines, a crisis in the major waterway the Strait of Hormuz and the Houthis threatening the Bab-al Mandeb Strait on the other side of the peninsula.\n\n\u201cSince the crisis in the Strait of Hormuz, we have noticed the Saudis have bought more weapons and upped control over the border. They have also increased their recruitment of local forces,\u201d says Ahmed Mohammed Qahtan, the former chief of police for Mahra, from Muscat.\n\nHe was among the Yemeni officials who tried to prevent the Saudis from taking over the airport. Pro-Saudi factions accuse him of being corrupt and agitating the protest movement.\n\n\u201cThey want to export oil for these areas via the Arabian Sea to avoid the Strait of Hormuz tensions. The used the pretence of stopping smuggling and terrorism,\u201d he adds.\n\nQahtan, who is largely based in Muscat these days, does not mince his words: \u201cWe wish to get a decision by the UN to order the UAE and Saudi to leave Yemen in 30 days. We would prefer Israel to the people there now.\u201d\n\nHis right-hand man is controversial figure Ali Salem al-Huraizi, who is a former border chief and deputy governor, known by his loyal supporters as \u201cthe general\u201d.\n\nSince the time of toppled President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the tribal leader, who has become a key figure in the anti-Saudi protests, has been dogged by allegations of involvement in smuggling, which he vehemently denies.\n\nHe does however publicly acknowledge the support provided to him by the Omani government.\n\nWe wish to get a decision by the UN to order the UAE and Saudi to leave Yemen in 30 days Ahmed Qahtan, former chief of police in Mahra\n\nHe too believes at the heart of Saudi\u2019s presence in Mahra is oil and strategic territorial land grabs, claiming his tribesmen found engineers guarded by Saudi-backed troops trying to put down markers for a pipeline.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis want to exploit hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil through Arabian Sea ... We have seen them recently putting down markers for a pipeline, we caught them and took their guns,\u201d he added.\n\nWhatever the truth is, the outcome is the same: yet another conflict within Yemen\u2019s already ruinous war.\n\nBack at the bullet-riddled pick-up truck, Salem packs his rifle into the front seat. With an RPG in the back, he is ready to head out.\n\n\u201cThe Saudi and Emirates planted militias here and they will start a civil war and that war has started.\u201d", "description": "The bullet had punched a hole kidney-height through the driver\u2019s side of the pick-up truck.
