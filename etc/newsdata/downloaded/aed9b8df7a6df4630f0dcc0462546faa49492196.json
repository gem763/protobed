Katie Hill Resigns From Congress Amid Claims of Inappropriate Relationships With Staffers", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA) announced Sunday evening that she is resigning from Congress after she was accused of inappropriate sexual relationship with a congressional staffer, and she admitted to having a relationship with a campaign staffer.\n\n\u201cIt is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress,\u201d Hill said in a statement. \u201cThis is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.\n\nThe first allegation against the freshman Democrat came last week, when an article on RedState.com reported that she was in a sexual relationship with her legislative director, Graham Kelly. Hill denied the accusation, saying that it was \u201ccompletely false.\u201d\n\nThe RedState article included intimate photos of Hill, the publication of which she called a crime. The Daily Mail also posted lewd photos of Hill and reported that she has a Nazi-inspired tattoo on her body.\n\nShe threatened to sue the Mail over the images, and her lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter demanding that \u201cyou remove these photos from publication at once.\u201d The lawsuit suggested that the Mail had defamed her by stating that she has the tattoo, which Hill has denied.\n\nShe reported the photos to the U.S. Capitol Police on Tuesday and in her statement on Sunday said she is pursuing \u201call of our available legal options.\u201d\n\nHill, who is in divorce proceedings with her husband of nine years, Kenneth Heslep, claimed that he was behind the accusations and that he \u201cseems determined to try to humiliate me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what needs to happen so that the good people who supported me will no longer be subjected to the pain inflicted by my abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives who seem to happily provide a platform to a monster who is driving a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation,\u201d Hill said in her Sunday statement.\n\nIn a letter to her constituents Wednesday, Hill again denied having a relationship with Kelly but admitted that she was involved in a separate relationship with a member of her campaign staff \u201cduring the final tumultuous years of my abusive marriage.\u201d She apologized for the relationship and said she allowed it to happen against her better judgment.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee launched an investigation into the accusations Wednesday and said if found to be true, they would be a \u201cviolation\u201d of House rules. As part of sexual harassment reforms passed last year, the House voted to prohibit relationships between members and their employees.\n\n\u201cThe committee is aware of public allegations that Representative Katie Hill may have engaged in a sexual relationship with an individual on her congressional staff,\u201d the committee said. \u201cThe committee\u2026 has begun an investigation and will gather additional information regarding the allegations.\u201d\n\nHill won her seat representing northern Los Angeles County just last year and held a senior position on the House Oversight Committee involved with the impeachment inquiry of President Trump.\n\nIn her statement, Hill said that she is now going to use this opportunity to fight \u201cthis type of exploitation that so many women are victims to and which will keep countless women and girls from running for office or entering the public light.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for allowing me to turn my focus to this particular battle right now, and know that I stand with you as we continue to fight for the many important issues that brought me to Congress in the first place,\u201d she said.", "description": "After days of allegations of affairs with staffers, the publication of nude pictures, and a House ethics probe, the freshman California Democrat announced her exit Sunday evening.", "authors": ["Anna Kaplan", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1886,w_3353,x_0,y_416/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572223699/GettyImages-1057007808_jw0r4i", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
