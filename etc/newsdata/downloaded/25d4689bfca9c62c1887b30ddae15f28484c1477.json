If you stick with it, you\u2019ll be charged $4.99 per month.\n\nI suspect a lot of people are going to stay subscribed, because, as it turns out, Apple Arcade is already pretty good. It\u2019s chock-full of great games like Assemble With Care, Card of Darkness, and Grindstone, and more games are being added all the time, like the cool-looking architecture-puzzler Manifold Garden that will be available tomorrow. And you can play all of those Apple Arcade games on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV.\n\nIf Apple keeps bringing great games to the service, that $4.99 monthly fee seems like a pretty good deal to me.", "description": "Apple Arcade, Apple\u2019s game subscription service for the App Store, launched on September 19th with a free trial.
