Since 1998, the preseason top team in the AP Poll has won the national championship only 14.29 percent of the time, according to a study conducted by Brendan Meehan of SportsBetting3.\n\nThe best pick, according to Meehan, is second-ranked Alabama. He notes that the second-ranked team in the preseason poll has won the national championship one-third of the time since 1998. Only three teams ranked atop the preseason poll have won the national title since the study began. Alabama, in 2017, was the last team to start and end the year as the nation\u2019s No. 1.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 team's difficulty closing the deal and the No. 2 team's apparent advantage are most likely due to the poll's inaccurate performance assessment,\u201d Meehan told FOX Business.\n\n\u201cTeams ranked No. 2 or higher have won 47.62 percent of championships since 1998 \u2026 Poll members may be biased towards perennial powerhouses like Alabama, ignoring the potential of other likely contenders. That, and a team ranked No. 2, gets underdog status for the season. With the pressure off, lower-ranked teams can comfortably cruise to victory.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIronically, Alabama is ranked second this year, making the perennial national title contenders an underdog to Clemson.\n\nInterestingly enough, the fifth-ranked team in the preseason poll has won the national championship 14.29 percent of the time during this stretch, the same as the preseason No. 1. Big Ten program Ohio State was ranked fifth in this year\u2019s AP preseason poll.\n\nGeorgia (No. 2) and Oklahoma (No. 4) rounded out the top five of the poll.\n\nOf course, there are always outliers.
