Francis says the tax collected should be ring-fenced for research and development in electric planes \u201cand to improve railway connectivity\u201d.\n\nHigh Speed 2 (HS2), the proposed rail link between London, the Midlands and the north, is expected to reduce domestic air travel \u2013 but its future is in doubt because of cost and time overruns. In addition, the Green Party is campaigning against HS2.\n\nResponsible Travel sells thousands of trips each year, many of them to long-haul destinations.\n\nFrancis said: \u201cThere is still a role for international tourism involving a flight. We advocate staying longer and taking fewer flights.\u201d\n\nNeil Robinson, chair of sustainable aviation at Airlines UK, said; \u201cClimate change is a clear and pressing issue for people, businesses and governments across the world, and we welcome the leadership shown by ministers in legislating for the UK to be net zero by 2050.\n\n\"By investing tens of billions of pounds in new, cleaner aircraft we have already decoupled growth in aviation from growth in emissions, and as a global industry we have a long established plan to halve our emissions by 2050.\u201d\n\nThe mainstream travel industry has been campaigning for many years against APD, with some success: the tax was removed for travellers under 16, and the two highest bands, for very long journeys, were removed.\n\nAviation has historically expanded at a rate of four or five per cent annually.\n\nAccording to a UBS survey earlier this month, one in five passengers say they are flying less than they were a year earlier \u2013 though for British travellers the figure is one in six.\n\nThe UK government says tackling climate change is a key requirement of future growth.", "description": "A travel firm is calling for higher taxes for airline passengers to reduce environmental damage.\u00a0 Responsible Travel says\u00a0Air Passenger Duty (APD) \u2013 the tax on flying from airports in the UK \u2013 should increase sharply, particularly for domestic flights and travel in any class other than basic economy.
