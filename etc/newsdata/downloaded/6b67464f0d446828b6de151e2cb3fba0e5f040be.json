In releasing the transcript of his phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump showed that he had nothing to hide.\n\nContrary to hysterical media reports, there was no \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d There were no demands for an investigation or pressure whatsoever. And Joe Biden was barely given a mention over the course of 30 minutes. In fact, his name came up just once.\n\nGREGG JARRETT: TRUMP DID NOTHING WRONG \u2013 STILL, PELOSI AND HER COLLEAGUES WILL DO ANYTHING TO UNDO 2016\n\nWhat really debunks the Democrats\u2019 and the media\u2019s narrative is what Trump legitimately asked for: help with the ongoing investigation by the attorney general into the corrupt origins of the Russia investigation and Ukraine\u2019s involvement in it.\n\nGiven the Democrats\u2019 obsession with election meddling in 2016, their sudden lack of interest in getting to the bottom of what happened is hypocritical at best. They\u2019ve made it clear that they were never interested in investigating the integrity of our democratic process. They are only interested in baseless investigations of the president.\n\nTwo years later, nothing has changed.\n\nAs we expected, the Democrats\u2019 baseless claims that Trump enlisted Ukraine in his reelection efforts were proven false. The president only mentioned Biden in passing during the phone call.\n\nContrary to hysterical media reports, there was no \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d There were no demands for an investigation or pressure whatsoever.\n\nBiden, on the other hand, was caught on tape bragging about threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless it ired the prosecutor tasked with investigating Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company that paid Hunter Biden $50,000 per month as a board member. Talk about \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d Trump merely noted on the matter in his phone call with Zelensky, \u201cIt sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Department of Justice also found there was no merit to an alleged campaign finance violation during the call. This is unsurprising, given the initial complaint that kicked off the latest media anti-Trump spasm came from a whistleblower with \u201cpolitical bias\u201d represented by a Democratic attorney.\n\nEnlisting foreign nationals to do your dirty work is a page right out of the Democrats\u2019 playbook. Just as the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton paid for disinformation on Trump from Russian sources, it was the Democrats who asked Ukraine for help to \u201csabotage Trump\u201d in 2016.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt is legitimate to want to know exactly how the Russia collusion hoax began, and that is precisely what the president asked for.\n\nTrump has nothing to hide. Do the Democrats?\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY RONNA MCDANIEL", "description": "Contrary to hysterical media reports, there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in Trump's call with the president of Ukraine.
