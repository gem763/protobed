The day after he was elected, I said, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll give him a chance. You never know.\u2019 He is worse than I ever could have imagined. \u2026 This guy should not be president, period.\u201d\n\nDe Niro then went on to talk about the \u201ccrazy world\u201d in which we all live and that if it weren\u2019t for \u201cCNN, MSNBC and some other outlets, The New York Times, The Washington Post\u201d \u2014 America would be in deep trouble on the true news front.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, I think [Trump] is [putting on a performance,] as I think some of these other pundits on Fox are, too, because I can\u2019t believe that they would actually buy into this craziness,\u201d De Niro said.\n\nAnd then Stelter said this: \u201cWhen you say that, folks on Fox come after you.\u201d\n\nAnd then De Niro said this: \u201cF\u2014 \u2018em. F\u2014 \u2018em.\u201d\n\nAnd then Stelter helpfully added this: \u201cThis is cable, so it\u2019s not an FCC violation, but it\u2019s still a Sunday morning.\u201d\n\nRight. It\u2019s still live TV. It\u2019s still a supposed television news segment.\n\nDe Niro\u2019s been equally vulgar in the past. In 2018, at the Tony Awards, he made national headlines by calling out \u201cF\u2014 Trump\u201d while on stage, with the cameras rolling. Censors managed to bleep him then \u2014 but CNN viewers on Sunday weren\u2019t so lucky.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d De Niro said. \u201cBut let me say something. We are at a moment in our lives in this country. This guy is like a gangster. He\u2019s come along and he\u2019s said things and we\u2019ve said over and over again, \u2018This is terrible. This is a terrible situation.\u2019 And this guy just keeps going on and on and on without being stopped.\u201d\n\nWell then, there you have it. Leftist logic. Trump is \u201clike a gangster\u201d who can\u2019t be stopped \u2014 so dropping f-bombs during live national news broadcasts is justified.\n\nThat\u2019s not just poor manners. That\u2019s deranged. That\u2019s a sign of a mental meltdown. Notably: The very same thing of which De Niro is accusing Trump.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
