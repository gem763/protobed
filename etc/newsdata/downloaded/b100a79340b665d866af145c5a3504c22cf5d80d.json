A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen\u2019s civil war in 2015 against the Houthis.\n\nThe military staged a parade with 2,000 troops in the southwestern city of Abha, whose civilian airport has been frequently targeted by Houthi drone and missile strikes. Saudi fighter jets and helicopters buzzed over paratroopers carrying the county\u2019s green and white flag.\n\nIn Jeddah and the capital Riyadh, fighter jets from the air force and an acrobatics team flew in formations. The five-day schedule includes musical concerts, fireworks and light shows, and a Cirque du Soleil performance.\n\n\u201cThe celebrations today are a defeat for (our enemies). The people, the leadership and the army are all united as one,\u201d said Ziad Alyami, a folklore performer from Najran.\n\nAfter the attacks, which the military failed to intercept despite spending billions of dollars on cutting-edge gear, Saudi officials insisted the country was capable of defending itself. The United States, its top ally, is sending troops and expediting the delivery of military equipment to bolster defenses.\n\nAt a street festival in central Riyadh, Saudis said they were unfazed by the assault and hailed this year\u2019s celebrations as a show of resilience.\n\n\u201cThis is a very strong message from us, the Saudi people, to the enemies of Saudi Arabia that we are all together. They will not stop us,\u201d said a woman named Basha\u2019ir.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not scared of anything,\u201d said Hassan Mahjoub Hashem. \u201cThank god we are safe and sound and despite all this we are out here celebrating with our heads held high.\u201d\n\nIn weekly prayers on Friday, state-sanctioned sermons underscored the need for citizens to \u201crally around the wise leadership\u201d of the country, according to state news agency SPA.\n\nSaudi national day marks the unification of the desert kingdom in 1932 by King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, Prince Mohammed\u2019s grandfather.", "description": "Thousands of Saudis flocked to public celebrations across the country on Monday to mark national day, which featured a rare military parade and an air of heightened patriotism following last week's attack on the kingdom's energy industry.", "authors": ["Nael Shyoukhi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433042596&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1QN", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
