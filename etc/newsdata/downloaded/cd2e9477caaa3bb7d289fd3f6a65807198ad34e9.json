But as we saw last night, the Roy kids hardly have their relationship with their mother figured out. Last spotted asking guests at Shiv\u2019s wedding \u201chow long they give it,\u201d prickly matriarch Caroline Collingwood is back in the picture, and she\u2019s as acerbic and unpleasant as ever.\n\nIf food is a metaphor for nurture, the lunch she serves Shiv and Roman \u2014 pigeon with shot and feathers in it \u2014 paints a clear picture of the kind of maternal nourishment the Roy kids can expect to get on a visit to mom\u2019s house. While she has no problem using them as a bargaining chip in her twisted poker-game with Logan, when she\u2019s actually given the opportunity to bond with them \u2014 like when Kenny shows up in a time of need and Roman shows up looking for \u201ceggy-peggs\u201d \u2014 she\u2019s nowhere to be found. We spoke to Dr. Tammy Nelson, a sex therapist, psychologist, and Succession fan, about the Roy matriarch, and the effect she has on the kids\u2019 attachment styles as adults.\n\nLogan is a narcissist, absolutely, but suddenly you wonder, wait a minute, is their mom really the narcissist? Or does she have some borderline personality traits? This is an over-generalization, but it\u2019s very common in a relationship for one person to have narcissistic personality disorder, while the other has borderline personality disorder. So they\u2019re polar opposites, which can be very chaotic.\n\nMy first impression of Caroline was her incredible passive aggressiveness. For example, that deal: She says she\u2019ll take either the $150 million Hamptons house, or $20 million plus every Christmas with the children, though it\u2019s clear she doesn\u2019t care at all about spending time with them. She then manipulates the situation and says, your dad would rather have a big house than spend the holidays with you. This is how the kids have grown up, embroiled in endlessly bitter disputes between their parents. The mother has turned them against their father, and their father has turned them against each other. They\u2019ve been unable to attach to a parent. They\u2019re essentially completely on their own, which is why they have these weird, aggressive relationships with each other. I loved how in the episode before this one, for example, we see the kids waiting backstage before the panel and they\u2019re like little kids just jabbing at each other. In that moment, it\u2019s easy to see that their relationships have been this way since they were little kids. They don\u2019t know how to attach, so they can\u2019t even turn to each other for comfort. And so all their adult relationships are attached, either through sex or through manipulation.\n\nIn this episode we really see where that comes from. Let\u2019s take the meal Caroline prepares for them: pigeon riddled with shot. She\u2019s serving her children food that\u2019s literally dangerous, that could break their teeth. It is the embodiment of that lack of nurture. Later, she tells them she\u2019s going to make them breakfast in the morning. Instead, she abandons them, making it clear that she can\u2019t be there for Kendall. Rather than listen to something he needs to tell her, she flees. I think she probably actually did him a favor, because who knows how she would have used that against him. You can\u2019t imagine her hugging him or comforting him. And yet no matter how old we are, kids will always go back to the empty well over and over, expecting there to be something there.\n\nThen there\u2019s the scene where Kendall goes to visit the parents of the young man he killed. That was so traumatic to watch; the way he goes from this giant life of wealth and spaciousness into the cramped, claustrophobic home of a family who is not wealthy, and who have been destroyed by his actions. He goes back into the memory and the emotions of that night, that until now he had been working hard try and contain. And he didn\u2019t have any place to put them. He was trying to go back to that, to that memory, of grief and guilt and shame, and process it without the support of his father. Logan is sort of torturing him: forcing him back there, to linger in the hallway, to confront the incident but also not allowing him to make amends for what he did. Kendall is forced to stand in the outer hallway, where all he could do was really sit in the pain of what he did. This was another way for his father to control him and remind him that he\u2019s in charge. It was a way to re-traumatize him.\n\nThis is followed by intense neglect from his mother, which really exemplifies how emotionally neglected they\u2019ve all been. They have endured abuse and trauma throughout their lives. They lack attachment to a parental figure, which means they\u2019ve never had any emotional caretaking. This continues to get worse as they\u2019re emotionally manipulated by their parents.\n\nShiv\u2019s relationship with her mom is interesting. She\u2019s able to stand up to her more than Kendall and Roman. She\u2019s a bit more direct, even a bit snarky. That directness indicates some independence. I still don\u2019t quite understand Shiv\u2019s relationship with Tom, but it might have something to do with her need to be in charge, and her refusal to be manipulated. She needs someone who\u2019s not quite as smart as she is, so that she can always know no one will ever manipulate her emotions or be in charge of her emotions and her attachment.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Roman. In the morning, Roman comes bounding into the kitchen, and there\u2019s this moment where the camera focuses on his bare feet. This gave the impression of him as a young child, all eager and enthusiastic, like is mom gonna make us eggs like when we were kids? And once again, he\u2019s disappointed. He continues to get smacked down just like his father smacked him last week.", "description": "Each week we take the Roy family to therapy.
