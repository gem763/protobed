The process he's demanding happens in the Senate trial.\n\nNo defendant participates in an indictment in the way he's suggesting,\" Mr Amash wrote.\n\nDemocrats, who lead the House, have been pressing an investigation into explosive revelations that Mr Trump urged Ukraine to conduct investigations for his own political benefit.\n\nA White House summary of Mr Trump's July call with his Ukrainian counterpart showed the US leader asking for a probe into Joe Biden and son Hunter, who did business with a Ukrainian energy company while his father was US vice-president.\n\nJoe Biden is narrowly leading the race to be the Democrat challenging Mr Trump in 2020. It is against US law for any American to seek help from foreigners in a domestic election.\n\n'DENYING' PROCEDURAL RIGHTS\n\nMr Trump and several Republicans say the call was above board, but recent testimony by witnesses is being seen as particularly damaging.\n\nDemocrats say testimony this week from Washington's top Ukraine envoy shows Mr Trump was withholding almost US$400 million in military aid in a bid to force obedience from Ukraine - an ally battling aggression from US strategic foe Russia.\n\nOn Wednesday, dozens of Republicans stormed the secure deposition room in protest, delaying for five hours the private testimony of a Pentagon official responsible for the department's Ukraine policy.\n\nRepublicans have 47 members on the three House committees conducting the impeachment probe who have full rights to attend depositions and question witnesses.\n\nMr McConnell argued that House Democrats are \"denying their own Republican colleagues basic procedural rights that the minority party was granted throughout previous impeachments.\"\n\nThose include Mr Trump's right to be represented by counsel during all hearings and depositions, and for his counsel to call and cross-examine witnesses, Mr McConnell added.\n\nHe and Mr Graham said the minority party was afforded broad rights during impeachment processes against Richard Nixon in 1973-1974 and Bill Clinton in 1998.\n\nDemocrats counter that in those cases there were extensive investigations prior to the drafting of articles of impeachment, and that lawmakers are currently in that phase now.\n\nThey say they public hearings on impeachment are likely in the coming weeks or months.\n\nLawmakers expect Mr Trump will be impeached by the House.\n\nThe process would then shift to a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds majority is needed to convict a president.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] US Senate Republicans on Thursday introduced a resolution that condemns the ongoing impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, arguing that the process examining the president is illegitimate. .
