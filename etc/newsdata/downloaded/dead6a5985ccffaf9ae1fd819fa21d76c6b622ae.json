In the first promo for Chance\u2019s SNL return, he\u2019s joined by cast member Ego Nwodim and later Kyle Mooney for a short clip in which he gets the opportunity to show off his pumpkin skills \u2014 of both the carving and soup-making variety. Hopefully, things will get a little spookier than this promo when Chance the Rapper\u2019s SNL episode airs this weekend, but with the show\u2019s Joker parody about Oscar the Grouch already out in the world, the bar for creepiness has been set pretty high.\n\nRelated", "description": "\u2019Saturday Night Live\u2019 released the first promo for host and musical guest Chance the Rapper\u2019s episode today, in which he shows off his pumpkin-carving skills.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/23/23-chance-the-rapper-snl.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
