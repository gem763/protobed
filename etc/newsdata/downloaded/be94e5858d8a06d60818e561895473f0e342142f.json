Your favorite Disney animated film from when you were a kid is probably getting remade, already has been or is being written on a developmental whiteboard somewhere deep in the House of Mouse.\n\nTim Burton\u2019s 2010 revamp of \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d kicked off a spate of successful live-action reimaginings \u2013 or ones with realistic computer-generated critters \u2013 for many of the old-school films and some newer hits in Disney\u2019s popular 1990s run. The sequel \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil\" (in theaters now) is the continuation of a twist on the classic \"Sleeping Beauty,\" with Angelina Jolie back as the winged title antiheroine.\n\nThe remakes have proven so financially successful \u2013 this year's version of \"The Lion King\" made $542.8 million, \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d scored $504 million two years ago, while \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d and the recent \u201cAladdin\u201d have all been well north of $300 million \u2013 that there are many more to come.\n\nReview: Angelina Jolie's 'Maleficent 2' is like a dark and magical 'Meet the Fockers'\n\n'Maleficent 2': Angelina Jolie fought to find the perfect Russian Red lips\n\nAngelina Jolie reprises her role as the title winged fairy \u2013 and one-time villainess \u2013 in \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\nAlready on tap: A new \u201cLady and the Tramp\u201d (Nov. 12) premiering on the upcoming Disney+ streaming service; the period piece \u201cMulan\u201d (March 27), which appears to be a non-musical take on the 1998 cartoon, set in China; the prequel \u201cCruella\u201d (May 28, 2021), starring Emma Stone as the young \u201c101 Dalmatians\u201d villainess; and an updated \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d that starts production next year with Halle Bailey as Ariel.\n\nIn honor of the new \u201cMaleficent,\u201d here are all the Disney live-action remakes and their sequels, definitively ranked from worst to best.\n\nJohnny Depp returned as the Mad Hatter in the fantasy sequel \"Alice Through the Looking Glass.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\n15. \u2018Alice Through the Looking Glass\u2019 (2016)\n\nWithout Tim Burton around for the mediocre fantasy follow-up, this is not a movie as much as it is a contest for Johnny Depp (as the Mad Hatter), Helena Bonham Carter (the unhinged Red Queen) and Sacha Baron Cohen (new antagonist Time) to see who gets the title for Most Eccentric Wonderlander. Spoiler alert: The audience is the one who loses.\n\nCruella de Vil (Glenn Close) has some complicated feelings when it comes to dogs in the sequel \"102 Dalmations.\" (Photo: CLIVE COOTE/ DISNEY)\n\n14. \u2018102 Dalmatians\u2019 (2000)\n\nCruella de Vil (Glenn Close) cured of her fur-craziness? Riiiiight. This forgettable sequel has Close\u2019s nutty villainess and not much else, with a story centering on ex-convict Cruella on the straight and narrow until the sounds of Big Ben send her and a French furrier (Gerard Depardieu) on a dog-napping spree to capture 102 Dalmatians for the greatest coat of them all.\n\nA grown-up Christopher Robin (Ewan McGregor) reconnects with his longtime friend Winnie the Pooh in \"Christopher Robin.\" (Photo: LAURIE SPARHAM)\n\n13. \u2018Christopher Robin\u2019 (2018)\n\n\u201cWinnie the Pooh\u201d regulars like Pooh, Eeyore and Tigger come alive in post-World War II England to help their old pal \u2013 and now a family man \u2013 Christopher Robin (Ewan McGregor) get his hopeful groove back. Chaos follows these stuffed animals when they hit civilization, and the movie rights itself into a fluffy, endearing affair after starting as a real downer.\n\n12. \u2018The Jungle Book\u2019 (1994)\n\nBack in the day, the family-friendly adventure hewed closer to the Rudyard Kipling source material than the 1967 cartoon, and that man cub Mowgli (Jason Scott Lee) grows up to be a Tarzan-like dude who runs into the recognizable characters (King Louie, Kaa, Baloo) but also gets into a love triangle with his childhood friend (Lena Headey) and her soldier fianc\u00e9 (Cary Elwes).\n\nRoger (Jeff Daniels) hangs out with his best buddy Pongo in \"101 Dalmatians.\" (Photo: CLIVE COOTE/DISNEY)\n\n11. \u2018101 Dalmatians\u2019 (1996)\n\nCast as the classic Disney madwoman, Glenn Close shredding scenery like a cheap dog toy is again the obvious appeal here as fashion maven Cruella schemes to steal the Dalmatian pups of her employee (Joely Richardson) and her new video-game designing husband (Jeff Daniels). Come for all the doggie high jinks \u2013 thanks to a ton of animatronic animals and a John Hughes screenplay \u2013 and stay for Close getting dunked in a vat of molasses.\n\nMowgli (Neel Sethi) shares a moment with his wolf mom Raksha (voiced by Lupita Nyong'o), one of the many photorealistic animals in Jon Favreau's \"The Jungle Book.' (Photo: DISNEY)\n\n10. \u2018The Jungle Book\u2019 (2016)\n\nA darker turn from the more humorous '67 animated musical, Jon Favreau creates an immersive world of extraordinarily realistic animals and a wolf-raised human boy Mowgli (Neel Sethi). The cast is absurdly good \u2013 Bill Murray as the lazy bear Baloo, Lupita Nyong\u2019o as Mowgli\u2019s adopted canine mom Raksha \u2013 but the film lacks the emotional connection to match its dazzling effects.\n\nYoung Alice (Mia Wasikowska, center) leads the troops, including Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), in \"Alice in Wonderland.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\n9. \u2018Alice in Wonderland\u2019 (2010)\n\nYoung Alice (Mia Wasikowska) runs away from stifling English society to an insane place that Tim Burton was born to realize, with playing-card soldiers and familiar faces (or eyes, as the case may be) of characters like the Cheshire Cat. Sure, the plot\u2019s kind of a mess, but warrior Alice is an empowering turn while Johnny Depp\u2019s Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter\u2019s big-headed Red Queen are splendidly strange.\n\nWill Smith takes over Robin Williams' iconic Genie role in Disney\u2019s live-action \"Aladdin.\" (Photo: DANIEL SMITH)\n\n8. \u2018Aladdin\u2019 (2019)\n\nThe high-profile redo isn\u2019t exactly a whole new world, and Robin Williams\u2019 genius Genie is still the best. That said, Will Smith channels his charismatic Big Willie Style days for a blue-skinned magic man who pops onscreen, but the true highlights are the youngsters: Mena Massoud is solid as the movie\u2019s title street rat, while Naomi Scott really sings as an improved, more impassioned Princess Jasmine.\n\nThe aerialist Colette Marchant (Eva Green) prepares to take flight with the title elephant of Tim Burton's \"Dumbo.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\n7. \u2018Dumbo\u2019 (2019)\n\nOn paper, it\u2019s a weird combo: director Tim Burton\u2019s oddball dark quirkiness and an adorable flying elephant. The filmmaker takes the simplistic story of the 1941 cartoon, adds in a lot more human elements (including Colin Farrell as a World War I vet trying to reconnect with his children) and Burton\u2019s signature aesthetic while keeping a childlike sense of wonder.\n\nYoung Simba (voiced by JD McCrary, right) chats with his dad's loyal majordomo Zazu (John Oliver) in \"The Lion King.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\n6. \u2018The Lion King\u2019 (2019)\n\nWhile Jon Favreau\u2019s update plays it too safe in terms of storytelling \u2013 if you\u2019ve seen the 1994 \u201cLion King,\u201d you\u2019ve seen this one \u2013 it\u2019s hard to argue with how awesome the thing looks. Cutting-edge visual effects create a world of talking photorealistic animals that might as well be a nature documentary, and attention is paid to livening up the humor, with Billy Eichner\u2019s funny, overdramatic meerkat Timon showing up everybody, including Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nPrince Phillip (Harris Dickinson, left) introduces his fiancee Aurora (Elle Fanning) to dad King John (Robert Lindsay) and Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer) in \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\" (Photo: JAAP BUITENDIJK)\n\n5. 'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' (2009)\n\nGuess who's coming to dinner? When adopted daughter Aurora (Elle Fanning) gets engaged, Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) is invited to meet the royal parents (and future in-laws), and a mom fight breaks out between the reformed villain in horns and one seriously evil queen (Michelle Pfeiffer). It's a dark and dazzling sequel that digs into Maleficent's magical origins and lets Jolie and Pfeiffer strut their A-list stuff.\n\nBelle (Emma Watson) is won over by the monstrous Beast (Dan Stevens) in \"Beauty and the Beast.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\n4. \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019 (2017)\n\nBill Condon\u2019s big-budget musical take manages to improve on the 1991 original, the only non-Pixar animated film to nab an Oscar nomination for best picture. Centering on the unlikely romance between provincial girl Belle (Emma Watson) and her monstrous love interest (Dan Stevens), this \u201cBeauty\u201d casts a spell with new show tunes, fleshed-out side players and a visually impressive, surprisingly witty man-beast.\n\nElliot is a computer-generated dragon who's furry rather than scaly in the remake of \"Pete's Dragon.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\n3. \u2018Pete\u2019s Dragon\u2019 (2016)\n\nDirector David Lowery nixes the tunes of its trippy 1977 predecessor and leans hard into the kid-friendly story of a feral boy (Oakes Fegley) and his whimsical and furry dragon BFF who\u2019s at risk of being found out in a Pacific Northwest small town. Robert Redford is the cool grandpa of the project but even he can\u2019t outshine the fuzzy green CGI dragon when he takes flight.\n\nMaleficent (Angelina Jolie) holds court as more than just a villain in the \"Sleeping Beauty\" revamp \"Maleficent.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\n2. \u2018Maleficent\u2019 (2014)\n\nPlayed with venom and vigor by Angelina Jolie, the classic supervillainess gets the \u201cWicked\u201d treatment in the \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d revisit. That infamous snoozing curse she puts on Aurora (Elle Fanning) is born from the bad romance and betrayal that befall the once-heroic, formerly winged title fairy, and \u201cMaleficent\u201d has some interesting things to say about true love and the unreliable nature of storytelling.\n\nLily James wears a spiffy ball gown as the title character of \"Cinderella.\" (Photo: JONATHAN OLLEY/DISNEY)\n\n1. 'Cinderella' (2015)\n\nSo far, Kenneth Branagh is the glass-slippered pinnacle of what Disney can do with its remakes, mainly by pulling back from the over-the-top magic \u2013 though there is still plenty \u2013 and instead focusing like a laser on the dramatic trials and rousing triumphs of its central character. Top-notch casting is the cherry on top, with Lily James as the supremely likable Cinderella, Richard Madden as her down-to-earth prince, Cate Blanchett as the detestable stepmother with her own imperfect backstory, and Helena Bonham Carter as one lovably flighty fairy godmother.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/07/15/every-disney-live-action-remake-definitively-ranked/1728331001/", "description": "Disney has gone all in on remaking animated classics.
