On Friday, the ministry said it would consider \u201ccreative solutions\u201d to the suspended Mount Kumgang tours.BY SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
