It taught me to be comfortable in my own skin again and the joy of life no matter where I am,\" Polomaine said. \"A lot of things are lost when you come into a prison, and the two puppies that I have had, what they\u2019ve given me, is my life back.\"\n\n\"Every person deserves a chance, no matter the mistakes you\u2019ve made,\" she added.\n\nOne woman meets her Angel\n\nThe feelings were mutual for Meyer, who received her service dog, Angel, through Puppies Behind Bars.\n\nAngel was paired with Meyer to help her, since she has suffered from post-traumatic stress.\n\n\"I suffered my first trauma while deployed in Afghanistan in 2002, when I was sexually assaulted by allied soldiers,\" Meyer said in a speech at the Puppies Behind Bars graduation ceremony.\n\n\"By the end of January, I had lost nearly 10 pounds and could only sleep and [was] startled at every noise,\" she said.\n\nThe Air Force provided Meyer with a psychologist who was a contractor specializing in trauma. Meyer says she again was assaulted.\n\n\"He was the first person that I told about my experiences in Afghanistan. He used that information to repeat that sexual assault in the name of treatment,\" Meyer said in her speech.\n\n\"Sexual assault is a crime that is not tolerated in the Air Force,\" the Air Force said in a statement to \"GMA.\" \"When a charge is brought to our attention, we will investigate it promptly and if the allegations are substantiated, we will take the appropriate disciplinary action. In this case, the Air Force is pleased the contracted physician was brought to justice in the civil courts and one of our Airmen is being supported through the Wounded Warrior and Puppies Behind Bars Programs.\"\n\nLaurie White/Puppies Behind Bars\n\n\"As I struggled to breathe every day, these puppy raisers and PBB labored every day to train her, care for her ... and love her,\" Meyer said.\n\n\"I never thought I would be standing in a state correctional facility with a puppy, who was phenomenally trained by inmates, who's now going to be my partner,\" she added.\n\nAs someone who worked as a deputy staff judge advocate in the Air Force Space Command, Meyer\u2019s experience with Puppies Behind Bars changed her perception after working with the inmates.\n\n\"We only saw the negative side of people in the courtroom, and when they would leave the courtroom and go off to prison, that was the end of our involvement with them,\" she said.\n\n\"So now, seeing the other side of it, and seeing these women who are committed to making their lives better within the structure they are given and their willingness to give of themselves to strangers they don't know, is amazing.\"\n\n\"Having a graduation in prison is full-circle for the women here,\" Stoga said.\n\n\"They get applause, which they never get in their lives, and for the 45 minutes or an hour of graduation, they feel and they\u2019re treated like they\u2019re human beings.\"\n\nMeyer looked over at the puppy trainers with tears in her eyes during the graduation ceremony.\n\n\"You'll be in our hearts, and in our puppies, and we will never forget where they came from,\" she said to them.", "description": "First responders and veterans are receiving puppies from a program called Puppies Behind Bars, where inmates train the dogs.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/dog-main-abc-er-190827_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
