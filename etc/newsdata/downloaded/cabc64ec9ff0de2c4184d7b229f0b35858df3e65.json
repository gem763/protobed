(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nInside the Washington Wizards\u2019 practice facility, Tuesday afternoon\u2019s start to training camp focused on the fundamentals \u2014 such as counting to 50.\n\nThe team concluded the action portion of practice with five players on the court, passing the ball around to one another. The purpose of the drill was to reach 50 passes in a seamless display of player and ball movement without a turnover. Not having a defense on the floor helped as players switched off phantom screens, cut hard toward the man with the ball and made quick decisions while teammates on the sideline counted every pass.\n\nEight \u2026 nine \u2026 ten.\n\nThe ball moved with metronome consistency; the guard would penetrate, then kick it out to either wing, and whoever was waiting in the corner would swing the ball back to the top. The poetry kept going.\n\nThirty-three \u2026 thirty-four \u2026 thirty-five.\n\nPoint guard Ish Smith gestured to rookie guard Justin Robinson to come closer to retrieve the ball. Robinson, with eyes shifting toward the paint and the right corner, heaved another pass. The ball never stopped moving.\n\nForty-eight \u2026 forty-nine \u2026 splash.\n\nThe 50th pass went to rookie Garrison Mathews, flashing to the top of the right arc and draining a three-pointer. A big cheer broke out in the gym. A new habit was beginning to take shape.\n\nGoing into the 2019-20 season without point guard John Wall, the Wizards know they must play fast by moving the ball. Over portions of the past two years when Wall missed games because of injuries and physical rehabilitation, the Wizards turned into a better passing team \u2014 instead of relying on the five-time all-star to be their lone playmaker. Last season, Washington developed into one of the top teams in assists in the league (26.3 per game, tied for fifth).\n\nThis year, however, Washington plans to emphasize that personality early and stay reliant on the pass.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d Coach Scott Brooks said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been told, you just pass it to the next man who\u2019s open.\u201d\n\nDuring the opening day of camp, Brooks called for drills that encouraged passing and creativity. Before the 50-pass exercise, three sets of four-man teams played on the court. If Bradley Beal\u2019s white team scored on the blue team on one end of the court, then Beal and teammates would hustle to the other end and try to get a bucket on the red team. But a miss allowed the rebounding team to start downcourt and set up an offense against four defenders.\n\nWhen Brooks demanded \u201cno dribbling,\u201d players had to run the offense by only passing the ball \u2014 all while working to get a shot off with a 14-second shot clock. In one sequence, Beal, running point, surveyed the floor and kept his dribble before crossing the half-court line. He then fired a pass to the wing, which led to rookie Rui Hachimura getting an easy look at the basket off a back cut. Although Hachimura missed, the white team tapped in the offensive rebound and retained possession to set up another no-dribble play on the other end.\n\n\u201cIt builds a culture of moving the ball first and cutting,\u201d center Thomas Bryant said. \u201cA lot of times if you move the ball and you cut, guys are open. One team in particular, the San Antonio Spurs, are fabulous with that, and just doing that little drill translates to the games because everyone\u2019s moving, everyone\u2019s cutting. And when you put that in the plays we\u2019re trying to build in, it builds a disaster for the defensive teams out there.\u201d\n\nEven more troublesome for opposing defenses: the steady improvement in Beal\u2019s playmaking skills.\n\nHis simple but heads-up play during the drill showed patience, dribbling and dissecting the defense before crossing the line. Still, Beal didn\u2019t waste time in figuring out how the play should develop. Though last year Beal made history as the first player in franchise history to average season totals of at least 25 points, five rebounds and five assists, Brooks expects his two-time all-star to reach even higher assist numbers.\n\n\u201cI think Brad can be a six- or seven-assist guy this year,\u201d Brooks said during Monday\u2019s media day. \u201cI think he can even take it to another level on the assist side of the ball.\u201d\n\nBeal would agree.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a goal of mine,\u201d he said of averaging at least six assists this season. \u201cI know I\u2019ll be in a lot more situations to be able to do that. I know I\u2019ll get doubled and trapped a lot this year. . . . I expect that number to go up just because of that. I know it\u2019s still up to me to be able to make the right reads, make the right plays. It\u2019s definitely a goal of mine to get that assist number up, my rebound number up, everything. Just keep getting better every year.\u201d\n\nHall of Famer Rod Thorn hired as senior adviser\n\nThe Wizards announced that longtime NBA fixture and Hall of Famer Rod Thorn will serve as a senior adviser.\n\nThorn, who has a career spanning almost six decades as a player, general manager and executive, will advise General Manager Tommy Sheppard in basketball operations matters. After taking in practice Tuesday, Thorn told reporters he has known Sheppard for many years and described his role as a sounding board.\n\n\u201cThey can bounce different things off me. Having been around so long, I\u2019ve seen most things, I think, and maybe a few of them twice,\u201d the 78-year-old said. \u201cHowever they would like to utilize me is certainly fine with me.\u201d\n\nThorn began his NBA career in 1963 after being drafted by the Baltimore Bullets. He played nine seasons and later went on to work as a GM for several teams, including the Chicago Bulls, for whom he drafted Michael Jordan. Thorn then moved to the league office; he spent 1986 to 2000 as executive vice president of basketball operations. In 2001, Thorn returned to a front office and as GM rebuilt the New Jersey Nets from Eastern Conference doormat to NBA Finals contender.\n\nIn 2018, Thorn, who spent last season as a consultant with the Milwaukee Bucks, was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor.\n\nAfter practice, Thorn shared his early assessment of the Wizards.\n\n\u201cI love the spirit that I see out here,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s the development of our young players around a great player like Bradley Beal.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nIsaiah Thomas had an eventful summer, from Kobe Bryant\u2019s secret camp to a thumb injury\n\nBradley Beal, entering the season without John Wall, dismisses the doubters\n\nThree questions entering Wizards training camp\n\nNew GM Tommy Sheppard seeks players who will follow \u2018The Wizards Way\u2019", "description": "Washington, one of the top teams in assists a year ago, wants to move the ball even more.", "authors": ["Candace Buckner", "National Basketball Association With An Emphasis In Covering The Washington Wizards.", "October At Pm", "Candace Buckner Covers The Washington Wizards.
