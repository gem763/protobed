He plans to address a small group of employees, journalists, local supporters, and residents of a nearby hamlet called Boca Chica Village.\n\nThough SpaceX is hosting the roughly hour-long talk at a remote coastal area about 20 miles east of Brownsville, the closest major city, the company is broadcasting the event live online. You can watch Musk's presentation using the YouTube player below.\n\nRead more: Elon Musk is about to unveil SpaceX's new Mars spaceship prototype in Texas. Here's what we know so far.\n\nThe backdrop for the event will be Starship Mark 1 (Mk 1): a towering stainless-steel prototype of the system that the company finished building on Friday. The ship follows the construction and several launches of a 60-foot-tall prototype, called Starhopper.\n\nStarship Mk 1 weighs about 200 tons (without fuel), stand about 164 feet tall, and it will be powered by three car-sized Raptor rocket engines. Some are even calling the test ship the largest upper-stage rocket ever made \u2014 though it technically needs a giant booster, called Super Heavy, to meet that distinction.\n\nRegardless, Mk 1 may launch more than 12 miles high as soon as October or November, according to Musk,\n\nMusk has been tweeting out new details about Starship weeks ahead of the presentation tonight, including major changes to the vehicle's steerable canards or wings. Kimi Talvitie \u2014 a SpaceX enthusiast, software engineer, and artist \u2014 pooled those details into a 3D model that shows how the spaceship might use those devices to safely guide itself back to Earth, or some day land on and help populate planet Mars.\n\nMusk will likely have more to say than that about the system, though, and the company's vision for using it.\n\nSo tune in to the YouTube livestream starting around 8 p.m. ET.", "description": "SpaceX's new Starship Mk 1 rocket ship is part of a larger effort to create a launch system that'd take dozens of people to Mars at a time.", "authors": ["Dave Mosher"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8d29132e22af0e15465797?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
