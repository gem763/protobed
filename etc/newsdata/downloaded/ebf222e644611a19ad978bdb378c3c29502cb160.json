Delayed satisfaction is tough.\n\nBut some people manage it. While we can be baffled and filled with resentment by their money habits, we can also learn from their saving and spending ways.\n\nIn our weekly series How I Save, we track a person\u2019s spending for a week and take a look at the nitty-gritty of their finances, whether they\u2019re expert savers we can all learn from or those struggling to budget.\n\nAlongside satisfying our nosiness about other people\u2019s cashflow, we\u2019re also hoping How I Save opens up the conversation around money and normalises asking the questions and admitting we don\u2019t know everything. Loads of us struggle with money \u2013 there should be no shame in admitting we don\u2019t fully understand how a mortgage works or how to make a budget sheet in Excel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week we\u2019re following Frida (not her real name), who\u2019s a pretty great example for saving up. She\u2019s a 24-year-old blogger, writer, and consultant with far more saved than most people her age.\n\nHow Frida saves:\n\nIn my savings account right now I have \u00a375,000. I try not to think about it too much because I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll spend it.\n\nI earn around \u00a355,000 a year but being freelance it varies a lot!\n\nI\u2019ve saved this much money by working hard, of course, but also by being extremely lucky with my job. I blogged for four years without earning a penny, back when Instagram first started and when I was still at school, so it\u2019s nice that the work is finally paying. Before it did, I was working as a waiter and hostess in my university holidays, as well as during less busy times at uni. I worked for a year before starting university too so I would have some savings.\n\nI\u2019m saving to be able to move in with my partner \u2013 currently we live over three hours apart but have been together for over four years (two of which have been long distance), so we\u2019re hoping to buy a place together within the next couple of years.\n\nThe main way I save is by spending less. People always talk about earning more, but I was able to save even when I was earning much less, because I try to spend very little (less so now that I\u2019m earning more, but certainly when I was younger).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m also lucky that I\u2019ve not had anyone else to support at home \u2013 I\u2019m sure this would be different if I were to have a family or dependent parents.\n\nIn London saving is easier said than done, but I still have the student mentality when it comes to money. I\u2019m also lucky that my job involves a lot of food at events, so often I can reduce spending on groceries this way.\n\nFrida is able to save money by grabbing free meals at events and eating leftovers (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nI\u2019ve just about got to the point with my job that I will ask for more money if I think I am providing value to a brand/person/publication. For so long I was embarrassed to even bring up the topic of fees, but I can\u2019t imagine there are many other professions where the expectation is that you\u2019ll do things for free, and if you ask for money it\u2019s seen as grabby.\n\nI have a savings account and an ISA as of quite recently because I was fed up of being money illiterate, so I did some research on how best to save for the future. I still have no idea if I\u2019m doing the right thing, but it feels good to have some money going into a deliberate savings account each month. I still don\u2019t really know what an ISA is but I have one and I think that\u2019s good?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sometimes struggle with saving because it\u2019s hard to keep the end goal in sight when it\u2019s so big. Sometimes I\u2019ll want to go on a big holiday, but knowing my end goal is a house, I have a long way to go until I\u2019ll hit that. Obviously it\u2019s all about balance, not living a miserable existence, but there\u2019s plenty of fun to be had in the UK, so I\u2019m trying to enjoy staycations more than travelling abroad.\n\nI\u2019m not a big spender when it comes to frivolous things like new clothes, alcohol and takeaways \u2013 I prefer to just wear what I already own (which is also more sustainable), drink gin I get given as presents and I love cooking, so takeaways are reserved for emergencies and special treats, maybe once a month.\n\nThere are pros and cons to being freelance too. Because I never know when my next work is coming, I\u2019m permanently in \u2018survival mode\u2019 when it comes to spending. I\u2019ve finally got to the point where I have regular consultancy clients and writing work month to month, which helps, but my income is so variable that if I had big monthly expenses I think it would quickly become impossible to save.\n\nAlso as a blogger (probably one of the most hated professions), I don\u2019t know how long my job will be able to earn me what it does now, so I don\u2019t want to be silly with money when social media could crash tomorrow and take the majority of my income with it. I\u2019m slowly moving away from it all, but obviously want to enjoy it while it\u2019s here. Strangely, being freelance therefore makes me a better saver, which I don\u2019t mind, but I also wouldn\u2019t mind a bit more predictability of income.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Frida spends:\n\nMonthly expenses:\n\n\u00a3700 on rent\n\n\u00a380 for bills (water, wifi, gas and electricity, council tax)\n\n\u00a3240 on an editor\n\n\u00a3100 on lashes. This is my most shameful spend but it\u2019s oh so freeing to not have to wear makeup, which is my justification. I realise the makeup savings don\u2019t exactly offset the spending, though\u2026\n\n\u00a33.99 on carbon offsetting\n\n\u00a367 on a Soho House membership (which is also my gym)\n\n\u00a313.39 phone bill\n\n\u00a312 \u2018Who Gives a Crap\u2019 loo paper subscription (eco-friendly and long-lasting. This is for my whole flat and they pay me back for some of it. I foot any small extra cost compared to non-eco loo paper because I know they don\u2019t care if it\u2019s sustainable or not)\n\n\u00a35.99 Netflix\n\n\u00a33 on my bank account (it\u2019s a sustainable bank so there\u2019s a monthly charge for their current account)\n\nA week of spending:\n\nMonday: \u00a36.50 on lunch and a coffee \u2013 a nice caf\u00e9 near me does 50% off on Mondays, so I tend to treat myself (I need it on a Monday!). I always get something I know I couldn\u2019t make at home myself.\n\n\u00a31.50 goes on a Tube journey to a meeting.\n\nI have leftovers and homemade cake for dinner.\n\nTuesday: I walk to work, so no money spent there. I spend \u00a312 on work lunch, then for dinner I have thrown-together ramen (my favourite cheap and warming meal) and more cake.\n\nWednesday: \u00a35 on the Tube to head to various events. I have a lunch meeting so I don\u2019t pay for lunch, then have free dinner at an event. I finish the day with some cake.\n\nThursday: Travelling on the Tube for events and meetings costs \u00a33.90. I also get an oat milk flat white for \u00a33.60.\n\nI have leftovers for brunch. I tend to re-jig the same leftovers for the whole week. So I made chilli-non-carne on Sunday, which I then added more vegetables on Monday and ate with pasta, then ate the remainder on sourdough on Thursday with vegan cheese and hummus.\n\nI have dinner for free at an event.\n\nFriday: \u00a33 goes on a Tube journey for an event, where I get free breakfast.\n\nI spend \u00a337.55 on single train ticket to Somerset. Travel to and from Somerset is one of my biggest recurring expenses, as a return costs around \u00a360 with a railcard, but this is where my partner lives so I\u2019ve bitten the bullet and refuse to take a sixth Megabus.\n\nSaturday: I get a day pass to the gym in Somerset for \u00a36. I don\u2019t bother getting a gym membership outside of London because I visit so sporadically, but I will get around three to four day passes a month.\n\nSunday: Nothing spent. I went on a long run and then lazed around for the rest of the day eating bread. The dream.\n\nHow Frida could save: We spoke to the experts over at money tracking app Cleo to find out how Frida can save better (and what we can learn from her spending). Note: the advice featured is specific to one individual and doesn\u2019t constitute financial advice, especially for a London budget. Well done. Your eco-conscious approach to money has left your bank balance looking green! Main vice: You\u2019ve clocked it yourself but \u00a31,200 a year on lashes is, well, a lot. If you\u2019re not already saving into a pension, this feels like a good move. It\u2019s a good habit to get into, especially when you\u2019re freelance. Where you\u2019re going right: You\u2019re aware of the value you\u2019re providing and aren\u2019t afraid to set fees that reflect that. This is ace. We\u2019d be keen to know how you got over your embarrassment around talking pay (we know this is something that loads of people struggle with). That student money mentality is a winner. Making use of leftovers at mealtimes ups the chances of leftover money at the end of the month. If it\u2019s a regular habit, the day you walk to work each week saves you around \u00a320 a month \u2013 that\u2019s \u00a3240 a year (or two sets of lashes and loo paper for three months). As you mention, ISAs can be really helpful for getting into good saving habits and you don\u2019t have to pay tax on any interest or returns you make. For anyone reading: there are various different kinds of ISA out there, so it\u2019s definitely worth putting in some homework time. Bottom Line: Your money management looks to be as sustainable as lots of your other habits. Good luck with buying that place together!\n\nHow I Save is a weekly series about how people spend and save, out every Thursday.
