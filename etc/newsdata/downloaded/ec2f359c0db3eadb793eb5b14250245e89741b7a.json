Lehtikuva/Emmi Korhonen via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nHELSINKI (Reuters) - The European Central Bank must react strongly when inflation expectations are too low to stop them from getting stuck at unacceptable levels, Finnish policymaker Olli Rehn said on Thursday, defending the bank\u2019s decision to raise stimulus.\n\nThe ECB eased policy further last month to lift growth and inflation, a divisive decision which has sparked an unusual public spat between the majority doves and more conservative policymakers from the north of the euro zone.\n\nRehn, who has long backed outgoing ECB chief Mario Draghi\u2019s policy, argued that if the ECB accepted low inflation, it would constrain its own ability to steer the economy through business cycles.\n\n\u201cWe should take care to avoid the sort of harmful equilibrium that arises from prolonged low inflation and zero interest rates, as this would significantly constrain the capacity for monetary policy to balance the economic cycle,\u201d Rehn said in prepared remarks.\n\n\u201cThis would bring about a lengthy shortfall in economic growth with respect to its potential and hinder efforts to boost employment,\u201d he added.\n\nRelated Coverage Euro zone fiscal stimulus needs to play more substantive role: ECB\n\nThe ECB aims for inflation at just below 2 percent, but it has undershot that target since 2013. Its projections show it has little hope of reaching it for years to come.\n\nMarkets\u2019 inflation outlook EUIL5YF5Y=R initially rose on the September stimulus pledge, but they have now fallen on expectations growth will slow further.\n\nPointing to the experiences of Japan, Rehn argued that once inflation expectations remain too low for too long, they risk becoming permanent, leading to low price growth. That would limit the central bank\u2019s ability to ease policy.", "description": "The European Central Bank must react strongly when inflation expectations are too low to stop them from getting stuck at unacceptable levels, Finnish policymaker Olli Rehn said on Thursday, defending the bank's decision to raise stimulus.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436561004&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920IJ"}
