If the trade war isn\u2019t resolved by that date, the tariffs are expected to hit the U.S. tech sector like a brick wall.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has launched a very public charm campaign on the president\u2019s ego as part of a strategy to delay Apple\u2019s exposure to the tariffs, which could inflate the cost of an iPhone by up to 25 per cent. So far Cook has managed to keep Apple largely out of Trump\u2019s mess, but the mid-December tariffs would hit every Apple product that isn\u2019t exempted.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, reports had indicated that Apple was considering moving its Mac Pro assembly line in Texas to a plant near Shanghai before the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative caved and granted the exemptions last week. The exemption also resolves some awkward political problems for Trump, who has repeatedly bragged about all the Apple jobs he was supposedly bringing back stateside.\n\nCNBC noted that, par for the course, Trump was insisting that Apple pay the tariffs as recently as July:\n\nIn July, Trump signalled in a tweet that he wanted to reject Apple\u2019s applications for the Mac Pro exclusions. Trump tweeted on July 26: \u201cApple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!\u201d \u201cA man I have a lot of liking for and respect is Tim Cook, and we\u2019ll work it out, I think they\u2019re going to announce that they\u2019re going to build a plant in Texas, and if they do that I\u2019m starting to get very happy, ok,\u201d Trump later said.\n\nHowever, Politico noted that Cook \u201cdined privately with the president in August, the second summer in a row he has done so.\u201d Neat! That all sounds very much like the president isn\u2019t picking and choosing who will suffer the most from his trade war based on who has the willpower to sit by nodding politely as he chokes down a rock-hard steak.\n\n\u201cThe Mac Pro is Apple\u2019s most powerful computer ever and we\u2019re proud to be building it in Austin,\u201d Cook said in a statement to CNBC. \u201cWe thank the administration for their support enabling this opportunity.\u201d", "description": "Apple will still be manufacturing Mac Pro computers at its facility in Austin, Texas after winning exemptions from federal tariffs imposed in the course of Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing trade war with China, CNBC reported on Tuesday....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Robb Holland"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/wwtpcb5ocm4aetb4axgs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
