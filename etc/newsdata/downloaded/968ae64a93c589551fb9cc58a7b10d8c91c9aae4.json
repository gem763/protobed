In Tripoli, they set off fireworks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better all the government resign,\u201d said 24-year-old Ali in Beirut.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to go to another election as people already woke up.\u201d\n\nPromised austerity measures are essential if Lebanon is to unlock over $11 billion in economic assistance pledged by international donors last year.\n\nLebanon\u2019s public debt stands at around $86 billion \u2014 more than 150 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 according to the finance ministry.\n\nGrowth has plummeted in recent years, with political deadlock compounded by the impact of eight years of war in neighbouring Syria.", "description": "Protesters gathered in the Lebanese capital Beirut to protest after the resignation of a key Christian party rocked the country.", "authors": ["Breitbart Jerusalem"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/lebanon-protests-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
