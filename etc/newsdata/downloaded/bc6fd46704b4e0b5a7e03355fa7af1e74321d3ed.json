It will also flag potentially deteriorating ocean conditions, something the fishing industry for example will be keen to know about.\n\nThe monitoring of whales from orbit is set therefore to become a powerful tool with which to assess the state of the environment.\n\n\"The technology is getting better all the time,\" said Dr Carlos Olavarr\u00eda from the Centre for Advanced Studies in Arid Zones (CEAZA), La Serena, Chile.\n\n\"In this study, we were using 50cm resolution images, but the satellites now can see 30cm. In the future, we'd like also to be able to analyse the pictures automatically, rather than manually; and I'm sure as more minds are applied to the problem, this will become possible,\" he told BBC News.\n\nWhat happened in the stranding event?\n\nIt's not clear why such a large number of sei whales beached en masse in early 2015. One reason for the uncertainty is that researchers were very late in getting to the scene to run tests to establish the cause.\n\nThat was in part because the stranding occurred in a very thinly populated, and difficult to access, area of central Patagonia called the Gulf of Penas. It has multiple fjords, channels and islands, and the deaths only came to light by accident when an unrelated expedition chanced on the carcasses.\n\nThis was a good month after the event and by then the sei whales had already started to decompose. Nonetheless, a ground team's inquiries led it to the conclusion that the cetaceans had probably been poisoned after consuming toxic algae.\n\nHow did the satellites gauge the event's size?\n\nThe planes and boats that surveyed the Gulf of Penas counted more than 340 dead whales, but the complex geography meant that some bodies almost certainly were missed.\n\n\"The aerial survey was done on a huge scale and was very impressive, but it's possible some of the carcasses got washed back out to sea in storms and simply weren't counted. The 343 number was only ever a best estimate,\" said BAS whale expert Dr Jennifer Jackson.\n\nThe high-resolution satellite imagery allowed scientists to do a count much closer in time to the event itself.\n\nThe researchers used pictures from the WorldView-2 spacecraft which can discern features larger than 50cm across from an altitude of 700km. For a whale that may be 10-15m in length, this produces a good outline of the animal's overall shape, including its distinctive fluke.\n\nThe team examined two archive images of the gulf from mid-March in 2015. In one, they counted slightly fewer whales than in the aerial survey work; but substantially more in the second picture.\n\nImage copyright V.Haussermann Image caption The aerial survey was conducted many weeks after the event actually happened\n\nSo, how useful is satellite observation?\n\nIt's possible to see the big baleen whales, like the sei whale, from orbit, and with the WorldView series of satellites now offering 30cm resolution, the task should become even easier - and for smaller whale species too, not just the baleens.\n\nScientists could monitor any beach in world, but especially those remote coastlines where cetacean strandings are a regular occurrence - in places such as Tasmania, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands, and obviously South American Patagonia.\n\nBut it would be even easier if an automated detection system could be developed. The team tried this by training a computer to look for the spectral (light) signature of a dead whale in the Gulf of Penas (the seis turned pink and orange as they decomposed).\n\nHowever, this approach was less successful than manual inspection of the pictures. The algorithms, though, are bound to improve.\n\n\"There are many more satellites planned to be launched with 50cm and 30cm resolution, so if we could automate the system it might be able to find these stranding events almost as they happen,\" BAS remote sensing specialist Peter Fretwell told BBC News.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zoom in to the Gulf of Penas (satellite image \u00a92019 Maxar Technologies)\n\nHow will whales benefit from this science?\n\nGetting to the scene of a stranding quickly will give greater certainty to the cause of an event. Sei whales have continued to wash up in the Gulf of Penas every year since 2015 and so it's vital scientists understand fully what's happening off-shore.\n\nStrandings more widely can be useful markers of the status of a population. The dissection of washed-up bodies (a necropsy) will be an opportunity to investigate the general health of animals, and to study aspects of their behaviour such as their dietary habits.\n\nEven just the pattern of strandings will provide information on which whales are present in an area and their likely numbers. All this detail is facilitated by a more rapid response.\n\n\"It's important ecologically,\" commented Andrew Baillie, the Cetacean Strandings Officer at London's Natural History Museum.\n\n\"[Whales] are often top predators and they are very involved in the marine ecosystem. If they are suffering because of any actions of humans then we need to monitor that and mitigate it if possible.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "description": "Scientists are developing the techniques to spot mass stranding events from orbit.", "authors": ["Jonathan Amos", "Bbc Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rbytz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
