The Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia was one of many sites involved in the clinical trials of Palforzia, which is made by the biopharmaceutical company Aimmune Therapeutics.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t let them go home and eat a bag of peanuts, but it lets them go out to an ice cream parlor and have an ice cream and let them worry less,\u201d Dr. Spergel said, adding it will lessen the burden of fear of exposure and improve the quality of life for patients.\n\nIn clinical trials, participants started with 0.5 mg (about the size of a grain of salt) of the oral treatment and gradually increased their dosage to 300 mg (equal to one peanut) over six months.\n\nIn one double-blind, placebo-controlled food trial that included 555 patients, most of them between 4 to 17 years old, the peanut allergen powder treatment proved 63% more effective than the placebo.\n\nThe study included an initial dose escalation more than one to two days under clinical observation, an increase in dosing every two weeks and maintenance dosing of 300 mg of Palforzia daily.\n\nThe goal of the study was for patients to reach a tolerance of about two peanuts with mild symptoms, a measure about two-thirds of patients met after six months of gradual escalated dosage, Dr. Spergel said.\n\nLisa Gable, CEO of Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE), called food allergies a growing epidemic and said that those affected have no choice but to try to avoid the food and to carry around an EpiPen for emergencies.\n\n\u201cRight now, there are no choices for the patient,\u201d Ms. Gable said. \u201cWe are at a point where the quality of life for these individuals and the risks, particularly for children and youth and young adults, is so extreme for the disease that we are pleased to see the first therapy moving into the market and hope that that gets others to invest in this space.\u201d\n\nShe commented on the daily burden of having life-threatening food allergies, noting how those affected might not be able to board planes and have to worry about social interactions or eating out. \u201cThis disease can be so limiting for so many people,\u201d she said.\n\nOut of the 32 million people in the U.S. with food allergies, 25% are allergic to peanuts, according to Ms. Gable. About 1 in 13 children, or roughly two kids per classroom, have a food allergy, reports FARE.\n\nThe rise in food allergies started in 1998, Ms. Gable said, noting that a reason behind the rise is that doctors were telling pregnant people to avoid eating allergens and delay feeding kids these allergens until later in childhood.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
