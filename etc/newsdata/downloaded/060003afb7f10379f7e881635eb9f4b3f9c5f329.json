On Sunday, he\u2019ll face Russian Daniil Medvedev, who had a similarly easy time dispensing with Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria, 7-6(5), 6-4, 6-3. A victory would give Nadal his 19th career major title, one shy of Roger Federer\u2019s mark of 20.\n\n\u201cOf course, I would love to be the one who achieves the most grand slams,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t spend all day frustrated or thinking about what your neighbor has.\u201d\n\nThe final will pit one of the perennial favorites at Arthur Ashe Stadium against its new favorite heel. Medvedev, a 23-year-old ranked fifth in the world, has embraced the role of antagonist over the past two weeks.\n\nIt will be a contrast in experience as much as in personas. Medvedev will appear in his first career Grand Slam final. For Nadal, it will be the 27th of his career, his fifth at a U.S. Open and his third of this year alone. Nadal won the French Open and finished runner-up at the Australian Open.\n\nBerrettini, 23 years old and the 25th-ranked player in the world, gave Nadal a scare in the first set. After neither player broke serve, he went up 4-0 in the tiebreaker. But after Nadal rallied to cut the deficit to 6-5, Berrettini lost the next three points\u2014and as a result, the set\u2014on three consecutive unforced errors.\n\nIt was a stirring turn of events that turned a potential upset in the making into a predictable outcome. After the two played to a 3-3 tie in the second set, Nadal finally broke serve for the first time.\n\n\u201cAfter that, the match completely changed,\u201d he said. \u201cI started to play with more calm.\u201d He won nine of the last 11 games.\n\nNadal has won the U.S. Open three times, most recently in 2017, when he beat Kevin Anderson. That final was a clear mismatch, with Anderson coming into the tournament as the No. 32 seed. Medvedev represents a far more legitimate challenge.\n\nDaniil Medvedev is 20-2 on hardcourts this summer and has reached the finals in four consecutive tournaments.

But after taking the first set to a tiebreaker, Dimitrov gave Medvedev little cause for concern.\n\nWhat Medvedev\u2019s gangly swing lacks in aesthetic quality, it makes up for in effectiveness. At 6-foot-6, he covers much of the court with a wingspan that makes it hard for opponents to get the ball past him.\n\nSo it went for Dimitrov. It was Medvedev\u2019s first straight-set victory since the first round of the tournament, and it continued what has been a summer of dominance.\n\nMedvedev is 20-2 on hardcourts this summer and has reached the finals in four consecutive tournaments. He won the Western and Southern Open in Mason, Ohio, lost to Nadal in the final at the Rogers Cup in Montreal and finished second at the Citi Open in Washington.\n\nOn Sunday, he\u2019ll become only the second Russian and the first since Marat Safin in 2000 to appear in the U.S. Open men\u2019s final.\n\n\u201cWhen I was going to U.S.A., I didn\u2019t know it was going to be that good,\u201d Medvedev cracked during his on-court interview. \u201cI have to say, I love the U.S.A.\u201d\n\nThe mostly drama-free evening represented a change of pace for Medvedev. He overcame cramps in his second-round match, angered fans by holding up his middle finger in the third round and invited the crowd to boo him in the fourth round. He was jeered lustily during the quarterfinals.\n\nBut by the end of Friday\u2019s match, the fans seemed to appreciate what Medvedev\u2019s antics had largely overshadowed: his sheer talent. He received a warm ovation as he walked off the court. He tapped his racket as if clapping in response, with no apparent sarcasm. Afterward, he spoke of Nadal in reverential terms.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a machine, a beast on the court,\u201d Medvedev said. \u201cTo play him in your first Grand Slam final should be, I want to say, a funny thing. It\u2019s not going to be a funny thing, but it\u2019s going to be an amazing thing to live.\u201d\n\nWrite to BRIAN COSTA at brian.costa@wsj.com", "description": "Rafael Nadal needs one more win to put himself within one major title of the all-time record.
