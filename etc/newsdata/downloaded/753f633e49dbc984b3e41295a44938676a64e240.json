One group asked for a judicial misconduct investigation, and some activists have said the hug took the focus off justified anger at a police killing.\n\nJean\u2019s death drew widespread attention because of the strange circumstances and because it was one in a string of shootings of unarmed black men by white police officers.\n\nGuyger, 31, had just worked a long shift and was still in her uniform when she entered Jean\u2019s apartment and shot the 26-year-old accountant, who grew up in the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia. She testified that she had mistaken his fourth-floor apartment for her own, which was directly underneath his, and that she thought he was an intruder.\n\nAfter Guyger was sentenced and the jury left the courtroom, Jean\u2019s brother, Brandt Jean, was allowed to address Guyger directly from the witness stand. He told her he forgave her and then the two shared a tearful embrace. Soon after that, Kemp walked over to the defense table to speak with Guyger, who she said went through a \u201cmarked change\u201d after the verdict.\n\nKemp said that Guyger asked twice if she could hug her as well and, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, the judge wrapped her arms around the former police officer.\n\n\u201cFollowing my own convictions, I could not refuse that woman a hug. I would not,\u201d said Kemp, who is black. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t understand the anger. And I guess I could say if you profess religious beliefs and you are going to follow them, I would hope that they not be situational and limited to one race only.\u201d", "description": "Amber Guyger says she mistook neighbor Botham Jean\u2019s apartment for her own and fatally shot him in his living room\u2014Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS803_guyger_ZG_20191007151619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
