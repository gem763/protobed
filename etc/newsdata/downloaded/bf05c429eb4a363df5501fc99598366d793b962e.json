No United shares are actually up for sale.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhat is shelf registration?\n\nShelf registration allows companies to register new stock offerings without immediately putting them up for sale. Companies may do this in order to generate interest in their assets while waiting for more favourable market conditions to arrive.\n\nBaty said that United have submitted shelf registrations since 2012. By filing these documents, the company is indicating that they could \u2013 but no means will \u2013 sell these shares in the club at a later date.\n\nAs Baty stressed at the end of Tuesday\u2019s call: \u201cPlease also note that these filings do not indicate that any shares are actually being sold.\u201d The Glazer family last sold United shares in 2017, returning around \u00a356m.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A 6.2% slip was the stock\u2019s biggest fall in a single day for eight months, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThis was due to projections that the club\u2019s revenues would decline this year. Failure to qualify for the Champions League means United predict their annual income to be between \u00a3560m and \u00a3580m for the 2019-20 season.\n\nReturning to the Champions League next season is vital for United. A second consecutive year outside of Europe\u2019s top club competition would, for example, see their lucrative \u00a375m-a-year contract with kit suppliers Adidas reduced by 30%.\n\nDoes any of this affect Solskjaer?\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s side currently sit eighth in the Premier League table, having taken eight points from their first six games. Sunday\u2019s 2-0 defeat to West Ham was United\u2019s second of the new season.\n\nSolskjaer is certain to come under pressure \u2013 externally, at least \u2013 if United appear as though they will miss out on a Champions League place for the second year running.\n\nBut Ed Woodward, United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, said on Tuesday that Solskjaer would be given time to rebuild the club and that everyone at Old Trafford was focused on success on the pitch.\n\nWoodward highlighted recent investment in the academy, recruitment department and training ground facilities. \u201cThese investments, together with the commitment we made to Ole and his coaching staff in March has given us the building blocks for success,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile we are confident this investment will deliver results, it is important we are patient while Ole and his team build for the future. We will continue to focus on the long-term strategy and won\u2019t be influenced by short-term distractions.\u201d", "description": "Following the announcement of Manchester United\u2019s\u00a0latest financial results on Tuesday, it was widely suggested that the Glazer family were looking to sell more of their shares in the club.", "authors": ["Mark Critchley"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/11/glazer-family.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
