That ban was part of a broader 1994 crime bill that, many progressives believe, led to the mass incarceration of young men of color.\n\nSen.

Cory Booker of New Jersey, who has been among those working to reverse the trend of mass incarceration fostered by that bill, and by other developments, took credit for \u201cthe only major bipartisan bill to pass under this president, for criminal justice reform.\u201d That bill, called the First Step Act, eased sentencing guidelines and shortened prison terms for federal inmates. Booker worked on the bill with Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and many other legislators and outside groups.\n\nSeeking to highlight her foreign policy expertise, Sen. Kamala Harris of California said she was \u201cthe only person on this stage\u201d to serve on \u201cthe Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Homeland Security Committee.\u201d It was Harris\u2019s tough performance during intelligence hearings in the early days of the Trump presidency that first launched talk of a 2020 presidential bid by the junior senator from the Golden State.\n\nSen.

No other current presidential candidate sits on the Homeland Security Committee.\n\nIt fell to ABC moderator David Muir to point out that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg was \u201cthe only veteran on this stage.\u201d Buttigieg served in a naval intelligence unit that has been popular among the politically ambitious as a way to gain military experience. Buttigieg said that \u201cas a military officer,\u201d he strove to not let down \u201csomebody that you are responsible for in uniform.\u201d The exchange allowed Buttigieg to distinguish himself as an expert in foreign policy, even as he continues to face criticism that South Bend\u2019s city hall is insufficient preparation for the White House.\n\nBernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, similarly tried to reassure voters that he has the foreign policy experience necessary to run the nation: His singular focus on income inequality has left questions unanswered about how he would deal with foreign adversaries like China and Russia.\n\n\u201cI am the only person up here to have voted against all three of Trump's military budgets,\u201d he said at one point during the lengthy debate, as both candidates and viewers seemed to be battling exhaustion.\n\nSeeking to highlight her own modest upbringing \u2014 and to definitively distinguish herself from Sanders, with whom she shares many ideas \u2014 Warren hearkened back to a time before she was a Harvard professor or U.S. senator.", "description": "It was a night of \u201conlys\u201d in Texas, as the 10 Democratic candidates on the debate stage tried to make the case that they were singularly prepared to take on Donald Trump in next year\u2019s presidential election.
