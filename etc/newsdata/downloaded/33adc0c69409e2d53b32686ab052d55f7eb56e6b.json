The men reportedly tried to use a wasp killer to get rid of it. When that didn\u2019t work, one allegedly poured gasoline on it, and lit it on fire.\n\nThe result, according to a federal indictment unsealed this week, was an August wildfire that raged across the eastern half of the ancient forest, setting 3,300 acres of public land ablaze and costing $4.5m to fight.\n\nKnown as the Maple Fire, the smoke from the blaze also served to exacerbate an already bad summer for the region\u2019s air quality. There were fires raging in Canada and Eastern Washington, and as smoke from these blazes struck Seattle, at some points the city reportedly had the worst air quality in the world.\n\nJustin Andrew Wilke and Shawn Edward Williams have been charged with multiple federal felonies related to timber theft and could face years in prison and thousands of dollars in fines if convicted.\n\nThe bigleaf maple\u2019s wood was covered in a distinct pattern, which if harvested is extremely popular for woodworking and potentially worth thousands of dollars. Before the fire, the pair had allegedly spent months illegally harvesting these high-value maple trees and selling the wood, which is used to make furniture and musical instruments.\n\nWilke was also specifically charged with \u201csetting timber afire\u201d and \u201cusing fire in furtherance of a felony\u201d \u2013 the latter comes with a mandatory 10-year sentence, according to Seth Wilkinson, the lead prosecutor on the case.\n\n\u201cTimber theft, which involves destruction of a public resource, is in itself a really serious crime in this area,\u201d said Wilkinson. \u201cBut this one is magnified many many times because of the consequences here, which involved the destruction of thousands of acres of national forest.\u201d\n\nThe upper portions of the winding Elwha River in the Olympic National Park south-west of Port Angeles, Washington.

Williams was arrested a couple weeks ago and is in state custody in California, but is expected to be transferred to Washington for his arraignment.\n\nWilke\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and court records did not name a federal attorney for Williams.\n\nTree theft has become a problem for the Olympic forest and other national forests across the country, said Susan Garner, spokesperson for the Olympic National Forest.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t have enough law enforcement officers out there, and many of our roads are remote,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem, I think, probably on every national forest.\u201d\n\nTree theft may be costing the US. Forest Service up to $100m each year, according to a High Country News article published in 2017. Western Washington has been one of the areas most impacted.\n\nThe indictment states that Wilke and Williams, along with other unnamed individuals, spent the spring and summer on the hunt across the Pacific Northwest forest for maple trees. When they found a good candidate, the small team allegedly used a chainsaw to fell the tree, and later cut it into smaller pieces.\n\nWith the right permits, most national forests allow visitors to harvest trees for personal use. But Wilke and Williams were allegedly selling the blocks to a lumber mill in a small city in western Washington by presenting its owner with permits saying it had been harvested on private land, according to a news release from the US attorney\u2019s office. By the time they found the maple in early August, they had allegedly sold thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of wood to the mill.", "description": "Tree theft, which led to the deadly Maple Fire in Washington, may be costing the US Forest Service up to $100m each yearHall of Mosses Trail at Olympic National Park in Washington.
