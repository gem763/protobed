This clearly wasn\u2019t something the audience were expecting: No Fun, yes; I Wanna Be Your Dog, of course; an easy listening ballad made famous by Johnny Mathis and subsequently covered by Engelbert Humperdinck, not so much. But it wasn\u2019t an isolated incident: throughout the Stooges\u2019 career, Pop showed a propensity for launching into The Shadow of Your Smile at unlikely moments. He sang it in 1972, for CBS Records boss Clive Davis, in the hope of convincing him to sign the Stooges at a point in their career when the band had been written off as a joke: a move that paid off. Later that year, he sang it during the Stooges\u2019 mythic performance at London\u2019s Scala cinema, to an audience who were largely bemused or horrified by what was happening on stage. There are muddy bootleg recordings of him singing it at whatever godforsaken venues the Stooges were reduced to playing in 1974, during the original band\u2019s harrowing terminal phase. Pop, it seems, has always been keen to demonstrate that, amid the chaos and bloodshed and visceral rock\u2019n\u2019roll on which his reputation is based, he\u2019s a man of many, perhaps improbable, parts.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iggy Pop: Free album art work\n\nThis is worth remembering when trying to make sense of his recent solo releases. The Stooges\u2019 re-formation \u2013 and their failure to translate the force of their live shows into a potent studio album \u2013 seemed to have largely rid him of the desire to make loud, aggressive rock music. Supposedly his last album, 2016\u2019s Post Pop Depression instead looked to the arty angularity of his 70s Bowie collaborations for inspiration. Elsewhere, the Pop of The Shadow of Your Smile has been very much in evidence: 2009\u2019s Pr\u00e9liminaires saw him crooning Autumn Leaves and flirting with trad jazz; 2012\u2019s Apr\u00e8s featured the mind-blowing sound of Pop essaying the Beatles\u2019 Michelle.\n\nBut perhaps not even that could prepare you for Free, on which Pop collaborates with jazz trumpeter Leron Thomas and shoegaze-inspired guitarist Noveller, recites poetry \u2013 by Lou Reed and Dylan Thomas \u2013 over new-agey piano and ambient synth textures and occasionally sounds less like one of rock history\u2019s greatest frontmen than a special guest, a man with a cameo role on his own album. His contribution to the title track consists of him saying \u201cI wanna be free\u201d, twice. The nearest comparison from his back catalogue might be the spoken-word-heavy Avenue B, unveiled to minimal sales and critical raspberries 20 years ago. But even the ardent Pop-timist who\u2019s sat through that might find that certain moments on Free cause them to hit the panic button, not least when Pop augments his The Shadow of Your Smile baritone with a pub-singer vibrato so pronounced and arch that, at one point during Page, it causes him to stretch the word \u201call\u201d out over nine syllables.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iggy Pop: James Bond \u2013 video\n\nThere are undoubtedly moments where the collaboration sparks. Love\u2019s Missing is taut, gripping and not unlike the Pixies, had the Pixies opted to expand their lineup with a jazz trumpeter. Sonali, by contrast, sounds like something from the early 80s: wafty electronics, ringing guitar harmonics, surprisingly rapid-fire drumming. It\u2019s a curious place for Iggy Pop to fetch up, but, as we\u2019ve already established, a certain expectation-confounding streak has always been in evidence.\n\nSonali also features the sound of Pop audibly struggling to fit the lyrics to the music. In fact, lyrics are a bit of a problem throughout. Pop has been keen to point out that Thomas and Noveller wrote the album, and it\u2019s tempting to say you can see why. There\u2019s clearly nothing wrong with Dylan Thomas\u2019s Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night or indeed Lou Reed\u2019s We Are the People, which hails from 1970, but sounds like an excoriation of Trump\u2019s America. Occasionally, however, Pop seems to have accepted the challenge to sing something even more embarrassing than the lyrics of DD\u2019s, the re-formed Stooges\u2019 2013 paean to large breasts. On Dirty Sanchez, someone has had the brainwave of using breasts and penises as a metaphor for the inequities of capitalism: \u201cJust because I like big tits doesn\u2019t mean I like big dicks, rich man make it stop \u2013 we don\u2019t all want the cock\u201d.\n\nSign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras Read more\n\nIt all ends after barely 30 minutes with The Dawn: more dramatic ambient tones, more spoken word, this time delivered in a menacing growl. \u201cTo lay down is to just give up,\u201d Pop says, which perhaps offers some explanation for the preceding half-hour of poetry, weird vocal experiments, excruciating lyrics and occasional flashes of inspiration. Around the time of Post Pop Depression, he started talking of retiring: the ensuing documentary, American Valhalla, didn\u2019t shy away from showing the physical toll being Iggy Pop on stage takes on a septuagenarian. Like adding vocals to Underworld\u2019s music on last year\u2019s EP Teatime Dub Encounters, Free offers him a way to continue, to demonstrate that he\u2019s still a man of many, perhaps improbable, parts without unduly exerting himself. You can\u2019t really blame him, although you do wish he\u2019d exerted himself a little when it came to quality control: it\u2019s an experiment that only fitfully works, that makes you eager for his next album largely because this really doesn\u2019t feel like the right way for Iggy Pop to bow out.\n\nThis week Alexis listened to\n\nJay Som: Crown\n\nHazy but expansive alt-rock from Los Angeles one-woman band Melina Mae Duterte, perfectly timed for the end of summer.", "description": "This strange patchwork of jazz, poetry, ambience, lamentable lyrics and the odd pub-singer moment works fitfully at best", "authors": ["Alexis Petridis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cdb5a17af8ebc36707353571d582e2f9db31640/0_690_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3e58c1d20d6eaff9760ff18928b605e4", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
