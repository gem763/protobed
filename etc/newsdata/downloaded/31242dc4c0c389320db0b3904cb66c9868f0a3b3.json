That is a known fact.\n\nAt 26, he has appeared in the \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d franchise and Broadway shows \u201cThe Book of Mormon\u201d and \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d in the latter taking home a 2017 Tony award for his physical and emotional performance of an anxiety-ridden teenager facing a school tragedy.\n\nClearly, Platt can also act, which is probably why he was cast as the absurdly ambitious, slightly maniacal, disgustingly wealthy Payton Hobart in Ryan Murphy\u2019s first project with Netflix, \u201cThe Politician.\u201d The eight-episode show, which started streaming Friday, follows Payton as he tries to ruthlessly crush his competition and win the election for student body president at his prestigious high school in Santa Barbara, California. It is a goal that, in his mind, would bring him one step closer to his end game: becoming U.S.president.\n\nThe character is funny and aggravating, lovable yet entirely cringe-y. It\u2019s a juicy role that, on paper, could throw Platt\u2019s \u201cnervous and mild-mannered\u201d Evan Hansen persona out the window. Platt told The New York Times that Murphy pitched the character to him in that way, telling him, \u201cI want you to turn that on its head and play someone who\u2019s more egomaniacal and confident and self-serving, and has a bit more sex to him.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too bad then that the usually innovative Murphy failed to truly switch things up for Platt. The series, which critics are calling \u201cirritating,\u201d \u201cerratic\u201d and \u201cscattered,\u201d is a political reimagining of his groundbreaking series \u201cGlee\u201d; \u201ca teen \u2018House of Cards.\u2019\u201d\n\nInstead of giving Platt the on-screen reinvention he deserves, Murphy fell for the ultimate temptation. He gave Payton Hobart a Ben Platt moment; he asked him to sing. Throughout the first season of \u201cThe Politician,\u201d Platt performs in scenes that perhaps prove this was just going to be another vehicle to showcase his award-winning vocal talents.\n\nCourtesy of NETFLIX Ben Platt as Payton Hobart in \"The Politician.\"\n\nPayton is Lea Michele\u2019s show-offish Rachel Berry, if she were entirely focused on making it to the White House rather than Broadway. He is relentless in his pursuit to get into Harvard University, earning high test scores and carefully calculating his choice of extracurriculars (Model United Nations, working at a literary magazine) to ensure his application is flawless. He even studies Mandarin, for goodness sake.\n\nSomething Payton never boasts about, however, is his interest in musical theater. Actually, it isn\u2019t until he breaks out into a goosebump-inducing rendition of Joni Mitchell\u2019s \u201cRiver\u201d at a memorial service for a character named River (David Corenswet) toward the tail end of the pilot episode that we even know Payton can carry a tune \u2014 and a damn good one at that.\n\nUp until that performance, viewers witness an unhinged Payton battle his tough opponents, his doofus twin brothers, his bisexuality. It\u2019s captivating to watch a character so neurotic in his pursuit for hierarchical acceptance. But instead of focusing on that side of the character, Murphy once again embraced his own adoration of musical moments to the detriment of the plot.\n\nTake, for instance, Episode 6 of the series, \u201cThe Assassination of Payton Hobart,\u201d in which Payton decides he wants to \u201cenjoy\u201d the last few months of school amid his post-election depression. He figures auditioning for the school musical, Stephen Sondheim\u2019s \u201cAssassins,\u201d would be a great way to loosen up a bit after his mother (Gwyneth Paltrow) recommends he \u201cfind some way to bring music into his life.\u201d\n\nBy the director\u2019s reaction, one would think Payton was already crowned \u201cBroadway Bound\u201d in senior year superlatives: \u201cI was at the assembly for River when you sang that amazing song to him. You, sir, don\u2019t have to audition.\u201d\n\nPayton is given the role of John Hinckley Jr. before he leverages his status to make sure his friend and former running mate, Infinity (Zoey Deutch), gets a part. It becomes clear this is another opportunity for Murphy to squeeze in a Plattastic performance, despite it making little sense to the overarching storyline. The episode goes on to show Payton abnormally comfortable with vocal warmups, rehearsals and trust falls before he performs \u201cUnworthy of Your Love\u201d with Infinity.\n\nAs a theater junkie, I enjoyed hearing Platt\u2019s pitch-perfect tone. As a viewer of \u201cThe Politician,\u201d I was utterly confused.\n\nAnother jarring scene comes in the finale episode when Payton \u2015 a bit older and living in New York \u2015 speaks to a bar crowd before sitting at a piano and belting out a cover of Billy Joel\u2019s \u201cVienna.\u201d It becomes clear that, at the end of the first season, Payton\u2019s high-level education and unfaltering dream of the presidency takes a back seat to his late-night singing gigs.\n\nSure, Murphy loves this sort of thing, as referenced by his powerful musical numbers in \u201cPose\u201d or the disparate ones in \u201cAmerican Horror Story.\u201d And \u201cGlee,\u201d of course, was a masterclass in staging. In those instances, performances were welcome or unexpected enough to be applauded. But hiring some of the most talented Broadway stars of our time \u2015 Platt, Michele, Billy Porter \u2015 doesn\u2019t mean song and dance always need to be in the job description.\n\nA Ben Platt reinvention was pitched.
