This is where Goldman Sachs and comes in.\n\nThe firm just issued recommendations on 3 stocks, highlighting each based on its strong long-term growth prospects. Each of these stocks also boasts substantial support from the Street with a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d analyst consensus, based on TipRanks' Stock Screener. This consensus is generated from the last three months\u2019 worth of ratings from all other analysts.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the firm\u2019s picks.\n\nMasterCard Inc. (MA)\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 James Schneider believes MasterCard is on track to see even more growth on top of the 48% year-to-date gain it has already achieved. Despite the fact that its $284 billion market cap falls below Visa\u2019s (V) $401 billion, Schneider argues that MA has a lot going for it.\n\nWith the company reporting on July 30 that gross dollar volume, the dollar value of transactions processed, gained 8% in its second quarter, MA appears to be well-positioned in terms of both its new and old electronic payment technologies.\n\nThe cashless payments company stands to benefit from the shift towards digitized money. In July, MA announced that it\u2019s partnering with Evolve Bank & Trust to create a frictionless payment system where employers can pay gig workers with an interest-free loan for service in almost real-time.\n\nNot to mention it also finalized its acquisition of Transfast that same month, giving MA the ability to disperse payments across bank accounts, mobile wallets and cards through a single API, and agreed to buy payments platform Nets for \u20ac2.85 billion on August 6 to add capacity for growth in the European market.\n\n\u201cWe are driving growth in our core products with key wins around the globe, and our recent acquisitions, such as Transfast, and new partnerships, like P27 in the Nordics, will help us address our customers\u2019 evolving payments needs, particularly in the areas of real-time account-to-account and cross-border payments,\u201d CEO Ajay Banga stated.\n\nAll of these factors played into Schneider\u2019s recommendation. As a result, the five-star analyst reiterated his Buy rating on September 3.\n\nThe rest of the Street is on the same page. With 15 Buy ratings vs 1 Hold received in the last three months, the consensus among analysts is that MA is a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019. Its $310 average price target suggests 11% upside potential.\n\nWayfair Inc. (W)\n\nThe online furniture retailer is another Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry\u2019s pick as most poised to outperform its peers.\n\nStory continues", "description": "When investors are looking for fresh investment ideas, recent recommendations from Wall Street analysts can underscore compelling investment opportunities.
