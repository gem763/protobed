This season, Demna Gvasalia, the creative director of Balenciaga, sent an enormous bouquet of hydrangeas and asters \u2014 the latter in crazy, unnatural shades of blue and chartreuse \u2014 and I brought it down to the hotel lobby, where the color scheme happens to be the same. Some things about the Paris collections never change.\n\nBut much else has, and fast.\n\nParis, of all cities, was the one that gave us extraordinary innovation \u2014 whether it was the radical patternmaking of the Japanese designers in the \u201980s, the anti-luxury of the Martin Margiela in the \u201990s, the bold expressions of gender from guys like Jean Paul Gaultier and Helmut Lang in the same era, or the complete sense of mastery we got from Karl Lagerfeld and Azzedine Alaia. Some designers still carry on that particular creative battle. I\u2019m thinking of Gvasalia, Claire Waight Keller at Givenchy, Pierpaolo Piccioli at Valentino (though more in haute couture than in ready-to-wear), Nicolas Ghesquiere at Louis Vuitton, and Virginie Viard, Lagerfeld\u2019s successor at Chanel. But my guess is it won\u2019t be long before even those dedicated soldiers \u2014 and what they represent \u2014 will start to seem like Quixotes charging at windmills.\n\nMessage is what counts now. Brand message, first and foremost, but also political and social messages that brands hope will click with millennials, like inclusivity, feminism, and environmentally sound practices. At Dior on Tuesday \u2014 the first big day of the French spring 2020 collections \u2014 Maria Grazia Chiuri offered a textbook lesson in how it\u2019s done.\n\nThe trees at Dior.

Inside, arranged in a symmetrical grove, were dozens and dozens of fully leafed-out trees with their root balls, the kind that might sell for upwards of $2,000 each. According to the press notes, they were supplied by Coloco, \u201can atelier committed to the collective art of cultivating gardens as a driver of urban inclusiveness.\u201d And they will later be replanted, so nothing was wasted on a fashion show.\n\nChiuri cited as an inspiration Christian Dior\u2019s sister, Catherine, who had a passion for gardening. She was also active in the Resistance during World War II, and was arrested and sent to the Ravensbruck concentration camp.\n\nChiuri went on to say that her aim with the collection and set was \u201cto create an inclusive garden, a place of coexistence and diversity in which every gesture counts.\u201d\n\nDior.

Indeed, she has acknowledged in interviews that the issue is a complex one for a luxury brand like Dior. Anyway, the energy expended on constructing the box and moving the trees, not to mention the congestion of cars and the huge collection \u2014 nearly 90 looks \u2014 would pretty much defeat a green message.\n\nStill, in all the videos and images, the public will see the trees, the oneness with nature. That will be the uncomplicated takeaway. Chiuri is clever.\n\nDior.\n\nMoreover, she has steadily whittled down the sartorial message at Dior. The day clothes are youthful \u2014 sometimes sporty-boyish, sometimes pretty \u2014 and the evening looks have largely adhered to the same princess shape that can be decorated (this season with mostly wildflowers in subdued hues) or left alone and layered. To me, the shape is generic. But, again, it\u2019s a simplified message.\n\nThis time there\u2019s a lot to like in the collection, in part because of a palette that seemed drawn from the colors of a garden as it goes from full June bloom to late-August fade. Chiuri showed everything with flats \u2014 lattice-cut combat boots or hemp sandals \u2014 and I rather liked her stubborn take on denim, a supersoft, wide-leg trouser with a schlumpfy, faded sweater picked out with flowers.\n\nMarine Serre.

She successfully hit on two main points \u2014 her distinctive, nipped-waist tailoring and her layered, tough-looking separates, which include new versions of her crescent-moon logo print and some great denim pieces.\n\nTelfar.

Or as he said in his notes for his Paris debut, called \u201cThe World Isn\u2019t Everything,\u201d at the storied La Cigale theatre, \u201cOur shows are the result of a radical form of collaboration that we hope borders on conspiracy \u2014 the search of the collective form; the human form; of music; of theatre and of style.\u201d For a film that ran as a backdrop, Clemens collaborated with Slave Play playwright Jeremy O. Harris, who jumped up from his seat in the front row and joined the models dancing on the floor at the end.\n\nAs for the clothes, they were classic Telfar \u2014 reconstituted classics like sweatpants, utility vests, polo shirts, and jeans.\n\nDoes it matter that the use of political messages feels pretty superficial? To some people, yes, of course it matters. I wish Serre would leave behind her self-consciously bleak imagery. She\u2019s a better designer than that. But I can also appreciate that many consumers aren\u2019t looking today for the kind of complexity \u2014 in cut, fit, history \u2014 that they once counted on from Paris designers. That kind of fashion requires too much explanation and time.\n\nInstead, a clear, powerful image of trees and watery nature must suffice.\n\nTelfar.
