Though they failed to win a match in France, it still felt like women\u2019s football in Jamaica was on the way up.\n\nBut less than three months later, that progress is in jeopardy because the Jamaican Football Federation has not paid the Reggae Girlz any of the money it has been contractually obligated to pay them since January.\n\nOn Monday, the players launched a \u201cNo Pay, No Play\u201d campaign on social media, and announced that until the JFF pays them all of the money they are owed, the women will not be attending any training camps or competing in any events \u2014 including a crucial Olympic qualifying tournament at the end of this month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re willing to sacrifice that because enough is enough,\u201d Nicole McClure, a goalkeeper on the team, told ThinkProgress in a phone call on Monday night. \u201cThe culture of this organization has been corrupt for years now. We\u2019re sick of being taking advantage of.\u201d\n\nIn May, the Reggae Girlz \u2014 excluding those who wanted to retain their NCAA eligibility by adhering to the standards of amateurism \u2014 signed a contract with the JFF. According to McClure, the contract included backpay dating back to January, and lasted until August 30, 2019. The payments were due on the 14th of each month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the very end of August, right before the contract expired, the JFF said it was wiring 50% of the money it owed to the players. Even if the promised 50% hits their bank accounts this week, players say it\u2019s not enough to stop the boycott.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slap in the face, it\u2019s hush-hush money,\u201d McClure said. \u201cIt\u2019s just really disheartening. It\u2019s messed up, because we were legally promised this. There\u2019s no way to go around it.\u201d\n\nThe players got most of the $50-per-day stipends they were owed during the duration of the World Cup in France, but that money was just to get them through the tournament. The monthly salaries were supposed to allow the players to live as professionals, and perhaps give them more time to train and practice in lieu of taking on second and third jobs.\n\n\u201cFor me personally, I don\u2019t get paid for my club team,\u201d McClure said. \u201cI was banking on the monthly stipend. Women footballers don\u2019t get paid nearly enough to survive on their own. On average, we don\u2019t get paid nearly as much as the last person on the men\u2019s team.\u201d\n\nThe JFF reportedly told the players that it hasn\u2019t paid them because it hasn\u2019t yet received the Women\u2019s World Cup prize money from FIFA, the international governing body of football. However, McClure said that the contract did not tie monthly payments to FIFA prize money in any way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFIFA should be paying attention to this dispute, however. FIFA announced it will expand the field from 24 teams to 32 teams at the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup and increase the prize money. But right now, FIFA does a horrible job holding federations accountable for treating women\u2019s football programs properly in terms of development, resources, and payment.\n\nThe Reggae Girlz are a prime example of this. In 2008, after the team failed to qualify for the Beijing Olympics, the JFF disbanded the team. It wasn\u2019t fully brought back to life until 2014, when Cedella Marley \u2014 the daughter of Jamaican music legend Bob Marley \u2014 became a benefactor for the team and helped it find sponsors and partners. But even then, the players and their families had to do a lot of personal fundraising in order to just make the trip to France happen. They said it was worth it, because they felt they were building something that future Jamaican women could benefit from, and winning institutional support along the way.\n\nBut those at the top aren\u2019t keeping up with their end of the bargain.\n\n\u201cWe created history, paved the path for future generations, without the JFF\u2019s support,\u201d McClure said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if everything that we have done means absolutely nothing to them.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1150821291.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
