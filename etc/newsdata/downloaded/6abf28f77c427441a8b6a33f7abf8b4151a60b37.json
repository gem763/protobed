He abandoned my mother and me shortly after I was born, so I have no illusions about the past. But I want to get to know him and my half sister. He has shared his medical history with me, which I really appreciate.\n\nOther than my mother, everyone in my family, even my adoptive father, is extremely supportive of me establishing a relationship with him, and even my mom says she doesn't want to stand in my way. My bio-father and I email daily and share stories of our lives. He is apologetic about what he did, reassuring that he is happy I found him, etc.\n\nMy only concern is that he refuses to tell his wife about my existence. They are both in their mid-60s and in good health and could live many more years \u2014 long enough to see my children have children. I don't expect to be immediately (or ever) invited into the fold of their family. I don't want or need money from them.\n\nI would like to eventually meet my bio-father, and he says he wants that, too, but I refuse to be a dirty little secret. The response from him about his wife and daughter is always that he doesn't want to bother them with \"this stuff.\" That feels like a dismissal, like I'm not good enough to be shared. Or maybe I just need to be patient? We've only been corresponding for a few weeks. Am I pushing for too much too soon?\n\n\u2014 Hidden\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\nHidden: I balk at the idea that not wanting your entire existence kept secret is \u201cpushing.\u201d\n\nBut, you\u2019re right, this is new for both of you, and it\u2019s a little early for \u201calways.\u201d\n\nStick with the emailing for now, keep getting and giving information. Drop the issue of meeting him or being introduced to anyone.\n\nWhen you get to the point where you\u2019re no longer interested in a relationship made entirely of email, when you\u2019ve exhausted the utility of written words: State your preference for coming out into the open, one more time. Remind him you are not \u201cstuff.\u201d If he says no again, then don\u2019t be afraid to step away from this correspondence, after telling him why.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be cutting him off, you\u2019d just be exercising your right not to keep corresponding with him on his terms of keeping you a secret. This way you give him time to get used to the idea of including you in his life, and give yourself room not to go nuts.\n\nYou can always change your mind later, or just check in at some interval, say hi and ask if he\u2019s changed his mind. Repeat as long as you have to \u2014 or still want to.", "description": "If he doesn\u2019t want to reveal his daughter\u2019s existence, she should probably stop the email communication.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "October At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
