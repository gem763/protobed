Here are some options for SA\n\nIt is widely accepted that South Africa has an infrastructure backlog that has served as structural hindrance to growth and development.\n\nWhile there is general consensus about the need for investment in infrastructure, policymakers and academics are yet to find each other on the kind of infrastructure required for investment.\n\nThe contestation has been about deciding which infrastructure would have the biggest multipliers and highest (and most equitable) social benefits as well as the scale of the investment needed.\n\nTo this effect, President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his recovery and stimulus plan (2018), earmarked investment in social infrastructure as one of the areas that have the potential to stimulate economic recovery and proceeded to announce an infrastructure fund backed by the reprioritising of public budgets and private sector lenders.\n\nIt was a move hailed by many.\n\nThis unfettered belief in infrastructure-led growth from the president is commendable but requires the government to think carefully about what sort of infrastructure will yield maximum economic benefit lest we have a reoccurrence what we have experienced over the past decade with many investments but low productivity/efficiency gains because of poor management and wrong investment choices by the government.\n\nOver the past week, students at the University of Zululand took to the streets to protest against the lack of decent student accommodation and security measures.\n\nThis catapulted the issue of student accommodation backlog to the centre of public debate and highlighted an area of interest that needed immediate public policy attention.\n\nIn 2012, the ministerial commission set to investigate the scale and magnitude of this backlog estimated that an amount of R147 billion over a 15-year period would be needed to address student accommodation shortage.\n\nThere are a number of long-term measures government can undertake to address the backlog of student accommodation in the country but the success of these measures would be contingent upon the ANC government forgoing its risk averse character.\n\nGiven the state of public finances, the below interventions I propose do not have to be financed from the government public budget (taxpayers).\n\nFor purposes of this article I limit myself to two.\n\nStrategy 1: Private-Public Partnership\n\nThe government through partnering with the private sector can establish a R200-billion facility backed by development finance institutions and private funders/lenders.\n\nThis facility would lend money to South African contractors at below market rates on condition that the contractors prove a certain % of black and female ownership in the companies.\n\nThis facility will only be lending for the development and construction of student accommodation to avoid lending for unproductive activities.\n\nOn rural-based campuses, contractors may partner with local residents located in close proximity to campus, either to sell or open their homes for development.\n\nThis would be ideal for campuses like the University of Zululand.\n\nFinancing of this strategy will be debt neutral as it won\u2019t be coming from the fiscus.\n\nDevelopment finance institutions would be required to re-prioritise their budget towards this national objective and domestic investors to open their cheque books.\n\nThere are a number of successful examples of how private-public partnerships have been instrumental in infrastructure expansion both in SA and abroad.\n\nThe Maputo Development Corridor, a toll road (N4) linking the South African mines and other industries to the port of Maputo (Mozambique), is an example of this sort of success.\n\nThis strategy can be anchored upon the principle of social compacting that brings all social partners together in the interest of finding lasting solutions to our mutual economic malaise.\n\nStrategy 2: Quantitative investing by the reserve bank\n\nThe government could issue equity (shares) against building of new student accommodation (public works) and request the South African Reserve Bank to acquire them at below-market rates.\n\nSovereign currency will be used to acquire these shares thereby bypassing debt limits imposed by fiscal policy.\n\nGovernment shares, unlike bonds, do require the government to pay interest nor add to public debt.\n\nGovernment shares would only pay dividends to the reserve bank when the student accommodation facilities generate earnings, which for social infrastructure such as public student accommodation would be nil.\n\nIn any case, the South African Constitution does not expect the reserve bank to make any income.\n\nFinancing much-needed infrastructure through government share issuance to the reserve bank would have an economic spin-off without adding to the government\u2019s already high debt and is neither consumer nor asset price inflationary as it increases productive capacity, unlike the much talked about quantitative easing.\n\nThis strategy is contingent upon rethinking of the country\u2019s monetary policy to be in line with national objectives such as infrastructure backlogs. Monetary policy can sponsor major capital projects of the country in a debt neutral manner.\n\nStudent accommodation is where it could start.\n\nCanada is a successful example of how to use sovereign currency to finance public goods.\n\nSince 1934, the Canadian state built social and economic infrastructure using sovereign currency by borrowing from its central bank up until 1974 when it joined the bank of international settlements.\n\nIt is thus not surprising to learn that Canada emerged from World War II and extensive infrastructure expansion with very little debt.\n\nPolitical economy issues to be considered\n\nThe success of these propositions is predicated upon the consideration of a few political economy issues.\n\nKey among these issues is the much needed realism by our fiscal and monetary authorities that tight macroeconomic policies are inadequate to support investment in social and economic infrastructure.\n\nInfrastructure expansion will have macroeconomic spinoffs like increasing the country\u2019s aggregate demand and providing short/long term employment creation.\n\nThe other issue to be considered is the state\u2019s capacity to implement.\n\nAny policy or strategy has to be commensurate with the state\u2019s ability to implement and manage the outcomes of the policies.\n\nIn our case, recent history shows that our governments are inefficient spenders of scarce resources owing to rampant corruption and institutionalised rent seeking in public institutions.\n\nThis has the potential to work against the promise of infrastructure led growth envisioned by the president.\n\nTo mitigate against the problem, the government will have to leverage the implementing capacity of the private sector by negotiating a fair balance between private-public sector control over capital projects however this will only be attainable if the trust deficit between government and private sector is defeated.\n\nEconomic returns of public investment in infrastructure and capital projects have well been discussed in economic literature.\n\nThese include short and long term employment creation but also increased household aggregate demand.\n\nSouth Africa is in dire need of economic and social infrastructure, but at the same time is sceptical that this will bring about debt liabilities of the state (increase public debt).\n\nFinancing of the above proposed strategies does not have to come from tax payer\u2019s money but from innovative and sovereign development financing strategies.\n\n\u2022 Hlumelo Ncopo is a former student leader and writes in his personal capacity.
