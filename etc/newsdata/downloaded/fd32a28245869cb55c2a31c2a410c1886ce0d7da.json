I ride bikes every day, I ski and I still do a lot of sports. So for me, it\u2019s a little more normal that I\u2019ll come in and do my action movies being ready and in shape,\u201d Arnold revealed about the preparation for his roles.\n\nWhile he may make hitting the gym look like child\u2019s play, he confessed that getting back into the swing of things does take its toll on him, Metro reported.\n\nYet the former bodybuilder says he\u2019ll still be strutting around on screen in his birthday suit as he did in the first Terminator in 1984, The Sun reported.\n\n\u201cI can still do that.
