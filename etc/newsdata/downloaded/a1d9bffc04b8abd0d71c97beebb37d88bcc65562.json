The head of Fortnite studio Epic Games, for example, said he supports players\u2019 right to speak out about politics and human rights. Now, however, Riot has taken the opposite approach.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, the League of Legends developer and publisher said that pro players and commentators have been told to keep their political thoughts to themselves during official broadcasts.\n\n\u201cWe serve fans from many different countries and cultures, and we believe this opportunity comes with a responsibility to keep personal views on sensitive issues (political, religious, and otherwise) separate,\u201d wrote Riot global head of esports John Needham. \u201cThese topics are often incredibly nuanced, require deep understanding and a willingness to listen, and cannot be fairly represented in the forum our broadcast provides. Therefore, we have reminded our casters and pro players to refrain from discussing any of these topics on air.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that Riot has fans in volatile places like Hong Kong, and as a result, \u201cwe have a responsibility to do our best to ensure that statements or actions on our official platforms (intended or not) do not escalate potentially sensitive situations.\u201d In telling people to stay mum about politics, Needham said Riot hopes that League of Legends can be \u201ca positive force that brings people together, no matter where they are in the world.\u201d\n\nAs of 2015, Riot was fully owned by Chinese mega-company Tencent, who also owns portions of many other video game companies including Epic and Blizzard.\n\nIn this case, Riot clearly intends to remain neutral, but as Kotaku\u2019s Joshua Rivera wrote earlier this week, video games are not neutral, and the furor surrounding Blizzard\u2019s Hong Kong fiasco\u2014which has led numerous players, commentators, and fans to protest\u2014is proof of that. In making this decision, Riot is picking a side and, through its global influence, contributing to an oppressive and harmful status quo, even if it believes it\u2019s just staying on the sidelines.", "description": "Ever since Hearthstone pro Chung \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Ng Wai got suspended for a year by Blizzard after making a declaration of support for Hong Kong earlier this week, the issue of politics during esports streams has been a hot topic.
