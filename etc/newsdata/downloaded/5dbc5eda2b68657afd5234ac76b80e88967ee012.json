REUTERS/Marco Bello\n\nBahama leaders believe hundreds and perhaps thousands remained missing in the archipelago nation of about 400,000 people, even as the official death toll rose only to 43 as of late on Friday.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration requested airlift and logistical support from the Defense Department on Friday to support relief efforts for the Bahamas, the Miami Herald and other media reported.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard and other agencies have already provided help with U.S. Northern Command chief General Terrance O\u2019Shaughnessy arriving in Nassau on Friday to assess the needs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to beef up, we\u2019ll continue to collaborate with the government of the Bahamas,\u201d he told news reporters.\n\nHurricane Dorian, the most powerful hurricane on record to hit the Bahamas, parked itself over part of the archipelago for almost two days earlier this week, pummelling it with Category 5 winds, with some gusts topping 200 mph.\n\nThe most powerful hurricane on record to hit the Bahamas levelled some neighbourhoods, swallowed others with storm surges and caused what one official described as a \u201cstaggering\u201d number of deaths.\n\nDorian also devastated parts of the Outer Banks Islands in North Carolina, on Friday and it continued to push northward along the U.S. Atlantic coast on Saturday.\n\nIt brought tropical storm force winds to southeastern Massachusetts and Nantucket Island and Martha\u2019s Vineyard on Saturday morning, according to an advisory from the Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\n\u201cDorian\u2019s rain is just grazing New England,\u201d said Alex Lamers, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nThe storm was about 160 miles southeast of Nantucket and about 310 miles southwest of Canada\u2019s Nova Scotia province early on Saturday morning, the NHC said.\n\nIt is expected to make landfall in Nova Scotia province on Saturday night with winds of about 90 mph (150 kph) and leave up to 7 inches of rain before pushing further east as a weakened post-tropical storm by Sunday, the NHC said.\n\nThe Bahamas hade only a slight, 10 percent, chance of rain Saturday that was not expected to hamper relief efforts as Bahamas Health Minister Duane Sands spoke of \u201ca tremendous loss of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cSTAGGERING\u201d NUMBER OF DEAD FEARED\n\nThe medical chief of staff at Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau said two refrigerated, 40-foot trucks would be needed to hold the \u201cstaggering\u201d number of bodies likely to be found.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve ordered lots of body bags,\u201d said Dr. Caroline Burnett-Garraway.\n\nThe United Nations estimated 70,000 people were in \u201cimmediate need of life-saving assistance\u201d such as food, water and shelter. The U.N. World Food Programme was airlifting storage units, generators, prefab offices, and satellite equipment as well as 8 metric tonnes of ready-to-eat meals.\n\nThe American Red Cross said it had committed an initial $2 million help the Bahamas recover from the hurricane, with food, water and shelter and other necessities.\n\n\u201cOur relief operation is growing, but we are also facing serious challenges in terms of delivering aid,\u201d Red Cross spokeswoman Jennifer Eli said. \u201cEven search-and-rescue choppers haven\u2019t been able to reach some people because there\u2019s no place to land. These challenges are affecting everyone.\u201d\n\nNear an area called The Mudd in Marsh Harbour, a commercial hub, a Reuters witness reported most houses levelled, the body of a man lying near a main street and dead dogs floating in water. Some residents were leaving the area with meagre possessions, while others were determined to remain.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has rescued 295 people since Dorian began, the U.S. Embassy in Nassau tweeted.\n\nRelief groups were focusing on getting doctors, nurses and medical supplies into the hardest-hit areas and helping survivors get food and safe drinking water.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. committed $1 million for hurricane relief and its ship Norwegian Breakaway left Miami on Thursday with supplies donated by the company and its employees, in addition to items collected by the City of Miami and various charities.\n\nCelebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and members of his nonprofit, World Central Kitchen, were on the ground in the Bahamas to aid hurricane survivors by preparing thousands of meals.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThe risk of outbreaks of diarrhea and waterborne diseases is high as drinking water may be tainted with sewage, according to the Pan American Health Organization, which described the situation for some people on Abaco island as \u201cdesperate.\u201d\n\nClaudin Loriston, 39, a Haitian carpenter, said he and his three young children were among the \u201clucky ones\u201d to get on a plane out of Abaco. He said he had no documents with him, but would try to get a job to support his family.\n\n\u201cThere are too many dead bodies there. The government needs to remove everyone from the island, the smell is everywhere, it\u2019s in the water.\u201d", "description": "Charities, government agencies and even cruise ships loaded with supplies and volunteers rushed emergency aid to the storm-ravaged Bahamas on Saturday amid fears of a \"staggering\" death toll left in the wake of Hurricane Dorian.", "authors": ["Nick Brown", "Zachary Fagenson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427209749&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860DP", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
