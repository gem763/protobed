Local police seized a drone, a Serbian flag and a banner that read \u201cKosovo is Serbia\u201d, as well as fireworks and a knife, from two cars with Czech licence plates.\n\nFA head of security warns of trouble before England\u2019s October trip to Prague Read more\n\nThe Czech foreign ministry confirmed the arrests took place on Friday and all eight people, one of whom also has Serbian citizenship, were released early on Saturday. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 but the Serbian government has refused to recognise the new country\u2019s sovereign status.\n\nThere are tight security measures around the stadium in the buildup to the match, which starts at 3pm local time (2pm BST). Fans can bring flags to the Group A game but many other objects are prohibited.\n\nAn online group for Kosovo supporters, known as Dardanet, has called on supporters to show \u201cmaturity and self-restraint\u201d, adding: \u201cAny potential incident would harm Kosovo.\u201d\n\nKosovo\u2019s population is substantially Albanian. In October 2014, a Euro 2016 qualifier between Serbia and Albania in Belgrade was abandoned after a drone was flown above the pitch. The drone was carrying a flag that labelled Kosovo part of \u201cGreater Albania\u201d, and sparked a mass brawl between players. Albania were eventually awarded a 3-0 default win.\n\n\n\nThe result in Pristina will affect England\u2019s qualifying campaign, with Kosovo third and the Czechs second in Group A behind Gareth Southgate\u2019s leaders, who face Bulgaria at Wembley later on Saturday.", "description": "Eight Czech football supporters have been arrested over plans to fly a drone with a pro-Serbia banner at the game in Pristina", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa58e56959f700fba7db88057be2a8758b796d3f/0_205_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b0a7ac4238ce9381e23e0f4d492371bc", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
