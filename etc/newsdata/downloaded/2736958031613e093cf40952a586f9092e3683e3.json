It was once Club 70, Edmonton\u2019s first official gay bar.\n\nThe look of the building contradicts the common understanding of what gay bars look like today: colourful places in vibrant areas.\n\nBut that\u2019s a recent phenomenon, said playwright and theatre performer Darrin Hagen, who calls himself Edmonton\u2019s unofficial gay historian. Before society\u2019s acceptance of the gay experience, LGBTQ people and their spaces were relegated to cities\u2019 dead zones, Hagen said.\n\n\n\nDarrin Hagen says gay bars opened in places no one else wanted to be.

(Trevor Wilson/CBC)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the queers move in, because nobody else wants the space,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nGay bars flourished in Edmonton in the \u201970s, \u201980s and \u201990s. But as society\u2019s acceptance of gender and sexual minorities has grown, the need for gay bars has lessened.\n\nThere are certainly fewer clubs today, but they still play an important role, said Rob Browatzke, owner of Evolution Wonderlounge, currently the only official gay bar in the city.\n\nRob Browatzke owns Evolution Wonderlounge, Edmonton's only gay bar. (Kory Siegers/CBC)\n\n\u201cAs a person involved in organized queer life, thinking about a time when society would be completely accepting and affirming of everybody, I don't think we realized then that part of that might be the loss of those queer spaces,\u201d Browatzke said in an interview.\n\nFlash back to 1969\n\nIt has now been more than 50 years since Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government decriminalized homosexuality. In Edmonton, the landmark legislation brought to the surface what was already going on underground.\n\n\u201cA bunch of enterprising queers in Edmonton decided since it\u2019s no longer illegal, we should create a space where we can gather,\u201d Hagen said.\n\nThat fall, Club 70 was born in the basement of what was then a Greek restaurant. It was meant to be named after the year the legislation passed, or at least, the approximate date.\n\n\u201cEven though it was 1969 they thought calling it Club 69 was a little cheeky,\u201d Hagen said. \u201cPlus, they were forward-thinking.\u201d\n\nThe Milla Pub's basement was home to Edmonton's first gay bar.

(Kory Siegers/CBC)\n\nThe location didn\u2019t last. The club was forced out after only a few weekends. \u201cThe landlord of the building found out what was in his basement and shut it down,\u201d Hagen said. The owner locked the doors; Club 70 owners had to sue to get their sound system back.\n\nThey eventually settled into a building on 106th Street that would house LGBTQ spaces for the next 40 years \u2014 including the Cha Cha Palace, Boots and Saddles, and later Junction, a lesbian-run bar.\n\nThe now-burgeoning 104th Street used to be one of the city\u2019s dead zones. It boasted two of the city\u2019s most popular bars: Flashback, a Studio 54-style nightclub, and the Roost.\n\nIn its heyday, Flashback was one of the city's most popular gay bars.

As a founding member of the Guys in Disguise drag group, Hagen has spent years headlining stages in bars with exactly that vibe.\n\n\u201cThe man that I am now is because of the woman I dressed as in the '80s,\u201d he said.\n\nBut glitz and glamour aren\u2019t the only attractions at gay bars. Until only recently, they were the only public places LGBTQ people could feel like themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlashback offered a safe space for members to gather as a community.

(Michael Brennan)\n\n\u201cThe bars were sort of the town halls, the town squares, for all of us to meet,\u201d Hagen said.\n\nThey provided safe spaces for their patrons. \u201cBack then, being a drag queen was something that was kind of scary,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t do it in public unless you were kind of brave.\u201d\n\nBars insulated patrons from threats and violence they might face in other places or on the street.\n\nBut members of the community also had reason to be afraid of the police, and the fear reached inside the bars and clubs.\n\nMurray Billett, a former member of the Edmonton Police Commission, came to Edmonton in the early 1990s and quickly realized there was a problem. \u201cThere was no real relationship of an official nature between the Edmonton Police Service and our fabulous community,\u201d Billett said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray Billett worked to create a relationship between the police and the LGBTQ community.

(Kory Siegers/CBC)\n\nMurray Billett worked to create a relationship between the police and the LGBTQ community. (Kory Siegers/CBC)\n\nIn 1981, nearly a decade before Billett came to Edmonton, the EPS had arrested about 60 people in a now-infamous raid on the Pisces Health Spa, a bathhouse frequented by gay men.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain to straight people how violated the queer community is when the bathhouse is raided, or when one of our bars is shut down,\u201d Hagen said. \u201cBecause most straight people will never actually have to come up against that kind of fear.\u201d\n\nBillett has a unique perspective. As a gay man, he helped found a liaison committee to create an official relationship between the LGBTQ community and the police.\n\n\n\nThe first thing on the list was getting the police to stop criminalizing a lifestyle that was legalized a decade earlier. \u201cWe called the cops out, said, \u2018What are you doing? This is absolutely unacceptable.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2018The city wasn\u2019t safe for us\u2019\n\nEarlier this year, acting on an issue that had been years in discussion, Edmonton police Chief Dale McFee delivered a formal apology to the LGBTQ2+S community. The chief publicly acknowledged that Edmonton police had failed in their duty to protect a vulnerable population.\n\n\"Many people in this room will immediately recall the raids, the mistreatment during arrests and even public shamings,\u201d McFee said. \u201cThese are just a few known and visceral examples.\n\n\"We know there is much more in the history of our service that is unheard, unseen and underground.\"\n\nWatch the apology:\n\nThe apology from McFee was a triumph for many people who had been fighting for recognition from the police of their wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cHere we are, all these years later, with the most sensible, powerful, and compelling apology that I\u2019ve seen come out of anyone, anywhere, ever,\u201d Billett said.\n\nHagen was among those invited to attend the apology. For him, it was more than just an acknowledgment of past misdeeds by the police. It stood in for society as a whole.\n\n\u201cTo hear an actual apology meant to me that finally a bit of the message had gotten through \u2014 that in fact, the only reason we need these places is because the city wasn\u2019t safe for us.\u201d\n\nThe cornerstone of Pride month, the Pride festival was cancelled this year.

(Zoe Todd/CBC)\n\nThe cornerstone of Pride month, the Pride festival was cancelled this year. (Zoe Todd/CBC)\n\n\u2018There will always be a need for spaces like this\u2019\n\nIn April, The Edmonton Pride Festival Society announced it was cancelling the Pride festival. The festival and parade had been cornerstones of Pride month, a celebration of LGBTQ life that started as a protest for equal rights.\n\nThe cancellation came after the parade was halted by protesters demanding a more inclusive Pride experience for people of colour, including banning a police presence at the parade.\n\nFor Browatzke, owner of Evolution Wonderlounge in the Boardwalk building on 103rd Street, losing the Pride festival only highlighted the continuing need for gay bars.\n\n\u201cI think there will always be need for spaces like this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNothing can compare to the first experience of a kid that\u2019s just coming out that\u2019s just 18, that\u2019s always been a part of a minority that\u2019s coming down and all of a sudden they\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, these are my people.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nEvolution Wonderlounge held a street party on the day the Pride parade was supposed to be held.

(Evolution Wonderlounge)\n\nOn the day that had been scheduled for the parade, Evolution hosted its own street party. For part of it, the bar suspended its liquor licence to accommodate a family-friendly drag show.\n\nAnd while a bar that usually doesn\u2019t allow minors is limited in its ability to be inclusive, it showed what more it could be.\n\n\u201cIt's a family centre, it's a community centre,\u201d said Browatzke, who has worked in gay bars for the past 20 years. \u201cIt's a dance club, it's an entertainment lounge. It's a little bit of everything.\n\n\u201cAnd certainly now that we are the only space like this in the city around, we need to be. And that can be super challenging, to try to be that one thing for everybody. But we do the best we can.\u201d", "description": "Edmonton's first gay bar was only open for a couple of weeks.
