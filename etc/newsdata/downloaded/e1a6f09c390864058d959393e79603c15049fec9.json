(Image: Adult Swim, YouTube)\n\nHorrible diseases, magic lab coats and a bit with a fiery dragon. All in a day\u2019s \u201cwork\u201d for Rick and Morty.\n\nAdult Swim dropped a new trailer for the long-awaited fourth season, which has been divided into two parts \u2014 with the first five episodes coming sooner than you might think.\n\nRick and Morty finally returns with the first half of season four on November 11, after a two-year gap between seasons. It\u2019s been a long and hard road getting where we are now, but based on this trailer it was definitely worth it.\n\nRick and Morty and back in full swing, fully embracing their chaotic, inter-dimensional lives... with Morty enlisting Rick to help him fill his \u201cMorty Adventure Card.\u201d\n\nAfter everything Morty has been through over the past few seasons \u2014 and how often he and others in Rick\u2019s sphere have grown tired of his crap \u2014 I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s diving even deeper into danger instead of cooling off a bit. But if most of the season was spent with Morty chilling on a couch watching TV while Rick popped in to say he bumped into some cool aliens, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a show now would it?\n\nRick and Morty returns with five episodes on November 11, presumably with the other five coming out sometime in 2020. The show\u2019s been guaranteed a whopping 70 episodes to conclude its story, so there\u2019s way way way more in store before their journey comes to an end.", "description": "Horrible diseases, magic lab coats and a bit with a fiery dragon.
