Bush, on whom we could count for at least a gaffe a week. As I recall, President Reagan carried 49 states in his landslide election, despite his many gaffes, and \u201cW\u201d twice was elected president.\n\nWhen it comes to Biden \u2014 to use the hot phrase of the month \u2014 it\u2019s \u201cbaked in\u201d with the American people that he makes gaffes. They see it as a reflection of his passion, emotion and the fact that he doesn\u2019t utilize prepared remarks when speaking publicly. It actually makes him appear genuine, authentic. And his gaffes are not outright lies; they\u2019re likely the result of a faulty memory or some confusion about the facts.\n\nIf Biden becomes the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee, let\u2019s remember he would be running against a \u201cLiar-in-Chief\u201d who probably makes misstatements two or three times a week, at least. And just for contrast, compare Biden\u2019s gaffe about the \u201cpoor kids\u201d to President Trump\u2019s performance on the Fourth of July, when he said: \u201cOur army manned the air, it rammed the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do, and at Fort McHenry, under the rockets\u2019 red glare, it had nothing but victory.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Ed Rendell", "Thehill.Com Opinion Campaign"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
