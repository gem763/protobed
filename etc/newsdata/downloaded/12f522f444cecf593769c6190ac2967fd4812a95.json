It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d Silver continued, \u201cthe NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\u201d\n\nSilver followed up that statement by telling reporters in Tokyo, ahead of a trip to Shanghai, \u201cI want this to be clear, and I think there\u2019s been some confusion around this: We are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression.\"\n\nHe added that while the protests in Hong Kong are a \u201cthird-rail issue in China,\u201d there exist values \u201cthat are deeply rooted in the DNA of the NBA, and that includes freedom of expression for our employees.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOf the possible financial harm the league might suffer for that stance, Silver said, \u201cI do know there are consequences from freedom of speech; we will have to live with those consequences.\"\n\nAD\n\nThose comments earned the admiration of Popovich, who declared last week that Silver \u201ccame out strongly for freedom of speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a heck of a leader in that respect and very courageous. Then you compare it to what we\u2019ve had to live through the past three years, it\u2019s a big difference,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cA big gap there, leadership-wise and courage-wise. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to say. He said that in an environment fraught with possible economic peril. But he sided with the principles that we all hold dearly, or most of us did until the last three years. I\u2019m thrilled with what he said. The courage and leadership displayed is off the charts by comparison.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSpurs coach Gregg Popovich says he supports the comments from NBA commish Adam Silver surrounding the controversy with the league and China. pic.twitter.com/kKadrF6Xwp \u2014 Will Manso (@WillMansoWPLG) October 8, 2019\n\nAsked at the White House the following day about China\u2019s threats to greatly curtail the NBA\u2019s presence in its lucrative market, Trump took the opportunity to jab at Popovich and Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, both of whom have been outspoken critics of the president.\n\nAD\n\nTrump asserted that Kerr, who had said that he was \u201creading about [China and Hong Kong] just like everybody\u201d but was \u201cnot going to comment further than that,\u201d was \u201cso scared to be even answering the question.\u201d The Warriors coach, according to the president, was \u201clike a little boy\u201d and \u201cshaking\u201d at the thought of responding to a question about the NBA\u2019s predicament.\n\nPopovich, on the other hand, \u201cdidn\u2019t look quite as scared\u201d to Trump. However, he was linked with Kerr as having a tendency to \u201ctalk badly about the United States.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut when the talk\u2019s about China, they don\u2019t want to say anything bad,\u201d Trump added. \u201cI thought it was pretty sad, actually.\u201d\n\nPresented with a follow-up question about his own thoughts on the NBA-China situation, which emerged just before a resumption of trade talks between the president and representatives from that country, Trump declined to offer a strong opinion.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey have to work out their own situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe NBA knows what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump criticizes Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich \u2014 both vocal critics of Trump \u2014 when asked about China putting pressure on the NBA: \"They talk badly about the United States, but when it talks about China, they don't want to say anything bad\" https://t.co/rR2dKOelYD pic.twitter.com/am9hMQcGG3 \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) October 9, 2019\n\nOnce in Shanghai for the first of two exhibition games between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets, Silver found his freedom of speech temporarily taken away by Chinese authorities, who reportedly canceled a news conference the commissioner was set to hold Thursday. Media sessions that day involving the two teams\u2019 players and coaches were also scrubbed, and the NBA went on to preemptively make its own cancellations for the second game, which was played on Saturday.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have decided not to hold media availability for our teams for the remainder of our trip in China,\u201d the league said Friday. \u201cThey have been placed into a complicated and unprecedented situation while abroad and we believe it would be unfair to ask them to address these matters in real time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBack in the United States, Kerr was first to respond to Trump\u2019s remarks, telling reporters before a Warriors preseason game Thursday, \u201cI realize the horse was out of the barn a long time on this, but for me personally, this was my experience with, \u2018Wow, has the office sunken low.\u2019\n\n\u201cMy hope is that we can find a mature unifier from either party to sit in that chair and try to restore some dignity to the Oval Office again, and I think it will happen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the past, Popovich has blasted Trump as \u201ca soulless coward,\u201d and said that the president \u201cbrings out the dark side of human beings for his own purpose.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Popovich praised the way he thought Silver \u201cstood by our nation and its principles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty huge these days,\u201d the coach continued. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s kind of Orwellian. We think we are living in a place where, \u2018Is this really happening?\u2019\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut that comparison is pretty stark, when you put our president up against those leaders when he is with them or talking to them and how he reacts compared with the way Adam Silver reacted. I was proud of him. It was great.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The Spurs coach, who was mocked by Trump over comments related to the NBA-China situation, contrasted the president with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/epo1w1eCcDOayMGzMiakvOcCuZ4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W2CSHQXDXEI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
