Mark Warner Mark Robert WarnerZuckerberg defends meetings with conservative politicians, pundits Senators take fundraising efforts to Nats playoff games Senate Intelligence report triggers new calls for action on election security MORE (D-Va.) says the former \"Breaking Bad\" star would be his choice to play him in a film.\n\n\"I got a whole lot of folks that I would love to have play me, but people would say, 'That doesn't look at all like him,'\" Warner told actress and rapper Queen Latifah when pair appeared together Tuesday at the annual Women's Achieve Summit in Richmond, Va.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter Queen Latifah suggested that anything can happen in Hollywood, Warner made his pick.\n\n\"I would say Bryan Cranston,\" Warner said of the 63-year-old actor. Cranston won a Tony Award in 2014 for his portrayal of former President Lyndon B. Johnson in Broadway's \"All the Way.\"\n\nCranston's rep didn't return ITK's request for comment about Warner's leading man proposal.\n\nWarner, 64, also had a few ideas for titles for a potential big-screen biopic.\n\n\"I still got stuff to get done, so 'A Work in Progress,' 'An Unfinished Life,'\" he said.\n\n\"We're going to have to have a great female lead to get anybody to come see that film,\" Warner added with a laugh.\n\n\"Starring Meryl Streep \u2014 anything she's in they're coming to see,\" quipped Latifah. \"So we got a hit on our hands!\"\n\nThe cinematic talk between the Academy Award nominee and Warner came after they discussed the record number of women in office \u2014 127 in the 116th Congress \u2014 and the impact it's had on Washington.\n\n\"We do not have a female majority leader, which would be a nice thing to happen in the U.S. Senate as well,\" said Warner, who is up for reelection next year.\n\n\"I think government functions better, candidly, when we have more women elected.\u201d\n\nThe reason, Warner continued, \"has nothing to do with whether you're a Democrat or Republican. It has to do with the fact that women are used to getting stuff done.\"\n\n\"I think there may be some people where I work up in Washington who actually want to make things seem so messed up, so screwed up, that it encourages people to say, 'To heck with all of them,'\" he told the crowd. \"If you don't vote, all you're doing is turning the keys over to the wackjobs \u2014 that's a technical term \u2014 on either end of the political agenda. I don't care if you're far left, far right \u2014 that is not where things get done.\"", "description": "Bryan Cranston could be looking at his next political role \u2014 Sen.
