They have also scheduled depositions with State Department officials, including some mentioned in the whistleblower complaint.\n\n\"The subpoenaed documents shall be part of the impeachment inquiry and shared among the Committees. Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry,\" Reps. Schiff, Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., wrote.\n\nPHOTO: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks during a press conference at the Palace Hotel on the sidelines of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Sept. 26, 2019.

Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., and John Yarmuth, D-Ky., the chairs of the House Appropriations and Budget Committees, respectively, wrote to the Office of Management and Budget on Friday demanding information about the withholding of military aid to Ukraine, which Trump had directed ahead of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nPelosi and top Democrats hope to keep their impeachment inquiry narrowly focused on the Ukraine matter. Some want to prepare articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving and send them to the full House of Representatives by December, allowing the House to hold a floor vote on an impeachment before the new year.\n\nStory continues", "description": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told reporters Friday that his committee is mapping out potential hearings, depositions and subpoenas for its impeachment probe in the weeks ahead, as Democrats issued the first subpoena in an effort centered on President Donald Trump's phone call", "authors": ["Benjamin Siegel", "Katherine Faulders"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/StPtBLRAsbImZG.GJY5bXw--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.gma.com/adam-schiff-rt-jef-190927_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
