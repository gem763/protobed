Even though every season of AHS is related, we get a sense of continuity from the rotating ensemble that Murphy and Falchuk use to play different characters in each season.\n\nSo, who among this rogues\u2019 gallery of AHS actors is the best? To qualify, an actor had to be in at least three of the show\u2019s eight seasons. (Cameos count and so do actors playing the same character across seasons, like Gabourey Sidibe\u2019s Queenie, who appeared in Coven, Hotel, and Apocalypse.) Here are the final results \u2014 and remember, there can only be one Supreme.\n\n19. Cheyenne Jackson (Hotel, Roanoke, Cult, Apocalypse)\n\nCheyenne Jackson in AHS: Hotel. Photo: FX\n\nFor a show with tons of murder, there are a whole lot of stiffs, including Cheyenne Jackson. His AHS roles tend to be quite small, with Cult\u2019s dastardly psychiatrist Dr. Rudy Vincent the standout to date.\n\n18. John Carroll Lynch (Freak Show, Hotel, Cult)\n\nJohn Carroll Lynch in AHS: Freak Show. Photo: FX\n\nTwisty the Clown is great and all, but not really a stretch for a veteran character actor like Lynch. Neither was clown-loving John Wayne Gacy, who he played in Hotel. Let\u2019s stop clowning around and give the guy something with meat on its bones.\n\n17. Mare Winningham (Coven, Freak Show, Hotel, Cult)\n\nMare Winningham on AHS: Hotel. Photo: FX\n\nAside from her always-washing ghost Hazel in Hotel, it\u2019s hard to remember the bit parts that Winningham has inhabited. The St. Elmo\u2019s Fire star deserves a whole lot better.\n\n16. Jamie Brewer (Murder House, Coven, Freak Show, Cult, Apocalypse)\n\nJamie Brewer in AHS: Coven. Photo: FX\n\nAn excellent actress whose roles as Constance Langdon\u2019s daughter in the first season and one of the ill-fated witches in the third never got the attention they deserve. Other than small cameos in the past few seasons, it\u2019s time for her to have a comeback.\n\n15. Gabourey Sidibe (Coven, Freak Show, Hotel)\n\nGabourey Sidibe in AHS: Coven. Photo: FX\n\nHer defiant witch Queenie was one of the highlights of Coven and a pleasant surprise when she popped up again in Hotel. But since she\u2019s busy with a regular role on Empire, she hasn\u2019t had a major AHS role for several seasons.\n\n14. Wes Bentley (Freak Show, Hotel, Roanoke)\n\nWes Bentley in AHS: Hotel. Photo: Suzanne Tenner/FX\n\nHe breezed through two of his three seasons, but did a good job as a detective with a taste for evil in Hotel. What do we have to do to get a season where he and Dylan McDermott play homicidal brothers?\n\n13. Taissa Farmiga (Murder House, Coven, Roanoke, Apocalypse)\n\nTaissa Farmiga in AHS: Murder House. Photo: Ray Mickshaw/FX\n\nWith meaty leading roles in two of the first three installments, Farmiga should have been one of the cornerstones of the AHS franchise. However, her dour Violet and similarly dour Zoe show a lack of range that is far more troubling than any of the scary monsters in the basement.\n\n12. Dylan McDermott (Murder House, Asylum, Apocalypse)\n\nDylan McDermott in AHS: Murder House. Photo: Michael Becker/FX\n\nNo one has done less to show up on this list than McDermott. Yes, his acting chops and bare-naked ass were the star of Murder House, but a quick cameo in Asylum as a serial killer and one episode reprising his original role in Apocalypse don\u2019t give him nearly the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the rest of the troupe.\n\n11. Emma Roberts (Coven, Freak Show, Cult, Apocalypse)\n\nEmma Roberts in AHS: Apocalypse. Photo: FX Networks.\n\nThere is one very good reason why Roberts is this high on the list: Madison Montgomery. Coven\u2019s bitchy teen star turned killer witch was the barb-tossing scene-stealer of the season. It was such a good character, Murphy essentially remade it for Scream Queens. However, when she isn\u2019t slashing people with her tongue, Roberts can be a bit bland.\n\n10. Adina Porter (Roanoke, Cult, Apocalypse)\n\nAdina Porter and Evan Peters in AHS: Cult. Photo: FX Networks.\n\nPlenty of AHS characters are physically tortured, but no one does emotionally tortured better than Adina Porter. In Roanoke, she played the \u201creal\u201d Lee who lost her daughter to a haunted house, and more recently she was a voodoo witch turned Oprah wannabe in Apocalypse, but it was her star turn as reporter turned cult member Beverly Hope in Cult that makes her unforgettable. Beverly\u2019s journey from victim to victimizer back to victim again was one of the best narratives of that strong season.\n\n9. Finn Wittrock (Freak Show, Hotel, Roanoke)\n\nFinn Wittrock in AHS: Freak Show. Photo: FX\n\nThe only redeeming thing about the abysmal Freak Show was Wittrock\u2019s breakout performance as Dandy Mott, an over-the-top spoiled sociopath who also happened to look pretty excellent wearing just a pair of tighty-whities. He was similarly handsome as a mostly naked model in Hotel, but totally disguised his moneymaker in Roanoke, playing one of the cannibalistic country bumpkins. It\u2019s enough to make him one of the only actors in the AHS ensemble brave enough to not rest on pretty.\n\n8. Lily Rabe (Murder House, Asylum, Coven, Freak Show, Hotel, Roanoke, Apocalypse)\n\nLily Rabe in AHS: Freak Show. Photo: FX\n\nJust like your introverted cousin Sally, Rabe is always around even though you often forget about her. Maybe that\u2019s because her roles in Murder House, Freak Show, and Hotel (where she played real-life serial killer Aileen Wuornos) were so small, you could miss them if you got up to go get a snack. Still, the demonically possessed Sister Mary Eunice in Asylum and the Stevie Nicks\u2013inspired Misty Day in Coven and Apocalypse will always be fan favorites.\n\n7. Denis O\u2019Hare (Murder House, Coven, Freak Show, Hotel, Roanoke)\n\nDenis O\u2019Hare in AHS: Hotel. Photo: FX\n\nElizabeth Taylor, the trans bartender in Hotel, is one of the show\u2019s all-time best creations. As the head of a family who runs off so she can be her true self, O\u2019Hare is stunning in the role. The openly gay actor is similarly great butching it up as a sinister burn victim in Murder House, and as a completely mute doll-collector in Coven. He rarely gets the flashiest roles (except for Liz), but he always knocks them out of the park.\n\n6. Angela Bassett (Coven, Freak Show, Hotel, Roanoke, Apocalypse)\n\nAngela Bassett in AHS: Coven. Photo: Michele K. Short/FX\n\nBassett was absolutely underutilized in Freak Show and Hotel, but when AHS gives her the material, she is an absolute master. Just look at the vengeful undying Marie Laveau in Coven, or her double portrayal of Lee Harris/Monet Tumusiime in Roanoke.\n\n5. Frances Conroy (Murder House, Asylum, Coven, Freak Show, Roanoke, Cult, Apocalypse)\n\nFrances Conroy in AHS: Coven. Photo: Michele K. Short/FX\n\nPoints for consistency: Conroy has been in every AHS season but Hotel. Sometimes the roles are smaller than others, but her stoic iciness is always perfect, especially as incestuous socialite Gloria in Freak Show. And who could forget her greatest creation, the doomed fashion witch Myrtle Snow who walked away with every scene she was in on both Coven and Apocalypse. Balenciaga forever!\n\n4. Kathy Bates (Coven, Freak Show, Hotel, Roanoke, Apocalypse)\n\nKathy Bates in AHS: Freak Show. Photo: FX\n\nAlthough she doesn\u2019t have as many installments under her belt as the AHS veterans, no one is as much of a shape-shifter as Bates. Whether it\u2019s Ethel, her Baltimore-accented bearded woman from Freak Show or the dowdy receptionist Iris in Hotel, she gives a totally different look and a complete character study each time she\u2019s on the show. She even managed to steal scenes as a severed head in Coven and Apocalypse. That\u2019s dedication to decapitation.\n\n3. Evan Peters (Murder House, Asylum, Coven, Freak Show, Hotel, Roanoke, Cult, Apocalypse)\n\nEvan Peters in AHS: Cult. Photo: FX Networks.\n\nLike horror movies in general, AHS has always been better known for its female characters than the men they\u2019re falling in love with, fighting off, or bringing back to life as unspeaking Frankenstein monsters. Peters is the only person other than Sarah Paulson to be in each season, and he\u2019s made his career playing a crazy cast of characters, from the brooding high-school shooter of Murder House and the daffy billionaire of Hotel to the misogynistic Trump maniac of Cult. Peters is the ultimate utility player, and the show would be impossible without his constant metamorphoses.\n\n2. Jessica Lange (Murder House, Asylum, Coven, Freak Show, Apocalypse)\n\nJessica Lange in AHS: Coven.\n\nFrom the very first episode of AHS, Jessica Lange was the reason to watch. She mastered the sort of campy menace that has become the program\u2019s stock-in-trade in a way that no one else could. Her best performance is Sister Jude, the strict nun who becomes a patient in Asylum, but it was the meddling neighbor Constance in Murder House that will always be her most delicious. While her scenery-chewing was perfect as the outgoing Supreme in Coven, it was a little too extreme as Elsa Mars, the head of the titular Freak Show in the next season. She walked away from the franchise for a few years, so let\u2019s hope she\u2019ll be lured back beyond her cameo scenes in Apocalypse, because it\u2019s just not the same without her.\n\n1. Sarah Paulson (Murder House, Asylum, Coven, Freak Show, Hotel, Roanoke, Cult, Apocalypse)\n\nSarah Paulson in AHS: Cult. Photo: FX\n\nThere is no American Horror Story without Sarah Paulson. Though her role as psychic Billie Dean Howard was pretty small in Murder House, she absolutely slayed as journalist Lana Winters in Asylum. She has been close to the star of the show every season since, and one of only two actors to be in each installment. Whether she\u2019s playing conjoined twins (Freak Show), a witch with severe mommy issues (Coven), or \u2014 scariest of all \u2014 a Jill Stein voter (Cult), Paulson is a bright spot in even the most dreadful season. Three times now she\u2019s played different roles in the same season, too, reprising Howard in Hotel and Winters in Roanoke and about 19 different characters in Apocalypse. Pretty soon, they\u2019ll probably make a season where she just plays every single character. It will be the best season yet.", "description": "Who\u2019s the best actor in Ryan Murphy\u2019s \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d: Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, or Jessica Lange?
