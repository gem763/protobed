At the time, FAA disputed the allegations, insisting in responses to Congress that its pilots were properly qualified.\n\nThe FAA pilots about whom qualification issues were raised are called Aviation Safety Inspectors. They administer skill tests of other pilots and perform other duties, including sitting on groups called Flight Standardization Boards. The FSB was involved in approving the pilot training criteria for 737 Max.\n\nThe FAA disputed the findings in an emailed statement, adding \u201cwe remain confident in our representations to Congress and in the work of our aviation safety professionals.\u201c\n\nThe issue had no bearing on decisions about pilot-training requirements on the 737 Max, said an agency official who wasn\u2019t permitted to speak about the matter and asked not to be named. All pilots who assessed Boeing\u2019s jet were properly qualified to do so, the person said.\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel, however, sided with the whistle-blower and said some internal FAA reviews had concluded the same thing. It found that 16 of 22 FAA pilots conducting safety reviews, including making decisions on the 737 Max when it came into service two years ago, \u201clacked proper training and accreditation,\u201d according to the OSC letter to President Donald Trump. The OSC letter was first reported by the Washington Post.\n\nThe two crashes of the 737 Max, which led to 346 deaths, were \u201cclosely linked with crew training resources and familiarity with operational procedures\u201d -- which were under the authority of some of the improperly trained pilots, the letter said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alan Levin in Washington at alevin24@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, John Harney, Derek Wallbank\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- American aviation regulators misled Congress about a whistle-blower\u2019s allegation that many inspectors performing safety assessments on the now-grounded Boeing Co. 737 Max airplane weren\u2019t properly qualified to certify pilots or assess pilot training, a government watchdog agency has concluded.The", "authors": ["Alan Levin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WSiVaZtoXFUyhul9GBMQfg--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/07ffb24e6a85e26c1be274d6cfa26021", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
