Jeanne Shaheen next fall.\n\n\u201cHe can win because he will take all the Trump supporters right away \u2014 boom!\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who likes Trump is voting for Cory.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. 2, he is a great debater, he is a great speaker, and when he gets her in a debate one-on-one, she is going to be hiding under that podium because one thing about Cory he comes prepared,\u201d he said.\n\nPolitical handicappers say Ms. Shaheen is favored to win reelection \u2014 though a Lewandowski run would dramatically change the contours of the race.\n\nHis ties to Mr. Trump would make him the wild card in the race, and could help him raise a ton of money from people like Mr. Deluca, who said he plans to donate upwards of $200.\n\nPolls show would Mr. Lewandowski would enter the GOP primary race as the front-runner, but he trails Ms. Shaheen by double-digits in a hypothetical general election match-up.\n\nFormer New Hampshire House Speaker Bill O\u2019Brien, retired Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc and Bryant Messner are already in the GOP primary race.\n\nDemocratic voters, meanwhile, said they don\u2019t think Mr. Lewandowski belongs anywhere near public office.\n\n\u201cHe is your typical mercenary,\u201d said John Amato, 66. \u201cHe\u2019s sticking his finger up in the air and seeing which way the wind blows \u2026 I am not fond of him at all.\u201d\n\nOthers called him a white supremacist and a bully.\n\nMatt, an independent who didn\u2019t want to give his last name, said he doesn\u2019t like the idea of sending Trump reinforcements.\n\n\u201cIf he gets elected and Trump gets elected that is another vote Trump is going to have in the Senate,\u201d the 72-year-old said.\n\nMr. Gregory, though, said Mr. Lewandowki would help Mr. Trump shake things up in Washington.\n\n\u201cIf he ran I\u2019d vote for him because I am not happy with Washington \u2014 nothing gets done,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just fight about Trump all day.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
