Gone are the years when candidates argued over minor differences in capital gains tax rates, or increasing the national debt by a percent or two. We\u2019re now in a race to find the top of the list of the craziest ideas ever.\n\nAnd, while not leading in the polls, it seems that Bernie Sanders used his few days off to take the clear lead on the crazy idea list. Forget about Elizabeth Warren\u2019s nonsense of requiring 40 percent of public companies\u2019 directors be employees. And, forget about Andrew Yang paying everyone a guaranteed income of $1,000 a month. Last week, Sen. Sanders released what he\u2019s billed as a \u201cCorporate Accountability Plan.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start by just picking the low hanging fruit on this one \u2014 and even here there\u2019s a lot to pick. His plan mirrors part of Sen. Warren\u2019s proposal \u2014 dare I say \u201ccopies\u201d \u2014 and proposes requiring public companies have 45 percent of their directors be employee-elected. Yes, he does one-up her here by 5 percent, but \u2026 details.\n\nBut, while Ms. Warren\u2019s plan requires 40 percent of boards be employee elected, it doesn\u2019t really say how those votes get cast or counted. Mr. Sanders, on the other hand, adds a little kicker to elect his 45 percent \u2014 even though his math is off a bit. His plan would require companies to give the employees 20 percent of the firm\u2019s stock. Just to be clear, that means the stock the employees get can cast 2.25 votes per share, while folks that actually buy the stock only get one vote per share.\n\nThe twists and turns of this crazy idea are like being a passenger in your grandfather\u2019s car long after you should have taken away the keys. Think of it this way \u2014 why would anybody purchase stock in a company that immediately would be devalued by 20 percent and could be outvoted on a share basis by more than 2-1? Too late \u2014 you didn\u2019t grab the keys!\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019 stock plan doesn\u2019t just stop with making employees into a kind of Super Delegate when it comes to voting. He also would require companies to pay dividends on the stock that he estimates would be about $5,000 per employee. Before we do the math on this one, what if the company doesn\u2019t have the cash to pay the dividend, or it needs its cash to grow the business? A large percentage of public companies don\u2019t pay dividends even to the shareholders that bought the stock. They don\u2019t have the cash sitting around.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to do some math. Let\u2019s pick a company. Any will do, but we\u2019ll pick a big successful one and see how this $5,000 per employee dividend might work. How about Walmart? Bernie loves to bash Walmart, so let\u2019s use it as an example of how this might work.\n\nWalmart has about 3 billion shares outstanding. Under the plan we give 20 percent of those to the employees (of which there are 1.4 million in the U.S.) and that works out to 421 shares per person. Now remember, each of those workers is supposed to get $5,000 in dividends, so that is about $119 per share per year. But wait! Every share gets that dividend, so when we go back and pay $119 on all 3 billion shares it works out to about $350 billion in cash per year. That\u2019s 15 times Walmart\u2019s annual free cash flow of $23 billion before dividends. Where\u2019s the cash supposed to come from?\n\nYou can play this math game with just about any large corporation and it comes out about the same. As an aside, Walmart currently pays a little over $2 per share in dividends which is considered a fairly decent return by investors. This one isn\u2019t even a close call and debatable. It\u2019s actually not just an impossible idea, it\u2019s crazy. And speaking of crazy, it\u2019s like Jack Nicholson\u2019s character says in \u201cAs Good As It Gets\u201d: \u201cWe\u2019re all stocked up here.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Kevin Cochrane teaches business and economics at Colorado Mesa University, and is a visiting professor of economics at The University of International Relations in Beijing.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
