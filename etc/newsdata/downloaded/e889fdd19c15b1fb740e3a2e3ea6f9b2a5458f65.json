I was able to preserve more than 13,000 searches and 98,000 web pages, and I found very dramatic bias in Google's search results... favoring Hillary Clinton -- whom I supported strongly.\"\n\nHILLARY CLINTON SLAMS TRUMP FOR SHARING 'DEBUNKED STUDY' THAT GOOGLE MANIPULATED 'MILLIONS OF 2016 VOTES\n\nRegarding the specific results of his study, Epstein claimed the findings showed what he called a sizable bias.\n\n\"That level of bias was sufficient, I calculated, to have shifted over time somewhere between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes to Hillary without anyone knowing that this had occurred,\" he claimed.\n\nIn response, host Mark Levin asked how such bias could materialize.\n\nEpstein said people searching Google for politically relevant or election-related information will see search suggestions pop up as they type, and also see a number of top searches on the first page of their results. He claimed the alleged bias manifested itself largely within those two areas.\n\nGOOGLE WOES: ANTITRUST CONCERNS, YOUTUBE FINE AND CORPORATE CULTURE CLASHES KEEP TECH GIANT ON THE HOT SEAT\n\n\"We now know that those search suggestions have a very, very powerful effect on people and that they alone can shift opinions and votes dramatically and then search results appear below,\" he said.\n\n\"The point is if there's a bias in them -- which means if a search result that's high up on the list, if that takes you to a web page that makes one candidate look better than another -- if you're undecided and you're trying to make up your mind, what we've learned is that information posted high in Google search results will shift opinions among undecided people dramatically because people trust Google.\"\n\nHowever, last month Clinton -- the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee -- criticized President Trump for citing Epstein's study, claiming it has been \"debunked.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The debunked study you\u2019re referring to was based on 21 undecided voters,\" she said.\n\n\"For context that\u2019s about half the number of people associated with your campaign who have been indicted.\"\n\nClinton's response was spurred by a presidential tweet highlighting the fact Epstein supported the former secretary of state's candidacy and claiming Google should be taken to court.\n\n\"Report just out! Google manipulated from the 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 election! This was put out by a Clinton supporter, not a Trump Supporter! Google should be sued. My victory was even bigger than thought!\" the president's full tweet read.\n\nTune in Sunday at 10 p.m. ET for the full interview on \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\"\n\nFox News' Joseph Wulfsohn contributed to this report.", "description": "Google allegedly\u00a0offered search results during the 2016 election season that manipulated voters in Hillary Clinton's favor, according to research psychologist Dr. Robert Epstein.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/RobertEpstein.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
