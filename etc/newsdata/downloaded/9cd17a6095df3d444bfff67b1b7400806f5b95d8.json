Training camps have been established in regional areas and, unlike the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, which will be held mostly in Tokyo and its surrounds, this tournament is giving well-needed economic impetus and oomph to regions.\n\nAdam Ashley-Cooper takes on Dane Haylett-Petty during a training session in Oita.

Tourists tend to only visit the cities within the so-called Golden Triangle: Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. So World Rugby is helping to shine a light on areas outside Japan\u2019s major cities \u2013 regions that are both beautiful and often overlooked.\n\nFor months now, the benefits of RWC2019 have been felt throughout regional Japan, with training camps and events designed to whip up excitement among the non rugby-playing population.\n\nThe transformation of interest and national pride has been \"amazing\". Getty\n\nAs many as 40,000 Australians signed up for a visit to Japan and bought tickets; 15,000 alone visited Sapporo for the Wallabies' opening match in September. Qantas will be happy that a new band of Hokkaido fans has been created ahead of the direct charter flights scheduled to start up later in the year.\n\nI sat next to an Australian tourist on a local train in Kyushu last weekend. She had never been to Japan but, as a fan of food and rugby, she decided to sign up for one of Adam Liaw\u2019s gourmet-and-rugby tour packages. She said she just loved learning more about Japan and food and would definitely be back.\n\nI hope tourists will do what she did and pop into Tokyo before going to explore different parts of Japan. That way, they might learn to love regional Japan as much as I do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYokohama, host of some of the big matches and the final series, is using the tournament to broaden its children\u2019s understanding of the world.\n\nSchool lunches using ingredients of all the countries represented have been on offer for months now. I love that Japanese kids have been eating goulash, empanadas and pork pies. No-one loves Vegemite more than I do, but I hope Japanese tuck-shops haven\u2019t offered Vegemite sandwiches up as our contribution to the national meals series.\n\nI asked Ian Williams, a former Wallabies (#664, 44 games and 17 tests) and Brave Blossoms (#329) star winger, for his thoughts on Japan and the RWC. Ian was the first Wallaby to play in Japan, in 1989.\n\n\u201cThe transformation of interest and national pride in the achievements of the Brave Blossoms since the win over the Springboks in the 2015 RWC followed by the recent win over Ireland and now Scotland has been amazing,\u201d he said.\n\nYokohama, host of some of the big matches and the final series, is using the tournament to broaden its children\u2019s understanding of the world. AP\n\n\u201cJapanese TV is filled with detailed analysis of the difference between a scrum, lineout and rolling maul. The streets and stadiums are filled with fans wearing cherry red and white jerseys and the train and subway stations have giant posters of the players.\"\n\nThrough rugby, Japan is further opening to the world and both Japanese and overseas rugby fans are embracing it with a passion never seen before. I hope that passion turns into greater commitment to the development of women and girls\u2019 rugby. More women players (including girls) registered last year than in previous years. It is the perfect time to broaden the base.\n\nThere are opportunities for Australian business as Japan develops the concept of sport for business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore women and girls registered to play rugby last year. Getty\n\nCorporate hospitality, sponsorship, stadia/sporting infrastructure, sporting camps, referee development and sport tourism are just some of the areas where I predict solid growth. Australian companies with an interest in working with Japan in this area should do your homework, write up a plan (in Japanese and English) and then jump on a plane. The timing is perfect but maybe give us all a few weeks to recover.\n\nI really hope the Brave Blossoms do well in the match against South Africa at the weekend. And, of course, I will be barracking as loud as I can for the Wallabies. Go Australia! Go Japan!\n\nSayonara for now. @melanie_brock\n\nThis is the fifth in a series looking at life in Japan.", "description": "AFR columnist Melanie Brock finds Japan's newfound \u2013 for many \u2013 love of everything rugby infectious.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0347%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2700043580588ac0ce5483542f43785c53bbca4c", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
