Add Interest\n\nSoules was convicted for leaving the scene of a personal injury accident that resulted in the death of a 66-year-old army veteran, Kenneth Mosher.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Soules said he recognizes the terrible loss for the Mosher family and talks about how his life has changed since the accident.\n\n\u201cIt made everything really hard on my family and everyone around me, including myself,\u201d Soules told ABC News' Michael Strahan.\n\nMany remember Soules as the charming farmer from rural Iowa who appeared on the 10th season of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d in 2014. He went on to star on his own season of \"The Bachelor\" and \"Dancing With the Stars.\"\n\nRick Rowell/ABC\n\nTwo years after his season ended, Soules was arrested and later convicted for leaving the scene of an accident involving Mosher, a local farmer, husband, father and grandfather.\n\nSoules describes the day of the accident as any normal day on his farm. He said that he was on his way to pick up one of the men he hired. He was driving on a rural road at night when he crashed into a tractor being driven by Mosher.\n\nCourt documents say that Mosher was traveling down the dark road without any lights on the tractor.\n\nSoules says he crawled out of his truck and called 9-1-1 after he saw Mosher in a ditch nearby with another truck driver who witnessed the accident.\n\n\u201cAll I remember is waking up and -- and radioing to my father and all my hired men, just saying, \u2018I need help,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the paramedics arrived, Soules decided to leave the scene - a critical decision that he has been criticized for.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I was thinking clearly,\u201d the 37-year-old said. \u201cI notified the authorities of what had happened, the paramedics were there, but now I know I was scared and wanted to be in a safer place and be outta there.\u201d\n\nPolice arrested Soules hours later at his home after informing him that Mosher had died.\n\nBecause he left the scene, Soules has been questioned on whether he had something to hide.\n\n\"I had nothing to hide, honestly,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the police report, several alcoholic beverage containers were found in Soules\u2019 vehicle, a car he says was used by other people for work-related reasons.\n\n\u201cI was not drinking that night,\u201d he told \u201cGMA.\u201d \u201cThe fact is the truck is not mine. It\u2019s not even in my name. We employ over 15 people that -- at any time use that truck for work-related things ... and those cans could have been anybody's.\u201d\n\n\"There were four witnesses that swore under oath that they saw no evidence of me appearing to be intoxicated or under the influence of any sort of drug or alcohol,\" he added.\n\nIn August, Soules plead guilty to a reduced misdemeanor charge -- leaving the scene of a personal injury accident. He\u2019s now serving two years' probation.\n\n\"I was never charged with causing the accident. I was charged with leaving the scene of a serious injury accident,\" Soules said. \"A man did die and that was a tragedy. My sentence is living with this for the rest of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sentence is replaying that moment standing there on the pavement and walking up to a man that wasn\u2019t breathing \u2026 knowing I was involved in that -- that\u2019s the sentence that I\u2019ve been given.\u201d\n\nSoules told \u201cGMA\u201d that he hopes to speak with Kenneth Mosher\u2019s family and heal together.\n\n\"I wish I could have done more. I wish I could have saved his life,\" he said. \"I wish I wouldn't have been on that road. I did everything I could.\"", "description": "Chris Soules, a former contestant on", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/chris-soules-file-ap-jef-190918_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
