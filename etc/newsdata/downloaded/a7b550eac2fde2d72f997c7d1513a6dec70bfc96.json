Revenue rose 5.9% a year ago and grew by 3.3% in Q2.\n\nExcluding the energy sector, Q3 earnings are expected to fall just 0.3% with revenue increasing 3.1%, the data showed.\n\nAs the global economy falters, investors have braced for a tough earnings season, which kicks off in earnest next week and will test the stock market's stellar rally this year.\n\nThe pan European STOXX 600 index is up 16.6% this year.\n\nCompanies in the region have been in an earnings recession since the second quarter when earnings fell 2.1%, posting their second straight quarterly fall.
