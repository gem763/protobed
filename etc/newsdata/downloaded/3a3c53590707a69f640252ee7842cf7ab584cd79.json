Uber disclosed breach of 57 million users a year later\n\nUber soon agreed to pay $100,000 in bitcoin through a third party and demanded they sign confidentiality agreements.\n\nIn December 2016 they demanded money from LinkedIn's Lynda.com for a promise to delete more than 90,000 records, but stopped communicating in January as the company sought to identify them.\n\n'We're dealing with the most sophisticated cyber actors in the world,' said FBI Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett.\n\n'In order to take on those people on the front lines of the cyber security battle, we rely heavily on our valued relationships and open dialogue with private sector companies in cyber industries. Their willingness to speedily report intrusions to our investigators allows us to find and arrest those who commit data breaches.'\n\nThe pair went on to demand money from LinkedIn's and Lynda.com for a promise to delete more than 90,000 records, but the company managed to identify them instead\n\nThe Uber breach saw a $148 million settlement over allegations the company violated state data breach reporting and data security laws.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra was highly critical of Uber at the time.\n\n'Uber's decision to cover up this breach was a blatant violation of the public's trust,' Becerra said in a statement. 'The company failed to safeguard user data and notify authorities when it was exposed. Consistent with its corporate culture at the time, Uber swept the breach under the rug in deliberate disregard of the law.'\n\nThe breach saw the ousting of Joe Sullivan, Uber's chief security officer and Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s former chief executive who oversaw the payments.", "description": "Two hackers, Vasile Mereacre from Toronto and Brandon Glover from\u00a0 Florida, have pleaded guilty to stealing millions of users' data from ride-hailing firm Uber, LinkedIn and other U.S. companies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/22/20399010-0-image-a-14_1572474491387.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
