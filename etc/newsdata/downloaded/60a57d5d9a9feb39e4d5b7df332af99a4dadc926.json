People are already gathered for the burial later this afternoon [yesterday] and we are happy that we are bringing this issue to an end. This will allow us as a family to move on and to focus on other issues,\u201d said a family member who declined to be named.\n\nThe decision to have Mugabe buried in Zvimba was controversial and came after intense bickering and heated debates.\n\nGrace reportedly had a fallout with elders and chiefs from Mugabe\u2019s rural homestead, with sources saying she accused them of siding with Mnangagwa as they pushed for the burial to be at the traditional National Heroes Acre in Harare.\n\nMany top heroes of Zimbabwe\u2019s liberation war \u2013 including previous vice-presidents and struggle stalwarts \u2013 are buried at Heroes Acre.\n\nMnangagwa and the Mugabe family had earlier agreed to have the former Zimbabwean leader buried at the national shrine, but the case assumed a sharp twist after EFF leader Julius Malema visited Zimbabwe to pay his last respects to Mugabe.\n\nMalema was in Zimbabwe earlier in the week and viewed Mugabe\u2019s body in his blue-roof mansion in Harare.\n\nReports during the week showed that Grace had applied to the Harare City Council to have Mugabe buried at his residence. The city fathers turned down the request.\n\nEarlier this month, the government hosted a funeral service for Mugabe at the National Sports Stadium which was attended by regional leaders and former presidents from countries, including South Africa and Namibia, among others.\n\nThey tormented him to the last day. We were giving Grace and the family our support in respect of the last wishes of Mugabe\n\nMalema said after his visit that Mugabe\u2019s last words had to be respected and criticised Mnangagwa\u2019s government for trying to gain political mileage by insisting that Mugabe be buried at the Heroes Acre.\n\n\u201cThey tormented him to the last day. We were giving Grace and the family our support in respect of the last wishes of Mugabe,\u201d said Malema.\n\n\u201cIn our African traditions, the words of the deceased cannot be undermined by anyone, no matter how powerful you think you are.\u201d\n\nRITUALS\n\nBut it was his burial in a specially designed and tamper-proof casket that left many Zimbabweans with more questions than answers regarding the power-play dynamics within Zanu-PF.\n\nMugabe, according to his family\u2019s spokesperson, Leo Mugabe, was worried that some powerful politicians wanted to use his body parts for rituals.\n\nWe are afraid that some people are after his body parts or even his whole body and they want to use that for rituals\n\nLeo Mugabe told City Press that the family had been made aware of Mugabe\u2019s fears in his last days.\n\n\u201cYou know some people have an inclination for rituals. We are afraid that some people are after his body parts or even his whole body and they want to use that for rituals,\u201d Leo Mugabe said.\n\nFearful about this, the Mugabe family had resolved to bury the late Zimbabwean leader in a specially designed casket.\n\nThis had motivated the family\u2019s decision to have him buried at his rural compound in a courtyard.\n\n\u201cThe casket is tamper-proof and there is nothing unusual about that because we are trying to follow his last wishes which he confided to his wife before he passed on; he intimated that there were people who wanted to use his body for rituals,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier suggestions at the beginning of this month indicated that Mugabe would be buried next to his mother in the same village but some family members said there was no space for a new grave at his mother\u2019s graveside.\n\nMugabe\u2019s remains left his blue-roof mansion on Thursday, escorted by military and police vehicles.\n\nHis body lay in state at the rural compound before his burial yesterday.\n\n\u201cSomeone within the family told Grace that the mausoleum would not be for Mugabe only but would house graves of other Zimbabwean presidents. She was expressly against this and that was what pushed her to opt for the courtyard burial. She had also clashed with chiefs and elders from Mugabe\u2019s home about where his body should be buried,\u201d said a family member.\n\nSome political analysts have expressed concerns that Mnangagwa\u2019s government might persecute Grace for \u201cembarrassing Mnangagwa\u201d by refusing to have Mugabe buried at the Heroes Acre in Harare.\n\nSaid Zimbabwe Democracy Institute\u2019s Pedzisai Ruhanya: \u201cLet the burial proceed and get done with and observe Zanu-PF vengeance thereafter. We know they won\u2019t take it lying down. They feel disrespected by the Mugabe family.\u201d\n\nRead: Mondli Makhanya: From Mugabe to Buthelezi, why do we tell glowing lies about brutal legacies?\n\nHowever, Mnangagwa\u2019s government said it supported the wishes of the family, signalling an end to the strained relations between the two parties 22 days after Mugabe\u2019s death at a hospital in Singapore.\n\nNick Mangwana, permanent secretary for the information ministry, said \u201cthe family of the late former president has expressed its desire to proceed with his burial\u201d in Zvimba.\n\nHe said it was government\u2019s policy \u201cto respect the wishes of the families of deceased heroes\u201d.\n\nMnangagwa was attending a UN conference in New York.", "description": "Former Zimbabwe leader Robert Mugabe has finally been buried at his rural Zvimba home, bringing to an end the dramatic and bitter disputes between his surviving spouse Grace and President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s government.", "authors": ["Memory Mataranyika", "Tawanda Karombo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9373/6941bb114c0c49dcb5420473486f4b99.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
