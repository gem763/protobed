Chinese retribution was quick as all 11 of the NBA's official Chinese partners suspended ties, and appearances and endorsement deals were cancelled \u2014 just as the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets arrived in Shanghai for two exhibition games.\n\nAmericans were feted to the sight of Houston\u2019s James Harden and LeBron James of Los Angeles reciting their lines like kidnapping victims in a ransom video.\n\nHarden\u2019s \"We apologize. You know, we love China\u201d was forgettable enough, and Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr helpfully informed us \u201cThe world is a complex place and there\u2019s more gray than black-and-white\u201d when asked about the NBA kowtowing to the Chinese government. But @KingJames wrote his epitaph with, \u201cSo just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, it can be a lot of negative that comes with it\" \u2014 which is probably what the Chinese government tells the Chinese people.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf LeBron James were some Vice President of GM, no one would care what he said or did, but he\u2019s a woke celebrity and an activist for labor rights and social justice who forgot when you attack others for their failings, real or imagined, you raise the bar for yourself.\n\nThe Hong Kong protestors \u2014 the real activists \u2014 registered their disappointment, some by burning #23 jerseys and commenting \u201cLeBron James stands for money. Period.\"\n\nWesley Snipes said, \u201cAlways bet on black\u201d but the NBA proves the most powerful color is green.\n\nHow much green?\n\nAccording to NBC News, last year 800 million Chinese watched an NBA game, \u201cthe league is estimated to be worth about $5 billion in China\u2026 and the NBA just signed a new partnership agreement with an internet company in the country for $1.5 billion.\u201d China is 10 percent of the league\u2019s revenue \u2014 and that could climb to 20 percent by 2030.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr. James gets by on $35 million from the LA Lakers, and $32 million from Nike (part of an alleged $1 billion lifetime deal), but the post-NBA money will come from his SpringHill Entertainment which is collaborating with Warner Brothers on \"Space Jam 2\" that James will produce and star in. The movie will make a lot of money in China \u2014 if Beijing\u2019s censors allow it in \u2014 which is probably what occupied his mind on that long flight back from China.\n\nAnd Nike\u2019s shoe sales in China doubled in the last five years, and the company has 110 factories and over 145,000 workers in China. After all, those $110 #23 jerseys don\u2019t stitch themselves.\n\nIn fact, who does stitch them?\n\nNike doesn\u2019t say. But according to the Citizen Power Institute (CPI), much of China\u2019s apparel production is done by up to 1 million of China\u2019s Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic groups detained in so-called re-education camps or vocational training centers, intended to cleanse them of their ethnic and religious identity and make them loyal to the Communist Party of China.\n\nThe camps and centers are in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which produces 84 percent of China\u2019s cotton crop (Nike says the #23 jerseys are 100 percent recycled polyester), and most are run by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), a paramilitary organization that reports directly to the Communist Party of China and is tasked to help maintain political stability in Xinjiang. One of the ways it is doing so is by detention of large numbers of Uighurs in \"re-education camps\" which complements the Chinese government\u2019s goal of vertical integration of the garment manufacturing sector.\n\nThe XPCC operates through a network of joint-ventures and front companies that produce the finished goods. One of the XPCC\u2019s joint-venture partners is Hong Kong-based Esquel Group, which produces clothing for Nike.\n\nXPCC hasn\u2019t just assembled an efficient garment production operation. According to CPI, XPCC\u2019s \u201cinmates serve as a key labor force in every link of China\u2019s cotton value chain, from cotton field reclamation to planting, harvesting, processing, and garment production.\u201d\n\nIf the NBA would crack a history book, it might learn that \u201ccotton field reclamation to planting, harvesting\u201d was the cause of the \u201cWar Between the States.\u201d\n\nDo the NBA and its players understand this? You bet.\n\nJust understand all that \u201cInjustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere\u201d for what it is \u2014 marketing \u2014 and that the league confines its posturing and tweeting only where there are no financial consequences.\n\nAnd there probably won\u2019t be any financial penalties for the NBA, Nike, or LeBron and the other players, according to marketing experts who say \u201cthis will pass.\u201d\n\nBut one thing it has done is take the sharp edges off the ability of the league and the players to gratuitously comment on political and social issues du jour, knowing the rejoinder may be \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you speaking out about Uighur slaves in cotton fields?\u201d\n\nLeBron James always wanted to be \u201cMore Than an Athlete\u201d but is this what he had in mind?\n\nJames Durso (@james_durso) is the Managing Director of Corsair LLC, a supply chain consultancy.
