REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino\n\nOn Monday it was Bolivia - angry people clashed with police after the political opposition said it had been cheated in an election won by incumbent President Evo Morales.\n\nLast week, the streets of the Chilean capital Santiago descended into chaos, as demonstrators enraged by a hike in public transport fares looted stores, set a bus alight and prompted the president to declare a state of emergency.\n\nEarlier this month, Ecuador\u2019s leader did the same after violent unrest triggered by the decision to end fuel subsidies that had been in place for decades.\n\nAnd that was just South America.\n\nHong Kong has been in turmoil for months, Lebanon\u2019s capital Beirut was at a standstill, parts of Barcelona resembled a battlefield last week and tens of thousands of Britons marched through London at the weekend over Brexit.\n\nProtests have flared around the world in the last few months. Each has had its own trigger, but many of the underlying frustrations are similar.\n\nGlobalization and technological progress have, in general, exacerbated disparities within countries, said Sergei Guriev, former chief economist of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, while noting that not all of the current protests were driven by economic concerns.\n\nDigital media has also made people more acutely aware of global inequalities, said Simon French, chief economist at UK bank Panmure Gordon.\n\n\u201cWe know that the economics of happiness is largely driven by a relative assessment of your position versus your benchmark,\u201d he said, a benchmark that now stretched way beyond the local community.\n\nECONOMICS\n\nIn at least four countries hit by recent violent protests, the main reason for the uprising is economic.\n\nGovernments in Chile and Ecuador have incurred their people\u2019s wrath after trying to raise fares and end fuel subsidies.\n\nAs clashes engulfed Quito, Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno reached out to indigenous leaders who had mobilized people to take to the streets.\n\nWithin minutes, chief protest organizer Jaime Vargas had rejected that outreach.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re defending the people,\u201d Vargas said in a live Facebook video from the march in Quito.\n\nHis response, visible to millions of people, underlines an added challenge authorities have when trying to quell dissent: social media has made communication between protesters easier than ever.\n\nTens of thousands of people have flooded Beirut in the biggest show of dissent against the establishment there in decades. People of all ages and religions joined to protest about worsening economic conditions and the perception that those in power were corrupt.\n\nSimilar factors were behind deadly civil unrest in Iraq in early October.\n\nMore than 100 people died in violent protests across a country where many Iraqis, especially young people, felt they had seen few economic benefits since Islamic State militants were defeated in 2017.\n\nSecurity forces cracked down, with snipers opening fire from rooftops and the internet being shut to stem the flow of information among protesters.\n\nGIVE US OUR AUTONOMY\n\nHong Kong has been battered by five months of often violent protests over fears Beijing is tightening its grip on the territory, the worst political crisis since colonial ruler Britain handed it back to China in 1997.\n\nThere have been few major rallies in recent weeks, but violence has escalated at those held, with militant activists setting metro stations ablaze and smashing up shops, often targeting Chinese banks and stores with mainland links.\n\nPolice have fired thousands of rounds of tear gas, hundreds of rubber bullets and three live rounds at brick- and petrol bomb-throwing activists.\n\nThe events in Hong Kong have drawn comparisons to Catalonia in recent days. There, too, people are angry at what they see as attempts to thwart their desire for greater autonomy from the rest of Spain, if not outright independence.\n\nProtesters set cars on fire and threw petrol bombs at police in Barcelona, unrest sparked by the sentencing of Catalan separatist leaders who sought to declare an independent state.\n\nDemonstrators also focused on strategic targets to cause maximum disruption, including the international airport, grounding more than 100 flights.\n\nThat came several days after similar action in Hong Kong, suggesting that protest movements are following and even copying each other on social media and the news.\n\n\u201cIn Hong Kong they have done it well, but they are crazier,\u201d said Giuseppe Vayreda, a 22-year-old art student at a recent Catalan separatist protest.\n\nOn Thursday, Hong Kong protesters plan a rally to show solidarity with those demonstrating in Spain.\n\nLEADER OR NO LEADER\n\nIn some cases, individuals rise to the forefront of protest movements, using social media to get their message across.\n\nIn Egypt, where demonstrations last month were relatively small yet significant in their rarity, the catalyst of dissent against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was an Egyptian posting videos from Spain.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nGreta Thunberg, a Swedish teenager, inspired millions of people to march through cities around the world in September to demand that political leaders act to stop climate change.\n\nTens of thousands gathered in a New York park to listen to her speech.\n\n\u201cIf you belong to that small group of people who feel threatened by us, then we have some very bad news for you,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause this is only the beginning. Change is coming whether they like it or not.\u201d", "description": "Another day, another protest.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1443993050&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0A9", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
