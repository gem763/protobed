It started off with an incredible atmosphere and they were brilliant,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut the All Blacks were fantastic tonight. We felt we prepared well all week, we felt we had a game plan, we felt we had enough in our armoury to beat them.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I think we made a target of ourselves, certainly teams went after us a little bit more.\n\n\u201cWe had been able to kind of sneak up on New Zealand a couple of times, and sneak up on a few other teams.\u201d\n\nAll Blacks forward Brodie Retallik felt his side produced an \u201cawesome spectacle\u201d as he turned his attention towards the clash with England.\n\n\u201cWe have only seen bits and bobs (of England), and I saw a bit of the Australia game, but they are playing with great skill,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey have great outside backs with a good forward pack, but we will knuckle down to playing them this week.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Retiring captain Rory Best paid an emotional tribute to Ireland\u00a0after a clinical performance from New Zealand\u00a0ended their World Cup dream in Tokyo.
