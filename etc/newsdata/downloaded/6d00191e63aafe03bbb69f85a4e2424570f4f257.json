It has been liked 29,000 times.\n\nEngland will presumably consider it money well spent given the tone it set and the adrenaline it pumped through their veins.

We meant no offence by it, we just wanted to let them know that we were ready for the challenge ahead.\u201d\n\nReferee Nigel Owens had to warn Joe Marler to move back in order that the men in black could perform the famous Maori war-dance.
