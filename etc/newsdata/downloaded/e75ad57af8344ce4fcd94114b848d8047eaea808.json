What is interesting is that there is something similar happening out in the states. For example, in, of all places, Texas. From the Houston Chronicle:\n\nHis decision to not run for re-election puts GOP control of that seat in peril. Incumbents typically enjoy an upper hand in re-election bids, generally in better name recognition and stronger fundraising. Democrats have targeted his district as they try to take control of the Texas House. Political operatives from either party have identified more than two dozen House seats that are flippable in the greater Houston and Dallas areas: 11 in the greater Houston area, 16 in the DFW Metroplex.\n\nDemocrats need to win nine seats to make up a majority of the 150-member House, which would break up decades of Republican dominance in Austin. The stakes are high \u2014 the party that controls the House in 2021 will wield influence when the Legislature redraws Congressional and state district boundaries following next year\u2019s census.\n\nTexas, of course, has been ground zero for Republican congressional retirements; that state legislators are taking the same route back to the private sector might indicate that the president* has poisoned the Republican brand all the way down to the taproot. Texas Democrats need to flip nine seats to control the Texas House, and this state representative, Dwayne Bohac, opted out of facing two Democratic challengers.\n\nPhoto credit: Mark Humphrey/AP/Shutterstock More\n\nWe move along to Tennessee, the government of which seems bound and determined to out-Mississippi Mississippi. The state is presently setting taxpayer dollars on fire defending one of those nakedly unconstitutional Waiting-For-Justice-Boof anti-choice laws. (Texas, it should be noted, already has spent $2.5 million defending an even worse pile of dreck.) Anyway, the Tennessee law under challenge requires a 48-hour waiting period for women seeking to exercise their right to choose. This is, of course, paternalism run amok. There are only seven clinics left operating in Tennessee. From the Courthouse News Service:\n\nAfter anti-abortion activists bought the building in a bankruptcy sale and shut the clinic down in 1993, they demolished a portion of the building where abortions were performed and, inspired by an account in the Old Testament, placed a limestone boulder \u2013 an Ebenezer stone \u2013 to commemorate a victory they believe came about only with God\u2019s assistance. Today, if a woman in Chattanooga seeks an abortion, she must drive about two hours to Knoxville or Nashville, Atlanta, Georgia or Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nChattanooga is one of 27 cities in the country termed an \u201cabortion desert\u201d by a 2018 study published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, a city where a woman seeking to terminate a pregnancy has to drive more than 100 miles to the nearest abortion clinic. The distance some women have to drive for an abortion is the reason why abortion clinics in the state are challenging a Tennessee law in federal court requiring women to wait 48-hours between an initial, in-person consultation with an abortion provider and the actual procedure.", "description": "Even state legislators in Texas are running for the hills.", "authors": ["Charles P.
