It is also a \u201cstrikingly\u201d persistent gap, having narrowed less over the past quarter-century than the pay disparity between genders.\n\n\u201cThe ethnicity pay gap problem in the UK is every bit as acute as the gender pay gap problem,\u201d Mr Haldane said.\n\nHe went on to argue for compulsory reporting of ethnicity pay gaps, drawing a parallel with the existing obligation on UK companies with 250 employees or more to reveal their gender pay gap.\n\nThe adjusted data also points to large variations between different ethnic groups. While mixed race workers earn 2 per cent more than their white peers, all other ethnic minorities earn less, ranging from 20 per cent less for people of Bangladeshi origin to 6 per cent less for workers of a Chinese background.\n\nThe analysis emphasises the importance of looking at each group separately, rather than necessarily treating ethnic minorities as a single cohort, Mr Haldane said.\n\nWhile adjusting the raw data for the various characteristics helps explain a large part of the pay gap, it does not mean that part of the gap is justified, he noted.\n\n\u201cFor example, consistent and large education and skills differences between cohorts could themselves be taken as evidence of a policy failure. So too might a preponderance of certain [worker] types in certain industries or occupations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn other cases the choice of an occupation or sector may be a personal decision, reflecting lifestyle and values, and less obviously a market failure or policy concern.\u201d", "description": "Ethnic minorities in the UK earn around 10 per cent less than white workers, even once individual and job characteristics are taken into account, the Bank of England has found.
