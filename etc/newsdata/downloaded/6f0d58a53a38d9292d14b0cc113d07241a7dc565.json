The safety board also said the same problem could affect other passenger planes beyond the Max, and recommended that the FAA address such shortcomings broadly.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting all these different alerts. That\u2019s the actual scenario that never got evaluated in the simulator,\u201d said Dana Schulze, director of the NTSB\u2019s Office of Aviation Safety.\n\nThe FAA should require that safety assessments consider the effect of multiple alerts, she said, adding, \u201cClearly, if the underlying process has a deficiency, it\u2019s going to affect more than just potentially one aircraft.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re not saying is that there\u2019s broadly a safety issue in all these airplanes. We\u2019re saying, \u2018This is an opportunity to improve the process to ensure that the human aspect is considered,\u2019 \u201d Schulze said.\n\nThe two crashes killed 346 people and left the management and safety practices of both Boeing and the FAA under intense scrutiny and the subject of numerous inquiries. The company and regulator have both said they followed the same safety practices for the Max that have for years produced trustworthy airplanes.\n\nBoeing declined to answer questions about the NTSB findings, and was noncommittal about what actions it will take to address them, saying it will work with the FAA to review the recommendations. \u201cThe safety of our airplanes, our customers\u2019 passengers and crews is always our top priority,\u201d the company said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe company\u2019s board of directors on Wednesday recommended a number of actions to \u201cbolster the safety policies and procedures\u201d of the company. They included the creation of a \u201cProduct and Services Safety organization\u201d that would report to senior company leaders and would review \u201call aspects of product safety, including investigating cases of undue pressure and anonymous product and service safety concerns raised by employees.\u201d\n\nBoeing\u2019s board also recommended that the company \u201cre-examine assumptions around flight deck design and operation . . . to anticipate the needs of the changing demographics and future pilot populations.\u201d And it called for more pilot training where needed.\n\nThe FAA said in a statement that it appreciates the recommendations, which it will review, and that the agency is \u201ccommitted to a philosophy of continuous improvement.\u201d Lessons learned from crashes \u201cwill be a springboard to an even greater level of safety,\u201d it said.\n\nThe NTSB is participating in ongoing investigations of the two crashes led by aviation authorities in Jakarta and Addis Ababa. NTSB investigators delayed making other recommendations until those inquiries are completed, leaving many key questions unaddressed for now.\n\nThe safety board, for instance, did not publicly describe which Boeing failures led to the design and sale of the automated feature implicated in both crashes, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). The feature was designed to work based on data from a single sensor, and was given the power to push the plane\u2019s nose down, again and again, which essentially overpowered pilots who struggled to regain control before the Indonesia and Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia crashes.\n\nNor did the NTSB recommend how Boeing should fix flaws in its operations or how the FAA might reform its controversial Organization Designation Authorization program, which gives Boeing broad power to oversee its own safety. And the NTSB investigators, Schulze said, did not \u201caddress specific issues looking at the pilot performance in these particular accidents.\u201d\n\nLong before the Max disasters, Boeing had a history of failing to fix safety problems\n\nBut the safety board outlined several concerns about \u201chuman factors,\u201d a broad area that covers the interface of person and machine.\n\n\u201cThe lessons of the past need to be plowed into the designs of the future,\u201d said Evan Byrne, who heads the NTSB\u2019s Human Performance and Survival Factors division focused on aviation safety. \u201cThis isn\u2019t necessarily a new airplane problem. The concept of saturation, in terms of alarms, warnings and crews maybe going down the wrong path for troubleshooting, has occurred with very simple airplanes. Research at NASA shows that crew response to abnormal situations can not be perfect.\u201d\n\nByrne said the goal now is to take what has been learned in crashes regarding \u201chow pilots actually perform\u201d and make sure those lessons are reflected in the way airplanes are certified in the future.\n\nNTSB officials said Boeing made assumptions in its safety analysis of a potential failure of the MCAS system that proved off base.\n\n\u201cEvery design you need to make assumptions, but you want to validate that that\u2019s going to work,\u201d Schulze said.\n\nIn building its original safety assessment for the Max, Boeing had assumed that \u201cthe pilots would immediately identify\u201d that the plane was being pushed downward without their input, she said.\n\nBoeing also assumed that \u201cafter immediately identifying these control forces, they would immediately take action,\u201d and if problems persisted, they would resort to an existing emergency checklist on how to deal with a \u201crunaway\u201d horizontal stabilizer on the plane\u2019s tail, which makes the aircraft climb or descend, Schulze said.\n\nBut Schulze said that when NTSB investigators delved into the details, they found that Boeing\u2019s assumptions did not reflect the type of failure that eventually occurred with MCAS.\n\nWhen Boeing had test pilots face an \u201cunintended MCAS activation,\u201d the simulator pushed the plane\u2019s nose down by 2.5 degrees at a certain speed, she said. The pilots were able to handle that situation safely.\n\nWith its ties in Washington, Boeing has taken over more and more of the FAA\u2019s job\n\nBut in Indonesia and Ethiopia, there was \u201ca deeper failure\u201d \u2014 an external probe provided faulty information to MCAS. That added to the series of competing alerts, even as MCAS repeatedly pushed the nose down. And Boeing \u201cdid not look at all the potential flight deck alerts and indications the pilots might face when this specific failure\u201d happened, she said.\n\nIn comments to Congress earlier this year, Capt. Chesley B. \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger III said he thought it was \u201cunlikely that other crews would have had very different experiences or performed very differently than these crews did on their accident flights. . . . I can tell you firsthand that the startle factor is real, and huge.\u201d\n\nThe NTSB made seven recommendations Thursday to address certification and safety issues, and investigators expect to add more later. They called on the FAA to:\n\n\u25cfGuarantee that Boeing has reexamined certain safety assessments for the Max. In cases where the company \u201cassumed immediate and appropriate pilot corrective actions\u201d in response to \u201cuncommanded\u201d movements of the plane, the FAA should ensure that Boeing \u201cconsider the effect of all possible flight deck alerts and indications on pilot recognition and response.\u201d\n\nBoeing also should be required to \u201cincorporate design enhancements (including flight deck alerts and indications), pilot procedures, and/or training requirements, where needed, to minimize the potential for and safety impact of pilot actions that are inconsistent with manufacturer assumptions,\u201d the NTSB said.\n\n\u25cfRequire that similar reassessments and improvements be done on most other passenger planes.\n\n\u25cfNotify international authorities that they should consider the same issues.\n\n\u25cfDevelop \u201crobust tools and methods\u201d for \u201cvalidating assumptions\u201d used during the certification process, specifically assumptions on how pilots will handle dangerous failures of airplanes\u2019 systems.\n\n\u25cf Revise FAA regulations and guidance to use those new tools for certifying the design of airplanes, and to reexamine the \u201cvalidity\u201d of assumptions the FAA allows regarding how pilots will recognize and respond to problems.\n\n\u25cfDevelop design standards, with help from experts and industry, for diagnostic tools that will improve the \u201cprioritization and clarity\u201d of the various warnings and indications pilots are subjected to, with an eye toward improving the \u201ctimeliness and effectiveness\u201d of their response.\n\n\u25cfRequire that those diagnostic tools are installed on passenger planes to help pilots better deal with multiple alerts.", "description": "Investigators call on FAA to examine how multiple alerts can impact most passenger aircraft, among other recommendations.", "authors": ["Michael Laris", "Transportation Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lTF_ns2qrXCWbUbUJayMQqhCHwo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EOAF2KG764I6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
