Rihanna flashes a grin that is somehow both reassuring and mischievous. \"Aren\u2019t we all?\" she says.'\n\nShe also explains that the interview had been bumped up a day, and then bumped up from evening to afternoon just minutes before she had to meet the star. She had just enough time to shower and change her clothes before meeting Rihanna.\n\nRihanna's fans, though, were stunned that she turned up unprepared. They slammed Aguirre as 'disrespectful' and 'unprofessional.'\n\nWhat? Fans \u2014 including dozens of writers and journalists \u2014 criticized her for coming unprepared\n\n'How you gon\u2019 show up to interview RIHANNA with NO questions prepared? The disrespect,' wrote film and TV critic Rebecca Theodore-Vachon.\n\n'Can i just say as someone who gets interviewed a fair amount, it's immediately evident when the interviewer hasn't prepared, and depending on the context it's honestly kind of insulting. and i say this as, you know, Not Rihanna,' wrote author and sociologist Eve Ewing.\n\n'I can think of at least 10 million 8th grade students who would come more prepared and with more respect to an interview with Rihanna,' tweeted another.\n\n'You\u2019re wild if you not only aren\u2019t prepared to interview Rihanna, but then you INCLUDE THAT IN THE COVER STORY FOREVER IMMORTALIZING YOUR F*** UP,' said MTV News writer Trey Alston.\n\nSeveral pointed out that there are plenty of journalists who are obsessed with the star and would always be prepared to interview her on a moment's notice.\n\nThey'll do ti! Several said that they are always prepared, and a few complained of white privilege\n\n'Just to be clear: I stand ever-prepared to interview @rihanna on a second\u2019s notice,' wrote WBUR reporter Kimberly Atkins.\n\n'I'm prepared to interview Rihanna,' wrote Essence entertainment editor Joi-Marie.\n\n'I can\u2019t fathom being unprepared to interview Rihanna. Like haven\u2019t you prepared your whole life for her, or is that just me?' quipped Chicago Sun-Times reporter Jake Wittich.\n\n'I am prepared to interview Rihanna whenever. And I do mean prepared. I have a research file. I have questions,' author Roxane Gay chimed in.\n\nSeveral have argued that the unpreparedness is an example of white privilege.\n\n'Hey Rihanna, I've got an idea. Come to a Black publication. We're prepared and already went to Trader Joe's for the week,' wrote Essence podcast host Danielle Young.\n\n'I used to tell myself to have the confidence of a white man, but now I\u2019ll tell myself to have the confidence of the Vogue writer who admitted *to Rihanna* that they weren\u2019t prepared to interview her,' wrote Slide Stories App content creator Keryce Chelsi.\n\nDefense: Aguirre has responded, saying she was, in fact, prepared and had done research, but she didn't bring questions because the interview was last-minute\n\n'Imagine all of the @WritersofColor who would\u2019ve been more than prepared for an interview with Rihanna,' WNYC's Polly Irungu wrote.\n\nFor her part, Aguirre says she wasn't actually unprepared and had researched the star \u2014 she just didn't have questions written out.\n\n'GUYS. I was driving to Trader Joe's in sweatpants when I got the call and literally had to flip a b****. I research my subjects to death. *Especially* Rihanna,' she tweeted.\n\n'I appreciate the anger behind the reaction. But this is a misunderstanding, for which I take full responsibility.\n\n'I had literally no notice. The point was to convey how nerve-wracking this was, given my deep, bordering-on-psychotic reverence for Rihanna.\n\n'If you had accused me of eating too much Mexican food, I would take that personally. Because it's true. But you can't accuse me of not doing research. Ask anyone I have ever worked with. Ever,' she added.\n\nAguirre has written quite a few major celebrity profiles for Vogue, including for Priyanka Chopra, RuPaul, Kamala Harris, Issa Rae, Gina Rodriguez, and Amandla Stenberg\n\nShe has also written recent cover stories about Taylor Swift and Zendaya.\n\nWhat's more, this wasn't her first time interviewing Rihanna: She also wrote a profile of the singer for Vogue's April 2017 cover.", "description": "The singer was interviewed by\u00a0Abby Aguirre, who  admitted in the story that she normally brings questions to an interview but didn't have time to prepare one this time.", "authors": ["Carly Stern For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/19544274-0-image-a-37_1570718492791.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
