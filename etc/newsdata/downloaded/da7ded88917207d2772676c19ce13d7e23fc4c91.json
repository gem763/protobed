Indeed, his Brussels-based think tank\u2014known simply as the Movement\u2014has largely been a stillborn effort, stymied by limited buy-in from European partners, as well as stringent laws barring financial contributions from foreign sources. A separate effort to establish a so-called alt-right academy to train the next generation of nationalist populist leaders faced its own challenges this week when the school was barred from the ancient Italian monastery in which it was to be housed.\n\nBut perhaps the greatest inhibitor of Bannon\u2019s success in Europe has been the very far-right parties he has professed to support. Though the former Donald Trump strategist has appeared alongside some of Europe\u2019s most high-profile far-right leaders\u2014from Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Rally in France, to Matteo Salvini, the head of the League and Italy\u2019s erstwhile interior minister\u2014few have agreed to unite under his nationalist banner. The Sweden Democrats expressed \u201cno interest\u201d in Bannon\u2019s project. Vlaams Belang, a Flemish nationalist party, called the effort \u201cpoorly organized.\u201d The Alternative for Germany said the interests of Europe\u2019s anti-establishment parties are too \u201cdivergent\u201d to be united.\n\nRead: Why Trump turned on Steve Bannon\n\nThe most common refrain among those skeptical of Bannon\u2019s plans is that he simply isn\u2019t European. In their eyes, \u201che remains an American,\u201d Jean-Yves Camus, a French political scientist and a co-author of Far-Right Politics in Europe, told me. \u201cAnd you have to remember that several parties on the extreme right of the political spectrum are pretty much anti-American. They always criticize U.S. imperialism and U.S. foreign policy.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Bannon\u2019s Americanness that makes some European nationalist parties resistant to working with him. Their reluctance also stems from what is perceived as a fundamental misunderstanding of the way these parties work. Though many of Europe\u2019s far-right movements are united in their shared views on immigration, the economy, and the role and future of the European Union, these beliefs don\u2019t always manifest themselves in the same political goals. Despite hopes that they would be a dominant force in the European Parliament after elections this May, right-wing populist parties instead had to settle for forming the fifth-largest grouping in the legislature\u2014their national priorities took precedence over any broader project. (The current far-right grouping, led by Salvini, failed, for example, to persuade Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz to join it.)\n\n\u201cYou simply cannot build an alliance of all the mainstream right-[wing] conservative and extreme-right political parties,\u201d Camus said. \u201cYou cannot have Orb\u00e1n and Salvini and Le Pen and so on sitting on the same bench.\u201d", "description": "The former Trump strategist has spent the past year trying to bolster far-right parties on the Continent\u2014with little to show for it.", "authors": ["Yasmeen Serhan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX6HP9S/facebook.jpg?1570821839", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
