But it doesn\u2019t count as a world record.\n\nUpdated at 2:15 p.m. ET on October 13, 2019.\n\nEarly yesterday morning, in a misty park in Vienna, Eliud Kipchoge ran a marathon in less than two hours. His time, 1:59:40, is the fastest any runner has ever covered 26.2 miles. Kipchoge carved two minutes off his own world record and became the first marathoner to break the two-hour barrier.\n\nAt the event, branded the INEOS 1:59 Challenge, the performance was heralded as a radical, historic leap, his \u201cNeil Armstrong moment,\u201d as one announcer said. Indeed, Kipchoge himself\u2014a soft-spoken 34-year-old Kenyan who dulls the pain of distance running by smiling mid-competition\u2014has repeatedly equated his feat to reaching the moon. That comparison is audacious on the scale of human achievement, but in the galaxy of running, it might actually be an understatement.
