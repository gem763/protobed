Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh made the finance team use irregular accounting practices to shore up profits has stirred up things again at the once-beleaguered firm.\n\nThe letter addressed to the Infosys board and published by the Deccan Herald newspaper charged Parekh of \u201cunethical practices\u201d in recent quarters to boost \u201cshort term revenues and profits,\u201d the whistleblowers wrote in a note titled \u201cDisturbing unethical practices.\u201d The note signed \u201cEthical Employees\u201d asked the board to investigate and take immediate action.

Infosys\u2019s shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange were down 12% in early trading following the company\u2019s statement.\n\nThe complaint dated Sept. 20 is the latest in a series of whistleblower complaints that wrought havoc at Asia\u2019s second-most valuable IT services firm leading to the exit of its previous CEO Vishal Sikka after a confrontation with co-founder Narayana Murthy. The new complaint does not augur well for the company, which appeared to be recovering from Sikka\u2019s departure by raising growth projections to 9% to 10% for this financial year versus 8.5% to 10% previously. Chairman and co-founder Nandan Nilekani proclaimed last year that Infosys had become \u201cboring again.\u201d\n\nInfosys and its peers like Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. build software and provide services to some of the world\u2019s largest banks and retailers.
