He therefore intends to defend himself vigorously,' they added.\n\nWinterkorn was at the controls from 2007 to 2015, stepping down soon after the scandal broke.\n\nIn April, he was charged with serious fraud, unfair competition and breach of trust by prosecutors in Brunswick, alongside four other suspects.\n\nHis lawyers reiterated that he is 'blameless in this matter' and 'will continue defending himself'.\n\nMeanwhile, Poetsch's lawyers also said he was 'blameless'.\n\nThe dieselgate scandal shook Volkswagen to its foundations, and with it Germany's flagship car sector, a pillar of the economy that employs around 800,000 people.\n\nIt has cost VW alone more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in fines, legal costs and compensation payments to car owners - the vast majority in the United States.\n\nAt home, Audi, Porsche and the Volkswagen brand have paid a total of 2.3 billion euros in fines for negligence in failing to stop the cheating - the only way to punish the companies themselves in German law.\n\nStill on the boil are multiple inquiries looking to determine who within the companies was responsible for the cheating.\n\nBrunswick prosecutors' probe has had almost 40 people in its sights.\n\nShareholders have launched a massive joint lawsuit demanding nine billion euros of damages, while some 400,000 drivers' cases have been bundled into a trial that will begin on September 30.", "description": "Prosecutors accuse Herbert Diess and Hans Dieter Poetsch of failing to tell shareholders of billions of dollars in liabilities that Volkswagen was facing because of the scandal, affecting the share price.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/24/16/18874812-0-image-a-83_1569337502578.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
