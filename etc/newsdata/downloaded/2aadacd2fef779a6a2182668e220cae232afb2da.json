Mandatory Credit: Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSan Francisco 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman admitted that Baker Mayfield deserves an apology following his erroneous claim that the Cleveland Browns quarterback snubbed him prior to a pregame coin toss.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely my bad,\u201d Sherman said on The Pat McAfee Show on Wednesday. \u201cI never want anybody to deal with some (expletive) that \u2014 I mean some, some stuff that they didn\u2019t do. And so, you know, the questions that he\u2019s gonna get and the annoying, nonsense questions about some stuff that happened in a game that\u2019s already been done, you know, sure he\u2019ll get an apology for that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably reach out to him via text or social media to actually get ahold of him and talk to him in person, I mean on the phone. But, yeah, because that (stinks) ... But yeah, yeah. He definitely deserves an apology, and my bad on that.\u201d\n\nSherman started the handshake flap with his comments after the 49ers breezed to a 31-3 win over the Browns on Monday.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing, and annoying, was him not shaking hands at the beginning,\u201d the 31-year-old Sherman told NFL.com\u2019s Mike Silver on Monday night. \u201cThat\u2019s some college (expletive). It\u2019s ridiculous. We\u2019re all trying to get psyched up, but shaking hands with your opponent \u2014 that\u2019s NFL etiquette. And when you pull bush league stuff, that\u2019s disrespectful to the game. And believe me, that\u2019s gonna get us fired up.\u201d\n\nSherman remained fired up on the matter before issuing an apology that came on the heels of video depicting Mayfield providing physical acknowledgment with the cornerback prior to Monday\u2019s game.\n\nAlthough he said Mayfield was owed an apology, Sherman maintained that he felt disrespected by the quarterback.\n\n\u201cI may have phrased it differently, but I meant what I said,\u201d Sherman said on Wednesday. \u201cI did feel the disrespect. ... I felt disrespect and at the end of the day that\u2019s all the story was, really. Like, people can say, \u2018Oh my God, he shook your hand\u2019 or \u2018Oh my God you were wrong.\u2019 You can say whatever you want. I don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Field Level Media", "description": "San Francisco 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman admitted that Baker Mayfield deserves an apology following his erroneous claim that the Cleveland Browns quarterback snubbed him prior to a pregame coin toss.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438907173&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981MS-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
