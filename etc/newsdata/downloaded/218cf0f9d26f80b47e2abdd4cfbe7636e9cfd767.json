Overall, dollar index speculative positions have risen for seven out of the past ten weeks and maintain their bullish standing right around the +30,000 net contract level.\n\nIndividual Currencies Data this week:\n\nIn the other major currency contracts data, we saw only one substantial change (+ or \u2013 10,000 contracts) in the speculators category this week.\n\nMexican peso speculator positions fell sharply this week by over -17,000 contracts and declined for a fourth consecutive week. Peso positions have been one of the only currencies with positive speculator positions this year and reached an all-time record high bullish position on April 16th. Since then, bullish positions have been faltering and are now under the +100,000 net contract level for the first time since March 12th.\n\nOverall, the major currencies that saw improving speculator positions this week were the (398 weekly change in contracts), British pound sterling (3,390 contracts), Japanese yen (2,453 contracts), Swiss franc (7,317 contracts) and the Australian dollar (1,749 contracts).\n\nThe currencies whose speculative bets declined this week were the euro (-827 weekly change in contracts), Canadian dollar (-2,132 contracts), New Zealand dollar (-7,787 contracts) and the Mexican peso (-17,045 contracts).\n\nOther Notables for the week:\n\nJapanese yen speculator positions continued to rise and have now improved for six straight weeks. The yen has risen by a total of +44,987 contracts in just these past six weeks as bets have now been in bullish territory for four weeks. The improved yen level marks the best standing since November 1st of 2016.\n\nSwiss franc positions rose for a third straight week this week. The franc positions are now just barely in bearish territory (-3,800 contracts) and this marks the least bearish level since November 3rd of 2017 (a span of 99 weeks). Franc positions reached their most bearish level of the year on May 14th at -40,010 net contracts and have improved consistently since then as the franc benefits from risk off market themes (similar to the Japanese yen).\n\nChart: Current Strength of Each Currency compared to their 3-Year Range\n\nCurrent Strength Of Each Currency\n\nSee the table and individual currency charts below.\n\nTable of Large Speculator Levels & Weekly Changes:\n\nTable Of Large Speculator Levels & Weekly Changes\n\nThis latest COT data is through Tuesday and shows a quick view of how large speculators or non-commercials (for-profit traders) were positioned in the futures markets.
