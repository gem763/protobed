And they raise additional questions about the degree to which senior officials throughout the Trump administration were involved in\u2014or privy to\u2014attempts by the president to muddy a top potential political opponent.\n\nOver the course of the past year, Giuliani has participated in a far-flung campaign by Trump allies to unearth damaging information about Biden and his son Hunter. As part of that effort, Giuliani pressed the Ukrainian government to investigate so-far unfounded allegations of corruption in the country involving the Bidens. At the time, Hunter Biden was accused of using his father\u2019s political standing to secure lucrative business opportunities abroad. Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general would subsequently say he had no evidence of any wrongdoing.\n\nThis summer, Giuliani briefed U.S. diplomats, including special representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker, on his work in Ukraine and his efforts to convince the administration of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. But Giuliani confirmed to The Daily Beast that he also briefed another diplomat: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. President Trump\u2019s lawyer said that he briefed both Volker (who he referred to as the \u201cmain one\u201d in terms of his State contacts) and Sondland on multiple conference calls earlier this year about his progress in pursuing a Ukraine investigation.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly an unknown topic for Sondland. The ambassador was also closely involved with the Trump phone call to Zelensky in which Trump repeatedly pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cI spoke with both of them before and after this conversation,\u201d Sondland told Ukraine\u2019s state-run news agency after the phone call. \u201cThe conversation was very successful. They found a common language immediately.\u201d The two leaders discussed Ukraine\u2019s civil war, energy security, and \u201cthe rule of law,\u201d Sondland said in July.\n\nThat same day, Zelensky met with both Sondland and Volker to discuss Ukraine\u2019s war with pro-Russian rebels. It was a particularly poignant topic at the time; the U.S. was holding back on nearly $400 million worth of equipment promised to Kyiv to deter Moscow and her allies.\n\nNot Just Ukraine: Rudy and Bannon Try a Whole New Way to Slime Biden\n\nWhile Giuliani has said publicly that his overtures to the Ukrainians were brokered in part by the State Department, the specifics of his contacts with Foggy Bottom have remained opaque\u2014including what, if anything, Secretary Mike Pompeo knew about the Ukraine work. According to two sources inside the department, U.S. diplomats, including Sondland and Volker, were aware of the details Giuliani\u2019s work in Ukraine on Biden as early as this spring. Those sources said senior officials at the department were read in on Giuliani\u2019s calls with Volker and Sondland.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Kurt Volker the most about this, but have been on conference calls with [Sondland],.\u201d Giuliani said. Giuliani also claimed that he had not been asked to be put in touch with Sondland, but one day unexpectedly found himself \u201con a conference call with him\u201d to discuss the Ukraine efforts.\n\nThey weren\u2019t the only senior members of the Trump administration brought into the president\u2019s efforts to use a foreign government to squeeze a political foe. According to the Washington Post, Trump ordered Mick Mulvaney, his acting chief of staff and director of the Office of Management and Budget, to hit pause on hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid for Ukraine\u2014just days before a now-infamous July phone call between Trump and Zelensky. Mulvaney\u2019s OMB deputies then directed officials Departments of Defense and State not to distribute the military aid.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s work on Ukraine began months earlier. The Trump attorney\u2019s work, done with the president\u2019s explicit blessing, involved chasing leads on possible origins of the Mueller investigation. It eventually led to his attempts to dig up dirt on the Biden family. This was all happening as Trump was preparing to head into a presidential election year, with Trump and his advisers viewing Biden, the 2020 Democratic frontrunner, as a prominent political enemy.", "description": "Alex WongRudy Giuliani\u2019s contacts with officials at the State Department as part of his controversial efforts to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine are more extensive than have been publicly reported.
