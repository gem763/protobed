The NHS guidance for getting your baby to latch onto your breast is as follows: Hold your baby close to you with their nose level with the nipple.\n\nWait until your baby opens their mouth really wide with their tongue down. You can encourage them to do this by gently stroking their top lip.\n\nBring your baby on to your breast.\n\nYour baby will tilt their head back and come to your breast chin first. Remember to support your baby's neck but not hold the back of their head. They should then be able to take a large mouthful of breast. Your nipple should go towards the roof of their mouth.\n\nTo learn more, the team analysed 46,616 children who took part in the Longitudinal Survey of Newborns in the 21st Century.\n\nQuestionnaires were sent to the parents of all babies born in Japan between January 10 and 17 or July 10 and 17, 2001.\n\nThe infants were then divided into three groups according to how they were fed; exclusive breast feeding, partial breast feeding including the colostrum, and formula only.\n\nColostrum is the fluid a new mother's breasts produce in the first few days. It is a very concentrated feed, rich in protein, immune-fighting substances, antioxidants and 'good bacteria'.\n\nThe babies were assessed for allergy-related hospital visits between six months old and either 18 months or five-and-a-half.\n\nResults showed the babies who did not have eczema and were exclusively breastfed were more than twice as likely to be treated for a food allergy.\n\nThis is compared to the infants were only given formula.\n\nAmong the infants who were partially breastfed, only those with eczema were protected against a food allergy, with their risk going down by 36 per cent.\n\nAlthough unclear, breastfeeding may protect babies with eczema via the 'dual allergen exposure hypothesis'.\n\nThis states food allergies come about due to an imbalance between skin sensitisation and 'oral tolerance'.\n\nBabies with this imbalance due to skin barrier dysfunction may benefit from breastfeeding to maintain their oral tolerance, the scientists wrote.\n\nA mother's breast milk, particularly the colostrum, contains many substances that strengthen an infant's immune system against allergies.\n\nWhy babies without eczema who are exclusively breastfed do not benefit is less clear.\n\nThe scientists speculate it may be due to 'delayed food introduction'. One study showed, for example, babies who are given cow's milk 'early' are less likely to be allergic to it.\n\nThe team stress, however, they did not collect information on when the infants started on solid food. Future research is therefore required to confirm this.\n\nClare Livingstone, professional policy advisor at the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), said: 'This is interesting research and it will add to the information mothers will be able use when they make decisions about how they feed their baby.\n\n'It is important to stress the huge weight of evidence about the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the mother.\n\n'Benefits for the baby include a reduced risk of infections, sudden infant death syndrome and obesity. Many of the benefits also have effects well into adulthood.\n\n'For the mother breastfeeding is linked to a lower risk of some cancers and osteoporosis among other benefits.\n\n'Whatever way a woman chooses to feed her baby be it breastfeeding, formula feeding or a combination of both the RCM supports that choice.'", "description": "Scientists from Okayama University in Japan analysed more than 46,000 babies.
