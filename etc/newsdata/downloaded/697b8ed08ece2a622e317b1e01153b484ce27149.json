The new library has a refreshed visual look, intended to make it easier to find your games, see what your friends are playing, and follow news and updates from the games in your library. (You might have to relaunch your Steam client once or twice to get the update.)\n\nHere\u2019s one image of what it looks like in practice:\n\nI think the \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d section could be a particularly useful new feature \u2014 it seems like a handy way to quickly see updates about games I already have. Developers can post updates to this What\u2019s New section, as well as to a game\u2019s community hub and store page, using a new tool that Valve is calling \u201cevents.\u201d\n\nYou can also see which friends are currently playing a game at a glance \u2014 take a look at that little friends icon beneath PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds in the image above.\n\nWith today\u2019s update, Valve is also expanding the Remote Play Together Beta, which launched earlier this month to let you play local multiplayer games with your friends over the internet, to all Steam users.", "description": "In September, Valve launched a beta for a redesigned Steam library, and today, the company said that redesign is available for everyone.
