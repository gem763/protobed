My path to abroad doesn't succeed. Mom, I love you so much! I'm dying because I can't breathe,\" she said in the message confirmed by her brother Pham Manh Cuong.\n\nTheir home province of Ha Tinh was devastated by a massive fish kill in 2016 when a Taiwanese steel firm dumped toxic wasted into the ocean.\n\nMigrants can pay smugglers up to $40,000 for the dangerous journey, an enormous sum in Vietnam, where the annual per capital income is around $2,400, according to the World Bank.\n\n- 'Vulnerable people' -\n\nThe truck's driver is due in court on Monday.\n\nAmong the suspects still in custody is a 38-year-old woman reported to be the registered owner of the truck, and her husband, also 38. They denied any involvement, according to media reports.\n\n\"We've got to be realistic. We know that... we have people coming into the country, either being trafficked or as asylum seekers,\" British police Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore told reporters earlier Saturday.\n\n\"It must be clear that criminals -- and that's what we're dealing with, criminals, murderers -- are taking more and more chances with these vulnerable people,\" he added.\n\nHe appealed to the Vietnamese community in Britain for information, saying his force would take no action against anyone here illegally who came forward to claim a friend or relative.\n\nPasmore said he had discussed with Vietnam's ambassador how to fast-track the process of fingerprint identification and DNA testing, but said identification would take time.", "description": "British police investigating the deaths of 39 people in a refrigerated truck charged the driver on Saturday with manslaughter and people trafficking, as families in Vietnam expressed fear their loved ones were among the dead.
