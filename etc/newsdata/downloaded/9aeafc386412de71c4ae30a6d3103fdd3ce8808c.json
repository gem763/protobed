But as of Tuesday morning, the rescuers have found no signs of life with detecting equipment at the scene.\n\nLuo Songjun, captain of Hechi Squadron of Guangxi Mine Rescue Brigade, said the rescue is full of challenges as the collapse site is about 3.7 kilometers deep in the ground and the temperature reaches up to 42 C, according to the report of Nanguo Morning News.\n\nQingda Xiyuan Mine Investment Co Ltd, the alleged mineral enterprise, was found trying to cover up the accident since it was later confirmed to have occurred at 6:30 pm on Monday instead of Tuesday morning when the family of the victims, who were miners, reported the event to the local police, said the local government on Tuesday. Even worse, the mineral enterprise also intended to hide the remains of the underground miners as well as the production records on Monday.\n\nThe cause of the accident is under investigation.", "description": "A roof collapse at a mine on Monday has left two dead and nine still trapped there in Nandan county, Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, according to the local authority.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db92837a310cf3e97a38dbd.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
