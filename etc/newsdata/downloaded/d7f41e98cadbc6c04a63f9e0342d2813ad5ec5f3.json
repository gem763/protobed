Australian Embassy\n\nYet the political balancing act is, if anything, even more tricky when it comes to companies doing business with China. The bottom line risk of causing offence \u2013 including via the casual use of social media \u2013 is becoming increasingly obvious to all commercial enterprises.\n\nThe Australian government may have led the way on economic tension when it banned China\u2019s telco equipment giant Huawei from any participation in the roll out of the 5G network. The US then went much further with the Trump administration\u2019s decision to block US companies from supplying goods and services to Huawei and, more recently, to other Chinese tech companies accused of being involved in abuse of human rights.\n\nChina\u2019s main concern over the blocking of Huawei in the Australian 5G market was more the risk it could become the model for countries like the UK and western Europe. With the UK government so preoccupied by Brexit, there\u2019s still no official decision, but British telco operators have largely pre-empted this in practice by proceeding to use Huawei in the absence of an official ban. Despite US pressure, Germany also officially announced last week that Huawei was allowed to participate in 5G, making it likely the rest of the EU will follow.\n\nThe US ban has been more commercially potent, undermining the appeal of Huawei\u2019s mobile phone business in Western markets because it prevents the company pre-loading apps like Google maps or Facebook. No one can be confident about what and whether Donald Trump might concede on Huawei if he wants a trade deal badly enough.\n\nBut it is already clear that economic retaliation can go both ways \u2013 in areas extending well beyond security concerns over technology or the US China trade war and the imposition of government tariffs on most of each other\u2019s exports.\n\nSo commercial US powerhouses from the National Basketball Asssociation to Apple have been recently reminded of the bottom line cost of offending Chinese sensitivities \u2013 with the latest flashpoint being Hong Kong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust one tweet in favour of the Hong Kong demonstrations by the Houston Rockets general manager was enough to immediately inflame antagonism against the NBA across China. Smartphone maker Vivo and China\u2019s major travel booking platform Ctrip.com suspended sponsorship arrangements, while Chinese broadcaster CCTV and internet giant TenCent stopped showing NBA games.\n\nNBA\u2019s apology reflected the reality that more than 600 million viewers in China watching NBA games with major growth expected from that market.\n\nApple has regularly manoeuvred its way through the intricacies of Chinese regulation and censorship in a country that, along with Hong Kong and Taiwan, accounts for more than one quarter of its profits. It quickly withdrew an app that allowed users to track protest activities and police whereabouts in Hong Kong, releasing a statement saying the app \u201cviolated our guidelines and local laws\u201d.\n\nBut the reaction in the US \u2013 and Hong Kong \u2013 was also intense, with critics of both Apple and the NBA accusing both organisations of cravenly bowing to Chinese censorship to protect their own commercial interests.\n\nMost Australian businesses have so far been far less exposed despite mysterious customs delays for exports like Australian coal. China\u2019s demand for quality Australian resources, particularly iron ore, provides considerable protection as long as companies maintain a polite silence on controversial issues or, even better, press the government to improve its relationship with Beijing. A range of smaller companies are happily expanding into the Chinese consumer market while keeping their heads well down on delicate matters.\n\nBut the commercial threat remains potent, including for major Australian exports \u2013 like international education - that would be relatively easy for an aggrieved China to substitute.\n\nAustralian universities are clearly keen to avoid any political controversy given their reliance on Chinese students for fee income, much of it directed to research funding to climb up the global research rankings to attract yet more Chinese students.\n\nA delegation from the Group of Eight universities is visiting China this week to sign a memorandum of understanding with some of China\u2019s top research universities, with the aim of increasing cooperation and collaboration.\n\nThis is with the exception of research with security or military applications due to concerns about the significance of the research. Not that there is a simple dividing line, given dual-use technology. A joint university-government taskforce will recommend new guidelines for university collaboration with foreign powers.\n\nFor most businesses, the guidelines will be self imposed \u2013 but razor sharp.", "description": "The bottom line risk of causing offence to China is becoming increasingly obvious to all commercial enterprises in Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4564%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_73/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f4a9d6233f0bfafc0940f0933ef9422192edf8ce", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
