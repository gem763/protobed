In May, Trump scaled tariffs back to 25%.\n\n\u201cI am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path,\u201d the president said on Monday.\n\nErdo\u011fan was quoted as dismissing such threats as \u201cquips\u201d on Sunday, while the country\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva called a possible European Union arms embargo \u201ca joke.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish lira slid 0.8% to its weakest position since May on Monday, but many traders and investors said in effect they would believe it when they see it, especially after US threats earlier this year to sanction Turkey over buying Russian S-400 missile defences failed to materialise.\n\nTrump\u2019s statement also confirmed that all 1,000 US troops in north-eastern Syria are pulling out entirely, although they will \u201credeploy and remain in the region\u201d. It added that a \u201csmall footprint\u201d of US forces are staying in At Tanf Garrison in southern Syria \u201cto continue to disrupt remnants\u201d of the Islamic State.\n\nWho is in control in north-eastern Syria?\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil Turkey launched its offensive there on 9 October, the region was controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish.\n\nSince the Turkish incursion, the SDF has lost much of its territory and appears to be losing its grip on key cities. On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by Turkey and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.\n\nThat leaves north-eastern Syria divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF \u2013 for now.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did the SDF come to control the region?\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.\n\nIn late 2014, the Kurds were struggling to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobani, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does Turkey oppose the Kurds?\n\n\n\n\n\nFor years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside Turkey.", "description": "* President freezes negotiations on $100bn trade deal  * Trump vows to \u2018swiftly destroy Turkey\u2019s economy\u2019Turkish troops fire a heavy gun near Syria\u2019s northern city of Manbij.
