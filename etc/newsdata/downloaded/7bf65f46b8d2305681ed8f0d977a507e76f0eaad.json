Son Heung-min told reporters, \"Our opponents were too rough and even swore at us. I'm just glad we all got home without any major injuries.\" The Korea Football Association said some North Korean players \"shoved elbows and used their knees\" to attack South Korean players and added \"I've never seen that kind of football played before.\" Choi described the match as \"like a war.\"\n\nBefore that, the South Korean players had to endure harassment on arrival at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport. They were told to list every item in their bags, some having to rewrite their list several times when airport officials pointed out things they had missed. As a result, it took almost three hours for them to leave the airport to head to their hotel. The KFA had brought three boxes of meat and seafood to feed the players, but those were confiscated. The aim was obviously to tire the players and weaken them psychologically. They were prevented from leaving their hotel and were not even allowed to visit a gift shop in the lobby. When the time for the match finally came the stadium was completely empty surrounded by soldiers.\n\nThe source of their ordeal was a totalitarian regime under a little fat murderous dictator who is revered as a god in his basket case of a country. North Korea's national football team suffered a pathetic 0-6 loss against Qatar early this year, and it seems Kim Jong-un did not want to see something quite so humiliating on his own home turf, and more to the point did not want his people to see it. \"A defeat of the North Korean team would have been like rubbing shit on the leader's face,\" ex-North Korean diplomat Thae Yong-ho said. \"If South Korea had won, Son Heung-min would have had his legs broken or something.\"\n\nSport in North Korea is only a propaganda tool. \"I think a lot of people's lives were spared because the match ended in a tie,\" Thae said, meaning that the North Korean footballers were literally playing for their lives. This is hardly \"ping-pong diplomacy\" of the kind used to bring the U.S. and China closer during the Cold War, which showed that sports can be an excellent way to promote peace and dialogue. There are growing accusations around the world now that North Korea was violating the spirit of sport by implicating athletes in their politics, and calls for it to be punished. What can the South Korean government be thinking when it proposes to co-host the Olympics with North Korea? It should be banned from any sporting event until it cleans up its act.\n\nThe unification minister here mildly said he was \"disappointed\" by the match, but then tried to excuse the North by saying it probably wanted to be \"fair\" by preventing its people from watching the game since no South Korean spectators could be there. Not only did the government fail to protect the South Korean players from a nightmarish ordeal, it is now siding with the thugs who inflicted it. State-run broadcaster KBS decided not to broadcast even video footage of the match it received from the North.\n\nAn ethnic North Korean agency in Japan was in charge of negotiating live broadcast rights between South Korean media and the North's national football association. The North refused a live broadcast, but the South Korean broadcasters still ended up paying W300 million for a video edit that was of such bad quality that it could not be aired (US$1=W1,181). The footage must be shown, just so South Koreans can see for themselves what a miserable deal they got with the tacit support of their own government.\n\n", "description": "Gov't Is Complicit in N.Korean Thuggery Against Football Team", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
