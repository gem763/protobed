Special edition programmes were going for ten times their face value and the players were wearing a kit designed especially for the occasion, which included tracksuit tops with their names on the back \u2013 a nod to those synonymous with the Don Revie era.\n\nSome of those greats \u2013 Eddie Gray, Norman Hunter and Peter Lorimer - were presented to the crowd before kick-off along with those of a more recent vintage.\n\nBielsa was in his usual tracksuit - the same he wore to Leeds' black tie event on Thursday\n\nHoward Wilkinson and Gordon Strachan, manager and captain from the last champions of England, led a group of the squad from 1992 while Paul Robinson, Lucas Radebe and Danny Mills, represented the side that reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2001 under David O\u2019Leary.\n\nAll were warmly received by an Elland Road crowd eager to wallow in nostalgia before Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s men took to the stage.\n\nLeeds\u2019 Argentine manager was in his usual position perched on a bucket next to the dugout in his customary tracksuit. Just think, he had even worn that to the club\u2019s official black tie dinner on Thursday night!\n\nGoals have been a problem for Leeds on their own patch already this season with only four from their previous five league games, and it has cost them valuable points in the search for promotion as they struggled for a breakthrough again.\n\nEzgjan Alioski\u2019s early drive was beaten away by Birmingham goalkeeper Lee Camp, while striker Patrick Bamford shot across the face of goal after being released by Jack Harrison.\n\nBirmingham made a late charge but now sit 12th after just one win in five in the Championship\n\nDespite having four goals to his name this term, there remains the nagging doubt about Bamford that he is not prolific enough to take Leeds where they want to go.\n\nAnother excellent move then came to nothing as Helder Costa\u2019s goal-bound shot was blocked by centre half Marc Roberts, before Stuart Dallas followed up on the rebound and was denied by a smart save from Camp.\n\nThere was a positive response to the half-time stalemate by Bielsa as he introduced on-loan Arsenal forward Eddie Nketiah in place of Bamford.\n\nBut Blues, the only team to do the double over Leeds last season, continued to defend deep and hope for a sucker punch and it almost arrived when Fran Villalba took aim from 20 yards and whistled a strike just beyond Kiko Casilla\u2019s upright.\n\nBut the breakthrough arrived when the visitors were sloppy in possession as Harrison robbed Maxime Colin and made it into the area where Phillips arrived to drive home under Camp.\n\nThat released the tension in the stands and they really should have put the game to bed as more space opened up but Alioski was twice guilty of wasting great chances to do so.\n\nAs a result, they had to sweat all the way to the end and they breathed a sigh of relief when Kristian Pedersen\u2019s late header dropped wide, so the celebrations did not turn sour.", "description": "ADAM LANIGAN AT ELLAND ROAD: Leeds United celebrated turning 100 years old in a fitting manner by moving back into the Championship's automatic promotion spots.", "authors": ["Adam Lanigan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/18/19931328-0-image-a-32_1571505441405.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
