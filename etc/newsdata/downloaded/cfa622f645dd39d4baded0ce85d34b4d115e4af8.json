XRP price even broke the $0.2720 and $0.2750 resistance levels. Moreover, there was a break above the $0.2800 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Finally, the price tested the $0.2850 resistance area, where the bears took a stand. A high was formed at $0.2855 and recently the price started a downside correction.\n\nIt broke the $0.2800 and $0.2750 support levels. However, the $0.2720 area acted as a decent support. A low was formed near $0.2710 and the price is currently consolidating. It traded above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2855 high to $0.2710 low. However, it seems like the $0.2800 level is now acting as a solid barrier.\n\nAdditionally, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2855 high to $0.2710 low also acted as a resistance. At the moment, there is a short term breakout pattern forming with resistance near $0.2800 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If there is an upside break above $0.2800, ripple price could climb higher towards the key $0.2850 resistance area.\n\nAny further upsides might start another rise and the price could rally towards the $0.2950 and $0.3000 resistance levels. On the downside, the $0.2720 area is a strong support. If there is a break below $0.2720 and $0.2700, the price could extend its downside correction. The next key support is near the $0.2650 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\n\nLooking at the chart, ripple price is correcting gains from the $0.2850 resistance. It seems like it could test $0.2700 or even $0.2650 in the near term. Once the current correction is complete, the price could start a fresh rise towards $0.2800, $0.2850 and $0.2950.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for XRP/USD is slowly moving into the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for XRP/USD is currently just above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $0.2720, $0.2700 and $0.2650.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.2800, $0.2850 and $0.2920.", "description": "Ripple price is currently correcting gains against the US Dollar and bitcoin.
