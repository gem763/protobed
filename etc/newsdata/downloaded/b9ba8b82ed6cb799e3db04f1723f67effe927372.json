I was told over and over that they\u2019d not seen anything like this in 30 years. I knew it was a bad situation.\u2019\n\nEmma was taken away for an emergency three-hour procedure to repair the complicated tears before she was returned to a recovery ward.\n\nBut it was a matter of hours before she was back in the operating room, after doctors noticed that Emma had developed a pelvic hematoma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmma spent a week in hospital before she was well enough to go home, but even after she was discharged, the new mum was in constant pain.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s every mother\u2019s nightmare being separated from your baby. You want that bonding time.\u2019\n\nEmma and husband Mark with their healthy little girl Annabelle (Picture: Mercury Press & Media)\n\nDespite warnings from fellow mums that she would be sore, the teacher could tell something wasn\u2019t right, and spent hours on the internet searching for answers to why she was in such agony.\n\nShe was also unable to have sex with her husband, who had also been left traumatised by the birth.\n\nDesperate to end her pain, the couple went private and pushed for more tests, which revealed that Emma had an RVF and needed a setom \u2013 a piece of surgical thread to repair the abnormal connection.\n\nShe said: \u2018My day would start with excruciating pain when I went to the toilet. The pain was crippling, it would last a few hours, sometimes all day.\n\n\u2018Mark had to put a suit on and leave for work while I was crying out with pain.\u2019\n\nThe time she should\u2019ve spent bonding with her newborn was spent being bed-bound and reserving as much energy as she could to taking care of the baby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I felt completely in the dark, that my body had failed me, I was doomed and my active life was over.\n\n\u2018I was worried about my marriage. I was worried if I couldn\u2019t have sex if I couldn\u2019t have further children.\u2019\n\nSlowly over time, things began to improve, and Emma continued to look for support on the internet, eventually stumbling across the Mummy MOT \u2013 a postnatal check-up programme.\n\nNow, after discovering their specialist help, she is learning to manage her injuries.\n\nShe even went swimming for the first time and does private tutoring on weekends and evenings.\n\nIn September, the determined mum had her tenth surgery injecting steroids into her scar tissue to help with continual tightening and improving her pelvic floor.\n\nShe added: \u2018I am getting my life back. Mark and I always try to reflect over the last couple of months and look at what we\u2019ve achieved.\n\n\u2018We had our fifth wedding anniversary at the hotel we got married and I went swimming for the first time. I cried with happiness.\u2019\n\nMORE: Incredible photo shows how bones move during childbirth\n\nMORE: I was traumatised by childbirth.
