And that those ages 2 and up switch to 1-percent or non-fat (skim) to decrease their saturated fat intake.\n\nBut the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines say that if your baby is growing well and is consuming enough healthy fats, he can move straight to a reduced-fat milk at age 1; and that all kids aged 2 and up should drink skim milk. While the A.A.P.\u2019s general guidelines are not this strict, they agree that this approach can be appropriate for kids with a family history of \u2014 or other risk factors for \u2014 obesity or heart disease.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s much debate in the scientific community over whether lower-fat milks are really the best options for young children, said Dr. Maguire. Several observational studies published in the past decade, for example, have found that 2- to 4-year-olds who drank whole milk tended to be leaner \u2013 not heavier \u2013 than those who drank lower-fat milk. And in 2016, Dr. Maguire\u2019s research group published a study which found that 1- to 6-year-olds who drank whole milk not only had lower body mass indices than those who drank lower-fat milk, but also had higher vitamin D levels \u2014 perhaps because vitamin D is better-absorbed when it\u2019s consumed with fat.\n\nAs with many nutrition studies, it\u2019s not clear why this is or whether the whole milk itself directly led to these benefits. But until we have more conclusive data, this is a choice without a clear answer, said Dr. Maguire, so it\u2019s worth discussing with your pediatrician and considering the big picture of your child\u2019s growth and diet.", "description": "Whole or reduced-fat milk?
