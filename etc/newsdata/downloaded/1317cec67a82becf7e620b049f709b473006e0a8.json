Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotta stop. Period,\u201d Elway said on 850 KOA radio Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s no more excuses for it. He\u2019s had 26 holding penalties in the last two years and two games, so it\u2019s gotta stop.\u201d\n\nBolles had 10 holding penalties (three declined) as a rookie in 2017 and 11 (four declined) in 2018. He already has five through two games, including four (two declined) in Sunday\u2019s loss to the Bears, two of which came on the same drive. There was also a play in the fourth quarter where teammate Ronald Leary was called for a hold when it appeared Bolles could have been called.\n\nElway suggested he wasn\u2019t certain Bolles knows what is and isn\u2019t allowed by the rules with regard to holding.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gotta understand what he\u2019s doing and \u2014 that was my question yesterday: Does he know what holding is? Does he know what he can and can\u2019t do?\u201d Elway said. \u201cIf he thinks he\u2019s getting targeted, he\u2019s gotta realize he isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nElway took Bolles 20th overall in the 2017 draft, plugging him in as the starter at left tackle immediately. Through 34 career games, Bolles has allowed 11.5 sacks, per STATS LLC, and committed seven false starts, in addition to the holding penalties.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep working for it, and he\u2019s still a talented guy,\u201d Elway added. .\u201d.. Hopefully, with an explanation and a better understanding by him of what it is they are looking for ... he cannot do that because it\u2019s beating us.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos added highly regarded offensive line coach Mike Munchak this offseason with hopes of improving the line\u2019s development, Bolles included. The group has allowed five sacks and 10 quarterback hits through two games.\n\n\u201cYou have to learn from it, move forward and not let it be a detriment,\u201d Munchak told reporters Wednesday of Bolles\u2019 issues. \u201cWe can\u2019t let it be a drag on what he\u2019s trying to accomplish or what we\u2019re trying to accomplish, or what the line is trying to do. You don\u2019t want to hurt the team ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe talked to him extensively early in the week,\u201d head coach Vic Fangio added. \u201cMike (Munchak) did the bulk of it. ... He knows what he\u2019s up against and what he has to do.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Denver Broncos general manager John Elway was frank about the rash of holding penalties racked up by left tackle Garett Bolles.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431734612&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1WW-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
