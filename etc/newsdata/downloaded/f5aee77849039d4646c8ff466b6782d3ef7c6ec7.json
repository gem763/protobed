Prices are back to what appears to be an attractive area for investors, so let's see if the technical indicators have improved in recent months.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of URBN, below, we can see that prices are now above the bottoming 50-day moving average line.\n\nTrading volume was very heavy in August suggesting we may have seen a change in ownership from weak hands to stronger hands. The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a long decline, but some improvement from the middle of December that signals more aggressive buying after months of more aggressive selling.\n\nIn the lower panel in the 12-day price momentum study, which shows a higher low from May to August, while prices made lower lows. This is a bullish divergence and is a subtle clue that the decline is slowing.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of URBN, below, we can see that the $20 area is above the 2017 lows and a somewhat logical place for buyers or short covers to enter. URBN is still below the declining 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line shows some stability and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has crossed to the upside for a cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of URBN, below, we can see that the software is projecting a potential upside price target around $31.\n\nBottom line strategy: The long decline in URBN looks to be over, at least for now. We could see more sideways price action, but the stage looks to be set for a recovery back to the $31 area.
