This could be done anytime, regardless of where in the world one might be, he added.\n\nOn the performance of the judiciary, Mogoeng said its challenges had been exacerbated by an increased workload.\n\nHe said the 17th constitutional amendment had resulted in an increase in the workload of the apex court.\n\nMogoeng said an increase in direct applications had contributed to the inability to meet the targets, adding that of the 490 cases received by the court, 370 were finalised within the last financial year.\n\nThe chief justice also said the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein had \"performed well\".\n\nThe SCS managed to finalise 214 appeals of the 231 during the reporting period, he said.\n\nMogoeng also said the bulk of the work was done by the high court.\n\nOf the 145 127 civil cases the court received, 114 650 were finalised and of the 13 140 criminal matters, 10 666 were finalised, despite limited resources and a judicial establishment which has remained unchanged.\n\nMogoeng said the country's specialist courts had ensured that matters were \"expediently finalised\".\n\nThis saw the Labour and Labour Appeal Courts finalising 3 756 of 5 915 matters brought to them.", "description": "Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng says that someone offered him R600m for modernising courts, but that he rejected the offer \"because that is how capture happens\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7024/bf7111c5f08443d79b59d5534755b2df.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
