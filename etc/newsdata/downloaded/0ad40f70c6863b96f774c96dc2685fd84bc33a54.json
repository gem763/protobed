While those plants are good at neutralizing sewage microorganisms that can make people sick or pollute waterways, they can miss chemicals that are linked with our changing lifestyles.\n\nThe biggest change since most treatment plants were designed? The explosion of pharmaceutical use by Americans, Siegel told me during an interview in Axios' office.\n\nAbout 60% of American adults take at least one prescription pill every day, per the National Center for Health Statistics. Residue from those pills travels to treatment plants and waterways.\n\nWater testing often doesn't accurately reflect the risks of tap water, and testing processes can be manipulated to show passing results.\n\n\"There is evidence that we are being exposed to lots of pharmaceutical products at low levels \u2014 sub-therapeutic levels. ... We don't know who is drinking it or in what combinations or amounts.\"\n\n\u2014 Luke Iwanowicz, U.S. Geological Survey research biologist, in \"Troubled Water\"\n\nMeanwhile: City leaders are typically reluctant to raise water rates to pay for plant and pipe upgrades out of fear that residents will see it as an increased tax.\n\nAt the same time, though, bottled water sales are at record highs, and 90% of bottled-water consumers cite safety or quality for the reason. That suggests people are willing to pay more for clean water, Siegel writes.\n\nWhat's next: Siegel argues for consolidation of the number of water utilities \u2014 there are currently 51,535 drinking water utilities in the U.S., translating to 16 for every county. Los Angeles County alone has 200.\n\nSuch a large number of utilities impedes the adoption of new technologies, the replacement of failing pipes and the retention of trained engineers, he says.\n\nimpedes the adoption of new technologies, the replacement of failing pipes and the retention of trained engineers, he says. Utility management should be decoupled from municipal politics, he argues. With mayors valuing cost control over water quality control, they will continue to defer maintenance and needed infrastructure upgrades.\n\nshould be decoupled from municipal politics, he argues. With mayors valuing cost control over water quality control, they will continue to defer maintenance and needed infrastructure upgrades. Those upgrades will soon be unavoidable. There are 1.1 million miles of old water mains carry drinking water across the country, and at least 240,000 of them break every year.\n\nThe bottom line: The high levels of public trust local leaders enjoy will likely evaporate when residents become more aware of the health risks in their tap water, Siegel says.\n\nGo deeper: The lead pipe danger lurking underground", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
