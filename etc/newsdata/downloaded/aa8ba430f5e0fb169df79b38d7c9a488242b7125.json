In the \u201990s, he was accused of putting a stranglehold on the world\u2019s computers and his competition. Now, at age 63 and 19 years after stepping down as Microsoft\u2019s CEO, he\u2019s known for marshaling his massive wealth to try to solve intractable problems on a global level.\n\nA new documentary series attempts to reconcile the many facets of Mr. Gates. Directed by Davis Guggenheim, \u201cInside Bill\u2019s Brain: Decoding Bill Gates,\u201d is a three-part profile premiering on Netflix Sept. 20. Each episode connects chapters in his personal history to his current work with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with a focus on several philanthropy projects that have experienced challenges. The Gates foundation has made more than $50 billion in total grant payments since the founding of the first Gates family philanthropy, originally named for Mr. Gates\u2019s father, in 1994.\n\nHome movies capture the Seattle upbringing of a willful, fiercely intelligent boy in an episode that also follows Mr. Gates\u2019s quest to curb deadly sanitation issues with a new toilet design. His path from high-school computer lab to Microsoft\u2019s founding is juxtaposed in episode two with the foundation\u2019s effort to wipe out polio. The third episode explores Mr. Gates\u2019s bruising battle with the U.S. government during its antitrust suit against Microsoft, and also documents his work with experts trying to introduce a safer nuclear power plant.\n\nThe ascendant young titan in 1985.

Melinda Gates recalls finding her then-boyfriend writing factors for and against marriage on a whiteboard. \u201cHe\u2019s not just a giant brain. He does have big passions, but he\u2019s not steered by emotions,\u201d says series director Mr. Guggenheim, known for documentaries including \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d \u201cWaiting for \u2018Superman\u2019\u201d and \u201cHe Named Me Malala.\u201d\n\nMr. Gates spoke to the Journal about shifting public perceptions of him, what he envied about Steve Jobs, and how he absorbs knowledge. Here are edited excerpts.\n\nDid you enjoy the self reflection required for the documentary, or was it a means to an end for your and Melinda\u2019s work with the foundation?\n\nI got to talk to Warren [Buffett] about how he thinks about things and it was fun to hear Melinda talk about how she sees my mind as chaotic. Some family footage that I had never seen before got pulled out, and that was great. But polio eradication, climate change, sanitation, those are things I was enthused to talk about it. All the problems I take on require a lot of participation, whether it\u2019s scientists, or governments, or brilliant people in the field. They won\u2019t succeed unless you can talk to broad audiences and shift perceptions.\n\n\u2018Inside Bill\u2019s Brain\u2019 is partly devoted to humanizing America\u2019s original geek mogul. Photo: Netflix\n\nIt must be frustrating that these epic projects often hang on human factors that fly in the face of the rational way that you think.\n\nEradicating polio depends on stability in Afghanistan and the political priority we get in Pakistan. Nigeria required a lot of super intense work, particularly in the northeast where Boko Haram showed up. Any time you do a disease eradication you\u2019ll end up in the most unstable and difficult places in the world. We didn\u2019t really expect that. But you adjust and focus in. That\u2019s why you need to build these teams with gigantic, diverse skillsets. I\u2019m good at thinking how the pieces fit together conceptually but then there\u2019s massive amounts of work and communication required.\n\nYou were hailed as a tech wunderkind and then experienced a backlash against Microsoft. Is that similar to what\u2019s happening for today\u2019s tech titans like Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg ?\n\nAs soon as tech became important, with the personal computer and the internet, there was certainly a duality where people were saying, \u201cOh my God, this is brilliant stuff,\u201d but they were also looking at me, or other leaders in the industry, and saying, \u201cWhat motivates their work? Do they understand the potential negative side effects?\u201d I\u2019m sort of the poster boy of that original duality. By some measures I was extremely popular and by some measures I was extremely\u2014you know, people worried what Microsoft was up to. What\u2019s happening now is more of a mainstream thing. The concerns are legitimate, and they\u2019re touching more areas of life now.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What would you ask Bill Gates about his life, if you could? Join the conversation below.\n\nWas it painful to revisit the footage from your deposition during the antitrust trial against Microsoft?\n\nIt\u2019s all online. My son watched every minute and said, \u201cHey Dad, don\u2019t you think you could have done a better job?\u201d Yeah, I guess I could have. Look, there were some elements of that whole thing that I consider unfair, but if you take the scope of my life, I\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s in a position to complain about anything. Those aren\u2019t my favorite moments and I can still explain to you why the government was completely wrong, but that\u2019s really old news at this point. For me personally, it did accelerate my move into that next phase, two to five years sooner, of shifting my focus over to the foundation. So explaining to people why that [the lawsuit] wasn\u2019t fair to me? I better skip that part.\n\nAt the time, were you able to laugh along with things like the \u201cSimpsons\u201d episode where Bill Gates smashes Homer\u2019s internet startup?\n\nThere was some funny stuff. The fact that people in their 20s get huge chunks of money and are making big decisions with tens of thousands of employees, there will always be questions about whether they understand broad societal concerns, or are a little bit arrogant. So the fact that people would have mixed views of me, that came with the territory. That the legal thing went the way it did, I\u2019m still disappointed a bit in that.\n\nDid anyone at Microsoft ever attempt a Bill Gates makeover?\n\nNobody ever tried to get rid of my freckles or stop me from rocking or chewing my glasses. If you watch this documentary, I\u2019m clearly not cured of that. It\u2019s the main thing I do in my life. I read and I chew glasses. That\u2019s my job.\n\nIn the documentary you say, \u201cIt\u2019s not my goal to be inspiring.\u201d Is that a problem in our society, that it\u2019s not enough to have a smart idea, you have to inspire people with it too?\n\nSome things, like eradicating polio, are inherently inspiring. People want some moral center, to be involved in something bigger than the size of their paycheck. I\u2019m lucky to work in a lot of things like climate change or improving urban slums that can draw in a level of talent that the economics wouldn\u2019t command, but a sense of purpose can. But I myself am not a preacher. I\u2019ve learned a little bit about public speaking, and how to articulate how to solve these problems over time. I\u2019ve gotten OK on that in a certain sense. Steve Jobs was always more of a natural at that. He could talk about what, in the case of NeXT Computer [his follow-up after being ousted from Apple], was not that good of a machine, yet mesmerize people to death if they happened to be in the auditorium. I wish I could be as magical because I have causes that are in some ways more impactful and I need to make sure they don\u2019t get ignored. And particularly as countries are turning inward, we have a huge challenge to maintain a commitment to these global issues.\n\nYou\u2019ve recently been in the news for another reason: You\u2019re one of many high-profile wealthy people alleged to have had an association with Jeffrey Epstein. One report said you met with him after he pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in 2008. Can you describe your relationship with him?\n\nI met him. I didn\u2019t have any business relationship or friendship with him. I didn\u2019t go to New Mexico or Florida or Palm Beach or any of that. There were people around him who were saying, hey, if you want to raise money for global health and get more philanthropy, he knows a lot of rich people. Every meeting where I was with him were meetings with men. I was never at any parties or anything like that. He never donated any money to anything that I know about.\n\n[A New Yorker article published after this interview took place reported that Epstein directed a $2 million donation by Mr. Gates to MIT\u2019s Media Lab. A representative for Mr. Gates said in a statement, \u201cAlthough Epstein pursued Bill Gates aggressively, any account of a business partnership or personal relationship between the two is simply not true. And any claim that Epstein directed any programmatic or personal grantmaking for Bill Gates is completely false.\u201d]\n\nIn the series Melinda describes the inner working of your mind as \u201cchaos.\u201d How would you describe it?\n\nI think it\u2019s the opposite of chaos. I\u2019ll just take one dimension: timeline. If you name a point in time, or something that happened in history with, say, chemistry or relativity, I can attach knowledge to previous knowledge. So when I read a new book, there are already patterns, and it\u2019s just a lot simpler for me to build on that basis. It\u2019s not just an endless set of things that I have no framework for.\n\nThe Bill Gates Bookshelf\n\nBill Gates\u2019s constant companion is a tote bag full of books. He digests about one book per week, typically on topics that overlap with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s agenda. He says recent standout titles include \u201cPrepared\u201d by educator Diane Tavenner, about helping kids find a path to a fulfilled life; \u201cLoonshots,\u201d Safi Bahcall \u2019s book about nurturing creative ideas that may initially seem nuts; and \u201cThese Truths,\u201d a re-examination of U.S. history by Jill Lepore.\n\nHe has less time for fiction, yet he has made a long-term commitment to the work of David Foster Wallace. Mr. Gates says he is reading \u201cevery word\u201d the late author wrote before tackling his epic novel \u201cInfinite Jest.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t start books without finishing them, so starting a 1,600 page book with massive footnotes is daunting even for an ambitious reader,\u201d Mr. Gates says. \u201cThere are books like that that go around the world several times before I open them up.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to television, Mr. Gates reports a common problem: the difficulty he and his wife have keeping up with the flow of new releases and recommendations from friends. Dramas and thrillers are well-represented among shows in their rotation, including \u201cBroadchurch\u201d (investigators probe a child\u2019s murder); \u201cA Million Little Things\u201d (friends cope with a peer\u2019s suicide), \u201cMoney Heist\u201d (robbers attack the Royal Mint of Spain); and biographical series about Queen Elizabeth II (\u201cThe Crown\u201d) and Roger Ailes (\u201cThe Loudest Voice\u201d).\n\nWrite to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.com", "description": "A new documentary profiles the tech-titan-turned-philanthropist.
