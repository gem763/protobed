Well that\u2019s interesting.\n\nParticularly since the Democrats have been busily working to impeach President Donald Trump over supposed nefarious Ukraine wheelings and dealings.\n\nParticularly since a couple of Republican senators, as The Washington Times previously reported, have requested the Justice Department to investigate whether or not Ukrainian officials tried to undermine Trump\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 and asked for Attorney General William Barr to give them the answer by Oct. 14.\n\nAccording to Politico \u2014 according to a Politico report from Jan. 11, 2017, that was linked on the USUBC\u2019s page \u2014 the answer to that question is a clear-cut \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nFlashback, Politico.\n\nHeadine: \u201cUkrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s how that 2017 story starts: \u201cKiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the president-elect [Trump] after quietly working to boost Clinton.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a worthwhile read.\n\nOne excerpt: \u201cUkrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office.\u201d\n\nAnother: \u201cA Ukrainian-American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee met with top officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia.\u201d\n\nAs news watchers recall, Manafort did ultimately resign and face charges. The Trump campaign did face ongoing \u2014 unfounded \u2014 accusations of collusion with Russia.\n\nThe piece goes on to report how Ukraine\u2019s \u201cinvolvement in the [2016 presidential] race\u201d to the White House \u201cappears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another\u2019s elections.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was this tidbit: \u201cThe Ukrainian antipathy for Trump\u2019s team \u2014 and alignment with [Hillary] Clinton\u2019s \u2014 can be traced back to late 2013. That\u2019s when the country\u2019s president, Viktor Yanukovych [removed from power in 2014], whom Manafort had been advising, abruptly backed out of a European Union pact linked to anti-corruption reforms,\u201d and instead, signed a bailout agreement with Russia, where he then fled.\n\nShortly after, a woman named Alexandra Chalupa caught wind of the Manafort-Yanukovych connection. Who\u2019s Chalupa?\n\nThe daughter of Ukrainian immigrants. A lawyer by training. And a Democratic operative who had worked during the Clinton administration in the White House Office of Public Liaison, and who then went on to a position with the Democratic National Committee as a consultant.\n\n\u201cThe DNC paid her $412,000 from 2004 to June 2016,\u201d Politico wrote, citing Federal Election Commission records.\n\nAnd Chalupa used her position, contacts and experience to align with investigative journalists, intelligence officials and government and citizen sources in both Kiev and Washington, D.C., to dig deeper into Manafort and, possibly, Trump improprieties.\n\n\u201cShe occasionally shared her findings with officials from the DNC and Clinton\u2019s campaign,\u201d Politico wrote. \u201cShe said she shared her concern [about a Manafort-Russia connection] with Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Valeriy Chaly, and one of his top aides, Oksana Shulyar.\u201d\n\nAt the time, nobody thought Trump was much of a contender for the White House, so the findings were largely yawned. Until Trump hired Manafort, that is.\n\nAll of a sudden, the DNC was all ears.\n\n\u201c[W]ith the DNC\u2019s encouragement, Chalupa asked [Ukrainian] embassy staff to try to arrange an interview in which Proshenko [Ukraine president, 2014-2019] might discuss Manafort\u2019s ties to Yanukovych,\u201d Politico wrote. Apparently, embassy folk said no, but they then offered Chalupa quiet assistance \u2014 quiet, so that they couldn\u2019t be seen as too political.\n\nShulyar, aide to Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the United States, denied any such assistance came from the embassy \u2014 or from her. Then again, of course she would; \u2018twouldn\u2019t look good for Ukraine to appear to pick a campaign side, right?\n\nHold that thought.\n\n\u201cBut Andrii Telizhenko, who worked as a political officer in the Ukrainian Embassy under Shulyar, said [Shulyar] instructed him to help Chalupa research connections between Trump, Manafort and Russia,\u201d Politico reported.\n\nTelizhenoko\u2019s quoted remarks?\n\n\u201cOksana [Shulyar] said that if I had any information, or knew other people who did, then I should contact Chalupa. \u2026 They were coordinating an investigation with the Hillary team on Paul Manafort with Alexandra Chalupa. \u2026 Oksana was keeping it all quiet [but] the embassy worked very closely with [Chalupa],\u201d Telizhenko told Politico.\n\nOther sources confirmed.\n\nAnd the goal, Politico wrote, was to get a congressional hearing \u2014 or, even better, a congressional investigation.\n\n\u201cChalupa confirmed that a week after Manafort\u2019s hiring was announced, she discussed the possibility of a congressional investigation with a foreign policy legislative assistant in the office of Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH),\u201d Politico reported.\n\nThe story goes on.\n\nThe rabbit hole goes deeper.\n\nBut one big takeaway is this: When it comes to Democrats pointing fingers at Team Trump for crooked Ukraine dealings, fact is, they better look inward. They better look at Clinton. They better look at their own DNC.\n\nAnother takeaway?\n\nThe two Republican senators, Ron Johnson and Charles Grassley, requesting Justice Department information about Ukraine\u2019s interference in the 2016 election better kick it into high gear.\n\nLike much the Democrats accuse, the trail of corruption doesn\u2019t so much stop at Trump\u2019s door as it meanders on down Clinton Lane, right alongside DNC Way.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
