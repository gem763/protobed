That\u2019s nearly the $300 billion per year over the current system that is estimated to cover Medicare for All (though estimates vary). While we can\u2019t un-spend that $4.9 trillion, imagine if we could make different choices for the next 20 years. We\u2019ve identified more than $300 billion in annual military savings alone that we could better invest in priorities like Medicare for All, working with a national grassroots movement called Poor People\u2019s Campaign.\n\n\u201cWe can afford Medicare for All,\u201d Omar wrote. \u201cWhat we cannot afford is losing more lives to endless wars and a health insurance industry that profits off sickness\u201d:\n\nWe can afford Medicare for All. What we cannot afford is losing more lives to endless wars and a health insurance industry that profits off sickness. https://t.co/STeTKxFFt0 \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 22, 2019\n\nWhile estimates tend to vary, one from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University assessed that the government-run healthcare system would cost $32 trillion over the next decade alone and would require massive tax increases. It would ultimately result in a \u201ctransformative change in the size of the federal government,\u201d according to the study\u2019s author Charles Blahous.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nBlahous argues that the estimates for the $32 trillion price tag are relatively conservative because they assume that Sanders\u2019 bill achieves its goals of reducing payments to health providers, as well as lowering drug prices and administrative costs. The Mercatus Center suggested that doubling federal individual and corporate income tax would not cover the costs of the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan.\n\nHowever, Blahous later testified before the House Rules Committee\u2019s hearing on Medicare for All and said the federal government\u2019s total spending on a government-run healthcare system could top $60 trillion over the next decade.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nBlahous said that the $32 trillion price tag was too conservative and that given historical spending levels on health care, net new federal spending would likely increase spending by $38.8 trillion over the next ten years and would increase federal healthcare spending to 13 to 15 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The Mercatus scholar also noted that the Medicare for All\u2019s total federal spending price over the next ten years would amount to between $54.6 trillion and $60.7 trillion. Blahous mentioned that \u201cdoubling individual and corporate income taxes would be insufficient to finance even the lower bound\u201d of the $32.6 trillion in new federal spending.\n\nMost Americans, 64 percent, are opposed to paying more in taxes to implement Medicare for All, according to a Locust Street Group released in August.\n\nOmar\u2019s position follows her endorsement of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who remains a fierce proponent of a single-payer system. Sanders has been extremely forthcoming on how he would pay for the implementation of the multi-trillion dollar proposal, openly admitting that taxes will go up for middle class Americans but arguing that overall \u201ccost\u201d will go down as premiums are erased. The latter is an argument Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has made repeatedly, but she has yet to explicitly say if she would raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for Medicare for All.\n\n\u201cWhat our bill does \u2026 what people should understand is that what Medicare for All does is eliminates your private health insurance premiums. You\u2019re not going to be paying that, you\u2019re not going to be paying co-payments, you\u2019re not going to be paying deductibles,\u2019 Sanders told Iowa CBS affiliate KCCI in May.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be seeing your prescription drug cost, in my view, come down by 50 percent. Will you be paying more in taxes? Yes, you will,\u201d he added.\n\nCost, however, is not the only concern. Opponents of Medicare for All also point to bureaucratic mismanagement and argue that a government-run healthcare system will result in a sharp decline in overall quality of care.", "description": "Far-left \"Squad\" member Rep.
