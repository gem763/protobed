Instant Effects AM Energiser costs \u00a329.99 Harley Street aesthetic and anti-aging specialist Dr Ioannis Liakas of Vie Aesthetics says: 'Damaged, aged skin looks dull, is lacking hydration and loses moisture due to defective cellular production of reduced energy. 'This product's patented OX2 technology overcomes this by a continuous flow of oxygen into the skin cells. The result is better cellular function, increased defence ability of skin cells, better hydration status as well as preservation of moisture within the skin cells. 'It is effectively de-ageing the skin from the inside, working with your skin to boost its defence against day to day exposure to pollution and oxidation.' He claims daily use would result in skin becoming immune to oxidative damage and ultimately reverse time.\n\n'The development of this product is an exciting game-changer for skincare regimes.'\n\nThe cream contains almost 30 per cent of 'active ingredients', while the average in most other face lotions is as low as two per cent.\n\nAs well as Japanese seaweed, it contains patented yeast extract, is high in antioxidants and has a patented OX2 Technology.\n\nInstant Effects claims it tricks the skin's metabolism into acting as it did 10 years ago, leaving skin cells to produce brighter skin, an increase in collagen production and ultimately a younger-looking complexion.\n\nIn today's time-challenged world, the \u00a329.99 cream has the added benefit of slashing the time it takes to get ready - doing the job of a serum, primer and day cream all rolled into one.\n\nBeauty bloggers who've got their hands on the product are raving about the results.\n\nJames Jackets (@all.things.skin) wrote: 'Great for anyone wanting an instant brightening look to the skin. This gave a really natural healthy glow. It also has an SPF15 in and many natural hydrating qualities.

I did find that my skin was soft, felt moisturised and glowing too. When you prep skin appropriately, make-up will glide on the skin.'\n\nPolly Ahmad (@thisgirllikes2shop) wrote: 'If you wake up feeling dehydrated or your skin is feeling really dull then this moisturiser will glide on giving your skin an almost instant morning perk.\n\n'I've found when I apply this I use less make-up because my skin feels and looks more radiant throughout the day.'", "description": "The AM Energiser Day Cream from British beauty brand Instant Effects costs \u00a330.
