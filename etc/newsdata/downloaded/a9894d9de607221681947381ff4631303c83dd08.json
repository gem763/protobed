All I knew is from my waist up I wasn\u2019t dry but I wasn\u2019t wet either like my legs were.\n\n\"I could feel this incredible pressure crushing down on my lower back.\"\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nDuring the life-or-death struggle he had an eerie feeling of relief that he wasn't trapped in the jaws of a crocodile.\n\nThe former British Army serviceman miraculously escaped the rogue hippo's jaws and survived despite suffering gruesome injuries that resulted in his left arm being amputated.\n\nHis colleague, Evans Namasango, drowned after he was knocked out of a canoe during the horrifying incident in his native Zimbabwe in March 1996.\n\nMr Templer, then 27, and fellow guides were taking six tourists on a canoe trip near Victoria Falls when they came across a group of hippos in the crocodile-infested river in Africa.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nThe hippo that attacked had been aggressive towards visitors in the past, knocking Mr Templer out of his canoe on a previous journey.\n\nThe former guide, who has written a book called What\u2019s Left of Me, said the group kept a safe distance from the school of hippos which included the aggressive male weighing about 8,000lbs, almost twice the weight of a Land Rover.\n\nBut things went horribly wrong when they tried to go around the animals.\n\nMr Templer, who owned the safari company, said: \"There was this loud thud behind me and I knew that thud. It was the sound of a hippo hitting a canoe.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"I turned to see the back of the canoe maybe three feet out of the water atop a hippo and the apprentice guide (Mr Namasango) flying out of it.\"\n\nHe turned around and paddled towards Mr Namasango in a desperate attempt to save him.\n\nHe added: \"Evans is bobbing along in the water and then I see this big wave, kind of like a torpedo coming towards a ship, at quite a pace.\n\n\"I pull up alongside him, lean over to grab him and it\u2019s almost a little too made-for-Hollywood moment with our fingers almost touching.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n\"Suddenly everything just went dark and quiet. I struggled to break free.\n\n\"I was sitting in (the hippo's mouth) with my arms pressed to my sides. I could feel the bristles on a hippo\u2019s snout.\n\n\"My first response was just complete relief because I feared I was inside a croc, and in a weird way there\u2019s some solace being in a hippo.\n\n\"That lasted an odd second and then I thought 'I\u2019ve got to get out of here', but I couldn\u2019t do anything because I\u2019m tightly wedged in his mouth.\"\n\nMr Templer, who weighed about 200lbs at the time, was in a fight for his life and the odds weren't in his favour - the hippo is the world's deadliest large land mammal, killing about 500 people a year in Africa.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nThe former guide, now a management consultant and public speaker living in Chicago in the US, said: \"The hippo half spit, half choked me out and I burst to the surface, grab a lung full of fresh air and I\u2019m face to face with Evans.\n\n\"I started swimming away but Evans was struggling to stay afloat. When I looked at him I could see he was absolutely terrified and in the grips of panic.\n\n\"I swam back to him, then suddenly, wham, I was in the hippo\u2019s throat again, but this time my legs were down his throat and he started thrashing me around again.\"\n\nMr Templer tried to grab his holstered gun, a .357 Magnum revolver, but the hippo was thrashing him around so violently that he couldn't get his hands on the weapon.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nWhen the hippo spat him out a second time, he came up for air and tried to swim away, but he was attacked again.\n\nHe said: \"I was looking under my arm and I saw hippo with its mouth wide open.\n\n\"His tusks tore into my torso and now my legs are hanging out of one side of his mouth and my arms and my head and my shoulder are outside the other.\n\n\"This time he truly went berserk.\n\n\"He threw me up in the air and I did a half twist before I fell back into his mouth and he bit down so hard I thought he was going to bite me in half.\"\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nHippos - the world's deadliest mammal The hippopotamus is the world's deadliest large land mammal, killing about 500 people a year in Africa. Adult hippos can weigh up to 8,000lbs and grow larger than a car, with a length of up to 15ft and a shoulder height of almost 6ft. Known for their aggressive and territorial nature, hippos can easily crush a human to death and they have powerful jaws and razor sharp, 20in teeth that can rip off limbs and tear through flesh. The hippopotamus is a herbivore and its average life span in the wild is 40 years. Dubbed \"river horses\" by the Greeks, hippos spend most of their time in rivers and lakes, and they can hold their breath for several minutes while swimming or diving to depths of several feet. When they aren't in the water they are usually grazing, basking in the sun or sleeping.\n\nThe hippo dived up to eight feet with Mr Templer trapped in its jaws as he bled profusely.\n\nHe said: \"I was relatively calm and I remember wondering who could hold their breath the longest.\n\n\"I was watching my blood coming out and I was wondering if I was going to bleed to death or if I would drown.\"\n\nBut the hippo then surged to the surface and spit him out again. He was rescued by a fellow guide and kayaker, named Mack, who dragged him to rocks and tried to stem the flow of blood as Mr Templer went into shock.\n\nAs he lay bleeding he asked about Mr Namasango but was told: \"He's gone, mate.\"\n\nMr Templer, who suffered almost 40 severe bite wounds, said: \"I was a mess. My one arm from the elbow up had been crushed to a pulp and from the elbow down most of the skin had been pulled off it.\n\n(Image: De Agostini via Getty Images)\n\n\"My other arm was kind of hanging on. My foot looked like someone had to beat a hole through it with a hammer.\n\n\"Blood started bubbling out of my mouth because I had internal injuries.\n\n\"You could see part of a lung through a hole in my back. I had a bite in the back of my head.\n\n\"One of the bites had severed an artery but the hippo bit it at the right angle that he tore it but it sealed itself.\n\n\"By the time I got rescued I lost so much blood that my status was inconsistent with life. I shouldn\u2019t have been alive.\"\n\nTerrified and in incredible pain, Mr Templer was loaded into a canoe and the group set off to look for help.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nTheir first aid kit and radios were at the bottom of the river, the sun was setting and the crazed hippo was bumping up against the canoe.\n\nMr Templer thought he was going to die, telling the group: \"Please tell my family I am sorry and I love them.\"\n\nHe had a near-death experience, describing it as \"a profoundly spiritual experience where my entire being was infused with this incredible sense of peace, like a moment of choice - should I stay or should I go?\n\n\"It was the moment I made the choice (to live) and all the pain came flooding back in and it was so intense that I wished I would die, but I didn't.\"\n\nHe was saved by sheer luck - the group encountered a rescue team which happened to be practising nearby.\n\nWithout any painkillers, it took eight hours for him to get to a hospital for the first of multiple surgeries to keep him alive.\n\nHis left arm had to be amputated but surgeons managed to save his other arm and his badly-injured leg.\n\n(Image: Buena Vista Images)\n\nMr Namasango's body was recovered from the river a few days later.\n\nMr Templer wasn't supposed to be on the trip - he stepped in as a last-minute replacement for a guide who had come down with malaria.\n\nHe said: \"In the wild, we\u2019re the visitors, we\u2019re the intruders. The hippo attacked because I was invading its territory.\"\n\nHe faced a lengthy physical recovery in the following months and years, and the deadly attack continues to haunt him.\n\nHe said: \"I was angry, I felt guilty, I felt responsible for Evans as the person in charge.\"\n\nTwo years after the attack, he paddled the length of the 1,600-mile Zambezi with one arm, a month-long journey that proved to be \"cathartic\" for him.\n\nHe is convinced he encountered the same hippo again when one popped out of the water next to his canoe.\n\nIt dived back under as he screamed at the top of his lungs.\n\nMore than 20 years on from the attack, he said: \"If I could undo the day and Evans could still be here and I could have two arms I would in a heartbeat.\n\n\"I have a pretty strong faith and I just figure maybe there was something to be done with what happened.\"\n\nHe has since launched the Templer Foundation which helps people affected by post traumatic stress disorder and terminally ill and disabled children and their families.\n\nOne of the programmes, Erin's Light, is named after his 14-year-old daughter, who is profoundly cognitively impaired.\n\nHe said: \"We all have s***ty days and I have learned that stuff is going to happen but we get to choose what\u2019s going to happen next.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Safari guide Paul Templer lost an arm and had almost 40 bite wounds after he was swallowed and violently thrashed around by a rogue hippo in the Zambezi River in Zimbabwe", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Facebook", "Afp Getty Images", "Reuters", "De Agostini Via Getty Images", "Buena Vista Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536041.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FP-I-was-swallowed-by-a-hippo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
