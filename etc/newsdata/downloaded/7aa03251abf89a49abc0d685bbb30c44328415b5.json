Me and Cain, we\u2019ve got a rivalry going back from when he was UFC heavyweight champion, from a right few years ago,\u201d Fury said. \u201cThere was a lot of back and forward on social media back then. And, who knows, maybe that rivalry could spill over into WWE.\u201d\n\nFury is technically still the lineal heavyweight champion of the world, having never been beaten inside the ring. And while he is determined to complete his return to boxing\u2019s heavyweight summit, he\u2019s clearly relishing a slight break from the norm as he rubs shoulders with heavyweights from different genres of sport and sports entertainment.\n\nAnd while a match with Velasquez would certainly carry some crossover interest, Fury said he\u2019d welcome the opportunity to challenge any of the world\u2019s top big men.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to fight them all,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a prizefighter. I\u2019ve never ducked a fight in my life, and I\u2019ll fight anybody.\u201d", "description": "Tyson Fury and Cain Velasquez have history together as former heavyweight champions, and \"maybe that rivalry could spill over into WWE.\"", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Brian Garcia", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/off-guard-tyson-fury.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
