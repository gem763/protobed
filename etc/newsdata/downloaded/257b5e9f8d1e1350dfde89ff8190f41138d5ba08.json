The black and white feature tells the story of a Cornish fishing village and the tensions between residents and incomers, younger and older generations, that simmer within it. It\u2019s both poignant and relevant. It also, however, has something to say about the film industry.\n\nDirector Mark Jenkin used clockwork cameras and 16mm film to shoot it. The sound effects and the actors\u2019 voices were added afterwards, giving it the look of a foreign language film dubbed into English.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s this very uniqueness, in an era of CGI-heavy blockbusters, that put off the major chains. They were all invited to attend screenings by the British Film Institute, which is serving as the film\u2019s distributor. They just didn\u2019t bite.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe BFI is nonetheless delighted with its performance and the buzz it has generated. Bait has managed to sell out cinemas where it has been shown, driven by word of mouth and social media. The backing of high-profile critics such as Mark Kermode hasn\u2019t hurt.\n\nBut even though it has become something of a sleeper success, it managed just 47 screens by its third week, having expanded from 24 in its opening week. Excluding pop-ups, Britain\u2019s 775 cinemas boast a total of 4,340. So that\u2019s a little over 1 per cent.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nOf course, a film like this is never going to have the appeal of a big-budget spectacular. It\u2019s a small and intimate tale, although towards the end the tension is cranked up to thriller-like levels.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t a difficult one. Notwithstanding its unusual look and feel, this isn\u2019t one of those art-house movies people think they have to sing the praises of while privately wondering what they were watching and wishing they\u2019d been to see the Avengers instead.\n\nMultiplexes are there to make money, so of course they will show what they think people want to watch. But Bait\u2019s results on the screens it has graced, and the (justified) acclaim it has garnered from those lucky enough to see it, suggest those responsible for what gets into cinemas may be guilty of missing a trick.\n\nThis brings us to the heated debate that took place over another small, intimate, black and white film, this one with subtitles to boot. Roma was also seen on only a limited number of screens. It nonetheless got a very wide audience thanks to its ownership by Netflix.\n\nThe streaming giant\u2019s dollars, an A-list director in the form of Alfonso Cuaron, and the same sort of rapturous critical reception Bait has achieved helped the film to 10 Oscar nominations and three wins. It was criminally cheated of the Best Film gong by Green Book.\n\nPart of the reason might have been the controversy it generated within the industry. Netflix refused cinema chains their cherished 90-day window of exclusivity, so it was shunned with just a small number of exceptions.\n\nThis irked a number of powerful film industry figures, including no less than Steven Spielberg, who said he felt it should have been classified as a \u201cmade for TV movie\u201d and made ineligible for the awards.\n\nThe flip side is that Netflix did at least ensure Roma got seen by those without easy access to an art house or independent theatre willing to give it a run.\n\nIt\u2019s true that competition for cinema space is fierce. There were 503 releases in 2008 but 787 in 2018. It\u2019s also true that Britain\u2019s big chains will sometimes take a shot on smaller films when there\u2019s a gap between Disney/Marvel releases or big-name movies from the box office kingpin\u2019s rivals.\n\nMy local showcase, for example, screened Dirty God, another small film produced in Britain, which tells the story of the survivor of an acid attack.\n\nBut there\u2019s been no Bait to hook its customers. At least not yet. And that\u2019s a shame.\n\nIts absence from multiplexes serves to strengthen the hand of those who argue that Netflix is democratising cinema by helping to get films seen that might otherwise get lost.\n\nIn the meantime, the BFI is planning to offer up Bait via its own streaming service. For now, its website offers a list of cinemas where the film is showing.\n\nIf you like interesting and original movies, hell, if you just like movies, it would be worth your perusing it. The more money this film makes, the wider the audience it will get. And an audience is what it deserves.", "description": "Bait is a Cornish film that has hooked critics and cinemagoers wherever it has been shown.\u00a0The black and white feature tells the story of a Cornish fishing village and the tensions between residents and incomers, younger and older generations, that simmer within it.
