I would die for this one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Thank you for forever being by my side. You have taught me so much, walked through all of this with me, STAYED and you remind me to be a better, human being. I\u2019m on your side for life [sic].\u2019\n\nIt comes after Taylor heaped nothing but praise and sweet words on Selena while discussing the popstar\u2019s epic comeback with new single Lose You To Love Me in an interview with Apple Music Beats 1\u2019s Zane Lowe.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the best thing she\u2019s ever done [her new music]\u2026 I\u2019m so proud of her. She\u2019s been through so much,\u2019 Taylor said on the show.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve watched so much happen in her life and had a front row seat to so much, and I\u2019m so proud of her. She is such a revelation because now she\u2019s making her best stuff. I am 100 percent convinced this is the best thing she\u2019s done so far.\u2019\n\nKim K appears to have sent Selena her SKIMS shapewear to promote (Picture: Kim Kardashian, Instagram)\n\nTaylor continued: \u2018The things that she\u2019s overcome, the situations that she\u2019s risen above. It\u2019s been a long time that we\u2019ve been friends, and she\u2019s the best. She\u2019s just the best. I\u2019m really excited because when somebody has had great life experience, has had really tough things they\u2019ve had to go through, and they can process that and make art that\u2019s going to help other people, that\u2019s what kind of song this is. I\u2019m stoked.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her own interview with Zane, Selena was played an audio clip of Taylor\u2019s kind sentiments and became emotional.\n\nShe explained: \u2018[Taylor has been an] amazing [friend]. For sure. She was frustrated when I was frustrated. She was sad when I was sad.\n\n\u2018But more than anything, my friends stood by my side. I think they visibly saw me in so much pain and they didn\u2019t want it for me, but they never stopped loving me.\n\n\u2018And I played her the song, and I played it with her mum and dad and I showed her the video and her mum and Taylor started crying.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
