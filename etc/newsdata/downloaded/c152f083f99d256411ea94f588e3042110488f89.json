After a TMO review, Berry showed Ireland-born flanker Quill a straight red card, and he is set to miss the rest of the USA\u2019s World Cup as a result.\n\nBut Berry and TMO Ben Skeen did not pick up on England centre Francis, who hit USA full-back Will Hooley high with the very first tackle of the match. Francis will now face disciplinary action after being cited on Friday, with Australia\u2019s Reece Hodge and Samoa\u2019s Rey Lee-Lo both receiving three-week bans for similar tackles, but Jones went on the offensive in his refusal to discuss anything to do with the incidents in question, or World Rugby\u2019s mid-week condemnation of refereeing performances at the World Cup.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

I have got nothing else to say. So work it out. If you haven\u2019t got anything else I am out of here.\n\n\u201cI am not talking about those tackles guys. I am going to leave that to the judiciary. That is the process. If you don\u2019t understand that I am sorry. I can\u2019t say any more. You create your own headlines. I am a rugby coach.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

People make mistakes. People always make mistakes. We play a tough physical game and we go out hitting people as hard as we can. We want to do it legally but players make mistakes.\u201d\n\nThe decision not to discuss the tackles come on the same day as the full details into Australian Reece Hodge\u2019s ban were made public, in which the wing claimed he was unaware of World Rugby\u2019s new Decision-making for high tackles framework, raising serious questions of Michael Cheika and his backroom team.\n\nBut George Kruis, the England lock, revealed that England rarely discuss avoiding high tackles as they know themselves what is fair and foul. \u201cWe don\u2019t get a say in how it\u2019s run, and the referees don\u2019t get a say in how it\u2019s run. For us it\u2019s one not to talk about, but action. They are the rules and we have to stick to them, and learn to play by.\u201d\n\nFrancis\u2019s tackle may not be the only one that catches the eye of the citing commissioner after replacement flanker Mark Wilson was involved in an awkward-looking tackle on Hooley, resulting in the Cambridge-born full-back being carried off the field and taken to hospital with what USA boss Gary Gold described as \u201ca very bad concussion\u201d.\n\nWith his side taking 10 points from 10, Jones was pleased to see his side came through a second match unscathed, meaning who could have 31 fit and available players for next weekend\u2019s third pool match against Argentina, pending any disciplinary issues. Both Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell will be put through their paces on Friday morning to see how they have recovered from hamstring and ankle injuries respectively before joining the rest of the team and staff in taking two days off before resuming their World Cup campaign on Sunday, when Jones says they will enter \u201cstage two\u201d of the campaign to lift the Webb Ellis Cup.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re free, free to jump off boats in harbours, throw things around, anything,\u201d said Jones in a playful nod to the 2011 World Cup debacle. \u201cIf they want to go somewhere else they can. We\u2019re giving them a break. A few of the players have got families here so they can spend time with their families.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s stage one of the tournament done. We move into stage two now which is Argentina, then we\u2019ve got stage three, four and five. It\u2019s like the Tour de France.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be in the yellow jersey now. It\u2019s like Lance Armstrong, the percentage of time you need to be in the yellow jersey is the time that it counts, not when it doesn\u2019t count. It doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s in it now. It\u2019s inconsequential.\u201d\n\nDowload or listen to the latest episode of The Indy Rugby Podcast.", "description": "Eddie Jones\u00a0refused to discuss either the tackle on Owen Farrell that saw John Quill red carded for the United States or the one by Piers Francis that could result in England\u00a0receiving their first ban of the 2019 Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/18/Eddie-Jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
