The boat had been chartered by Worldwide Diving Adventures.\n\nAmong those killed in the fire was Worldwide Diving Adventures co-owner Kristina Finstad, 41.\n\nThis story will be updated.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ventura County Star: California boat fire: crewman sues Conception owner over tragedy", "description": "Ryan Sims filed the suit last week in Ventura County Superior Court saying the Conception dive boat was unseaworthy and operated in an unsafe manner.", "authors": ["Ventura County Star"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YvJu0PjMuamqEOlG.bt3sg--~B/aD0yNzAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/c22d5eed128e1196fa7d8f7e80fc6d72", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
