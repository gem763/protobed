It's beautiful.\"\n\nNASA plans to wrap up the five battery spacewalks this month, followed by a Russian spacewalk.\n\n(Image: NASA)\n\nThen five more US-Italian spacewalks will be conducted in November and December to fix a key science instrument.\n\nNASA is calling it a \"spacewalk bonanza\".\n\nThis unusual run of spacewalks will feature the first all-female spacewalk - by Koch and Jessica Meir - later this month.\n\n(Image: NASA HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nThe event has been rescheduled for 21 October 2019, after the first attempt with Koch and Anne McClain had to be cancelled due to lack of spacesuit availability.\n\nKoch is two-thirds of the way through a more than 300-day mission. It will be the longest single spaceflight by a woman.", "description": "The new lithium-ion batteries are so powerful that only one is needed for every two old ones", "authors": ["Sophie Curtis", "Image", "Nasa", "Nasa Handout Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20530300.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP__4439JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
