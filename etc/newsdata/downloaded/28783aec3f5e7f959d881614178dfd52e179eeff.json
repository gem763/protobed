Then I'll get it.\n\n\"Where's my awards? How many UK artists have got a billion streams? Let me know.\"\n\nLorraine Kelly admitted she was baffled and said it didn't make any sense to her that James had not been invited to play.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nJames added: \"I've come from being a front man in a rock band. My dream is to get on them stages. Reading, Leeds, Glastonbruy.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know whether ill get the chance. And I\u2019ve got to come to terms with that.\n\n\"It's not because of my music because I think my music maybe lends itself to those things. Unfortunately there's a touch of snobbery.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThis isn't the first time that James has hit out at Glastonbury organisers for not inviting him to the music festival.\n\nDuring an appearance on This Morning earlier this year, James insisted he was \"made to perform at Glastonbury\".\n\nHe said: \"I think there has been a lot made of it. I would love to be considered I guess credible enough to perform at these things.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I think I was made to perform at Glastonbury and these big festivals. I am a musician. I have worked very hard, it\u2019s been seven years since The X Factor and it\u2019s amazing that I have managed to sustain a career.\n\n\"It\u2019s amazing what the likes of myself, Olly Murs, Little Mix, we have been able to be considered viable enough, to come from a show like that and then still be relevant.\n\n\"There is a little bit of snobbery attached to being from a reality TV show and I think maybe we get overlooked for things like that. For me, it sucks because I believe I am made for those kind of things.\"\n\n*Lorraine airs weekdays on ITV at 8.30am", "description": "James joked that he might have to 'get another number one album' to secure a slot", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20649172.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_RLP_MDG_18785JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
