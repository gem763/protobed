With the exception of trips to Bangladesh, it was the first time they have won three in a row in an Asian country since the 1976-77 visit to India, when Tony Greig's side won 3-1.\n\nAfter two nightmare winters with the ball, Moeen Ali suddenly looks like a potent weapon in England's armoury. In India in 2016-17, he managed 10 wickets at 64 apiece, and during the 2017-18 Ashes it was even worse: five at 115. But his 14 wickets in the first two Tests against Sri Lanka have cost just 21, and his career average of 37 is the lowest it has been for three years.\n\nMoeen Ali's career average of 37 is the lowest it has been for three years\n\nJoe Root's team will finish the series second in the Test rankings, whatever the result of the last game, in Colombo. They were third at the start, but will leapfrog South Africa. Only India lie ahead of them.", "description": "LAWRENCE BOOTH IN KANDY: England clinched a series victory over Sri Lanka on Sunday morning after taking the final three minutes in little over half an hour.", "authors": ["Lawrence Booth For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/18/09/6335748-0-image-a-39_1542534163431.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-18"}
