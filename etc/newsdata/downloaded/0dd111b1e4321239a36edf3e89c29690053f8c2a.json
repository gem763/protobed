Downing Street did not deny the contents of the statement.\n\n\u201cMerkel said that if Germany wanted to leave the EU they could do it no problem but the UK cannot leave without leaving Northern Ireland behind in a customs union and in full alignment forever. She said Ireland is the government\u2019s special problem and Ireland must at least have a veto on NI leaving. Merkel said the PM should tell Northern Ireland it must stay in full alignment forever but that even this would not eliminate customs issues,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cIt was a very useful clarifying moment in all sorts of ways. If this represents a new established position then it means a deal is essentially impossible not just now but ever. It also made clear that they are willing to torpedo the Good Friday agreement.\u201d", "description": "No 10 source says agreement looks \u2018essentially impossible not just now but ever\u2019", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb9ea933436047b382dfd2488f2b728e0f7844c5/196_278_4824_2895/master/4824.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48293a8d6c9d7ebd0dc19e409b70736d", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
