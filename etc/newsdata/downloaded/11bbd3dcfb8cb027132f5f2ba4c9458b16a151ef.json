Sat there, people came and sat down with me, [and] I said, 'OK, what's on your mind?'\" he told Cross Country Checkup host Duncan McCue.\n\nCheckup host Duncan McCue, left, spoke with Mansbridge about his upcoming CBC News documentary, The Way You See It. (Jason Vermes/CBC)\n\nMansbridge says going out on the road and speaking to Canadians has allowed him to see a different side of this year's campaign.\n\n\"I really had people talking to me about what their concerns were and those concerns, in a lot of cases \u2014 not all, but in a lot of cases \u2014 were not focused on themselves; they were focused on their kids,\" he said.\n\nWhether it was climate change, health care, post-secondary education, debt or even immigration, \"they all related to the kind of country we're going to leave for our kids,\" Mansbridge said.\n\n\"I found that different from the past where the focus was always, 'What are [the party leaders] going to do for me?'\"\n\nThe Way You See It: A Peter Mansbridge Special airs Oct. 18 on CBC TV.\n\nTo hear the full Ask Me Anything segment with Peter Mansbridge, download our podcast or click Listen above.", "description": "The veteran CBC News correspondent spoke with Checkup host Duncan McCue about the upcoming election and his new documentary, and took calls from listeners during an Ask Me Anything segment.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5302345.1569808657!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/peter-mansbridge-on-checkup.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
