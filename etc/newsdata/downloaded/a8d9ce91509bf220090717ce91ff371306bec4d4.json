And as we take a closer look at each, remember that all seven of these stocks are not just hedge fund picks \u2014 they also boast the Street\u2019s seal of approval, as reflected in the \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus for each stock (based on the last three months of analyst ratings).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong-Buy Stocks to Consider: Microsoft (MSFT)\n\nStrong-Buy Stocks to Consider: Microsoft (MSFT) More\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe No. 1 stock for hedge funds right now is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Indeed, we can see that funds have a total of $18,131 million invested in MSFT stock right now. That makes it easily more popular than the No. 2 pick \u2014 Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) \u2014 where hedge funds own a total of $16,406 million.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, out of 363 major funds studied by RBC Capital, a sizable proportion (29%) hold MSFT stock in their portfolio.\n\nLuckily for these funds, the Street also has a very bullish outlook on MSFT right now. Out of 23 analysts recently polled, 21 rate the stock a buy, with only one analyst calling it a hold and another saying sell. That gives MSFT its \u201cStrong Buy\u201d Street consensus. Meanwhile, the $154 average analyst price target indicates 10% upside potential lies ahead. Shares have already surged 37% year-to-date.\n\nKeyBanc analyst Brent Bracelin points out that Microsoft has just scored a major $7.6 billion contract award for Pentagon\u2019s cloud migration to Office365. \u201cWe view some of these broader government modernization plans and cloud initiatives as another growth vector for Microsoft\u2019s commercial cloud segment ($38B run-rate growing 43% y/y) and reiterate our Overweight rating on MSFT,\u201d cheered the analyst. He notes that this is the second-largest cloud computing contract from the Pentagon behind the JEDI deal.

In other words, hedge fund ownership rose significantly during Q2 2019, in terms of the net number of funds that added new positions. According to RBC Capital, 14 funds initiated positions in UTX stock in Q2 versus Q1. As a result, 16% of the funds scanned by RBC now hold UTX in their portfolio.\n\nAs far as the Street is concerned, these moves seem to make sense. Four out of five analysts rate UTX stock a buy, while the price target indicates 15% upside lies ahead. Analysts are excited about the proposed merger with Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN). The all-stock transaction will create a new aerospace and defense powerhouse and should close in the first half of 2020.\n\nFive-star Cowen & Co analyst Cai Rumohr is a fan of UTX with, or without, Raytheon. \u201cWe like the proposed RTN merger for technology synergies and enhanced financial flexibility to bolster CFPS [cash flow per share] by 2021. Shareholder approval seems likely this fall given diminished activist resistance, and DoD appears to support the deal,\u201d says the analyst. \u201cIf the merger doesn\u2019t complete, we see UTX moving closer to its est. SOTP [sum of the parts] of ~$155-160/sh. since UTX Aero will be the last large cap commercial aero systems \u201cpure\u201d play.\u201d UTX stock currently trades at $134.", "description": "Hedge funds are a valuable source of investing inspiration.
