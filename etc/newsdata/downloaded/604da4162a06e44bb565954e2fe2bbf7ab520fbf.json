A security official said the intention was to cut off the road \u201cbefore the operation in Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this way, the group\u2019s transit to Syria and support lines, including ammunition, are shut off,\u201d the official said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKurdish fighters make up the bulk of the Syrian Democratic Forces and have been instrumental in helping the United States defeat ISIS fighters in Syria.\n\nTurkey, however, views the Kurds in northern Syria as a terrorist insurgency connected to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, a far-left militant and political group that has been engaged in various states of conflict with the Turkish government for four decades.\n\nAnkara has long threatened a military strike against the Kurds, who hope to set up their own autonomous state near the Turkish border.\n\nIt appears that threat will be acted upon soon after the White House announced late Sunday that Turkey would be moving forward with an offensive into Syria and that U.S. troops would not be in the \u201cimmediate area\u201d when it happens.\n\nPresident Trump Donald John TrumpTrump campaign slams Minneapolis mayor, Target Center for 'attempting to extort' them with rally security fees Susan Rice calls Trump decision to pull troops from Syria 'batshit crazy' Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report MORE then said Monday that he decided to pull back American troops from the area, citing \u201cridiculous Endless Wars.\u201d\n\nThe surprise decision is viewed as an implicit endorsement of Turkey\u2019s plans for the offensive and has been widely criticized in Washington \u2014 including by several Republicans who are typically aligned with Trump \u2014 as an abandonment of a U.S. ally.\n\nFollowing the announcement, U.S. forces left two observation posts at Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain.\n\nBut administration officials on Monday insisted the withdrawal is not giving Turkey a \u201cgreen light\u201d to invade Syria and that the move \u201cdoes not constitute a withdrawal from Syria.\u201d\n\nTrump the same day warned he would \"obliterate\" Ankara's economy if it did anything \"off limits,\u201d but then on Tuesday defended the country as a NATO ally and strong trade partner.\n\nIt was unclear the extent of damage or whether there were any casualties following Turkey's strike on Monday night.\n\nThe strike was a joint operation by Turkey\u2019s intelligence service and the military, but details were contradictory, with one official telling Reuters it was an air strike and another describing the move as making the area \u201cunusable through various means.\u201d\n\nAnkara also said its plans for an offensive into Syria are now in place.\n\n\u201cThe [Turkish Armed Forces] will never tolerate the establishment of a terror corridor on our borders.
