(Stringer/Reuters)\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham has invited Rudy Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s private attorney, to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding alleged corruption in Ukraine.\n\nGraham wrote on Twitter Tuesday that after hearing about \u201cthe many improprieties surrounding the firing of former [Ukrainian] Prosecutor General Victor Shokin,\u201d he would give Giuliani \u201cthe opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has repeatedly alleged that former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden were involved in corrupt practices in Ukraine.\n\nHunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company from 2014 to 2019. The company, Burisma Holdings, was the subject of a corruption probe led by Shokin, who was then prosecutor general of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2016, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin at the urging of U.S. and European Union officials, who agreed that Shokin was himself engaged in corrupt practices.\n\nGraham had initially refused to take any action in the Senate regarding Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine, saying earlier this month, \u201cI want somebody to look at the conflict of interest outside of politics.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump is currently the subject of an impeachment inquiry to determine if he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the allegations against the Bidens by withholding a $391 million military aid package set aside for Ukraine by Congress.\n\nGraham\u2019s offer to Giuliani could set up a conflict between the Senate and House of Representatives, the latter of which has summoned numerous Trump administration officials to answer questions regarding the impeachment probe.", "description": "Senator Lindsey Graham has invited Rudy Giuliani to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding alleged corruption in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Andrew C.
