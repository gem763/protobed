This was a miserable occasion on a miserable night, in a miserable stadium, against miserable opposition \u2013 decorated with a miserable backdrop of recrimination and bad blood.\n\nBut it was also, in its own way, a righteous occasion. Racist abuse in football stadiums has been a source of unhappiness for as long as there has been racist abuse, racist violence and everything else along the spectrum. In Sofia, for the first time, football made a live intervention. It was vile, disturbing and toxic, with the promise of greater violence in the air as the stadium simmered through a deeply unpleasant evening of what was, at times only notionally, international sport.\n\nAt half-time England\u2019s players walked off looking soul-sick. Behind them Bulgaria\u2019s captain, Ivelin Popov, leaned into the wire fencing to appeal to the home fans to stop the racist chanting that threatened to curtail the entire sorry spectacle.\n\nEngland trounce Bulgaria 6-0 but forced into stoppages by racist chanting Read more\n\nFootball has never seen anything quite like this before. The scheduled half-time break was the third stoppage of the game. The previous two will live in sporting infamy as a wretched kind of history was made here in Bulgaria.\n\nThe first intervention came just after England\u2019s second goal of their 4-0 half-time lead. In the England end the sounds of joy and exhilaration were replaced by chants of \u201cYou racist bastards, you know what you are\u201d.\n\nProvocative, perhaps, but also prescient and entirely accurate. The first monkey chants from the home crowd came shortly after with 22 minutes on the clock. They were directed at Tyrone Mings, who took the ball by the touchline and was greeted by a small group of Bulgarians making the hated, hateful noises.\n\nMings made his pass then turned and looked at the crowd. In that moment your heart broke slightly. Here was a man on his England debut, fielding not just the vilest abuse, but a moment that will echo, wretchedly, far beyond this shabby-looking pitch.\n\nMoments later, Gareth Southgate could be seen up on his feet talking to the Uefa official Danilo Filacchione, pointing over at the far side where the noise had come from.\n\nFilacchione spoke into his walkie\u2011talkie as the game paused. And so we waited. Finally, the announcement came over the PA, a thin, anxious, hectoring voice that drew boos and shrieks from the home crowd.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bulgaria fans leave the stadium early during the match against England.

Please be under no mistake the game will be suspended and may be abandoned if the racist behaviour continues.\u201d\n\nWe crawled on horribly. On 40 minutes there was more of the same abuse as Mings took the ball. A three\u2011way conflab between manager, referee and official followed, with Southgate forcefully making his point. Once again the game and the basic idea of sport just fell apart, with more whistles and missiles thrown from the ultras in black at the end close to the Bulgaria goal.\n\nEngland\u2019s players shuffled together protectively. Finally, they walked back out to restart when they might quite easily have chosen to walk off, a decision that drew boos and whistles from the home crowd.\n\nSix minutes of stoppage time for racism, the board flashed up. There was time still for more abuse as Mings took the ball and for the sight of a huge phalanx of riot police, helmets on, to loom up at the side of the pitch. Time also for another goal as Kieran Trippier and Harry Kane (playing a wonderful hand as a creator in the middle of all this poison) set up Raheem Sterling to make it 4-0.\n\nBulgaria\u2019s team had played like a rabble. Their fans had disgraced their country, European football, and indeed deeply embarrassed (it is to be hoped) their president, Boris Mikhailov.\n\nPresumably, Mikhailov\u2019s personal apologies to England\u2019s players will be just as heartfelt as his complaints on Friday that Tammy Abraham had been wide of the mark in assuming that exactly this might happen in Bulgaria\u2019s national stadium.\n\nWill England ever want to come here again? Before kick-off their fans had filled their corner-slice of this sallow concrete bowl with the usual travelling pageantry of St George\u2019s Cross flags. The rest of the stadium was a half-empty husk. No great hardship shutting parts of this ground: the end opposite the banned area remained a sea of empty washed-out green and blue plastic. It made for an eerie, echoey weirdly enervated atmosphere as the teams kicked off.\n\nBulgaria 0-6 England: Euro 2020 qualifier \u2013 reaction Read more\n\nYet in the middle of this there was something majestic about England as they carried on, still being abused periodically but determined to see this through as far as they could.\n\nA fifth goal without reply came, drawing chants of \u201cwho put the ball in the racists\u2019 net? Raheem, Raheem Sterling\u201d, followed by a sixth.\n\nThere will be a reckoning up for the Bulgarian Football Association and sanctions (again) for their fans. A genuine punishment is required this time. It may or may not arrive.\n\nOnly one thing is certain for now: England\u2019s players can be hugely proud of their own grace under pressure on a wretched night.", "description": "England should take great credit for their response to a toxic atmosphere that led to two stoppages for racist chanting on a wretched night for football", "authors": ["Barney Ronay"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a651674ef798622d4abd39db58a6a600a2aac4f0/0_360_3818_2292/master/3818.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f3e947c414c71ac98f1161b8606a7fec", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
