The S&P 500, by comparison, has gained 2% since the June 9 announcement.\n\nInvestors, it seems, aren\u2019t too enthused about the combination, which will create an aerospace and defense giant. Still, Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr is bullish on United Tech\u2019s aerospace division and recommends buying stock in the company today.\n\nOf course, it could be that investors don\u2019t mind the merger, they are just tired of waiting.\n\nUnited Technologies (ticker: UTX) announced in late 2018 that it is breaking into three companies: one dedicated to aerospace, one to air-conditioning and another dedicated to elevators. Only after the three-way split wraps up in the first part of 2020 will the aerospace division merge with Raytheon (RTN). So it could be eight or nine more months before the stand-alone defense and aerospace giant trades publicly. Investors\u2019 patience is being tested.\n\n\u201cInvestors seem fixated on the [Raytheon] merger but under-appreciate major cyclical turns at Otis [and] Pratt, [United Tech\u2019s] recession resistance, and likely [second-half earnings] beats,\u201d von Rumohr said in a Wednesday research report. \u201cWith [the] separation [and] merger on track, transactional overhang should abate, offering upside to our $150 [price target].\u201d\n\nOtis is United Technologies\u2019 elevator division and Pratt is short for Pratt & Whitney, part of United Technologies aerospace division that makes jet engines.\n\nVon Rumohr thinks Pratt\u2019s engine profit margins are going higher because of the company\u2019s product cycle. New engines are sold at low, or no, profit margin because jet-engine makers make money servicing assets over their operating lives. What\u2019s more, early in a product\u2019s life cycle, volumes are often low, leading to poor fixed-cost absorption. It is always better for profitability to sell more volume out of the same facility.\n\n\u201cPratt\u2019s total margin looks set for gradual up trend through 2023,\u201d he wrote. As important, margin improvement, according to the analyst, isn\u2019t dependent on the economy making United Technologies aerospace margins recession resistant.\n\nHe likes the defense deal, too. \u201cWe like the proposed [Raytheon] merger for technology synergies and enhanced financial flexibility to bolster [cash flow] by 2021,\u201d von Rumohr said. He thinks the merger makes strategic sense and upgraded United Tech stock on June 24, a few weeks after the Raytheon merger was announced.\n\nVon Rumohr rates United Tech stock Outperform, the Cowen equivalent of Buy, with a $150 price target, 14% higher than recent levels.\n\nAs the United Tech spinoffs and the Raytheon merger approach, Wall Street will start commenting on the valuation of the individual United Tech pieces. For now, it is hard to say what anything is worth\u2014debt allocations, for instance, between divisions aren\u2019t decided and, of course, there are no share counts for the new entities. William Blair wrote a bullish report on Otis on Tuesday, saying the elevator unit could trade at a better valuation multiple than United Tech does today. Now Cowen is positive on United Tech aerospace.\n\nLooking ahead, investors may be interested in individual units, but they will have to be content with owning the entire company for now because that\u2019s the only thing for sale.\n\nUnited Technologies stock rose 1.6% to $131.05 on Wednesday, better than the 0.9% gain of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com", "description": "Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr is bullish on United Technologies\u2019 aerospace division and recommends buying stock in the company today, not waiting until after its split and subsequent merger with Raytheon.", "authors": ["Al Root"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-103781/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
