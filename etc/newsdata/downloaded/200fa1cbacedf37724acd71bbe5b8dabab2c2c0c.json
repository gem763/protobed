He predicted the resolution would have bipartisan support.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that he agrees with sanctions, \"but I actually think much tougher than sanctions if [Erdogan] doesn't do it in as humane a way as possible\".\n\n191009154735266\n\nWhen asked what he meant by \"humane\", Trump said: \"We are going to have to define that as we go along.\"\n\n\"We will see how [Erdogan] does it. He could do it in a soft manner. He could do it in a very tough manner. And if he does it unfairly, he is going to pay a very big economic price,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump had already promised to \"totally destroy and obliterate\" the Turkish economy if Ankara took any action he considered \"off limits\". He did not elaborate.\n\nThe US has about 1,000 troops in Syria and about 5,200 in neighbouring Iraq.\n\nTrump has long criticised President George W Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003, but the subsequent rise of armed groups like ISIL has convinced many national security officials, and members of Congress that a precipitous US troop withdrawal from the region would leave the US and its allies even more vulnerable.\n\nThe Turkish lira dropped to a near four-month low against the US dollar following report's of Turkey's operation on Wednesday.\n\nLast year, it lost nearly 30 percent against the dollar over concerns about political interference with monetary policy, as well as a deterioration in diplomatic relations between Washington and Ankara over the fate of US pastor Andrew Brunson, whom Turkey had detained on terrorism charges. Brunson was released from Turkish custody last October.", "description": "Trump says he will 'wipe out' Turkey's economy if Ankara wipes out the Kurdish population in Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/5acb81f5d5ce466f9fb8a5d8eb67e8a8_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
