Footage showed him on the sidelines of the rally being grabbed by police and beaten with truncheons before being detained. One of the guardsmen could be seen falling over in the melee.\n\n(This story corrects day to Monday in lead.)", "description": "A Russian court on Monday quashed the jail sentence of an aspiring actor whose conviction for injuring a police officer on the sidelines of an opposition protest triggered a public outcry.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
