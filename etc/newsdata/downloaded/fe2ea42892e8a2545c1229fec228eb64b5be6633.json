Interjecting as Johnson and Trump met for a bilateral meeting on the fringes of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, the U.S. president said: \u201cThat was a very nasty question from a great American reporter. I\u2019m shocked.\u201d\n\nJohnson chipped in: \u201cI think he was asking a question, to be fair, that a lot of British reporters would\u2019ve asked.\u201d (The prime minister has refused to hold a press conference for U.K. journalists.)\n\n\u201cI'll tell you, I know him well, he\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d Trump said of Johnson, to which Johnson agreed: \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d\n\nTrump added that Johnson was \u201cdealing very well\u201d with the verdict of the Supreme Court judges. \u201cI watch it very closely, He\u2019s a friend of mine. I tend to watch friends closer than enemies,\u201d the U.S. president said. And he listed a number of victories he had won over the U.S. courts in a bid to reassure the U.K. prime minister.\n\n\u201cWe won the wall. We won asylum. We\u2019ve won some of the biggest ones. We\u2019ve had a great streak going,\u201d he told Johnson. \u201cWe\u2019ve won a lot of decisions and I\u2019m sure that will happen to you.\u201d\n\nJohnson has vowed to abide by the ruling of the Supreme Court, despite saying he \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the verdict.\n\nTrump also said Johnson was \u201cgoing to make really great progress\u201d on Brexit in \u201cOctober and November,\u201d and that the U.S. would \u201cquadruple\u201d trade with the U.K. after it leaves the bloc.", "description": "\u2018I know him well, he\u2019s not going anywhere,\u2019 says US president after journalist asks Johnson if he will resign.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1170772237-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
