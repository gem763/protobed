De Cos called for a strengthening of banks\u2019 balance sheets and greater levels of efficiency.\n\nBanks in Spain are still suffering from the after effects of reducing toxic legacy assets left on their balance sheets after the country\u2019s real estate bubble burst in 2007, while households are still cutting outstanding debts.\n\nBut De Cos, the current governor of the Bank of Spain, said that a recent reduction in toxic real estate assets had allowed Spanish banks to perform more favorably in this year\u2019s domestic stress tests than last year.", "description": "Consolidation is inevitable among banks in the euro zone, but low profitability and low valuations will make this very difficult, European Central Bank vice-president Luis de Guindos said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440639469&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0K2", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
