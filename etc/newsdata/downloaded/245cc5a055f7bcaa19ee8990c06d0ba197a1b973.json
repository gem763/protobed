Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) speaks to reporters from the doorway of the secure area where impeachment investigation interviews are taking place on Capitol Hill in Washington, Oct. 23, 2019. (Erin Schaff/The New York Times)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans\u2019 move to occupy the secure chambers of the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday may not have succeeded in shutting down Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. But for a day at least, it shifted debate in the Capitol away from damaging testimony against President Donald Trump to questions about how the inquiry itself is being conducted.\n\nTheir goal was to portray the proceedings, conducted by three House committees behind closed doors, as unfair to Trump, to voters and to them. Republicans charged that Democrats had abandoned the precedents of past presidential impeachments by limiting who could take part in the proceedings, and that they were trampling on due process.\n\nSenate Republicans joined in Thursday, when Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, introduced a nonbinding resolution condemning the inquiry and calling on Democrats to open up the process.\n\nBut the secrecy is not uncommon for sensitive congressional investigations, and Democrats say the break with precedent has been driven by the nature of the allegations in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the closed-door process and the dispute it has prompted.\n\n\u2014 Why are Democrats being so secretive?\n\nBecause the Ukraine matter has not been investigated by federal authorities or Congress already, Democrats are trying to nail down the facts before they can determine whether to bring articles of impeachment against Trump, and what such articles should say. Think of it like a grand jury, they have said.\n\nHolding witness interviews in private minimizes political grandstanding by lawmakers and witnesses. It allows professionally trained staff members to ask questions in extended blocks of time, rather than five-minute chunks required in public hearings. And perhaps most important to the investigation, if the testimony remains mostly private, it prevents witnesses from lining up their stories in advance.\n\nThe private nature of the proceedings may well also have helped Democrats secure the cooperation of media-shy career government officials who have offered damaging accounts of Trump\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to turn it into a circus,\u201d Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, said recently in a feisty exchange with his Republican counterpart.\n\nRepublicans may be wary of another benefit to this kind of private digging: It allows Democrats to more carefully control the case they are building, avoiding potentially embarrassing public testimony from witnesses that may undercut or deflate elements of the story they hope to tell.\n\n\u2014 Is there precedent for a closed-door impeachment inquiry?\n\nKeeping the first phase behind closed doors is not just investigative best practice, Democrats assert, but the way federal investigations, whether in Congress or the executive branch, typically take place.\n\nRepublicans have frequently noted that the impeachment proceedings against Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton were open to the public, but in those cases, there had already been extensive federal investigations that provided the backbone for the House\u2019s work. (In the Nixon case, House investigators also did significant investigative work in private before making their public case.)\n\nConfidential interviews have also driven many other high-profile investigations, such as the one opened by Republicans during the Obama administration into the attack on American diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. The Republican leading that inquiry mounted a vigorous defense of his private hearings at the time.\n\n\u201cI can get more information in a five-hour deposition than I can in five minutes of listening to a colleague ask questions in committee hearings,\u201d former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who led the inquiry, told ABC in 2014. \u201cIf it\u2019s about getting the information, then you want to use the investigatory tool that is most calculated and gets you the most amount of information and that\u2019s not five minutes in a committee hearing.\u201d\n\nRepublicans retort that though the Benghazi investigation was serious and implicated Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of State and Democratic presidential nominee, it was not as weighty as an impeachment inquiry.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans' move to occupy the secure chambers of the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday may not have succeeded in shutting down Democrats' impeachment inquiry.
