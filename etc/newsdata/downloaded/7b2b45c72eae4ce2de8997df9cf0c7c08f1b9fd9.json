And even as he claimed a significant national security victory on Sunday, the outcome of the raid did little to quell doubts about the wisdom of his push to reduce the United States military presence in Syria at a time when terrorist threats continue to develop in the region.\n\nMr. Trump has long viewed the United States intelligence agencies with suspicion and appears to see its employees as members of the \u201cdeep state.\u201d He also has a distinctly skeptical view of alliances \u2014 in this case, close cooperation with the Kurds, whom he has effectively abandoned.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe irony of the successful operation against al-Baghdadi is that it could not have happened without U.S. forces on the ground that have been pulled out, help from Syrian Kurds who have been betrayed, and support of a U.S. intelligence community that has so often been disparaged,\u201d Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWhile the raid was obviously a welcome success, the conditions that made the operation possible may not exist in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nTo Mr. Trump, the death of the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was proof of the wisdom of his strategy of defending America at home without committing United States forces to \u201cendless wars\u201d abroad.\n\nTo the president and his supporters, the arguments from critics amount to sour grapes, an effort by an impeachment-crazed opposition to play down the success of a focused, successful clandestine operation that echoed the killing of Osama bin Laden.\n\nThat, of course, was the 2011 moment that Democrats celebrated as proof that a progressive president with little national security experience could take out the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist. And while it had faded a bit in memory by the time President Barack Obama was up for re-election the following year, it was a talking point for his campaign.\n\nMr. Trump seemed to be laying the predicate for his own campaign talking points on Sunday, when he recounted telling his own forces that \u201cI want al-Baghdadi,\" rather than a string of deceased terrorist leaders who were \u201cnames I never heard of.\u201d And clearly he is hoping that the success of the raid has a wider resonance: He sees the al-Baghdadi raid, some former Trump aides said, as a counterweight to the impeachment inquiry, which is based in part on an argument that he has shaped foreign policy for his political benefit.\n\nIt is too early to know whether any political boost will be lasting. But navigating the complex morass of the Middle East is no less complex for the death of Mr. al-Baghdadi. It is not clear if the president\u2019s decision to pull back American forces in northern Syria in recent weeks complicated the planning and execution of the mission.\n\nAnd while the raid achieved its goal, it did little to resolve the question of whether Mr. Trump\u2019s instinct for disengagement will create room for new strains of violent radicalism that he and his successors will be forced to clean up.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the aftermath of the Bin Laden killing eight years ago should also sound a warning.\n\nEven without its leader, Al Qaeda evolved and spread. The Islamic State began its killing spree in the vacuum of the Middle East by early 2014, in both Iraq and Syria. Mr. Trump himself, in the heat of the 2016 campaign, accused Mr. Obama of creating the conditions for a new iteration of Islamic terrorism to prosper.\n\n\u201cHe was the founder,\u201d Mr. Trump said in August 2016, talking about Mr. Obama and ISIS. \u201cThe way he got out of Iraq, that was the founding of ISIS.\u201d\n\nThe history of the Middle East is rife with the rise of extremist movements, and there is no reason to believe ISIS will be the last. Long after the cinematic details of the daring raid \u2014 from its patient beginnings in Iraq last summer to the tense flight into Syria and the chase down a sealed tunnel where Mr. al-Baghdadi met his end \u2014 the enduring question will be whether the Trump administration capitalizes on the moment to address the region\u2019s deep sectarian and political fissures and the underlying causes of terrorism.\n\nClint Watts of the Foreign Policy Research Institute wrote on Sunday that \u201cal-Baghdadi\u2019s death will dash the dreams of an Islamic State centered in the Levant, but its years of operations recruited, trained and dispatched foreign fighters from dozens of countries that will lead the next generation of jihad to other frontiers.\u201d\n\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > \u00a9 Omar Haj Kadour/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\nHe added: \u201cIslamic State-trained foreign fighters will be a future terrorism problem for the decade to come.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama and his administration grappled with that challenge endlessly, and their memoirs are filled with Situation Room meetings searching for an approach beyond drone strikes. But they never solved the problem.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s team, in contrast, rarely discusses it. And that is in part because of the president\u2019s very different philosophy of how to secure the country, one that was on display in his sometimes rambling news conference after the announcement of Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s death.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s approach to the region has never been consistent, but he has struck consistent themes. The first is that the United States does not need to keep forces in the region to reach out and kill its enemies. The high price of occupation, rebuilding and vacuum-filling, he suggests, can be paid by allies, or by Russians, Turks and even the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I say they should start doing a lot of the fighting now, and they\u2019ll be able to,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Sunday. \u201cI really believe they\u2019ll be able to.\u201d\n\nAll the terrorists need to know, he said, is that the United States will hunt them down, if necessary, even from afar.\n\nBut the story of Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s demise is more complex. He was living in territory that was essentially ungoverned space, dominated by two different Qaeda groups \u2014 Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s rivals \u2014 and now an emerging territory for ISIS fighters on the run. The Syrians and the Russians control the airspace.\n\nIt is exactly the kind of area that American military and intelligence leaders \u2014 and the Republican leadership in Congress \u2014 have urged Mr. Trump to keep an eye on by keeping a small force in the country.\n\nDavid H. Petraeus, the former general and C.I.A. director, often says that ungoverned space inevitably becomes extremist space. \u201cLas Vegas rules do not obtain in these locations,\u201d he said this year. \u201cWhat happens there doesn\u2019t stay there.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump does not subscribe to that theory. In his view, American surveillance can keep track of the terrorists from above, while the National Security Agency can bore into their networks.\n\nTo Mr. Trump, a United States military presence on the ground becomes an excuse for others not to act; it does not bother him, he says, that Russia now occupies an area that was essentially an American protectorate before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you who loves us being there: Russia and China,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause while they build their military, we\u2019re depleting our military there.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged the help of some of those governments on Sunday, thanking the Russians first for allowing in the American helicopters, saying that the Kurds \u201cgave us some information,\u201d that Turkey was \u201cnot a problem.\u201d (He did not give a similar heads-up to the congressional leadership that has been pressing for his impeachment, saying, \u201cWashington is a leaking machine.\u201d) While he declined to say where the operation began and ended, it was from Iraqi territory.\n\nBut it is far from clear that, in the absence of American engagement, that access is assured.\n\nThe one exception to Mr. Trump\u2019s disengagement philosophy may come over oil.\n\nMr. Trump said he would not ask American taxpayers to \u201cpay for the next 50 years\u201d of containing mayhem. But in recent days he has indicated he is willing to keep troops around Syria\u2019s oil fields, a consistent exception to the Trump no-troops rule. When the Iraq invasion happened, he noted Sunday, he argued for America to \u201ckeep the oil.\u201d\n\nNow he is making a similar case about the oil in Syria. Oil money fueled ISIS, he notes, and more recently it helps feed the Kurds \u2014 not mentioning that their access to it is being jeopardized by his sudden decision three weeks ago to abandon the American posts along the Turkey-Syria border.\n\nBut in recent days his defense secretary, Mark T. Esper, has indicated Mr. Trump was willing to commit forces to secure the fields, and the president went further on Sunday, saying he intends to \u201cmake a deal with an Exxon-Mobil or one of our great companies to go in\u201d and exploit the field properly.\n\n\u201cWe should be able to take some also,\u201d he said.\n\nThe risk, of course, is that America looks like a force of exploitation, willing to enter hostile foreign lands for two reasons only: killing terrorists and extracting resources. The mission of the American Century \u2014 helping other nations to develop their economies and build democratic institutions \u2014 is missing from the strategy.", "description": "The death of the Islamic State\u2019s leader in a daring nighttime raid vindicated the value of three traditional American strengths: robust alliances, faith in intelligence agencies and the projection of military power around the world.
