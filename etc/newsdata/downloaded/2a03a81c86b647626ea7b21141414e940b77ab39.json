I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a foul.\u2019\n\nVAR did not consider there to be enough contact on Divock Origi (Sky Sports)\n\nSolskjaer also revealed that he is keen for his United side to play more direct following their poor start to the campaign.\n\n\u2018We are better when he attack quickly, no dilly-dallying on the ball,\u2019 said the United manager.\n\n\u2018Playing the ball forward doesn\u2019t have to be a counter attack but you need to be more direct, take more risks, be braver.\n\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if you lose the ball up there because you can win it back.\n\n\u2018Being more direct helped us.\u2019", "description": "Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has aimed a dig at Liverpool's players after they wanted Marcus Rashford's goal to be disallowed during the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford.
