Prices for the Lotus Elise, for instance, start at about \u00a342,000 in England, or roughly $52,000. Prices for the Lotus Evora 400, the only Lotus model currently available in the United States, start at under $100,000.\n\nLotus also doesn't usually boast about enormous horsepower. The battery-powered Evija, however, is being touted as \"the world's most powerful series production road car\" -- if the car can actually deliver Lotus' 1,900 horsepower target once it's produced. The car will be able to go from zero to over 60 miles an hour in less than three seconds and will have a top speed of more than 200 miles an hour.\n\nIn Track mode, a rear wing deploys to improve the car's high-speed performance.\n\n\"The Lotus Evija is a car like no other. It will reestablish our brand in the hearts and minds of sports car fans and on the global automotive stage,\" Lotus chief executive Phil Popham said in an announcement. \"It will also pave the way for further visionary models.\"\n\nThe Evija, which is pronounced \"e-vy-a,\" will be able to drive \"flat-out\" on a race track for at least seven minutes before having to slow down, according to Lotus. Electric cars generally can't operate at full performance for very long before batteries begin to drain and overheat. That's one reason high-performance automakers like Lamborghini and Ferrari have said they are not rushing to produce all-electric cars.\n\nRead More", "description": "Britain's Lotus sports car company, famous for small, light, quick cars, is making an ultra-powerful electric supercar.", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190716110134-01-lotus-evija-super-tease.jpg"}
