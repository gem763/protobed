Even though it's a large public university with over 30,000 undergraduates, Berkeley is often held up alongside more traditionally \"elite\" schools like Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.\n\nOf the 10 U-Cal schools, Berkeley is considered the toughest one to get into. According to data released by the school, just over 87,000 students applied for 2019 and 14,661 were offered admission \u2014 an acceptance rate of 16.8%.\n\nBerkeley students are known for their emphatic school pride and political activism. Some of the most important political protests of the 1960s, including the free speech movement, took root on Berkeley's campus. That political spirit has extended into the current climate, as well. The school made international headlines two years ago when massive protests erupted in anticipation of a speech by the controversial right-wing provocateur, Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\nBut Berkeley students know how to kick back, too. The school's campus is known for its idyllic skylines and expansive hangout areas. In the run-up to finals week, some students take part in a bizarre semesterly tradition called The Naked Run, where hordes of college kids strip naked and run through the libraries. The prank is meant to reduce stress.\n\nTo find out what day to day life is really like for students, Insider spoke to Berkeley class of 2022 linguistics student Irene Yi. The Michigan native agreed to document her day during the first month of the fall 2019 semester.\n\nWhen she's not taking classes to complete her degree, Yi works as a student photographer for the school's public affairs office. Yi's photography job gives her inside access and lets her explore just about every element of Berkeley life, from sporting events and research labs to protests and everyday classrooms.\n\nFollow Yi through UC Berkeley and get a glimpse of what life is like for everyday students.", "description": "Follow Irene Yi, a class of 2022 linguistics major, as she walks you through a typical day at the University of California, Berkeley.", "authors": ["Mack Degeurin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8e4a1721214c3a430e02ec-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
