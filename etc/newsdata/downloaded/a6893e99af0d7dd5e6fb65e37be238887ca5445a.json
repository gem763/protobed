The dual-screened Surface Neo and Surface Duo were the biggest surprises, but those won\u2019t be releasing until holiday 2020, which is over a year away. Frankly, there was a lot to keep up with, and you can easily catch up by watching our quick recap of the event above, or check out the major headlines right here.\n\nMost of the other Surface products that Microsoft announced onstage are available for preorder now, and will be shipping either by the end of October or in November. Whether you\u2019re more interested in the Surface Pro 7, Surface Laptop 3, or the Surface Pro X, we\u2019ve pulled together a few links where you can reserve yours before it releases.\n\nSurface Pro X\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s all-new Surface Pro X is available for preorder at the Microsoft Store. It costs $999 for the base configuration with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage; or you can get 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $1,499. Its optional accessories include the Type Cover that\u2019s made uniquely for the Pro X for $139.99, and the new Surface Slim Pen for $144.99. Microsoft will sell a bundle of the two together for $269.99, saving you around $15.\n\nMicrosoft will launch the Surface Pro X on November 5th. The company said that these might sell out quickly, so you may want to preorder sooner than later if you want it to arrive by the holidays.\n\nCompared to the Surface Pro 7 that uses Intel processors, the Surface Pro X hosts the new SQ1 processor engineered by Microsoft and Qualcomm. Microsoft says that this machine should be three times faster than the current MacBook Air, and it features built-in LTE so you can stay connected practically anywhere.\n\nSurface Pro 7\n\nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 7 is available for preorder right now at Microsoft Store. It starts at $749, and Microsoft is releasing several configurations that quickly ramp up in cost. If you want a Type Cover keyboard, it will cost an extra $129.99. The release date for the Pro 7 is October 22nd, so you won\u2019t have long to wait for your order to arrive.\n\nThe Surface Pro 7 looks like last year\u2019s model, but it has a few tweaks that might make it worthwhile for you. Notably, it charges via USB-C instead of its previous Surface Connector. My colleague Tom Warren went hands-on with the new machine, and he has the spec breakdown:\n\nThe Surface Pro 7 includes Intel\u2019s latest 10th Gen processors, and you\u2019ll be able to pick from a dual-core i3 version or quad-core i5 and i7 models. The base model starts with just 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and you can go all the way up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.\n\nSurface Laptop 3\n\nThe Surface Laptop 3 is available for preorder right now at Microsoft Store, and will ship on October 22nd. For the first time, it comes in two sizes: 13.5 and 15 inches, starting at $999 and $1,199, respectively.\n\nThere\u2019s more that\u2019s different here than just a new size. The 13.5-inch model features Intel\u2019s 10th Gen processors and USB-C charging. In addition, for the first time, you can decide between having an Alcantara-covered or an all-aluminum keyboard. The 15-inch model is the first Surface product to feature an AMD processor. The Verge\u2019s Tom Warren went hands-on with this model, as well, and broke down the specs:\n\nThe new chip is an AMD-based Surface Edition of the Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7, with an extra core on the graphics processor over the standard Ryzen chips. It can be paired with up to 32GB of RAM, which is 16 more than the maximum you can get in the 13-inch model. Oddly, the storage options top out at 512GB. (The 13-inch model can be equipped with up to 1TB of storage.)", "description": "Microsoft announced the Surface Pro X, Surface Pro 7, and Surface Laptop 3, and you can preorder each of them right now.
