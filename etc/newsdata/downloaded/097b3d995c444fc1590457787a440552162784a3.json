He also didn't want to join ALDE because he didn't want to be associated with the word \"liberal,\" which is often used negatively in France to imply ultra-capitalism.\n\n\u201cI deeply believe that ... Europe cannot allow itself the luxury of vain quarrels and small fights or to add internal crisis to the tensions of the world\" \u2014 Emmanuel Macron, French president\n\nBut even after teaming up with the main liberal ALDE family in the European election, he still declined to attend pre-summit meetings. That set him apart from other leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has almost never failed to attend a meeting held by the European People\u2019s Party, of which her CDU party is a member.\n\nInstead, the French president used his party's high score in the European election to rebrand ALDE in the Parliament as Renew Europe (ALDE still exists as a wider European liberal group). His appearance on Thursday appears to show that Macron is ready to embrace the EU's liberal family.\n\nAn invite to this week\u2019s meeting sent out by the head of Renew Europe in the European Parliament, Dacian Ciolo\u0219, says \"the President of the French Republic, the Prime Ministers, the Vice-President of the European Commissioners\" will meet in Brussels ahead of the European Council.\n\nFirst up will be a session with Macron, liberal prime ministers and political leaders before a discussion on Brexit with Guy Verhofstadt, the Brexit coordinator in the Parliament, Jo Swinson, the new leader of the U.K.'s Liberal Democrats, and Miche\u00e1l Martin from Ireland's Fianna F\u00e1il, according to one Renew Europe organizer. Then it's a lunch meeting with Macron, prime ministers, Ciolo\u0219 and Margrethe Vestager, who'll be one of the new European Commission's executive vice presidents.\n\nMacron\u2019s attendance will also be an opportunity for him to secure support after the rejection by MEPs of Sylvie Goulard, his close ally and France's pick for the next Commission.\n\nMacron and Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission president-elect, believed that MEPs, in deference to Paris, would confirm Goulard as a sort of super-commissioner overseeing a wide portfolio that spanned from defense to technology, despite Goulard facing investigations over alleged financial misconduct.\n\nLast week, Macron blamed leaders of rival political groups for the rejection of Goulard, and noted that she had been the personal choice of von der Leyen.\n\nOn Sunday, Macron spoke out against political infighting in the Parliament following Goulard\u2019s rejection. Accusations have been flying that Goulard was rejected as revenge by the European People's Party after Macron led the charge against the EPP's initial pick for Commission chief, Manfred Weber.\n\n\u201cI want us to be able to work together, with Chancellor [Angela] Merkel and the future President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, to build a strong European Commission based on a solid majority in the European Parliament that we all have the responsibility of building and comforting,\u201d Macron told reporters alongside Merkel.\n\n\u201cI deeply believe that in this particular moment, Europe cannot allow itself the luxury of vain quarrels and small fights or to add internal crisis to the tensions of the world \u2026 our strength resides in our unity, our capacity to have ambition for our future,\" Macron added.", "description": "French president will no longer resist taking part in pre-summit meetings of leaders.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Rym Momtaz"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175085626-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
