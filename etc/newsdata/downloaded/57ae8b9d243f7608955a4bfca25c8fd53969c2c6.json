In the accompanying letter to the worldwide episcopate, Pope Benedict was at pains to draw \u201cattention to the fact that this Missal was never juridically abrogated and, consequently, in principle, was always permitted.\u201d Always permitted. And yet for forty years after the first public celebration of Pope Paul\u2019s New Mass on October 24, 1967\u2014a Biblical epoch of suffering\u2014the Church groaned under the burden of the falsehood that the traditional Mass had been abrogated, or \u201cobrogated\u201d (eliminated by substitution) as the neo-Catholic establishment now contends in a hasty revision of its discredited propaganda. Concerning that propaganda, we must never forget that neo-Catholic apologists for the post-conciliar revolution insisted for decades that \u201ccelebration of the Tridentine Mass is forbidden except where ecclesiastical law specifically allows it.\u201d (Likoudis and Whitehead, The Pope, the Council, and the Mass, 1982, 16, 67-68; 2000, 68) (my emphasis). The Church\u2019s received and approved rite of Mass, the very substance of the living Faith of our Fathers, forbidden. So they told us, until Pope Benedict exposed the lie. The Rise of the Legislating Church Since Paul VI never actually abrogated the traditional Mass\u2014an act that would have been \u201cquite alien to the spirit of the Church,\u201d as the former Cardinal Ratzinger put it\u2014whence did this monstrous fraud originate? The answer lies in the bureaucratization of the Roman Curia and the Church at large during the wave of \u201creforms\u201d following the Second Vatican Council. As Michael Davies observed in his landmark study of the liturgical revolution, \u201cthe Conciliar Church could well be termed the legislating Church\u2026 It has become a bureaucracy for the sake of bureaucracy and has given up any pretense at evangelizing the de-Christianized masses in Western countries in favor of producing an endless stream of legislation to regulate a diminishing number of the faithful.\u201d (Pope Paul\u2019s New Mass, 21-22).\n\nCommunion in the Hand Novelty in the Name of the Pope Note well the paradox Davies identified: more and more legislation for fewer and fewer faithful. Over the past five decades the Church has suffered the decomposition of the human element of the ecclesial commonwealth in a manner paralleling that of the fall of Rome, with its proliferation of laws accompanied by a loss of societal integrity. Cardinal Ratzinger called it a \u201ccontinuing process of decay.\u201d (L\u2019Osservatore Romano, November 9, 1984). As Chesterton famously observed of this sort of process: \u201cWhen you break the big laws, you do not get freedom; you do not even get anarchy. You get the small laws.\u201d The post-conciliar \u201creformers\u201d broke some very big laws indeed, first and foremost the law of the Church\u2019s organic liturgical development, thus producing what the former Cardinal Ratzinger has called \u201ca break in the history of the liturgy, whose consequences could only be tragic.\u201d (Milestones, p. 148). Thereafter followed the endless stream of little laws by which the Legislating Church has systematically ruined the Roman Rite. The destruction of the Roman Rite was entirely a bureaucratic operation that Pope Paul VI allowed to run amuck before he finally sacked the infamous Bugnini on suspicion of Freemasonic affiliation and packed him off to Iran in 1976. But the ill-starred Pope acted far too late to undo the incalculable damage Bugnini had done in the process of what he himself had called \u201ca major conquest of the Catholic Church\u201d two years earlier. (Davies, \u201cHow the liturgy fell apart: the enigma of Archbishop Bugnini,\u201d AD2000 Vol. 2 No 5 (June 1989), p. 17). As Davies showed, there are only \u201ctwo papal acts included among the plethora of over 200 post-conciliar acts of liturgical legislation.\u201d (Ibid., 23). Those two papal acts were the Motu Proprio Sacram Liturgiam (January 25, 1964), which opened the floodgates to optional vernacular translations of the New Mass that the bishops soon made de facto mandatory, and Missale Romanum (April 3, 1969), the Apostolic Constitution by which Pope Paul promulgated the Latin typical edition of his new Missal, but without abrogating the old Missal. In fact, every single particular of the vernacular Novus Ordo, including the de facto abolition of the Latin liturgy, is the work of Bugnini, his bureaucratic collaborators, and their successors down to the present day, toiling away in the new congregations, pontifical commissions, national bishops\u2019 conferences, and local liturgical commissions created during the post-conciliar \u201creforms.\u201d A careful study of the matter reveals that not one of these liturgical innovations was ever imposed upon the Church by an affirmative papal act binding the faithful to embrace it. The entire liturgical revolution\u2014from vernacular translations to altar girls\u2014has proceeded by way of optional novelties approved by hierarchs and bureaucrats at various levels of the Legislating Church. Altar Girls:\n\nNovelty in the Name of the Pope\n\nThe altar girl debacle is a prime example of the consequences of the rise of the Legislating Church. The permission for altar girls came by way of advice from the newly constituted Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (CDW) in 1994. The CDW resulted from the unification of the Congregation for Divine Worship, newly created by Paul VI in 1969, with the previously existing Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments. (It was Pope Paul\u2019s decision to place Bugnini in charge of the CDW that led to the liturgical vandalization of the Church.) In approving altar girls, the CDW passed the buck to the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative Texts (PCILT), created by John Paul II in 1988 to replace the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of the Decrees of the Second Vatican Council, created by Paul VI in 1967. According to the PCILT, the newly adopted Canon 230 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law permits altar girls pursuant subsection 2, which provides: \u201c\u2026. All lay persons can also perform the functions of commentator or cantor, or other functions, according to the norm of law.\u201d (Cf. Circular Letter to the Presidents of Episcopal Conferences from Pontifical Council for Interpretation of Legislative Texts, Prot. n. 2482/93, March 15, 1994, Notitiae 30 [1994] 333-335). Notice that the authorization of altar girls, which overturned 2,000 years of traditional practice, was found to be lurking in a provision of the Code of Canon Law apparently construed as if it were a civil statute containing broadly permissive legal language with no mooring in ecclesiastical tradition. Here we see the peril involved in the promulgation of \u201ccodes\u201d of Church law as if they were civil statute books\u2014a peril Brian McCall has explored on these pages. Demonstrating precisely the positivistic peril of canonical codes, which are subject to legislative modification and repeal, an article in The News York Times hailing the advent of altar girls quoted a Manhattan priest and canonist to the effect that \u201cCanon law changes by some people being out on the cutting edge\u2026 The practice may not be congruent with the regulations, but regulations catch up with custom.\u201d (NYT, April 15, 1994). That is, the Legislating Church, like any civil legislature, will modify or repeal its laws to keep pace with the times. According to the CDW\u2019s 1994 advisory, \u201cPope John Paul II confirmed the [PCILT] decision and ordered its promulgation,\u201d but there is no written evidence or other particulars concerning this \u201corder,\u201d such as the date it was purportedly given. Further, the papal \u201corder\u201d approving altar girls contradicted the papal order reflected in Inestimabile Donum, the 1980 instruction by which the CDW advised that \u201cWomen are not, however, permitted to act as altar servers\u201d and that \u201c[t]his instruction\u2026 was approved on April 17, 1980, by the Holy Father, John Paul II, who confirmed it with his own authority and ordered it to be published and to be observed by all concerned.\u201d No explanation has ever been offered for the Pope\u2019s purported reversal of his own prior order. Evidently, it was deemed sufficient merely to report that the Legislating Church had repealed its prior legislation, and that the Pope had endorsed the repeal. The Luminous Mysteries :\n\nNovelty in the Name of the Pope\n\nSo, it is the Legislating Church, not papal commands as such, that has produced the \u201cauto-demolition\u201d belatedly lamented but never undone by Paul VI or John Paul II. Only Benedict XVI has attempted to overrule something of what the Legislative Church enacted during the prior two pontificates. He has liberated the Latin Mass from its bogus prohibition by the Legislating Church; and, at long last, he has ordered correction of numerous blatant errors in the vernacular translations of the Novus Ordo that the Legislating Church, acting through the Vatican bureaucracy, the International Commission on English in the Liturgy, the bishops\u2019 conferences and other organs, had foisted on the faithful for decades. Those errors include tampering with the very words of Our Lord Himself at the first Mass, when He declared that the fruits of the Holy Sacrifice are offered \u201cfor many\u201d\u2014that is, for the elect unto salvation as the Council of Trent declared\u2014not \u201cfor all,\u201d as the Legislating Church would have it. The Pope as Captive of the Legislative Church But it seems Pope Benedict feels he can do little to enforce his will against opposition by operatives of the Legislating Church both within and without the Curia, including bishops who resent any infringement of their legislative prerogatives under the \u201cnew model\u201d of collegiality. Hence the traditional Mass continues to be hermetically sealed off like anthrax in most dioceses, despite the Pope\u2019s clearly expressed will that every priest in the Western Church have recourse to the 1962 Missal without need of episcopal permission. And the national hierarchies of Italy and Germany are openly defying correction of the defective vernacular translations of the New Mass. The Pope\u2019s letter to the head of the German Bishops\u2019 Conference, Archbishop Robert Zollitsch, regarding the pro multis issue is a prime example of papal impotence before the Legislating Church. The Pope advises Zollitsch that \u201cthe Holy See has decided that in the new translation of the Missal, the words \u2018pro multis\u2019 should be translated as they stand, and not presented in the form of an interpretation.\u201d That is, the Pope presents as a mere \u201cdecision\u201d\u2014a decision of the Legislative Church\u2014that there should be a return to the correct rendering of the words of Our Lord at the first Mass, thereby rectifying an error not found even in Protestant versions of the Bible. The Pope also expresses concern about \u201cthe danger that\u2026 some parts of the German language area will keep the translation \u2018for all,\u2019 even though the German Bishops\u2019 Conference had agreed to use \u2018for many\u2019, as was desired by the Holy See.\u201d There is not the slightest suggestion that the Pope has any authority to command correction of the error as required by fidelity to the Gospel and his own duty as Vicar of Christ. Rather, this is all a matter of agreement between organs of the Legislating Church: the Holy See on the one hand, and the German Bishops\u2019 Conference on the other. Nowhere in the letter does the Pope express his own will as Roman Pontiff, adverting only to what the Legislating Church has decided and agreed. The depth of the current ecclesial crisis is reflected in the Pope\u2019s subsequent comment in defense of the \u201cdecision\u201d to translate Our Lord\u2019s words correctly: If this decision makes a great deal of sense, as I hope it does, in terms of the fundamental relationship between translation and exegesis, I am also aware that it poses an enormous challenge to those with the task of explaining the word of God in the Church, since to the ordinary church-goer it will almost inevitably seem like a rupture at the heart of the sacred. They will ask: did Christ not die for all? Has the Church changed her teaching? Can she do so? May she do so? Are there reactionary forces at work here to destroy the heritage of the Council? Liturgical Dance :\n\nNovelty in the Name of the Pope Notice how the Pope, writing in tones almost apologetic, implicitly accepts the premise that the \u201cheritage\u201d of the Second Vatican Council is somehow at variance with the bimillenial \u201cTridentine\u201d theology of the Mass as a sacrifice that avails only the elect, not all men, unto salvation\u2014which is why Our Lord said \u201cfor many\u201d and not \u201cfor all.\u201d And it is breathtaking to see the Pope seriously pose the question whether a return to a faithful translation of Our Lord\u2019s words reflects the influence of \u201creactionary forces\u201d seeking to \u201cdestroy the heritage of the Council\u201d\u2014forces that would repeal what the Legislating Church has enacted to update her teaching in keeping with the all-important conciliar aggiornamento. The Pope appears to cater to the idea that the Council is exactly what he said it should not be when speaking as Cardinal Ratzinger: \u201can end of Tradition, a new start from zero.\u201d (Address to Chilean Bishops, 1988). Even more disturbing is the Pope\u2019s subsequent rhetorical question: \u201cThe question immediately arises: if Jesus died for all, then why did he say \u2018for many\u2019 at the Last Supper? And why do we retain these words of Jesus for the institution?\u201d Why do we retain the words of Jesus? The Church \u201cretains\u201d them, of course, because they are His words and she has a divinely imposed duty not to tamper with them. The Pope does go on to say that the Church employs the phrase \u201cfor many\u201d out of \u201cdeference for Jesus\u2019 own words, in order to remain literally faithful to him. Respect for the words of Jesus himself is the reason for the formulation of the Eucharistic Prayer.\u201d But surely this is not a matter of mere \u201cdeference\u201d to or \u201crespect\u201d for Jesus. The Church has a sacred obligation to obey the Godhead by conveying His Gospel without alteration. \u201cDeference\u201d and \u201crespect\u201d connote discretion not to defer or respect. It is precisely this discretion that the Legislative Church has claimed for itself and to which\u2014irony of ironies\u2014Benedict now defers by pleading for acceptance of the Holy See\u2019s \u201cdecision\u201d to return to what Our Lord actually said versus what opposing elements of the Legislative Church would prefer Him to have said. The Pope continues with an observation whose irony could not be more exquisite; and one wonders how the irony could have been lost on the Pope: We all know from experience of the last fifty years how deeply the alteration of liturgical forms and texts touches people\u2019s souls. How greatly perturbed people will be, then, by a change in the text at such a key moment. This being so, when the decision was made to opt for the translation \u201cmany\u201d, in view of the difference between translation and explanation, it was established at the same time that a thorough catechesis would be needed to prepare the way for this translation in the various language regions: the bishops would have to help the priests, and through them the lay faithful, to understand exactly what this is about. Prior catechesis is the essential condition for adoption of the new translation. But where was this concern for the effect of liturgical changes upon the souls of the faithful during the pontificates of Paul VI and John Paul II, when the entire Roman Rite was dramatically altered with patently disastrous results and without the least attempt at \u201ca thorough catechesis\u2026 to prepare the way\u201d? And notice that here again the Pope reduces the duty to convey faithfully the words of God Himself at the first Mass to a mere \u201cdecision\u2026 to opt for the translation \u2018many\u2019\u201d\u2014another nod to the prerogatives of the Legislating Church versus the Church of Sacred Tradition. Yes, Prime Minister! Cardinal Bertone Master of Novelty in the Name of the Pope I will conclude by noting another layer of the problem of the Legislating Church. A key element in the bureaucratization of the Roman Curia during the pontificate of Paul VI was the elevation of the Vatican Secretary of State to the status of virtual prime minister of the Church\u2014that is, prime minister of the Legislating Church, for the Secretary of State is no part of the divine constitution of the Church founded by Our Lord on the Rock of Peter. In 1967-68, under the authority of Pope Paul\u2019s apostolic constitution Regimini Ecclesiae Universae, the Curia underwent a dramatic restructuring designed and implemented by then Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Jean-Marie Villot, another suspected Mason. The aim was to eliminate, as much possible, what we are now told is the old \u201cmonarchical model\u201d of the Church in favor of the new \u201cmodel\u201d of collegiality. Before the Council, the Curia was indeed structured along monarchical lines. The Pope was Prefect of the Holy Office, to which all other Vatican dicasteries were subordinated, while the Cardinal in charge of the day-to-day business of the Holy Office was the Pro-Prefect, reporting directly and only to the Pope. The Pope, as Vicar Christ on earth, was thus at the head of a chain of command over which he wielded his authority directly or through the Holy Office. Under the \u201creform\u201d engineered and carried out by Villot, however, the Holy Office was renamed, becoming the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF)\u2014the name \u201cHoly Office\u201d being far too old-fashioned for the Church\u2019s \u201cnew orientation\u201d after the Council. The Cardinal Secretary of State was placed above all the Vatican dicasteries, including the CDF. Worse, the Pope was no longer Prefect of the former Holy Office, which (as the CDF) would now be under a Cardinal Prefect organizationally subordinated to the Secretary of State. In short, Paul VI \u201cenhanced the powers of the Secretary [of State], placing him over all the other departments of the Roman Curia.\u201d (Cf. \u201cCardinal Secretary of State,\u201d http://en.wikipedia.org /wiki/Cardinal_Secretary_of_State). Since the Council the Vatican Secretary of State has been constituted a kind of Vicar of the Vicar of Christ, with a resulting functional detachment of the new Legislating Church from direct papal control. This decidedly unfavorable development was only exacerbated by John Paul II\u2019s apostolic constitution Pastor Bonus, which declares broadly: \u201cThe Secretariat of State provides close assistance to the Supreme Pontiff in the exercise of his supreme office.\u201d The First Section of the Secretariat of State is accorded sweeping authority, including the authority \u00b7 to draw up and dispatch apostolic constitutions, decretal letters, apostolic letters, epistles, and other documents entrusted to it by the Supreme Pontiff; \u00b7 to prepare the appropriate documents concerning appointments to be made or approved by the Supreme Pontiff in the Roman Curia and in the other institutes depending on the Holy See\u2026 \u00b7 to prepare for publication the acts and public documents of the Holy See in the periodical entitled Acta Apostolic\u00e6 Sedis; \u00b7 through its special office commonly known as the Press Office\u2026 to publish official announcements of acts of the Supreme Pontiff or of the activities of the Holy See; \u00b7 to oversee the newspaper called L\u2019Osservatore Romano, the Vatican Radio Station, and the Vatican Television Centre. \u00b7 to collect, organize[], and publis[] all data, set down according to statistical standards, concerning the life of the whole Church throughout the world. Thus the Secretary of State, as Prime Minister of the Legislating Church, has been vested with all but total control over the flow of legislation and other information emanating from the Vatican, including the very acts of the Pope himself. \u201cYes, Prime Minister!\u201d is the new order of things in the post-conciliar Church. Indeed, as John Vennari has noted, the episodes of that hilarious British comedy series furnish a remarkable allegory of the state of the Church today, in which politics takes precedence over reality. We have even seen the Secretary of State asserting control over publication of the Third Secret of Fatima, arrogating to himself\u2014in an utterly surreal development\u2014authority to \u201cinterpret\u201d the vision of the \u201cbishop dressed in white\u201d as a mere depiction of events in the 20th century, culminating in the failed attempt on the life of John Paul II in 1981. In the Vatican\u2019s official booklet accompanying publication of the vision on June 26, 2000, the former Cardinal Ratzinger defers repeatedly to the \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the vision by former Secretary of State Cardinal Angelo Sodano: \u00b7 \u201can interpretation, the main lines of which can be found in the statement read by Cardinal Sodano\u201d \u00b7 \u201cIn this regard, Cardinal Sodano stated: \u201c[the vision] do[es] not describe photographically the details of future events, but synthesize[s] and compress[es] against a single background facts which extend through time in an unspecified succession and duration.\u201d \u00b7 \u201cthe interpretation offered by Cardinal Sodano in his statement of 13 May was first put personally to Sister Lucia\u2026.\u201d \u00b7 \u201cFirst of all we must affirm with Cardinal Sodano: \u2018... the events to which the third part of the \u2018secret' of Fatima refers now seem part of the past.\u2019\u201d We must affirm with Cardinal Sodano? What authority does Cardinal Sodano have over the Message of Fatima? None but what the Legislating Church purports to give him, which in reality is no authority at all, as the Legislating Church is not the Church that Our Lord founded, but rather a collection of bureaucratic fiefdoms which in no way participate in the Church\u2019s charisms of indefectibility and infallibility in matters of faith and morals. Yet Sodano was absurdly vested with the status of the oracle of Fatima\u2014and this at the very moment he was facilitating the cover-up of the Father Maciel scandal, as he had been throughout the 1990s. (See the damning report \u201cThe Allegations Against Cardinal Sodano\u201d in Catholic World Report, May 4, 2001). For the Legislating Church and its Prime Minister, the Fatima event is a public relations problem to be managed, not a heaven-sent prophesy and warning for the Church and mankind. And Sodano\u2019s successor, Cardinal Bertone, continues unswervingly in the Secretary of State\u2019s party line on Fatima: that the Message of Fatima in general and the Third Secret in particular \u201cbelong to the past.\u201d Our Lady of Fatima, the Secretary of State assures us, had nothing to say about the ecclesial disaster of the past half-century. The \u201cVatileaks\u201d Scandal\n\nThe 'Spirit of Vatican II' Set UP a Regime of Novelty in Peter's Name The dominance of the Secretary of State over the affairs of the Legislating Church has been revealed to the whole world in the scandal now raging over the contents of private correspondence to the Pope leaked from the papal apartment by the Pope\u2019s majordomo (head of household), Paolo Gabriele. Among the leaked items is a most revealing letter to Cardinal Bertone from Cardinal Leo Raymond Burke, who is head of the Apostolic Signatura (the Catholic Church\u2019s highest tribunal) and is also a member of the CDW. In an article dated June 3, 2012, the Italian daily La Repubblica quoted excerpts from Burke\u2019s letter, which protests the recent (January 2012) approval by the Pontifical Council for the Laity\u2014yet another of the proliferating organs of the Legislative Church\u2014of \u201cthose celebrations contained in the Catechetical Directory of the Neocatechumenal Way which do not appear by their nature to be regulated already by the liturgical books of the Church.\u201d What precisely this ambiguous approval covers has been the subject of controversy ever since\u2014a result all too typical of post-Vatican II pronouncements by Vatican departments. Seizing on the ambiguity, the two founders of \u201cthe Way\u201d\u2014that famous pair of neo-Catholic kooks, \u201cKiko\u201d Arguello and Carmen Hernandez\u2014are claiming approval of the neo-Catechumenal liturgy as such. But, quite tellingly, the CDW, which has jurisdiction over the liturgy, was not involved in this \u201capproval.\u201d Hence Cardinal Burke\u2019s letter to Secretary of State Bertone objects to an invitation Burke had found on his writing desk, announcing a ceremony marking the \u201coccasion of the approval of the liturgy of the Neocatechumenal Way.\u201d Wrote Burke: \u201cI cannot, as Cardinal and member of the Congregation for Divine Worship, fail to express to Your Eminence the astonishment the invitation has caused me. I do not recall ever having heard of a consultation [with the CDW] regarding the approval of the liturgy as such of this ecclesial movement. I have received in recent days from various persons, including a respected bishop in the United States, expressions of concern regarding such a papal approval. This news had been for me pure rumors and speculations. Now I have discovered that they were correct.\u201d As reported by La Repubblica, the letter ends with Cardinal Burke\u2019s declaration that \u201cAs a faithful student of the teaching of the Holy Father on the liturgical reform that is fundamental to the new evangelization, I believe that such liturgical innovations, even after the correction by the Prefect of the [CDW], do not seem consistent with the liturgical magisterium of the Pope.\u201d In a further revelation, John Allen of National Catholic Reporter reports that the Pope read and then attached a handwritten note to Burke\u2019s letter, stating: \u201cReturn to Card. Bertone, inviting Card. Burke to perhaps translate these very correct observations in the Congregation for Divine Worship.\u201d Yet these \u201cvery correct\u201d observations by Cardinal Burke concerning the Pope\u2019s teaching on the liturgy have not impeded what is now being trumpeted as \u201cVatican approval\u201d of the bizarre liturgy of the Neocatechumenal Way, which includes dancing around an altar table, consecrated Hosts the size and consistency of personal pan pizzas which crumble and leave numerous particles on the floor, lay preaching in the form of \u201cresonances,\u201d standing throughout a \u201cEucharistic Prayer\u201d accompanied by guitar music, and the reception of Holy Communion while standing in the pews. A Revealing Incident How is it that the Vicar of Christ is reduced to the suggestion that Cardinal Burke\u2019s \u201cvery correct observations\u201d concerning the abuses of the Neocatechumenal \u201cliturgy\u201d be translated for the benefit of the CDW? Why does the Pope himself not intervene directly to put a stop to the liturgical atrocities of \u201cthe Way\u201d of Kiko and Carmen? Indeed, why does the Pope not simply govern the Church directly, restoring good order in keeping with the Power of the Keys that is his, and his alone? The answer is revealed by an incident of which I was reliably informed during a recent Ignatian retreat at the Retreat House of the Society of Saint Pius X in Ridgefield, Connecticut. During an audience with the Pope, Bishop Fellay found himself alone with the Pope for a moment. His Excellency seized the opportunity to remind the Pope that he is the Vicar of Christ, possessed of the authority to take immediate measures to end the crisis in the Church on all fronts. The Pope replied thus: \u201cMy authority ends at that door.\u201d (Castel Gondolfo August, 2005) Today it appears that the Vicar of Christ has become a captive of the democratization of the Church according to a model of \u201ccollegiality\u201d that purports to replace the monarchy which the papacy established by Christ the King really is. It seems that the Pope views himself as but a cog, albeit the biggest and most important cog, in the vast clockwork of a Legislating Church whose \u201cdecisions\u201d must be allowed to operate autonomously and by consent of the governed in keeping with the collegial and democratic mechanisms of the new model. No longer seeing himself as a monarch with the prerogatives and peremptory authority of a monarch, the Pope of the Legislating Church feels constrained to rely on mere suasion and appeals to procedural due process in the hope of effectuating what he wishes to see done. \u201cThey have uncrowned Him,\u201d as Archbishop Lefebvre so famously observed of Christ the King. And thus have they uncrowned His Vicar as well. A crownless Vicar of Christ stands at the turbulent center of the still-reigning chaos in the Church. Only when the papal crown is restored will the good order of the Church be restored with it. Pray, then, that the Pope will have the courage to replace the crown that Christ has given him to wear.", "description": "Vatileaks and other Iceberg Tips", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://remnantnewspaper.com/images/cardinal-bertone.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
