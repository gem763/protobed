The \u201cbroth\u201d is made with black milk tea.\n\nHerrine concludes that the dish tastes like conventional bubble tea but with more indistinguishable tapioca-pearl flavours.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video\n\nHerrine Ro: Vancouver, British Columbia, is known for its boba. Bubble tea, pearls, however you want to call it. There are hundreds of bubble-tea shops serving variations of the Taiwanese drink throughout the city. But one spot in particular serves bubble tea in a way we\u2019ve never seen before.\n\nHerrine: This is what bubble tea hot pot tastes like.\n\nHerrine: This is the taro ball dessert hot pot. Since its conception in early 2019, it\u2019s become a viral sensation. And for good reason.\n\nYang Zhao: We combine the Chinese food and the Western food together. We just focus on the local customer very well. We open two year and a half ago. Vancouver area have a lot of bubble-tea shops, right? So the bubble tea is more and more popular. And every time you go to the shop, they don\u2019t have enough of the taro ball inside. We created this idea, like, three or four months ago.\n\nYang Zhao: Then we think about the utensil, how to display to the customer. So we tested out a single idea and finally think, oh, why not use a hot pot to put all the desserts, everything, inside.\n\nHerrine: The taro ball hot pot, otherwise known as the boba hot pot, or dessert boba hot pot. As a customer I think you can customise your dessert hot pot, your boba hot pot of your dreams, if you will. The options are, choice of one soup base, cold or warm. I\u2019m gonna go with warm. \u2018Cause there\u2019s just something comforting about, like, a warm boba in your mouth. Does that sound wrong?\n\nHerrine: And then the options are caramel milk tea, milk tea, coconut milk, or ginger milk. I\u2019m gonna go with milk tea because that\u2019s what I would get in my boba drink.\n\nHerrine: The next option is include taro-ball toppings: One: stuffed taro balls, signature taro balls, or mini-Q taro balls. I\u2019m just gonna say yes to all three.\n\nHerrine: Choice of three add-on toppings. Red bean, cold grass-jelly cubes, sago, taro, coconut jelly, peanuts, black-sugar pearls, vanilla ice cream, and watermelon. I don\u2019t know what sago is, so I\u2019m gonna try that. Cold grass-jelly cubes is kind of like what they\u2019re known for, \u2019cause they make it in house. I think they make actually every boba in house here. It wouldn\u2019t be boba without some black-sugar pearls.\n\nHerrine:Finally, choice of two dipping sauces. Strawberry, chocolate, condensed milk, honey, mango. Again, I\u2019m gonna pick all of them. We\u2019re just gonna go against the rules here.\n\nYang: When the customers saw on the Instagram, they\u2019re very interested, like, oh, that\u2019s a twist of bubble tea, right? So they come here. Then they try the flavour, and the the milk base is very, very good.\n\nSydney Kramer: If you get scared of the fire just let me know.\n\nHerrine: OK. This seems like a very shareable, like, cosy kind of, like, dessert hot pot. Hot pot\u2019s supposed to be a very, like, social kind of food and so I wish I had more friends to eat this with.\n\nHerrine: I love the DIY aspect of this, too. Like, every time you get a scoop you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re gonna get.\n\nHerrine: This is about the most creative way I have ever drank, ate boba. Where to start, where to start? I\u2019m gonna try these mini little pearl things first. They\u2019re so soft. Because they make all of their, like, jellies in house, they\u2019re super plush and soft and not chewy. Literally the options are limitless here.\n\nHerrine: When you go to a boba place, you can get, like, a variety of different toppings. I love how at this place they\u2019re just like, why not have them all.\n\nHerrine: I wanna try this grass jelly. Because I\u2019m not all too familiar with this. \u2018Kay. Thank you for bearing with me for that. It\u2019s super light. And gelatinous. And herby. But the overall flavour is kind of, there is none.\n\nHerrine: There is so much boba in my bowl right now that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m getting any, like, distinct, real flavourings, all kind of, like, melding in my mouth. But texturally it\u2019s so fun. There\u2019s these little, like, gelatinous bobas. And they\u2019re kinda chewy. And then you get these chunks of watermelon. And then the creaminess of the milk tea. It\u2019s just kind of like, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in your mouth but you are enjoying it every step of the way.\n\nHerrine: So these little white beads, I don\u2019t know what they are. So I looked it up online. And it says, \u201cSago is a starch extracted from the spongy centre, or pith, of various tropical palm stems, especially that of Metroxylon sagu.\n\nSydney: Was that helpful?\n\nHerrine: I still don\u2019t know what it is.\n\nHerrine: Originally I thought this was chunks of Spam. And I was like, why is Spam going into this dessert boba hot pot? But turns out it\u2019s just taro, so myth debunked. It tastes like a sweet potato and potato, like, hybrid. And it\u2019s kind of, like, denser and a little grainier.\n\nHerrine: This is like high tea with boba. This is, like, the most extra, fancy way of consuming boba, and I am here for it. I mean, there\u2019s a throne right in front of the entrance. There\u2019s a grand piano right behind me. And the whole place is decked out with, like, crystal chandeliers and Victorian-era memorabilia. This whole experience has just been a lot more than what I was ever hoping for.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
