WeWork said in a statement that its board will be expanded and control how Neumann's shares are voted.\n\nReuters first reported on Monday that Neumann was negotiating stepping down from the board and would serve as an adviser.\n\n\"The consulting arrangement is mind boggling. It's terrible governance,\" said Nell Minow, vice chair of shareholder advisory firm ValueEdge Advisors. \"Why pay the guy who got WeWork into this mess for advice. It's adding insult to injury and a little more injury too.\"\n\nNevertheless, some WeWork investors said they supported the deal.\n\n\"Adam is a visionary who has created an impactful company which has transformed the way many people work, live and think. We think he deserved to take some money off the table for his contribution to the company,\" said All Blue Capital managing partner Matt Novak.\n\nHe declined to say how big his firm's stake in WeWork is.\n\nSoftBank said it will provide a $5 billion debt package to WeWork, comprising $1.1 billion in senior secured notes, $2.2 billion in unsecured notes, and a $1.75 billion letter of credit facility. WeWork picked SoftBank's offer over an alternative $5 billion debt package submitted on Monday by JPMorgan.\n\nSoftBank said it will also accelerate a previous $1.5 billion equity commitment to WeWork in the form of warrants that are due in April at a new price of $11.60 per share.\n\nSoftBank said it will own 80% of WeWork following the tender offer but will not be consolidating the company on its books because it will not hold a majority of voting rights. SoftBank will have four board seats on the company's expanded 10-member board, one of the source said.\n\nSoftBank and its first $100 billion Vision Fund already owned about a third of WeWork through previous investments totaling $10.6 billion.\n\nAll of the Vision Fund's interests in regional joint ventures with WeWork outside of Japan will be exchanged for shares in WeWork at $11.60 per share, SoftBank said.\n\n\"We hope SoftBank can execute on this enhanced vision, through leveraging its strategic partnerships, or otherwise, and bring back value to WeWork's minority shareholders,\" said All Blue Capital's Novak, adding his firm will be holding on to its stake because it views SoftBank's tender offer price as too low.\n\nWeWork abandoned its initial public offering last month, after investors questioned its large losses, the sustainability of its business model and the way it was being run by Neumann, who gave up his CEO title last month. He had retained his position as chairman of the We Company.\n\nSoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure will succeed Neumann and become The We Company's executive chairman.\n\n\"The new capital SoftBank is providing will restore momentum to the company and I am committed to delivering profitability and positive free cash flow,\" Claure said in a statement.\n\nArtie Minson, previously WeWork's chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, who was a vice chairman at the company, are now serving as its co-chief executives.\n\nPOOR GOVERNANCE\n\nWhile Neumann's investors were willing to entertain his eccentricities since co-founding WeWork in 2010, his free-wheeling ways and party-heavy lifestyle came into focus once he failed to get the company's IPO underway.\n\nDuring the attempts to woo IPO investors last month, Neumann was criticized by corporate governance experts for arrangements that went beyond the typical practice of having majority voting control through special categories of shares.\n\nThese included giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donated to charitable causes. Neumann had also entered into several transactions with WeWork, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent.\n\nNeumann, 40, is not the first founder of a major startup to be forced to step down recently.\n\nUber Technologies (NYSE: ) Inc co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned as CEO of the ride-hailing startup in 2017 after facing a rebellion from his board over a string of scandals, including allegations of enabling a chauvinistic and toxic work culture.\n\n\"I view this as SoftBank's moonshot to get WeWork back on all fours,\" said Eric Talley, professor of law at Columbia Law School. \"They realize that Neumann's continued involvement in the company would be a continued impediment to that.\"", "description": "SoftBank clinches WeWork takeover deal, bailing out co-founder", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9M04F_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
