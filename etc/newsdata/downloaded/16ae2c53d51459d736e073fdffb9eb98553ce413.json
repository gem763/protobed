But the negative comments are increasingly likely to blast the amount of time devoted to slavery, decrying \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and the bashing of a giant of American history. Two years ago, only a couple of the poor reviews mentioned slavery. This year, almost all of them do.\n\n\u201cFor someone like myself, going to Monticello is like an Elvis fan going to Graceland,\u201d one review from July reads. \u201cThen to have the tour guide essentially make constant reference to what a bad person he really was just ruined it for me.\u201d\n\nThe Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society is a staunch opponent of Monticello\u2019s decision to tell visitors Jefferson fathered children with Sally Hemings, after years of fierce disagreement over the strength of the evidence. John Works, a Jefferson descendant and president of the society, believes Monticello has overemphasized slavery at the expense of Jefferson\u2019s accomplishments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a limit to the appeal, I think, of the slavery message,\u201d he said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com History Plantations-Are-Talking-More-About-Slavery-Grappling-With-Visitors-Who-Talk-Back"], "top_image": ""}
