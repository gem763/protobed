So we think it could still go higher from here.\u201d\n\nInvestors are grappling with the impact of the trade dispute that\u2019s showing signs of weighing on an already fragile global economy. While Kaloo doesn\u2019t expect Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to resolve the spat anytime soon, credit growth within China is showing signs of rebounding amid policy efforts to get money flowing around the slowing economy.\n\n\u201cThe ability to be able to get a deal struck -- and one that sticks -- is nigh on impossible,\u201d he said in separate comments in Sydney on Friday. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think the U.S.-China trade thing is likely to be successfully resolved, certainly there will be no large deal achieved.\u201d\n\nKaloo, who has spent almost 20 years at Aberdeen and has been in charge of global equities since 2015, expects details on stimulus plans to be announced at the Fourth Party Plenum next month.\n\n\u201cI suspect on the back of that they are going to be announcing some pretty big stimuli,\u201d he said.", "description": "China Stocks May\u00a0Rise Even Without a Trade Deal, Aberdeen Standard Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice025d7f36712a06f696fbf0e017b5737.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
