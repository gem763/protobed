REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nIn the coming week, Washington will be hosting a delegation of Chinese trade officials in the latest face-to-face test of wills, by far his preferred way of resolving trade stand-offs.\n\nOver 60% of analysts polled by Reuters see a deterioration of U.S-China trade ties - not least because the poll also showed a broad view that the yuan will slip to a new decade low against the U.S. dollar by year-end, fuelling U.S. accusations that China is manipulating its currency.\n\nThe WTO meanwhile welcomes up to 3,000 trade experts next week officially to debate how it should respond to a changing world, but they are all too aware that the Geneva-based body is facing the biggest threat in its 24-year history.\n\nIn just over two months, the WTO\u2019s appellate body, which rules on international trade disputes, will be left with only one judge after Washington\u2019s repeated refusal to accept new appointments.\n\nFor long the champion of world trade, the United States is threatening the very dispute settlement system that on Wednesday rewarded it with the right to levy tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU products over illegal subsidies to Airbus (AIR.PA).\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s (USTR) office welcomed the award and Trump described it as a \u201cnice win\u201d. But few are under any illusions that Washington is about to adopt a more consensual course.\n\n\u201cIf you read the press statement from USTR... it\u2019s the best advertisement for the WTO appellate body that anyone could possibly have written,\u201d an EU diplomat said of a text that sounded on the surface like a ringing endorsement of it.\n\n\u201cBut I think we have to assume there will be no appellate body after Dec. 10.\u201d\n\nThe European Union will likely win similar damages next year in a parallel case over subsidies for U.S. planemaker Boeing (BA.N). But for the time being the EU is the loser, the champion of rules-based trade exposed as a rule breaker and now facing U.S. tariffs on a range of its exports.\n\n\u201cThis is awkward for Europe,\u201d said one non-EU diplomat. \u201cThe United States are supposed to be the bad guys.\u201d\n\nDispute settlement is not the only field where multilateralism is under threat. The WTO\u2019s \u201cDoha Round\u201d of negotiations, designed to lower global trade barriers, stalled long ago, but the organization has pressed ahead with talks on e-commerce and fish subsidies.\n\nHowever, the fish talks have also stalled because the 164 WTO members cannot agree on who should chair the committee to discuss the issue.\n\nGLOBAL RULES ON SUBSIDIES\n\nIn the 15-year-old aircraft dispute, both sides have expressed a willingness to reach a settlement, but this is unlikely to happen any time soon, and certainly not before the United States expands its trade offensive with new tariffs on EU products on Oct. 18.\n\nAt the same time as the two battle over aircraft subsidies, they and Japan are in talks about revising global rules on subsidies as a whole, hoping to find a formula to curtail Chinese backing of its state-controlled companies. Two years of talks have so far not yielded results.\n\n\u201cSome of the parties have realized that strong and comprehensive discipline on subsidies to rein in China risks unintentionally also including their own domestic subsidies,\u201d said Hosuk Lee-Makayama, director of trade think tank ECIPE.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH FOR NEXT WEEK\n\nAll eyes will be on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when he speaks in Denver on Tuesday. Till now, he has described the pair of Fed rate cuts since July as a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment\u201d rather than the start of a full-blown easing campaign. That stance is being tested by the southward turn in the latest round of data on the U.S. economy, although Friday\u2019s read-out of moderate September jobs growth may reassure some.\n\nWhether any progress is being made on the effort to lift U.S. inflation should also become clearer in the week ahead, with data on both producer and consumer prices due out.\n\nNext week is a big one for Germany-watchers, with industrial output, industrial orders and trade figures. In the UK, August GDP data on Thursday should give some idea of whether the UK is heading for a negative Q3 GDP reading and a technical recession.\n\nIn Paris, the OECD think-tank will release on Wednesday much-anticipated plans to overhaul international tax rules aimed at ensuring that big internet companies pay a bigger share.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A logo is pictured outside the World Trade Organization (WTO) headquarters next to a red traffic light in Geneva, Switzerland, October 2, 2018.
