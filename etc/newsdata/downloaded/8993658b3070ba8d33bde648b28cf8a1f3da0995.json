'But then you come back to tonight and it seems very similar to the start of the season.\n\nIt\u2019s like a team of strangers, it\u2019s like they\u2019ve never played with each other before. There\u2019s no link between the midfield players and the strikers. The weight of pass at times was so bad.\n\n'You want to be encouraged you want to see some bits of good play now and again, a one-two here and there, the number 10 receiving the ball on the half turn, but there\u2019s a lack of encouragement.'\n\nUnited struggled to create clear cut chances and Scholes says they lack creativity in attack\n\nScholes also criticised United's defence, who afforded the hosts several good opportunities\n\nPhil Jones partnered Harry Maguire at centre-back in Belgrade and struggled as he made just his third start of the season and Scholes was also critical of United's rearguard and lack of ingenuity.\n\n'I think defensively they were quite poor as well tonight,' he added. 'Second half there was only one team that looks like scoring. I don\u2019t see anything. A lot of the games they\u2019re going to have the ball but they have to be cleverer.'\n\nUnited's win was their first on the road since they beat Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League back in March and leaves them top of Europa League Group L with seven points from three games.", "description": "Paul Scholes accused Manchester United of playing 'like a team of strangers' and lacking creativity after their 1-0 win over Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League on Thursday.", "authors": ["Alec Fenn For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/20/20149682-0-image-a-33_1571945637505.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
