Even though these sectors are mature, the need for more storage, computing power, and connectivity among all devices will still increase.\n\nMeanwhile, the ever-increasing computing power in automobiles gives technology companies newfound growth opportunities. As automobiles add more features powered by technology and as autonomous capabilities reach their potential, investors cannot ignore this trend.\n\nAdvanced driver-assistance systems (or ADAS) technology employs such solutions as AI-based applications, active driver monitoring, and blind-spot detection. As the low latency 5G rolls out, these vehicles may connect to the cloud to call on intelligent features or to run analytics.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor the investor, finding stocks that will benefit from the surge in ADAS requires balance. Some stocks are priced with high P/E multiples in anticipation of the explosive growth ahead. But if automobile manufacturers are on-track to offer ADAS and governments allow them on the street, these suppliers will enjoy strong revenue growth.\n\nIn no particular order, here are seven autonomous vehicle stocks to hold to drive you to the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbarella (AMBA)\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmbarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) enjoyed expanding sales in both the professional and consumer markets for IP security cameras. Designing its CVflow SoCs in the next generation of AI cameras is paying off. But its bigger ambitions are in the automotive market. In July, Hyundai Mobis said it would use Ambarella\u2019s A9AQ Automotive SoC.\n\nThe company is seeing an increased interest in its computer vision SoCs for commercial vehicles. Ambarella\u2019s CVflow solution enables vehicles to have both active driver monitoring and blind-spot detection. Multiple providers in Asia and the U.S. selected its CVflow solution in the second quarter.\n\nAmbarella forecasts a realization in CV revenue in the current third quarter. It raised its Q3/2020 revenue above the Street consensus from $63 million to $67 million. The automotive segment will lead to the sequential increase. This strong segment will offset the volatility in consumer electronics. As the company expects a decline in the percentage of consumer electronics revenue in the next two to three years, automotive will fill that void.\n\nGetting CVs in automotive is still a longer-term story, so investors interested in holding AMBA stock should have a long-term time horizon. So, getting traction for its CVs first in the recorder business will follow with the chip\u2019s adoption in the cabin monitor, drive monitor, and e-mirror space.\n\nOn the risk side, Hangzhou Hikvision, a video surveillance product supplier, getting blacklisted by the Trump administration on Oct. 7 could cause Ambarella to lower its near-term revenue forecast. Dahua, its second-biggest customer, is also on the list. This setback pulled the stock lower and creates an entry point for investors who missed the last rally.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) Mobileye broke ground at the Jerusalem plant and once the facility is completed, will have 50,000 square meters. Even though it won\u2019t be ready until 2022, Intel is already enjoying growth in the autonomous driving market.\n\nIn the second quarter, the combined IoTG and Mobileye business grew 22% year-on-year. Mobileye\u2019s revenue and operating margin rose 16% and 20%, respectively. Penetration in autonomous driving lifted the unit\u2019s results in the second quarter. The strong results offset weakness in Intel\u2019s core businesses. And when its memory business revenue fell 13% due to oversupply of NAND, the company needed continued market share growth in autonomous driving to keep investors happy.", "description": "The technology sector is hardly worried about the persistent slowdown in smartphone and computer demand.
