These constraints, Lammy said, meant his constituents \u201cno longer feel sovereign in their own homes\u201d. Johnson, agreeing, said: \u201cPeople do feel anxious about imposing discipline on their children, whether the law will support them. I think parents should be seen as the natural figures of authority in this respect.\u201d Bear in mind this was ages before we had got to know his more prominent parent, minor celebrity Stanley Johnson, or witnessed the pointed absence of Johnson Jr\u2019s own children at moments of career glory, so it probably came across quite differently. Johnson added: \u201cThere should be a clear statement from the government that the benefit of the doubt should always be given to parents.\u201d\n\nAssuming Dominic Cummings approves and Johnson himself has not, since 2012, decided that children deserve the same protection as animals, that recently acquired enthusiasm of his, there is reason for pro-smacking organisations \u2013 these do, really, exist \u2013 to hope. With Johnson, the parent-assailant\u2019s friend, at the helm, maybe the new Scottish ban on hitting children, bringing it into line with most EU member nations, will not lead to similar protections for English, Welsh and Northern Irish minors.\n\nWhile the rest of the world moves on, the ancient right to physically punish an infant \u2013 being scrupulously careful, of course, not to bruise, graze or over-redden tender skin \u2013 could yet endure as another proud token of UK or, in particular, English, exceptionalism.\n\nIt must help, too, that at least one leading Johnson sibling has acknowledged the bracing role of corporal punishment in their early lives. Boris Johnson\u2019s mother \u2013 the \u201cequal worth of every human being\u201d paragon abruptly invoked in his conference speech \u2013 was also, according to his sister Rachel, a spirited disciplinarian. Following one minor prank: \u201cMy mother stormed out into the garden and chased us until we fell to the ground, then she went about us with a stick as we lay laughing in the grass.\u201d She, in turn, has smacked \u201cand I can honestly say that it didn\u2019t do me or my children in turn any harm\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rachel Johnson: \u2018My mother stormed out into the garden and chased us until we fell to the ground, then she went about us with a stick as we lay laughing in the grass.\u2019 Photograph: James Veysey/REX/Shutterstock\n\nWhile we can\u2019t be sure of the prime minister\u2019s own smacking credentials, his willingness to hurl his prodigious bulk at small children in notionally friendly kickabouts indicates a promising disregard for both their fragility and feelings. And David Cameron recalls, from the idyllic, pre-Brexit days, the time when he had to stop the footy at Chequers, Johnson having hurt his own son: \u201cThere was a little crunch.\u201d\n\nBut before the prime minister gets to take all the credit, it\u2019s important to recognise the efforts made by the Labour party, well before Johnson\u2019s intervention, to ensure that children, unlike adults, should not be afforded protection from violence in British homes. Or, at least, from what Labour\u2019s apologists sometimes called \u201ca loving smack\u201d.\n\nNo religious fundamentalists (\u201cThe rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame\u201d) could have been more determined than Labour in defying, among bodies opposed to corporal punishment by parents, children\u2019s commissioners, the NSPCC, the Council of Europe, a children\u2019s march, the UN committee on the rights of the child. Current UK law, now with the exception of Scotland, still breaches article 19 of the UN convention on the rights of the child, protecting children \u201cfrom all forms of physical or mental violence\u201d. In 2008, Labour saw off an amendment, from Kevin Barron, the Labour chair of the Commons health committee, that would have anticipated Scotland\u2019s prohibition. The then children\u2019s minister, Beverley Hughes, said the party would not \u201cmake smacking a crime and criminalise decent parents for a mild smack\u201d.\n\nThe ancient right to physically punish an infant could yet endure as yet another proud token of English exceptionalism\n\nIdentically threadbare arguments \u2013 as if the courts and police stations in 57 more enlightened countries were daily submerged beneath doting hand-tappers \u2013 have been heard in recent years from MPs and other bodies opposing the Scottish ban, notwithstanding ever more compelling, evidence-based arguments for legislative leadership. John Finnie, the Green MSP who brought forward the new law on behalf of a coalition of children\u2019s charities, last week cited research indicating \u2013 maybe not that surprisingly \u2013 that physical chastisement, as well as being useless and setting a terrible example, harms children as they grow up and into adult life. The \u201cloving smack\u201d, we learn, is no exception. \u201cChildhood physical punishment,\u201d Dr Tamasin Knight briefed MSPs, \u201cis linked to adult aggression and antisocial behaviour, including aggression and sexual violence within intimate partner relationships.\u201d\n\nWith pro-smackers already organising \u2013 stand by for, among others, BBC thinker Anne Atkins and assorted religious literalists, along with Westminster\u2019s nanny-state obsessives \u2013 it\u2019s perhaps unrealistic to expect the Scottish advance to expedite a similar freedom from attack for English children (a ban in Wales looks imminent). The Spectator\u2019s Brendan O\u2019Neill, recently heard inciting riots, has already testified, re Scotland, that he was repeatedly smacked: \u201cAnd damn I needed it.\u201d No harm done. \u201cIf you tell me my parents assaulted me, it\u2019s very possible I will assault you.\u201d\n\nAnd if it would be preposterous to imagine that the prime minister, currently yelling about surrender, banging his pudgy fists on lecterns and picturing the Speaker \u201cforced\u201d to eat a kangaroo\u2019s testicle, suffered any lasting harm from his thrashings, parental and pedagogic, the impressive research that helped bring about Scotland\u2019s new law suggests that not every recipient of loving smacks is so fortunate. Why would they be? No one would make a similar claim for adult survivors of domestic rage or violence. Harm is done. Unless certain parts of the UK do, indeed, confer a very special kind of child immunity.\n\n\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist", "description": "As Scotland moves on, the young in the rest of Britain will continue to suffer", "authors": ["Catherine Bennett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8349594b33ddd1975406a4abbed6325d5383e916/0_600_2630_1577/master/2630.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=888c67fa9196fe89e9b1f997367ff8fb", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
