The administration accuses Iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons. The Islamic Republic, in return, maintains that U.S. sanctions are aimed at helping enemies like Saudi Arabia steal Iran\u2019s oil market share.\n\nIf a U.S.-Iran deal is struck, it could, over time, bring to the global market another million barrels per day from Tehran. That would be the worst nightmare of oil bulls as it would risk unraveling the painstaking work done by OPEC over the past nine months in enforcing disciplined production cuts that restored crude prices from one of their most torrid selloffs since the financial crisis.\n\nAside from Iran, Venezuela, another country under U.S. sanctions, might benefit too from Bolton\u2019s departure, as Trump seeks to extend export waivers to U.S. energy companies still doing business in the Latin America country, while he tries to flush out its dictator leader, Nicholas Maduro. Bolton had vocally opposed that plan.\n\nTrump, in a tweet announcing the sacking of Bolton, his third national security advisor, said he \u201cdisagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration\u201d.\n\nIf anything, Bolton\u2019s influence in the administration was long gone, particularly after Trump\u2019s decision in June to veto the national security advisor\u2019s call for a military strike against Iran as retaliation for Tehran\u2019s shooting down of a U.S. drone aircraft. The New York Times remarked that things came to a head between the two men in recent days after Bolton waged a last-minute campaign to stop the president from signing a peace agreement with leaders of the radical Taliban group.\n\nWTI 15-Min Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nOn Tuesday, oil prices rightly reflected market worries over the possibility of the post Bolton-ouster scenarios, rather than optimism fostered by the new Saudi energy minister. U.S. and , the global benchmark, settled lower for the first time after rising a cumulative 7% over four straight days.\n\nThe oil rally could resume in the coming days though, as traders await the possibility of continued strong weekly draws for U.S. crude and of interest rate cuts by the European and U.S. central banks.\n\nSplit Chance For U.S.-Iran Talks\n\nPundits were split over the chance of talks between Washington and Tehran, let alone a summit between Trump and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani, after their polarizing views and mutual grandstanding on sovereignty.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday they remained committed to Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran.\n\nBut the president himself said nothing, other than his tweet about Bolton\u2019s services not being required anymore at the White House.\n\nThat told oil market strategists such as John Kilduff that Trump may have a longer game of poker in mind with Iran.\n\nThe president said in the past he was open to \u201cunconditional talks,\u201d an offer the Iranians had scoffed at before increasing hostilities against other oil shippers in international waters that led to more tensions with the U.S.\n\nSaid Kilduff, founding partner of the New York energy hedge fund Again Capital:\n\n\u201cWith a warmonger like Bolton breathing down his neck before, it was a lot harder for Trump to even float the idea of an Iran deal. Now, it'll be a lot easier.\u201d\n\nWith An Iranian Deal, Trump Could Gloat On The 2020 Campaign Trail\n\nReferring to the president\u2019s campaign for reelection in November next year, Kilduff said:\n\n\u201cNever mind that there was an original Iranian nuclear deal from the Obama era. Trump might see a chance to do his own deal with Iran that he can gloat about when he goes on the stump for 2020.\u201d\n\nHe also cautioned that an Iran free of sanctions on its oil could flood the market quicker than thought:", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: Brent Oil Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
