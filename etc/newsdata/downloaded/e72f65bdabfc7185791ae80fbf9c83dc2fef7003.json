[Photo by ZOU HONG/CHINA DAILY]\n\nA new exhibition at the Capital Museum offers a kaleidoscopic vision of the key moments in Zhejiang's history, Wang Kaihao reports.\n\nCovering an area of around 100,000 square kilometers, the eastern coastal province of Zhejiang is not particularly large by Chinese standards, yet its rich history offers a panoramic insight into how Chinese culture formed, developed-and ultimately revived.\n\nThanks to the exhibition, The History and Culture of Zhejiang Province, running at the Capital Museum in Beijing, visitors can \"travel\" through seven millennia and delve into the ancient history of this eastern province in detail.\n\nAccording to curator Yu Jiaxin, more than 400 exhibits are on loan from 20 museums from Zhejiang for the exhibition. A quarter of the artifacts are registered as national-level cultural relics.\n\n\"If you visit museums in Zhejiang now, you'll probably feel a little bit disappointed because many of their most treasured artifacts have been sent here,\" she says, smiling. \"While many of the highlighted artifacts enjoy the privilege of having their own exhibition cases back home, due to the limited space in our exhibition hall, many of them have to share the same room.\"\n\nWith such a densely populated showcase, the exhibition offers a kaleidoscopic vision of the key moments in Zhejiang's history.", "description": "A new exhibition at the Capital Museum offers a kaleidoscopic vision of the key moments in Zhejiang's history, Wang Kaihao reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/08/5d9bde8fa310cf3e979ffc15.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
