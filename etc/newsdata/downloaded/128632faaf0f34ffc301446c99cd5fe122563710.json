John McCain John Sidney McCainRep. Elijah Cummings to lie in state in Capitol GOP senators frustrated with Romney jabs at Trump Meghan McCain gets a birthday message from 'crush' Paul Ryan MORE who represented Arizona in the U.S. Senate for three decades, also shared her concerns for the future of the GOP, accusing Republicans of turning their backs on an \u201copen tent\u201d model for the party.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis concerns me very much, and I\u2019ll speak from my own home state where the party has simply left normal, what we would consider normal Republicans, behind,\" Cindy McCain said. \"Until our party goes back to what we were best at \u2014 and that was an open system, an open tent, we invited everybody in \u2014 those are the days that I grew up in Republican politics, and those were good years.\"\n\nDiscussing what she said were some of Trump's \"controversial\" decisions, she called out other Republican lawmakers for not speaking out against the president. She said her husband \u201cgave cover to a lot of people\u201d by often criticizing the president.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has done some things, that you know, that all of us, as Meghan said, they\u2019ve been controversial. They\u2019ve been different from what any other president has done and not in good ways. And yet nobody says anything. Nobody scolds him for what really was bad manners or whatever you want to call it, whatever issue it was of the day,\u201d McCain said.\n\nThis is not the first time Cindy McCain has recently criticized the GOP. Earlier this year, on the one-year anniversary of her husband\u2019s death, McCain said she thinks her late husband would \u201cbe very disappointed\u201d by politics today.\n\n\"We had time to talk before he died and he was very frustrated with what was going on then.
