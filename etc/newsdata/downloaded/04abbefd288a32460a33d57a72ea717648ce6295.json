Skateboarding pioneer Tony Hawk, who does commentary and analysis on the webcasts of tour contests, attended the unveiling earlier this week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a mission to try to put in as many skateparks as possible and leave a legacy behind and help create a hub for emerging talent,\u201d Bobby Gascon, Vans\u2018 director of global marketing, said in a phone interview.\n\nThis year\u2019s tour started on a temporary course in Shanghai and continued at a skatepark built last year in Sao Paulo, Brazil. New skateparks were built for the stops in Montreal, Paris and Salt Lake City.\n\n\u201cFor us it\u2019s what kind of moves the needle,\u201d Gascon said. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing about inspiring and showing them what can be done, but enabling is part of the brand ethos, including enabling creativity.\u201d\n\nBarros, 24, grew up in Florian\u00f3polis skating everything from a dirt road on his way to school, to streets and skateparks. He said the Vans tour is leaving a positive legacy for a sport that\u2019s always been on the fringes.\n\n\u201cSkateboarding has been in the underground for like over 40 years now and a lot of people don\u2019t understand what it is,\u201d said Barros, who won the Vans tour stops in Sao Paulo and Montreal. \u201cA lot of people look at skateboarders as outlaws or rebels. We get looked down on by society because we\u2019re skateboarders a lot of times. If you put a park in a city or a neighborhood, it gives them everything - friendship, family, opportunity, and that\u2019s already a lot.\u201d\n\nThe Vans world championship comes a week before World Skate\u2019s world championships in Sao Paulo, which will serve as one of several qualifying events for the Olympics.\n\nBarros said he\u2019s not getting too wrapped up in his Olympic prospects just yet, or even using this contest as a warmup for next week\u2019s contest.\n\n\u201cIn the end this is all about skateboarding and getting together with your friends and pushing the bar of a lifestyle we live and support and love,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the main goal always.\u201d\n\nArmanto, 26, who lives in Oceanside, California, said she learned to skate at a local skatepark in Santa Monica.\n\nShe said she\u2019s been focusing on contests this year after working on videos the previous year or so.\n\n\u201cAll the best girls are pretty much here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe level of skating has gone up tremendously, especially because of the Olympics. It\u2019s really cool to see the level of women\u2019s skating stepping up.\u201d\n\nShe holds dual U.S.-Finnish citizenship and said she\u2019ll try to qualify for Finland in order to open up a spot for another American.\n\n\u201cIn skateboarding I feel it doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re from, it\u2019s what you do,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me it\u2019s important that the best skateboarders show up in the 2020 Olympics.\u201d\n\nA total of 80 spots will be available for the Olympics, with 20 per event, which include men\u2019s and women\u2019s park and street.\n\n\u201cWhen we created the park series, that influenced the IOC\u2019s decision in introducing skateboarding in Tokyo in park and street,\u201d Gascon said. \u201cThey saw the power we had. Obviously we cover all the continents and have prize parity, with men and women both involved. The level in women\u2019s participation in park is really compelling. We\u2019ve built something robust and powerful and compelling, that\u2019s easy to understand.\u201d\n\nThe men\u2019s and women\u2019s champions each receive $30,000.\n\nThe men\u2019s and women\u2019s semifinals were Friday and the finals are Saturday. The live stream featuring Hawk\u2019s commentary begins at 2 p.m. EDT Saturday at vansparkseries.com.\n\n___\n\nFollow Bernie Wilson on Twitter at https://twitter.com/berniewilson\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Vans' decades-long involvement in skateboarding continues this weekend when Brazilian Pedro Barros, Californian Lizzie Armanto and dozens more top athletes compete in the Vans Park Series Pro Tour World Championships at a new skatepark in Salt Lake City.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
