Photo: NBC\n\nLinda Porter, star of NBC\u2019s Superstore, died at the age of 86 Friday following an illness. Her representation confirmed the actress\u2019s death to The Hollywood Reporter. Porter appeared on the ensemble sitcom as Myrtle Vartanian, the sweet, befuddled, sometimes chaotic Cloud 9 sales associate whose firing, rehiring and use as the basis for a holographic in-store greeter made her one of the show\u2019s comedic highlights. Kicking off her on-screen career at the age of 55 in an episode of Beauty and the Beast, Porter\u2019s previous television roles include turns on Gilmore Girls, 2 Broke Girls, The Mindy Project and American Horror Story, among many others.\n\nShe also appeared as a gambler, billed as Lady Slot-Addict, whose life gets completely turned around by Dale Cooper in David Lynch\u2019s Twin Peaks: The Return. In addition to her small screen work, the Cleveland-born Porter had roles in films from The Truth About Cats & Dogs to Dude, Where\u2019s My Car? to The House.\n\n\u201cLinda wasn\u2019t just hilarious, she was incredibly sweet, energetic and enthusiastic \u2013 working with her brightened everyone\u2019s day,\u201d Superstore EPs and showrunners Gabe Miller and Jonathan Green said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have been a small part of her long career. The Superstore family won\u2019t be the same without her.\u201d Following word of her death, Porter\u2019s Superstore colleagues took to social media to remember her.\n\nThe Superstore team lost one of its best members. RIP Linda Porter. Always funny, always vibrant and ALWAYS enthusiastic. I don\u2019t know that anyone loved our show more than Linda. Both you and Myrtle will be deeply missed. xoxo pic.twitter.com/p0JyDH4gbA \u2014 Lauren Ash (@lauren_ash) September 28, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s hoping the angels don\u2019t call cut right away because your best stuff always came at the end. We\u2019ll miss you Linda Porter. pic.twitter.com/bcdkZtUnXq \u2014 Ben Feldman (@WhosBenFeldman) September 27, 2019", "description": "Actress Linda Porter, who played Myrtle on NBC\u2019s Superstore, has died at the age of 86, having also acted in Twin Peaks.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/28-Linda-Porter-Superstore.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
