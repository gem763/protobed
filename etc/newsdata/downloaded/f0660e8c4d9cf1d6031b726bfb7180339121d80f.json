Apparently, certain \u201cgel cover\u201d-style screen protectors can confuse the ultrasonic sensor, and if you register a fingerprint while the cover is applied, then the phone can start unlocking itself for anyone\u2019s fingerprint, not just those you\u2019ve registered.\n\nAfter initially issuing a statement saying that customers should only use \u201cSamsung authorized accessories\u201d with their device, Samsung now says it\u2019s going to fix the issue. The company told BBC News that it is \u201caware of the case of S10\u2019s malfunctioning fingerprint recognition and will soon issue a software patch.\u201d One Twitter user claimed that the Note 10, which uses a similar sensor, is also susceptible to the same issue.\n\nGlass screen protectors can also cause problems\n\nSince the S10 was announced, we\u2019ve known that it doesn\u2019t work well with certain kinds of screen protectors. In a video posted back in February, Marques Brownlee demonstrated how the phone will struggle to identify a previously registered fingerprint after you apply a thick glass screen protector. However, he didn\u2019t try registering a fingerprint after this screen protector was applied, which is what seems to have happened here. A regular plastic protector tested by Brownlee appeared to work just fine.\n\nSamsung\u2019s official support site admits that certain screen protectors can be a problem for the phone, noting that \u201cunofficial, scratched or dirty screen protectors may cause the fingerprint sensor to malfunction.\u201d The company has also said that some screen protectors that come with silicone phone cases can be recognized alongside fingerprints by the phone\u2019s sensor, according to a message in Samsung\u2019s support app, Reuters notes.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about the apparent security risks here, but you absolutely need to have a screen protector on your phone, then the simplest solution is to use the screen protector that comes pre-applied to the device. It might be a basic sheet of plastic that\u2019s unlikely to last you a lifetime, but you can always replace it when it inevitably gets scratched. When that happens, you probably don\u2019t need to go for Samsung\u2019s official $29.99 screen protector, but maybe you can buy something a little better than a \u00a32.70 gel cover from eBay.", "description": "A new report has claimed that the Samsung Galaxy S10\u2019s in-display fingerprint sensor has a security flaw.
