Here are some eye-catching odds for the Premier League match\n\nEverton the slight favourites\n\nEverton have endured a disappointing start to the season despite having invested many millions strengthening their squad over the summer.\n\nThe Toffees go into the game in 15th place in the table, just two points above the relegation zone, having lost five this season.\n\nThey managed to stop the rot and avoid a fifth consecutive defeat by beating West Ham 2-0 at home last weekend.\n\nEverton fans will be hoping that victory, for which manager Marco Silva made five changes to his team, marks a change in fortunes.\n\nHaving found a winning formula, albeit for one game, Paddy Power have an Everton win at 6/4.\n\nHowever, there are still major question marks over Silva and his future at Goodison Park.\n\nA loss could see the board crack under the pressure with Silva to be sacked at 5/2 on William Hill.\n\nTrossard to get his chance\n\nLeandro Trossard has had a difficult start to life in the Premier League with Brighton.\n\nThe Belgian, who cost the Seagulls \u00a315m in the summer, has played just three times and scored once.\n\nA groin injury has kept the winger out since August and a planned return against Aston Villa last weekend was postponed at the last minute.\n\nHowever, Aaron Mooy\u2019s suspension, due to his red card against Villa, gives Trossard the perfect chance to make a dream comeback.\n\nPaddy Power have Trossard to score anytime at 7/2.\n\nFired up Sigurdsson\n\nEverton favourite Gylfi Sigurdsson was one of the five changes Silva made against West Ham.\n\nThe Iceland international had a point to prove when he was brought on in the 87th minute and scored in injury time to seal three points for his team.\n\nSigurdsson\u2019s goal will give him confidence against Brighton and Paddy Power have him at 12/5 to score anytime.\n\nHistory is with Brighton\n\nIt may come as a suprise to some, but Brighton have never lost at home to Everton in the Premier League.\n\nThis will give Brighton some confidence going into the game, along with the added incentive that a win would mean they leapfrog Everton in the table.\n\nThe game also presents an opportunity for the Seagulls to win back-to-back Premier League home games for the first time in nearly a year.\n\nThe last time that happened, Brighton beat Wolves 1-0 courtesy of a Glenn Murray goal, and Paddy Power are offering Glenn Murray and 1-0 at 33/1.", "description": "Brighton and Everton will clash at the Amex Stadium with the teams separated by just one point.
