Hong/Associated Press\n\nMilwaukee Brewers star Christian Yelich's season is over at the worst possible time for the team's playoff hopes, as the Brewers announced the outfielder suffered a fractured kneecap during Tuesday's game against the Miami Marlins.\n\nPer Fox Sports Wisconsin's Sophia Minnaert, Yelich was replaced by Trent Grisham in the first inning when he fouled a ball off his knee.\n\nAn extended injury is the worst-case scenario for Milwaukee, especially with the team fighting for a playoff spot.\n\nYelich is once again in the National League MVP race with a .330/.430/.672 slash line, 44 homers and 97 RBI in 129 games.\n\nThe Brewers entered Tuesday's game with a 75-68 record, two games behind the Chicago Cubs for the second wild-card spot in the NL.\n\nWhile Yelich carries the Brewers offense when he is on the field, his injury now creates a significant hole.\n\nGrisham has appeared in only 32 games this season. He's looked solid with a .260/.324/.448 slash line, but there's no way for the 22-year-old to replace what Yelich offers.", "description": "Milwaukee Brewers  star  Christian Yelich 's season is over at the worst possible time for the team's playoff hopes, as the Brewers  announced  the outfielder suffered a fractured kneecap during Tuesday's game against the Miami Marlins...", "authors": ["Rob Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/807/115/hi-res-420534387b816fc4fd36fcdd5a37d74b_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
