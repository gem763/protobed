Firms will also not be allowed to stockpile dollars, Reuters reports.\n\nThe policy is now under intense scrutiny from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which can exert significant influence as it has a $57bn standby agreement with the government to prop up Argentina\u2019s struggling economy.\n\nREAD MORE: Argentina is in danger of not paying back its debts\n\nIt marks a political embarrassment for the president, who was elected on a pledge to sweep away the highly interventionist era under his left-wing predecessors, Nestor and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.\n\nBusinesses welcomed his election in December 2015 and he quickly set about liberalising the economy. He removed currency and export controls and returned the country to global financial markets, after settling a debt dispute dating back to its economic collapse in 2001.\n\nBut double-digit inflation and significant austerity cuts to services and subsidies in the years since have battered his popularity, with many Argentines taking to the streets.\n\nArgentinian president Mauricio Macri.
