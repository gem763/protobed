Actually, there\u2019s a third: the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G. It\u2019s exclusive to Verizon for now, though it will be coming to other carriers later.\n\nThey\u2019re all available for preorder through Samsung and US carriers. No matter where you purchase the phone, doing so before August 23rd (the release date) will get you a $100 Samsung gift card ($150 if you buy the Note 10 Plus or Note 10 Plus 5G).\n\nTo get the gift card, you\u2019ll have to register your preorder purchase through the Shop Samsung app on Android or iOS. First, sign in with your Samsung account, then tap the tab called \u201coffers\u201d in the app. Within it, click the \u201cpreorder & get more\u201d window, then tap \u201cSee if I\u2019m eligible\u201d and proceed with registering your phone there.\n\nIf you buy a Note 10 through Samsung, you\u2019ll be eligible to get up to $600 in trade-in credit toward a Note 10 or Note 10 Plus. Many carriers are offering their own respective trade-in offers, but Samsung\u2019s is the least thorny and restrictive.\n\nChoosing the right one for you is more than just comparing screen sizes; there are quite a few differences on the inside. Our first-look with the Note 10 series highlights all of those differences, and you\u2019ll want to stay tuned over the coming days for final thoughts in our full review.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 10\n\nThe Galaxy Note 10 starts at $949.99, and it\u2019s the cheaper of the two Note 10 phones. It has a 6.3-inch AMOLED screen, and it comes in just one configuration: 8GB RAM with 256GB of storage. Unlike the Galaxy Note 10 Plus, this model lacks a microSD tray for expandable storage and the ability to charge at 45W speeds. If missing out on those features isn\u2019t a bother to you, this one stands out as being easier to stick in your pocket.\n\nAll of the Note 10 variations are available in a few color options: aura glow, aura white, and aura black. Aura blue is exclusive to Best Buy in the US.\n\nUnlocked\n\nCarrier offers\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus\n\nThe Note 10 Plus starts at $1,099.99. This phone is the biggest, most feature-packed Note 10 option you can get. It has a 6.8-inch AMOLED screen and comes in several configurations, all with an impressive 12GB of RAM, as detailed below. The Note 10 Plus supports microSD cards and 45W fast charging, though it won\u2019t be able to do it with the charger that\u2019s included in the box.\n\nUnlocked\n\nCarrier offers\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G\n\nThe Note 10 Plus 5G will be available starting on August 23rd at Verizon. This phone supports LTE connectivity, and, as you likely guessed from the name, it supports Verizon\u2019s mmWave 5G network (as well as mid- and low-band frequencies). This phone will first be available for people who live in one of the cities where Verizon has launched its network and where it soon plans to launch. If you subscribe to any of the other major US carriers, like T-Mobile, AT&T, or Sprint, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to pick this phone up at a later date.\n\nCarrier offers\n\nVerizon is, for now, the only carrier that will sell the Note 10 Plus 5G. It\u2019s not available unlocked from a retail store, so if you want to get the base 256GB configuration of this phone on a 24-month payment plan, it will cost $54.16 per month or $1,299.99 all at once. The 512GB model will cost $58.33 per month on a 24-month payment plan or $1,399.99 for the full price.\n\nIf you want to pay less per month, Verizon is offering 36-month repayment plans for the Note 10 Plus 5G. It\u2019s $36.11 per month for 36 months if you want the 256GB version, or $38.88 for the 512GB 5G phone for 36 months.\n\nThe aforementioned Verizon promos listed in the smaller Note 10 section also apply here, except Note 10 Plus 5G buyers will instead get a $150 Samsung gift card.", "description": "The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 phones have been unveiled, and you can place a preorder through several retailers and carriers.
