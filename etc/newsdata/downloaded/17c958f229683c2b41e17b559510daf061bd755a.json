But let's be clear - all events are not equal and all events are not welcome.\"\n\nFormula One chiefs said earlier this month the planned race in Miami, targeted for 2021, would generate more than $400 million in revenue.", "description": "Proposals to bring F1 racing to Miami hit a speed bump after local officials voted in favour of two measures which potentially complicate plans to stage a race in the Florida city.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9294/c4839271fb4b43028dc54ecebd4c5057.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
