There\u2019s competition for that there madness.\n\nOut of the mouths of Democrats: There are the giveaways \u2014 the free college, free health care, free prescription medicines, free money for minorities.\n\nThere are the Russia collusion impeachment charges, Russia conspiracy impeachment charges, Russia obstruction of justice impeachment charges, Russia conflicts of impeachment charges \u2014 all of which died under investigation.\n\nThere are the antifa types taking to streets to beat up MAGA hat wearers; the Democratic leaders standing quietly by and watching their little resistance movement minions take to the streets; the socialists of the party openly calling for socialism in America; the climate change clangers and gun confiscation zealots marching, marching, marching ever toward more destruction of American freedoms.\n\nQuite a tea party, wouldn\u2019t you say?\n\nBut Beto \u2014 but Beto O\u2019Rourke, the guy who gazes at the looking glass and gets a reflection of Robert Francis looking back \u2014 has truly outdone them all.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, on national TV, just said, in essence, the Bible\u2019s got to go, God\u2019s Word is meaningless and churches need to toe the LGBTQ line and quit all that stuff and nonsense about preaching sin.\n\nQuite a mouthful. Here are the pertinent interview portions.\n\n\u201cFreedom of religion is a fundamental right, but it should not be used to discriminate,\u201d CNN host Don Lemon said, before teeing up this question to O\u2019Rourke: \u201cDo you think religious institutions like colleges, churches, charities \u2014 should they lose their tax exempt status is they oppose same-sex marriage?\u201d\n\nAnd O\u2019Rourke goes \u2014 yep.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\nYes, he said, then added: \u201cThere can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every one of us. And so as president \u2026 we are going to stop those who are infringing upon human rights.\u201d\n\nHis argument rests on the idea that LGBTQs are born that way and should therefore be afforded the same political protections as, say, minorities with no control over their skin colors. But on LGBTQ issues, and on homosexuality in particular, the Bible teaches otherwise. The Bible teaches choice. So, too, by the way, do other religions\u2019 sacred texts.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s predicating his view on a falsity. And rather than adjusting his view, he\u2019s trying to adjust the views of the truth-tellers. Or else.\n\nJust as egregiously, he\u2019s tossing a whole constitutional construct of this country out the window.\n\nIn America, the right to worship freely is God-given. The right to worship freely is First Amendment-guaranteed. The right to worship freely is a core principle of the country\u2019s founding.\n\nIt\u2019s in essence why we\u2019re here.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s not-so-veiled threat to the churches reveals either his ignorance of that history, or his utter scorn of that history \u2014 neither of which make him a good presidential candidate.\n\nThere\u2019s actually a case that could be made for churches to lose their Internal Revenue Service tax exemptions based on the fact that too much concern for government dollars can lead to a watering of The Word, and a soft secularizing of the church. But O\u2019Rourke doesn\u2019t make that argument.\n\nHis is more of a figurative gun pointed at the churches and an accompanying demand to \u201cstep away from the Bible.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not just un-American.\n\nIt\u2019s practically blasphemous.\n\nIt\u2019s O\u2019Rourke setting himself higher than the teachings of God.\n\nAnd if this is where Democrats are taking the party, it\u2019s like the Wonderland portrayed by author Lewis Carroll \u2014 the scenarios are just growing curiouser and curiouser.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
