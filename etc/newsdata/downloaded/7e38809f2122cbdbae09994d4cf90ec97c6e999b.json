Twitter/@lovemakingjokes\n\nIn every match, there will be a winner and a loser, but it seems not everyone can accept being the latter.\n\nCase in point: Thursday night\u2019s World Cup qualifier between Indonesia and Malaysia in Jakarta, which saw the home side losing 3-2 to the guests.\n\nOne Twitter user, who posted a video of Indonesian supporters banging on the walls and doors of a compound holding Malaysian fans, likened the scene to one from South Korean zombie film \u201cTrain to Busan\u201d.\n\nTrain To Busan deleted scene : It proves that an Indognesial zombie is the stupidest zombie ever exist. #HarimauMalaya #WorldCupqualifiers pic.twitter.com/TGFcf8NmBF \u2014 \u20b5\u0158\u00d8\u20a9 (@lovemakingjokes) September 5, 2019\n\nSome of the most iconic scenes in the highly-acclaimed horror movie involve the undead banging on similar walls and doors to get to their trapped victims.\n\nA Twitter user compared the Indonesian supporters to zombies in \u201cTrain to Busan\u201d.

According to The Guardian, the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) had requested in advance for an armoured personnel carrier to be on standby.\n\nThe same report also said that Indonesia is one of the most dangerous countries in the world to watch football, with around 70 people killed at or around football games since the early 1990s.\n\nAccording to The Star, at least one Malaysian was injured during the chaos that unfolded on Thursday.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s very own sports minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman was among the many Malaysians at the stadium.\n\nThe Star quoted him as saying that several Indonesian fans tried to ram the Malaysian area after the match. As a safety measure, Malaysian fans had to wait in an area in the stadium for things to calm down before they could leave, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is sad, considering that the football industry was supposed to be a medium of unity. I promise I will demand justice for Malaysians,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\nIn light of the incident, FAM will be filing a formal complaint to FIFA, the minister said, adding that he would also lodge a complaint with the Indonesian government.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - This scene look familiar to you?.
