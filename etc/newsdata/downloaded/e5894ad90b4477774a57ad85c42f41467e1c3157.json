Elizabeth Warren made that clear when she threw the first punch at Big Tech Tuesday night, and she was joined by just about every other Democrat onstage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and democracy,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to fight back.\u201d\n\nThe attacks showed growing mistrust of Silicon Valley\u2019s command over information and economic power that would have been unthinkable before Facebook emerged as a key tool of foreign influence in the 2016 election. But even if Tuesday night\u2019s debate showed Democrats in lockstep in their criticism of Big Tech, they differ wildly on how to respond \u2014 and even what problems they\u2019re trying to solve.\n\nWarren has been trumpeting her plan to break up huge tech platforms in recent months and promised to return any donation over $200 from Silicon Valley executives. On Tuesday, she singled out Amazon for using its vast trove of consumer data to boost its own products at the expense of competitors.\n\n\u201cLook, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game, or you get to have a team,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you don't get to do both at the same time.\u201d\n\nREAD: Last night's debate proved Elizabeth Warren is the Democratic front-runner\n\nThe entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who has built a dedicated online following, allowed that there are \u201cexcesses in technology\u201d and warned of how screen time will affect children. But he disagreed with Warren\u2019s breakup plan. Instead, he said, the federal government should essentially tax Big Tech for its use of our personal data.\n\n\u201cWhat we have to do is we have to hone in on the specific problems we're trying to solve and use 21st century solutions for 21st century problems,\u201d he said. \u201cUsing a 20th century antitrust framework will not work.\u201d\n\nThat existing framework revolves around whether companies use their size to jack up prices or otherwise harm consumers. Sen. Bernie Sanders alluded to that standard Tuesday in railing against a \u201crigged economy\u201d controlled by a small group of elites.\n\n\u201cWe need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies, protect small business, and protect consumers by ending the price fixing that we see every day,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD: No More Mr. Nice Mayor Pete\n\nBut companies like Facebook and Google offer free services. That\u2019s left the American public split on new regulations for Big Tech, according to public opinion polls, though support for tougher rules appears to be growing.\n\nStill, Democrats like Sen. Amy Klobuchar tread lightly on the topic Tuesday night, framing potential regulation as a \u201cpro-competition issue.\u201d Without naming names, she implied that consolidation in the tech industry could stifle entrepreneurship. Federal regulators, states\u2019 attorneys general, and House Democrats are currently exploring that question in a web of overlapping investigations.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a startup slump in this country,\u201d Klobuchar warned.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke likewise called for an update in antitrust enforcement \u2014 without mentioning specifics. Former Vice President Joe Biden, whose campaign has laced into Facebook after it allowed Trump to buy false ads about his son\u2019s business dealings abroad, did not get a chance to respond.\n\nREAD: Elizabeth Warren Won't Say the Word \u2018Taxes\u2019 When She Talks About Medicare for All\n\nThe most bizarre detour came from Sen. Kamala Harris, who pivoted from the question about tech policy into an argument for suspending President Donald Trump from Twitter. Criticizing the company for applying its rules unequally to different users, she repeatedly asked Warren to join her in calling for Trump to get the boot.\n\n\u201cLook, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter,\u201d Warren replied. \u201cI want to push him out of the White House.\u201d\n\nCover: Democratic presidential hopeful Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (L) talks to entrepreneur Andrew Yang during a break in the fourth Democratic primary debate of the 2020 presidential campaign season co-hosted by The New York Times and CNN at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio on October 15, 2019.
