It\u2019s do-or-die footy. We knew the reality was we could have been going home if we didn\u2019t bring it tonight.\u201d\n\nIreland coach Joe Schmidt, who is stepping down from the role, conceded that the team had been \u201ca little bit flat all season\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just disappointing. We were great last year, we\u2019ve just come off the top of that and haven\u2019t been quite where we wanted to be.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks had a front-loaded Pool B, winning their crucial opening match against South Africa to enable coach Steve Hansen to rotate his squad for games against Canada and Namibia.\n\nTheir final pool match against Italy was cancelled because of the deady Typhoon Hagibis that swept through eastern Japan, meaning their last proper match \u2014 an academic victory over the Namibians \u2014 was a full 13 days ago.\n\nBut there was no ring-rustiness on show at Tokyo Stadium as a powerful, offloading All Blacks side handed out a masterclass in game management, allying superb ball-retention with a ferocious, smothering defence for which the Irish had no answer.\n\nMo\u2019unga opened the scoring with a sixth-minute penalty after Jacob Stockdale was penalised for a deliberate knock-on.\n\nNew Zealand worked the close quarters around the ruck early on, and there were only so many waves of attack Ireland could withstand before wilting, Smith darting over from short range.\n\n\u2013 Ireland outclassed \u2013\n\nSexton spurned a shot at goal to go for the corner, but Mo\u2019unga produced an athletic leap to keep the ball in play, eventually finding the ubiquitous Barrett inside him for the clearance.\n\nSmith got his second shortly afterwards following an initial slick midfield move that saw the impressive Sevu Reece loop around and find fellow winger George Bridge, whose mazy run saw him squirm his way up to the line.\n\nThe All Black scrum-half was on hand to muscle his way over despite the attentions of Stockdale and Conor Murray. Two Mo\u2019unga conversions and suddenly New Zealand were 17-0 up.\n\nThe All Blacks\u2019 defensive wall did its work when Reece hit the heavily marked Jonny Sexton, dislodging the ball for Mo\u2019unga to kick ahead, with Barrett on hand to collect his own additional dribble and cross for a third try.\n\nIreland hadn\u2019t helped themselves in the first-half, guilty of falling off tackles, handling errors and poor kicking.\n\nThe second period started no better for them, outclassed by New Zealand\u2019s sublime off-loading skills.\n\nWhen Kieran Read took a flat ball off Smith, he turned hitting the floor and popped to Codie Taylor, the hooker flopping over under the posts for a try, Mo\u2019unga adding the extras.\n\nReplacement flanker Matt Todd was next on the scoresheet, shooting over from short range after Reece had taken a cross-field kick from Barrett and got to within a yard of the line.\n\nIreland briefly stirred, with Joey Carbery on for Sexton, centre Robbie Henshaw crossing for a try and referee Nigel Owens awarding a penalty try after Todd infringed.\n\nBut New Zealand underlined their credentials as World Cup contenders with a wonderful sixth try, Bridge finishing off a move that saw Dane Coles produce a fantastic one-handed off-load that summed up the All Blacks\u2019 superior attacking intent.\n\nJordie Barrett went over for a final try at the whistle as New Zealand now turn their attentions to England.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Aaron Smith scored a brace of tries as defending champions New Zealand thrashed Ireland 46-14 on Saturday to set up a mouth-watering", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/06df0b_new-zealand-scrum-aaron-smith-scored-two-in-up-all-blacks-thrash-ireland-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
