Since the retirement of Bhaichung Bhutia, he has pretty much picked up the mantle.\n\nAFP\n\nThe man recently became the only Indian footballer to have 1 million followers on Instagram, and there is no doubt he's earned it. With 72 goals in 113 appearances since his debut in 2005, the 35-year-old is the only Indian in the top ten of most goals scored at international level.\n\nYes, his 72nd goal ensured he secured 10th place and that is a big deal, giving us a reason to be proud. The top spot is occupied by Ali Daei of Iran with 109, the only one with over 100. Cristiano Ronaldo is 2nd with 95 and highest among active players. Meanwhile guess where Lionel Messi is? Way below at 20th place with 68.\n\nDon't Miss 4.1 K SHARES 181 SHARES 645 SHARES\n\nChhetri still has a good 2-3 years left in him. There is a chance he could finish in the top 5 by the time he is done. In fact after Ronaldo, he has the most goals among active players which is a big deal.\n\nFor a country crazy over cricket, Chhetri's accomplishments can make us take notice that there is a lot to celebrate in Indian football. While we may not be among the top 100 in the FIFA rankings, we do have one of the top goal-scorers and that is something we can say with pride.
