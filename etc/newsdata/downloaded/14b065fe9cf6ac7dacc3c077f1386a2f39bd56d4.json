He didn\u2019t think it was going to blow up like it did,' freshman Kirsten Busby said to Localmemphis.com on the student's blackface photo.\n\nA male University of Mississippi student reported himself to school officials last week for posing in black face in a photo he shared on social media. In response school officials sent out this e-mail entitled 'My Culture is Not a Costume' to warn against racist and offensive costumes\n\n'It wasn\u2019t that shocking because things like this have happened on campus before,' student Jaylon Lester said. 'But I wouldn\u2019t let that reflect on the university because we\u2019ve come so far.'\n\n'I feel like he just needs to have more insight like thought and training on understanding on why it is offensive to people of color,' he added.\n\n'In my eyes I see it as very surprising because I personally hold this school to a higher standard than others. I don\u2019t think it should be here, I thought this was all past us but I guess it's not,' freshman Brendan Murphy said to Fox13.\n\nAccording to the e-mail the student is now working on a 'Restorative Justice Plan' - which allows students who have negatively impacted certain groups to engage with those groups and learn from the experience - and school officials believe 'the student is remorseful and eager to engage with appropriate groups on campus.'\n\n'Although we deplore the racist post, we thank the student for coming forward and for his willingness to educate himself and to dialogue with those directly impacted,' the e-mail said.\n\nThe student 'self-reported his post and acknowledged the racist and hurtful impact of his poor judgement', the college said in a school e-mail. The University of Mississippi campus pictured above\n\nAnother e-mail entitled 'My Culture Is Not A Costume' was sent out to students last week by Katrina Caldwell, the vice chancellor for Diversity & Community Engagement, and Noel Wilkin, the provost and executive vice chancellor for Academic Affairs, to warn against wearing culturally and racially offensive Halloween costumes.\n\n'As we enter the season of costume parties, please avoid culturally inappropriate behavior. A recent post reinforces why this is important,' citing that blackface photo.\n\n'As the season of fall parties and Halloween celebrations approaches, a disturbing trend on college campuses involves students and campus organizations engaging in culturally inappropriate behavior.\n\n'Some examples include the use of blackface, costumes that mock or demean other people\u2019s culture, and identity-based slurs. While most of these cases involve examples of protected speech and expressions, we want our community to understand that these practices are both insensitive and rooted in a history of hate that causes real harm to individuals and our community,' the letter continued.\n\nThe statement included tips and questions students should consider in choosing Halloween outfits such as: 'Is my costume intended to be funny?', 'Is it funny because it is making fun of real people, human traits, or cultures?', 'Does my costume perpetuate stereotypes, misinformation, or historical and cultural inaccuracies?'\n\nThis isn't the first time Ole Miss has made headlines for controversial posts.\n\nIn July three students landed in hot water when they shared photos posing with guns in front of an Emmit Till sign.", "description": "A male University of Mississippi student reported himself to school officials last week for posing in black face in a photo he shared on social media.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/14/19693826-0-image-a-6_1571060982667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
