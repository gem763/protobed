How many heat settings do you want? Do you need dual controls? Would you like a blanket that responds to your body temperature? And how important is it to be able to bung it in the washing machine and tumble dryer?\n\nWe\u2019ve had some seriously toasty nights testing the best of them, taking into consideration everything from how quickly they heat up to whether they live up to the features they promise. We also took into consideration how comfy they were, how easy they were to attach to the bed and how well they washed.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The elasticated skirt is extra-deep, so fitting it over the mattress is quick and easy, and it\u2019s sumptuously thick yet breathable, so it keeps you as cool in summer as it does warm in winter, responding to your temperature while you sleep and helping to protect your mattress. It comes with dual controls and a \"ready for bed\" pre-heat button to warm it up in five minutes. It\u2019s machine washable and tumble dryer safe. Available in single up to super king.\n\nBuy now\n\nSlumberdown perfectly warm luxury electric blanket: From \u00a349.99, Argos\n\nThe extra fleece layer on this machine-washable and tumble dry-able blanket is a stand out point. Despite the extra thickness, the corner straps secure it to the mattress without it pinging off every time you go to change the sheets (a common bugbear) and we also like the fact that you can heat up either your whole body or just your feet. The sensor responds to the room temperature and you can keep it on all night, although there\u2019s shut off if you prefer. Plus, there\u2019s a whopping nine settings. But it takes 15 minutes to heat up \u2013 longer than others \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t seem to get quite as hot.\n\nBuy now\n\nRelaxwell luxury heated throw: \u00a349.99, John Lewis & Partners\n\nThis microfleece throw comes in black, grey and teal, and can double up in the lounge and the bedroom. It\u2019s soft, lightweight and surprisingly large at 120cm by 160cm. It has six settings, and responds to changes in temperature, making sure you don't get too hot and reducing energy consumption. It costs from 1p per use and reaches the required temperature in just five minutes. It's machine washable at 40C. You can also tumble dry it on a low setting.\n\nBuy now\n\nDreamland intelliheat Sherpa over blanket: \u00a379.99, Dreamland\n\nThis is a great investment if you prefer your heat source to be over, rather than under you \u2013 handy if you get too hot as you can just toss it aside, although that\u2019s unlikely to happen due to the intelligent heating system which responds to your body temperature. You can keep it on top of your bed or slot it inside your duvet cover, making it versatile, and both sides of the blanket are soft to the touch \u2013 one is velvet, the other Sherpa, so called due to its likeness to the wool-lined clothing worn by the Sherpa people of Nepal. The neutral colour means it suits most d\u00e9cor.\n\nBuy now\n\nBeurer allergy free heated mattress cover: From \u00a358.63, Amazon\n\nThis is our top recommendation for those with allergies, asthma or sensitive skin as it has a heat setting that protects against house dust mites (and their eggs), bacteria and mould. The cotton is breathable, making this particularly good for using all year round. It's comfortable to sleep on, too \u2013 although it's not as deep quilted as some. It stays securely on the bed, thanks to the deep elasticated skirt. It warms up in eight minutes, has six temperature sets and turns off automatically after one, three, six or even 12 hours. Available in single up to super king.\n\nBuy now\n\nLakeland velvety electric heated throw: \u00a379.99, Lakeland\n\nAnother electric blanket that you can drape over you, this one works just as well for sitting in front of the telly as it does on a bed. It\u2019s available in a soft grey, although we prefer this rustic, country-house style of grey and red check. The stroke-able soft fleece is dreamsville for when you\u2019re feeling tired and in need of cosiness and the controls allow you to tailor it precisely to your level of coldness, using the six heat settings which include a \u201cready for bed\u201d fast preheat setting that means it\u2019s pleasantly hot within five minutes. The auto shut-off can be set to either one or nine hours.\n\nBuy now\n\nLloytron superior under blanket: From \u00a326.99, Amazon\n\nThis is one of the cheapest electric blankets in our round-up. It heats up in 15 minutes, has three settings and there are dual controls for the double version. The thin wires mean you that can't feel them when you lie down (a common flaw of other cheaper blankets). It doesn't get as hot as some blankets, the ties can be a bit fiddly and it's not machine washable, but it's great value for money. Available from single to king.\n\nBuy now\n\nRelaxwell leopard print faux fur heated throw: \u00a3119.99, Lakeland\n\nAesthetically, this has the ultimate wow factor thanks to the leopard print which is great to cuddle up with. It warms up in five minutes, has six heat settings and turns off automatically. It's machine washable and can go in the tumble dryer, so you can keep it clean with ease and the storage bag means you can put it away in the summer months without it collecting dust. One for the top of a bed or wrapping yourself in on the sofa, it will do either (or both) your sitting room or bedroom proud.\n\nBuy now\n\nLakeland luxury fleece fitted electric blanket: From \u00a359.99, Lakeland\n\nThis is a great all-rounder. It takes five minutes to heat up, has six heat settings, offers graduated foot warmth, has dual controls and feels well made. You might even find that you only need to warm the bed up, then turn it off when you get in, as the fleecy cover retains heat really well. There are no annoying tapes as it fits over the whole mattress (including over a mattress topper, if needs be). We imagine it would last many years. Available in single to king.\n\nBuy now\n\nDreamland intelliheat harmony dual control heated over blanket: From \u00a359.99, Dreamland\n\nYou can drape this satin-trimmed blanket over your bed or slot it inside your duvet cover. It responds to your body temperature, so there\u2019s no need to worry about getting too hot, and works well if you have memory-foam mattresses that already do the job of keeping you warm underneath. This one is thicker than previous versions and has dual controls and if you have an unusually sized bed, it\u2019s ideal because it can simply drape over. Available from single to king.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Electric blankets\n\nThe Dreamland boutique hotel mattress protector ticked all our boxes, and some. It's comfy, warm, quick, intuitive and versatile. But for a fabulous over blanket, we love Lakeland's leopard print faux fur heated throw.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
