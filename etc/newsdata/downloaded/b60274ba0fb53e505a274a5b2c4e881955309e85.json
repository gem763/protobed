The new autofocus sensor is expected to offer 28 times more resolution at its center than its predecessor. It will also have 525 autofocus zones with the new double-pixel AF CMOS system covering 90% of the sensor's range.\n\nCanon has also announced that its EOS-1D X Mark III has faster frame rates (up to 16 fps with autofocus and automatic exposure with the Optical viewfinder) and 20 images a second in Live View (when the camera's image is shown on its screen), meaning better images of subjects in rapid movement, such as cars during a race or birds in flight.\n\nCanon states that the EOS-1D X Mark III will be able to shoot 4K video including 4K60p.\n\nThe camera will of course be Bluetooth- and wifi-compatible, but the speed of its ethernet connectivity will be doubled so that file transfer will be twice as fast, even while handling much denser images.\n\nNext year looks set to be a big one for serious photographers, as the Nikon D6 expected to be released as well.", "description": "Canon has announced the 2020 launch of its next-generation EOS-1D X Mark III professional reflex camera and released some impressive technical details.
