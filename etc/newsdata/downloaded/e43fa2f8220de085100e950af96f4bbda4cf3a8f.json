Owner- occupiers have long exhibited a preference for properties geographically close to their current address. Lower search costs, restrictions on mobility due to employment and social networks and familiarity help explain this phenomenon for owner-occupiers.\n\nThe average property investor holds only one investment property alongside their place of residence.\n\nBut the academics noted that investors who have the most to gain through geographic diversification did not do so.\n\nThe research came as residential real estate investment in Australia is a growing segment of the housing market with concerns of increased risks to financial stability.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) estimates that investors account for around 26 per cent of residential real estate holdings.\n\n\u201cOur research presents timely information that may be used by regulators and lenders to better manage these risks,\u201d the report noted.\n\nThe academics argued that putting all the eggs in one basket was riskier for the individual investor and also the economy. Higher geographical concentration of property investments increase the risk of negative equity foreclosures in any market downturn, amplifying economic cycles.\n\nUsing a mortgage application database, the report found that non-local property purchases accounted for less than one-third of all investor purchases.\n\nThe data in the study was sourced from a major bank comprising 1.1 million residential mortgage applications from owner-occupiers and property investors from 2003 to 2009, which was a time when investors had the capability of claiming travel costs in their tax returns. The entitlement was taken away in Scott Morrison\u2019s 2017 budget.\n\nThe research noted the home bias did not necessarily arise from any desire to self-manage the rental of the property, although it pointed out the Real Estate Institute of Australia calculated around one in five property investors self-manage their properties.\n\nNor did the research results show that the preference for local property was explained by local investors getting a \u2018\u2018good deal\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u201cOn average, local investors tend to pay more than non-local investors,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThey\u2019re potentially overconfident in their local area, the report authors suggested.\n\n\u201cWe find that \u2018sophisticated\u2019 investors are more likely to invest outside of the suburb in which they live than less sophisticated investors,\u201d the report said.", "description": "Around two-thirds of Australians who bought an investment property purchased close to where they live, but this might not be the smartest play.", "authors": ["Jonathan Chancellor"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/25121331/capi_2755ed31722085dc68f641804e1546d0_cce33fa655724f4d7ad3bb336cdc3a6a.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
