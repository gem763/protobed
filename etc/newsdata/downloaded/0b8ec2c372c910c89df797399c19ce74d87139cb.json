But are leaders really listening?", "language": "en", "text": "New York (CNN) When Greta Thunberg began her speech to the United Nations, it was clear from the start that her address to world leaders would be different.\n\n\"My message is that we'll be watching you.\"\n\nThe line was met by applause and some laughs, but her expression signaled that this was no laughing matter to her.\n\nIf you listen to the scientists, as Thunberg urged Congress to do earlier this month , it's easy to understand why.\n\nIf the planet continues to warm, the evidence suggests the future awaiting her generation could be frightening\n\nThe 16-year-old's fiery speech was a milestone of sorts for a movement that's been given new urgency by a group of savvy young leaders.\n\nAround the world, young people are increasingly leading the push to address climate change. They are filing lawsuits , marching in the streets in massive numbers, and pressuring world leaders to act.\n\nBut based on the wan commitments to reduce planet-warming emissions that were announced at the UN Climate Summit this week \u2014 and the absence of major polluters like the US from the stage entirely \u2014 key world leaders still aren't willing to take the transformative action scientists say we need to rid the global economy of its fossil fuel dependence.\n\nThe science is clear that we need to act now. And to do so, the adults in power will have to listen to the kids.\n\nAnatomy of a growing movement\n\nThe global climate strikes that brought millions out last Friday weren't just notable for their size.\n\nThe crowds are more diverse, more female and younger than they've ever been before, said Dana R. Fisher , a University of Maryland sociology professor who has studied and surveyed the climate movement for years.\n\nAt the march in Washington, Fisher and her research team surveyed nearly 200 of those in attendance. They found that 58 percent of the strike participants identified as female, compared to 50.8 percent of the US population that identified as female in the 2010 census\n\nFisher surveyed more than 100 organizers of marches around the country and found even more females in charge, with 68 percent of respondents identifying as female.\n\nStudents and activists march to the US Capitol during the Global Climate Strike in Washington, DC on September 20, 2019.\n\nThose participating in the DC march were young, with 25 percent under the age of 18, according to Fisher's polling.\n\n\"Since I've been studying the people who participate in these protests, I can tell you that the people who are in the streets are much, much younger than they were before,\" Fisher said.\n\nAlexandria Villase\u00f1or, a 14-year-old activist who has been striking outside the United Nations every Friday for nearly a year, says that her peers need adult allies, but that they have infused the movement with youthful ambition at a critical time.\n\n\"When the youth are leading, we think outside of the box and outside of the system that's been created,\" said Villase\u00f1or. \"We think about what really needs to happen to combat the climate crisis, we don't think about what's politically possible.\"\n\nLittle action from the biggest emitters\n\nThat was the message from a dire report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that detailed what needs to be done to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\nBut that report was delivered nearly a year ago.\n\nDespite the urgency conveyed by scientists and expressed by the growing youth movement, some world leaders don't appear to be heeding their calls.\n\nThis week, aiming to spur governments and businesses, the United Nations began its General Assembly with a day-long Climate Action Summit.\n\n\"From the beginning, I said the ticket to entry is not a beautiful speech, but concrete action,\" said UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres as he opened the summit.\n\nPresident Trump and Vice President Mike Pence made a brief appearance during the UN Climate Action Summit, but the US did not announce any plans to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nBut the countries that could put the biggest dent in global emissions were largely absent.\n\nChina, which currently emits more greenhouse gases than any other country , announced it had achieved its emissions reductions goals ahead of schedule, but made no new commitments.\n\nWhile there were some significant commitments made by smaller countries, businesses and financial institutions, experts say what was announced is not nearly enough.\n\nThe countries that have agreed to enhance their climate goals by 2020 represent just 8 percent of global emissions , said Helen Mountford, vice president of climate and economics at the World Resources Institute.\n\n\"It just reflects an incredible disconnect between the politicians who are lagging behind what we're seeing from the youth on the streets, and with what businesses and investors are doing,\" Mountford said.\n\nAll eyes on 2020\n\nOne week after millions of people poured onto streets around the globe, a small crowd gathered outside of New York's city hall Friday, after Greta Thunberg and other youth leaders again called for more strikes.\n\nIn a crowd that skewed very young, many said they had seen the devastating storms and felt the higher temperatures. They said it was deep concern that compelled them to skip school and speak out.\n\nThe global strikes on September 20th were the biggest yet, with millions joining marches around the world.\n\n\"We see the studies and we know how scary the situation actually is, and we're acting out of fear,\" said Gabby Campos, a 17-year-old high school student.\n\nOthers like Marco Volpitta, a 17-yard-old who said he has been striking every Friday for a month, said he was frightened by future climate projections, but also felt it was his duty to get involved.\n\n\"We have not just a moral duty to strike, but we have a survivalist imperative to do it,\" he said.\n\nVolpitta and Campos will both be old enough to vote by next November, and they plan to make themselves heard through more traditional means at the polls in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn the meantime, their message to leaders echoes Thunberg's: From the halls of Congress to the floor of the UN General Assembly, they say they will be watching.", "description": "Young people are increasingly leading the push to address climate change.
