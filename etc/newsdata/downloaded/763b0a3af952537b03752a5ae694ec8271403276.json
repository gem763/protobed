The top post on r/AskReddit recently asked, \u201cWhat is something we can all agree on being a \u2018dick move\u2019?\u201d The top answers, agreed upon by thousands of Reddit users, shared a theme: The most universal dick move is being selfish in a crowd. Especially being selfish in a crowd that\u2019s all trying to get somewhere.\n\nFor example:\n\nCutting in line\n\nCrowding the door out of the plane\n\nTaking multiple seats when you fit fine in one\n\nGetting on the train before others can get off\n\nCutting people off in traffic\n\nLittering\n\nTailgating\n\nPlaying sound or music out loud in public\n\nStealing a parking space\n\nParking and blocking traffic\n\nRedditors agreed that they hate this crap. They love when they see someone call it out. They like to get petty revenge. If you do this crap, you could get yourself in trouble with a lot of strangers.\n\nThe thing is, everyone has done one of these things, even if by accident. That doesn\u2019t make you a bad person (there are plenty of other things that make you a bad person). But it means two things:\n\nFirst, think carefully before doing something that might be seen as a dick move. Slow down a tiny bit. Partly to be nice, and partly to avoid giving a bunch of strangers a reason to root against you, embarrass you or pick a fight with you.\n\nSecond, when you have a good reason to do a dick thing, explain it ever so briefly, and apologise. Really err on the side of apology. Because when everyone\u2019s just trying to make it somewhere on time, everyone\u2019s agitated and on edge. And by acting nice \u2014 nicer than you feel \u2014 you can disarm them all.\n\nI lied, there\u2019s three things. Third: Most of the time, your good reason isn\u2019t enough. If your \u201cgood reason\u201d applies to a lot of people around you, and they aren\u2019t making the same selfish move, then suck it up. \u201cI\u2019m late\u201d is usually not a good reason, because you are never the only one who\u2019s late.\n\nSelfishness is the refusal to recognise that other people are wholly and fully people, and that you are only and merely people too. And that is a failure of imagination shared by sociopaths and toddlers.\n\nSo next time you\u2019re in a crowd, especially a crowd on the move, don\u2019t act as though you\u2019re the special one. Don\u2019t act as though you\u2019re the most important. The odds are against you.\n\nDamn, OK, that was pretty harsh. Let\u2019s all listen to a good song about being a douchebag, written by someone who truly knows.", "description": "Reddit must know it\u2019s Jerk Week.
