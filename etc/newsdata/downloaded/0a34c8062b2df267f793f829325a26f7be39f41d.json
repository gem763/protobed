The petitioners feared the U.K. government may try to get around the act, for instance, by sending another letter to Brussels effectively cancelling the first one, or by persuading another EU member state to veto the U.K.\u2019s request for an extension.\n\nJudge Lord Pentland dismissed the case. Referring to government documents submitted to the court, which show Johnson accepts he must send a letter to the EU requesting an extension, he said in his ruling: \u201cHaving regard to the Prime Minister's and the Government\u2019s unequivocal assurances before the court ... that they will comply with the 2019 Act, I am not persuaded that it is necessary for the court to grant the orders sought or any variant of them.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI am not satisfied that the petitioners have made out their case based on reasonable apprehension of breach of statutory duty on the part of the Prime Minister.\u201d\n\nThe petitioners said they plan to appeal his decision, with their appeal expected to be heard Tuesday.\n\nCommenting on the ruling, Maugham tweeted: \u201cThe question whether this loss matters depends on whether you think I am right or the Court is right. But, on any view, there are now risks of an unlawful Brexit that would not, had the decision gone the other way, have existed.\u201d\n\nIn a court hearing Friday, Andrew Webster, the lawyer representing the government, argued that imposing any orders on the prime minister could \u201cruin\u201d the U.K.\u2019s negotiating strategy with the EU.\n\nAsked about the Scottish court case shortly before the ruling was announced, Johnson said: \u201cWe will study any judgments, of course, very closely, as we always do. We will respect the law. And we will leave the European Union on October 31. Clearly that\u2019s what the people of this country voted for. I think most people just want to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nA panel of judges of the Court of Session\u2019s Inner House will hold a hearing Tuesday on another part of the case: whether the court can use its \u201cnobile officium\u201d power to, in effect, sign a letter to EU leaders requesting an extension to negotiations on behalf of the prime minister.\n\nCORRECTION: This article has been updated to correct the name of the businessman who brought the case to court.", "description": "Campaigners say they will appeal the decision.", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178137456-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
