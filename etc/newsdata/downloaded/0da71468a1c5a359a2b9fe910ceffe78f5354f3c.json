Or visiting your mafioso father in jail with a blonde wig. Or, yikes, whacking a preppy kid unconscious in a dorm room with a stapler? Why don\u2019t these kids just leave! (Oh right, one does.) But, most poignantly, we get to see how the unexpected passing of Fred Andrews (Perry) will influence our characters at a crucial time in their lives. \u201cIt hurts me that I never got to say goodbye,\u201d his son, Archie (K.J.
