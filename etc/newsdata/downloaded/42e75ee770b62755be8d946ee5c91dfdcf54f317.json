This year it is off 11% as ties strained again over Syria and Turkey's purchase of Russian missiles.\n\nTurkish state banks have stepped in to support the currency, selling dollars since the Syria incursion began last week. Three bankers said the lenders also continued to squeeze an offshore FX swap market on Thursday, continuing an operation that began earlier this week. [\n\n\"The tendency of Turkish banks to provide lira to the swap market is nearly down to zero, except the pre-determined responsibilities and outstanding amounts,\" said a senior banker who declined to be named.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. prosecutors charged Turkish state-owned lender Halkbank with taking part in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nWhile the bank said the indictment amounted to yet more sanctions, Ankara avoided making the explicit connection until Thursday when Turkey's Justice Minister reportedly said it was \"an issue of political blackmail.\"\n\n\"We can say clearly that, based on the circumstances and the timing, it absolutely has no legal basis,\" Abdulhamit Gul said according to state-owned Anadolu.\n\nThe state bank interventions echoed actions taken in March, when a swap-market squeeze briefly sent the cost of overnight lira borrowing soaring past 1,000%. It stood at 16.6% at 0730 GMT, from a close of 17.3% on Wednesday.\n\nState banks also stepped in to sell dollars in March when the lira briefly tumbled, and traders have said they intervened again in the last two weeks, spending billions of dollars.\n\nTurkey's incursion into northeast Syria could imperil its economy's recovery from recession that began after last year's crisis, sending unemployment to near record highs.\n\nA budget official said on Thursday Turkey could boost spending next year for military operations and refugee housing in its proposed Syria \"safe zone.\"", "description": "Turkey's state banks help keep lira flat ahead of Pence visit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9G0SA_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
