Tristan Jarry stopped 27 shots.\n\nMathieu Perreault and Mark Scheifele had goals for the Jets, and Laurent Brossoit finished with 21 saves.\n\nBoth teams were playing back-to-back games and lacked zip in the first period. Perreault scored the opener at 1:47 when a centering puck he flipped in front of the Pittsburgh net glanced off a defender\u2019s stick and past Jarry.\n\nThe celebration was short-lived as Aston-Reese tied it up a few minutes later when, as he was falling to the ice in front of the Winnipeg net, he slipped a loose rebound past Brossoit at 4:09 for his first goal of the season.\n\nGuentzel scored on a power play at 7:50 of the second to give the Penguins the lead and then, just 41 seconds later, a puck bounced behind the net and back out right in front of Lafferty, who slammed it in to make it 3-1.\n\nScheifele narrowed it by backhanding a rebound past Jarry on a power play at the 10-minute mark but Simon restored the two-goal lead with 3 1/2 minutes left as his shot pinballed through traffic before ending up in the Jets\u2019 net. It was also his first of the season.\n\nThe Jets seemed to find more steam at the start of the third after coach Paul Maurice made some line changes but couldn\u2019t turn things around, striking out on their fourth power play.\n\nInstead, Lafferty scored again at 9:32 when his shot glanced off Winnipeg defenseman Anthony Bittetto\u2019s skate. Then Guentzel beat Brossoit for his second of the game and fourth of the season at with 8:20 left to make it 6-2.\n\nAston-Reese scored his second of the game short-handed on a breakaway just 7 seconds into a Winnipeg power play with 5:14 remaining.\n\nNOTES: Winnipeg finished with a 29-28 advantage on shots on goal. \u2026 The Jets had less trouble on their first meeting this season with the Penguins, walking away from PPG Paints Arena with a 4-1 win last Tuesday. \u2026 Patrik Laine picked up an assist on Scheifele\u2019s goal but he couldn\u2019t score despite one great chance right in front of Jarry that went high.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPenguins: Host Colorado on Wednesday night.\n\nJets: Host Arizona in the second game of a six-game homestand.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Zach Aston-Reese, Sam Lafferty and Jake Guentzel each had two goals to lead the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 7-2 win over the Winnipeg Jets on Sunday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/penguins_jets_hockey_24470_c0-162-3900-2437_s1200x700.jpg?c1f1f770fef2fba48b8e857ce4d05e8d5142cf2d", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
