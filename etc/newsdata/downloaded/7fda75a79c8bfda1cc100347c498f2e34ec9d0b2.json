Graham, a native of Milpitas, California who has lived in the Kansas City area for three decades, didn\u2019t seem troubled or upset, Rich Santoro said.\n\n\u201cHe was excited to come. I talked to him five or six times during the night. He was happy he was there. He told me, \u2018I didn\u2019t expect to have this much fun.\u201d\u2019 Santoro said.\n\n\u201cIt turns out he had already set the fires.\u201d\n\nState fire investigators said Graham gave them a different impression. After he was arrested at the airport in San Jose, Graham told them he was in an \u201cemotional\u201d state over the loss of his wife in 2018 when he tossed flaming pieces of paper on to the side of a road.\n\n\u201cBecause she passed away and could not be with him, it made him emotional, starting the fires,\u201d the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection report said.\n\nSantoro recalled Graham being sad about attending the reunion without his wife.\n\nGraham is being held on $2m bail on 13 counts of arson. He also faces two special counts of arson during a state of emergency, which was declared by Governor Gavin Newsom in March, ahead of the wildfire season.\n\nProsecutors said Graham drove through a foothill area north-east of San Jose and set 13 fires over the course of two days.\n\nAlthough the fires caused no injuries or structural damage, they took dozens of firefighters using aircraft, bulldozers and other equipment hours to extinguish.\n\nGraham was identified as the suspect after someone saw him, wrote down his rental car\u2019s license plate number and notified firefighters.\n\nHe was arrested when he was returning a rental car at the airport \u2013 his second of the weekend, after reportedly swapping out the one seen by a witness at the fire.", "description": "Freddie Owen Graham claimed he was in an \u2018emotional\u2019 state when he set the fires, then he went to his high school reunion", "authors": ["Associated Press In Milpitas"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f835686529d9ff1309f26ee26e6cda536a05e91/0_136_5406_3245/master/5406.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7edec7604ac5695920416abcd5d2c656", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
