(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Redskins, adrift for the vast majority of owner Daniel Snyder\u2019s two-decade reign of decay, are further away from resembling a competent operation than they have been since the worst days of Jim Zorn. They are starting over once again after firing Jay Gruden, the longest-tenured head coach of Snyder\u2019s ownership, five games \u2014 all losses \u2014 into his sixth season in Washington.\n\nThe Redskins will move forward this season under interim coach Bill Callahan, but the relevant questions about how the franchise proceeds have no clear answers. Who can Snyder convince to lead his organization? There are only 32 NFL head coaching jobs, as the cliche goes, but any sought-after coach who can exercise his preference would choose one of the other 31. What coach will risk his reputation to work for Snyder and, presuming he is not also canned, Allen? Every other head coach has left diminished by the experience.\n\nUnder those conditions, the hire could not be more important. The next head coach will have to develop a franchise quarterback. It will likely be Dwayne Haskins, the local product taken 15th in last April\u2019s draft. But Washington is so bad this season that the Redskins might end up with one of the draft\u2019s first two picks, which would give them the option of taking super-prospects Tua Tagovailoa of Alabama or Justin Herbert of Oregon.\n\nWashington\u2019s roster is bereft. The team\u2019s management structure is murky, with franchise icon Doug Williams in charge of personnel, longtime executive Eric Schaffer running the salary cap, Allen making final decisions and no fans quite certain of who\u2019s really picking the players. This arrangement has to compete directly in the NFC East with Howie Roseman\u2019s front office in Philadelphia, one of the savviest, most up-to-date and forward-thinking in all of professional sports. It\u2019s not a fair fight.\n\n[Hail or Fail: Jay Gruden\u2019s final game as Redskins coach was another dud]\n\nUnless there are more changes to come after Gruden\u2019s dismissal, though, that\u2019s how Washington will attempt to build something out of the current wreckage. Since Alex Smith broke his leg last season with their record at 6-3, the Redskins are 1-11. Losing a franchise-level quarterback can decimate any team\u2019s hopes. But the Colts lost Andrew Luck to sudden retirement, and they are 3-2 after Sunday\u2019s victory over Patrick Mahomes in Kansas City. Those Eagles won a Super Bowl without Carson Wentz.\n\nIt\u2019s folly to compare Washington to teams of that caliber, of course. But losing Smith did more than set back the Redskins. It exposed their talent level, and it\u2019s clear that talent ranks at the bottom of the NFL.\n\nThe only way that happens is from making bad decisions, born out of a bad decision-making culture. Washington is far from the only terrible team in the NFL, but the other terrible teams at least can see a path forward if they squint.\n\nThe Dolphins have actively torn down their roster to accrue draft picks and open salary cap space. The Jets just hired renowned personnel man Joe Douglas away from Philadelphia. The Bengals hired a young coach from the Sean McVay tree in Zac Taylor. The Cardinals just drafted Kyler Murray first overall and paired him with a new head coach, Kliff Kingsbury, his talents are made for. The Falcons are cycling out of contention, but they have a franchise quarterback and a front office that stays on the analytical cutting edge. The Broncos seem rudderless under John Elway, but they hired a defensive coach to pair with edge rushers Von Miller and Bradley Chubb.\n\n[From September: Daniel Snyder dreamed of owning the Redskins. Two decades in, success remains elusive.]\n\nNot all of those plans will work, and some of them are flawed. But they are clear, obvious ideas for how to succeed. In Washington, could anybody state the plan to rebuild and contend in one clear sentence? The Redskins under Allen don\u2019t have a plan, other than to hope Haskins saves them and lifts a hollow roster.\n\nIn the NFL, implausible ascension happens all the time, and it can happen fast when new quarterbacks and new coaches arrive. Gloom can leave quickly. The Rams were boring and irrelevant for years, and within two seasons of hiring McVay they went to the Super Bowl with third-year quarterback Jared Goff. When an NFL team starts over with a new coach and a new quarterback, the changes are sometimes only cosmetic. But possibilities suddenly become boundless. Having coach and quarterback openings at the same time should be a recipe for justified hope.\n\nBut in Washington, Allen and Snyder have not given fans reason to hold even that belief. Firing Gruden is another sign Washington must think only about its future, and that this season is completely lost, three weeks before Halloween. Snyder and Allen have provided only reason for pessimism about that future. The coach is gone, but the people picking the coaches and the players and setting the culture remain. The restart is here, and the biggest question is still the same: What does it even matter?\n\nRead more:\n\nBrewer: Another Redskins coach fired, and his successor already is destined to fail\n\nEven Tom Brady thought it was \u2018ridiculous\u2019 how many Patriots fans were at FedEx Field\n\nThe key moments from the Redskins\u2019 33-7 loss to the Patriots\n\nColt McCoy has a rough day and two other takeaways from the Redskins\u2019 loss\n\nClayton: Ranking the playoff contenders in a wide-open, deep NFC", "description": "NFL teams can turn things around with new quarterbacks and head coaches.
