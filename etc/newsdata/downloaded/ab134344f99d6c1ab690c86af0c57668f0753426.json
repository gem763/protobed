They said it could take a long time to identify those who have died.\n\nAuthorities were warned last year that people smugglers saw the Irish border as a weak point in the UK border and were taking migrants to Ireland before transporting them to Britain. It is not known whether that happened in this case.\n\nPolice have found 39 dead bodies in the back of a lorry container on an Essex industrial estate\n\nAerial pictures show screens have been put around the back of the white lorry, with forensics tents placed nearby\n\nPolice in forensics suits were seen worked on the cab end of the lorry, which is said to have originated in Bulgaria.

Our enquiries are ongoing to establish what has happened.\n\n'We are in the process of identifying the victims, however I anticipate that this could be a lengthy process.\n\n'We believe the lorry is from Bulgaria and entered the country at Holyhead on Saturday, October 19 and we are working closely with our partners to investigate.\n\n'We have arrested the lorry driver in connection with the incident who remains in police custody as our enquiries continue.'\n\nThe investigation will now try to work out where the people who died came from and what route they had taken to get to the UK.\n\nSeamus Leheny, Northern Ireland policy manager for the Freight Transport Association (FTA), said: 'If the lorry came from Bulgaria, getting into Britain via Holyhead is an unorthodox route.\n\n'People have been saying that security and checks have been increased at places like Dover and Calais, so it might be seen as an easier way to get in by going from Cherbourg or Roscoff, over to Rosslare, then up the road to Dublin.\n\n'It's a long way around and it'll add an extra day to the journey.'\n\nRichard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Society, added 'this tragedy highlights the danger of migrant gangs people-smuggling on lorries'.\n\nPolice have not revealed where they believe the people had travelled from. They say it may take a long time to identify them all\n\nPolice and emergency services were called to the estate last night.

An Iranian man told the BBC how he was flown to Dublin, where there are deemed to be fewer and less rigorous checks, on a false passport, before being transported on to London. An investigation found that, after getting to Ireland, migrants were then being taken to Belfast and onto a ferry to Glasgow. Last summer, migrants were being charged \u00a310,000 each to make the whole journey.

'We've just seen what has been said online. It's awful. We thought maybe someone had broken into a lorry, but it's just awful.'\n\nThe industrial estate is next to the Dartford Crossing and is used as a stopping point for lorries travelling south to the Port of Dover and the Channel Tunnel, although the planned route of the lorry involved is unknown.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel tweeted this morning: 'Shocked and saddened by this utterly tragic incident in Grays. Essex Police has arrested an individual and we must give them the space to conduct their investigations.'\n\nJackie Doyle-Price, the Conservative MP for Thurrock, tweeted: 'Sickening news of 39 people found dead in a container in Grays.\n\n'People trafficking is a vile and dangerous business.
