One bad photo and it's all over.\n\nIn September, photos and a video of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dressed up in blackface on different occasions surfaced. He's apologized. But as he campaigns for a second term as prime minister in next month's election, the photos could have lasting repercussions.\n\nTrudeau isn't the only one to face criticism for controversial photos. American politicians Al Franken, Chris Lee, Anthony Weiner, Gary Hart, Michael Dukakis, John Kerry, and Krystal Ball have all dealt with the fall-out from photos.\n\nHiding such a photo could make a big difference, too. The three images of Trudeau in blackface only emerged near the end of his first term. And a photo of Barack Obama with notorious antisemite and homophobe Louis Farrakhan didn't come to light until 2018, after Obama had already served two terms as president.\n\nThere's also former British Labour Party leader Ed Miliband who has to live with becoming a bacon sandwich-chewing meme.\n\nHere are 13 photos that have \u2014 or could have \u2014 derailed political careers.", "description": "One bad photo can cause everything to change.
