Whether you\u2019re blessed with perfect, porcelain textures or you\u2019re as spotty as can be, you look marvellous.\n\nWe\u2019re saying this because we spent too many of our teenage years worrying about what we looked like when in fact, being kind to others, and more importantly yourself, is the best weapon you can wield.\n\nIn the immortal words of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race behemoth Bianca Del Rio: \u201cBeauty fades, but dumb is forever\u201d. Our teenhoods were dominated with the idea that being nice is uncool and being aggressive gets you ahead. While sadly there is some truth that being a loud-mouth gets you noticed, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019re listened to or are being well-received.\n\nApply this metaphor to skincare for teenagers. The marketing screams about sebum and spots like they\u2019re going out of style. Products are chocked full of corrosive alcohols and silicones for quick astringent fixes and blurring blemish solutions, promising to transform you into a walking Facetune filter.\n\nThose hardy chemicals and stuffed pores will indeed give you a temporary flourish with tight and cantankerously clean skin, feeling very satisfactory indeed. However, youthful skin generally doesn't need to be attacked with so many harsh ingredients, so we urge you to take a breather with a more leisurely stroll rather than a quick sprint. Save that for when you\u2019re older and falling apart.\n\nAcclaimed facialist Kate Kerr puts it very well as she explains: \u201cDuring our teenage years, our skincare regime should focus on prevention and protection. The skin will be functioning beautifully and our regime should predominantly focus on oil control and protection against UV and HEV light with the use of a good SPF.\u201d\n\nThe excess oil that can be produced from hormonal mayhem tends to be your main culprit of potential acne and bad behaviour. So our roundup focus on preventing this from getting out of hand with a curation of cleansers to suit all skin types and a couple of secret weapons if you have unwanted visitors that need shooing respectfully out the door.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice. This revenue helps to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nIndie Lee purifying face wash, 125ml: \u00a332, Naturismo\n\nIndie Lee\u2019s line has gems galore but this cleanser in particular is a joy for teen skin. It\u2019s full of citrus goodness like orange and lavender to dissolve excess sebum while clove, burdock and mandarin give you a brightening lift.\n\nIt\u2019s a liquid formulation which is really good if you prefer whipping up a generous lather, while all the gorgeous natural ingredients contribute to a calmer complexion. This really helped get more unruly blemishes under control with continued use leaving the face restful, refreshed and ready for further instructions.\n\nWe definitely cheerlead this for its lack of synthetic chemicals too, so you can go forth fear-free knowing that you\u2019re not going to clog pores further with any unfavourable surprises. To reiterate, it\u2019s good to feed teen skin with all the goodness it already inhabits and this is a terrific first step towards that.\n\nBuy now\n\nMilk Makeup matcha cleanser, 28ml: \u00a322, Cult Beauty\n\nIt\u2019s hard to remember our shelves without Milk Makeup these days. A few of its products have already become our go-tos only months after arriving on UK soil. The brand's clever sticks are lined up in our bathroom and this matcha cleansing offering is an awesome multitasking treat.\n\nThe matcha and lavender are great for tackling inflammation with exfoliating properties to scrape off any stubborn skin cells. It works like a roll on, so just swipe on dampened skin then massage as you normally would. It\u2019s not a huge latherer so is quite nice if you want a rather simple affair and don\u2019t wear make-up.\n\nIt\u2019s a surprisingly emollient texture and doesn\u2019t dry out the skin thanks to the inclusion of glycerin. It will keep you clean and fresh without feeling sticky with just enough detoxifying agents to keep skin from misbehaving. This is a great daily cleanser for young folks without huge skin concerns as it\u2019s soap free and not full to the brim with crazy promises. It\u2019ll keep skin in check without throwing a wobbly.\n\nBuy now\n\nDr. Roebuck\u2019s kibosh weightless foaming cleanser, 100ml: \u00a320, Space NK\n\nFor something that packs a bit more punch, but equally won\u2019t strip your skin of all its natural goodness, this foaming cleanser from Dr. Roebuck\u2019s is a fab choice.\n\nThe texture is perfect for sensitive or stressed skin as it doesn\u2019t drag on or need too much work to get going. The Tazmanian pepper is glorious to soothe, calm and address redness while Australian wattleseed is also a terrific partner in the inflammation department.\n\nIt\u2019ll get you super-clean while encouraging hydration in all the right places. There\u2019s a plethora of unique ingredients in here which have been carefully formulated specifically for oily-prone skin. We found it was a joy to use and had no drying sensation whatsoever.\n\nPerfect for blemish prone or overly oily skin that needs some extra comfort when cleansing rather than a maniacal overhaul.\n\nBuy now\n\nGlossier mega greens galaxy pack, 89ml: \u00a318, Glossier\n\nA good clay mask should be a part of anyone\u2019s kit from 13 to...well, there\u2019s no age limit. This green beast from Glossier is packed with white clay, which is the mildest form of kaolin so isn\u2019t going to ravage your youthful good looks. It\u2019ll give those pores a spring clean, while aloe and avocado oil work on nourishing and soothing.\n\nThere\u2019s a tingle when you slap it on but it\u2019s not overpowering. It dries down to a thinner layer with a satisfyingly tightening sensation. Uniquely, for a clay mask, this feels very moisturising when you wash it off, leaving the skin squeaky clean but not desert dry.\n\nThere\u2019s nibbles of parsley and spinach in here which seem to do just as much on your face as they do in your tum. We got to grips with this twice a week for a good clear out. Use this with a milder cleanser prior so you\u2019re not too parched. On the other days if you\u2019re seeing excess oil return, step up the cleanser to something a little more powerful and add this for a third time in the week.\n\nBuy now\n\nOY! clear skin cleansing moisturiser, 50ml: \u00a311.50, Green People\n\nThe aptly titled Green People not only strive to create affordable, organic skincare, it also created OY! which is a range specifically targeted at young skin. The founder Charlotte Vohtz started the brand after trying to discover something to help with her daughter\u2019s skin issues. Sadly, we weren\u2019t as spoilt in the Nineties and so she went on to champion change in the industry with its manifesto.\n\nThe brand stringently avoids a list of ingredients that it believes aren\u2019t necessary to include, such as bad alcohols and synthetic fragrances.\n\nThis moisturiser is our pick from the OY! selection with its non-greasy and non-comedogenic formula. It has a welcoming citrus scent with a light and fast absorbing texture. Willow bark is here to kill bacteria while green tea is a good anti-inflammatory. There\u2019s also a sprinkle of prebiotics in here to help bring balance to the skin.\n\nThere are a few ingredients in here on the richer side such as shea butter and rosehip oil and therefore would be a formidable option for drier skin types too.\n\nBuy now\n\nGoldfaden MD vital boost even skintone daily moisturiser, 50ml: \u00a360, Space NK\n\nGoldfaden MD is another brand who prides itself on using organic and natural ingredients to form a fuss-free and results driven line. Vital boost is its cult moisturiser which has grapefruit oil to help cleanse and even skin tone while gooseberry extract is a big vitamin C asset to the formula. There\u2019s our favourite hyaluronic acid in here to add a bit of hydration too.\n\nThere\u2019s no greasy residue which is of course welcomed but what we liked about this most was that it gave a semi-matte finish. It adds a subtle dewy tint to the overall appearance.\n\nThis is a lush moisturiser with just the right amount of all the good stuff. Antioxidants work in your favour gradually over time to fend off stresses from the outside world and keep you in check.\n\nBuy now\n\nFarsali unicorn essence, 10ml: \u00a320, Cult Beauty\n\nFarsali unicorn essence is a hybrid elixir that works beautifully as a primer, while serving a delicious drink of skincare goodness at the same time.\n\nFounder Sal Ali felt there was a gap in the market after seeing his wife\u2019s mayhem at her vanity desk. Farsali was born with the will for products to bridge the gap between make-up and skincare. It\u2019s full to the brim with antioxidant-rich super-fruits that work on protecting the skin from the elements. Acai, blueberry, goji and elderberry are high in vitamin C so with continued use, your skin should certainly look brighter, lifting acne scars over time.\n\nVitamin C is a gold-standard ingredient and a great option for skin-conscious teens. Think about it. We squeeze lemon over avocado to slow down the ripening process. Not that we\u2019re equating your face to an avocado, but the analogy stands firm. Keep the spirits up on the surface and you\u2019ll fend off unwanted goblins rising from beneath.\n\nWe tried the renowned technique of applying highlighter to the serum when still slightly tacky. Unicorns would be crying at the result, we assure you.\n\nBuy now\n\nDermalogica clearing fizz mask, 50ml: \u00a319.50, Feel Unique\n\nSometimes you do just need to pull out the big guns. If you\u2019re at a last resort and want a mega quick fix for blackheads, this is where to come.\n\nDermalogica\u2019s clear start range is geared towards younger, blemish-prone skin and this fizzy, targeted mask literally dissolves impurities on the skin\u2019s surface. Sulfur takes charge here and will drill down where other exfoliators can\u2019t reach. Spread a thin layer on your T-zone and leave for a few minutes max. You\u2019ll experience a slight tingling sensation while the concoction bubbles. Simply wipe off when your timer goes off.\n\nIt opens pores and sweeps out gunk allowing for a much less agonising extraction. If you play by the fizzy rules with this one and give yourself some TLC post application, you might just have found your new bestie in the blackhead fight.\n\nBuy now\n\nVotary blemish rescue oil, 15ml: \u00a335, Liberty\n\nEven if you\u2019ve finally got yourself to a place you\u2019re happy with, you might occasionally find an unwanted visitor from time to time. You don\u2019t want to upset the rest of your face you\u2019ve worked really hard to get under control. So sometimes you want a little tactical help.\n\nIt\u2019s a myth that blemishes disappear by drying them out as that just makes them angrier. Instead we found this mighty mini from Votary. Salicylic acid is the perfect accompaniment to dissolve dead skin cells and exfoliates the top layer of skin. The blend acts as a comfort blanket while tamanu oil works on healing acne scars over time.\n\nThis leaves skin feeling healed and soft after using twice a day after cleansing. Blemishes were reduced considerably. Make sure you use sparingly as less is more with this one.\n\nBuy now\n\nSVR sebiaclear daily sunscreen SPF50, 50ml: \u00a317, Look Fantastic\n\nYou are never too young for sunscreen. Sun damage is the biggest culprit for ageing and the main contributor towards damaging your future skin. So to keep that youthful complexion in your proverbial pocket, this one from SVR is a great place to start.\n\nIt\u2019s infused with niacinamide which is the porefecting wonder ingredient for tightening pores and brightening, while gluconolactone is a PHA which is a much gentler acid in the family to provide some exfoliation even for sensitive skin. While some sunscreens can be greasy, this one helps keep you shine-free with a supportive mattifying formula. It\u2019s lightweight and non-disruptive.\n\nBuy now\n\nDisciple good skin face oil, 20ml: \u00a323, Cult Beauty\n\nYes it\u2019s oil! No, don\u2019t panic! Disciple prides itself on giving a leg up to struggling skin types. Founded by psychotherapist Charlotte Ferguson, she\u2019s a whizz at marrying both skin and soul.\n\nLet\u2019s break this one down. The turmeric oil helps heal and calm redness. Geranium helps calm hormones naturally while bad bacteria fighting prebiotics on the backburner help clarify. It\u2019s a natural, clean and potent brightening beauty.\n\nJust four or five drops used at nighttime on the face is enough or simply add it to your moisturiser for a boost. We gave this to someone who was suffering from a small burst of eczema at the time and we\u2019re proud to say it aided towards a speedier recovery. It\u2019s a unique blend that you can tell has been made with love.\n\nBuy now\n\neos crystal melon blossom lip balm, 7g: \u00a37, Boots\n\nDon\u2019t forget your pout. Now winter\u2019s coming, if you\u2019re going to put all your efforts into getting your skin balanced, crusty lips aren\u2019t going to cut it.\n\nThese egg shaped eos numbers twist to reveal a bauble of lip softening goodness. What\u2019s nice about this melon one in particular is that it hydrates without feeling too heavy on the lips. It\u2019s a mixture of castor, avocado and coconut oils which leaves lips feeling matte but sufficiently soft.\n\nA perky choice for those that don\u2019t like slathering their lips in sugary, rich creams for a bit of a relief from an outside onslaught. Weightless and wax-free, you\u2019ll probably collect so many you\u2019ll get them confused for Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nBuy now\n\nPur skin perfecting powder balancing act, 8ml: \u00a322, Pur Cosmetics\n\nThe instinctive thing to do when skin plays up is to cover it with a multitude of products so you can\u2019t see anything underneath. Truth be told, suffocating your face on the daily doesn\u2019t, literally, give it time to catch its breath. As a compromise, Pur\u2019s skin balancing powder might be a nice crossroads to inspire a bit of confidence without a full mask of make-up.\n\nThere\u2019s no traditional coverage in here, but there\u2019s a significant lack of drying agents that are usually found in mattifying powders. In Pur\u2019s we have green tea leaf extract, great for anti-redness, and lactic acid for a clearing boost.\n\nThis is a quick fix to keep in your bag to whip out when you need it most. It doesn\u2019t dry skin like generic powders and does oil control differently via a more caring and thoughtful formulation.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Skincare products for teens\n\nIndie Lee's purifying face wash will help any skin type start anew. Disciple's good skin oil is great too. Get SVR sunscreen ASAP!\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
