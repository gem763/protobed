But she remains mired in the middle of the pack in early-state and national polls that usually show her trailing Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nThe kind of realignment outlined in the memo from campaign manager Juan Rodriguez is typical at this stage of the campaign, as the fourth quarter begins and final decisions are being made on how to best deploy staff and purchase advertising time. Longtime political observers in Iowa and leaders of rival presidential campaigns have agreed in recent weeks that staffing decisions ahead of the Iowa caucus on February 3 must be in place by November 1 in order to succeed.\n\nAs the memo states, \"Plenty of winning primary campaigns, like John Kerry's in 2004 and John McCain's in 2008, have had to make tough choices on their way to the nomination, and this is no different.\"\n\nBy this time in 2003, Kerry was making plans to mortgage his Boston home to help keep his campaign afloat and in 2007, McCain was down to a skeleton operation after hemorrhaging staff. But he doubled down on his town hall appearances in New Hampshire and ultimately prevailed.\n\nNews of the realignment was first reported by Politico.\n\nIn the memo, Rodriguez says he will take a pay cut, \"along with all consultants, we will trim and renegotiate contracts, and we will also reduce the size of our headquarters staff. These decisions are difficult but will ensure the campaign is positioned to execute a robust Iowa ground game and a minimum 7-figure paid media campaign in the weeks leading up to the caucus.\"\n\nStaffers from campaign offices in New Hampshire, Nevada and California and some from Baltimore headquarters will be sent to Iowa \"for the home stretch of the caucus campaign,\" the memo says.\n\nThis move mirrors what candidates like Jeb Bush in 2016 had to do \u2014 clear out his Miami national headquarters and send personnel to Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nFinally, the Harris memo states the senator \"will continue to spend significant time in Iowa\" in November, including spending Thanksgiving in the state.\n\n\"She is determined to earn the support of every caucus goer she can in the next 96 days,\" Rodriguez writes.\n\nOpting to all-but move a candidate to Iowa has worked with mixed success in the past. Then-Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut moved his young family to Iowa in 2007 but still placed last in the 2008 Democratic caucus and dropped out of the race. But Republicans Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum used solitary aggressive Iowa plans in 2008 and 2012, respectively, and won the state.\n\nHarris and most of the Democratic presidential field is set to spend the weekend in Iowa for some of the final major all-candidate gatherings before he caucus. A major state party dinner will draw the contenders to a downtown Des Moines rally on Friday night, while freshman Democratic Representative Abby Finkenauer is holding a fish fry Saturday in Cedar Rapids set to be attended by eight candidates.", "description": "Harris is significantly curtailing and reshaping her presidential campaign in a bid to cut costs and boost her standing", "authors": ["Ed O'Keefe"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/30/b1a9ce41-5984-41e8-940b-5839d563b9e7/thumbnail/1200x630g3/42fe230e87d23580cb46b72e191f8390/gettyimages-1180322311.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
