He was never seen leaving the building\n\nIn one part of the tape they can reportedly be heard laughing and joking before Khashoggi entered the room.\n\nAccording to a UN report published earlier this year the writer, who has been critical of the Saudi government, was drugged with a sedative and suffocated with a plastic bag.\n\nIn a BBC Panorama episode to be aired this evening to mark one year on from the brutal murder, human rights expert Agnes Callamard, who wrote the UN report, and British criminal barrister Helena Kennedy discuss what they heard on the covert tapes.\n\nVery few people have heard these chilling recordings that reveal the details of what happened to Khashoggi, the hit squad sent to kill him and the cover-up that followed.\n\nWashington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi had criticised the Saudi government\n\nNews programmes worldwide showed CCTV images of the last time Khashoggi was seen alive as he entered the consulate building.\n\nBut the tapes reveal the disturbing conversations happening inside at that very moment between the leader of the operation, Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, and a forensic pathologist, Dr Salah al Tubaigy.\n\nSpeaking to Panorama, Kennedy describes Tubaigy talking about what is going to happen to Khashoggi: 'It's just so cold and callous. He says ''it's the first time in my life that I'll have had to cut pieces on the ground. Even if you're a butcher and you want to cut\u2026he hangs the animal up to do so''.\n\n'You can hear them laughing. It's a sort of chilling business. They're waiting there knowing that this man is going to come in and he's going to be murdered.'\n\nKhashoggi is heard on the tapes being greeted by his killers as he arrives at the Saudi consulate.\n\nKennedy adds: 'There was a point where you can hear Khashoggi moving from being a man who's a confident person, towards a sense of fear; a sense of anxiety; rising anxiety; rising terror and then knowing that something fatal is about to happen'.\n\nWhile Khashoggi was inside the building his Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, was outside waiting for his return.\n\nCallamard said it is possible Khashoggi believed he was only going to be abducted rather than murdered.\n\nShe added: 'I don't know whether he thinks he could be killed. He certainly thinks that they could try to abduct him.\n\nUN rapporteur Agnes Callamard, who investigated the murder of Jamal Khashoggi speaking on BBC Panorama\n\nCCTV footage of Jamal Khashoggi and his fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, at an apartment building in Istanbul just hours before his death in the Saudi Arabian consulate\n\n'He's asking 'are you going to do that to me? Are you going to give me an injection?... The sounds that are heard after that point indicate that he's suffocated, probably with a plastic bag over his head.'\n\nJust 30 minutes after Khashoggi entered the consulate, his body was being dismembered by Tubaigy.\n\nKennedy added: 'You hear a voice saying ''let him cut''\u2026 and then somebody shouting ''it's over, it's over''.'\n\nThe recordings also refute the Saudis claim that Khashoggi's death was a rogue operation, with the tapes exposing several phone calls in the days leading up to the murder that set the plan in motion.\n\nKennedy says: 'There is no doubt in my mind that this was a seriously, highly organised mission coming from the top. This was not some flaky maverick operation'.\n\nThe programme hears more evidence that responsibility for the murder goes to the highest levels of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and asks whether the West has turned a blind eye to state sanctioned murder in the interests of maintaining trading relationships.\n\nKennedy said: 'Something treacherous and terrible happened in that embassy. The international community has a responsibility to insist on a high level judicial enquiry.'\n\nThe Saudi embassy in London said that they 'condemn the abhorrent killing of Jamal Khashoggi inside the consulate and they are committed to holding the perpetrators accountable'.\n\nKhashoggi, a contributor to the Washington Post, was killed on October 2 shortly after entering the kingdom's consulate (pictured) in what Riyadh called a 'rogue' operation\n\nCCTV footage has emerged allegedly showing Jamal Khashoggi's body parts being carried into Saudi Arabia's consul residence in bags and suitcases on the day he was murdered\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told CBS News on Sunday that he did not order the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi\n\nIn an interview with CBS 60 Minutes yesterday Bin Salman said he takes 'full responsibility' for the grisly murder of Khashoggi as it happened 'under my watch', but denied allegations he ordered the killing.\n\nThe 34-year-old crown prince said: 'This was a heinous crime. But I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.'\n\nAsked if he ordered the murder of Khashoggi, the crown prince described the slaying was 'a mistake' and replied: 'Absolutely not'.\n\nAgents of the Saudi government killed Khashoggi inside the consulate and apparently dismembered his body, which has never been found.\n\nSaudi Arabia has charged 11 people in the slaying and put them on trial, which has been held in secret. As of yet, no one has been convicted.\n\nA United Nations report asserted that Saudi Arabia bore responsibility for the killing and said the crown prince's possible role in it should be investigated.\n\nIn Washington, Congress has said it believes the crown prince is 'responsible for the murder.'\n\nSaudi Arabia has long insisted the crown prince had no involvement in an operation that included agents who reported directly to him.", "description": "Saudi authorities did not realise their consulate in Istanbul was being bugged by the Turkish government, meaning the execution of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year was recorded.", "authors": ["Chris Dyer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/10/19100472-0-image-a-19_1569835693640.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
