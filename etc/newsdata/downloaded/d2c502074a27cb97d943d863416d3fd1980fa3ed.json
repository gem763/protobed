(NASA/AP)\n\nLooking for cool Friday night plans? How about watching the largest spacecraft ever created zip across the sky at 4.76 miles per second?\n\nThe International Space Station is slated to make a bright pass over the Eastern Seaboard on Friday night, visible from cities such as Washington, Philadelphia, New York and Boston. In fact, anyone from Florida through Canada can enjoy the show.\n\nTo make things even better, the weather is expected to be superb. Mostly clear skies will dominate the East Coast, with crisp, refreshing dryness sledging all the way down the Appalachians.\n\nFor folks in Florida or Georgia, look to the south-southwest at 7:56 p.m. The space station will arc its way higher over the sky before fading off into the northeast about six minutes later. Farther north, it will be a touch later \u2014 7:58 p.m. in D.C., 7:59 p.m. in New York, and 8 p.m. in Boston. It will be bright enough that folks in well-lit, downtown areas can enjoy the spectacle.\n\nThe International Space Station will look like a swiftly moving airplane, although it won\u2019t be blinking. Any light you see does not come from the space station. (After all, it\u2019s not as if it risks hitting any errant deer in space, so the ISS doesn\u2019t have headlights.) Instead, it\u2019s reflected sunlight glinting off the station\u2019s solar panels. Because the International Space Station is so high, it can catch the sunlight even after the sun has set for some on Earth below.\n\nThe International Space Station, built in 1998, has made nearly 120,000 orbits. It soars across the sky some 294 miles above Earth. That\u2019s 50 times higher than most commercial airliners fly.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the space station is not immune to gravity. It feels a lot of gravitational pull toward earth. Being onboard the space station diminishes the force of gravity by only about 10 percent.\n\nBut no need to duck and cover; the space station is not going to \u201cfall\u201d down. But it is constantly in free fall. However, its extreme forward speed allows it to \u201coutrun\u201d the distance gravity would have it fall during a given interval, balancing out and maintaining its constant altitude. However, if the ISS were to slow down, it would spiral inward toward Earth.\n\nIt\u2019s just like when you were a kid. Remember going outside, tying a rope to a bucket filled with water, and careening it vertically around in circles? If you spin fast enough, the water stays in the bucket. . . . but if you stop spinning, PLOP! That\u2019s because centrifugal (outward) force balances gravitational (downward/inward) force. Of course, in the space station\u2019s case, \u201cdown\u201d is relative, simply meaning toward Earth.\n\nBecause the International Space Station is so close to Earth, it must travel quite fast to escape falling; that\u2019s why we see it moving across the sky so quickly.\n\nIf we want the satellite to remain \u201clocked\u201d with Earth\u2019s rotation, peering down at the same place, we have to go way farther out in space. Eventually, we\u2019ll get to a point where gravity is less, meaning the satellite can travel at a slower forward speed to remain suspended and an angular speed that matches Earth\u2019s rotation rate. What\u2019s this height? 22,236 miles! We call that the height of \u201cgeosync.\u201d The GOES weather satellites orbit at that height.\n\nPretty cool, right? Friday night will offer a great science lesson for the kids, too. So set an alarm on your phone, and keep an eye out for something (sort of) out of this world.", "description": "It's not a bird.
