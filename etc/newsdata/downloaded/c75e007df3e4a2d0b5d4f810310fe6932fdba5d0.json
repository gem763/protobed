We always find a way.\"\n\nCHEO had its highest September patient load ever last month. The children's hospital is taking a closer look at how to accommodate what's expected to be a challenging winter. (CBC)\n\nRoughly half get flu vaccine\n\nMeanwhile, Ottawa Public Health (OPH) is working to alleviate the strain of the flu season through vaccination.\n\nMarie-Claude Turcotte, program manager for immunization, said an estimated 50 per cent of the region's population take the vaccine.\n\n\"Our main goal is to prevent the spread of the flu through the community,\" said Turcotte. \"And of course, that helps the hospital, with fewer people being sick and presenting to the emergency.\"\n\nOPH is only now beginning to receive the vaccine, which will be distributed in early November.\n\nThe Ottawa Hospital did not see similarly high volumes in September, according to spokesperson Michaela Schreiter. However, across the river, both the Gatineau Hospital and the Hull Hospital have been severely over capacity for several weeks.\n\nThe Hull hospital reached 160 per cent capacity Friday morning, while the previous Friday it was at 212 per cent capacity.\n\nCHEO spokespeople say the situation in Quebec doesn't help alleviate emergency rooms in Ontario.", "description": "Patient volumes at eastern Ontario's\u00a0children's hospital were among the highest ever last month, and that has officials there bracing for a potentially difficult flu season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5289004.1568850513!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/vaccine-and-syringe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
