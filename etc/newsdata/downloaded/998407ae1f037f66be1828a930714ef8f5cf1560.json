Following the reset, multiple players are suspected to have started launching DDoS attacks at the company's servers.\n\nThe cheating players have been using the DDoS attacks to trigger server lag and slow down matches. The goal was to annoy opponents, who in many cases would end up disconnecting and receiving a penalty for leaving the match, allowing the player who launched the DDoS attack to gain rank points undeserved.\n\nThe DDoS attacks have been widespread as several players got wind of the trick and started renting DDoS firepower from online DDoS for-hire sites.\n\nBecause Ubisoft hosts three Rainbox Six Siege matches per server, one attacker usually ends up ruining up to multiple matches at a time, impacting far more players than their direct opponents.\n\nThe DDoS wave hasn't gone unnoticed, and a quick YouTube search returns countless videos from complaining players and video game streamers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n\nLegal route is highly unlikely to succeed\n\nIf Ubisoft's plan to use cease & desist letters will work is up for debate. After all, DDoS booters provide illegal services. It's not like they have an incentive to follow the law. Everything these services provide is criminal in nature.\n\nUbisoft's other DDoS mitigation measures will most likely play a more significant role in reducing the attacks' impact on its platform.\n\nThese additional solutions include hosting each Rainbox Six Siege match on a separate server, banning players believed to be behind the attacks, and removing the penalty for disconnecting from matches where DDoS attacks have been observed.\n\nAdditional measures are also being developed together with Microsoft Azure's team, Ubisoft said; however, these will take some time to complete and have no rollout deadline.", "description": "Because all cybercriminals are law-abiding citizens and have a legal department.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/19/63ac0ec3-7744-4b0d-b332-cf07b0953794/thumbnail/770x578/f9ca333d03fd3d4d94573c0622b89e83/ubisoft.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
