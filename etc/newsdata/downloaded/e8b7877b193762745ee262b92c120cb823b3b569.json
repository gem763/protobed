Jemisin Discusses The Tough Questions Far Sector's New Green Lantern Asks About Policing", "language": "en", "text": "Because Sojourner \u201cJo\u201d Mullein \u2014 the Green Lantern at the centre of writer N.K. Jemisin and artist Jamal Campbell\u2019s upcoming series Far Sector \u2014 is stationed countless lightyears away from Earth on a strange planet where emotion no longer exists, her humanity is one of the things that most makes her stand out.\n\nBeing able to feel is what made Jo good at her job as an officer with the NYPD before she was fired from the force, an event that would lead to her joining the Lantern Corps and taking on a unique assignment in one of the farthest reaches of the galaxy.\n\nWhen I spoke with Hugo winner Jemisin recently, she was candid about the real-world questions about policing, police brutality and what it means to be an officer of the law that Jo\u2019s mulling over in Far Sector\u2019s pages.\n\nJo isn\u2019t just a space cop, Jemisin explained, she\u2019s a black woman who turned in her badge at a time when Black Lives Matter protests were taking place across America. She\u2019s someone who has a healthy distrust of any and all police organisations, and she\u2019s doing everything she can to keep fighting the good fight on her own terms.\n\nN.K. Jemisin: Super-big picture? The idea came to me from Gerard Way, so I cannot claim to have come up with Sojourner.\n\nHe contacted me and was like, \u201cYou want to do a Green Lantern? A Young Animal-style Green Lantern, basically.\u201d And he wanted to call them Far Sector \u2014 he had the name in mind already. \u201cAnd we want it to involve the first known Green Lanterns in this unique society.\u201d\n\nThe catch was they hadn\u2019t thought of any of the details beside that. So... he basically contacted me with that and I ran from there.\n\nI wasn\u2019t familiar with Green Lantern, beyond watching episodes of the animated Justice League series. I was familiar with John Stewart, so for a long time, I didn\u2019t realise Hal Jordan was supposed to be, like, \u201cthe main\u201d Green Lantern. But... for the longest time, I was like, \u201cWhy is he white?\u201d [laughing]\n\nI decided to do this, the idea sort of spun out in my head \u2014 the concept of the City Enduring \u2014 the city when the story takes place, which is a giant Dyson swarm of connected platforms around a sun, not a Dyson sphere. It hosts 20 billion people and it counts itself as one city, but it\u2019s a city of, basically, planets.\n\nSo, three different species. I wanted them to be species with a history of conflict, where they\u2019re still trying to work past all that. I\u2019m interested in conflicting societies and things like that.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re relatively new to the Green Lantern mythos has me curious. People joke about them being space cops and don\u2019t stop to think about what all that means. To enforce justice throughout an entire galaxy with \u201cjustice\u201d as a singular concept. For you, personally, in crafting this story about a very unique lantern, what\u2019s your read on the Lantern Corps as an organisation?\n\nJemisin: Well, the first thing I did to try to gain some familiarity with the history was read the gigantic hardcover compilation of Geoff Johns\u2019 issues. One of the things I was trying to do was understand all the different retcons and it became clear I\u2019m not going to be able to keep track of all of it. So, yay.\n\nThe good thing is I\u2019m working in the YA area, so I can kind of discard some of this history. But I did need to understand that fundamental space cop aspect of things.\n\nMy first thought is they\u2019re a giant organisation of police, so I need to treat them like a giant organisation of police.\n\nEven though Jo is going to be effectively the frontier sheriff compared to the rest of them, she\u2019s not in any contact with the rest of the Lantern Corps at this point. She basically is kind of on her own in a place that\u2019s not part of the 36 hundred sectors of the Lantern Corps is charged with overseeing.\n\nI wanted to understand her compared to a large organisation of cops, and I wanted to leave it clear that she chose to do this because she\u2019s coming from the NYPD herself, and she was dealing with the NYPD during the period of Black Lives Matter marches \u2014 stuff like that.\n\nShe\u2019s got some history of discomfort being part of a larger organisation that has some fucking problems. I actually reached out to NYPD in hopes I could get in touch with their press liaison... but... nothing. Silence. I actually have a friend who\u2019s an NYPD cop who was willing to talk to me about some things, off the record. So that helped a little bit.\n\nJo meeting with the Full Trilogy Council. (Image: Jamal Campbell, DC Comics)\n\nWithout getting into spoiler-y specifics, what are the aspects of the cop experience you wanted to elevate to the surface through this story?\n\nJemisin: Hmm. What I really wanted to come to explore was the choice to valorise image and organisation over justice. We\u2019ve heard this described as the Blue Wall of Silence.\n\nJo\u2019s history is NYPD, but she got fired for reasons that will become clear in the comic and she\u2019s chosen to do this thing with the Lanterns now, because she will be on her own, because she will not be part of the Lantern organisation.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t trust organisations anymore because she\u2019s concerned that, as with the NYPD, there was a tendency to privilege what was good for the organisation over what was good for the people. I have some strong feelings about that community \u2014 American police in general. But I wanted to try to do a nuanced take on it.\n\nI don\u2019t hate the police or anything like that. I want to make that point clear. The reason I reached out to the NYPD was because I wanted to get their take on some stuff I had heard from actual employees, and I wanted to know, \u201cWhat\u2019s the reasoning behind this? The NYPD is an organisation, and there\u2019s some rationale I\u2019m not getting.\u201d And again: I got no response from them.\n\nJo still genuinely wants to be a good cop. How would she then work through her own feelings of complicity, because she was part of an organisation who did some shitty stuff? What does justice mean in this context?\n\nYou\u2019ve blown through a lot of my specific questions about Jo, which is fabulous. But now I want to get into things about the races of the City Enduring. In particular, talk to me about the power dynamic between the Nah, @AT and keh-Topli.\n\nJemisin: There\u2019s a whole history here. The short version of it is, they are three races that developed in a unique solar system. Two biological species developed on it, and then one of them spun off a cybernetic species of AIs that became a race of their own.\n\nHistorically, all three races were mostly cooperative with each other and developed together, but when another more technologically advanced empire began colonising the planets, they sowed dissension amongst the three native species. The whole divide and conquer thing.\n\nThat immediately set off a conflict of literally apocalyptic proportions between the peoples and their planets and now, the survivors have rebuilt their society, but they came to realise that part of their problem was them being very, very emotional. Like, when they get mad, they get super mad.\n\nSo, they decided to impose something called the Emotion Exploit on themselves. Which, basically, is a way of suppressing all emotion. And that\u2019s working out for them in mixed ways.\n\nHow do members of each species, sort of, fit into society in the City Enduring?\n\nJemisin: Well, the Nah \u2014 the ones who look most human \u2014 are kind of the ascendant race, through their wealthiest and power.\n\nThe @AT, who are the AI species, are struggling economically and in every other way right now, because, without the Emotion Exploit, they are deprived of something kind of crucial that they need to survive. So, a lot of them are poor. A lot of them are struggling just to get by. There\u2019s a lot of organised crime among them because that\u2019s one of the ways they found to survive.\n\nAnd the keh-Topli are the plant species. They\u2019re struggling a bit, too, but in a more spiritual way because they\u2019re carnivorous plants and they\u2019re not allowed to eat people anymore and that\u2019s caused them some existential angst.\n\nWhen I was speaking with Jamal [Campbell] earlier this week, he began to break it down to me \u2014 the way the @AT and keh-Topli can physically comport themselves to look more like the Nah, aesthetically. That they\u2019re not necessarily presenting themselves as they naturally are. Are there other ways we\u2019ll see that explored throughout the series?\n\nJemisin: I kind of encapsulate it because I didn\u2019t want to hit people with too much. There\u2019s a lot going on here \u2014 when you\u2019re introducing people to a completely different world, you have to introduce things in drips and drabs and focus on what\u2019s most important.\n\nSo yes, the keh-Topli normally look like big venus fly traps. And they contort themselves to look more like the Naa, because the Naa is the most powerful species.\n\nThe @AT, same thing. They don\u2019t have bodies. Normally, they exist only in, effectively, cyberspace \u2014 but when they project bodies for themselves, they tend to project bodies that look mostly like Naa. Most of them have trouble with fingers. So, there\u2019s little things like wealthy @AT are actually able to articulate fingers, the rest wear mittens. Little things like that.\n\nFrom left to right: Lumir by the Cliffs, By the Wavering Dark. Marth of the Sea, By the Wavering Dark, Until the Sun Falls. Averupp Thorn. @BLAZEOFGLORY.

It\u2019s really obviously this wild, new Lantern adventure, but more than just the fun of it, what do you want people to walk away thinking of?\n\nJemisin: I don\u2019t intend for people to come up with anything. End of day, I want people to just feel like this is a good story. To me, a good story leaves them thinking about how societies are structured and how criminal justice actually operates \u2014 how government, in some cases, defend themselves instead of their people. Things like that.\n\nI want people to think about these things, because, to me, that\u2019s what makes a good story. But if they want to just do, \u201cOh my god, the new Green Lantern\u2019s eyebrow game is always on point. It\u2019s the best.\u201d That\u2019s cool, too. Because we did discuss that, Jamal and I.\n\nSince you bring it up, Jo\u2019s look \u2014 I\u2019m a sucker for a solid costume. You\u2019ve seen a couple Green Lanterns, you\u2019re like, \u201cOK. Sure, why not?\u201d But Jo\u2019s outfit... my goodness. I\u2019m a big Janelle Monae fan and we see the pompadour and the glasses \u2014 how much of this is you and how much is Jamal?\n\nJemisin: Just a quick note that Shawn Martinbrough came up with Jo\u2019s initial look. So we were working, at one point, on coming up with background sketches \u2014 Jamal basically retained the basic look. I suggested Janelle Monae and a couple of her, at the time, looks as a sort of basic \u2014 this was before Dirty Computer, where she changed her aesthetic.\n\nSo... Jamal took it from there, added the glasses, came up with different looks for the uniform... I\u2019m not a super visually-oriented person. There\u2019s a whole language of costume I am not big on, or grasp I guess. Because, to me, the words mean more. This was a whole revelation \u2014 this whole process of working on comic books.\n\nSo, to me, it was important her stylishness shown through. That her costume had accessories. Because, of course, she\u2019s going to accessorise. She\u2019s gonna make sure she looks her best at all times.\n\nThere\u2019d be points where she\u2019s mulling energy and in her civvies and she can\u2019t do the completely put together look \u2014 but she\u2019s a black woman who is used to being in a hostile environment and having to look her best at all times. She is now in another completely different hostile environment, but her survival skills remain. And I want that to come across at all times.\n\nIt\u2019s a rhetorical question, but I feel I gotta to ask \u2014 in a story like this, I feel a certain kind of reader might not be inclined to understand why, in this foreign, alien setting, Jo being a black woman from America might not inform her perspective. How does Jo\u2019s black American background factor into the way she is a piece of this alien story?\n\nJemisin: Jo\u2019s a black woman coming from at least two marginalised groups in American society and had to develop specific survival skills because of her reality.\n\nNow she\u2019s taking on a completely alien society where she\u2019s the representative of her species, the Lantern Corps, and people with feelings. She\u2019s aware... not just aware of these things about herself, she\u2019s constantly conscious about it.\n\nThere are people who are not going to get it, that\u2019s fine \u2014 not everybody has to get everything and still you can still appreciate this as a good, fun, rollicking adventure story. The story has layers.\n\nYour willingness to engage in subtext, or subtleties or power dynamics dictate how much of the story you\u2019re going to be able to chew on. How deep people are willing to delve into the layers depends on them.", "description": "Because Sojourner \u201cJo\u201d Mullein \u2014 the Green Lantern at the centre of writer N.K.
