The previous youngest winner of an OWGR event was Ryo Ishikawa, who was 15 years, 8 months when he won on the Japan Golf Tour in 2007.\n\nHill is two months younger.\n\nHill, born and raised in Dubai by English parents, was three shots behind going into the final round at Al Ain Equestrian Shooting and Golf Club. His 62 gave him a two-shot victory over Harry Ellis of England.\n\nBecause Hill is an amateur, Ellis received the $13,500 first prize.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Josh Hill became the youngest winner of a sanctioned tour event Wednesday when the 15-year-old amateur from Dubai shot 8-under 62 to win the Al Ain Open on the MENA Tour.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
