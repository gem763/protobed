After more than five hours of deliberation, he announced that this year\u2019s \u00a350,000 award would be split between Atwood\u2019s follow-up to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, The Testaments, and Evaristo\u2019s polyphonic novel Girl, Woman, Other. Told in the voices of 12 different characters, mostly black women, Evaristo has said that the novel, her eighth, stems from the fact that \u201cwe black British women know that if we don\u2019t write ourselves into literature, no one else will\u201d.\n\nWhen pressed on Monday night if Evaristo would miss out on the attention afforded a single Booker winner, Florence said that splitting the prize means that \u201cwe would like to give equal prominence to these two people \u2026 I would also suggest quietly that Bernadine Evaristo is a very highly established writer who, whilst there is no one in quite the same [fame] bracket as Atwood, is not someone who is totally unknown or likely to disappear.\u201d\n\nGirl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo review \u2013 joy as well as struggle Read more\n\nEvaristo becomes the first black woman, and the first black British writer, to win the Booker since it was launched in 1969. She said after the announcement: \u201cI hope that honour doesn\u2019t last too long. I hope other people come forward now\u201d, and thanked the judges, who include \u201ctwo women of colour, making history\u201d. Asked if she would have preferred to win the full \u00a350,000, she said: \u201cWhat do you think? Yes, but I\u2019m happy to share it. That\u2019s the kind of person I am.\u201d\n\nOthers condemned the decision. Sunny Singh, co-founder of the Jhalak prize for the best book by a writer of colour, said she was furious at the news, while a former Booker judge, who asked to remain anonymous, said they felt it was a \u201chuge disappointment that the chance to make history emphatically was passed by\u201d.\n\nSam Leith, another former Booker judge, called the decision to split the prize an \u201cepic fail\u201d, which sets \u201ca rotten, rotten precedent\u201d and is \u201cunfair on both authors\u201d.\n\n\u201cBernardine, on stage, spoke very graciously about how thrilled she was to be sharing the prize with \u2018the legend that is Margaret Atwood\u2019. But, as she was too gracious to say, it obviously would have been even more thrilling to have beaten that legend into joint second place,\u201d he wrote in an essay.\n\n\u201cThe suspicion in the reading public\u2019s mind will be that one or other of these considerable authors was being patronised; that something extra-literary had entered into the considerations of the panel, that the judges were trying to have their cake and eat it. Had they given it a single one, that would not have been possible in the same way. They could have said, simply: this book is first among equals.\u201d\n\nEishar Brar, editorial director at publisher Knights Of, felt it was \u201cincredibly short-sighted for the prize to be split in the year it\u2019s awarded to the first black woman to receive it\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe judges claim they wanted to acknowledge the importance of both books in their cultural context, but this decision completely ignores the context of Bernardine\u2019s win,\u201d said Brar. \u201cThe split decision is now the overwhelming narrative when the sole focus should be on this historic and long overdue first.\u201d\n\nSana Goyal, digital editor at Wasafiri magazine, mourned how the \u201cjudges\u2019 rule-breaking antics took precedence over what could\u2019ve been a truly record-smashing, history-making, trajectory-altering move for the prize\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe case is less about Atwood being undeserving,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand more about wholly and fully rewarding, validating, and celebrating the first black (British) woman to win the Booker Prize for \u2018fiction at its finest\u2019.\u201d\n\nOthers were happy just to celebrate Evaristo\u2019s win \u2013 including Atwood, who told Evaristo on stage: \u201cI kind of don\u2019t need the attention, so I am very glad that you\u2019re getting some.\u201d\n\nWasafiri\u2019s publishing director Malachi McIntosh said that the magazine \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more excited that [Evaristo] won the Booker\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor years she\u2019s been writing the kind of formally ambitious, panoramic, socially engaged novels that have been the prize\u2019s hallmarks,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s incredible that it\u2019s taken so long for a black British woman \u2013 for a black woman from anywhere \u2013 to win the prize; but on the other hand, I can think of no one else more deserving. Hopefully this makes more readers discover her classics like Lara, The Emperor\u2019s Babe, and Blonde Roots.\u201d\n\nSharmaine Lovegrove, publisher at Dialogue Books, said: \u201cIt was an extraordinary night and the split of the prize shows that it is totally subjective what is considered the \u2018finest fiction\u2019. It was a great night for feminists, and for black women and women making history is always a step towards equality.\n\n\u201cI respect that the judges pushed for what they thought was best. We live in weird times and to be disruptive keeps us on our toes. Atwood was incredible and generous and Evaristo is a winner!\u201d", "description": "Decision to make first black female winner, Bernardine Evaristo, share \u00a350,000 prize with Margaret Atwood causes controversy", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e068e1e5bf612c027129cbbfde700590b928825/0_107_4273_2564/master/4273.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8a1f51790655b4ddb369edf1a66bd649", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
