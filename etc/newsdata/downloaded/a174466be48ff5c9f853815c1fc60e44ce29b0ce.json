They were just flying out.'\n\nLeah, who's agoraphobia keeps her stuck at home, added: 'My dad was so shocked he called his friends.\n\n'He told them, ''oh my god, there's nine, now there's ten,'' and so on until the 13th arrived.\n\n'He was the one supposed to be helping me, but he was just too excited.'\n\nThe birth was not without drama as one of the puppies became trapped in the birth canal by Beau's placenta, which had come loose.\n\nLeah, who did her homework before the delivery, said: 'She was there for 40 minutes. By the time we got her out she wasn't breathing or moving.\n\nBeau is a Crufts champion descendant and was just two shy of what is thought to be the record, set by a black Labrador who gave birth to 15 puppies in 2014\n\nSome of the labradors from the huge litter. The birth was not without drama as one of the puppies became trapped in the birth canal by Beau's placenta which had come loose\n\nHowever, they managed to revive her and all the puppies are now thriving, with all but two set to be sold to new families for \u00a3950 each\n\nSeven weeks on, the puppies are all growing increasingly lively and chubby and the Barrett family has given each pup a name to match their distinct personalities\n\n'We were all panicking, we thought we had lost her. It took about ten to 15 minutes to get her breathing.\n\n'I used suction equipment to suck all the fluid out of her lungs. It's a good job I'd done my reading on the subject, or she wouldn't be here now.'\n\nThe family named the plucky pup 'Hope' and she is now one of the biggest in the brood.\n\nSeven weeks on, the puppies are all growing increasingly lively and chubby.\n\nA video shows the pups as they wolf down one of their five meals a day, while their siblings were conked out on the family's living room floor.\n\nThe Barrett family has given each pup a name to match their distinct personalities.\n\nThe boys are called Stormy, Ziggy, Ninja, Danny Dyer, Neon, Stevie and Bear, and the girls - Hope, Violet, Penelope, Paloma Faith, Penelope and Baby Pink.\n\nLeah, who delivered the puppies, said she did not sleep for weeks because she would wake up in the middle of the night to feed the runts of the litter.

They'd probably have died otherwise.\n\n'My mum has been sleeping in the living room for nearly two months now. She's still worried about them.'\n\nDespite the difficulties, Leah said delivering the pups was the 'most beautiful' thing she had ever done.\n\nShe added: 'I will never forget it. It was the first and last litter we've ever delivered. Beau is our baby, so for her to have babies is so special.'\n\nThe mother-of-13 is now taking some well-earned rest as her litter has now been weaned off her milk.\n\nThe Barretts are now selling all but two of the Kennel Club registered pups at \u00a3950 each, meaning the family will pocket than \u00a310,000 for their efforts\n\nLeah plans to train 'beautiful' Hope, who was trapped in the birth canal, into a show dog and hopes it will help her overcome her own anxiety which has kept her house-bound for months\n\nFeeding the pack is a full time job for Leah and her family, who get through nearly 200 sachets of dog food a day.\n\nThe dogs have a fine lineage including a Crufts winner and several field trial champions, who were experts in retrieving game on shoots.\n\nThe Barretts are now selling all but two of the Kennel Club registered pups at \u00a3950 each, meaning the family will pocket than \u00a310,000 for their efforts.\n\nThey have decided to keep 'mummy's boy' Bear and Hope, who has become one of the chubbiest pups after being revived at birth.\n\nLeah plans to train 'beautiful' Hope into a show dog and hopes it will help her overcome her anxiety which has kept her house-bound for months.\n\nShe said: 'At the moment I only leave home for hospital appointments.\n\n'By taking Hope to competitions it will give me a reason to get out of the house more. It would improve my quality of life massively.'\n\nLeah's father Nick, a builder, plans to raise Bear to be a gun dog to replace mum Beau on shoots.", "description": "Beau, who lives with her owners in Allhallows, Kent was just two shy of what is thought to be the largest litter record, set by a black Labrador who gave birth to 15 puppies in 2014.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/12/20243428-0-image-a-34_1572180145013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
