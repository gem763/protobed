The final months of the year\u2019s schedule are being figured out and pieced together.\n\nThere are just eight events remaining in 2019. While some fighters are being booked, others are struggling to find opponents. Some fighters have been cut, while others signed.\n\nWithout further ado, here are some rumblings I\u2019ve heard as of late:\n\nTony Ferguson\u2019s timetable\n\nAt Dominance MMA media day last Tuesday, Khabib Nurmagomedov\u2019s manager, Ali Abdelaziz, revealed that his client is looking to defend his title against Tony Ferguson in either March or April.\n\nFrom what I\u2019m being told, that\u2019s pretty much in line with Ferguson\u2019s timeline. Prior to Abdelaziz\u2019s statement, a person with knowledge of the situation told me \u201cEl Cucuy\u201d was zoning in on a preferred timetable of a February or March title shot against the Russian champion.\n\nWill the fifth time be the charm for this fight to actually happen? We can only hope.\n\nRob Font can\u2019t find a dance partner\n\nPoor Rob Font.\n\nOne of the faces of New England MMA, the ranked bantamweight seemed like a shoe-in for this weekend\u2019s UFC on ESPN 6 card in Boston.\n\nThere was just one problem \u2013 well, a few of them. After initial talk of a potential rebooking with Cody Stamann, Font was placed in a matchup against Jimmie Rivera. However, that contest fell through, too.\n\nSo a completely healthy hometown contender will have to watch the action in \u201cBeantown\u201d from outside the cage Friday night. This scenario comes on the heels of multiple opponent pullouts at UFC Greenville in June, which resulted in a healthy Font being scrapped from the card just hours before weigh-ins.\n\nHe\u2019s hoping to get back in action by the end of the year \u2013 if he can find an opponent, that is.\n\nA UFC flyweight tournament?\n\nRemember how the UFC flyweight division went away for a little bit and then miraculously came back? Around that time, the promotion began considering a tournament style format to determine the next champion, according to a source.\n\nIn an interview with TSN last week, UFC flyweight Tim Elliott mentioned he, too, had heard the promotion was interested in a potential tournament. I\u2019m not sure if this is something still being considered, but if not then maybe it\u2019ll be reconsidered in the future.\n\nIan Heinisch off of UFC Singapore\n\nEarlier this month, MMA Junkie\u2019s own Mike Bohn and Farah Hannoun reported that a fight between Brad Tavares and Edmen Shahbazyan was set for UFC 244 on Nov. 2 in New York. Prior to the booking, both men had different opponents.\n\nShahbazyan\u2019s opponent, Krzysztof Jotko, announced through social media he had to undergo surgery, so that\u2019s why he\u2019s out.\n\nBut what happened to Brad Tavares\u2019 UFC Singapore opponent, Ian Heinisch? Nothing, I\u2019m told.\n\nHe\u2019s healthy, but Tavares\u2019 withdrawal means Heinisch will no longer be fighting Oct. 26.\n\nFrom Holland to Giles to Di Chirico\n\nWhen Kevin Holland stepped in to replace an injured Eric Spicely at UFC on ESPN 6, it left a void for adjacent Antonio Arroyo on the Nov. 16 UFC Sao Paulo card.\n\nAccording to a report days later, Arroyo would face off with Trevin Giles. The bout was indeed in the works, but according to a source, the contest was never finalized. With Giles out, Italy\u2019s Alessio Di Chirico has stepped in.\n\nUFC releases\n\nMMA Junkie has confirmed with the following fighters or their teams that they have parted ways with the UFC:\n\nTeam Alpha Male\u2019s wrestling coach\n\nLast Saturday night, UFC president Dana White scouted a local show in Hawaii for a taping of his \u201cDana White: Lookin\u2019 for a Fight\u201d series. In the main event, Team Alpha Male wrestling coach Alex Munoz (6-0) defeated fellow top-tier lightweight prospect Troy Lamson (12-3) by unanimous decision.\n\nPer social media posts and stories from Munoz\u2019s teammates and friends (some of which have been deleted), it sounds like Munoz\u2019s performance did enough to earn himself a UFC deal.\n\nFrom one backyard to another\n\nThe UFC on ESPN 6 card in Boston took a major hit a few weeks back, when the then co-main event between Zabit Magomedsharipov and Calvin Kattar fell off the card.\n\nThe bout was quickly scheduled for UFC on ESPN+ 21, which takes place just three weeks later. Magomedsharipov\u2019s given reason was largely unknown. According to multiple sources, the Russian fighter suffered an infection, which left him unable to compete in Boston.\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 21 takes place Saturday, Nov. 9 in Moscow, Russia.
