In his press conference, Trump presented the gory details of the mission, with characteristic bombast and misplaced mirth \u2013 as if it were a Hollywood spectacle worthy of an Oscar. This was in stark contrast to President Barack Obama\u2019s announcement of Osama bin Laden\u2019s end, which somberly reflected upon the global challenge of terrorism and why this moment was significant for the US and the world. But then, in today\u2019s times, crass trumps class.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard is getting pilloried for saying and sticking to the point that the US needs to get out of and not engage again in regime-change wars. Gabbard is a politician today; she once served in the forces. Examining her stance calls for nuance, but that is an art lost upon the public culture in America today.\n\nGabbard\u2019s argument calls pause for this: Should the US mind its own business or save the world? We have seen the devastating consequences of the US fostering democracy globally throughout recent history \u2013 be it in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, or Syria. American exceptionalism is about self-interest and there is no sugar-coating that fact. Self-interest is the logic and leading ideal of global diplomacy. America is not unique in pursuing it and so we must not bash it alone. The difference, however, lies in the fact that the US has destroyed nations through its military misadventures in the name of help and aid. All the while, it has failed the welfare of its own troops and their families. A recent Time magazine headline reads thus: America\u2019s Forever War \u2013 Gregory Grammer, 17, is one of thousands of training for a war that started before he was born. I need say no more.\n\nSure, these countries in conflict were going to pot on their own. American troops have helped save thousands of civilians lives in these war zones. Evidence does not, however, prove that US intervention has led to the well-intentioned goal of restoring the rule of law and peace for the people of these destroyed regions. Or enabling democratic structures of governance, the reason the United States intervened here.\n\nMeanwhile, even as it engages in incursions across the world, the US has abandoned allies or refused to intervene in other places that were crying for help. Cases in point are the recent American abdication of northern Syria and its earlier hands-off approach in Egypt. Commitment to democracy cannot be a dip-in-dip-out-as-you-please affair. Not if you have appointed yourself to be the leader of the free world.\n\nWhich brings me to this. Democracy is an ever-changing concept. When women, half our population, could not vote in the free world, it was still called a \u2018democracy\u2019. It is called a \u2018democracy\u2019 in countries like my homeland India, where though deemed equal by a fine Constitution, multitudes are denied their citizen rights because of their caste, gender, or socio-economic class status. Caste in India is similar to race in the U.S. It is an architecture of oppression devised and kept alive by the privileged. The spirit of the Constitution\u2019s letter in both countries is not translated into everyday life for the people it was supposedly written and enshrined for.\n\nWhatever our political systems, we are bound by common humanity. And that asks of us to be engaged, vigilant, and expressive citizens \u2013 domestically and globally. Speaking truth to power is not the job of the free press alone. It is incumbent upon all of us. Whether it is via exercising the ballot or writing a blogpost, this is our privilege of citizenship and duty of social contract that we are called upon to abide by. It starts by asking ourselves, and then our governments, what and who are we fighting for?", "description": "On Sunday, October 27, we were informed by US President Donald Trump that the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed in a US special operation.
