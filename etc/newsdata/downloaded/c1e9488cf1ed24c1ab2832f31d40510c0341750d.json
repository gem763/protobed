The Caon Design Office founder, whose latest project is to refit the interior of Qantas\u2019 A380, speaks with AFR Magazine for its regular What I Am Reading column.\n\nDo you read books for work?\n\nYes. Something will lead me to a particular architect, designer or artist and then I will search for books about them. I really like the big coffee table design books which give an overview of someone\u2019s career as well as a biographical element.\n\nDavid Caon: \"I am interested in what happens when society breaks down or tries to overregulate itself and a hero rises up to resist.\"\n\nAt the moment I am reading Tom Sachs: Prada Book, an essay collection by Germano Celant and Malcolm Gladwell about Tom Sachs, the American sculptor. I am also reading The Curves of Time, the memoir of Oscar Niemeyer, the Brazilian architect, who is one of my favourite architects.\n\nHe talks about his childhood and what he used to do with his friends; it shows he was just a regular guy who enjoyed life \u2013 he wasn\u2019t some tortured genius. People can write quite elaborately about their work, but I much prefer hearing about the mundanity of their life because then you can make a connection.\n\nWho are some of your favourite fiction writers?\n\nHaruki Murakami and Kurt Vonnegut. I\u2019ve also been reading a bit of Aldous Huxley. Murakami\u2019s Norwegian Wood is his breakout. With Murakami you never get closure.\n\nHe just leaves shit hanging out there and moves on. The Vonnegut books I remember best are Cat\u2019s Cradle and Slaughterhouse Five. I also loved The Catcher in the Rye and Catch-22. They\u2019re classics for a reason.\n\nWhy do you like dystopian fiction?\n\nI love stories of the apocalypse and about upside-down societies, like [George Orwell\u2019s] 1984. I am interested in what happens when society breaks down or tries to overregulate itself and a hero rises up to resist. I am talking about books from the \u201930s, \u201940s and \u201950s; it\u2019s interesting how we are still dealing today with many of the issues they were writing about.", "description": "At work, the creative mind behind the Qantas Dreamliner cabin refit has his head in the clouds.
