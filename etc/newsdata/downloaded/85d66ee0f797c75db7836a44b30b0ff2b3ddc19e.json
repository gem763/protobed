She is mother to ten-month-old Evie.\n\nI remember becoming aware of climate change at school and thinking: \u2018That\u2019s not right.\u2019 I also met my husband Michael there and we ended up doing the same Master\u2019s course in environmental technology at Imperial College London, so we stayed friends.\n\nIt was here that we learned that 30 per cent to 40 per cent of food is wasted every year, globally.\n\nIlana Taub, 33, (pictured) co-founded sustainable snacks company Snact, after becoming driven to do something about food waste across the globe\n\nThe scale is shocking \u2014 you can\u2019t really grasp what it looks like. At a time when we\u2019re facing the challenge of feeding growing populations, it seems insane.\n\nAfter graduating in 2011, we wondered what we could do about it. But the solution wasn\u2019t clear. So I got a job in sustainability at The Institute of Chartered Accountants, and Michael moved to Denmark to work with wind turbines.\n\nYet he would often come back here for work. We would meet up to brainstorm business ideas and we visited wholesale markets to see how much produce was wasted.\n\nAnything misshapen or \u2018ugly\u2019 didn\u2019t make it to market. Then, huge amounts were thrown out once they passed their best-before dates \u2014 this included the 1.6 billion UK apples that are thrown out each year.\n\nThen, in May 2013, a friend told us about an ancient Middle Eastern practice of preserving fruit, by blending and dehydrating it.\n\nThis was our lightbulb moment. I met Michael at the Southbank Centre and we said: \u2018Let\u2019s go for it!\u2019 We quit our jobs and began to experiment with recipes for our own snacks, made with fruit that was \u2018unsaleable\u2019 but still usable.\n\nFruit jerky, \u00a33.99, snact.co.uk\n\nIn autumn 2013, we launched Snact, with support from an online campaign with Crowdfunder. Each bag of fruit jerky is made using one apple plus other fruit, which would have been thrown away. It\u2019s all produced in the UK and the packaging is compostable.\n\nAt first, we were selling only at London markets, but it was such a hit, we were soon stocked in small shops.\n\nIn 2016, Michael and I got married and today, we have a range of three flavours, which are sold in Planet Organic, Ocado and on Amazon.\n\nI never thought I would end up working with my partner, but it\u2019s been absolutely incredible. I think more people should do it!\n\nYou could get crowdfunding support and funding to start your own business at natwestbackherbusiness.co.uk", "description": "Ilana Taub, 33, is the co-founder of sustainable snacks company Snact.
