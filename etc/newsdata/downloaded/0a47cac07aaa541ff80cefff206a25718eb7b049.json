The city\u2019s benchmark Hang Seng Index rose more than 4% Wednesday afternoon, on pace for its biggest one-day gain since November.\n\nWrite to Natasha Khan at natasha.khan@wsj.com", "description": "In a major concession to protesters, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam plans to withdraw the China extradition bill that sparked months of at times violent street demonstrations.", "authors": ["Natasha Khan", "Neil Western", "Natasha.Khan Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103728/social"}
