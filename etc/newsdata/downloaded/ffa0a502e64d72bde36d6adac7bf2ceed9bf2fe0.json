Take a look around the World at our competitors. Germany and others are actually GETTING PAID to borrow money. Fed was way too fast to raise, and way too slow to cut! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 24, 2019\n\nWith the 2020 presidential race closing in, that means Trump\u2019s biggest argument for reelection beyond his base \u2014 the strength of the economy \u2014 could be undercut by the reality that growth will, at best, be plugging along at the same pace as it was under his political nemesis, former President Barack Obama.\n\nThat dynamic could simply mean more angry tweets from the president, but he could escalate the standoff by reviving his threat to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\n\u201cThe way to get the Fed\u2019s attention again means threatening to fire Powell, but he seems to have backed off of that,\u201d said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really get any pickup from Republicans on the Hill.\u201d\n\nThat could change if the economy begins to dramatically slow, particularly given Congress\u2019s inability to enact new policy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the push for the economy comes from stepping back from some of these trade disputes,\u201d Binder said. \u201cI\u2019m hard-pressed to see Republicans, given a divided Congress, doing any major stimulus, especially as the deficit gets over $1 trillion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way to do it might be through infrastructure, but no one seems to think that\u2019s a serious possibility,\u201d she added.\n\nAs the Fed aims to continue its policy of ignoring the president\u2019s broadsides, the central bank faces a complicated picture. Still healthy consumer spending and a 50-year-low unemployment rate suggest the economy isn\u2019t in dire need of intervention.\n\nIndeed, market participants on Tuesday afternoon were nearly unanimous in predicting the Fed will lower rates on Wednesday \u2014 and almost 80 percent are then expecting the central bank to hold off on another cut in December, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1c/b4/649a34a64b52ae98a04f435ecf37/191029-federal-reserve-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
