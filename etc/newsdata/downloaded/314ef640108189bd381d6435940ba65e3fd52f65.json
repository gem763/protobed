On Thursday, The Washington Post reported that Ukraine is at the center of the complaint, according to two former US officials.\n\nCuomo had Giuliani on the show to comment on the whistleblower complaint and also pointed out that Congress is looking into Giuliani's communications with Ukraine for alleged political reasons.\n\n\"One is whether Ukrainian officials took steps during the 2016 election to damage Mr. Trump's campaign,\" The New York Times, which broke the news that Giuliani wanted to pressure Ukraine, wrote in August. \"The other is whether there was anything improper about the overlap between former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s diplomatic efforts in Ukraine and his son's role with a gas company there.\"\n\nGiuliani had planned to take a trip to Ukraine in May (that never happened) to talk to the incoming Ukrainian president about investigations into Hunter Biden and the 2016 election. The prosecutor who had been looking into the two issues was dismissed over allegations of corruption.\n\nThe former vice president had pressured Ukraine into firing the prosecutor, however, PolitiFact did not find evidence that it was related to his son; there was a broader international push for his ouster.\n\nRead more: A major whistleblower complaint at the US's top spy agency involves a Trump phone call with a 'promise' to a foreign leader\n\nThree House committees are looking into whether Trump and Giuliani were trying \"to pressure the government of Ukraine to assist the President's reelection campaign\" by investigating Trump's political rivals \u2014 namely Biden and his family.\n\nThe CNN interview started off on the wrong foot after Giuliani called Cuomo's summation of the situation \"totally erroneous.\"\n\nCuomo attempted to interrupt Giuliani to clarify details on whether or not the defense lawyer asked Ukraine to look into Biden, a detail on which Giuliani went back and forth.\n\n\"Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?\" Cuomo initially asked when the two were not talking over one another, to which Giuliani replied, \"No, I didn't.\"\n\nA few moments later, Giuliani said he asked Ukraine to get to the bottom of the case that was dismissed by Petro O. Poroshenko involving Hunter.\n\n\"So you did ask Ukraine to investigate Biden,\" Cuomo said.\n\n\"Of course I did,\" Giuliani responded.\n\nThe intensity came to a breaking point as the interview wrapped up.\n\n\"You've been distracting from the truth for a year and a half, and I hope you enjoy it because this president got the benefit of something you built up for decades \u2014 your credibility,\" Cuomo said, \"and you put it on the line for him. Good choice.\"\n\n\"I put it on the line for him 1,000%, and I think your network is a horror to this country,\" Giuliani replied, adding that he can back up his claims with documents.\n\nCuomo asked Giuliani to give him the documents, to which Giuliani replied, \"Why would I give the enemy the documents?\"\n\nThe lawyer went on to call CNN a \"creature of the Democratic National Committee,\" told Cuomo that he should be embarrassed.\n\n\"Have a good night,\" Cuomo said as he ended the interview.\n\n\"You shouldn't have a good night because what you're doing is bad for the country,\" Giuliani said.\n\nFollowing the interview Giuliani tweeted, \"A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.\"\n\nWatch clips of the interview below:", "description": "Trump is at the center of a whistleblower complaint after The Washington Post reported that he made a \"promise\" to an unnamed Ukrainian leader.", "authors": ["Lauren Frias"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d84317c2e22af42354d43f2-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
