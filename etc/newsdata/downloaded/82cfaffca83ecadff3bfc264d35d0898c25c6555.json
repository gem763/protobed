The formal demand made by Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, earlier this week set up what is likely to be a vicious court battle between Team Trump and his Democratic antagonists on Capitol Hill.\n\nTrump retained the law firm Consovoy McCarthy Park PLLC to represent him with regard to congressional requests for his tax returns. \u201cOur firm welcomes the opportunity to represent President Trump in his capacity as a taxpayer,\u201d one of Trump\u2019s personal attorneys, William Consovoy, who is also representing the president in a separate emoluments case, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cThe requests for his private tax information are not consistent with governing law, do not advance any proper legislative purpose, and threaten to interfere with the ordinary conduct of audits. We are confident that this misguided attempt to politicize the administration of the tax laws will not succeed.\u201d\n\nNeal has also asked for returns for the president\u2019s trust and seven Trump business entities. He has contended Congress has the authority to review the president\u2019s returns under existing tax law.\n\nIn a brief interview with The Daily Beast on Friday afternoon, Jay Sekulow, a Trump lawyer who defended him during Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, said he will be \u201coverseeing\u201d this and other \u201crelated matters\u201d but that Consovoy will be taking the lead. Sekulow also said that it was unclear at this time what role the White House Counsel\u2019s office will play in this going forward, given that the congressional request includes years during which Trump was already in office.\n\nConsovoy on Friday also wrote a letter to Treasury Department General Counsel Brent McIntosh, questioning \u201cwhy Chairman Neal cannot legally request\u2014and the IRS cannot legally divulge\u2014this information\u201d regarding the president or his business empire.\n\nThe IRS is a bureau of the Treasury Department, which is headed by Trump friend Steve Mnuchin, who is also cc\u2019d on Consovoy\u2019s four-page letter, which was reviewed by The Daily Beast.\n\nTrump has for years maintained that he\u2019s never voluntarily given up his tax returns because he is allegedly under audit by the IRS. However, no law prohibits him from releasing the long-sought-after tax returns, even if there\u2019s an audit.\n\nWhen asked in the Oval Office on Thursday if he will release his tax returns\u2014as he had promised to do during the 2016 presidential campaign but then never did\u2014President Trump told reporters that lawmakers will \u201cspeak to my lawyers; they\u2019ll speak to the attorney general.\u201d On Friday, the president told reporters at the White House, \u201cHey, I\u2019m under audit,\u201d adding that the law is \u201c100 percent on my side.\u201d", "description": "His new law firm argues the president has a right to keep his tax returns private.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2495,w_4436,x_0,y_378/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1554498419/GettyImages-1140397312_qqj0rv", "published_at": "2019-04-05"}
