Trump replayed some of his greatest hits through 68 minutes of wide-ranging remarks alternating between his prepared teleprompter lines and his own free-flowing stream of jabs. He slammed \u201csleepy\u201d Joe Biden and \u201ccrazy\u201d Bernie Sanders, poked fun at the Green New Deal, ripped the \u201cfake news\u201d media and lamented that energy-saving light bulbs make him \u201clook orange.\u201d\n\nTrump also complained that he \u201chit Pocahontas way too early,\u201d a reference to Elizabeth Warren\u2019s recent rise in the polls. \u201cI thought she was gone. She has emerged from the ashes and she could beat Sleepy Joe!\u201c Trump said.\n\nTrump was scheduled to speak an hour earlier than he did \u2014 a delay that allowed him to start just as Democratic presidential candidates were taking the stage in Houston.\n\nTrump ticked off a list of GOP accomplishments, from tax cuts to conservative judges, and hailed a pair of special election victories in North Carolina. He promised to unveil a middle-income tax cut next year, despite no real chance of passing it through a Democratic-controlled House. The president also vowed to pass his own health care legislation should the GOP win back the House, something he failed to do in his first year in office when Republicans controlled the House.\n\n\u201cThe best is yet to come,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWhile Trump made no mention of what he plans to do on gun control following a bloody summer of shootings, he reiterated support for the right to bear arms.\n\n\u201cDemocrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding citizens,\u201c Trump said to a standing ovation. \u201cRepublicans will always uphold the fundamental right to keep and bear arms.\u201d\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

As Trump entered the ballroom, he was greeted by a standing ovation and chants of \u201cfour more years.\u201d\n\nTrump also cracked some jokes \u2014 quipping that he likes the idea of cowboy hats because he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about his \u201chair blowing in the wind\u201c \u2014 and repeatedly called out individuals from the crowd. The most quizzical line of the night, though, came after he said the Green New Deal would result in \u201cno more cows, no more planes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess no more planes, right? Because Kevin is just like a cow, he\u2019s just smaller,\u201d he said, referring to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). \u201cI had to pick someone for that one Kevin and I just looked at that beautiful, beautiful face of yours.\u201d\n\nAt times, it felt like a campaign rally, with Trump even closing out his speech with his signature campaign song, \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe brought the diesel tonight. He was very jovial as he addressed the members of the Republican conference,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump\u2019s top allies on Capitol Hill. \u201cBut more importantly, he outlined why the 2020 election is so important.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s visit to Baltimore \u2014 his first since being elected president \u2014 comes weeks after he called Maryland\u2019s largest city a \u201crat and rodent infested mess\u201d where \u201cno human being would want to live.\u201d He also tore into Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who represents the city of Baltimore and chairs the House Oversight Committee \u2014 one of the six panels investigating Trump.\n\nAs he rolled up to the city, however, Trump just had two words to say: \u201cHello Baltimore!\u201d he tweeted, alongside a picture of the streets.\n\nTrump\u2019s summer Twitter attacks on Charm City came long after congressional Republicans chose the site for their annual retreat. But over six weeks later, the divisive rhetoric was still creating headaches for GOP leaders, who were forced to defend the president\u2019s remarks just hours before Trump\u2019s speech on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI think the president coming here symbolizes that, yes, he cares about Baltimore, he cares about the people that live in Baltimore, and he does not accept that you have to stay in poverty,\u201d McCarthy told reporters at a press conference.\n\nTrump\u2019s motorcade was greeted by hundreds of protesters, as well as a 14-foot inflatable rat with a Trump-like head and a cell phone in its paws with a sticker \u201cFight Fascism, Stop Trump.\u201d Hundreds of onlookers, mostly snapping photos, also lined the streets, though one stuck up her middle finger as the motorcade passed by. Closer to the hotel, protesters were heard booing and seen holding up signs that said \u201cDump Trump Ditch Mitch\u201d and \u201cImpeach Trump.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are slated to address the Republican conference on Friday.\n\nThe annual retreat \u2014 the GOP\u2019s first since being relegated to the minority \u2014 comes fresh off a critical special election win in North Carolina. Trump and the GOP had gone all out for Republican Dan Bishop, who eked out a win over Democrat Dan McCready in a district the president carried by 12 points.\n\nThe narrow victory in a GOP stronghold, however, represents a worrisome trend for House Republicans as they gear up to fight for control of the House next year. Yet here in Baltimore on Thursday, Republicans were eager to paper over their problems, hailing Bishop\u2018s win and heaping praise on Trump for the victory. GOP leaders even paraded Bishop out for their weekly press conference, even before he has been officially sworn in as a member.\n\n\u201cWinning is a good thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Trump said.", "description": "At a House GOP retreat, the president delivered Republicans the experience of a campaign rally with wide-ranging jabs touching on plastic straws, light bulbs, cows and windmills.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona", "Anita Kumar"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/59/cc/74ff54c74bba978ab5a0e6c4f1ba/19912-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
