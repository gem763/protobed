Through two games, the Redskins have just two sacks and haven\u2019t generated consistent enough pressure.\n\nMeanwhile in Green Bay, a former Redskins pass rusher is thriving.\n\nLinebacker Preston Smith has been a revelation for the Packers since signing a four-year, $52 million deal in free agency, recording 4\u00bd sacks in his first three games. The 26-year-old, who spent four seasons with the Redskins, also has an interception and a forced fumble.\n\nThe Redskins opted not to re-sign Smith in the offseason, viewing his price tag as too high. Washington instead drafted pass rusher Montez Sweat, trading back into the first round to grab him.\n\nSweat has had a quiet first two games, though that can partially be attributed to the fact he went against Philadelphia\u2019s Jason Peters and Dallas\u2019 Tyron Smith \u2014 two of the best left tackles in football.\n\nOn Sunday, Smith had three sacks against the Denver Broncos. In Week 2 against the Minnesota Vikings, he picked off former Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins.\n\nPreston Smith was a MONSTER\n\n\n\n\u2022 5 tackles\n\n\u2022 4 solo\n\n\u2022 3 sacks\n\n\n\nDominating the Edge \ud83d\ude24 #PSmith pic.twitter.com/7K7MG0HacG \u2014 IKE Packers (@IKE_Packers) September 22, 2019\n\n\n\nPreston Smith with the INTERCEPTION!! pic.twitter.com/zqbRfTpyOj \u2014 Cream City Central (@CreamCityCtral) September 15, 2019\n\n\n\nWith the Redskins, Smith was an inconsistent pass rusher. The 2015 second-round pick never had more than eight sacks in a season and would go stretches in which he was held in check. For instance, Smith went the first eight weeks in 2018 without a sack and then recorded 3\u00bd in the next three weeks. He then finished the year with four.\n\nBut Smith could produce pressure \u2014 something desperately needed for Washington right now.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
