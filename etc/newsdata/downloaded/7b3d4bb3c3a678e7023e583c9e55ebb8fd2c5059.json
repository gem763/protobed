Photo-Illustration: James Gallagher\n\nThis week, a researcher struggles with what, and whom, she is looking for: 38, single, heterosexual, Baltimore.\n\nDAY ONE\n\n8:44 a.m. Working from home today. I\u2019m a postdoc researcher, and I\u2019m working on a presentation. Browsing Twitter, I see a photo of Bernie Sanders raising a fist amid a crowd of supporters, incidentally in front of a XXX Movie Arcade sign: Videos! Toys! Lotions! I text the photo to Chris \u2014 a financial analyst who lives in D.C. We met 10 years ago in an online philosophy discussion forum. I had a thing for him, but at the time he had a girlfriend and lived on the opposite side of the country. We\u2019ve fooled around a few times in the past.\n\n\u201cAll hail socialism and XXX movies,\u201d Chris texts back. We discuss plans for my visit on Saturday.\n\n11:22 a.m. I also sent the photo to Derek, who responds, \u201cHe is horny just like you!\u201d I met Derek in the park not long after I moved to Baltimore. He was dressed in costume and rehearsing a scene from Much Ado About Nothing: \u201cSuffer love! A good epithet! I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will.\u201d He was playing Benedick, one of my favorite Shakespeare characters, as I told him during their break. Turns out we were neighbors. I began to frequent his puzzle and game nights.\n\nRecently, I ran into him in the park doing dress rehearsal again and stopped to say hi. As I continued on my run, I realized I was attracted to him. It was weird because I\u2019d never thought of him that way before, but suddenly I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him. I told him a couple of days later, and we made out. It was hot. But when I saw him next, he told me he didn\u2019t want to ruin the friendship. I was disappointed. We fucked a couple of times not too long after that, though.\n\n1:24 p.m. Texting with Derek about our status. He says the fucking was fun but doesn\u2019t think we are a good boyfriend-girlfriend match. I don\u2019t understand why. I tell him he\u2019s the only person in my life who I could imagine fucking me as described in a Henry Miller novel. But I don\u2019t want to make him uncomfortable. I know how it can be when someone is attracted to you and you\u2019re not into it.\n\n\u201cWe could do friend fucking,\u201d he says.\n\nI am surprised and excited to hear this. \u201cBut we should be careful,\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe we can discuss more in person.\u201d\n\n4:01 p.m. Derek and I plan to meet for dinner later. Now I\u2019m not really sure what I want. He wants the kind of arrangement where I can text and say, \u201cI\u2019m coming over for game night. Do you want to fuck after?\u201d It seems a little clinical. I was thinking something a bit more spontaneous, passionate.But if he does start wanting me, would I stop wanting him?\n\n6:00 p.m. I meet Derek on the corner and we walk to the caf\u00e9. He offers me a flower plucked from a bush. He does a lot of talking over dinner. He mentions that I date a lot. He doesn\u2019t want to risk the friendship. He wants to have many things laid out and clarified.\n\nI find I don\u2019t have much to say. It seems simple to me. It\u2019s not something I have to think hard about. I\u2019m just doing what feels right.\n\n7:15 p.m. A torrential downpour erupts on the walk home. Derek grabs my hand and we take shelter on someone\u2019s porch. \u201cKind of romantic, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says. We stand there for a few moments, holding hands. I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll kiss me. But he doesn\u2019t, so I kiss him. Then I back up. I want him to kiss me. And he does. No tongue. Just soft kisses on the lips.\n\nI\u2019ve never enjoyed kissing anyone more. I\u2019m in love with him. I\u2019ve been afraid to come out and say it, since it seems he\u2019s not ready for that. Maybe I didn\u2019t know if it was real or fantasy. Will I wake up tomorrow and the infatuation be gone? Who knows. But I love kissing him, and I want to do more of it.\n\nDAY TWO\n\n2:12 p.m. Writing Derek a love letter. Probably a stupid idea, but I\u2019m a romantic. I prepare myself for another broken heart. I text Chris about it, who tells me it will just scare Derek off. \u201cHe gave me a flower, though,\u201d I say. I just want Derek to know the depth of my feelings. He seems to be worried about the fact that I date a lot. Or so he says.\n\n8:44 p.m. Party at Derek\u2019s. I sneak away for a minute to put my letter in his bedroom. I keep my distance from him during the party. I want to give him space. Also, maybe there is something incompatible about the two of us?\n\n12:50 a.m. I say goodbye to Derek and a new friend, Amber, on the sidewalk. Amber and I exchange numbers and discuss hanging out next weekend. She asks to have a word with Derek as I depart.\n\n1:13 a.m. \u201cWas she flirting with you?!?!??\u201d I text Derek on my way home.\n\nDAY THREE\n\n10:20 a.m. Just arrived in D.C. on the bus. I\u2019m going to see the Tintoretto exhibit at the National Gallery of Art and having dinner with Chris after.\n\nDerek replies to last night\u2019s text: \u201cI thought maybe, but it turned out to be a crazy story. I got your letter. Let me process what you have written. It\u2019s a lovely letter. I have been on the move since I got up. And I\u2019m with my family all day.\u201d\n\n11:04 a.m. In the gift shop at the National Gallery. Chris texts, asking what happened with the letter. \u201cHe\u2019s processing it,\u201d I say. \u201cI knew he was an android,\u201d says Chris.\n\n4:25 p.m. I meet Chris. I\u2019m always a little nervous when I see him in person. We know each other well but mostly interact over text, so it\u2019s still a novelty to see him.\n\n10:07 p.m. Walking to the Metro after a pleasant night of dinner and drinks and witty conversation. Chris and I make out a little outside the FBI building, but I don\u2019t feel the same passion I do with Derek. There\u2019s nothing like kissing someone you have a crush on.\n\nDAY FOUR\n\n4:14 p.m. Back in Baltimore. Derek calls while I\u2019m in ceramics class. We plan to meet at my place later.\n\n8:32 p.m. I offer Derek some wine. We talk on the couch. He isn\u2019t there yet with the feelings I expressed in the letter, but he admired the bold move. I\u2019m not his usual type, he says. He likes athletic girls with tattoos, but that could change.\n\n9:02 p.m. After some kissing we move to the bed. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to feel your dick inside me,\u201d I say as he climbs on top of me. I don\u2019t usually talk like that. I haven\u2019t been this turned on in a long time. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he says over and over as he\u2019s fucking me. I love how he squeezes and spanks my ass. I come hard as he takes me from behind. He finishes on my face.\n\nIs it the best sex I\u2019ve ever had?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d be a good boyfriend right now because he is poor. That doesn\u2019t bother me, I say. I tell him Henry Miller had lots of women while he was poor and unsuccessful. \u201cHe must\u2019ve had game,\u201d Derek says.\n\n11:17 p.m. Derek kisses me before he leaves. Mouth slightly open, arms firmly around me. He has a sort of raw masculinity about him, and yet his kisses are soft and sweet. This drives me wild.\n\nDAY FIVE\n\n8:22 a.m. My sex drive is crazy today. I masturbate before biking to work.\n\n9:29 a.m. At a work meeting. Everyone is talking about boring science stuff. Meanwhile, I am reliving my encounter with Derek. I look around the table and imagine what each person is like in bed. Who here is having hot sex?\n\n2:26 p.m. I couldn\u2019t focus at work. Now I\u2019m in bed touching myself and imagining Derek penetrating me. I recite \u201coh yeah\u201d under my breath as I come to a climax.\n\n3:39 p.m. Whatever happens in the future, I\u2019m happy about what happened with Derek. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever experienced better kissing or better sex.\n\nDAY SIX\n\n\n\n8:05 a.m. I\u2019m bored with my research. Sitting in a freezing windowless office under fluorescent lights, banging out analysis code and manuscripts that a few dozen people might read \u2014 is this the path to happiness and success? My office mate and fellow postdoc seems to think so. I\u2019m fulfilling the destiny of my upper-middle-class suburban upbringing. But there\u2019s something sterile about this academic work. I crave more life. I\u2019m a bohemian. I like weird people. I fantasize about becoming an artist, a writer.\n\n8:32 a.m. I send a funny picture to Derek. He says, \u201cWho is that?\u201d I explain, and that\u2019s it. No further response.\n\nI feel ignored and unappreciated. Derek is not in love with me. Maybe I\u2019m not the type he falls for? Maybe he can\u2019t love? Maybe he thinks his aloofness is alluring, but I find it frustrating and boring.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to respond to his nonresponse. I guess I should forget it and move on. But I still want to fuck him.\n\n4:53 p.m. Derek texts an invitation to a puzzle night tomorrow at his house.\n\n5:36 p.m. I send a photo to Derek showing my legs on the lounge chair, poolside. \u201cNice!\u201d he says.\n\n7:43 p.m. I tell Chris I might lose interest in Derek soon. The sex was great, but emotionally it\u2019s not very satisfying. We\u2019ll still be friends, I imagine.\n\nDAY SEVEN\n\n10:00 a.m. At a negotiation-skills workshop today. Probably a lot of bullshit exercises and worksheets.\n\n1:54 p.m. Derek texts.\n\nDerek: How about we do some puzzles tonight \u2026 and then some fucking. Me: Oh wow really? Okay \u2026\n\nMaybe I\u2019m changing my mind about him.\n\nMe: I invited Amber \u2026 maybe you can fuck her and I\u2019ll watch and then you can do me. Derek: Whoa. Me: Now I\u2019m aroused and I\u2019m sitting in this boring negotiation workshop. Derek: You\u2019re a wild girl. I like that.\n\n8:15 p.m. We\u2019re at Derek\u2019s building the puzzle. Amber and I piece together the reflecting pool in Salvador Dal\u00ed\u2019s Metamorphosis of Narcissus. Derek told me she\u2019s been having a hard time with love lately, so I don\u2019t ask her to join us in bed.\n\n10:25 p.m. Derek walks me home. I put on Beethoven\u2019s Ninth. We start to get it on. My cat jumps on the bed, so I distract him with his stuffed cat doll. He likes to \u201ccuddle\u201d with it.\n\n\n\n11:18 p.m. \u201cThat was surreal,\u201d Derek says. \u201cWe were fucking, and the cat was fucking his doll.\u201d It wasn\u2019t as good as last time for me. I couldn\u2019t come for some reason. Derek dresses to go. I\u2019m still naked as I see him out and kiss him good-bye.\n\nGet Sex Diaries delivered every week.
