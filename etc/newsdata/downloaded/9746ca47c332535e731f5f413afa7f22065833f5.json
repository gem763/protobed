She also order the company to reinstate a union employee who had been fired and to compensate him for his lost pay.\n\nThe case was filed in April 2017 by several workers at Tesla Fremont, California facility, as well as the international United Automobile Workers (UAW) union. According to court documents, the workers had raised concerns about safety at Tesla facilities, below-market wages and long working hours.\n\nAccording to a post-hearing brief by lawyers representing Tesla workers and UAW, Tesla had threatened unionizing employees and restricted their right to speak for themselves.\n\n\u201cA company that prides itself as representing the cutting edge for new automotive technology has shown itself, when it comes to labor relations, to be a throwback of the worst sort,\u201d the document said.\n\nAmong the employees\u2019 complaints were accusations that Tesla security guards had repeatedly tried to stop union workers from handing out flyers at the facility, telling them to leave the premises and photographing the workers\u2019 badges.\n\nThe company also banned employees from handing out materials that were not pre-approved by Tesla. After employees began to wear shirts with union insignias to work, the company also instituted a restrictive dress code that prohibited unapproved pants and shirts.\n\nIn the ruling, Tracy also singled out a tweet by the company\u2019s founder and CEO, Elon Musk, from May 20, 2018. Musk had tweeted: \u201cNothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?\u201c\n\nTracy noted that Musk\u2019s tweet was sent out to his 22,700,000 Twitter followers, and that it \u201ccan only be read by a reasonable employee to indicate that if the employees vote to unionize that they would give up stock options.\u201d\n\nCourt documents also sited several instances in which Musk and Gaby Toledano, Tesla\u2019s former chief people officer, discouraged employees from forming a union. Toledano allegedly told the employees \u201cthe majority of the workers at Tesla don\u2019t want a union\u201d and asked why employees would want to pay union dues.\n\nJose Moran, a Tesla production associate, said in a statement through the UAW that he knew he would be a \u201ctarget\u201d after criticizing the company in a 2017 Medium post, \u201cAnd sure enough, I was singled out and interrogated.\u201d He thanked the National Labor Relations Board for taking the case.\n\n\u201cMy co-workers and I will continue to speak up, and continue to work to make Tesla a better and safer company. Today\u2019s action makes clear that we have rights, that we can keep talking about what we\u2019re seeing and experiencing at Tesla,\u201d Moran said,", "description": "Judge Amita Tracy ordered the company to cease and desist a litany of actions", "authors": ["Tara Law"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P2wZJ7xbJ5ozSn84p_pdqA--~B/aD03MzE7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/456498cdcc3a03c1f5115fb0097a7617", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
