The letter cited agency records.\n\nCalifornia has waged numerous policy battles and legal challenges with the Republican president's administration over environmental protection, immigration, housing and the state's right to set stricter standards on carbon emissions from vehicles than federal rules.\n\nMichael Abboud, an EPA spokesman, said there was no abuse of authority. \"California's inability to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act has been an ongoing challenge, and the failure to properly operate and maintain the City's sewage collection and treatment facilities creates public health risks,\" he said.\n\n\"Highlighting that California has the worst air quality in the nation along with other serious environmental problems is not a political issue,\" Abboud added.", "description": "The Trump administration last month accused the State of California of violating clean water laws.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/10/bf95e8999d5b4101913487e56b658a64_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
