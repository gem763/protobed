Aaron Judge, DJ LeMahieu and Gregorius also made outstanding defensive plays for key outs.\n\nGregorius went 4 for 10 with six RBIs in the series and is 23 for 50 with seven homers and 33 RBIs in his last 14 games against Minnesota.\n\nFollowing a 103-win regular season and their first AL East title since 2012, the Yankees will start the AL Championship Series on Saturday, either at Houston or at home against Tampa Bay.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Max Scherzer\u2019s season-saving, seven-inning pitching performance and Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s three-run homer lifted the wild-card Washington Nationals to a 6-1 victory over the league-best Los Angeles Dodgers to force a deciding Game 5 in their NL Division Series.\n\nScowling and muttering to himself in his third appearance of this postseason, Scherzer allowed one run and four hits while striking out nine. Most importantly for Washington, he and the Nats prevented LA from closing out the NLDS after taking a 2-1 lead into Game 4.\n\nGame 5 will be Wednesday in Los Angeles, with Stephen Strasburg set to start for the Nationals against Walker Buehler.\n\nThe 35-year-old Zimmerman showed what he still can do at the plate by taking a 97 mph pitch, the second thrown by reliever Pedro B\u00e1ez, and turning it into a high-arching parabola that descended onto the green batter\u2019s eye in straightaway center field for a three-run shot that made it 5-1.\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) - Yadier Molina pushed the St. Louis Cardinals to a deciding Game 5 of the NL Division Series, poking a tying single in the eighth inning and lifting a sacrifice fly in the 10th to beat the Atlanta Braves 5-4.\n\nMolina slung his bat far into the outfield after his winner, and the crowd at Busch Stadium roared with the longtime heart of the franchise.\n\nGame 5 will be Wednesday back in Atlanta. The Cardinals will have ace Jack Flaherty on the mound, and the Braves will go with Mike Foltynewicz.\n\nKolten Wong led off the St. Louis 10th with a ground-rule double against Julio Teheran. After Paul Goldschmidt was intentionally walked, Wong advanced on Marcell Ozuna\u2019s forceout and easily scampered home on Molina\u2019s fly to the front of the warning track in left field. Wong threw his hands in the air as he ran toward the plate. Molina rounded first base with his bat in hand, then flung it away as the celebration erupted. The 37-year-old catcher discarded his batting helmet as the rest of the Cardinals poured onto the field.\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) - Kevin Kiermaier hit a go-ahead, three-run homer as Tampa Bay teed off on Zack Greinke, and the Rays backed another clutch playoff pitching performance by Charlie Morton to beat the Houston Astros 10-3 and avoid a three-game sweep in the AL Division Series.\n\nFacing the team he helped win the World Series two years ago, Morton allowed one run and three hits while striking out nine over five innings. The 35-year-old Morton is 4-0 with an 0.95 ERA in four career elimination starts, including last week\u2019s wild-card win at Oakland.\n\nAstros manager AJ Hinch announced after the game that Houston will start Justin Verlander on three days of rest in Game 4 in the best-of-five matchup at Tropicana Field on Tuesday. Tampa Bay will use Diego Castillo as an opener.\n\nKiermaier got the wild-card Rays going with his shot the second inning. Ji-Man Choi and Brandon Lowe added solo shots off Greinke, who has never won in Tampa Bay, and Willy Adames added a solo blast against Wade Miley in the sixth.\n\nFOOTBALL\n\nASHBURN, Va. (AP) - Owner Dan Snyder and President Bruce Allen summoned coach Jay Gruden to the Washington Redskins\u2019 facility before dawn to tell him he was being fired.\n\nNow comes a longer conversation about the status of the floundering franchise that has won just two playoff games in Snyder\u2019s two decades of ownership and zero during Allen\u2019s tenure. Gruden is out after an 0-5 start to his sixth season and is the latest in a long line of Redskins coaches to take the fall for significant organizational shortcomings.\n\nThe Redskins haven\u2019t won much lately, going 35-49-1 overall under Gruden with one playoff appearance in the 2015 season. A popular coach among players and a smart offensive mind, Gruden struggled in preparing his teams: Washington went 1-5 in season openers and lost a win-and-get-in game in Week 17 in 2016 against the New York Giants, who had nothing to play for.\n\nDespite never before being a head coach in the NFL, and despite never winning more than nine games in a season, Gruden managed to stick around longer than anyone else who\u2019s held that job during Snyder\u2019s unsuccessful stint as owner.\n\nNone of the six coaches hired since Snyder bought the team has a winning record, including Hall of Famer Joe Gibbs and two-time Super Bowl champion Mike Shanahan. Offensive line coach Bill Callahan becomes the seventh after he was selected to replace Gruden on an interim basis.\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) - Matt Breida ran 83 yards for a touchdown on San Francisco\u2019s first play from scrimmage, Baker Mayfield was harassed into his worst game as a pro, and the 49ers stayed unbeaten for their best start in nearly 30 years, beating the Cleveland Browns 31-3.\n\nTevin Coleman added a 19-yard score as part of a dominant ground game on a day when quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo passed for 181 yards and kicker Robbie Gould missed a pair of field goal attempts and had a third try blocked.\n\nSan Francisco (4-0) joined the 5-0 New England Patriots as the only remaining undefeated teams in the NFL. It\u2019s the first time the 49ers have won their first four games since 1990.\n\nThe Browns (2-3) are headed the opposite direction after losing two of three, with fresh concerns about their young quarterback, who had a horrible game. The No. 1 overall pick last year, Mayfiaeld completed 8 of 22 passes for a career-low 100 yards, had a 13.4 passer rating, threw two interceptions, fumbled twice and was sacked four times before being pulled in the fourth quarter.\n\nNBA\n\nBEIJING (AP) - The NBA put out one statement reacting to Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet in support of the Hong Kong protest movement.\n\nDepending on which language it was read in, the league\u2019s words had very different meaning.\n\nA politically charged disagreement over Morey\u2019s tweet that showed support for Hong Kong anti-government protesters got an additional wrinkle when the NBA posted a statement Monday on Weibo - a Twitter-like microblogging site used in China - saying the league was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by what it called an \u201cinappropriate\u201d comment. The same post said the NBA\u2019s stance was that Morey\u2019s view \u201cseverely hurt the feelings of Chinese fans.\u201d\n\nThing is, the league never actually said those words.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "BASEBALL", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
