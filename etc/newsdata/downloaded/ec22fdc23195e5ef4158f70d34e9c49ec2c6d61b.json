Photo: Courtesy of Apple\n\nYou may know Apple\u2019s forthcoming streaming service as the place that will bring you Reese Witherspoon wearing a wig and shouting about journalism. But what\u2019s definitely more important about the new streamer is that it\u2019s making the horny Emily Dickinson show Dickinson (that\u2019s the full title, as far as we\u2019re concerned). Dickinson is about Hailee Steinfeld playing a young, twerking version of the great American poet, who probed the mysteries of life, death, and whether or not she could deploy another dash somewhere in her poetry \u2014 generally, she went with yes. In a remarkable literal interpretation of her work, Dickinson has cast Wiz Khalifa to play Death.\n\nThe Grammy nominee kindly stopped to pose with Steinfeld in the photo above, sent out by Apple, which noted in a release that he\u2019ll act as Emily\u2019s \u201cmuse\u201d in multiple episodes of the first season (Apple\u2019s release delightfully adds, \u201cAs a reminder, death was a recurring theme in Emily Dickinson\u2019s poems,\u201d in case you didn\u2019t read that one poem in middle school). \u201cIt was a true gift to be able to cast Wiz in this series,\u201d creator and showrunner Alena Smith said in a statement. \u201cWe had a creative meeting of the minds in approaching the character, and his playful spirit fit in perfectly with the mischievous tone of the show.\u201d So \u2026 which recording artist will be dressing up in a bunch of feathers to play Hope?", "description": "Wiz Khalifa is playing the embodiment of death in Apple TV+\u2019s horny Emily Dickinson series \u201cDickinson.\u201d", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/13/13-wiz-khalifa-dickinson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
