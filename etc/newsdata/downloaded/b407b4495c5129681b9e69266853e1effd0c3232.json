That\u2019s certainly true at the elite level, where, as I noted earlier this year, centrist antipathy to Sanders is accompanied by centrist interest in Warren:\n\n[F]or all her populism and class-warfare rhetoric, Warren is the representative of a sharp-edged but familiar Democratic policy tradition that seeks to save capitalism from its excesses and restore economic competition, rather than treating it as dangerous or irrelevant. That, not fear of Bernie, is likely the reason for all the comparisons centrists make of her to Sanders; they share many of the same policy positions but arguably a very different perspective \u2026\n\nBeyond ideology, Warren is, after all, a reasonably conventional Democrat who endorsed Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, in 2016. Economic issues aside, her foreign-policy thinking reflects a dovish Democratic tradition instead of the actively leftist, Henry Wallace\u2013progressive tradition that clearly inspires Sanders, who has stood outside the Democratic Party his entire career.\n\nThere\u2019s now evidence that Warren\u2019s growing acceptability is spreading to actual Democratic voters. Morning Consult reports today that she is now the top \u201csecond-choice\u201d candidate in the field (she\u2019s third in first preferences). She is the second-choice favorite among supporters of both fourth-place Kamala Harris and fifth-place Pete Buttigieg and has basically caught up with Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders as the top second-choice candidate for each other\u2019s voters. Looking at another optic in the Morning Consult data, Warren\u2019s favorability/unfavorability ratings (64/15) are pretty much as good as those of Sanders (75/18) and Biden 72/20, particularly if you keep in mind that she has some room to grow (9 percent of Democrats say they\u2019ve never heard of her, believe it or not, and another 12 percent don\u2019t know enough to form an opinion of her).\n\nNow, these numbers still show Sanders and Biden as plausible unity figures, and some of the non\u2013Big Three candidates might fill that bill if one of them takes off between now and the time voters start voting. But the longer the Big Three continue to dominate the field, the more polarization we are likely to see, and it\u2019s probably going to most affect Biden (who more or less horrifies progressive activists and opinion leaders) and Sanders (who has the same effect on centrists, intense party regulars, and veteran Hillary Clinton fans).\n\nThe hardest thing to project is how the Warren-Sanders rivalry will play out. The two are generally thought to represent the same left-bent \u201cwing\u201d of the Democratic Party or \u201clane\u201d in the 2020 field, and they are definitely friends and allies in the Senate. But the coalitions they are putting together are far from identical, and their approaches to campaigning differ as well. If one decisively bests the other in Iowa and New Hampshire, where both candidates are strong, you could see one of them dropping out, creating a clear left-right competition with Biden (and/or one of the non\u2013Big Three candidates in the field). If for whatever reason both stick around and Biden doesn\u2019t go away either, you could see a dynamic that begs for resolution via a unifying figure.\n\nRight now, the most important advantage the old boys have over Warren is in perceived electability, which is a very big deal in this cycle. But if Trump\u2019s popularity continues to sag and Warren, along with her rivals, keeps beating him in head-to-head trial heats, that advantage could fade, particularly if party unity is valued as an element of a successful 2020 general-election campaign. She seems very aware of her positioning, as Joan Vennochi observed after watching Warren at the New Hampshire Democratic State Convention last weekend:\n\nIn the context of a vast left-tilting Democratic primary field, Warren is now wisely carving out space as a passionate progressive who\u2019s not a Sanders socialist. That was a key part of Saturday\u2019s mission. As she told New Hampshire Democrats, \u201cI get that in America there are gonna be people who are richer and people who are not so rich. And the rich are gonna own more shoes and they\u2019re gonna own more cars and they may even own more houses. But they shouldn\u2019t own more of our democracy.\u201d\n\nAs Warren walks the line of separating herself from Sanders\u2019s pure socialism while trying not to alienate his fervent believers, she\u2019s also making the case that choosing a candidate out of fear is no way to win a presidential election. \u201cI get it. I get it,\u201d she said in her speech. \u201cThere is a lot at stake, and people are scared. But we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in because we\u2019re scared. And we can\u2019t ask other people to vote for someone we don\u2019t believe in.\u201d\n\nClearly, she was referring to Biden, considered the leading candidate because of his stubborn hold on that bible of political punditry, the polls.\n\nWe\u2019ll see, perhaps beginning with this week\u2019s debate in Houston, if other candidates begin to appeal for a gathering of Democratic tribes behind their banners.", "description": "In polls of second-choice-candidate preferences and in the dynamics of the race, Elizabeth Warren is continuing to build the case that she can unify Democrats better than Sanders or Biden, which in turn may help perceptions of her electability.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/10/10-elizabeth-warren.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
