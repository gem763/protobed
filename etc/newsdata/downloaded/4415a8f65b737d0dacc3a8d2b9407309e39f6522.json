I think it's a scandal that he knew before,\" Trump said. \"I'd go a step further. I'd say he probably helped write it. ... That's a big story. He knew long before, and he helped write it, too. It's a scam.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Catherine Herridge contributed to this report.", "description": "House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., admitted on Sunday that he should have been clearer about his contact with the whistleblower who filed a complaint about President Trump\u2019s July phone call with the Ukrainian president.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/08/694940094001_6093161164001_6093163760001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
