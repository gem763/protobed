(AP) - With Michigan debuting its high-tempo, no-huddle \u201csize in space\u201d offense, a freshman helped bail the Wolverines out of an uneven performance.\n\nNo. 7 Michigan was sloppy Saturday during a 40-21 victory over Middle Tennessee in the opener for offensive coordinator Josh Gattis.\n\nBut Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said Monday that freshman running back Zach Charbonnet was perfect in protection, picking up nine blocks to lead a position group that was flawless in that category.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around pro backs that don\u2019t understand protections as well as the freshman did in this game,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cIt looks like it comes easy to him. It\u2019s like difficult math equations that a guy just gets. It catches your attention.\u201d\n\nCharbonnet also had 90 yards on eight carries in his first game after starring at Oaks Christian School in Westlake Village, California.\n\n\u201cWhen he decides to hit a hole, he\u2019s through it and out the other end,\u201d Harbaugh said.\n\nRedshirt freshman Christian Turner added 49 yards on 11 rushes after 20 total carries last season.\n\nThe backs helped steady an offense that was ugly at times, as quarterback Shea Patterson fumbled away the first play from scrimmage, one of three times Michigan quarterbacks put the ball on the ground.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s just a matter of taking care of the little things,\u201d Patterson said after the game.\n\nHarbaugh said Monday that \u201cthe ball handling is being addressed\u201d after Patterson fumbled twice and backup quarterback Dylan McCaffrey fumbled once.\n\nGattis, who came to Ann Arbor from Alabama, called plays for the first time in his career. He had McCaffrey split out wide a few times, catching a screen pass from Patterson on his first touch of the season.\n\nPreviously, the Wolverines had been called for an illegal substitution after McCaffrey split out wide, attempting to show versatility like his older brother, Christian McCaffrey of the Carolina Panthers.\n\nPatterson threw three touchdowns, finishing 17 of 29 for 203 yards. McCaffrey converted both of his passes for 17 yards and also ran for a score.\n\n\u201cShea was able to make some big plays, get some big chunk yardage throws,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cBoth really ran the offensive very efficiently.\u201d\n\nThe offense could be boosted this weekend against Army (1-0) with the return of wide receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones and left tackle Jon Runyan, who were held out last weekend with injuries.\n\nPeoples-Jones had a medical boot on his right foot Saturday and dressed in street clothes. The Detroit native led Michigan with 47 receptions, 612 yards and eight touchdowns in 2018. Runyan was an All-Big Ten selection by the coaches last season.\n\nOf the pair and injured defensive lineman Donovan Jeter, Harbaugh said \u201call three a chance to play\u201d this weekend.\n\nRedshirt freshman Ryan Hayes filled in for Runyan, teaming with right tackle Jalen Mayfield as first-time starters on the edge of the offensive line, with Harbaugh saying Hayes was his team\u2019s offensive player of the game.\n\n\u201cI was very impressed with them,\u201d senior tight end Sean MeKeon said Monday. \u201cMe and (guard Ben Bredeson) try to help them out a little bit, on the line making calls, but I really didn\u2019t feel like they needed it in the game. They both played a great game.\u201d\n\nThey also led the way for Charbonnet, who provided stability for an offense that needed it.\n\n\u201cHim and Ben Mason kind of remind me of each other,\u201d McKeon said, likening the freshman to a junior defensive tackle who converted this offseason from fullback. \u201cBoth are just really focused on football. Football guys, if you will, and always looking to get better on that. He\u2019s locked in and he\u2019s really impressive for a freshman.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With Michigan debuting its high-tempo, no-huddle \"size in space\" offense, a freshman helped bail the Wolverines out of an uneven performance.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matt Schoch"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/middle_tennessee_michigan_football_58000_c0-683-1757-1707_s1770x1032.jpg?5918b006a4dfd3692a6844d2f03ae36477f8ca46"}
