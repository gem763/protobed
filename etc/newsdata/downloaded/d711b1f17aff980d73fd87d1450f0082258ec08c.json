Those family members have served on Purdue\u2019s board.\n\nPurdue said the costs of continued litigation were \u201cstaggering,\u201d putting its legal expenses this year at nearly $250m.\n\n\u201cWithout a stay of the litigation, only lawyers will win,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nTypically, a bankruptcy filing triggers an \u201cautomatic stay\u201d of all litigation without a specific order from a judge.\n\nHowever, Purdue is seeking an injunction to stop the lawsuits because the Sacklers did not seek bankruptcy protection and there is an exception to the automatic stay for government actions that seek to enforce laws related to public health and safety.\n\nHealey said the exception gives the states a strong argument to move forward with their cases against the OxyContin maker. \u201cWe*re exercising our police power and have the right to do so,* she said.\n\nThe Sacklers have offered to cede control of Purdue to the plaintiffs and contribute at least $3bn toward the proposed settlement.\n\nHealey said the Sacklers should increase their contribution and she criticized the structure of the deal, which is premised in part on the continued sale of OxyContin, a drug that critics say helped launch the nation*s opioid addiction crisis.\n\n\u201cIts wrong that the settlement will be funded through continued sales of this deadly and dangerous drug,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Friday the Wall Street Journal reported that Purdue Pharma has sent $12bn to $13bn in profits to members of the Sackler family who own the company, according to court records and testimony filed in the company\u2019s bankruptcy case.
