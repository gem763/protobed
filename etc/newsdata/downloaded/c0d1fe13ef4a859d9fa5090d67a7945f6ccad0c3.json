Feasts built for gathering. A long-lasting partnership that continues to evolve.\n\nIT TAKES EXPERIENCE to know when to leave a dish alone. The food writer-photographer team Melissa Hamilton and Christopher Hirsheimer have cultivated their signature style of gorgeous artlessness over years of working in tandem. This summer they moved their studio, Canal House, to a larger space in Milford, N.J., and opened a restaurant on the ground floor. Their latest cookbook, \u201cCanal House: Cook Something\u201d (Sept. 10, Voracious), distills their approach down to 300 essential recipes. \u201cWe follow a really beautiful Quaker quote,\u201d Ms. Hirsheimer said. \u201c \u2018Proceed as the way opens.\u2019 And that\u2019s what we do.\u201d\n\nTheir first Slow Food Fast contribution combines two recipes from their new book, as beautiful as they are simple: grilled flank steak and charred eggplant tossed in olive oil, lemon juice and fistfuls of mint. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful rich-on-rich flavor,\u201d Ms. Hirsheimer said. \u201cThe meat is chewy and the eggplant is luscious, so it works as a kind of sauce.\u201d\n\nThe recipe involves little more than lighting a grill and letting the fire do its work. \u201cFor such a short ingredient list, you get incredibly complex flavors,\u201d Ms. Hamilton said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t be afraid to char the eggplant. It will only taste better.\u201d\n\nTOTAL TIME: 25 minutes SERVES: 4\n\n2 pounds flank steak\n\n6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling\n\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\n8 small globe or Japanese eggplants, halved lengthwise\n\nJuice of 2 lemons\n\n2 cloves garlic, smashed\n\n1 1/2 pinches red pepper flakes\n\n1 large handful mint leaves, about 1 cup, chopped\n\n1. Prepare a grill for high heat. Pat steak dry. Use a sharp knife to lightly score a crosshatch pattern on both sides of meat to prevent curling. Drizzle both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Set steak aside.\n\n2. In a large bowl, toss halved eggplants with a generous pinch of salt, half the lemon juice and 3 tablespoons olive oil until well coated.\n\n3. Grill steak over high heat until browned on both sides and medium-rare within, about 3 minutes per side. Let meat rest at least 10 minutes before slicing.\n\n4. Meanwhile, grill eggplants, cut-side down. Once flesh is browned and releases easily from grill, after 3-5 minutes, flip and grill reverse side until flesh is completely soft and skin is charred in spots, about 3 minutes more.\n\n5. Return hot eggplants to large bowl and toss with garlic, red pepper flakes, mint, remaining olive oil and lemon juice to taste until well coated. Season with salt.\n\n6. Slice steak thinly against the grain. Serve eggplant alongside meat and drizzle everything with more olive oil just before serving.", "description": "From the masters of understated elegance at Canal House, this flank steak comes with a side of charred eggplant scattered with fresh mint.", "authors": ["Kitty Greenwald"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EW775_SFF_SOC_20190904095317.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
