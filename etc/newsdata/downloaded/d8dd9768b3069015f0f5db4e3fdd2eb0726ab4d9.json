It remains to be seen whether he might be able to build on his support to include the African American community, however, which is a key demographic for Democrats and a group that is known to solidly support Mr Biden.", "description": "Hillary Clinton has told people privately that she would consider joining the 2020 Democratic primary, but only if she thought she could win.
