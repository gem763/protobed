CHEAP!\n\nYou won\u2019t find a smoother viewing experience than a 4K screen with 144Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time. Unfortunately, contraptions that fall in this product category will cost you an arm and a leg, so it\u2019s often tough to justify purchasing one (if you\u2019ve got the cash to spare in the first place). You know what\u2019s still an affordable, albeit slightly less luxurious, alternative, though? Dell\u2018s S3219D monitor \u2014 and as luck would have it, there\u2019s a succulent deal on it right now.\n\nAmazon is currently selling this 32-inch delight of a monitor with a VA panel and a QHD resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels for $180. That\u2019s 120 bucks less than its usual retail price of $300. Sure, it\u2019s only got a 60Hz refresh rate and 4ms response time, but don\u2019t let that steer you away from a good deal.\n\nPlus, there are other pros to copping one of these. It\u2019s got plenty of ports, including an HDMI port, a DisplayPort, and support for USB, and it also comes with two built-in 5W speakers.\n\n\u201cWhatever man, I\u2019ve already got a better monitor at my desk,\u201d you might say. I get that. I recently put together a gaming rig, and although I\u2019m probably going for a beefier main monitor, the S3219D is among the main contenders for a second screen. That way, I can game and do intensive editing work on my main monitor, and use the Dell for an additional 32-inches of screen real estate \u2014 for chatting, browsing, and other forms of distraction.\n\nSeriously, you can\u2019t go wrong with it.\n\nGrab the Dell S3219D for $180 from Amazon by clicking here. Quick heads-up: for some reason, the \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d option won\u2019t show up at the top. No worries, scroll down to the \u201cCompare\u201d section and you\u2019ll see it there.\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
