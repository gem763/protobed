And one\u2019s people must be entertained.\n\nBecause many progressives believe deep in their hearts that conservative men are both sexually obsessed and repressed, that conservatism is a way of looking at the world in which women are lesser, mere prey. They think this is behind everything, including conservative reservations about or opposition to abortion. In this view, conservative jurists who say things like \u201c60% of my clerks were women\u201d and \u201cI coach the girls\u2019 soccer and debate teams\u201d are engaged in an elaborate cover. They hate the modern world. Behind closed doors they\u2019re always swinging caveman\u2019s clubs.\n\nBecause where there\u2019s smoke there must be fire. There was Ms. Ford, then the Yale rumors. There\u2019s no way there isn\u2019t something to it.\n\nSo it will never end.", "description": "", "authors": ["Peggy Noonan", "Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
