The Coast Guard \"immediately issued an urgent marine information broadcast\" and sent ships and two helicopters to the scene.\n\nThe ship's command and chief engineer were assisting authorities and salvage teams in stabilizing the ship so rescue efforts could continue, the Coast Guard said. Local first responders and towing groups also were aiding the effort.\n\nThe cause of the incident was under investigation, the Coast Guard said. It was not clear whether weather conditions played a role. Hurricane Dorian brushed past the Georgia coast last week but was centered off Canada on Sunday.\n\nThe port of Brunswick was closed to boat traffic, and there was an established emergency safety zone in the St. Simons Sound. Ships were not authorized within a half-mile of the Golden Ray.\n\nThe incident comes one week after a diving boat caught fire off California's Santa Cruz Island, killing 34 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Four missing after ship capsizes, burns near Georgia coast\n\n\n\n", "description": "Rescue teams were searching for four crewmembers after a cargo ship caught fire and capsized Sunday off the Georgia coast, the Coast Guard said.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uIjBnLM8xGYCSDL73Ya65w--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/c9a65230-d25e-11e9-97fb-39e03a04ef12", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
