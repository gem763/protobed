Argentina beat Tonga then lost to England 39-10 on Saturday with 14 men. Its earliest exit in 16 years was confirmed on Sunday when France beat Tonga.\n\nThe only consolation left for Argentina is to finish third in the pool and earn automatic qualification for the 2023 tournament in, ironically, France.\n\nTo that end, plus being mindful of a four-day turnaround, Argentina coach Mario Ledesma upended his side and made nine changes to the starting lineup in hope that fresh minds and legs can give them a fresh boost.\n\nIt features the return of starting flyhalf Nicolas Sanchez, who was dropped to the reserves after the France loss, and dropped altogether after the Tonga win. Sanchez owns the Pumas test points record, but he has been off his game in Japan like so many other teammates, and been handed a chance by Ledesma to redeem himself.\n\nThere are four who will make their first appearances in this tournament, including flanker Juan Manuel Leguizamon, who will play in his fourth World Cup. He\u2019s the only survivor from the 2007 Pumas team which reached the semifinals for the first time. The others getting a first run were No. 8 Rodrigo Bruni, center Juan Cruz Mallia, and fullback Joaquin Tuculet.\n\nScrumhalf Gonzalo Bertranou, summoned on Saturday after Tomas Cubelli picked up a tournament-ending calf injury against England, could also make his first appearance off the bench. That meant only two-cap hooker Santiago Socino in the squad will not have appeared in this World Cup, as Ledesma stuck with Julian Montoya and former captain Agustin Creevy.\n\nIf finishing third is a comedown to a side that believed it could make a fourth consecutive quarterfinals, then the Pumas ought to be motivated by listening to the Americans, who have made third a major goal. The chance to automatically qualify for a Rugby World Cup for the first time is still possible.\n\n\u201cWith Argentina\u2019s short turnaround, then losing to England and not qualifying, and the disappointment they\u2019re facing, they mightn\u2019t show up as well as they would have if they were qualifying,\u201d Eagles flyhalf AJ MacGinty said. \u201cAs much as that might play a factor, we still have to back up our performance.\u201d\n\nThe Americans were mauled by England but trailed France only 12-9 with 15 minutes to go. They lost 33-9, but they were somewhat pleased, especially with their discipline. They conceded only four penalties against France, and are determined to repeat against the feisty Argentines.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is on us to deliver another performance that\u2019s even better than the France game,\u201d MacGinty said. \u201cIf we can do that as a squad and as individuals, then that puts us in a good place for beating Argentina.\u201d\n\nThe United States has lost eight straight Rugby World Cup games dating to 2011, and MacGinty said they can end the streak on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA third-place finish is something that\u2019s never been done. For us, that\u2019s a massive motivational thing,\u201d he added.\n\nTo try to end eight straight losses to Argentina over 30 years, in their first matchup in 16 years, the United States made five changes to the starting lineup, two of them positional.\n\nLock Greg Peterson is up from the reserves in the only change to the pack, Paul de Haas is at scrumhalf after Cam Dolan started in the losses to England and France, and Paul Lasike is at inside center so a tall Marcel Brache is on the wing to counter Argentina\u2019s kicking game.\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nArgentina: Joaquin Tuculet, Bautista Delguy, Juan Cruz Mallia, Jeronimo de la Fuente, Santiago Carreras, Nicolas Sanchez, Felipe Ezcurra; Rodrigo Bruni, Juan Manuel Leguizamon, Pablo Matera (captain), Matias Alemanno, Guido Petti, Santiago Medrano, Julian Montoya, Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro.
