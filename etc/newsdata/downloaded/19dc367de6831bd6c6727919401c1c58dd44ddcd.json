Long Live Fortnite.", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Epic Games\n\nIf you were planning to spend a good 24 hours or so playing Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite yesterday, you\u2019ve already discovered the terrible news yourself. During a live event (ominously entitled \u201cThe End\u201d) concluding Fortnite\u2019s tenth season on Sunday, the universe of the game was obliterated, its entire map sucked into a black hole. (You can see video of the destruction here courtesy of IGN.) But while fans might have assumed the game\u2019s new iteration would immediately launch in its stead (or at least a trailer, anything!), something more mysterious is afoot. As of early Monday morning, the game is still gone and players fervently checking for its return are treated only to the ever-present hole.\n\nMeanwhile, Fortnite also erased its Twitch account, updated its Instagram with black hole pics and deleted all its tweets but one. (You guessed it. It\u2019s a pic of the black hole.) As for when the game will return, fans are trying to furiously decipher the series of seemingly random numbers spotted floating in the void near the black hole, which at least is a fun distraction from the zero Fortnite they\u2019ll be enjoying for the foreseeable future. In the meantime, feel free to check out the black hole\u2019s livestream below.", "description": "The video game Fortnite has temporarily disappeared ahead of the game\u2019s Season 11, after sucking the game\u2019s universe into a black hole into a live event entitled \u201cThe End.\u201d", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/14-Fortnite-Season-11-The-End.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
