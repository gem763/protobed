(Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)\n\nOne man said he woke to the wealthy Democratic donor injecting him with a syringe and applying metal clamps to his body. Another told investigators how the well-known California activist pulled out a power saw as he lay immobilized by drugs. Others recalled being plied with narcotics while wearing tight underwear.\n\nThose are the some of men who survived to tell their stories, according to the criminal complaint against Ed Buck released Thursday.\n\nBuck now faces a federal charge over another alleged victim who met a grimmer fate, dying from a drug overdose in Buck\u2019s West Hollywood apartment, according to authorities. Prosecutors have accused the 65-year-old of preying on men \u201cmade vulnerable by addiction and homelessness\u201d for sex.\n\nThe federal count of distribution of methamphetamine resulting in death comes days after the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office hit Buck with charges including operating a drug house and administering methamphetamine to a 37-year-old man who authorities say survived an overdose in Buck\u2019s home earlier this month.\n\nThe latest charge implicating Buck in the death of 26-year-old Gemmel Moore \u2014 and the criminal complaint detailing the experiences of 10 more people allegedly victimized \u2014 also follows growing calls to investigate a 2017 death initially ruled an accident. Activists urged Buck\u2019s arrest after a second deadly overdose in his home earlier this year. In a wrongful-death suit filed against Buck and the district attorney, Moore\u2019s mother claimed that Buck targets black men, intoxicating them so that he can force them into sex \u2014 and accused authorities of letting off a white man far wealthier and better-connected than his victims.\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Meagan Flynn previously reported:\n\nBuck, a former fashion model and well-known LGBT activist in Los Angeles, has donated thousands to Democrats including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Rep. Ted Lieu (Calif.). Lieu said earlier this year he would donate more than $18,000 in contributions he received from Buck to LGBTQ and African American civil rights organizations. The Washington Post\n\nIf convicted of the federal charge, Buck could receive a sentence of life without parole; the crime carries a mandatory minimum of 20 years. The charges filed earlier this week could lead to a sentence of up to five years and eight months in state prison.\n\nBuck was ordered to be held without bond at his court appearance Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nAn attorney for Buck, Seymour Amster, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but earlier in the day Amster told journalists in Los Angeles that Buck would fight the allegations against him \u201cvigorously,\u201d media reports say. The lawyer dismissed accusations of singling out black men.\n\n[Democratic donor arrested after third man overdoses at his West Hollywood home]\n\nThe federal complaint released Thursday draws on many men\u2019s accounts of Buck\u2019s alleged predatory behavior. But the charges rest on Moore, who investigators say was discovered unresponsive and wearing only socks in Buck\u2019s living room in July of 2017. An autopsy attributed the death to an overdose from methamphetamine apparently injected in Moore\u2019s arm.\n\nBuck, who called 911 to say Moore was not breathing, told officials that the dead man was his friend and that he had not seen Moore\u2019s drug injection, the criminal complaint states. But acquaintances of Moore\u2019s told authorities Buck paid Moore and gave him narcotics in exchange for sex. Moore\u2019s mother, LaTisha Nixon, would later tell investigators that her son had called her the year before to say \u201ca rich and powerful man named Ed Buck held [him] against his will and shot him up with drugs,\u201d as court documents put it.\n\nThe district attorney decided there was not enough evidence to charge Buck. A slew of other incidents, though, would create mounting pressure for authorities to take action.\n\nA year and a half after Moore\u2019s death, authorities found another near-naked man on Buck\u2019s floor \u2014 this time, wearing only underwear. Timothy Dean, too, was declared dead after police arrived. An autopsy pointed again to drugs, and again, no charges followed.\n\nWhat did come was a firestorm of public criticism, as thousands signed a petition calling for Buck\u2019s arrest and as Nixon filed a lawsuit saying Dean would still be alive if Buck had faced legal repercussions for her son\u2019s overdose.\n\n\u201cIf the dead body of a blond-haired, blue-eyed white man was found in the home of an older black man, he\u2019d be lucky to even make it to the police station alive,\u201d the Los Angeles Times reported an attorney for Nixon saying.\n\nBuck was well-known among prostitutes for exchanging drugs and money for sex, another alleged victim reportedly told law enforcement. People called him \u201cDoctor Kevorkian,\u201d one man said, a reference to the prominent advocate of physician-assisted suicide.\n\nInvestigators came to believe that Buck continued giving men drugs for sexual favors after Dean\u2019s death, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nA man identified in documents only as \u201cVictim 10\u201d described getting methamphetamine from Buck every day for weeks before overdosing put him in the hospital earlier this month. Victim 10 recalls Buck refusing to call an ambulance during his Sept. 11 overdose, the criminal complaint states. The man said he got help only after leaving Buck\u2019s apartment and getting a passerby to call 911.\n\nThat latest incident helped trigger the charges filed against Buck this week.\n\n\u201cThe surviving victim\u2019s statements gave us the break we needed,\u201d said Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nLacey said Thursday that federal law provides more options for charging Buck than state law, allowing for charges that could carry lengthier prison sentence, according to CBS Los Angeles. Local authorities did not find enough evidence to hold Buck responsible for the overdose deaths, Lacey said.\n\nRead more:\n\nHe\u2019s suspected in four women\u2019s deaths \u2014 and \u2018would have killed again,\u2019 sheriff says\n\nCongresswoman: Activist suspected in overdoses roamed free", "description": "According to a criminal complaint, one man said he woke to the Democratic donor injecting him with a syringe and applying metal clamps to his body while another said the California activist pulled out a power saw as he lay immobilized by drugs.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "September At Pm", "Hannah Knowles Is A Reporter On The General Assignment Team.
