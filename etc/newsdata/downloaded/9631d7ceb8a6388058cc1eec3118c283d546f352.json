The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 107 points, or 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite was little changed.\n\nFinancials outperformed the broader market as Treasury yields inched higher, pushing prices down. One of the biggest winners was Wells Fargo, whose shares climbed 4% after the San Francisco bank appointed Charles Scharf as president and chief executive. Mr. Scharf is leaving Bank of New York Mellon to succeed C. Allen Parker, interim CEO since Timothy Sloan resigned in late March.\n\nShares of Bank of America added 1.3%, while JPMorgan edged up 1%.\n\nMeanwhile, investors sold traditionally safer assets like gold and U.S. government bonds, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 1.697%, according to Tradeweb, from 1.685% Thursday.\n\nFriday's move puts major indexes within an inch of their record highs. Still, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were on track to end the week with slim losses, and the week was marked by some big intraday moves as investors parsed the outlook on a trade deal between the U.S. and China alongside political developments from Washington. House Democrats have sought impeachment proceedings against President Trump.\n\nInvestors continued to watch for signs of the health of the domestic economy, especially as concerns about wobbling growth worldwide have mounted.\n\n\"I think the markets are kind of trading sideways,\" said Adrian Helfert, director of multi-asset portfolios at Westwood Holdings Group. \"I wouldn't expect more appreciation until we see the whites of the eyes of growth.\"\n\nFresh data showed U.S. consumer spending slowed more than expected in August, a sign that a key part of the economy could be losing steam.\n\nMeanwhile, one proxy for business investment -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- declined in August, recording its weakest performance since April, the Commerce Department said.\n\nStill, the wild moves that punctuated markets in August have recently receded. The S&P remains on track for its 16th consecutive day without a move of 1% in either direction, the longest streak since July.\n\nGlobal oil benchmark Brent crude slipped 0.8% after The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia moved to impose a partial cease-fire in Yemen. Houthi forces in a surprise move last week declared a unilateral cease-fire in the country.\n\nCorporate news drove swings among shares of individual companies. Shares of Micron Technology tumbled 8.9% after the company reported late Thursday a decline in sales and earnings in the latest quarter.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.4% in afternoon trade, with the U.K.'s FTSE 100 up 1% after a Bank of England official said an interest-rate cut could be needed even if a Brexit deal is agreed.\n\nElsewhere, stocks closed broadly lower in Asia, with Tokyo's Nikkei down 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng down 0.3%. Shares in Shanghai were an outlier, edging up 0.1%.\n\nKaren Langley contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 27, 2019 11:46 ET (15:46 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
