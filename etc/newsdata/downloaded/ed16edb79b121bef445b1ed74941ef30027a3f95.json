You can even get a sense for a variety of textures when running through fields of grass or plodding through mud.\u2019\n\n\u2018The second innovation is something we call adaptive triggers, which have been incorporated into the trigger buttons (L2/R2)\u2019, added Ryan.\n\n\u2018Developers can program the resistance of the triggers so that you feel the tactile sensation of drawing a bow and arrow or accelerating an off-road vehicle through rocky terrain. In combination with the haptics, this can produce a powerful experience that better simulates various actions\u2019\n\nRyan ended the short blog by re-confirming Death Stranding, The Last of Us Part II, and Ghost Of Tsushima as \u2018PS4 exclusives\u2019, with no suggestion of PlayStation 5 versions.\n\nThat in itself could be a hint at the PlayStation 5\u2019s greater emphasis on backwards compatibility, but details on that will have to wait for a future update.\n\nBut after this it seems as if Sony is moving up a gear in terms of its next gen talk, so we\u2019d expect to hear more fairly soon.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Sony patent shows PlayStation 5 devkit \u2013 or maybe even the console itself\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Sony planning to acquire more game developers for PlayStation 5\n\nMORE: PlayStation 5 will focus on \u2018hardcore gamers\u2019 and big budget exclusive says Sony", "description": "Sony has confirmed that their next console is called the PS5 and will be out this time next year, as they also hint at a new controller.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/playstation-870096966-eca0_1570541571.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
