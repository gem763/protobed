Her company, Viva Vita, is designed to bring virtual-reality experiences to older men and women who can no longer travel.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s different,\u201d Halsey said about his virtual tour through Botswana. He described orangutans and tigers that appeared in the bulky set of goggles on his face.\n\nBerryman created Viva Vita while still a student at George Washington University. She secured $5,000 in seed money from the school\u2019s New Venture Competition for budding entrepreneurs.\n\nBerryman entered the competition as a senior \u2014 advancing through several rounds while studying for exams and preparing for graduation \u2014 and won the runner-up cash prize in April. The money has helped pay for equipment and cover costs associated with registering the company.\n\nSince 2009, the university has given more than $2.3 million in cash prizes and in-kind contributions \u2014 such as co-working spaces and legal services \u2014 to about 2,000 student entrepreneurs, said Lex McCusker, director of student entre\u00adpre\u00adneur\u00adship programs at GWU.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nColleges have been criticized for graduating students who feel unprepared for the real world. But McCusker said the money from GWU has helped graduates launch successful start-ups, including the beverage company Capital Kombucha, the digital marketing agency Social Driver and KnoNap \u2014 a napkin that turns colors when it detects sedatives and \u201cdate rape\u201d drugs in drinks.\n\nThis summer, GWU hosted 10 small businesses in its inaugural Summer StartupAccelerator. Berryman and her student intern spent nine weeks refining the company\u2019s business model, connecting with local retirement communities and developing a pitch for investors.\n\n\u201cWe did have some investor interest. We had two or three people that we\u2019re still talking to now,\u201d Berryman said. \u201cWe want to gain some more traction and show someone why they should invest.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHalsey\u2019s wife, Ellie Dasenbrook, 73, stood behind her husband\u2019s wheelchair as he watched the 360-degree video inside his headset. Unlike traditional videos, 360-degree videos are recorded by shooting multiple directions at once. They provide a panoramic view that moves with the viewer.\n\nA smile spread across Dasenbrook\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cThis type of activity is exactly what they need. They can\u2019t travel like they used to, but they should still have these opportunities,\u201d said Dasenbrook, who visits her husband every day at Powhatan. \u201cThey need the cognitive exercise.\u201d\n\nThe virtual-reality video used by 90-year-old Mary Chiappetta took her swimming under ice caps in Antarctica.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI usually watch these things on television,\u201d Chiappetta said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful project. You\u2019ve seen pictures before, but this is right in front of you.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBerryman got the idea for Viva Vita about two years ago at GWU when she started learning about high rates of anxiety and depression among older Americans. It made Berryman think about her 78-year-old grandmother.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something you think about as a young person at all,\u201d Berryman said. \u201cTheir symptoms of anxiety or depression go unnoticed or go untreated, and it\u2019s this accepted part of aging.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, adults 85 and older had one of the nation\u2019s highest suicide rates: 20.1 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The national average among all age groups is 14 deaths per 100,000 Americans.\n\nAD\n\nJordan Yates, Powhatan\u2019s activities coordinator, said the facility has a geriatric psychiatrist who talks to residents and adjusts their medication dosages. In her role, Yates encourages \u201cas much socialization as possible\u201d among residents.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s a good way to get them back into the community,\u201d Yates said about the virtual-reality goggles. \u201cIt\u2019s bringing them back to the things that they enjoy.\u201d\n\nViva Vita, a mash-up of Spanish and Latin, means \u201clive life,\u201d Berryman said.\n\n\u201cMaybe we can bring some joy back into these seniors\u2019 lives,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can bring something exciting to them so they can keep learning and exploring the world.\u201d\n\nBerryman used her own money and the $5,000 she earned in the New Venture Competition to purchase goggles from Oculus, a virtual-reality company owned by Facebook. She finds free 360-degree travel videos online to play inside the headsets.\n\nAD\n\nBerryman said she has earned \u201ca few thousand dollars in the past few months\u201d by booking sessions with about 10 suburban retirement communities, including Powhatan.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m able to pay my rent, and that is great for me,\u201d she said.\n\nResidents who experimented with virtual reality said they would try it again.\n\nAlice Murray, 87, said next time, she would like to travel virtually to Ireland. She called the country home for 20 years.\n\n\u201cIt was good seeing all these things without getting out your chair,\u201d she said.\n\nAD", "description": "With seed money from GWU, Carleigh Berryman founded Viva Vita, which uses virtual-reality goggles for its treks.", "authors": ["Lauren Lumpkin", "Reporting Fellow Focusing On Local Education Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OZFYjeOVpeAND4EjU5dL5NupAAs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DZ2XCUXLSUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
