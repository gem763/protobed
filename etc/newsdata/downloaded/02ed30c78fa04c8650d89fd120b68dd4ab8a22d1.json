Here\u2019s why.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, James said he did not want to get into a \u201cfeud\u201d with Morey and felt it should be handled behind closed doors. However, he said there are consequences to freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cWe all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others, and you\u2019re only thinking about yourself,\u201d James said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in a word sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke. And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually.\n\n\u201cSo just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.\u201d\n\nJames took to Twitter shortly after to say he meant Morey was uneducated on the potential impact of his tweet, not the substance of it.\n\nLet me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nStill, some criticized James for his initial comments.\n\nso the natural follow up is: What does LeBron think the situation in China is, if Morey was misinformed? https://t.co/yt7jS5UigX \u2014 Mina Kimes (@minakimes) October 15, 2019\n\nI actually can't believe that LeBron, who had DAYS to think about his answer, went with blaming Daryl Morey and saying that it was MOREY who was uneducated in speaking about the topic. And then suggests it was MOREY who was selfish here, instead of the Chinese government. \u2014 Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 15, 2019\n\nMore Than An Athlete (unless it threatens business partnerships) https://t.co/bAcKlgx7VI \u2014 Mike Prada (@MikePradaSBN) October 15, 2019\n\n\"there are ramifications for not thinking about others and only thinking about yourself\" is for sure a take when discussing a pro-democracy protest https://t.co/YkGmhu5Qhs \u2014 Robby Kalland #BriocheBoys (@RKalland) October 15, 2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in my best interests to talk about a complex issue I don\u2019t know enough about\u201d. What every NBA player probably should say now when asked about NBA/China crisis. https://t.co/gja72iYaNH \u2014 Marc Berman (@NYPost_Berman) October 15, 2019\n\nAfter Morey\u2019s tweet, several Chinese businesses suspended operations with the Rockets and/or NBA. The timing was awkward for the NBA, as the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets went to China shortly after Morey\u2019s tweet to play a preseason game.\n\nChina has been a burgeoning market for the NBA, one the league has spent years developing as it has grown a large and passionate fanbase in recent years. The NBA was initially criticized for its response to Chinese outrage to Morey\u2019s tweet, as many accused the league of caring more about its bottom line than freedom of speech.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver later made clear that the league would not apologize for Morey\u2019s tweet, saying only the outrage was unfortunate, and he hoped the two sides could move forward.\n\nWhile the preseason game was not shown on Chinese TV, the game was played despite fears of it being canceled.\n\nVideo of James\u2019 comments can be seen below:", "description": "Business Insider - LeBron James said he didn't think Daryl Morey was educated on the potential impact of his Hong Kong tweet..
