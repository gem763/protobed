Melissa Montoya, MMONTOYA@NEWS-PRESS.COM\n\nFORT MYERS, Fla. \u2013 For Michael Sturgis, it was a case of mistaken identity and racial profiling that he said could have cost him his life.\n\nThe 36-year-old Cape Coral man said a Fort Myers police officer pointed a gun at him last week while he was working because she confused him for a robbery suspect.\n\nBesides being black, Sturgis wore a construction vest like the suspect. But that's where the similarities end.\n\nThe incident happened on July 2 as Sturgis waited in a bucket truck for his workday to begin. He, a co-worker and his foreman watched as crews prepared to close down traffic so they could begin taking down power lines near an intersection.\n\nBut instead, his day was interrupted by an encounter with Fort Myers police. The father of six pleaded for his innocence, his hands in the air in hopes that the officer, whose gun was pointed at him, would not shoot.\n\n\"She was very hostile,\" Sturgis said, adding that he plans to file a complaint against the department.\n\nOld Navy apologizes: Woman who says she was racially profiled in Canada shop\n\nHow did a routine Tuesday morning go so terribly wrong for Sturgis?\n\nJust north of where Sturgis waited, police got a report of a black man, age of 31 and 31-35, who allegedly entered a pay day loan store, demanded money from a worker and fled. The worker said the man wore black jeans, construction boots, a green vest and a floppy hat, according to a Fort Myers police news release. The news release did not say whether the man was armed.\n\nSoon after the robbery, three Fort Myers police officers stopped and asked Sturgis' crew if they saw anything out of the ordinary. They hadn't, Sturgis said they told them.\n\n\"They told us about a robbery and we had no idea about it and were cooperative with them,\" he said. \"They said (the suspect) had on work vests like you guys, and we told them we didn't see anyone or anybody and they left.\"\n\nMichael Sturgis feels like he was wrongfully and aggressively pursued by FMPD for a crime he didn't commit.

Sturgis was perched on the passenger seat of his work truck, the door open, and his legs outside of the vehicle.\n\nHe said he was looking at his phone and didn't hear the first command to get out of the vehicle. When he looked up during the second command, Sturgis said, the officer had already raised her duty weapon at him.\n\n\"I got a gun drew on me. She scared the hell out of me when that happened, you understand,\" Sturgis said.\n\n\"The only thing I could say is, 'I didn't do anything,' \" he said.\n\nSturgis said he was profiled because the only similarity he had with the suspect was his race and a construction vest he wears for work. His co-worker, who was with him when he was confronted by the officer, was white, Sturgis said.\n\nSturgis was handcuffed for a few minutes. The three other officers returned to the scene.\n\n\"I pointed at the officer with my hands cuffed and was like that\u2019s the officer right there we pretty much talked to earlier and I was just saying 'please could you uncuff me? Could you let me go? I didn't do anything,' \" Sturgis said.\n\nPolice are looking for a man who made off with cash from Fast Pay Day Loans on South Cleveland Avenue on Tuesday.

By then Sturgis said he felt like he had been harassed by police.\n\nThe next day, Sturgis said he saw a picture of the suspect that was shared by the police department on social media.\n\n\"The picture that I had of the suspect looked nothing like me,\" Sturgis said. \"I can see in the picture I'm much bigger than the suspect. ... The guy that I'm seeing is very skinny. He's very small.\"\n\nSturgis called and left a message for Fort Myers Police Chief Derrick Diggs after the incident. He said he did not hear from the chief but he got a call from Capt. Bill Newhouse, who oversees internal affairs investigations.\n\nSturgis also went to the Lee County chapter of the NAACP on Wednesday.\n\n\"I came here to get some type of closure about my situation.\" Sturgis said. \"I'm scared and I feel like I needed to talk to somebody.\"\n\nSturgis left with a complaint form he expected to fill out and turn into the police department.\n\nFort Myers Deputy Police Chief Jeffrey Meyers confirmed that the agency is investigating but declined to comment further.\n\nMichael Sturgis feels like he was wrongfully and aggressively pursued by FMPD for a crime he didn't commit.

For that to happen to someone who is doing good, I mean clients could view you, look at you differently and stuff like that.\"\n\nSturgis said he is disappointed with the behavior of the officer.\n\n\"My mind \u2013 I am still, like, distraught by it,\" Sturgis said. \"I'm afraid right now. I don\u2019t know what to expect when I'm looking at an officer or when I'm close by an officer or an officer is behind me.\"\n\nThis is not the first time accusations have been made against the Fort Myers Police Department.\n\nIn 2017, the city of Fort Myers settled a lawsuit filed by NFL star Nate Allen for a wrongful arrest in 2015.\n\nThe city paid out $440,000 for mistaking Allen for a suspect who exposed himself to a teenage victim. In that case, officers were looking for a \"mixed-race\" man, in his 40s or 50s, with a gray/white goatee. Allen was in his 20s at the time and had little to no facial hair.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/07/09/florida-man-says-racial-profiling-led-police-pointing-gun-him/1688194001/", "description": "A 36-year-old Florida man was waiting to start work when he says a Fort Myers police officer pointed a gun at him  in case of mistaken identity.", "authors": ["Melissa Montoya", "Published P.M.
