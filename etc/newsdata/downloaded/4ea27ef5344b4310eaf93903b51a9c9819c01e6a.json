It\u2019s also important to have more investment in Wildlife Trust outdoor volunteering which has been proven to improve mental, physical and social wellbeing.\n\n\u2018In addition, we need many more wild, natural places near to where people live and work. That way, green prescribing can be rolled-out everywhere.\n\n\u2018This would help the NHS save money, as well as help nature to recover.\u2019\n\nIt might be a while before GPs are regularly prescribing time in nature, but in the meantime this research gives us all a nudge to get outside and spend some time in green spaces for the sake of our mental health.\n\nNeed support?
