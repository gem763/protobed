The Yang campaign told POLITICO that the wrong card was used for those purchases, and the campaign will be reimbursed by the candidate.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwalwell\u2019s strategic shoelace reserve\n\nThe day Rep. Eric Swalwell dropped out of the presidential race, his campaign transferred some of its assets over to his House campaign committee as he prepares to run for reelection in California\u2019s 15th Congressional District. That includes over $7,000 worth of shoelaces branded with the hashtag #Swalwelling, a reference to the congressman\u2019s habit of snapping pictures of his shoes when he boards airplanes heading back to his district from D.C.\n\nTravel like a local\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s short-lived campaign spent about $1,000 on one of New York City\u2019s famed yellow taxi companies, NYC Taxi, before de Blaso dropped out. The mayor recently rejected a city-funded bailout for taxi drivers struggling to pay off loans after the industry collapsed in the city, but backed a federal bailout instead.\n\nElsewhere in local transportation, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee\u2019s campaign paid $181 to Washington State Ferries for \u201cferry travel\u201d before he too dropped out of the presidential race.\n\nThe field of dreams\n\nSeveral campaigns made time for sports on the trail. Beto O\u2019Rourke spent a bit over $300 on tickets to the Iowa Cubs, the AAA affiliate of the Chicago Cubs. His campaign also spent money for Iowa Cubs tickets in the second quarter where he (and Biden) appeared at a naturalization ceremony happening on the field.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, meanwhile, who often posted her workout routines on social media during her run, spent $900 for event space at FortCycle in Manchester, N.H., and Momentum Cycling Studio in Los Altos, Calif.\n\nAnd Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s campaign dropped $250 on tickets to the Upstate HBCU Classic, a South Carolina college football game between historically black schools. (Booker played college football himself, lettering for Stanford in 1989 and 1990.) Local media reported that his campaign \u2014 along with the campaigns for Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 had tailgates before the game, and that Rep. Tim Ryan attended.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. | Cheryl Senter/AP Photo\n\nThere's an app for that\n\nUber reigns supreme in the battle of the rideshare companies. Collectively, the Democratic presidential field spent over $70,000 on Uber (and the occasional UberEats) while spending $66,000 on Lyft. Harris spent the most on rideshares among all the candidates, dropping close to $23,000.\n\nClassic left-wing flower power\n\nOne surprising, relatively small line item that popped up across a bunch of different campaigns was flowers. POLITICO found more than $7,000 in combined purchases from florists by Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Gillibrand, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren and Marianne Williamson.\n\nThe candidate with the sweetest-smelling campaign? That\u2019s probably Buttigieg, who spent close to $3,100 on floral arrangements.\n\nThe next Magic Johnson?\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign paid \u201cDJ Prince Ice\u201d from Columbia, S.C. $350 for event entertainment, after the well-known local DJ performed at the basketball tournament mentioned above.\n\n\u201cI thought [the basketball tournament] was great,\u201d said Allen University student government association president Trevaris Brown, who co-hosted the event. \u201c[Sanders] got a trophy for the winning team \u2026 he was really invested in the local community [and] he\u2019s down to earth person \u2026 he talked about things that really help the rest of us.\u201d\n\nThe fender bender\n\nCampaigns are putting a lot of miles on rental cars in Iowa, New Hampshire and elsewhere as they stump for votes. But one trip a campaign probably wants back? Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s campaign paid Enterprise\u2019s \u201cdamage recovery unit\u201d $500 for \u201ccar rental repair.\u201d\n\nGabbard\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, decided to buy, paying just under $119,000 to Shafer's Truck & RV Sales in Delta, Ohio for a vehicle purchase.\n\nAnd when you're on the road, sometimes you see hotels more than your own bed. For former Rep. Joe Sestak, that meant one particular hotel. His campaign paid $14,000 to the same Econo Lodge Inn & Suites in Des Moines, Iowa over the course of the quarter.\n\nSome campaigns traveled in style: Biden\u2019s campaign dropped $924,000 on to Advanced Aviation \u2014 a private jet charter company \u2014 and $44,000 on Biden\u2019s beloved Amtrak.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s campaign also spent big on charter flights. His campaign spent close to $447,000 to three companies: Advanced Aviation, Vertivue Air Charter and Evojets. Sen. Kamala Harris also got in on the private air travel game. Her campaign spent about $238,000 to charter companies like Air Partner and Zen Air.\n\nA supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang wears a \"MATH\" hat. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nBig spenders\n\nSteyer spent $47 million in the quarter, easily the most out of any the Democrats (and it was almost exclusively self-funded). That's about $261,000 for every minute he was standing on Tuesday night\u2019s debate stage. By far his largest expense was advertising. He spent $15.6 million on disbursements itemized as \u201cmedia buy\u201d and $14.8 million on \u201cdigital advertising.\u201d\n\nNo other campaigns are advertising at that intensity on TV yet. After paying his staff, Yang\u2019s second-biggest expense for the quarter was $526,426 the campaign spent on merchandise \u2014 presumably including the MATH hats Yang sells on his website.\n\nAnd, a nice gesture\n\nButtigieg and O\u2019Rourke have sparred recently through the media and on the debate stage, but they\u2019ve shown solidarity too. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign spent about $400 to send a care package to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign after the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas in early August.\n\nMaggie Severns, Elena Schneider and Scott Bland contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c1/b3/22fbb74f4b7bbfe2379bcae67213/191017-2020-candidates-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
