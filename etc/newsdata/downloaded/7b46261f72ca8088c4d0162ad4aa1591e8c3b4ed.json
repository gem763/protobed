Outside the Albert Hall, the day began with a queue for arena tickets forming before most people had eaten breakfast. It ended inside with the audience on its feet, the arena full of glowing smartphone screens as people took the pictures that would prove they had been there. The performance lived up to all of that: here was evidence that some conductors\u2019 powers don\u2019t diminish with age.\n\nHaitink, who celebrated his 90th birthday in the spring, had chosen to bow out in front of the Vienna Philharmonic with Beethoven and Bruckner: this short concert series taking in the major European festivals, ending in Lucerne on Friday, was billed as a farewell tour. With Murray Perahia ill, the piano soloist in Beethoven\u2019s Concerto No 4 was Emanuel Ax, ideally teamed with Haitink and the orchestra in an ensemble interpretation that was elegant and often deceptively gentle, any gestures at aggression quickly tempered, but with genuine darkness at its heart. The piano trills that led the slow movement towards its close were fearsome, the music around them pregnant with possibility. Ax\u2019s encore, Schubert\u2019s Impromptu Op 142, No 2, was perfectly judged for the occasion \u2013 simple, reflective and meaningful, without upstaging what had gone before.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elegant and deceptively gentle...

The Symphony No 7 was where we got to luxuriate in the sound he drew from the Vienna Phil, with its velvety strings and its perfectly blended brass section. The ensemble breathed together each time the opening melody bloomed, and sounded almost like an organ during the climactic second-movement passage when Bruckner gave us just a glimpse of the size of the work we were listening to. Haitink\u2019s pacing was masterful, and the special yet contained sound at that moment was characteristic of it. It\u2019s a cliche to talk of Bruckner\u2019s vast symphonies as cathedrals in sound: it suggests you can see the whole edifice from the start, which is a forbidding and limiting way to think about music that is so beautiful in the moment. Perhaps it would be better to think of a journey on a dark underground river, with the conductor holding the lantern: you can see each rock formation as you pass, but only towards the end does someone turn on a light and make you realise you have been passing through every inch of a vast and spectacular cavern.\n\nHaitink, as ever, emphasised beauty over structure, yet did not allow the music\u2019s sense of shape to slacken for a moment. One episode flowed into the next, Bruckner\u2019s melodies coming back again and again, inevitably yet never quite predictably, turning themselves upside-down and back to front. Standing behind a music stand that held a score he didn\u2019t even bother to open, or seated on a high stool, Haitink retained his old, almost birdlike poise and precision of movement, and kept his authority even when the orchestra weren\u2019t playing: a genial flick of the hand at the start told the audience to stop cheering and let him get on with it; another broke the thick silence that followed the symphony\u2019s final note.\n\nAccording to his programme biography, Haitink is not retiring, merely taking a sabbatical. He\u2019ll always be welcome back.\n\n\u2022 Available for 30 days on BBC Sounds.
