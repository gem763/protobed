Emergencies, historically, are a time of great innovation and often bring out the best in us,\" said Stuart Cowan, regenerative development director at Capital Institute, a US-based finance think-tank.\n\n\"We need to start from scratch. We need to design economies that allow people to flourish within the limits of a finite planet,\" Mr Cowan told AFP.\n\nWith a eye on funding, Secretary-General Scotland is to take forward the meeting's initiatives to upcoming summits of Commonwealth trade and finance ministers.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Life & Culture - [LONDON] The Commonwealth on Friday launched an ideas-sharing network to tackle the effects of climate change through replicable regeneration projects. .
