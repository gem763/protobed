[Photo provided to China Daily]\n\nAs one of the most diligent stars in Hong Kong, Nick Cheung stars as a hypnotist in his latest film Guilt by Design, his fourth movie to hit domestic theaters this year.\n\nDirected and written by a trio of newcomers, Kenneth Lai, Paul Sze and Lau Wing-tai, the suspense thriller features Cheung as a hypnotist who is a member of a jury.\n\nWhen Cheung's character is attending a trial, he receives a call that pressures him to induce hypnosis on the other jury members to reverse a verdict, or else his daughter \u2013 kidnapped by mysterious criminals \u2013 will be murdered.\n\nCheung, a two-time Best Actor winner at the Hong Kong Film Awards, said the role was a new experience, as it was the first time he's played a hypnotist in an acting career spanning three decades.\n\nDuring the recent Beijing premiere, Cheung said he read a lot of books and searched online about hypnosis, and invited professional hypnotists to demonstrate how people react when induced into a hypnotic state.\n\nThe movie also stars Zhang Han, best known for China's all-time, highest-grossing blockbuster, Wolf Warrior 2.\n\nZhang plays the Cheung's brother-in-law, a former special forces member who becomes key in the hunt for the criminals.\n\nThe film was released across China on Friday. Unfortunately, its screen share abruptly fell from 17.2 percent on opening day to 4.7 percent as of Monday, due to its powerful rival, Better Days, a coming-of-age hit about school violence.", "description": "As one of the most diligent stars in Hong Kong, Nick Cheung stars as a hypnotist in his latest film Guilt by Design, his fourth movie to hit domestic theaters this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/29/5db7d6b6a310cf3e97a36571.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
