USA TODAY\n\nVideo gamers might be buzzing about Apple Arcade \u2013 a just-launched gaming subscription service from the world\u2019s biggest tech company \u2013 but many might\u2019ve missed Google\u2019s announcement last week, tied to its own service, Google Play Pass.\n\nWait, what?\n\nDon\u2019t worry, we can bring you up to speed.\n\nBoth affordable subscription services offer a ton of content to play around with, without ads or in-app purchases, that can be accessed on several devices.\n\nSimilar approach, sure, and Google\u2019s timing \u2013 immediately following Apple\u2019s launch \u2013 isn\u2019t likely a coincidence, but there are some differences between Google Play Pass and Apple Arcade.\n\nHere\u2019s a comparative look at the two platforms.\n\nApple\u2019s new gaming service enjoys an easy-to-navigate interface \u2013 to help find the right titles for you and your family. (Photo: Apple)\n\nPlatforms, cost\n\nFor $4.99/month after a 30-day free trial, Apple Arcade boasts 100+ new and exclusive games within its launch window (currently, there are more than 70 games, with an additional 30 rolling out over new few weeks, says Apple). By \u201cexclusive,\u201d Apple says these games cannot be found on any other mobile platform, but a few might have a console or PC version. With a wide selection of genres to choose from, Apple Arcade titles are playable on iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, and Apple TV, and with Mac coming next month. Families of up to five people can share an account. The interface is easy to navigate through, allowing you to see profiled games, browse by genre, search, read reviews, and more.\n\nApple Arcade: This is what will make the subscription service a winner\n\nGame over? Video game retailer GameStop closing 180 to 200 stores globally\n\nGoogle Play Pass also costs $4.99/month after a 10-day free trial, but there\u2019s currently a promotion that offers the service for $1.99/month for the first year \u2013 so long as you sign up on or before Oct. 10.\n\nGoogle Play Pass offers more than 350 games and app for a low monthly subscription cost. (Photo: Google)\n\nAccording to Google, there are more than 350 games and apps available through the service. Like Apple, the selection will be refreshed on a regular basis, to keep things fresh. Games make up more than two-thirds of the content, but unlike Apple, the games consist of previously released titles and might be available on other mobile (or other) platforms.\n\nGoogle Play Pass works with Android phones, tablets and Chromebooks (running Android 4.4 or later). The account can be shared with up to five other family members (totaling six members, in total).\n\nSelection of games\n\nApple Arcade has a slew of impressive launch titles ranging from arcade fun (\"Frogger in Toy Town\"), puzzle games (\"Where Cards Fall\"), and story-based action (\"The Pathless\") to adventure titles (\"Beyond a Steel Sky\"), sports (\"Skate City\") and role-playing games (like \"Oceanhorn 2: Knights of the Lost Realm\").\n\nThere really is something for everyone, here, including kids (\"LEGO Brawls\"), tweens (\"Projection: First Light\"), teens (\"Hot Lava\") and adults (\"Bleak Sword\").\n\nStart playing on one device, pick up on another, play online or off, and these games work with Screen Time and parental controls.\n\nWhile not new or exclusive, Google has curated a collection of great games across several genres, including the likes of \"Monument Valley,\" \"Terraria,\" Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic,\" \"Risk,\" \"LIMBO,\" \"Mini Metro,\" and \"Old Man\u2019s Journey,\" to name a few.\n\nLike Apple, there\u2019s a strong value proposition, especially considering some games may cost as much as $7.99 on its own (like \"Stardew Valley\"), which is included here as part of the one low price per month. Coming next month are games like \"This War of Mine,\" a war-based survival thriller, and \"Cytus,\" a rhythm game.\n\nAll games work with parental controls, so parents can decide what tiles they allow the kids to play.\n\nFor both services, it should be noted you don\u2019t own the games \u2013 it\u2019s more of a rental model \u2013 so you can\u2019t go back to your saved game if you stop paying for the service.\n\nSeveral Apple devices work with Apple Arcade, including Macs next month. (Photo: Apple)\n\nSummary\n\nUnless you use devices that run both Apple and Android (usually it\u2019s either-or), these two services aren\u2019t really in competition with one another. That is, Google Play Pass won\u2019t appeal to someone on an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or Mac as it\u2019s simply not supported by that hardware. Same goes for those who use an Android phone or tablet, or Chromebook, because Apple Arcade won\u2019t work with those devices.\n\nEven if you do own both Apple and Android-based machines, there are differences here. Subjectively speaking, Apple has better-quality games, they\u2019re newer, and you won\u2019t find them on other mobile devices. These can be played on a TV, too, if you own Apple TV.\n\nBut Google trumps Apple in quantity (more than 250 games opposed to 70 right now) and bests Apple in price (temporarily $1.99/month for the first year compared to Apple\u2019s $4.99/month). Plus, Google Play Pass also includes many ad-free apps tied to productivity, fitness, stargazing, and many others -- if that\u2019s of interest to you.\n\nBecause of the relatively low cost and (mostly) high caliber of games, you really can\u2019t go wrong with either Apple Arcade or Google Play Pass. It\u2019s a win for gamers on the go, across the board.\n\nFollow Marc on Twitter: @marc_saltzman.
