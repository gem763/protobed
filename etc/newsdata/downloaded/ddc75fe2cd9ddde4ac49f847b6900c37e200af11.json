Schumer, saying Mr. Schumer\u2019s efforts on the gun issue haven\u2019t yielded results.\n\n\u201cAsk Chuck Schumer what he\u2019s been able to get done,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke told reporters in Colorado, according to Politico. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have background checks. Didn\u2019t have them when he was in the majority, either. So the game that he\u2019s played, the politics that he\u2019s pursued have given us absolutely nothing and have produced a situation where we lose nearly 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke, a former Texas congressman, was responding to comments Mr. Schumer made about his call for a mandatory gun buyback program for semiautomatic firearms like the AR-15.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O\u2019Rourke, but it\u2019s no excuse not to go forward,\u201d Mr. Schumer had told New York reporters on a conference call.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke was holding an event near the movie theater where a gunman killed 12 people in 2012 and said he was open to expanding his proposal.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a way to improve what we have proposed, I want to make sure that we\u2019re reflecting that,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
