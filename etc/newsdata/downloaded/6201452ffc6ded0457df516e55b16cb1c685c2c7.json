REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo\n\nIt is the latest move by Netmarble, which holds more than a quarter of South Korea\u2019s mobile gaming market, to find new growth in non-core areas. Last year it bought a 26% stake in Big Hit Entertainment, which manages the Korean boy band, BTS, for about $170 million.\n\nWoongjin Thinkbig (095720.KS), Woongjin Coway\u2019s biggest shareholder, said on Monday it was negotiating terms with Netmarble, but gave no further details. Netmarble did not comment further on its selection as the preferred bidder.\n\nThe 25% stake is worth about 1.5 trillion won ($1.27 billion) based on Woongjin Coway\u2019s current share price. Coway shares were 0.9% higher.\n\nWoongjin Thinkbig shares were up 15% at 0232 GMT, while Netmarble shares were flat.\n\nBuying a stake in Woongjin Coway, which rents water purifiers, air purifiers and bidets in South Korea, should help generate stable cash flow for the gaming firm, analysts said, but some questioned the potential for further synergies.\n\nNetmarble has said it is aiming for stable growth by using its cloud computing and big data technology to make Coway a global business offering subscription services and products.\n\nWoongjin Coway has operations in China and Southeast Asia, but its primary focus is on the South Korean market.\n\nAhn Jae-min, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities, pointed to the different customer profiles for gaming and home appliance rentals.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to picture synergies between gaming and rental businesses, and the gaming business is more individually focused than home appliances,\u201d Ahn said.\n\nThe proposed purchase would be Netmarble\u2019s first major deal this year since a $16 billion deal to buy crosstown gaming rival Nexon (3659.T) collapsed in July.\n\nWoongjin Group had announced in June that it planned to sell a 25.08% stake in Woongjin Coway, just three months after the group regained control of the unit for 1.89 trillion won ($1.6 billion).\n\nWoongjin Thinkbig bought a 22.17% stake in Woongjin Coway in March from South Korean private equity firm MBK Partners for 1.69 trillion won, nearly six years after the group had sold the unit. It subsequently bought an additional stake worth about 200 billion won.", "description": "South Korean gaming firm Netmarble <251270.KS> was chosen the preferred bidder for a 25% stake in water purifier rental firm Woongjin Coway <021240.KS> valued at $1.3 billion, sending shares in Woongjin's top shareholder higher.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440579551&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D078", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
