Dan Crenshaw (also Newsweek\u2019s absurd coverage)", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Dan Crenshaw was confronted by a handful of progressive veterans who bill themselves as \u201cCommon Defense,\u201d an anti-Trump group. As you can see in the clip they posted yesterday, their basic strategy was to follow Rep. Crenshaw down the hall as he was on his way to a vote and urge him to turn on the president. The guy doing most of the talking keeps rambling and doesn\u2019t let up.\n\n\u201cWe need your leadership right now. How can you be complicit in this man\u2019s crimes? It is immoral. It\u2019s laid out clearly in the Mueller report,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Crenshaw tried to get a word in but his pursuer just kept talking over him.\n\n\u201cAs a fellow wounded veteran, how can you let him take us into another war?\u201d another member of the group asked.\n\n\u201cWhat war is he taking us into?\u201d Crenshaw asked while the first guy continued talking over him.\n\n\u201cIran,\u201d the second guy replied.\n\nMeanwhile, the first guy is getting himself more worked up. His voice is getting louder: \u201cHow are you going to just let him lock kids in cages? Like, come on, dude!\u201d\n\nCrenshaw turned, looked directly at him and replied, \u201cYou need to calm down.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you kidding me?!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Crenshaw said.\n\n\u201cYou need to get your courage back. C\u2019mon,\u201d the first guy said.\n\n\u201cCourage? You\u2019re going to talk to me about courage?\u201d Crenshaw replied as the man kept talking over him.\n\nFinally, Crenshaw reached a members-only elevator. As the first guy kept up the shouting, Crenshaw replied, \u201cYou haven\u2019t made one actual point.\u201d\n\n\u201cRead the Meuller report!\u201d the guy shouted back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read the Mueller report. Have you?\u201d Crenshaw replied.\n\nWhen the elevator opened, Crenshaw got on. The first guy hesitated and then got on with him. Crenshaw pointed out the elevator was reserved for Members of Congress. \u201cYou got to make your video. You didn\u2019t come here to have a conversation,\u201d Crenshaw said. The first guy wouldn\u2019t leave so Crenshaw pushed a button to close the door. Another member of the group pulled the door open and got on the elevator with the camera.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to let a criminal get away with our democracy,\u201d the first guy continued.\n\n\u201cYou repeating things is not a conversation,\u201d Crenshaw replied.\n\nFinally, the doors opened and Crenshaw left the elevator. The first guy continued shouting about democracy at his back.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened. You can see it for yourself in the clip below. But here\u2019s how it was \u201creported\u201d by Newsweek in a story headlined \u201cGOP REP. DAN CRENSHAW TRIES TO HIDE IN ELEVATOR WHILE CONFRONTED BY COMBAT VETERANS OVER HIS SUPPORT FOR TRUMP: \u2018DO YOUR DUTY'\u201d\n\nRepublican congressman Dan Crenshaw unsuccessfully tried to lose two combat veterans by ducking into a private elevator as they confronted him about his support for President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. on Thursday\u2026 \u201cYou got to make your video. You didn\u2019t come here to have a conversation,\u201d Crenshaw said as he held the elevator open and gestured for Hurd to leave. \u201cAs veterans we should be smarter about how we talk about things.\u201d The congressman attempted to close the elevator door with Hurd still inside, but Pitts quickly reopened it. Crenshaw then left the elevator without riding it and stormed away.\n\nFirst of all, Crenshaw didn\u2019t try to \u201chide\u201d in the elevator and he didn\u2019t leave the elevator without riding it as Newsweek claims. Crenshaw clearly gets off on a different floor than the one he got on and continues to where he was going. But I guess that doesn\u2019t make for as juicy a headline.\n\nWhat I see in this clip is one loud guy shouting at Crenshaw and talking over him (and his buddies) while another guy shoots a video. Crenshaw, not surprisingly, wasn\u2019t interested in being shouted at by someone who clearly didn\u2019t want to have a dialogue and continued on his way. This elevator stunt may have worked on Jeff Flake but it didn\u2019t work on Dan Crenshaw.\n\nGOP Rep @DanCrenshawTX hid in an elevator today when combat vets confronted him about his support for Donald Trump. We\u2019re standing up for our democracy and holding Trump's cronies accountable.

Crenshaw was right. You guys simply wanted to make a video. Nice try. \u2014 Rich Weinstein (@phillyrich1) September 20, 2019\n\nThis is exactly what the video shows. You all did not want to talk but to hurl crafted accusations to try to force a response to paint him in a bad light. I am surprised Dan have you the time that he did. \u2014 Daniel Anderson (@ordoincendium) September 20, 2019", "description": "\"Like, come on, dude!\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Crenshaw-elevator.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
