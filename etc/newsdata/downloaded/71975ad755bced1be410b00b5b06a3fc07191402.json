However, when it comes to the national hard seltzer craze, the Midwest has proven itself as a definitive taste-maker.\n\nSanjiv Gajiwala, senior vice president of marketing at White Claw, told Business Insider in August that the drink is performing strongly across the nation, noting there \"aren't necessarily pockets where it's over-indexing the rest of the country\" and \"it's doing just as well in Montana as it is in Boston.\" Still, there appears to be overwhelming interest in the beverage and its related content \u2014 including \"Claw is the law\" memes and the popular Trevor Wallace satire video \"*drinks White Claw once*\"\u2014 in the Midwest as opposed to other regions.\n\nRead more: We taste-tested hard seltzer from 9 popular brands and ranked them from worst to best\n\nAccording to a recent analysis by The Daring Kitchen\u2014 which examined 200,000 geotagged tweets that mentioned White Claw during the months of July and August \u2014 six of the top 10 states hailed from the Midwest, with Ohio leading the pack.\n\nThe Daring Kitchen\n\nOhio also took the top spot on Google Trends for search queries of White Claw in the past 90 days on both desktop and mobile, with fellow Midwestern states Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, and Illinois rounding out the remaining top five spots.\n\nFurther, Ohio also reigned supreme in Google Trends searches for Truly, a White Claw competitor, though the rest of the list deviates slightly to include Delaware, South Dakota, Maine, and Arizona.\n\nA search for Bon & Viv yielded Maryland as the top state, though mirrored search patterns for White Claw and Truly in that the rest of the top five is from the Midwest.\n\nWill the hard seltzer trend continue? Only time (and perhaps Google analytics) will tell.", "description": "Ohio topped the list in both an analysis of 200,000 geotagged tweets that mentioned White Claw during July and August, as well as on Google Trends.", "authors": ["Bethany Biron"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7015892e22af5958034469-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
