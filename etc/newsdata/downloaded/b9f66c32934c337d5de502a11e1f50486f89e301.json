Hunter served on the board until early 2019.\n\nAt the time, a news release from the company said Hunter would be \"in charge of the Holdings' legal unit and will provide support for the Company among international organizations.\"\n\nHunter told the New York Times that the news release was not accurate and he was never in charge of the company's legal affairs.\n\nHe joined the company about a month after Russia annexed Crimea, a cataclysmic moment that continues to put the US at odds with Russia and is linked to ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDuring his time with Burisma, Hunter reportedly received compensation up to $50,000 a month.\n\nFrom the start, Hunter's role at Burisma was criticized by ethics watchdogs as a conflict of interest for his father, who was still vice president at the time and heavily focused on pressuring Ukraine to do a better job rooting out corruption. But some ethics watchdogs at the time also said that unless there was clear evidence Hunter got the job to influence US foreign policy then there was no cause for concern.\n\nHis hiring by Burisma was seen as an attempt by the company to bolster its image and the perception it had strong ties to the US as the world vilified Russia for its annexation of Crimea, the Times reported.\n\nYoshiko M. Herrera, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and an an expert on Russia and Eurasia, told The Washington Post: \"I think there is a conflict of interest even if it doesn't break any laws. It's a big deal. It's the vice president, who is the point person of the Obama administration's policy on Ukraine, and his son is suddenly hired to be a director on the board of Ukraine's largest private gas producer.\"\n\nWith that said, Hunter has never been accused of wrongdoing regarding his work with Burisma.\n\nHunter also said he only had one brief conversation with his father about Burisma which did not go into substantive details about the deal. Joe Biden has said he learned about his son's role at the company from news reports.\n\nHere's why this is now linked to a whistleblower complaint that's reportedly about Trump and a conversation with Ukraine's recently elected president:", "description": "Burisma Holdings is among Ukraine's largest independent natural gas companies, and it's now linked to a whistleblower scandal tied to President Trump.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d88fdd22e22af198052ae95?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
