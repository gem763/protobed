Adam Schiff, \u201cDo Nothing Democrats\u201d and a new book claiming the president once mused about digging a snake- and alligator-filled moat along the Mexican border.\n\nBriefing Finnish reporters later Wednesday, Mr. Niinisto insisted that serious issues had been discussed during the leaders\u2019 private bilateral talks, including an airing of Mr. Trump\u2019s take of the state of U.S.-European relations.\n\n\u201cWe heard some rather harsh words, as we also did in the press event,\u201d Mr. Niinisto said, according to a Helsinki Times report. \u201cThat\u2019s why I decided beforehand that I\u2019d bring up the topic of trans-Atlantic relations. At least he didn\u2019t reject the views that I expressed in that regard.\u201d\n\nThe center-right prime minister, who has been in office since 2012, attracted intense scrutiny on social media as he appeared mostly quietly beside Mr. Trump for two combative sessions with reporters.\n\nMany commentators said the Finnish leader was offering some subtle criticism of Mr. Trump when at one point he remarked, \u201cMr. President, you have a great democracy \u2014 keep it going.\u201d\n\nSome heard the remark as a harmless platitude, but others heard it as a dig.\n\n\u201cIs he subtweeting Trump to his face?\u201d asked Daniel Drezner, a professor at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.\n\nMr. Niinisto appears to have a talent for generating memorable remarks from Mr. Trump. The U.S. president cited his Finnish counterpart as the source for his theory that raking the forest floor was a way to prevent wildfires.\n\nOn a visit to the deadly California Camp fire of November 2018, Mr. Trump cited a conversation in which Mr. Niinisto had told him that Finland, as \u201ca forest nation,\u201d spent \u201ca lot of time raking and cleaning and doing things. And they don\u2019t have any problem\u201d with major fires.\n\nMr. Niinisto later told a Finnish newspaper he and Mr. Trump did discuss forest management briefly but did not recall mentioning raking.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
