The FT said the prime minister has a \u201cfighting chance\u201d to get the deal through the House of Commons \u2014 even without having to compromise on the Customs Union or holding a second referendum.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg and foreign secretary Dominic Raab are confident that deal will pass. While the government may lose the support of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), insiders have said the WAB has garnered backing from some Labour rebels and several expelled Tory MPs. Members of the influential Conservative European Reseach Group (ERG) \u2014 the Spartans \u2014 are also said to have backed down over their clean-break Brexit stance and are willing to \u201cchoke down our pride and vote in the national interest\u201d.\n\nEven if the government wins both votes on Tuesday, the bill will be further subject to votes on amendments which could frustrate Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans. However, the FT\u2018s analysis suggests Remainer MPs may fail in their endeavours as politics in parliament has shifted.\n\nThe newspaper predicts that a vote on an amendment forcing the UK into a customs union with the EU would be defeated by a more considerable margin than when a similar motion was previously defeated, then by a slim margin of three. Likewise, the last time a vote on holding a second referendum was held, it lost by one, with the FT predicting this time around, it could lose as many as 41.\n\nEven if projections are correct, MPs may vote down the three-day timetable on claims that it does not allow for enough scrutiny. Mr Rees-Mogg has warned that if lawmakers reject the intensive schedule, the UK will not leave the EU on time.\n\n\u201cPeople who do not vote for the programme motion will not be voting for Brexit on October 31,\u201d Mr Rees-Mogg reminded MPs.\n\nIf the bill fails, the default legal position is leaving without a deal; however, the Benn Act forced the prime minister to ask the EU for an extension last Saturday. Europeans are reserving their decision on the extension until further developments from London.", "description": "Analysts predict MPs could back Johnson's bill, with the PM pushing to have all legislation passed to allow for Brexit by October 31st.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Boris-Johnson-2-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
