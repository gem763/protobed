REUTERS/Saliou Samb\n\nProtesters chanted \u201cAmoulanfe\u201d - \u201cIt will not happen\u201d in the local Susu language - and \u201cFree the prisoners\u201d on their way to the capital Conakry\u2019s largest stadium.\n\nThe march was organised by the National Front for the Defence of the Constitution (FNDC), a coalition of politicians and activists opposed to a constitutional change that could let Conde seek a third term.\n\nThe peaceful, albeit heavily policed, protests were held in number of cities across the West African country.\n\nGuinea, with a population of nearly 13 million, is Africa\u2019s biggest bauxite producer and is host to international mining companies.\n\nOn Tuesday, twelve FNDC leaders were sentenced to up to a year in prison for organising previous rallies in which nine people were killed. Last week, police opened fire on protesters as they ransacked military posts and blocked roads.\n\n\u201cWe want him (Conde) to free the jailed leaders before any negotiation happens. Then Alpha needs to say he will not be a candidate,\u201d Algassimou Diallo, who marched in Conakry wearing the rally\u2019s official red colour, told Reuters.\n\nEighty-one-year-old Conde, whose second and final five-year term expires next year, has refused to rule out running again and asked his government last month to look into drafting a new constitution.\n\nHis opponents fear that could be used as a reset button on his presidency, allowing him to run again like other African leaders who have amended or changed constitutions in recent years to stay in power.\n\nConde\u2019s first election victory in 2010 raised hopes for democratic progress in Guinea after two years of military rule and nearly a quarter of a century under authoritarian President Lansana Conte, who died in 2008.\n\nBut his critics accuse him of cracking down on dissent and violently repressing protests - charges he denies.", "description": "Thousands took to the streets of Guinea on Thursday in the largest of a series of protests over a suspected effort by President Alpha Conde to seek a third term that have led to the jailing of a dozen opposition campaigners and politicians.", "authors": ["Saliou Samb", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444536778&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1FT-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
