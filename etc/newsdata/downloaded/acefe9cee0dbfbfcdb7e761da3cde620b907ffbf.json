(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nKentucky senator Rand Paul, perhaps the most prominent non-interventionist in Congress, said in 2015 that the United States should defeat ISIS by arming the Kurds and promising the Kurds their own country: \u201cI think they would fight like hell if we promised them a country.\u201d\n\nThe Kurds did indeed fight like hell, dying by the thousands in the fight against ISIS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Senator Paul is cheering on President Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the Kurds:\n\nI stand with @realDonaldTrump today as he once again fulfills his promises to stop our endless wars and have a true America First foreign policy. \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) October 7, 2019\n\nAs National Review\u2019s editorial notes, President Trump is not withdrawing all U.S. troops from Syria, but merely moving 100 or so U.S. troops to enable Turkey\u2019s attack on America\u2019s Kurdish allies. The Washington Post reports Turkey\u2019s invasion could allow 11,000 ISIS prisoners in Kurdish territory to run free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if you\u2019re a principled non-interventionist, how does abandoning the Kurds advance the national interest? A key objective of non-interventionism is relying on allies to fight our enemies, so America doesn\u2019t get bogged down in wars. What lesson will this betrayal send to existing and potential allies, now and in the future?\n\nAnd is potentially letting 11,000 ISIS prisoners run free so we can move 100 U.S. troops really what principled non-interventionism looks like? If it\u2019s not, will the principled non-interventionists please speak up?", "description": "Even if you\u2019re a principled non-interventionist, how does abandoning the Kurds advance the national interest?", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
