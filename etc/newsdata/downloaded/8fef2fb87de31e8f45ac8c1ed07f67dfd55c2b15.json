It\u2019s part of a growing tradition of right-wing fearmongering \u2014 what Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews referred to last year as \u201capocalypse punditry\u201d \u2014 that moves easily from the online fever swamps to the Oval Office and back again.\n\nSo it wasn\u2019t surprising \u2014 though it was deeply troubling \u2014 to see President Trump tweet a warning from a pastor on Sunday night of \u201ca Civil War like fracture in this Nation\u201d should he be removed from office.\n\nInvoking civil war \u2014 even indirectly \u2014 was once a third rail of modern American presidential rhetoric. Though Mr. Trump in the past has openly toyed with illiberal notions (ignoring term limits, not accepting election results should he lose), his casual suggestion that his ouster might lead to bloodshed felt like uncharted territory.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that we\u2019re not on the brink of a civil war ; the threat as outlined by right-wing media is intended to inspire fear in liberals and conservatives alike. For conservatives, it\u2019s the notion that Democrats will stop at nothing to get rid of Mr. Trump and will marshal the forces of the \u201cdeep state\u201d to right the wrongs of the 2016 election. For liberals, it is a warning: Don\u2019t push churchgoing, gun-loving conservatives too far, or there\u2019ll be dangerous consequences.", "description": "What began as trollish shorthand for political polarization has gone mainstream.", "authors": ["Charlie Warzel"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/opinion/30warzel_illo/30warzel_illo-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
