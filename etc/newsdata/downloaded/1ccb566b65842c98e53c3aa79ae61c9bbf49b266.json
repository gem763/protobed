When the results appeared, my jaw dropped with cartoonish effect. Of nearly 30,000 participants, 52 percent said a tennis ball is green, 42 percent said it\u2019s yellow, and 6 percent went with \u201cother.\u201d\n\nI was stunned. I\u2019d gone from being so sure of myself to second-guessing my sanity in a matter of seconds. More than that, I could never have imagined the question of the color of a tennis ball\u2014surely something we could all agree on, even in these times\u2014would be so divisive.\n\nI dropped the tweet into my team\u2019s Slack channel, which includes The Atlantic\u2019s science, technology, and health reporters and editors. The long conversation that followed can only be described as a bloodbath.\n\nThe seemingly trivial question tore apart our usually congenial group. Lines were quickly and fiercely drawn, team green against team yellow, as my colleagues debated the very definition of color itself. Swords were brandished in the form of links to HTML color codes or the paint selection at Sherwin-Williams. Attempts to broker a cease-fire, to consider that maybe tennis balls are actually yellow-green\u2014or green-yellow, or chartreuse\u2014were brushed aside. At one point, I lashed out at a colleague who then reminded me we were on the same side.\n\nThe battle cries eventually subsided, but the war wasn\u2019t over. The next morning, I arrived at the office to find a tube of tennis balls sitting on my desk in a mafia-style warning. They looked green.\n\nWhen I voted in the Twitter poll, using only my memory of a tennis ball, tennis balls were yellow. Now, they were green. I wasn\u2019t sure anymore. I wasn\u2019t sure of anything anymore.\n\nAn investigation was in order. It began with the most obvious first stop, Wikipedia. \u201cTennis balls are fluorescent yellow at major sporting events, but in recreational play can be virtually any color,\u201d the page for tennis balls said. And it\u2019s true. A quick spin through Amazon shows that tennis balls, at least according to the labels, come in yellow and green and purple and even pink with Hello Kitty\u2019s face on them.\n\nNext, I turned to the official governing body of tennis around the world, the International Tennis Federation. According to the ITF, tennis balls were once actually white or black. The arrival of television changed that. Viewers had trouble seeing tennis balls as they hurled across the court in televised matches, so the ITF instructed tournaments to start using yellow ones in 1972 (though white ones were still allowed). The new rule said \u201cthe ball shall have a uniform outer surface consisting of a fabric cover and shall be white or yellow in color.\u201d Cool history, but it didn\u2019t help explain why we all felt completely unmoored from reason and reality.\n\nSurely the suppliers of tennis balls could help. I reached out to a number of popular tennis-ball manufacturers, including Penn, Wilson, Dunlop, Gamma Sports, and Slazenger, as well as the sporting-goods stores Modell\u2019s and Dick\u2019s. Only Gamma Sports took my query seriously and responded. They put their answer in all caps: \u201cOPTIC YELLOW!\u201d (My colleagues who played tennis or had worked at tennis clubs\u2014the ones with the most experience in actually looking at tennis balls\u2014also thought they were yellow.)\n\nIt was time to consult the experts, so I emailed Bevil Conway, a researcher at the National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Eye Institute who studies color perception.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking at any tennis balls now, but I think they are yellow,\u201d Conway replied.\n\nHe then dove into the science behind his decision, taking our little investigation from the tennis aisle at Modell\u2019s and plunging it into the ever mysterious realm of human cognition and perception.\n\n\u201cI make this decision as much on the basis of what I think I know about tennis balls\u2014that they are yellow\u2014as I do on what color I recall that they looked when I last saw one,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, like the color of a lot of objects, how we label [a tennis ball] is determined both by perceptual and cognitive factors: the actual physical light entering your eye and ... knowledge about what people have typically labeled the objects.\u201d\n\nConway pointed to bananas as an example of this phenomenon. Bananas can be a number of colors\u2014green when they\u2019re not yet ripe, brown when we\u2019ve let them sit out for too long. But we label bananas yellow, and we do it because \u201cthis is their state when we care about them,\u201d Conway said. \u201cIt is canonical among most people to call bananas yellow.\u201d\n\nBy this logic, some people have internalized what they\u2019ve seen at major tournament events and on labels from tennis manufacturers and come to associate tennis balls with the color yellow. Sure, we understand that tennis balls could be made in other colors, but the state of tennis balls when we care about them\u2014such as when we watch a match on TV\u2014is yellow, so when we\u2019re asked to ascribe one color to them all, we go with that. As for why we haven\u2019t agreed on the color of tennis balls as we have for bananas, \u201cmaybe they haven\u2019t been around long enough, or the color of them has actually changed,\u201d Conway said. This makes sense. Bananas have been around far longer than tennis balls.\n\nThe tennis gods picked yellow for the color of tennis balls because they thought yellow was bright enough for people to see it with ease. And that\u2019s true, but just because something is highly visible to the eye doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy for us to describe it. Red, green, blue, and yellow are \u201cunique hues,\u201d colors that human vision perceives as pure, rather than a mix of two or more. Among these hues, \u201cyellow is the most precisely identified across people,\u201d Conway said. \u201cIf you ask people to pick out \u2018yellow\u2019 in the spectrum (a color that is neither red nor green), pretty much everyone identifies the same wavelength.\u201d\n\nThis shows that people can easily distinguish yellow from other colors. But how that yellow should be described is another question. \u201cYellow presents an interesting paradox: It is easy to discriminate, but we don\u2019t name it as well as we name other colors like red and orange,\u201d Conway said.\n\nIn other words, humans are good at pointing at a yellow paint chip in a line of colorful chips and saying, that\u2019s yellow. But if we\u2019re shown a yellow paint chip alone and asked what color it is, we become less certain about calling it yellow. In a recent study Conway coauthored that surveyed people who speak three different languages\u2014American English, Bolivian Spanish, and an Amazonian language called Tsimane\u2014researchers found that \u201clanguage systems of people in cultures with little exposure to industrialization are pretty poor at communicating yellow.\u201d\n\nAnd what about green? \u201cWe are generally really bad, across all cultures, in communicating green,\u201d Conway said.\n\nGreat.\n\n\u201cI can think of many more orange or red objects\u2014apples, tomatoes, cherries, most fruit, faces, etc. So it might not be surprising that there is some disagreement about the color of tennis balls,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are an odd color, designed to be odd so that they are especially visible on the court. But because they are odd, we haven\u2019t resolved how to label them.\u201d\n\nThe discussion over tennis balls began to resemble another color-related debate: the question of The Dress. You know the one. For what felt like months in 2015, the picture of a dress bitterly divided the internet. In one camp were the people who saw the dress as black and blue, in the other those who saw it as gold and white. Could there be a connection between the way some people perceive the color of tennis balls and the color of The Dress?\n\nBack in 2015, Conway and other experts explained that the difference of opinion about The Dress stemmed from the way the human brain evolved to perceive light (they\u2019ve since fleshed out the theory in a recent paper). We experience all kinds of warm and cool light throughout the day. We get warm light from sunsets and incandescent bulbs, and blue light from overcast skies and computer screens, to name a few.\n\nWhen we\u2019re looking at a given object in different types of light, our brains make substantial color corrections that allow us to see the object in a stable color over most lighting conditions. Conway\u2019s theory is that some people discount cool colors in their perception, while others discount warm colors, in order to view objects consistently as the light changes around them. When people discount the blue\u2014a cool color\u2014of The Dress, they end up seeing white and gold. When they discount the gold\u2014a warm color\u2014they see blue and black.\n\nIf the same effect is true for our perception of tennis balls, then the people who see the dress as white and gold, because they are predisposed to discounting cool colors, should see the ball as yellow. Meanwhile, those who see the dress and blue and black, because they discount warm colors, should see the ball as green.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly the effect we found, according to a quick, very informal survey of my Slack team. Aside from one or two outliers, those who believe a tennis ball is yellow saw the dress as gold and white, while those who believe a tennis ball is green saw the dress as black and blue. Minds blown.\n\nConway took it a step further, suggesting that the way people see tennis balls could reveal something about their lifestyles. Night owls, for example, spend most of their time under artificial, warm light, which means they\u2019d discount warm colors and see a tennis ball as green. Early birds, on the other hand, get plenty of exposure to blue daylight, which means they would discount cool colors and see a tennis ball as yellow. \u201cI\u2019d emphasize that this is just a theory, and we\u2019d need lots of data to support it before I\u2019d believe it were true,\u201d Conway said.\n\nThis is where my investigation ends, and I turn the question to you, dear reader. What color is a tennis ball? We\u2019ve reported, now you decide. I must warn you that pondering this may lead you, as it did us, toward an existential cliff where we were reminded, once more, though we all live in the same world, it can look completely different to different people. \u201cThe reason color is so compelling is that it is a computation of the brain, but one that is so good that we think it is an objective property of the world,\u201d Conway said. \u201cExperiences that make it impossible to ignore the role of the brain in how we compute color are therefore very disconcerting.\u201d\n\nHere at The Atlantic, the great tennis-ball debate eventually tapered off. We lowered our weapons and sort of calmed down. But there would be no consensus. Yes, we would move on, continue working alongside each other, but we would hold onto our allegiances, team green and team yellow, like coats of armor. The color of a tennis ball is, and would remain, in the eye of the beholder.\n\nMy colleague Julie Beck summed up the ordeal with a sentiment we could all agree with. \u201cIt is truly horrifying every time it gets pointed out that we\u2019re all walking around thinking we share the same reality,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we just are not.\u201d\n\n", "description": "An investigation into a surprisingly divisive question.", "authors": ["Rachel Strohm", "Nana Salaudeen", "Jitesh Patel", "\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0627\u062c\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u06cc", "Shipra", "Kevin Munc", "Cinthia Panayotti", "Arshad Pooloo", "Mike Carlson", "Kessa Turnbull"], "top_image": "https://pocket-image-cache.com/2000x/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.theatlantic.com%2Fassets%2Fmedia%2Fimg%2Fmt%2F2018%2F02%2FRTX4AEDS%2Flead_720_405.jpg%3Fmod%3D1533691924", "published_at": "2018-02-19"}
