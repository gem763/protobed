The Borussia Dortmund winger seized the moment he had begged for.\n\nGareth Southgate praises Raheem Sterling but worried by defensive errors Read more\n\nSouthgate had suggested the 19-year-old\u2019s gifts go under the radar in England as they light up the Bundesliga on a regular basis and not the Premier League. That view must be revised after his impact on a chaotic evening in Southampton. This was Sterling\u2019s night, with the Manchester City forward delivering another supreme show of devastating creativity, but Sancho drew inspiration from his former club colleague. \u201cHe was in my room at 10.30 last night begging me to square one,\u201d Sterling revealed afterwards. He squared two to help Sancho \u2013 at 19 years and 169 days \u2013 become the youngest player to score more than once in a game for England since Wayne Rooney against Croatia in 2004. The standing ovation he received when replaced by Marcus Rashford late on confirmed he flies under no one\u2019s radar in England any more. Here he brought a potency to the England attack that the Manchester United forward, for all his qualities, is yet to translate on to the international stage. The contest between the two should make for compelling viewing in the build-up to Euro 2020.\n\nSouthgate ranked Rashford, Sterling and Harry Kane among the finest forward lines in international football after the defeat of Bulgaria on Saturday, when their varying attributes again coalesced into a potent unit. But with only seven matches remaining before having to name his squad for the Euros \u2013 it is probably now safe to say England will be present \u2013 the strongest opponent in a weak group was an ideal opportunity to test the resources at his disposal.\n\n\u201cIt is in no way a reflection of how people played at the weekend,\u201d the England manager explained before kick-off. \u201cJadon Sancho is in to freshen up the team. We have good players to come in and it\u2019s a chance in the wide areas to refresh the group. His ability one against one to beat players [and] his decision making is excellent. His number of goals and assists at Dortmund speaks for itself.\u201d Speaks loudly, in fact. No player in Europe\u2019s top five leagues has produced more assists in league football than Sancho since the start of last season. His total of 17 includes four in five appearances for Borussia Dortmund this term. As well as three goals.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jadon Sancho thanks Raheem Sterling for a promise fulfilled.

He immediately looked a natural fit in a settled forward line and took up positions that Southgate wants to see Rashford occupy more regularly; that is less time dropping deep in search of possession and more looking to get in behind defenders with pace that, allied to Sterling\u2019s speed and skill on the opposite flank, enabled the hosts to recover convincingly from Keane\u2019s first-minute aberration. Sancho would also drift centrally in close support of Kane at times as England exhausted the Kosovo defence with their movement and clinical finishing.\n\nJadon Sancho the difference as blunders mar England\u2019s 5-3 win against Kosovo Read more\n\nIt took a while for a rapport to build between the former Watford academy graduate and Trent Alexander-Arnold on what could be a hugely productive right flank for England. Twice the Liverpool right-back failed to pick out a Sancho run into space in the first half but with Jordan Henderson quick to find the winger he did not have to wait long to showcase the ability to burst past defenders and pick the right pass having done so. Florent Hadergjonaj, the poor Kosovan left-back, was in a state of torment long before Sancho scored his first international goal on the stroke of half-time. Receiving Sterling\u2019s inch-perfect pass across the penalty area, the 19-year-old again deceived Hadergjonaj before firing low under Arijanet Muric. The immaculate control and quick change of feet in possession prior to converting were hallmarks of Sancho\u2019s entire performance. His willingness to help defensively did not go unnoticed too, and he intercepted several breaks by Kosovo when sprinting back into midfield.\n\nSancho won the corner that led to Keane\u2019s reprieve and Sterling\u2019s equaliser. He forced England\u2019s third by taking the ball to the byline, outfoxing Hadergjonaj and driving in a low cross that Muric inexplicably left and Mergim Vojvoda turned into his own net. The fact it was an own goal and a Kosovan player was flat on the ground appealing for treatment at the time barely registered with Sancho as he celebrated with a few fist-pumps.\n\nHe looked more sheepish after scoring his second goal. Once again it was made by the mesmerising and unselfish feet of Sterling and Sancho was left with a simple task to score into an empty goal with Muric stranded. Sterling had fulfilled his promise and Southgate\u2019s options in attack, with Callum Hudson-Odoi still to recover from injury, look increasingly formidable.", "description": "Jadon Sancho begged Raheem Sterling to set him up for his first England goal then delivered with two on a night when he gave the attack an extra dimension", "authors": ["Andy Hunter"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e239d486df77d89e31be84f71e3cc960c48500a0/0_155_3870_2323/master/3870.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d7ff0d1b034f9382e4fd3cf10eecd8e6", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
