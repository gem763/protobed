It was 16.8 percent in March of 2010. And it dropped to 7.8 percent; a 54 percent reduction under President Obama. And Trump\u2026while this was happening, denied that it was even happening. He called the numbers \u2018fake news;\u2019 until he came into office, and suddenly all the numbers he said were fake were magically real. And so, he took credit for the momentum that\u2026has occurred since that time. \u201cSo we have 8.9 percent in the Obama presidency, and down by 2.5 percent in this presidency. As you said, it is good news. It is a good trend. But it didn\u2019t start under this president, and the numbers actually declined much stronger under the former president.\u201d\n\nWell there ya go.\n\nPlus, racism.\n\nHere\u2019s what Keith believes black people think:\n\n\u201cI think the message is something that does not resonate with black communities and brown communities simply because of the rhetoric that has come out of the White House.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nTo what rhetoric was he referring?\n\nApparently, some Klannish stuff from that guy who spits in the face of non-whites:\n\n\u201cAnd so, I think I said almost two years ago to the day on this program, that if someone spits in your face and then hands you a napkin, you don\u2019t get to say \u2018Thank you.'\u201d\n\nDon seemed to really like that.\n\nGo sour, Lemon:\n\n\u201cAs you say, if someone spits in your face and hands you a napkin, how\u2026what is that supposed to\u2026I don\u2019t understand that argument. Does that mean that the only part of your brain, or the only part of our being that matters is money? Rather than how someone treats you and what someone says about you?\u201d\n\nWhat has Donald Trump said about the black race?\n\nOh, here it is; Don posed the following question:\n\n\u201cHow do black voters in 2020 weight these unemployment numbers against the President\u2019s racist behavior [indecipherable]\u2013 Charlottesville, slamming Baltimore, \u2018rodent infested,\u2019 and, you know, go on and on?\u201d\n\nHas Baltimore become the black race? Is it racist to criticize that particular city or refer to a rodent infestation? If so, watch Democrats \u2014 including the city\u2019s black mayor \u2014 do racist things here, here, and here.\n\nStrange new definition, though; here\u2019 s the old one: the judging of an individual solely by his or her race.\n\nRegardless, the President \u2014 it sounds like \u2014 has done nothin\u2019 good.\n\nKeith pressed harder, in case you missed it the first time:\n\n\u201cDonald Trump had little to nothing to do with the drop in unemployment for African-Americans. No one can\u2026no one who talks about this in the Republican Party can cite a single policy contributed by Donald Trump that is responsible for the drop in black unemployment. It\u2019s all because of policies that \u2026 that started long ago. It wasn\u2019t the tax cut or anything like that. Policies started long ago in the Obama administration when we started to see the drop. And the other thing is that Obama had the good sense not to go out and brag about it every time that there was a drop in unemployment because he knew that it\u2019s still too high compared to the white unemployment rate.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s the news.\n\n-ALEX\n\nFind all my RedState work here.\n\nAnd please follow Alex Parker on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThank you for reading!
