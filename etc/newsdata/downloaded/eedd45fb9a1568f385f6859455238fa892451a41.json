But clearly, it was an amicable separation and they\u2019re friendly enough for Jen to click that follow button on Justin\u2019s account.\n\nFriends gang\u2019s all here (Picture: Jennifer Aniston, Instagram)\n\nIt was suggested that the former spouses were still on good terms when they reunited to mourn the loss of their beloved dog Dolly back in July.\n\nSharing the heartbreaking news of Dolly\u2019s death, Justin posted a photo of he and a woman believed to be Jennifer holding hands at the pooch\u2019s funeral.\n\nJustin also alluded to Jennifer\u2019s presence at the wake, stating that Dolly was \u2018surrounded by her entire family\u2019 at the time of her passing.\n\nThe couple have barely spoken about their split publicly but said in their joint announcement that they still had \u2018deep respect\u2019 for each other.\n\n\u2018Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.\n\n\u2018Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else\u2019s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
