Trump announced that the temporary cease-fire between Turkey and the Kurdish forces in Syria has now been made permanent in a new agreement. Trump insisted that his decision to abruptly withdraw from the contested border areas created the opening for potential peace in the region.\n\n\u201cThis was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else. No other nation,\u201d Trump claimed, while blaming the countries in the region for involving us in their \u201cancient tribal conflicts.\u201d Declaring that his course will always be \u201cvictory for America,\u201d Trump said that he would ensure that American troops would only be deployed in the future in service to a \u201cvital national interest,\u201d and only when a path to victory is clearly defined:\n\nPresident Trump says Turkey will make its ceasefire in Syria permanent, and U.S. sanctions on Turkey will be lifted \"unless something happens that we're not happy with\" https://t.co/OYFwIl29dZ pic.twitter.com/k225tG4gaS \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) October 23, 2019\n\nEven if the ceasefire collapses, Trump noted, we won\u2019t come back. \u201cLet someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand,\u201d Trump declared, and called on other nations to do their part in policing peace. That has its own implications for the region; which nations will fill the vacuum left behind the US withdrawal? Do we really want Iran and/or Russia becoming the policeman in the region? Saudi Arabia already has enough of Iran playing policeman in Yemen and parts of Syria, and Jordan and Israel won\u2019t much care for that idea either.\n\nHowever, this is entirely consistent with Trump\u2019s election campaign rhetoric. In fact, this speech sounded almost like a sequel to his 2016 agenda, with claims of progress and determination to get the rest of it accomplished. Clearly the criticism from both sides of the aisle over his Syria withdrawal has not dented Trump\u2019s resolve to see through his disengagement policies; it sounds more like he\u2019s doubling down and hoping to accelerate the process.\n\nThe government in Afghanistan is no doubt getting more nervous after this speech, and they should be. Whether the government in Ankara is at all nervous about Trump\u2019s threat of economic war as a consequence of violating the ceasefire remains to be seen, but I doubt the Kurds are anywhere near as grateful as Trump claimed.\n\nUpdate: Here are Trump\u2019s full remarks, but you need to skip to the -26:00 mark to get to them.\n\nUpdate: Trump said that Kurdish SDF commander General Mazloum would shortly issue a readout of their call in which he thanked Trump for forcing the Turks to end their attacks. Sure enough:\n\nGEN.Mazloum:\n\n2. We THANK President Trump for his tireless efforts that stopped the brutal Turkish attack and jihadist groups on our people. \u2014 Coordination & Military Ops Center \u2013 SDF (@cmoc_sdf) October 23, 2019", "description": "\"Let someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/trump-syria.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
