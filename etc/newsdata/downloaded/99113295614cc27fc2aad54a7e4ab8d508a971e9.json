You know who would never say that? Cher. And Cher would never want you to say that, either. So how could we ever refuse an opportunity to share with you this incredible achievement in television history, this three-minute justification for why Technicolor even exists. Thursday night, on what was apparently the America\u2019s Got Talent finale, Cher was a one-woman embodiment of the show\u2019s title when she surprised audiences with a joyous performance of ABBA\u2019s \u201cWaterloo.\u201d Terry Crews introduced her as \u201ca Grammy-winning singer, an Oscar-winning actress, an Emmy-winning TV star, and a fashion icon,\u201d which, we\u2019re watching you, Tonys! Do the right thing and make it an honest EGOT! Then Cher came out looking like a sugar-plum goddess in her plunging-neckline bell-bottom jumpsuit and reminded us what happiness feels like for the first time since the \u201cSuper Trouper\u201d segment at the end of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. (To fans of lesser films, this is the equivalent of Al Pacino performing a Godfather Part II monologue during the season finale of America\u2019s Best Dance Crew.) Ever the populist, Cher performed this same number \u2014 with the same bespangled Rainbow Brite backup dancers and everything \u2014 for a room full of celebrities and VIPs at this year\u2019s Met Gala.\n\nFun-fact corner: Speaking of the Met Gala, did you know that about a week after Cher performed \u201cWaterloo\u201d in the S*ckler Wing\u2019s Temple of Dendur, the Met finally announced that they will stop accepting gifts from the Sacklers? Cher\u2019s impact.\n\nThe performance is made all the more fun by the quick cuts to the panel of Simon Cowell, Howie Mandel, and Julianne Hough, all looking like a council of Bond villains. And to top it all off, there are glitter cannons. Glitter cannons! Cher also gave this charming interview, where she says she once held a plank for five minutes (\u201cIt\u2019s a bitch\u201d) and that she loves Wii Tennis. (\u201cIt\u2019s an active game, you\u2019re running all over the place, I like it.\u201d) If Wii Tennis and planking are Cher\u2019s fitness regimen, then we\u2019d like to offer our thanks to Nintendo.", "description": "On Thursday night\u2019s season finale of America\u2019s Got Talent, Cher was the true winner when she gave a performance of ABBA\u2019s Waterloo. It\u2019s the same song she performed at this year\u2019s Met Gala. The 73 year old singer also talks fitness with Simon Cowell.", "authors": ["Rebecca Alter"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/19/19-cher.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
