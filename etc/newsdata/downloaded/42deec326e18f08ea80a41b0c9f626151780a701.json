Of course, that\u2019s because the movie only played three theaters, forcing anyone who wanted to see it to shell out for 10:30 a.m. screenings \u2014 a bit of artificial scarcity the Park family could appreciate. If you\u2019re outside New York or L.A., you may have to wait a while to see what everyone\u2019s talking about: Neon is slow-playing the expansion, not taking the film nationwide until mid-November . Parasite is the distributor\u2019s priceless Faberg\u00e9 egg, and they\u2019re doing everything in their power not to drop it.\n\nEven\n\nJojo Rabbit\n\nAfter its Toronto premiere, I wrote about the furor I expected Jojo Rabbit to kick up. With Taika Waititi\u2019s Nazi comedy opening in limited release this week, that controversy has yet to materialize \u2014 maybe because we\u2019re all still burnt out from Joker, or maybe because, now that festival fever has settled down, critics\u2019 takes on Jojo have become slightly less polarized. Even A.O. Scott, who\u2019s cooler on the film than most, says \u201cthe spirit of the movie is too warm and the filmmaking intelligence too invigorating to provoke a strong objection.\u201d Muted praise, but for a movie that\u2019s trying to damper a potential backlash that may be just what the doctor ordered. We\u2019ll find out this weekend if audiences go as crazy for Jojo as they did at TIFF.", "description": "The Fox News sexual-harassment drama \u201cBombshell\u201d launched its first-look screenings last weekend, and the impact was palpable.", "authors": ["Nate Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/17/oscar-futures/17-oscar-futures-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
