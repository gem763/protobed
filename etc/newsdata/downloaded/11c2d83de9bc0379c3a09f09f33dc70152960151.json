The president also spoke about this minimum wage during the state of the nation address, so we cannot turn back.\u201d\n\nGodongwana told City Press that the elections manifesto was \u201cbut one of the documents\u201d that had to be implemented.\n\n\u201cThere are others, such as national conference resolutions. The Treasury document, as a number of commentators have alluded to, draws from a number of documents including the National Development Plan (NDP,) and the ANC statement confirms that.\u201d\n\nCity Press understands that Mantashe also disagreed with Mboweni on the sale of coal-fired stations, instead preferring for South Africa to look to clean coal technology to exploit its vast coal reserves.\n\nMantashe, according to those attending the meeting, said that coal provided the country with a strategic advantage in global economic markets and, despite agreement in the ANC that the non-core state assets could be ditched, coal could not just be tossed into private hands.\n\nThe submissions from the five ministers were set to be integrated pending further engagements at a planned Alliance Political Council, whose discussion document was already being circulated.\n\nRead: ANC backs parts of Mboweni\u2019s economic growth plan but says more discussions needed\n\nAlso persuaded by Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali, the meeting agreed to remove all labour market issues from the discussion and if government wanted to negotiate them, the discussions would be tabled at Nedlac, the business, labour and government negotiating chamber, for consideration.\n\n\u2018Ham-fisted approach\u2019\n\nCosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said Treasury\u2019s economic strategy \u201cdeviated fundamentally\u201d from the ANC 2019 elections manifesto.\n\n\u201cThis is not a matter that Cosatu, having participated in the manifesto\u2019s drafting, nor the workers who have voted overwhelmingly to defend and elect the ANC back into government, can take lightly or ignore,\u201d said Pamla.\n\nNetwerk24 Nellie Brand-Jonker\n\nThe trade union federation agreed that the economy was in a serious crisis, with the 40% and rising unemployment figure being the core of the problem.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe welcome debates on what must be done. However, the ham-fisted, bull-in-a-china-shop approach of Treasury will, in fact, make matters worse for workers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe national minimum wage was a key campaign feature of not only President Cyril Ramaphosa but the ANC, he said, adding that the Treasury proposal to exempt SMMEs would in effect collapse the 10-month-old legislation.\n\n\u201cThis, in reality, will render the national minimum wage irrelevant. Government\u2019s definition of SMMEs as companies with up to 200 employees is, in fact, the overwhelming majority of employers where the national minimum wage is relevant,\u201d said Pamla.\n\nNeither the National Minimum Wage Commission nor the workers had been consulted on this matter.\n\n\u201cIn short, government believes that the way to grow the economy is to pay workers a slave wage. If this bore any relation to reality, then South Africa with its inherited apartheid poverty wages would be enjoying 100% and not 40% unemployment rates.\u201d\n\nHe said another proposal on limiting the extension of bargaining council agreements amounted to exempting SMMEs from respecting the labour rights of workers.\n\nPamla said Mboweni\u2019s proposal on stabilising SOEs also went against the ANC\u2019s long-standing position, the manifesto and even Ramaphosa\u2019s continuous pronouncements.\n\nThe proposal to auction off Eskom\u2019s coal generation capacity, which accounted for 70% of Eskom\u2019s generation capacity, was in effect privatisation of the entity and it would lead to the complete collapse of Eskom and the nation\u2019s electricity certainty.\n\nHe said Cosatu would participate in the debate on how best to stabilise SOEs but with conditions, including that there would be \u201cno retrenchments, no privatisation\u201d and that \u201ccomprehensive forensic audits are conducted, the accused are arrested and stolen assets returned to the state\u201d.\n\n\n\nSACP spokesperson Alex Mashilo, who also presented the party\u2019s submissions on the economy at the NEC meeting, said it would be \u201cunethical\u201d to enter into the details of \u201cwho said what\u201d at the meeting.\n\n\u201cWhat we can say is that we welcome the agreement, as recorded in the post-NEC statement, to proceed with the convening of the Alliance Political Council process of consultation,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the central committee meeting last month the SACP dismissed the idea to \u201croll back the legally recognised extension of collective bargaining agreements\u201d.\n\nThe party said that the ANC\u2019s elections manifesto, developed in consultation with the alliance, was consequently taken to the electorate for endorsement on the ballot.\n\n\u201cIt is important to remain true to history and truthful to our people. The entire progressive thrust of the manifesto must be articulated consistently in policy making in government, rather than undermined.\u201d\n\nSmall business minister stands firm\n\nHowever, Ntshavheni said that in terms of current provisions for the national minimum wage, SMMEs had the right to apply for exemption from paying the minimum wage and if they met certain criteria, their application would be granted.\n\n\u201cThe current proposal is to make it easier and more efficient for qualifying SMMEs to receive exemptions from paying the national minimum wage (what is termed automatic exemptions),\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the current exemptions were given on a case-by-case basis, the proposal was to make the qualifying criteria for the national minimum wage exemption standard and its implementation automatic for qualifying SMMEs.\n\nShe said \u201cthere was never an intention to unilaterally exempt SMMEs from respecting labour rights, but a proposal of matters that should be tabled at Nedlac for negotiations and agreements\u201d.\n\nNtshavheni said the ANC and government already had a policy position on the sale of non-core and non-strategic state assets as espoused in the NDP.\n\nSpecific to the proposal of the sale of coal-fired power stations, she said, \u201cthe proposed Integrated Resource Plan of the mineral resources and energy department has necessitated a review of such a position\u201d.", "description": "Alliance partners kick against proposals to sell Eskom\u2019s coal-fired stations and exempt SMMEs from paying the national minimum wage.", "authors": ["Setumo Stone"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/b7315409934a4d85a943fdb475435aa1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
