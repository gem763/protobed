They are the youngest on the infamous mob groups. Boss Carmine Persico 'the Snake' died seven months ago at a North Carolina hospital near the federal prison where he was serving a 100-year sentence on charges of murder and racketeering. John 'Sonny' Franzese, 102, a reputed underboss for the Colombo crime family was 100 years old, the oldest prisoner in the federal penal system, when he was released in June 2017. He was once a regular at the Copacabana nightclub, where he could be seen with singers Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. The Gambinos were the most powerful of the five families of the New York City mafia and worth an estimated $500 million a year.\n\nFederal authorities say Bifalco first asked Amato Jr. if he should 'talk about this on the phone', NBC reports.\n\nAmato Jr. is said to have answered: 'I mean, why not?' 'You talk about everything else on the f***ing phone, and you're an idiot.'\n\nIn follow up calls Bifalco spoke of 'offering to pay thousands of dollars to multiple members of a basketball team so that they would intentionally lose by a lot', investigators say.\n\nCourt papers allege he then tried to convince Amato Jr. to put money on the unspecified game.\n\nBut, according to court documents, Amato Jr. wrote to fellow alleged Colombo family member, Thomas Scorcia, to say he would 'not touch the game'.\n\nHe is said to have written: 'Ok I wouldn't trust the game I was telling u about...I'm not touching it personally.'\n\nFederal prosecutors say that was 'good advice given that the favored team did not cover the spread and the bets would not have been winning ones'.\n\nFederal prosecutors say 11 members of the Colombo crime family were arrested Thursday. Nine others were also charged with crimes including racketeering and extortion across Staten Island since 2014.\n\nAmong those charged were Amato Sr., alleged family members Daniel Capaldo, Vincent Scura and Thomas Scorcia and associate Anthony Silvestro.\n\nThose charged are aged 21 to 60 years old and live in New Jersey or New York.\n\nCourt documents detail how Amato Jr. made threats toward a man who claimed that he insulted a woman at a local bar.\n\nAt the bar, Amato Jr. reportedly asked the man: 'Do you know who my father is?'\n\nOne of the items allegedly seized from Joseph Amato\u2019s home in May 2017.
