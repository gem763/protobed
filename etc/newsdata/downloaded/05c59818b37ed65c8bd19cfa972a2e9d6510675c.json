He lost the use of his arm for a year.\n\nMr. LaRuffa testified against Malvo and Muhammad at the original trials when Malvo was sentenced to life without parole and Muhammad got the death penalty, which was carried out in 2009.\n\n\u201cWith scientific evidence, he now has at hand, Paul understands there is a real difference in the brains, character and judgment of minors that causes them to act and react more on emotion rather than on reason. He also understands minors have a strong capacity for rehabilitation,\u201d Mr. LaRuffa\u2019s legal counsel said in a court filing.\n\nIsa Nichols, who was Muhammad\u2019s accountant, had her niece shot and killed by Malvo. She signed on to the court filing, saying she thinks Malvo was under the influence of Muhammad.\n\nAnd Cheryll Shaw, whose father was killed by the two men in spring 2002, has also asked the court to show mercy to Malvo.\n\nMalvo and Muhammad, who was an adult in his 40s, terrorized Washington with a series of random attacks at locations including schools, gas stations and grocery stores around the Beltway.\n\nSome people avoided going out except when absolutely necessary, and some gas stations took to hanging tarps around the pumps to keep customers from becoming targets. Schools were placed on lockdown and on one occasion, Interstate 95 was closed.\n\nThe sniper duo killed 12 people and wounded six, all while taunting police. They had drilled a hole in the trunk of their car just above the license plate so they could fire from undercover, then drive off, eluding authorities and prolonging the terror for weeks.\n\nMuhammad had brought Malvo from Jamaica to the U.S. illegally and became a father figure to the teen.\n\nMalvo was convicted of murdering one woman, and he pleaded guilty to the murder and attempted murder of two other individuals in Virginia. He also pleaded guilty to six murders in Maryland.\n\nHe has been serving his life sentence at Red Onion State Prison in Wise County, Virginia.\n\nThat\u2019s where he should stay, said Nelson Rivera, whose wife Lori Ann Lewis-Rivera was shot and killed by Malvo at a Shell gas station in Kensington, Maryland.\n\nMr. Rivera and his legal team told the high court that any move to show mercy for Malvo will harm the victims by denying them \u201cfinality, fairness, and dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cVictims\u2019 lives and pain can never be restored to their prior state and they have a right not to have to, unnecessarily, reopen and relive the nightmare of their loss at re-sentencing proceedings,\u201d Mr. Rivera, represented by the Maryland Crime Victims\u2019 Resource Center, said in court documents.\n\nMalvo, now 34, has challenged his sentence, saying subsequent Supreme Court precedent dictates a juvenile shouldn\u2019t be sentenced to life in prison without parole in violation of the 8th Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nHe points to a 2012 ruling where the high court held the sentencing of juvenile homicide offenders to life in prison without parole ran afoul of the Constitution. And in 2016, the justices applied their 2012 ruling to a separate case involving a man who was sentenced to life without parole in Louisiana for a crime committed when he was 17.\n\nIn that ruling, the court said only \u201c\u2018the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption\u2019\u201d may be sentenced to mandatory life in prison without parole.\n\nSince Malvo was sentenced before those subsequent cases were decided, he\u2019s hoping the justices will apply the 2012 and 2016 cases retroactively, giving him a chance at a new punishment.\n\nThe government, though, says the court shouldn\u2019t apply the 2012 and 2016 holdings retroactively since it will upset the finality of state convictions decided years prior.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
