However, I will not be using their spin and will instead stick with the truth.\n\nBut thanks though. \u2014 US Rep Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) September 25, 2019\n\n\u201cI would like to thank @WhiteHouse for sending me their talking points on how best to spin the disastrous Trump/Zelensky call in Trump\u2019s favor,\u201d Rep.

Bill Pascrell Jr. (N.J.), shared the full talking points in a tweet, calling them \u201ccomplete Orwellian lies and toxic trash.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut maybe you\u2019d like to read them to appreciate their corruption! Hazmat suit possibly required,\u201d he said.\n\nThe trump White House just accidentally sent our office their talking points for deflecting trump\u2019s treachery. They\u2019re complete Orwellian lies and toxic trash, but maybe you\u2019d like to read them to appreciate their corruption!

Barr or Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Giuliani had separately pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate the conduct of former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nAmong the talking points distributed by the White House is the claim that there was no quid pro quo and that \u201cwhat the President actually talked about was entirely proper.\u201d\n\nThe White House argues that Trump \u201cdid not mention Rudy Giuliani or Vice President Biden until after President Zelenskyy had raised Giuliani first.\u201d But the email glosses over the fact that Trump did mention Biden of his own accord.\n\nThe White House also claims in the email that \u201cthe real scandal\u201d is about leaks in the run-up to the release of the rough transcript. And the email claims that the whistleblower complaint \u201cwas handled absolutely by the book and it was properly determined that no further action should be taken.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have maintained that a quid pro quo is not necessary for the president\u2019s conduct to be impeachable. They have also pressed for the White House to release the whistleblower complaint to the House and Senate intelligence committees, for the whistleblower to be allowed to testify and for Barr to recuse himself until the matter is resolved.", "description": "The email outlined the White House\u2019s messaging strategy following the release of the rough transcript of President Trump\u2019s call with his Ukrainian counterpart.
