Chief Executive Charles Scharf as its new CEO \u201cremoves a major overhang\u201d that has weighed on sentiment for months, and suggests that \u201cshareholder value will be an important prism through which decisions are made.\u201d\n\nIs that actually a good thing for Wells investors?\n\nMartinez said that while Wells Fargo\u2019s stock should \u201cinitially\u201d react positively, he kept his rating at neutral, writing in a note to clients that \u201csustained outperformance requires the ability to improve profitability materially, in our view.\u201d He said getting past the Federal Reserve\u2019s consent order is necessary for Wells to be able to cut costs.\n\nSee related: The sanctions against Wells Fargo are so unusual, no one knows what to think.\n\nAlso read: Wells Fargo\u2019s stock falls after another disappointing outlook, hawkish rate view.\n\nShares of Wells Fargo WFC, +3.77% rallied 4.2% in afternoon trading, enough to pace all the gainers in the S&P 500 index, while BNY Mellon shares BK, -4.50% shed 4.7% to lead the financial sector\u2019s losers.\n\nMeanwhile, although BNY Mellon didn\u2019t face the regulatory backlash from sales practice scandals that Wells did, or leadership uncertainty over the past six months, BNY\u2019s stock only outperformed Wells shares by 19 basis points--that\u2019s just 0.19 percentage points--while Scharf was in charge.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nFrom July 14, 2017, the day before Scharf was named CEO of BNY, through Thursday, BNY\u2019s stock fell 10.94%, while Wells\u2019 stock lost 11.13% over the same time.\n\nThat compares with a 1.26% decline in the SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded fund KBE, +0.21% , a 12.20% rally in the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF, +0.39% and a 21.08% surge in the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.53% over the same time.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nStill, Fitch Ratings said it views Scharf\u2019s appointment as CEO as a positive development as it fills a leadership void, and given his \u201ctrack record.\u201d Again, does Scharf\u2019s track record make him stand out?\n\nFrom the end of October 2012 through December 2016, which was when Scharf was Visa Inc.\u2019s V, -0.94% chief executive, Visa\u2019s stock soared 124.91%, while the S&P 500 rose 58.54%. But it barely outperformed rival Mastercard Inc.\u2019s stock MA, -1.74% , which climbed 124.02% over the same time.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nAnalyst Kenneth Leon at CFRA kept his hold rating on Wells Fargo, saying the question remains whether the bank will move in a new direction with its strategy.\n\n\u201cWe believe new leadership will be tested by the challenges that the bank still faces including the [Federal Reserve\u2019s] asset freeze from the consent order over a year ago and other bank regulators examining compliance issues,\u201d Leon wrote in an emailed note to clients. \u201cWe do not see new leadership as a disruptive change agent to where [Wells] is today, but will make incremental changes over the next 12 months.", "description": "Wells Fargo & Co. investors and analysts cheered the bank\u2019s announcement of a new chief executive, but there is also reason to believe investors should...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS241_Charle_ZG_20190927135834.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
