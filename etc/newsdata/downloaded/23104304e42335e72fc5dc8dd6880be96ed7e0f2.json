Which is apt given that until recently he could easily have been working in the real world rather than the one occupied by the elite cricketer.\n\nBrown is a rarity in the world of modern sport in more ways than one, having coming through a distinctly non-traditional route. Most cricketers have been picked up by their mid-teens and fast-tracked into county academies before making the step-up to first class cricket. Brown, though, was spotted by Worcestershire\u2019s coaches at a competition for young fast bowlers \u2013 their interest offering the England new boy a chance that he thought had passed him by.\n\nIf he makes his England debut against New Zealand at Christchurch\u2019s Hagley Oval in the early hours of Friday morning, it will represent a remarkably rapid change of fortunes for a bowler who has turned the slower ball and off-cutter into something approaching an art form. It will also postpone a career in the city for a few more years.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

But the studying did help my cricket, I think it took a bit of a focus off it and meant that I could just enjoy it that little bit more.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Team of tournament: Cricket World Cup 1/11 \u200bRohit Sharma (India) - 648 runs at an average of 81 The leading run-scorer and the first man to hit five centuries in a single World Cup, India were heavily reliant on their opener's contributions. At one stage he seemed destined to eclipse Sachin Tendulkar's benchmark for most runs in one edition (673), only to fall short after a rare failure in the semi-final against New Zealand. Getty 2/11 Jason Roy (England) - 443 runs at 63.28 A monstrous 153 against Bangladesh was followed by a hamstring tear, with England lacking vigour at the top of the order in his three-game absence. He amassed three half-centuries on his return and galvanised Jonny Bairstow. The pair have registered 11 century stands in 33 innings together at the top of the order, averaging 68.21. Action Images via Reuters 3/11 Kane Williamson (New Zealand) - 578 runs at 82.57 Named man of the tournament, Williamson's bashful response after apparently being told of the honour went viral and spoke volumes about the man. Not only did he break the record for most runs at a tournament for a captain, his grace and eloquence in the immediate aftermath of a heartbreaking final defeat earned him a legion of new admirers. AFP/Getty Images 4/11 Joe Root (England) - 556 runs at 61.77. Two wickets at 27.5 Despite finishing as England's leading run-scorer, it was a rather understated tournament for the Test captain, who was overshadowed by those around him. Nevertheless, England's glue regularly contributed in a way only he can, pushing the field and regularly rotating the strike, allowing his more flashy colleagues to take the plaudits. Getty 5/11 Shakib Al Hasan (Bangladesh) - 606 runs at 86.57. 11 wickets at 36.27 The only member of the XI who did not reach the knockout stages, but it was not for the lack of trying. The only player in the history of the tournament to amass more than 600 runs and take 11 wickets, statistically no one else comes close to matching these figures. Can count himself unlucky not to scoop the player of the tournament gong. Getty 6/11 Ben Stokes (England) - 465 runs at 66.42. Seven wickets at 35.14 Stokes' heroics in the final would have been enough to seal his entry here, but England's all-rounder has consistently delivered, primarily in a more nuanced role with the bat. A three-figure score may not have been forthcoming but there were five instrumental fifties, his 84 against New Zealand at Lord's the best of the lot. Getty 7/11 Alex Carey (Australia) - 375 runs at 62.5. 18 catches and two stumpings A stellar 71 against New Zealand, counter-attacking brilliantly after a top-order collapse, was the highlight for Carey, who also made half-centuries in losing causes against India and South Africa. It may be that the genial Carey is one place too low here and in Australia's line-up. He kept tidily enough, too. Getty Images 8/11 Mitchell Starc (Australia) - 27 wickets at 18.59 Setting a new record for most wickets at a single World Cup, relegating Glenn McGrath's haul of 26 scalps in 2007, tells its own story. The left-arm paceman is well on his way to greatness and his in-swinging yorker to castle Stokes at Lord's was probably ball of the tournament and one of its standout moments. Getty 9/11 Jofra Archer (England) - 20 wickets at 23.05 It is a little more than two months since the Barbados-born youngster made his international bow, but the wiry speedster became the first England bowler to take 20 wickets at a World Cup. Despite his rookie status, he was trusted with bowling during the Super Over shoot-out against New Zealand, ultimately holding his nerve at the death. Getty 10/11 Lockie Ferguson (New Zealand) - 21 wickets at 19.47 There were many tipping the paceman as one to watch in England and Wales, and Ferguson certainly did not disappoint. Only Starc took more wickets than a bowler whose blend of venomous short balls and toe-crushing yorkers, as well as a succinct slower ball, accounted for many a batsman. Action Images via Reuters 11/11 Jasprit Bumrah (India) - 18 wickets at 20.61 Given Bumrah typically bowls at the start and the end of the innings - when batsmen are looking to accelerate - his economy rate of 4.41 is extraordinary. India's pace spearhead was able to bamboozle many batsmen with his subtle changes of pace, while he very rarely seems to miss his length with his yorkers.

AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI wanted to see how far I could get. To be honest, for the first couple of years I just tried to enjoy my cricket as much as possible because I didn\u2019t know when it was going to stop. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was all just going to come to an end.\u201d\n\nLuckily for Brown, who has shone for Warwickshire at successive T20 Finals Days, things have worked out pretty well so far.\n\nIn many ways he\u2019s the prototype cricketer for the short format age. In fact, so cleverly does he vary his pace and angle of attack, that most observers would be hard-pushed to identify Brown\u2019s \u2018usual\u2019 operating pace.\n\nThe speed gun could sometimes be forgiven for giving up the ghost \u2013 as countless batsmen have done over the past two seasons.\n\nOnly Ravi Bopara could claim to have got the better of the Peterborough-born 21-year-old at Finals Day back in September, although his heroic efforts weren\u2019t quite enough to deliver back-to-back titles for the Pears.\n\nWith a T20 World Cup on the horizon, though, he knows that a decent tour of New Zealand in the absence of so many of England\u2019s big-name players, could thrust him into his country\u2019s long-term thoughts. That said, bowling at the death in T20 cricket could sometimes be enough to have him pining for the lecture theatre.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not so enjoyable sometimes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s my job in the team to bowl in the powerplay and then at the back end of the innings when the batsmen are flying.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m there trying to claw it back at the death in the 17th or 19th over or the 18th or 20th \u2013 I don\u2019t get the easiest overs when they\u2019re trying to knock it around at six or seven (an over). But that\u2019s part of the enjoyment for me \u2013 I love that competitive battle.\n\n\u201cI have got up to 88 miles per hour and although I\u2019m probably not up to 90 at the moment, I can consistently hit 86 to 88.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m honest, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had ample opportunities (in the County Championship) although I\u2019m not deluding myself that I\u2019ve done that well when I have been given the chance. When I did first play I was young and inexperienced. I probably wasn\u2019t good enough to bowl six balls in the same place.\u201d\n\nFor the moment, Brown can bide his time in four-day cricket, having established himself as one of the country\u2019s outstanding exponents of T20 concealment.\n\n\u201cI reckon it took about a year and a half before my knuckle-ball was really good,\u201d he says. \u201cThey take quite a long time. In 2018 my knuckle-ball was my probably my best ball but I\u2019ve been working on off-cutter for the past year. At Finals Day I was probably bowling 80 per cent cutters, 10 per cent knuckle-ball and 10 per cent quicker balls.\n\n\u201cIt has taken a long time to work on them and hopefully I\u2019m at a stage where I know enough about myself that when they\u2019re not coming out well then I\u2019m not panicking. That just happens. I know that I can put it right. I also know I\u2019ve got the sort of character that likes being in those different positions at the end of an innings.\u201d\n\nEngland will hope the man with the magic arm will find his feet as quickly in the international arena - and that his studious approach pays off.", "description": "Such is the baffling array of varieties purveyed by Pat Brown that if he hadn\u2019t made it as a cricketer he could well have got himself a job with Heinz.
