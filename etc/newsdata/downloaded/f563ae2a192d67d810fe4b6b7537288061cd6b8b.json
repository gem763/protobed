Not much, and what there is may be mere hype.\n\nChina has joined the \u201cMother of All Bombs\u201d club.\n\nA Chinese arms maker has unveiled a weapon similar to America\u2019s GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb, or MOAB (hence the nickname \u201cMother of All Bombs\u201d). The Chinese version was dropped from an H-6K bomber, the Chinese version of the 1950s Soviet Tu-16 aircraft.\n\nPhotographs on China\u2019s state-owned Global Times news site showed earlier in the year what appeared to be a large bomb falling from a bomb bay, and then a large explosion. Chinese military analyst Wei Dongxu told Global Times that based on photographic evidence and the size of the H-6K\u2019s bomb bay, the bomb was five to six meters long (16.4 to 19.7 feet long). Chinese media also suggested that the bomb weighed several tons, and was so big that the H-6K could only carry one.\n\n\u201cThe massive blast can easily and completely wipe out fortified ground targets such as reinforced buildings, bastions and defense shelters,\" or knock down trees so troops can rappel down from helicopters, Wei said.\n\nAccording to Global Times, military observers claimed that \u201cthe weapon will also spread fear among enemies if a weapon of this caliber is deployed.\u201d\n\nIf any weapon can inspire, it\u2019s giant bombs like these. The MOAB is the biggest non-nuclear bomb in the U.S. arsenal, and the biggest non-nuclear bomb that America has ever dropped. The MOAB is 30 feet long, weighs 21,600 pounds, and is so big that it isn\u2019t dropped by bombers, but rather is shoved out the back of a C-130 transport (the Air Force wants to equip the B-52 to carry them on its wings). Guided by GPS to its target, the MOAB works not by hitting the ground and exploding like a regular bomb, but explodes a few feet above the target in an airburst that destroys everything in the surrounding area with a massive overpressure. This means the force of the bomb isn\u2019t wasted burying itself in the ground, but spreads through the air.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "America already has one.", "authors": ["Michael Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fNwUsUUMihpTlMIyb284yw--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/f2d08dd2c7ad58749c0f72dae96d77cd", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
