His target was the synagogue in Halle\u2019s district of Paulusviertel, which is home to around 700 Jews. Armed with a customized shotgun and wearing a military uniform, the gunman set out on Wednesday to begin his slaughter, which he livestreamed from a GoPro mounted on his helmet.\n\nAs he drove to his target, he began his live broadcast by accusing Jews of being \u201cthe root of all problems\u201d and denying the existence of the Holocaust. German authorities would later say that the suspect was motivated by \u201cfar-right ideology.\u201d\n\nWith the synagogue in his sights, the gunman launched his attack, throwing an improvised explosive device (IED) over the fence of a nearby Jewish cemetery. The IED failed to detonate \u2013 but the assailant was undeterred. Now turning his full attention to the synagogue, he attempted to shoot his way into the building. Worshipers who had gathered for Yom Kippur had locked the temple\u2019s doors. The terrified congregation watched their would-be killer on a security camera as he attempted to break in.\n\nMiraculously, the doors endured, but the suspect was still out for blood. He opened fire on a woman standing near the entrance of the adjacent Jewish cemetery \u2013 claiming his first victim.\n\nReturning to his car, the assailant drove a short way up the road to a nearby kebab shop. Entering the cafe with his weapon drawn, he shot a man at point blank range. He left the shop after his weapon failed to fire again, but returned soon after to finish off the wounded man, who reportedly begged the killer to spare his life.\n\nAlso on rt.com First PHOTO of suspected Halle \u2018NAZI\u2019 killer who LIVESTREAMED shooting spree on Twitch\n\nEscape attempt\n\nPolice were at the scene soon after, forcing the suspect to flee in his car. After less than 30 minutes, he arrived at the neighboring town of Landsberg, where he tried to hijack a car from an auto repair shop. He then turned his gun on a man who tried to confront him, wounding the brave bystander.\n\nThe shooter eventually managed to commandeer a parked taxi and get on the highway, but his reckless driving resulted in a collision with a truck. Police quickly arrived at the scene, arresting the suspect and bringing his \u2018Nazi\u2019 killing spree to an end.\n\nThe city was put on high alert following the attack. Halle\u2019s central railway station was closed and police cordoned off parts of the city as they hunted for potential accomplices. For now, the killings appear to be the work of a lone gunman.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u20181ST FOOTAGE\u2019 of shooting in Halle, Germany shows suspect step out of car to fire weapon\n\nLike this story?
