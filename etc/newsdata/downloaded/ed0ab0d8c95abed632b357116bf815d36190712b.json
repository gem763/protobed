She was protesting a straitjacket-type design that was featured.\n\nOn Instagram, she posted a snapshot of her statement-making moment along with a powerful caption.\n\n\"I want to use this opportunity to remind people that this sort of bravery, is only a simple gesture compared to the bravery that people with mental health issues show every day,\" Tan-Jones said.\n\n\"The support people have shown to my act is more than I could imagine, so I only trust that we will share this same support to our friends, siblings, loved ones, acquaintances, internet friends or even strangers, who might be going through tough times with their Mental Health,\" she continued.\n\nShe received an outpouring of support. One person left a comment under her post saying, \"I'm so proud of you. \ud83d\udc4f thank YOU for not allowing a very sensitive topic to be desensitized.\"\n\nIn an earlier Instagram post, Tan-Jones further explained, \"As an artist and model who has experienced my own struggles with mental health, as well as family members and loved ones who have been affected by depression, anxiety, bipolar and schizophrenia, it is hurtful and insensitive for a major fashion house such as Gucci to use this imagery as a concept for a fleeting fashion moment.\"\n\nThe luxury retailer also posted a statement regarding this portion of the show explaining \"Uniforms, utilitarian clothes, normative dress, including straitjackets, were included in the #GucciSS20 fashion show as the most extreme version of a uniform dictated by society and those who control it.\"\n\nThe caption went on to say, \"These clothes were a statement for the fashion show and will not be sold.\"\n\nJacopo Raule/Getty Images for Gucci\n\nIt has also been mentioned that Creative Director Alessandro Michele intended for the blank-styled designs to represent how through fashion, power is exercised over life to eliminate self-expression. \"This power prescribes social norms, classifying and curbing identity,\" the brand wrote on Instagram.\n\nThis isn't the first time Gucci has received backlash for being insensitive.\n\nIn February, the brand released a sweater that some saw as including a design that resembled blackface. After issuing an apology statement, Gucci pulled the sweater from both its online and physical stores.", "description": "Ayesha Tan-Jones held up both of her hands with the message", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/gucci-gty-jt-190924_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
