Within weeks Joao Felix was the most hyped player as La Liga\u2019s 2019/20 campaign began, helped by startling goals against neighbours Real Madrid and countryman Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s Juventus during pre-season.\n\nBy his official debut against Getafe at the Wanda Metropolitano on opening day, he was already a marked man. Opposition defenders were out to test if the fresh faced kid was physically up to the challenge. The answer came with a thrilling sixty yard run from his own half, hurdling four different attempts to take him out, before he was finally felled inside the penalty area, to roars from smitten home fans.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cJoao Felix is an amazing player, very complete,\u201d ex-Benfica youth chief Joao Tralhao tells The Independent. \u201cHis talent is very easy to see. But what I like most is his mental qualities. If he is kicked or punched, he will not cry, he will fight. That amazing run with the ball, dribbling and resilience, everything we like to see in a young player. It showed what Joao is capable of doing.\u201d\n\nWeek two brought Joao a first La Liga assist, with a perfectly weighted through-ball for teammate Vitolo to score the winner at Leganes. Game three brought his first goal for Atletico, when he showed awareness and composure to finish after strike partner Diego Costa had rumbled behind the Eibar defence. Tralhao says he has not been surprised at that impact, recalling how eager the then 15 year old was to learn when he arrived at the Benfica academy.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Europa League a realistic target. AFP/Getty Images 9/33 25.

They'll have at least one 5-4 result, or something along those lines. AFP/Getty Images 13/33 21. Benfica Benfica remain extremely talented despite the departure of Joao Felix, but the hardened centre that is required for Champions League success isn't quite there. AFP/Getty Images 14/33 20. Lille An odd mishmash of forgotten faces (Jose Fonte, Loic Remy) and potential stars (Timothy Weah, Renato Sanches, Jonathan Bamba) but that might be to their detriment. Boom or bust.

Bayer Leverkusen They've lost Julian Brandt, but in Jonathan Tah, Leon Bailey and particularly Kai Havertz possess some of the best young talent in Germany. They'll be in the Round of 16 mix. Bongarts/Getty Images 19/33 15. Chelsea Untested manager, untested squad, and lost their only true attacking difference-maker in the summer. The Champions League could go very, very badly for Chelsea. AFP/Getty Images 20/33 14. Ajax Last year's semi-finalists, although they were made to sweat in qualifying this time around, and have lost star players Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt. AFP/Getty Images 21/33 13. Napoli Dark horses part one. Kostas Manolas and Kalidou Koulibaly might be the best centre-half pairing in the competition, and they have plenty of attacking resources from which to draw. AFP/Getty Images 22/33 12. RB Leipzig Dark horses part two. The installation of Julian Naglesmann as manager will further stimulate a squad that, if it clicks, can cause serious damage. AFP/Getty Images 23/33 11. Inter Milan Antonio Conte is a shrewd appointment who will drill his side well defensively, and Romelu Lukaku is a proven goalscorer, scoff as you might. Diego Godin could be talismanic. Getty Images 24/33 10. Tottenham Hotspur Calm yourselves, Spurs fans, but it is hard not to forecast a regression to something resembling the mean. Rode their luck a bit last time out all the way to the final, and already flirting with a soft implosion. They may yet turn it around, of course. Getty Images 25/33 9. Atletico Madrid Probably not Atletico's year given the summer talent drain, but Diego Simeone's ability to grind out wins cannot be fully discounted. Getty Images 26/33 8. Bayern Munich Interesting defensive additions, but probably another year or two away from re-assembling themselves for another proper tilt for the crown. Bongarts/Getty Images 27/33 7. Borussia Dortmund Dortmund above Bayern? Yep! Lucien Favre is putting something special together. The re-signing of Mats Hummels shores up an inexperienced defence. Bongarts/Getty Images 28/33 6. PSG Neymar leaving could be a blessing in disguise, should he indeed depart for Barcelona, with the forward line's roles better clarified and Kylian Mbappe fulfilling his destiny as a super-club's key player. AFP/Getty Images 29/33 5. Real Madrid It could all come tumbling down in Madrid this year, but do not rule out Zinedine Zidane cobbling together a meaningful Champions League run from a squad that has plenty of pure talent. AFP/Getty Images 30/33 4. Juventus The Ronaldo project worked, to some extent, in year one, and Juventus are making the right moves to improve the team around him and properly contend in the Champions League this year. Matthijs De Ligt's development will be fun to watch, though Maurizio Sarri's rigidity may hinder the Italians. AFP/Getty Images 31/33 3. Liverpool Right in the mix, again. Jurgen Klopp's side are possibly due a slightly less successful campaign, though, and an injury drastically alters the appearance of such a settled lineup in key areas. Getty Images 32/33 2. Barcelona Lionel Messi wants another Champions League. That should be reason enough to rank Barcelona this highly, even after their recent misfires. Antoine Griezmann has arrived, Neymar may be on his way, Frenkie De Jong is the best young player in Europe - this might just be the Catalans' year. Getty Images 33/33 1. Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways.

Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways. Getty Images\n\n\u201cWhen I saw him for the first time, he was not so developed physically, but he was an amazing talent,\u201d he says. \u201cHe is very, very clever, likes to learn, to try and understand what he needs to do in a game, to fulfil his coach's expectations. That is what you like to see in a youth player - his decision making. He understands the game like the best players, he sees things that others cannot.\u201d\n\nJoining Benfica\u2019s academy having previously spent seven years at rivals Porto, Joao Felix settled quickly, leading an U19s team coached by Tralhao past Real Madrid to the 2016/17 Uefa Youth League final. The following year he stepped up to Benfica's reserves, where he became the Portuguese second tier\u2019s youngest player ever, then its youngest goal scorer, then its youngest to get a hat-trick.\n\nThe progress through 2018/19 was just as rapid. He marked his second substitute appearance for Benfica\u2019s senior side with a late equaliser against city rivals Sporting Lisbon. A regular starter by Christmas, he scored 11 goals and eight assists in the last 19 games as his team clinched the Liga NOS title. There was also April\u2019s stunning Europa League treble against Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\n\u201cI was not surprised he was the Portuguese League's best player last year,\u201d says Tralhao. \u201cTo be honest I expected it. With the U19s, he was at another level to everyone else. Of course you need time to adapt to the different intensity and demands. But he was ready for the challenge.\u201d\n\nIt was clear Joao Felix was not long for the Estadio da Luz, where his release clause was raised to \u20ac50 million, then quickly again to \u20ac120m. Although Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Juventus, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid all sent scouts, often financially troubled Atletico secured his signature, with the support of Portuguese super agent Jorge Mendes.\n\nIt is particularly striking how quickly Joao Felix has settled at Atletico, where new signings are often shocked by the physical requirements of fitness coach Oscar Ortega, and the tactical strictures required by Simeone.\n\n\u201c[Simeone] is the right coach for him,\u201d says Tralhao. \u201cHe is very demanding, and Joao can learn a lot from him. I am not surprised at his immediate impact, because of his mental qualities and his talent.\u201d\n\nAtletico's senior players have shown an immediate respect for the youngster, with seasoned internationals like Koke and Costa looking to him to direct the team's attacks, so far either on the right of midfield or as a roving number 10.\n\n\u201cWhat I like the most in Joao, in terms of tactical approach, is that he can play everywhere,\u201d Tralhao says. \u201cHe can be a number 10. He can be a winger. He can be a nine, with more mobility like we have seen with other players. My favourite position for him is as a false nine.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018new Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019 tag is quickly attached to any promising young Portuguese talent, but did not seem to faze Joao Felix at his Atletico presentation in July. \u201cCristiano is Cristiano, I want to be myself. I am here to make my history, to be remembered as Joao Felix,\u201d he said quietly, but firmly. Taking over Antoine Griezmann\u2019s number seven shirt has also not appeared to worry him, while he has openly compared his style to other storied names including Rui Costa and Kaka.\n\n\u201cI know Joao very well and he does not feel pressure from outside,\u201d says Tralhao. \u201cThe pressure he feels is to train every day at his limits. He is a very, very positive guy. He comes from a very close family, they support him completely. We have many examples, some good, some not. But everyone around Joao is an example of how it should be.\u201d\n\nAlthough outshining Ronaldo when their clubs met pre-season in Stockholm, Joao Felix has remained in his national captain\u2019s shadow during their three games together for Portugal.\n\n\u201cCristiano Ronaldo is the best player from Portugal and one of the best players in history,\u201d Tralhao says. \u201cBernardo Silva is another of Portugal's best players now. Joao is on the right track to be up with them, and to be the next leader of the Portugal national team. He needs to keep developing his qualities, to train at his best level every day, but he has everything to do that. Over the next two years Joao will step up levels and become one of the best players in the world for sure. But his main challenge is a collective challenge - to compete for the La Liga title and the Champions League. That collective objective is the most important now, as Atletico can win the biggest trophies.\u201d\n\nNext up on that path is Wednesday's Champions League Group D opener at home to Juventus. Ronaldo hangs over this game too, as his hat-trick in Turin overturned Atletico's 2-0 first leg win when the teams met in last season's UCL last 16.\n\nSimeone's side took another blow last weekend, losing their 100% La Liga record with Joao Felix substituted early in a deserved 0-2 defeat at Real Sociedad.\n\nThe atmosphere at the stadium on Wednesday is sure to be optimistic however, with fans confident a new-look team is emerging with a young and attractive creative focal point, who has overcome every challenge faced so far.\n\nIf it was love at first sight in Burgo de Osma in July, a decisive performance in an Atletico win at the Wanda over Ronaldo and Juve would see Joao Felix really taken to rojiblanco hearts.", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m already in love with Joao Felix,\u201d was overheard in the stands about 15 minutes into the \u20ac126million youngster\u2019s first game for Atletico Madrid, during a friendly against second tier Numancia at the Trofeo Jesus Gil in mid-July.", "authors": ["Dermot Corrigan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/14/Joao-Felix.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
