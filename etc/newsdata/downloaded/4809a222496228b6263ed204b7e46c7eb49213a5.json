The Park Service and Federal Highway Administration are targeting a rough stretch of the parkways in preparation for winter. As part of the work to continue through the fall, crews are removing more than 76,000 square yards of the roads\u2019 surface, placing more than 7,000 tons of new asphalt, and leveling uneven parts of the road.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working this fall so the parkways are ready for winter driving,\u201d Superintendent Charles Cuvelier said. \u201cEven though this work won\u2019t address the entirety of either road, it\u2019s part of the National Park Service\u2019s long-term plan to maintain and eventually reconstruct both the George Washington Memorial and Clara Barton parkways.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Crews replaced a 50-foot-deep drainage structure in an area where a sinkhole formed and disrupted traffic earlier this year.", "authors": ["Luz Lazo", "Transportation Reporter Covering Washington'S Metro", "Buses", "Capital Bikeshare", "Taxis", "The Region'S Road Network"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5UJKp0AlY2NX7ys3bPUcrfkxlio=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NDNDEUDER5H6VCQPH5ZVQ2JF44.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
