Lululemon \u201chas done nearly everything right,\u201d but current valuations indicate \u201cthe market expects results to be flawless, leaving little room for disappointment,\u201d he warned.\n\nAn unusual increase in promotions for the brand and markdowns on outerwear led Citi to believe margins on merchandise may be weaker than expected, and with today\u2019s premium there is little room for Lululemon to disappoint. The expansion into new clothing categories like outwear and accessories may fuel \u201cmore inconsistency.\u201d He lowered his estimate for this year\u2019s earnings to US$4.70 from US$4.76 to reflect his more conservative margin assumptions.\n\nStill, Lejuez was optimistic that the clothing company would achieve another quarter of double-digit comparable sales. He left his price target unchanged at US$205.\n\nLululemon stock sank 2.6 per cent in pre-market trading to US$202.50.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "A Citi analyst cut the athletic clothing maker to a neutral rating from buy, and warned investors of a turbulent year ahead", "authors": ["Cristin Flanagan", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/lululemon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
