Now authorities are asking women who may be linked to the case to come forward.\n\nDr. Ulrich Klopfer\u2019s family made the startling discovery in his garage after his death at age 75 on Sept. 3, finding the 2,246 containers while looking through his personal effects, according to the Will County Sheriff\u2019s Office. On Sept. 12, the family\u2019s attorney called the coroner\u2019s office to report the finding and request that the containers be properly removed.\n\nCrime scene investigators, detectives and representatives of the coroner\u2019s office arrived at the home and collected the remains.\n\nAt a news conference Thursday, authorities delivered little new information about the case, acknowledging they are baffled as to what the doctor\u2019s motive may have been for breaking with standard medical practice to keep the remains.\n\nAccording to Sheriff Mike Kelley, the containers were dated from 2000 to 2002, which coincided with Klopfer\u2019s work at three abortion clinics in Indiana. Klopfer was an osteopath whose license to practice expired in October 2017, according to Indiana records. There was no evidence of any medical procedures having occurred on his property.\n\nTeresa Crawford/Associated Press A Will County sheriff's patrol is stationed outside the home of the late Dr. Ulrich Klopfer on Thursday in a village south of Chicago.\n\n\u201cI can tell you, the 31 years that I\u2019ve been doing this job, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this ever,\u201d Kelley told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those once-in-a-lifetime things.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely neighbors would have noticed anything was amiss because Klopfer\u2019s garage \u201cwas just like anybody else\u2019s garage,\u201d Kelley said.\n\n\u201cJust imagine your garage \u2015 you walk in and you\u2019re storing whatever \u2015 car parts, bottles of motor oil \u2015 that\u2019s what the garage looked like, basically, ceiling to floor.\u201d\n\nThe remains are set to be turned over to the Indiana attorney general\u2019s office to be preserved as evidence. Women who have had abortions and suspect they may be linked to the case have been encouraged to reach out to the Indiana attorney general\u2019s office.", "description": "Illinois authorities are baffled over why the former abortion provider hadn't followed standard medical practices.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8527a62100005a00e5814b.jpeg?cache=imjjbxopiw&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
