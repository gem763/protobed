The Miami-to-Nassau flight was grounded just before takeoff in July, authorities said.\n\nThe mechanic, Abdul-Majeed Marouf Ahmed Alani, was upset that contract negotiations between his union and the airline had stalled, and he wanted to delay the flight with the hopes that he would make overtime pay, federal prosecutors allege.\n\nAccording to federal investigators, Alani inserted and glued a piece of foam into the air data module system on American Airlines Flight 2834 on July 17, preventing it from functioning normally. The system, which sits beneath the cockpit, is responsible for monitoring an aircraft\u2019s speed, pitch and other flight data.\n\nCrew members in the cockpit received an error message just as the Boeing 737-800 was approaching the runway and decided to abort the takeoff, authorities said.\n\n\u201cAlani stated that his intention was not to cause harm to the aircraft or its passengers,\u201d said a criminal complaint affidavit filed in federal court in Miami. \u201cAlani explained to law enforcement that he was upset at the stalled contract dispute between the union workers and American Airlines, and that this dispute had affected him financially. Alani claimed that he tampered with the target aircraft in order to cause a delay or have the flight canceled in anticipation of obtaining overtime work.\u201d\n\nAlani was taken into custody Thursday and is expected to appear in federal court in Miami on Friday. It is not immediately clear whether he has an attorney. Alani, who joined American Airlines in 1988, has been suspended from work, according to a company spokesman.\n\nThe TWU-IAM Association, Alani\u2019s 12,000-member mechanics union, released a statement Thursday that did not explicitly mention Alani but condemned \u201cany conduct by any individual that jeopardizes the safe operation of an aircraft.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafety is the number one priority for our IAM and TWU members involved in the maintenance and operation of aircraft,\u201d the union wrote. \u201cThese members are the most highly trained safety professionals in the airline industry.\u201d\n\nThe union has been trying to secure a new contract with American Airlines for three years, the Associated Press reported. The company, which recently apologized to investors for various problems, has accused the union of purposefully slowing down work, causing hundreds of flights to be canceled over the summer.\n\nDaily News Quiz: Another House Republican exits ahead of 2020\n\nThis June, American had a 4 percent flight-cancellation rate \u2014 the highest among U.S. carriers, and nearly seven times the cancellation rate of Delta.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re behind,\u201d the airline\u2019s president, Robert Isom, said earlier this week. \u201cWe certainly haven\u2019t produced the kind of margins and earnings that we had hoped. We haven\u2019t run the best airline in our history.\u201d\n\nThe airline said it would resume negotiations with the mechanics\u2019 union on Sept. 16 with the help of a federal mediator, the AP wrote.\n\nFollowing the July incident, the Boeing 737-800 was taken out of service and sent for maintenance, which was when the foam was discovered, the Miami Herald reported.\n\n\u201cAmerican immediately notified federal law enforcement, who took over the investigation with our full cooperation,\u201d an American Airlines spokesman said in an email.\n\n\u201cAt American we have an unwavering commitment to the safety and security of our customers and team members, and we are taking this matter very seriously,\u201d wrote the spokesman, Ross Feinstein.\n\nPassengers on Flight 2834 were put on a different plane, which then took them to Nassau, the airline said. The air data module system on the original plane has since been fixed, and the aircraft has been returned to service, he said.", "description": "Abdul-Majeed Marouf Ahmed Alani inserted a piece of foam into the plane\u2019s air data module system, according to court documents.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter", "September At Am", "Rebecca Tan Is A Reporter Working On The Local Desk In D.C.
