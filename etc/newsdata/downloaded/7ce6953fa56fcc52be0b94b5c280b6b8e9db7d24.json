But when it comes to finding a place for mom and dad to live during their golden years, nursing homes might not make the most sense from a financial standpoint in the long run \u2014 plus, letting an aging parent live alone may cause anxiety and guilt for some families. And while some adult children are willing to welcome grandma or grandpa into their own homes with open arms, others might not have the space. What to do?\n\nAllow us to introduce you to the \"Granny Pod.\" Also known as the MEDCottage, the tiny home is essentially a portable hospital room designed by a Blacksburg, VA company, with help from Virginia Tech. Think of it as sort of a guest house with lots of high-tech medical extras. MEDCottages are pre-fabricated and designed to be installed in the backyard behind the main home (zoning laws permitting, of course).\n\nThe small dwelling is hooked up to the main home's existing sewer, water and power lines. Standard safety features include hand railings, defibrillators, first aid supplies, lighted floorboards and a soft floor to minimize damage from falls. The cost? All of this will run you between $85,000 to $125,000.\n\nA so-called Granny Pod can be compared to a bungalow from the outside, and a nice hotel suite on the inside with room for a bed, living room space, kitchenette and bathroom. The cottage is about 12 by 24 feet \u2014 essentially the size of a spacious master bedroom. Double French doors add an attractive touch, and also accommodate a wheelchair and hospital equipment, if needed. There are three styles: MedCottage, Classic and Grand.\n\nMEDCottages have gotten mixed reviews, with some noting that the dwellings could cause problems with neighbors or be seen as putting an aging parent \"in storage,\" but others find that it's a practical luxury to have mom close by in a cozy cottage.\n\nFind out more information at the developer's website.\n\n[h/t The Week\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "It's basically a nursing home for one.", "authors": ["Christine Coppa"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VbGSVUILtRFU9mxaW6WgOQ--~B/aD0zMjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_womens_health_52/c0537d3367bfb7e3f01f0840703b0fbb", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
