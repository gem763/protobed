And its opening five days have reminded everyone why this red carpet is considered among the world's most glamorous.\n\nWith guests arriving at the historic Palazzo del Cinema by boat, onlookers have been treated to a display of elegant couture and designer evening wear.\n\nFashion at the weekend's big premieres didn't disappoint. In particular, Penelope Cruz wowed onlookers in a Ralph & Russo couture gown and Atelier Swarovski jewels at the screening of her new movie \"Wasp Network\" Sunday evening. And Rooney Mara may have arrived with \"Joker\" star Joaquin Phoenix to the film's opening Saturday, but she stole the limelight in a structured white couture gown by Givenchy.\n\nElsewhere, Kristen Stewart turned heads at the premiere of her new movie \"Seberg\" on Friday in an elegant fuchsia lace creation by Chanel. She was joined by co-star Margaret Qualley in a pink pliss\u00e9 gown by Gucci, alongside other stars of stage, screen and runway.\n\nThere have been plenty of other eye-catching outfits on display since the festival opened Wednesday.\n\nAt the prestigious opening screening, an honor bestowed on French-Japanese production \"The Truth,\" the movie's co-stars Catherine Deneuve and Juliette Binochet were among red carpet's best-dressed (the former in a floor-length dress and sleeveless orange coat by Jean Paul Gaultier, and the latter in a beaded silver satin gown by Armani Priv\u00e9).\n\nJuliette Binoche and Catherine Deneuve walk the red carpet ahead of the Opening Ceremony and the \"La V\u00e9rit\u00e9\" (The Truth) screening during the 76th Venice Film Festival .

Elsewhere, Brazilian model Isabeli Fontana, South African model Candice Swanepoel and Chinese actress Ni Ni all impressed in differing shades of gold.\n\nThe world's most glamorous film festival?\n\nThursday evening's premieres for the much-anticipated \"Ad Astra\" and \"Marriage Story,\" also saw the stars of both movies turning up in style. Scarlett Johansson impressed in a custom sequined gown by Celine, while Laura Dern looked elegant in a dark green embroidered Gucci dress.\n\nThere will be more red carpets -- and many more fashion moments -- to come between now and Sept. 7, when the festival wraps up. But true to form, it has been a glamorous start to the world's oldest film festival.\n\nScroll through the gallery above to see the best looks from Venice Film Festival's red carpet.", "description": "The 76th Venice International Film Festival is reminding everyone why this red carpet is considered among the world's most glamorous.", "authors": ["Cnn Staff"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190901233514-40b-venice-film-festival-red-carpet-kristen-stewart-super-tease.jpg"}
