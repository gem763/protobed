Goldman Sachs is putting investors on notice that our current break from August\u2019s high volatility is just a short breather \u2013 October is likely to be just as unpredictable. In fact, the firm points out that since 1928, October\u2019s stock market volatility has averaged 25% higher. John Marshall, equity derivatives strategist for the firm, says, \u201cWe believe high October volatility is more than just a coincidence. We believe it is a critical period for many investors and companies that manage performance to calendar year-end.\u201d\n\nThe markets may be unpredictable, but you can still find stocks showing a solid record of strong returns. We\u2019ve searched TipRanks\u2019 database and found three stocks that are bringing in the long-term returns and dividends you need to insulate your portfolio in today\u2019s uncertain climate.\n\nStanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nBusiness mergers can sometimes bring the best together, Stanley Black & Decker (SWK \u2013 Get Report) is the modern incarnation of two storied names in power tools: Stanley, and Black & Decker. They merged in 2010 in a move that brought some of the most respected brands in the industry under one roof.\n\nThe power tool company has had a good run in recent years. SWK\u2019s 5-year gain is 77%, and the company is up 18% year-to-date. Shares have risen from $117 on the last day of 2018 to today\u2019s opening price of $140. And as an added attraction for income investors, SWK pays out a 1.96% dividend, in line with the S&P\u2019s average yield of 2.1%. The dividend pays out $2.76 per share annually.\n\nSWK\u2019s gains, and its hefty upside potential, have attracted plenty of love from top analysts recently. Last week, KeyBanc\u2019s Kenneth Zener upgraded his stand on this stock from neutral to buy, saying, \u201cWe see upside (tool share gains and wider portfolio outgrow market, favorable price/cost raise margins) \u2026 in line with market returns this year.\u201d His price target of $160 suggests an upside of 13% for the stock.\n\nMichael Wood, writing from Nomura, takes an even more optimistic stance on SWK. He kept his buy rating, and raised his price target by 10%, to $180. His new target indicates his confidence in a 27% growth potential.\n\nStanley Black & Decker keeps a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus. This is derived from 5 buys and 2 holds given the stock in the past three months. As noted, shares are selling for $140. The $168 average price target suggests a 19% upside potential in the coming year.\n\nIntuit, Inc.\n\nNo one likes the tax man, and we like having to report and file taxes even less. But we do have to file, every year, and a whole industry of accountants and DIY software has grown up around the requirement. Intuit (INTU \u2013 Get Report) is the maker of TurboTax, the popular home-use tax filing software, which has become the industry standard.\n\nThe success of TurboTax has pushed Intuit to ever-higher revenues. The company reported $1.99 billion in 2005, which rose to $3.40 billion in 2010, $4.19 billion in 2015, and $5.96 billion in 2018. Shares in INTU have gained also steadily gained; INTU is up an eye-catching 236% in the last five years, and has an impressive 36% year-to-date gain. For income investors, the share appreciation is the main attraction here, but the Intuit does pay out a reliable dividend. The yield is modest, at 0.79%, but the trading price high enough to put the payout at $2.12 per share annually.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Are you ready for a roller coaster ride in the markets?
