He visited around five or perhaps 10 times, she said. \"I didn't think it was awkward at all.\"\n\nShe quipped that she once offered Johnson the chance to have a go on her dancing pole but he refused.\n\n\"He sat down with his tea and started muttering,\" she said.\n\nJohnson has denied there was any impropriety in the relationship.\n\nThe government of London said last month it had referred Johnson to Britain\u2019s police watchdog for potential investigation over allegations of misconduct involving Arcuri.", "description": "U.S. entrepreneur Arcuri refuses to answer questions about intimacy with Boris Johnson", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9609Z_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
