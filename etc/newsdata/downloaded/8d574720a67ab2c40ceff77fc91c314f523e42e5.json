The party of free markets and fiscal discipline has been hijacked by a tariff-wielding president who continues to balloon the federal deficit. The party of Christian conservatism and family values has been taken over by a vulgar former reality TV star who often talks about evangelicals as if he\u2019s observing them in the wild.\n\nMake no mistake: The party has gotten what it most craves out of the Trump presidency, including tax cuts, Supreme Court judges and the reversal of many things President Barack Obama did over the preceding eight years. But beyond that, the details have been largely fungible \u2014 as if, whenever any doubt exists, Trump is to be trusted. When he does things that would once have been unthinkable in conservative circles, there\u2019s barely a peep of dissent. And when there is dissent, it\u2019s muted for fear of reprisals.\n\nAnd perhaps nowhere is that more the case, we\u2019re finding out, than on foreign policy.\n\nIn recent days, we\u2019ve learned that Trump scheduled a meeting with the Taliban close to the 18th anniversary of 9/11, only to cancel it. There was a report Wednesday night that he might give Iran a $15 billion loan to climb out of its sanctions-related morass (despite Trump having repeatedly attacked Obama for giving Iran money that it was owed). And this week, Trump fired the most preeminent neoconservative on his foreign policy team, John Bolton, who was reportedly fed up with the president\u2019s accommodation of such antagonistic foreign nations.\n\nThrow all of this on top of Trump\u2019s still-fruitless quest for a deal with North Korea and the major symbolic concessions he has made during that pursuit, and it\u2019s clear there\u2019s no real firm guiding principle at play beyond Trump.\n\nHis foray into possibly negotiating with the Taliban may be the most remarkable development to date. It\u2019s cliche to ask, \u201cWhat if Obama did it,\u201d but rarely has there been a better example of the double standard. And \u201cFox and Friends\u201d host Pete Hegseth came out and admitted that this week.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a fair statement to say that if Barack Obama had suggested such a meeting with the Taliban, we would all be going ferociously nuts about it,\u201d Hegseth said on Fox Nation. He added: \u201cBut at the same time, if you understand the lens \u2014 the way President Trump thinks \u2014 [he] eat, breaths and sleeps America, loves it, puts it first all the way, then you recognize that it\u2019s probably an outside-the-box idea that he had to try to get something across the finish line that he thinks would be good. And I think more credit could be given to the fact that he scrapped it.\u201d\n\nThis is a theme of criticisms of Trump\u2019s Taliban flirtations: Yeah, maybe it was an atrocious idea that we would have denounced before, but this is TRUMP. The criticisms are also generally buried beneath praise for his eventually scrapping his own allegedly horrible idea.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) has been out front in that regard. She\u2019s weighed in repeatedly on this, emphasizing the pullback while gently massaging the horrendousness of the initial idea into her praise.\n\nCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11.\n\n\n\nNo member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.\n\n\n\nThe Taliban still harbors al Qaeda.\n\nThe President is right to end the talks. \u2014 Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) September 8, 2019\n\nIn an interview with Fox News\u2019s Bret Baier on Monday, Baier repeatedly attempted to steer the conversation to what Cheney thought of the initial idea. Each time, she reverted to Trump eventually getting it right:\n\nBAIER: So why are we negotiating with them to begin with? CHENEY: We shouldn\u2019t be, and that\u2019s why I am very glad that the president said these talks are dead, we\u2019re not going to be negotiating with them. You can\u2019t trust the Taliban. You know we\u2019ve been talking about the Taliban for years, but the notion that somehow we think they\u2019re going to be a partner for peace, somehow they\u2019re going to give us counterterrorism assurances that we can count on \u2014 BAIER: But somebody thought it. CHENEY: It\u2019s wrong, we shouldn\u2019t be doing it, and I\u2019m very glad to see the President took the important, courageous step that he took to say, \u2018That\u2019s it, I\u2019m not going to let America be taken advantage of.\u2019\n\nYet even this soft criticism has earned Cheney headaches. Fox News\u2019s Steve Hilton denounced her and said her father, former vice president Richard B. Cheney, was \u201cliterally\u201d responsible for \u201cmillions of deaths.\u201d Two Republican state House members in Cheney\u2019s home state of Wyoming authored a Washington Examiner op-ed calling on her to \u201cstop carping at Trump for rejecting endless war.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who could be Cheney\u2019s Senate colleague in the relatively near future, lifted that op-ed up Wednesday and said: \u201cI agree! Why do some neocons continue to advocate for endless wars?\u201d Cheney shot back, \u201cI stand with @realDonaldTrump and our men and women in uniform who will never surrender to terrorists, unlike @RandPaul, who seems to have forgotten that today is 9/11,\u201d she said.\n\nI stand with @realDonaldTrump and our men and women in uniform who will never surrender to terrorists, unlike @RandPaul, who seems to have forgotten that today is 9/11. https://t.co/P0Ok2w48d5 \u2014 Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) September 12, 2019\n\nPaul\u2019s chief political strategist, Doug Stafford, followed that up by tweeting at Cheney, \u201cActually, @realDonaldTrump loves @RandPaul and I\u2019m pretty sure they both think your family is a bunch of chickenhawk warmongers who personally benefited from the military industrial complex and are responsible for thousands of lost lives and trillions of lost dollars.\u201d\n\nActually, @realDonaldTrump loves @RandPaul and I\u2019m pretty sure they both think your family is a bunch of chickenhawk warmongers who personally benefited from the military industrial complex and are responsible for thousands of lost lives and trillions of lost dollars. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f https://t.co/e0cwHzZ1i6 \u2014 Doug Stafford (@dougstafford) September 12, 2019\n\nIf there\u2019s a better metaphor for the GOP\u2019s current foreign policy transformation and crossroads, it\u2019s tough to do better than a Paul scion feuding with a Cheney scion. But as Bolton\u2019s excommunication and recent developments show, it\u2019s clearly the Paul-ite, noninterventionist approach that is ascendant in the Trump administration.\n\nThe hawks who remain around Trump, including most notably Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, are less likely to stand in his way on stuff like this. People such as Pompeo may be keeping Trump in check in certain ways, but things are clearly progressing in a very pronounced direction. That\u2019s why Bolton loyalists almost immediately began disowning whatever came from Trump\u2019s foreign policy from the moment he was fired forward.\n\nWe still see Republicans raising objections, most notably from the likes of Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and also this week from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who warned against scrapping the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d approach to Iran. But it\u2019s always soft. It\u2019s always sprinkled with timidity because they recognize who\u2019s in charge. Cheney is a great example of someone who is perhaps now learning the pitfalls of even soft Trump criticism. Her home-state Republicans are attacking her and Paul is now labeling her a \u201cNeverTrump\" Republican -- including on CNN Thursday afternoon -- at a time when she\u2019s considering running for Senate in the most pro-Trump state in the 2016 election (67-22 for Trump).\n\nBut the more everyone slow-walks it and declines to actually say out loud that Trump is getting it wrong, the more this shift will take hold.\n\nHi @Liz_Cheney, President @realDonaldTrump hears all your NeverTrump warmongering. We all see your pro-Bolton blather. I\u2019m just grateful for a president who, unlike you, supports stopping these endless wars. \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) September 12, 2019\n\nUpdate: And now Cheney hits back again, saying Paul\u2019s \u201cmotto seems to be \u2018Terrorists First, America Second.\u2019\"", "description": "The president's foreign policy appears to have taken a turn, thanks to critics who have been afraid to criticize things they once would have abhorred.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ouIKi5URWbRTKnF2T5OaWphFoRo=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-09-2019/t_e0ac7b657dd94a6aa71e40193208a9f0_name_43b07988_d341_11e9_8924_1db7dac797fb_scaled.jpg"}
