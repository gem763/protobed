In a new manifesto, the NUS demands higher education is 'decolonised' and says some parts 'have propagated systems that assure white privilege'\n\nThe union said while it feels universities have recognised there is a 'need to dismantle these systems,' 'thanks to NUS campaigning,' it wants more to be done to create in its words a truly liberated education, 'one that can thrive free from isolated attachment to western narratives.'\n\nThe manifesto also states says that the NUS will work to 'break down the barriers to succeeding in education and society'.\n\nIn a section entitled 'decolonising our education', it says: 'Our educational structures and institutions are a product of colonialism: some have directly profited from this, while others have propagated systems that assure white privilege.\n\n'This is reflected in the racist barriers and structures students face, with the attainment gap the most striking symptom of race inequity.'\n\nThe NUS has pledged to support activists working across the county, 'to understand, identify, and actively challenge the racist structures in our colleges and universities.\n\n'We will ensure that these groups can collaborate and speak together about the future of our education,' the union said.\n\nThe NUS's 10-point plan focuses on three areas overall, as well as 'breaking down the barriers to succeeding in education and society', these are 'building a movement to transform education' and 'breaking down the barriers to accessing education and taking part in society'.\n\nCalling the education system broken, Zamzam Ibrahim, NUS national president (pictured above) said, 'While our plan contains ambitions beyond our year, it is founded in the reforms that members have told us they want, and the needs of today's and tomorrow's students'\n\nThe 18-page plan also covers issues such as funding; accessible and affordable housing and transport; health care and fair access to education.\n\nThe union highlighted action taken by SOAS, University of London, the higher education institution is described as the world's leading institution for the study of Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\n'A joint report published by the NUS and vice-chancellors' group Universities UK (UUK) in May this year, looked at attainment of Black, Asian and minority ethnic students, noted that SOAS, University of London, has established an action plan outlining the institution's 'commitments to address the need for decolonisation within the school,' the union stated.\n\nCalling the UK education system broken, Zamzam Ibrahim, NUS national president said: 'While our external environment is somewhat turbulent, and continues to be uncertain, we've still been able to launch a priority campaign focused on delivering a sustainable, accessible, life-long, funded solution to our broken education system and our biggest ever annual voter registration campaign for young people, that's already showing results.\n\n'While our plan contains ambitions beyond our year, it is founded in the reforms that members have told us they want, and the needs of today's and tomorrow's students.\n\n'We'll be looking to work with our members and students more closely in coming months as we launch other initiatives that support the delivery of our 10-point plan.'\n\nOther 'decolonising the curriculum' campaigns have included the 'Rhodes Must Fall campaign', which called for institutions in Oxford and South Africa to remove statues of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes.", "description": "The NUS said more needs to be done to create a 'truly liberated education.'
