I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll go home tonight and be happy with that one.\u201d\n\nWhile he partnered 21-year-old regular Rashford up front, teenagers Angel Gomes and Tahith Chong made their full debuts before being replaced by Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard respectively.\n\nLingard hit the post in the 80th minute and Diogo Dalot missed a sitter in front of 50,000 fans as United raised the tempo after going ahead but still looked short of creativity.\n\n\u201cIt was a hard game. First half we tried to open the game and to score a fast goal but they had a solid defence,\u201d Matic told BT Sport.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for the (young players) to have the opportunity to play these games. They have to use that, to work hard to get more chances.\u201d", "description": "Seventeen-year-old striker Mason Greenwood scored his first senior Manchester United goal and saved his side's blushes in a 1-0 win over Kazakhstan's Astana in their Europa League Group L opener at Old Trafford on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431750383&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I20C", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
