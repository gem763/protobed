Add The Note as an interest to stay up to date on the latest The Note news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nPresident Donald Trump says he isn't worried about impeachment. The movement on the House side is real, though there's nothing in the initial response to the latest conflagration that suggests he should sweat the Senate math.\n\nBut don't mistake a lack of public GOP panic for anything approaching comfort. Democrats are starting to pick up on the Republican consternation over Trump's actions regarding Ukraine, in ways that could push the impeachment conversation forward, even amid its uncertain politics.\n\nHouse Democrats will hold a members-only meeting Tuesday afternoon to discuss next steps. Those steps appear closer than ever to including impeachment, with a deluge of newly elected members joining the ranks of those saying that looks like the right path.\n\njoewalsh.org via Reuters\n\nRepublican critics of Trump will get a new kind of visibility on Tuesday night. Two challengers for the GOP presidential nomination -- former Rep. Joe Walsh, and former Gov. Bill Weld -- will debate each other in a forum hosted by Business Insider that comes even as more states cancel primaries and caucuses to demonstrate loyalty to the president.\n\nJose Luis Magana/AP, FILE\n\nWeld is already calling the president's actions \"treason.\" Sen. Mitt Romney labeled his behavior potentially \"troubling in the extreme,\" while former Gov. John Kasich is asking, regarding the push for necessary answers about his conduct, \"Where are the Republicans?\"\n\nPredictable responses from the expected voices? Perhaps. But the Republicans Kasich is asking about may yet be found.\n\nWith deadlines set on Capitol Hill, the questions about transparency and accountability being posed to the White House this week could force Republicans to confront differences between what they might condone and what they're prepared to defend.\n\nFor now, there's something approaching bipartisan agreement that more must be learned about what the president actually said and did.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the Democratic chairmen of the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees sent another letter Monday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, doubling-down on their request for documents, specifically regarding any efforts from the president or his associates seeking the help in the 2020 presidential election from foreign governments.\n\n\"Seeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, Democracy, and the Constitution, which the President is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend,\" the chairmen wrote, while suggesting subpoenas would be necessary should Pompeo not \"fully comply\" with requests.\n\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP, FILE\n\nMeanwhile in the Senate, Republican Leader Mitch McConnell pointed fingers back at Democrats and accused them of politicizing ongoing work from the intelligence committees.\n\nMcConnell said he was \"very glad\" to see the White House release congressionally-approved aid to Ukraine, because Russia poses a significant threat to U.S. interests, which -- he argued -- can best be countered by the U.S. working closely with \"allies and partners.\"\n\nThe Senate leader left out of his remarks any mention of the fact that the Trump administration slow-walked that $250 million in security assistance funding to Ukraine for months.\n\nThe TIP with Kendall Karson\n\nThe Democratic National Committee raised the stakes for the presidential contenders to qualify for the first winter debate in November: upping the grassroots donor mark to 165,000 and the polling requirement to either 3% support in four national or early-state polls or 5% support in two early state polls.\n\nBetween the second debate in July and the third in September, hosted by ABC News and Univision, a 1% increase in the polling threshold cut the qualifying field in half. This time around, another modest 1% bump could cripple those who are only just clearing the bar.\n\nWin Mcnamee/Getty Images\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who consistently lands at 2% in polling, but peaked at 4% in one ABC News/Washington Post poll from early July, could potentially miss the cut. Or billionaire activist Tom Steyer, who qualified for October after the third debate has only received 3% in one Iowa poll.\n\nSome of the candidates are showing progress. Castro, Steyer and at least nine others have crossed the grassroots threshold for November, according to an ABC News analysis. Benefiting the most from the more rigorous rules are the front runners in the horse race -- who are finding themselves in more stable territory as the debate criteria will likely winnow the field.\n\nONE MORE THING\n\nConfused about the genesis of this latest controversy surrounding President Donald Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian leader?
