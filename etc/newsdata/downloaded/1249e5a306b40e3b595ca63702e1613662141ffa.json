Protesters burned and looted election offices Monday night after the socialist president emerged from an unexplained gap in the publication of election results in better shape than he entered it.\n\nAD\n\nThe government elections tribunal Thursday showed Morales approaching the 10 percentage-point lead needed to avoid a runoff election in December. With more than 98 percent of the votes from Sunday\u2019s election counted, Morales was at 46.4 percent; his main rival, former president Carlos Mesa, was at 37.1 percent.\n\nAD\n\nBut that was after an unexplained gap in results for nearly 24 hours Sunday and Monday. Preliminary returns after the polls closed Sunday evening suggested the race was headed for a runoff, which analysts said Morales had a strong chance of losing. The next numbers, published Monday evening, showed the tally had swung in his favor.\n\nProtesters in La Paz and other cities set fires, looted offices and tore down a statue of the late Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, a Morales ally.\n\nAD\n\nMorales, generally popular in Bolivia after 13 years but less so than in the past, celebrated victory Thursday. \u201cGood news,\u201d he said at a morning news conference. \u201cWe already won the first round.\u201d\n\nHe had warned the night before of a coup attempt led by \u201cthe right,\u201d in coordination with foreign powers: \u201cWe have confronted it without violence, but I have to say, we are in a state of emergency to defend democracy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMesa, who has united opposition parties from the right and the left against Morales, called the accusation \u201cincredible\u201d and accused Morales of \u201cmaneuvering a massive fraud.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is someone that systematically violates and breaks the constitutional rule of law, it\u2019s Evo Morales,\u201d said Mesa, who was president from 2003 to 2005. \u201cHe controls and gives orders to all the powers of the state.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMesa warned supporters that he risked jail for \u201cfalse accusations\u201d of instigating violence. He called for nationwide \u201cpermanent mobilizations.\u201d\n\nThe Coordinator for the Defense of Democracy, a committee formed Wednesday by Mesa, other opposition leaders and civil society groups, called for \u201cpeaceful protests\u201d until the government agrees to go to a second round of voting.\n\nThe chief elections observer for the Organization of American States said Wednesday that Bolivian authorities had no valid explanation for the gap in publishing vote counts. The OAS, which met in Washington on Wednesday to discuss the election, has called the gap \u201csurprising\u201d and \u201cworrying.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGerardo de Icaza, the OAS director of electoral observation and cooperation, said the election should go to a second round, no matter the results of the first.\n\n\u201cGiven the context and the evidenced problems in this electoral process, it would still be a better option to go to a second round,\u201d he said. On Thursday, the European Union agreed.\n\nCarlos Trujillo, the U.S. representative to the OAS, said the United States \u201csoundly rejects the Electoral Tribunal\u2019s ongoing attempts to subvert Bolivian democracy by delaying the vote count and taking actions that undermine the credibility of Bolivia\u2019s elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that President Morales and his party know their own unpopularity, they will cheat to win,\u201d Trujillo said. \u201cIf he is as popular as he claims, he will win in the second round.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMorales drew support from fellow Latin American leftists.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Bolivian people will overcome the violence of this attempt by sectors of the right, which want to destroy Bolivian democracy, destroy President Evo Morales and violate the reality of the constitution and laws,\u201d Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro said in a televised address Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe left continues in the Latin American political map,\u201d Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel tweeted. \u201cDespite the media war of the continental right, Evo won for the fourth time. Congratulations brother.\u201d\n\nMorales, Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president, is credited with bringing significant economic growth and reducing poverty and inequality in one of the region\u2019s poorest countries. He also has been accused of weakening democracy and concentrating power.\n\nAD\n\nThe fact that he was running for a fourth term was controversial: After losing a referendum in 2016 that would have allowed him to sidestep term limits, he secured a court ruling that enabled him to run again anyway.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainty \u2018Evo fatigue\u2019 in the country, and protests are a real threat to Morales,\u201d said Ra\u00fal L. Madrid, a University of Texas political scientist who studies indigenous and leftist politics in Latin America. \u201cBolivia is not Venezuela, which is clearly authoritarian. It has been teetering on the edge for a while, and I think it would be very costly for Morales to lose respect from the international community by stealing these elections.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The president, leading in the official vote count, warned of a \u201ccoup attempt\u201d by \u201cthe right.\u201d His main opponent accused him of \u201cmassive fraud.\u201d", "authors": ["Rachelle Krygier"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ti8rX3NvvgLOKqh7JO7afaOTX7s=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MZDLJFHWPUI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
