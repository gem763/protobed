REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nMANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Finance minister Sajid Javid said on Tuesday there would be a budget this year, the content of which would depend on whether Britain leaves the European Union with a deal or without a deal.\n\nBritain is less than a month away from leaving the EU - a pivotal moment for the world\u2019s fifth largest economy - but there is huge uncertainty about what terms it will exit on and whether it will leave the bloc on time, or even at all.\n\nJavid on Monday set out his economic agenda to the Conservative Party\u2019s annual conference, promising that if there was no exit deal, he would deploy \u201cthe full armoury of economic policy\u201d if needed.\n\nOn Tuesday, speaking at an Institute of Economic Affairs event on the sidelines of the conference, he was asked if there would be a formal budget statement this year.\n\nRelated Coverage Cost of no deal Brexit pales in comparison to political damage of not leaving - UK finance minister\n\n\u201cYes, it will be this year,\u201d he replied, without specifying whether it would be before or after Oct. 31, when Britain is due to leave the EU.\n\nJavid declined to set out any firm plans on taxation or spending, but said he wanted to simplify the tax system and suggested there could also be supply side reforms.\n\n\u201cOf course if it was a \u2018no deal\u2019 outcome, which is still a possibility, there would be other action that you\u2019d want to take which would support the economy, and things that we\u2019d only want to consider in a \u2018no deal\u2019 situation,\u201d he said.", "description": "Finance minister Sajid Javid said on Tuesday there would be a budget this year, the content of which would depend on whether Britain leaves the European Union with a deal or without a deal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435975449&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9037E", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
