We have not done enough to educate people on protecting against risk. Our industry will have a lot to answer for when the next global financial crisis (GFC) strikes and some retirees find their capital has been decimated.\u201d\n\nThose who retired just before the 2008-09 GFC could still have scars from sequencing risk. The S &P/ASX 200 more than halved from its peak within two years, crushing share portfolios. Anecdotally, some early-stage retirees moved to cash after the GFC, crystallising share losses and missing the equities recovery this decade.\n\nTime to take action\n\nWith US equities enjoying the longest bull market in history, those nearing retirement or just in it should pay extra attention to sequencing risk. Nobody knows when or if global sharemarkets will fall or the potential magnitude of losses, but no bull market lasts forever.\n\nMore than $22 trillion is invested in negative-yielding sovereign debt as investors pay governments in Europe and Japan to hold their money, such is the economic uncertainty. The bond market is signalling economic distress but equities keep rising. It could end badly.\n\nMoreover, record-low interest rates are encouraging retirees to turn to the sharemarket for franked dividend yield, investing more of their retirement savings in equities than they otherwise might and exposing their portfolio to potential market shocks.\n\nMatterson says those nearing or just in retirement should quantify how much of their portfolio would be exposed to a sharemarket downturn and how that would affect their lifestyle. \u201cIf you cannot tolerate a 20 to 30 per cent fall in the equities component of your portfolio, you need to take steps to insulate that asset from the risk of a market shock.\u201d\n\nPortfolio insurance sounds good in theory. However, hedging portfolios can be costly and complex. Unlike insuring a house for decades, investors may not need portfolio insurance at different stages of their investment lifecycle, or for different assets.\n\nCapital-protected investment products have waxed and waned in popularity over the years. They tend to appeal when markets are volatile and investors nervous. Too often, their higher fees chew into returns and investors have to sacrifice too much upside gain for protection.\n\nUsing index put options, futures contracts, contracts-for-difference (CFDs) or inverse exchange traded funds (that rise when a sharemarket index falls) to insure portfolios is too complex for most retirees. These strategies can destroy capital quickly if markets move in the wrong direction and investors are caught on the back foot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiversification key\n\nThe best portfolio protection is asset allocation and diversification: holding fewer growth assets such as equities when markets are expensive and more defensive assets such as cash, fixed interest and gold. Or infrastructure or other alternative assets that are less affected by sharemarket falls.\n\nBut as interest rates fall, retirees cannot afford to have too much of their portfolio in cash. The yield is too low and younger retirees need a higher allocation to growth assets that deliver better returns over time to ensure their money lasts as long as they do.\n\nUsing an active managed fund that moves between asset classes as market conditions dictate is another option. However, the mandate of some equity funds requires them to be invested fully in shares and almost nine out of 10 actively managed Australian equity funds did not beat the S &P/ASX 200 index in 2018, according to S &P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nThis recurring underperformance has sparked massive fund inflows into passive ETFs that replicate an underlying index at lower cost. ETFs are a useful tool, but early-stage retirees who use them risk being locked into an index return in a bear market. The best active fund managers earn their fees at big market turning points, by minimising losses.\n\nLook at falls in bad times\n\nAaron Binsted, portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management, says investors should focus on an active managed fund\u2019s risk performance, not just its returns. \u201cThe investment industry is built on maximising total returns. But many retirees want a reasonable return over time with less risk and volatility. They do not want their portfolio to fall sharply when markets fall.\u201d\n\nThis thinking guides the Lazard Defensive Australian Equity Fund. Launched in 2012, the value-focused fund aims to deliver a higher gross yield than the S &P/ASX 200 Accumulation Index and avoid large drawdowns in performance compared with the index during market corrections.\n\nThe fund\u2019s performance is slightly below the S &P/ASX 200 since inception but with less volatility. The fund\u2019s loss in negative months for the Australian sharemarket is about half that of the broader market.\n\nBinsted says retirees and their advisers need to assess how much risk a fund took to achieve its returns. \u201cThe starting point is asking how the fund performed during a negative period: does it consistently fall more or less than the sharemarket in bad periods? And does the fund tend to recover those losses faster than the market when conditions improve?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExperienced investors might assess how the fund\u2019s beta \u2013 an historical measure of volatility \u2013 changes over time. Those concerned about sequencing risk should seek funds that have falling beta in rising markets. \u201cYou want funds that can maintain their capital and income returns, despite holding more cash as sharemarkets become more expensive,\u201d says Binsted.\n\nBeta, standard deviation, drawdowns and risk-adjusted returns are, of course, a foreign language for many retirees. They just want to know their hard-earned savings can deliver solid capital and income returns from shares over the long term without the rollercoaster ride.\n\nCapital protection\n\nMatthew Rady, CEO of Allianz Retire+, says the need for capital-protected equity products drove the launch of Future Safe, a new product that allows retirees to determine how much loss they are prepared to accept from an investment in Australian and global shares, or a fixed rate.\n\n\u201cWhen we spoke to retirees their number one concern was not just about running out of money,\u201d Rady says. \u201cIt was also about going backwards after a financial shock and not being able to maintain their lifestyle. They fear they will have a very different life in retirement to the one they are used to.\u201d\n\nRady says capital-protected products have historically been too dear. \u201cPaying sharply higher fees for portfolio protection year after year dents overall returns. When you are accumulating assets in your younger years, or when you hold mostly cash and fixed interest later in life, you do not need portfolio insurance. It is the period just before and after retirement when protecting shares and other growth assets make sense.\u201d\n\nAn investor in Future Safe can, for example, choose a -10 per cent floor in the value of their investment. If Australian shares fall, say, 20 per cent in a year, their loss is limited 10 per cent. The catch is, the maximum potential return they can receive in a year is 11.4 per cent, using September 2019 Future Safe rates. Also, investors have to lock their money away for seven years or pay break fees if they need it earlier.\n\nAn older investor who can only tolerate a small loss could choose a -5 per cent floor in Australian shares through Future Safe. Their maximum return in a year is 7.5 per cent at current Future Safe rates. \u201cA lot of retirees are content with a high single-digit return from the sharemarket if the most they can lose is a small amount,\u201d says Rady. \u201cThey are willing to sacrifice upside gains, to a point, if it means their money is safer.\u201d\n\nFuture Safe\u2019s annual fee is 85 basis points \u2013 less than most active managed funds and some ETFs, and below what products with inbuilt capital protection normally charge.\n\n\u201cWe believe capital protection is the future of equity investment products for retirees and the best way to avoid sequencing risk,\u201d says Rady. \u201cThe challenge is offering capital protection at low cost, making it simple and tailoring it to those who need it most just before and after retirement.\u201d\n\nETFs\n\nInvestors who want to minimise losses without sacrificing as much potential upside returns could use several new ETFs that reduce volatility or have inbuilt risk overlays to limit losses.\n\nMinimum-volatility ETFs issued by iShares or Vanguard, for example, hold a portfolio of stocks that historically are less volatile than the broader sharemarket. BetaShares Managed Risk Australian Shares Fund sells equity futures contracts to smooth investment returns.\n\nThese and similar ETFs are designed to reduce losses in a falling market. But as the last GFC showed, most stocks fall during financial crises, magnifying sequencing risks for retirees who cannot wait years for a recovery and exposing those who believe \u201cinvesting for the long term\u201d cures all portfolio mistakes.", "description": "Being heavily invested in shares in a market crisis can savage retirement lifestyles so those near retirement must take action to mitigate sequencing risk.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7062%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/94c8e5faefbe750d765ac9911ef280264cf0bd39", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
