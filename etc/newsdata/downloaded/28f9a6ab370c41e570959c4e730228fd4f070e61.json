I'd done a few bits and pieces but Emmerdale is my first big TV role.\n\n\"My mum and late grandmother always watched Emmerdale so it was pretty daunting coming in. And not only was I new to the show, I had not really done any intimate scenes before.\"\n\nHe added: \"I won't lie, a lot of the time I've been overwhelmed by them.\n\n\"You don't even feel that sexy doing them. You have so many people around you, and the boom operators who can hear every little sound you make when you're kissing. So it's not the sexiest when you're doing it.\"\n\nJurell was full of praise for his co-star Natalie J Robb, who plays femme fatal Moira.\n\nDescribing her as his mentor on set, Jurell added: \"She's someone who has become a great friend as well which has been really nice.\"\n\nBut the actor says fans have had a mixed reaction to his character's passionate relationship with Moira, who is one half of the soap's most popular couples.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"When I first started I found it quite hurtful at times especially when the lines were blurred and it became a bit personal.\n\n\"Now I've made the decision not to even look as I find it's just best to get on with my job. But it's not all been negative, I've had some really lovely messages, and people sending me their drawings of Nate.\"\n\nJurell also revealed he'd originally auditioned for the role of bad boy Billy Fletcher but lost out to Jay Kontzle.\n\nHowever, bosses were still impressed and asked him to try out for new character Nate.\n\nHe's now getting used to being recognised in the supermarket and teased about his exploits with Maura.\n\nTonight Jurell faces his biggest night in the soap yet as he takes centre stage in an explosive hour long special.\n\nNate and Moira are lured out onto a boat by Cain, played by Jeff Hordley, after he uncovers their affair.\n\nProducers have promised viewers a huge twist but Jurell is remaining tight-lipped on the dramatic climax.\n\n\"There's so many theories out there but when the audience see it they will be shocked\" he said.\n\nFind out what happens when Emmerdale's hour-long special airs tonight on ITV at 7pm.", "description": "Tonight Nate Robinson is lured to a lake by Cain Dingle after he uncovers the farmhand's affair with his wife Moira", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18938524.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/27_07_emm_nate_moira_1st_ep_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
