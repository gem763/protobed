Vendors not only sell tulip bulbs but also narcissus, snowdrops, carnations, violets, peonies and orchids.\n\nInvestigators found a similar problem along the so-called \"flower bulb boulevard\" in Lisse, a bulb-field town south of Amsterdam where the famous Keukenhof gardens are also situated.\n\nOf the bulbs bought from the rows of stalls along a main road in Lisse, only two percent ever bloomed, the KAVB said.\n\nWATCH: These 10 lesser known fun facts will make you say 'Amsterdamn!'\n\nSince first imported from the Ottoman Empire 400 years ago, tulips \"have become our national symbol and the bulb industry a main player in the Dutch economy,\" said Le Clercq.\n\n\n\nBut the \"deception about the tulip bulbs is a problem that has been existing for the past 20 years,\" he added.\n\nThe victims are often tourists, KAVB director Andre Hoogendijk said.\n\n\"A tourist who buys a bad bulb is not likely to come back,\" he told Amsterdam's local AT5 news channel.\n\nVendors at the market told AT5 that complaints were known.\n\n\"There are indeed stalls here that sell rubbish. That is to everyone's disadvantage, because it portrays the whole flower market in a bad light,\" one unidentified vendor said.\n\nAmsterdam and the KAVB have now referred the matter to the Dutch consumer watchdog.\n\nQUICK GUIDE TO THE NETHERLANDS: Going Dutch for your next Euro trip\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
