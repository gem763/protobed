A group have also placed 800 potted trees outside Parliament as they called on Boris Johnson to plant billions more across the UK.\n\nAnd a new plot to shut down London City Airport for up to three days from 9am on Thursday by occupying the terminal emerged today.\n\nOver 100 members of the group are planning to attend City Airport, claiming that the plan is to do a 'Hong Kong' style occupation of the terminal building, which will involve demonstrators sitting and lying in front of the departure and arrival gates.\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists continue protesting outside Whitehall on Tuesday evening. 531 people have been arrested so far in the first two days of the protests\n\nA protester is detained during an Extinction Rebellion demonstration at Whitehall on Tuesday evening, the second day of two weeks of protests\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters in the Wesminster area on Tuesday night.

Pictured: a protestor gets carried away by police\n\nAs well as this organisers have been communicating with protesters throughout the day, advising them of the sites which remain occupied and encouraging them to 'keep going'. Messages exchanged between organisers and protesters also reveal that so-called 'Plan C' sites are to be more disruptive than others.\n\nAdmitting defeat Inspector Simon Rooke, who is based in the square, said: 'At this time we are saying 'If you want to protest by all means protest but you need to do it here'.'\n\nAnd when asked why police had failed to stop them setting up camp despite weeks preparing he said: 'They are very well organised and very well-funded. That's all I can say', according to The Times.\n\nPolice have been criticised by many for their so-called 'softly-softly approach' and this afternoon one woman was pictured being dragged away from the protest.\n\nHoards of people were seen in central London today as many gathered to protest across 12 sites in the city. The group have also announced plans to continue strikes at London City Airport\n\nExtinction Rebellion climate change protesters dance to music as they block a street at the bottom of Trafalgar Square without arrest\n\nWhile being watched by the police, activists have set up a 'village' with its own improvised cycle lane, food stalls (pictured), and a 'well-being sanctuary' for tired or stressed environmentalists in Trafalgar Square\n\nA group have also placed 800 potted trees outside Parliament, each with the name of an MP attached, as they called on Boris Johnson to plant billions more across the UK\n\nIt took eight police officers to remove a single protester on Millbank today as the Met pledged to arrest anyone who has not yet removed\n\nClimate change activists from Extinction Rebellion protest, and some lay in their tent emblazoned with the Extinction Rebellion logo, near Whitehall in central London\n\nThe activist, in her 20\u2019s, gave herself up peacefully as police moved in at Millbank. As she entered the police van without being handcuffed, she was given a legal booklet by fellow activists informing her of her rights.\n\nPolice have adopted a \u2018softly-softly\u2019 approach to detentions and as she sat in the van, an arresting officer sat beside her looking distinctly bored.\n\nPolice have been seen smiling and chatting with detainees and it is reported that instructions have been given to ensure the non-violent demonstrators are not injured.\n\nOne woman (pictured above) was seen being carried away by a group of officers, many of which have been criticised by people for their 'soft' tactics' during the protests\n\nAfter she was detained, the woman was seen in the back of a police van, with the officer next to her seemingly looking fed up at the situation\n\nA woman laughs with supporters as four police officer drag her to the van after she refused to leave the area outside th Home Office\n\nA similar number of police were required to arrest a woman who refused to move from a road leading to Parliament Square\n\nPolice had hoped to drive all protesters to Parliament Square and on to all pedestrianised areas - but the people, stalls and tents on the roads remain\n\nGrant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, whose building was blockaded this morning, said police were not being 'proactive' enough and were instead 'standing around the edges' as the activists grabbed control.\n\nHe told LBC: 'It cannot be right that people are able to set up tents in the middle of the street and then not simply be removed.\n\n'If you parked your car in the middle of the street, it would be removed and you would be fined. If you refused to move it you would be up in court.\n\n'We cannot have a situation where there are separate sets of rules. Walking in here I can see entire roads blocked with tents set up and the police standing around the edges. I do think that the police need to be perhaps a little bit more pro-active and lean into this.'\n\nActivists have even set up their own cycle lanes in two miles of streets they have shut down in London over the past 24 hours\n\nPolice officers remove an activist from outside the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs with each person refusing to move they need to be lifted\n\nXR rebels are refusing to move and have been trained to remain limp as police carry them away to police vans\n\nProtesters are refusing to cooperate with police and even have advisers to help them 'resist peacefully' when arrested\n\nThese are the two miles of roads in Westminster - marked with dotted lines and stop signs - that have been taken over by activists\n\nThis morning XR members began gluing themselves to the Department for Transport headquarters in Horseferry Road as they pledged to blockade every Government department.\n\nA lorry was also parked in the middle of the road outside the Home Office with activists lying under it - and vegans shouting 'beef equals grief' have forced out Smithfield Market meat traders and are using their stalls to hand out fruit and vegetables.\n\nMet Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said his officers will impose 'new conditions' using the public order act to clear thousands from the streets of Westminster - but just 471 people were held in the past 36 hours.\n\nHe said: 'People can now only lawfully protest in the pedestrianised area of Trafalgar Square - off the road. Anyone else protesting in that Westminster area, linked to Extinction Rebellion, are committing an offence and will be arrested today'.\n\nUp to 30,000 climate change activists are again blocking roads and bridges around Parliament as they attempt to inflict maximum turmoil in the capital.\n\nActivist Mike Gumn, 33, an NHS manager from Bristol, said: 'We will decide as a group when we are going to move, and we are not going to let police tell us when. I would not like to get arrested, but if that happens when I am exercising my right to protest and deliver a good life for my children, then I will take it on the chin.'\n\nOne activist in his 20s outside the Home Office added: 'They (police) came round and told us that we should be moving on. I don't think we are going to move on. It's not a risk if you know you're going to be arrested. It's something I'll do if I need to'.\n\nThere is also growing anger after members pitched tents against the memorial for all the women who served our country in the Second World War on Whitehall.\n\nHis comrade appeared to have glued her hand to the floor as activists plan to disrupt every Government department's building\n\nA protester who has glued his hand to a door as part of an Extinction Rebellion (XR) protest outside the Department for Transport in Horseferry Road, Westminster\n\nA lorry blocks Marsham Street, outside the entrance to the Home Office, another Government department targeted today\n\nProtesters lean their banners, tents and event a lilo against the memorial for all the women who served our country in the Second World War\n\nFormer Tory party treasurer Lord Andrew Fraser confronts protesters in Westminster and shakes his fist at them while wearing his dressing gown this morning\n\nPolice have blocked the road outside the front doors of the Home Office, where an Extinction Rebellion lorry is parked diagonally.\n\nA protester has glued one hand to the ground and the other hand to a bicycle lock around their neck, at Millbank near to the junction with Great College Street\n\nHundreds of protesters are sat at either side of the police blockade, where a few tents from last night's camp out are still pitched.\n\nClaudia Fisher, 57, from Brighton, said: 'We are a little bit crusty, I'll put my hands up to it, after a night sleeping out on the grounds of Whitehall, but we're not unco-operative. We're actually very co-operative.\n\n'We don't take offence, we don't have blame, we don't go around calling people names, that's not the way we do things.\n\n'We actually really value what everyone has to say and would really like to hear what he has to say.\n\n'We'd really like him to show us the same respect and hear what we have to say.'\n\nFormer Metropolitan Police detective sergeant John Curran, 49, who camped overnight at the protests, said he was willing to be arrested again after being detained by officers during the first round of action in April.\n\nMr Curran, who is father to a three-year-old daughter and now makes guitars for a living in Oxford, said: 'I am willing to be arrested again unless some changes happen.\n\n'Clearly there is some frustration (for the police) that they probably have better things to be doing, and I agree, but the responsibility for that must lie with the Government. Take action and we won't have to be here.'\n\nPolice are surrounding protesters but the majority will not move on, which is leading to their eventual arrest\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters demonstrate at Whitehall as dawn breaks on day 2 of their two weeks of protests in London\n\nRow after row of tents line Whitehall with as XR supporters blockade all Government departments in London today\n\nExtinction Rebellion climate protesters were being arrested outside the Home office this morning where a lorry blocked the road\n\n'Food justice' campaigners also set up camp outside the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in Marsham Street\n\nProtesters chained to a hearse during the Extinction Rebellion (XR) protest in Trafalgar Square\n\nProtesters will be allowed to protest in Trafalgar Square, where they have decorated Nelson's Column\n\nA XR activist pokes her head out of her tent to speak to police in a huge camp that has been set up close to Parliament Square by the pressure group\n\nInside the Home Office people glued themselves to the doors including a pair of pensioners who were holding hands\n\nProtesters attached to barrels at the Department Of Business, Energy and Industrial strategy this morning\n\nThe first activist who glued herself to the DfT building brought a book but was not there very long before police arrested her\n\nA young protester smiles as a police officer read her Section 14 of the Public Order Act - warning her she would be arrested unless she left the area\n\nLast night a team of vegans took over London's Smithfield market, shutting out meat traders replacing their wares with fruit and vegetables - but around a mile away some protesters were pictured enjoying meals in McDonald's and Pret.\n\nThe climate change activists, many of whom camped close to Big Ben, are blockading government buildings and demanding what the plans are for the climate emergency\n\nProtest organisers praise rebels for forcing police to 'crank up their response' Organisers behind the protests and occupations across London have praised their supporters and urged them to 'stay clam' through police intervention. This afternoon rebels claimed they were holding 8 of the 12 sites across London and conversation shared between members on their private messaging board reveal just how much of the city they are occupied. In a message to fellow rebels, organisers urged them to 'keep going' and shared a detailed plan of which sites were occupied most. 1: Marsham St - We Are All Crew by far the densest site with 1000 rebels! Tents being encouraged to move by the police but morning dance vibes prevail Gluing on actions occurring at 4 Government buildings within site, but police removal teams are moving fast. Laura the lorry looking threatened with police surround, 70 tents, 12 gazebos. 2: Millbank - the North are under a lot of pressure from police, looking like one roadblock about to go. Most tents packed up, arrests occurring and losing infrastructure. Brave and courageous rebels, we love you! 3: Lambeth Bridge - Big ups to the SW & Faith groups for an immense 12hr stand off yesterday with over 60 arrests. They have now merged with We Are All Crew 4: Horseguards - Love Rebellion feeling loved up 12 gazebos and 70 tents still up, seems calm, infrastructure growing! Kitchen functioning! 5: Whitehall - People's Assembly in progress, Jacob Rees-Mogg just walked past - Strong determined vibes to continue to hold the site! Plenty of tents and rebels 6: Victoria St - The Scots are rocking it! 300+ rebels, holding site comfortably and currently underway with an action of BEIS. 60 tents, kitchen up and running 7: Trafalgar - Sound system on! Energy reviving slowly, lost some infrastructure in the night. Roadblocks good. A little thin on numbers, hoping for more to join 8: Westminster Bridge - After what we thought was a calm settling into night time, the police came back at midnight and cleared the site. Now moved to Plan B and joined Trafalgar. Huge love to the Londoners! 9: The Mall - good vibes currently after a spate of arrests this morning. 50 or so rebels, tents, marquees still up and only few police about. 10: Smithsfield - After a jolly night bedded down in Smithsfield Market, Animal Rebellion to take their 2nd site today on Horseferry Rd! Welcome! 11: St James Park - Global Justice now at St James Park, having a meeting this morning to discuss moving to a 2nd Plan B. 30 or so rebels. And toilets have arrived! 12: The Mall - XR Peace - are up and about and ready to join another site, possibly The Mall \ufffd\ufffd\ufe0f 'All in all... That's 8/12 standing but this could already be old news 'What we are doing is INCREDIBLE. It is HUGE. The news reports are rolling, the people are talking, the politicians are noticing. The fact the police are cranking up response means we are having a much bigger effect. Stay strong Stay calm '\n\nProtesters brought chaos for commuters on Monday, closing down a large area of central London as part of coordinated actions taking place around the world.\n\nMore road closures are expected today as tens of thousands descend on the capital. Parliament Street, Great Smith Street, and Westminster and Lambeth bridges are expected to be heavily affected.\n\nThe Met Police said it had arrested 319 demonstrators by midnight last night, almost three times the 122 arrests made on the first day of similar protests last April.\n\nEco-activists who left London in chaos were branded 'crusties' and 'importunate nose-ringed climate change protesters' by Boris Johnson last night.\n\nThe Prime Minister told Extinction Rebellion demonstrators to 'stop blocking the traffic' as the city centre ground to a halt despite a massive police presence.\n\nOne climate activist has been sat locked to the top of a trailer, parked in Trafalgar Square, for more than 24 hours.\n\nOther demonstrators counted down from 10 and cheered as the milestone was reached.\n\nSpeaking to PA from the roof of the trailer, the activist, Rob, 28, said: 'It's a story to tell my grandchildren.\n\n'It's to show in a completely non-violent way that we're willing to disrupt what we call order now and business as usual. To highlight what needs to be done.\n\n'We won't tolerate business as usual. We mean no harm to anyone we know we're inconveniencing.'\n\nRob, whose legs were both bike-locked to the roof, said that he had also earlier glued his left hand to the roof and had no idea when he would come down.\n\nHe was thrown a small tube of sun cream by a fellow activist.\n\nA group of activists camped at Smithfield Market said they allowed traders to operate.\n\nAnimal Rebellion told the PA news agency: 'Traders were able to operate, yes, we had agreement in place. There were tensions but overall the night went by peacefully and we made clear our message with holding the site.'\n\nExtinction Rebellion activist Glenn Drake, 65, from Lowestoft in Suffolk, brandished a sign which read 'Boris, sort climate change first, (then) prorogue Brexit', at Trafalgar Square on the second day of the two-week long international protests.\n\nMr Drake is a Brexiteer, but said politicians should be prioritising tackling climate change before securing a deal with the EU.\n\nHe said: 'I voted for Brexit, mainly because I don't want to be part of a federal Europe.\n\n'But because of the urgency of climate change, we need to put aside Brexit.\n\n'No-one can agree on it, the country is 50/50 split, so let's put that aside and let's concentrate on the main issue, and that's climate change.'\n\nOfficers arrested 321 protesters who closed bridges and major roads on the first day of a fortnight of action in London.\n\nAmong activists in Trafalgar Square yesterday were celebrities including model Daisy Lowe, comedian Ruby Wax and actors Juliet Stevenson and Mark Rylance.\n\nBut residents, commuters, hospital patients and paramedics reacted with fury at the protests, which brought the capital to a standstill for the second time this year.\n\nExtinction Rebellion climate protesters looked happy to be be attached to a lorry outside the Home Office\n\nActivists were tucked in under duvets and blankets and bound to the lorry with bike locks to make it harder for police to arrest them\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters celebrate after blocking Horseferry Road in central London this morning\n\nTents remain in front of Westminster Abbey today despite threats that they will be thrown in a police van\n\nDemonstrators set up roadblocks on Westminster and Lambeth Bridges, Victoria Street, Whitehall, Horse Guards Road and The Mall. Scotland Yard vowed to take a tougher line after being accused of surrendering the streets to them for more than a week during demonstrations in April.\n\nBut despite the arrests, police failed to move them all and restore order. Those affected up by the protest included the Prime Minister, who spoke at Banqueting House on Whitehall during the launch of the third volume of an official biography of Margaret Thatcher.\n\nAttacking 'the denizens of the heaving hemp-smelling bivouacs that now litter Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park Corner', he said the former prime minister was a 'true feminist green revolutionary' who took greenhouse gases 'seriously long before Greta Thunberg'.\n\nClimate change protester jets in from the US to join animal rights demo at Smithfield Market Vegan documentary maker James Hoot (pictured), 27, flew from his native Maryland to join Animal Rebellion activists camping out at Smithfield meat market in east London today A climate changer protester jetted in from the USA to join animal rights activists occupying London's famous meat market, before admitting he could be seen as a hypocrite for having a high carbon footprint. Vegan documentary maker James Hoot, 27, flew from his native Maryland to join Animal Rebellion demonstrators camping out at Smithfield Market in east London today. He said: 'I'm part of the movement, but I am also making a documentary series on veganism which I travelled to 15 countries to make. 'I flew from the US, but I travel by train in Europe. I feel guilty about the pollution. It is hypocritical. But, there aren't many alternatives to flying these days, and trains aren't that clean either.' Dozens pitched up tents overnight as they waited for traders to arrive in the early hours - only to stop them setting up their stalls by covering them with fruit and vegetables. Smithfield is the biggest meat market in the UK and is usually open from 2am until 8am to supply London's restaurants, cafes and hotels with the best cuts on offer.\n\nPatients and staff at St Thomas' Hospital were stranded, with ambulances struggling to get in or out. One paramedic at the hospital on the south side of Westminster Bridge said the protests caused 'a lot of disruption' and delayed ambulance journeys by up to 15 minutes. The gridlock left one cancer patient stuck outside the hospital for more than an hour because a taxi couldn't get to her.\n\nVeronica Smith, 55, who has lung cancer, attended an appointment at midday to drain her lungs. The care worker from Lewisham, south London, was discharged at 1.45pm but was still stranded at 3pm.\n\nAnother patient, who gave his name as Tony, 66, criticised the activists as he hobbled on a broken foot through the protest to attend an appointment.\n\nHe said: 'My bus should have been stopping outside the hospital. They should be all arrested and water-cannoned. It is absolutely disgraceful. Why do they have to disrupt people's lives?' Meanwhile, delivery driver Shah Kamal, 22, from south London, said he had to abandon his vehicle for more than two hours after being caught up in blockades.\n\nHe fears he may not get paid after failing to complete his deliveries.\n\nHaving started work at 5am, he was still unable to drive over Lambeth Bridge almost 12 hours later. He said: 'I don't think I'm getting home tonight. It is just ridiculous.'\n\nSome London activists glued themselves to scaffolding, and one parked a hearse in Trafalgar Square and locked himself to the steering wheel. They also shut down Smithfield meat market in east London. Mark Rylance gave a speech in which he revealed that his decision to resign from the Royal Shakespeare Company over its sponsorship contract with BP was inspired by teenage activist Greta Thunberg. Addressing a crowd off The Mall, he said: 'The collapse of society is certain.'\n\nActress Juliet Stevenson said: 'All over the world, millions and millions of people's lives are already feeling the impact and livelihoods are being destroyed.' The protesters staged a wedding, did yoga and set up camps with tents during the demonstration to curb global warming.\n\nThey also played cricket outside the Supreme Court, while 'lady vicars' occupying the south side of Lambeth Bridge sang hymns.\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists queue for McDonald's in Westminster - shunning the anti-capitalist ideals of many who joined the protests\n\nExtinction Rebellion posted this graphic online showing where their intended targets would be and where their various groups would gather\n\nPolice attempt to remove two Extinction Rebellion environmental activists locked to the framework of a structure they had built at a site they are calling Global Food Justice' on Lambeth Bridge on Monday evening\n\nUnhappy meat traders have been locked out of Smithfield Market where vegans held a candle-lit vigil for all dead animals and put out fruit and veg on the stalls\n\nTwo women appear to enjoy a glass of wine and a meal of tomatoes and peppers this morning after occupying Smithfield Market, which is a sea of tents and fruit and veg today\n\nExtinction Rebellion claims the protests could be five times bigger than those in April, which brought major disruption to London and saw more than 1,100 arrests.\n\nIt cost Scotland Yard \u00a316million to police the earlier demonstrations \u2013 enough to pay the salaries of 600 bobbies.\n\nYesterday, Downing Street said protesters who 'significantly disrupt the lives of others' should feel the 'full force of the law'. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'It is essential that people can continue to go about their business. The right to peaceful protest does not extend to unlawful activity.\n\n'The Government expects police to take a firm stance against protesters who significantly disrupt the lives of others and to use the full force of the law.'\n\nHowever, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell backed the activists, tweeting: 'Solidarity #ExtinctionRebellion.'\n\nResponding to a video of a protester resisting arrest, National Crime Agency chief Lynne Owens tweeted that Met Police officers 'should not have to endure this sort of behaviour'. She added: 'No cause can justify the assaulting of another human being.'\n\nThe protest is part of an 'international rebellion' taking place in cities including Berlin, Madrid, Amsterdam and New York.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said in a statement: 'As dawn broke , many thousands of people from around the world entered a new phase of rebellion against planetary inaction. Groups across 60 cities began blocking roads, bridges and transport links with the intention of remaining until our voices are heard.'\n\nAs evening descended on the capital, activists could still be seen on Westminster Bridge holding a large banner saying 'This is Change.'\n\nAnd close to Westminster Abbey more tents were pitched up as protesters could be seen playing music and dancing after the first day of protests drew to a close.\n\nIn response to claims the police have been outnumbered by protesters, a spokesman for the Met said: 'The Met has taken a robust stance in policing this protest with over 270 arrests made so far and the seizure of equipment that prevents sustained and unlawful protest and will continue to arrest.\n\n'We have a proportionate policing plan in place and relevant resources to deal with any incidents that may arise, however, whilst we have a significant number of officers policing the protests, we also have to ensure that enough officers remain on their boroughs to continue to carry out day-to-day policing and protect the wider community.'\n\nThe Red Brigade of The Invisible Circus surround police in Westminster yesterday on the first day of XR chaos in London\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters remove a structure from Lambeth Bridge on Monday evening ahead of further protests this week\n\nYesterday was the first day of a planned fortnight of disruption by Extinction Rebellion, bringing chaos to London as they shut down key routes in the city.\n\nProtesters were joined by eco-luvvies Daisy Lowe, Mark Rylance, Ruby Wax and Juliet Stevenson in Trafalgar Square as they shut down the landmark.\n\nFor the next two weeks XR - which has posted details and maps of its planned disruptions in advance - intends to cripple the capital with 276 protesters arrested already since the protests began.\n\nOne senior member warned ahead of the protests that if police shut them down: 'We have other plans that are more disruptive'.\n\nMinisters are understood to be looking at whether protesters who damage parts of London can be held financially responsible. In an Extinction Rebellion stunt last week, fake blood was sprayed over the Treasury \u2013 although much of it ended up going back over the demonstrators themselves.\n\nPolice officers in Trafalgar Square use angle grinders and de-bonder to release to Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists who locked and glued themselves together\n\nActor Mark Rylance joined Extinction Rebellion protesters in The Mall where supporters of the environmental group invaded during the Changing of the Guard\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists marking the 'opening ceremony' of their protest in Trafalgar Square were joined by Ruby Wax, Juliet Stevenson and Daisy Lowe (left to right)\n\nOne government source suggested a mechanism could be bringing a civil action to hurt demonstrators 'in their wallets'. 'There is discussion about whether we can ensure they are bearing the cost,' the source said. 'Democratic protests is one thing, but you cannot wreck listed buildings.'\n\nHowever, actress Juliet Stevenson called the protests 'wonderful', adding: 'We can't any longer allow governments to do this so we have to make it clear that there is no more time.\n\n'There's a long tradition in this country of people saying governments are not acting, we have to make them realise how urgent this is.'\n\nShe told MailOnline that said she had been swayed to join the protests as she wanted a future for the planet and her four children. She said she felt a duty to do what she could to help stop environmental damage and climate change.\n\nStevenson said: 'My children are saying they are not sure they want to have children when the planet is in such danger. I have a one-year-old grandchild too and I want to help ensure all of their futures.' We have 12 years before the planet is irreversibly damaged. The scientists have warned about it.'\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion couple getting married at an action site that is being called 'The Beacon' on Westminster Bridge\n\nDaisy Lowe (second left) posed next to Big Ben with friends including actress Jaime Winstone (far right), popstar Eliza Caird, best known as Eliza Doolittle (centre right), and TV producer Emily Ann Sonnet (far left)\n\nGood Lord what a racket!
