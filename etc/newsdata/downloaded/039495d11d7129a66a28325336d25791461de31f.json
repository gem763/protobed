(AP) - The festivals are over and Earthlings from around the globe headed home Sunday after a weekend camping and partying in the dusty Nevada desert and trekking to remote gates of Area 51, a formerly top-secret U.S. military base long the focus of UFO and space alien lore.\n\nThey left in peace, officials and the host of a free \u201cAlienstock\u201d festival said Sunday.\n\nVisitors hailed from France, Russia, Germany, Peru, Sweden, Australia and many U.S. states - many toting YouTube cameras - in answer to an internet post in June suggesting that if enough people rushed a military base to \u201csee them aliens\u201d at 3 a.m. Sept. 20, authorities couldn\u2019t stop everyone.\n\nMore than 2 million Facebook users clicked their interest, but in the end only a few thousand made the trip to the tiny Nevada desert city of Rachel, population about 50, a more than two-hour drive north of Las Vegas.\n\nCampers and festival-goers in Rachel peaked at about 3,000 on Friday, said Eric Holt, the Lincoln County official who headed planning for a feared influx of at least 30,000.\n\nA few hundred more camped and attended one night of an abbreviated festival about 40 miles (64 kilometers) away in Hiko, population 120.\n\n\u201cIt seems like a lot of good people chilling and having a good time,\u201d observed Dave Wells, a 56-year-old stonemason and festivals-seeker from Cincinnati wearing a day-glow green festival T-Shirt and taking in the scene Saturday in Rachel.\n\nDid anyone find actual extraterrestrials or UFOs? (As if anyone could really tell among the masked and costumed beings posing for photos and cavorting in the desert.)\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t,\u201d said Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn owner-turned-\u201cAlienstock\u201d festival host Connie West, proprietor of the 10-room motel and cafe that became the center of the extraterrestrial-seeking universe.\n\n\u201cBut we found peace. And friendship,\u201d she said Sunday as campers packed up to leave and volunteers began cleaning up.\n\nAnother event, dubbed \u201cArea 51 Basecamp\u201d at the Alien Research Center souvenir shop in Hiko, didn\u2019t fare as well.\n\nOrganizers pulled the plug Saturday on a second concert after drawing only about 500 ticket-buyers for a Friday show. Preparations had been made for up to 5,000.\n\nAuthorities said more than 1,000 people visited Area 51 gates near Rachel on Thursday and Friday. Officials didn\u2019t report the number on Saturday. Holt said Lincoln County sheriff\u2019s deputies on the public side of the gates were sent home early Sunday.\n\nIn the end, no one actually \u201cstormed\u201d Area 51, although deputies in rural Nye County resorted to \u201cheated warnings\u201d to disperse as many as 200 people who gathered before dawn Friday near a conspicuously green \u201cArea 51 Alien Center\u201d in Amargosa Valley, Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said. No one was arrested.\n\nA permit for a festival at that site, which is about a 90-minute drive west of Las Vegas, was denied by county officials.\n\nIn Lincoln County, six people were arrested during the weekend for misdemeanors, mostly trespassing beneath the floodlights and cameras of two military base gates and the watchful eyes of sheriff\u2019s deputies from far-flung corners of Nevada.\n\nSheriff Kerry Lee said he watched about 20 people feign a rush before dawn Saturday toward a base gate outside Rachel, before stopping short.\n\nTwo men were detained by military security officers inside the perimeter of the vast Nevada Test and Training Range, an area almost twice the size of Delaware where the U.S. Air Force conducts aerial combat and bomb training, and tests stealth aircraft. The men were turned over to sheriff\u2019s deputies and charged with trespassing, Lee said, and their vehicle was impounded.\n\nHolt said three people critically hurt in rollover crashes during the weekend were sent to hospitals in Las Vegas and St. George, Utah. Motorists involved in crashes that killed two cows on the open range escaped serious injury.\n\nAt a festival clinic in Rachel, one man was treated Friday for dehydration, and one woman was treated early Sunday for drug-related issue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to call it a success from our end. It\u2019s because we got out in front of it,\u201d said Varlin Higbee, a rancher and Lincoln County commissioner who signed an emergency declaration earlier this month.\n\nOfficials had feared unruly crowds would overwhelm water, electricity, food, fuel, internet and telephone service in a county with just 5,200 people covering an area the size of Massachusetts.\n\nHigbee said commissioners who allocated $250,000 in emergency funds to brace for trouble might sue to recoup costs.\n\n\u201cThink about it,\u201d Higbee said. \u201cHere\u2019s an illegal event, supporting an illegal activity - storming the gate. We\u2019re not sure what we\u2019re going to do at this point.\u201d\n\nHe , compared the initial internet post to an incitement to violence.\n\nMatty Roberts, the 20-year-old from Bakersfield, California, has acknowledged his \u201cstorm Area 51\u201d Facebook post in June was a hoax.\n\nBut he promoted events in Rachel before breaking earlier this month with West.\n\nHe said Sunday that Lincoln County officials didn\u2019t have to spend money and could have simply prevented events in Rachel and Hiko by denying permits, like Nye County did in Amargosa Valley.\n\nRoberts hosted a Thursday evening event at an outdoor venue in downtown Las Vegas, also using the \u201cAlienstock\u201d name. He said he wants to trademark the name and take it on tour to reach people who couldn\u2019t travel to Nevada.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much the plan for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a ton of fun.\u201d\n\nWest, in Rachel, said she\u2019s open to holding her festival again next year.\n\n\u201cAs well as it turned out? Why the heck not?\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The festivals are over and Earthlings from around the globe headed home Sunday after a weekend camping and partying in the dusty Nevada desert and trekking to remote gates of Area 51, a formerly top-secret U.S. military base long the focus of UFO and space alien lore.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ken Ritter"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/storm_area_51_events_03367_c0-191-5288-3274_s1770x1032.jpg?2a11e9ad060bc5de2490d1779b8e4f57e6304d00", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
