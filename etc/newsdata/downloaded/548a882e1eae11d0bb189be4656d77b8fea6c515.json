'But when it comes down to it, I felt - Bob (De Niro) felt - the picture had to be made for ourselves.'\n\nPals: Scorsese and Pacino looked in high spirits as they posed together on the red carpet\n\nCollaboration: Scorsese posed for a photo with the film's producer Emma Tillinger Koskoff\n\nScorsese described the CGI used to digitally de-age De Niro, Pacino and Pesci in his new film as 'an evolution of make-up' at the event.\n\nHe said: 'If we made the film earlier they could have played younger but at a certain point we missed that and then they said \"use younger actors\" and I said \"what\u2019s the point of that?\" CGI is really an evolution of make-up, you accept certain norms in make-up, you know he\u2019s not that old, she\u2019s not that young, you accept the illusion.'\n\nPacino added: 'I saw the film without any work, without effects and it was fine. I\u2019m not the only one who felt that way. I think it\u2019s really good we have it, we have this potential and it\u2019s exercised in the film.\n\n'In the old days they put an actor we all knew and love and put grey hair on him and we would be like \"oh he got older\", and you accept it because it\u2019s in the story.'\n\nGangster's dinner: De Niro went for dinner with Pacino and their co-star Harvey Keitel, 80, at Scott's restaurant in Mayfair on Friday\n\nA jolly affair: Al (left) and Harvey (right) joined De Niro as he headed to Scott's just hours after giving an interview about the new film all three of them star in\n\nDe Niro said: 'I always joke my career will be extended another 30 years, where it will evolve. I am just happy we are at the beginning stages of it being explored and God knows where we will go and what excited me about it was Pablo (Helman, the visual effects supervisor) was doing this thing and wanted to make it state of the art, the best it could be.'\n\nScorsese explained of the fact that the film will stream on Netflix after the company agreed to foot the bill for the expensive CGI: 'Having the backing of a company that says you will have no interference, the trade-off is it streams with theatrical distribution prior to that, I thought that is the chance we take.'\n\n'The new technology is bringing things that are unimaginable and not only is it something extraordinarily good for narrative films, narrative stores told emphasising motion picture images, but it opens up the original conception of what a film is and how it is to be seen has now changed so radically.\n\nAll-black ensemble: The Irishman, which has a running time of 209 minutes, has already won rave reviews from critics\n\n'One thing that should always be protected as much as possible, and I think will always be there, is a communal experience and I think that is best in a theatre.\n\n'Homes are becoming theatres too but it\u2019s a major change and I think one has to keep an open mind. There is no doubt seeing a film with an audience is really important.'\n\nOf Marvel-type movies he said: 'The value of a film that is like a theme park film, Marvel-type pictures, where theatres become amusement parks, that\u2019s a different experience.\n\n'It\u2019s not cinema, it\u2019s something else, we shouldn\u2019t be invaded by it, so that is a big issue and we need the theatre owners to step up to allow theatres to show films that are narrative films.'\n\nCan't stop smiling: Pacino couldn't keep the smile from his face as he strolled out of the London restaurant in a grey baseball cap and navy coat\n\nPared back: De Niro wore the same pared back outfit from his earlier interview at the British Film Institution - black chinos with a navy polo shirt and a zip-up hoodie\n\nThe event comes after De Niro, Pacino and their co-star Harvey Keitel, 80, all enjoyed dinner at Mayfair seafood restaurant on Friday night.\n\nThe trio headed to Scott's just hours after De Niro gave an interview about the new crime film.\n\nAnd the three actors all have their fair share of experience when it comes to classic gangster blockbusters.\n\nDe Niro shot to success overnight when he was cast in the Godfather Part II (1974) alongside Pacino, while Keitel hit the big time after performing in Mean Streets (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976).\n\nDevoted fans: Keitel and De Niro stopped to sign autographs for devoted fans who had managed to track the trio down\n\nCrime-drama opus: The Irishman premiered on September 27 at the New York Film Festival, finally raising the curtain on the director's long-awaited, 209-minute crime-drama opus\n\nRelaxed and put together: De Niro cut a casual figure in black chinos, a navy polo shirt and simple loafers\n\nThe three acclaimed actors looked in high spirits as they walked out of the high-end seafood restaurant flanked by security.\n\nPacino looked particularly jolly and couldn't keep the smile off his face as he strolled out of the London restaurant.\n\nAnd Keitel and De Niro stopped to sign autographs for devoted fans who had managed to track the trio down.\n\nPacino looked put-together yet casual in a relaxed ensemble that featured a grey baseball cap, blue coat and black scarf.\n\nThe Heat star accessorised his look with some chunky silver rings and black and white trainers.\n\n'An interesting hybrid': Scorsese called his film 'an interesting hybrid' as both something made for theatres and for watching at home\n\n'Extraordinary time of change': 'All of us now are in an extraordinary time of change,' Scorsese said.
