None are ever spared\u201d.\n\nThe slaughter at Vestmanna is the eleventh hunt on the Faroe islands this year - with more than 600 pilot whales slaughtered so far in 2019, Sea Shepherd said.\n\nIn September last year, the charity offered the Faroe Islands \u20ac1m (\u00a3910,000) for 10 consecutive years if there were no whale hunts, but the offer was rejected.\n\nLong finned pilot whales are not recognised as being endangered due to a lack of data on the species. The IUCN status is listed as \u201cdata deficient\u201d. Various estimates put remaining numbers of individuals at well under a million.", "description": "Almost 100 whales have been brutally slaughtered in a five-hour hunt which culminated in 12 minutes of killing on the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic.
