Police moved in and made several arrests.\n\nChek Lap Kok, built around a tiny outlying island in the dying days of British colonial rule, is one of the world\u2019s busiest and most efficient airports, reached by a series of bridges which were packed with traffic.\n\n\u201cIf we disrupt the airport, more foreigners will read the news about Hong Kong,\u201d said one 20-year-old protester, asking not to be named.\n\nRelated Coverage Trains to Hong Kong airport suspended amid protester disruption\n\nBlack-clad demonstrators targeted the airport three weeks ago, jamming the terminal in sometimes violent clashes with police and prompting some flights to be canceled or delayed.\n\nPolice said on Sunday protesters hurled iron poles, bricks and rocks on to the railway track near the airport station. By early evening protesters at the airport had left, but protesters in Tung Chung remained.\n\n\u201cWe have no idea how to leave. We\u2019re stuck,\u201d a masked protester said, as others looked for buses and ferries to get back home.\n\nPolice and protesters had clashed overnight in some of the most intense violence since unrest erupted more than three months ago over concerns Beijing is eroding the autonomy granted to the territory when it was handed back to China in 1997.\n\nChina denies the charge of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy.\n\nTourist numbers have plummeted in recent weeks and international trade fairs canceled as the territory faces its first recession in a decade.\n\nAirport security guards hold the gate to stop the anti-extradition bill protesters from entering the Hong Kong Airport, in Hong Kong, China, September 1, 2019.

It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.\n\nSeveral hundred demonstrators also gathered outside the British consulate in central Hong Kong, waving Union Jack flags and chanting \u201cGod save the Queen\u201d.\n\nSUBWAY VIOLENCE\n\nParts of the metro system ground to a halt as skirmishes spread to the subway on Saturday, with television showing images of people being beaten as they cowered on the floor behind umbrellas. Police said they arrested 63 people aged between 13 and 36.\n\nAmnesty International said the metro violence should be investigated.\n\nThe protests came on the fifth anniversary of China\u2019s decision to curtail democratic reforms and rule out universal suffrage in Hong Kong.\n\nThe unrest began in mid-June, fueled by anger over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.\n\nSlideshow (35 Images)\n\nBut the turmoil has evolved over 13 weeks to become a widespread demand for greater democracy.\n\nProtesters have called for a general strike on Monday, but it was not immediately clear how many people would take part.", "description": "Thousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport on Sunday in a bid to draw world attention to their fight for democracy for the Chinese-ruled city which is facing its biggest political crisis in decades.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190901&t=2&i=1425156666&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8022B"}
