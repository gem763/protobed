He looks constipated here admitting that, yes, of course police intervention might be required in some cases. It\u2019s called a \u201cmandatory\u201d buyback for a reason. What\u2019s the alternative, \u201cTurn in your guns if you feel like it?\u201d A law is only as good as its enforcement.\n\n.@BetoORourke on his gun confiscation plan: \u201cHas to be consequences\u201d for noncompliance; \"in that case I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm\" pic.twitter.com/U5PywOgw9D \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) October 16, 2019\n\nI can\u2019t tell if this is the same position he held last month or a new one. In September, when he first went all-in on gun confiscation, he assured skeptics that police wouldn\u2019t go door to door confiscating guns. Instead, it seemed, assault weapons would be treated like other forms of contraband, e.g., drugs. The cops won\u2019t randomly show up to your door asking about it, but if they happen to find contraband in your possession while they\u2019re there on other business, you\u2019re in trouble. Listening to O\u2019Rourke now, it sounds like he does imagine the police being sent out in some cases, at least, for the express purpose of confiscating weapons.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t really a surprise. Beto\u2019s views on gun rights have been evolving at light speed since he was a Senate candidate in Texas.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to watch the skepticism he\u2019s getting even from Democratic-friendly media over his gun proposal. It\u2019s not just Scarborough. Check out the pushback he got from Alisyn Camerota of CNN this morning:\n\nShock: CNN\u2019s Camerota calls out Beto \u2014 \u201cyou expect mass shooters to follow the law?\u201d \u201cMass shooters by definition don\u2019t follow the law.\u201d pic.twitter.com/SwxdDFeLaO \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) October 16, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s no upside, only downside, for liberals at this point in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s quixotic attempt to gain traction in the primary by venting the progressive id. Grab the guns, tax the churches, tear down the border wall \u2014 the media no doubt sees value in these ideas, but they also recognize how poisonous they might be in a general election. It\u2019d be one thing if O\u2019Rourke had caught fire among Democratic voters and now needed media protection from Republican attacks as the presumptive nominee, but not only is he going nowhere electorally, he\u2019s handing the GOP ammo against Elizabeth Warren or whoever else happens to end up facing Trump. He\u2019s so far out in left field that opportunists like Pete Buttigieg are now using O\u2019Rourke\u2019s radicalism as a foil to reposition themselves as moderate pragmatists for the benefit of Joe Biden\u2019s voters:\n\nPete Buttigieg to Beto O'Rourke: \"I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal\" #DemDebate https://t.co/CvrxIAB93e \ud83d\udcf9CNN pic.twitter.com/n66NJ5CFGy \u2014 Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) October 16, 2019\n\nWhat is this guy\u2019s long-term game plan? His presidential bid has failed and he\u2019s so tainted by outlandish radicalism like \u201cseize the guns\u201d that the nominee won\u2019t even want him as a prominent surrogate next year. Having him around on the trail will make it too easy for Trump to tar him/her by association. If he goes back to Texas, he\u2019s finished for the foreseeable future as being too left-wing for what\u2019s still a semi-solidly red state. Is he trying to establish himself as the most true-blue progressive culture warrior in the field ahead of a 2024 presidential run, believing that the party will have caught up to him by then? Or is this exactly what it looks like \u2014 a desperate candidate who made a high-risk bet that radicalism would generate momentum for him, and who\u2019s now left with nowhere to go upon realizing that it hasn\u2019t?", "description": "Confiscation.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/b-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
