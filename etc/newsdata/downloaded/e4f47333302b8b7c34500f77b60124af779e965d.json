On Tuesday, Biles led the American women to their fifth consecutive gold medal in the team competition, becoming the most decorated woman, with 21 career medals. Two days later, she steamrollered her rivals in the all-around event, cruising to a first-place finish by an impressive margin of 2.1 points. On Saturday, she tied Scherbo by claiming the gold in the vault.\n\nPerhaps most impressive? Of her 25 career medals at worlds, 19 were golds.\n\nBiles began her senior gymnastics career in 2013. That year, at 16, she earned her first four medals at the world championships in Antwerp, Belgium, including golds in the all-around and the floor exercise.\n\nIn 2016, Biles\u2019s four gold medals and generally dominant showing at the 2016 Olympic Games made her an international celebrity. Her profile most likely will only grow next summer in Tokyo, where she is widely expected to add to her collection of five Olympic medals.\n\nRather than showing signs of slowing down or resting on her laurels, she has continued to innovate and improve, widening the already prodigious gap between her and her competitors.", "description": "Golds in the balance beam and floor exercise Sunday gave Biles 25 career world championship medals, the most among men and women.", "authors": ["Andrew Keh"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/sports/13bileswins-promo2/13bileswins-promo2-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
