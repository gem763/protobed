Donald Trump famously invented his own fictional spokesman, John Barron, in the 1980s. Internet wags have joked that perhaps Barron could offer some PR advice to the newly unmasked Vara.", "description": "Peter Navarro, a key architect of President Trump's trade policy, made up one of the people the adviser repeatedly quotes in his nonfiction books.
