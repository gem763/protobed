There is no other way to handle so treacherous an adversary.\n\nU.S. warriors have been dying in the benighted land of South-Central Asia since George W. Bush sent them into action against the Islamic radicals who harbored the attack\u2019s masterminds. There is no denying the temptation to accept an imperfect deal that would bring the incessant warfare to an end. Mr. Trump\u2019s recent peace-talk ministrations suggest he is not immune to the lure of withdrawing from the painful conflict that has claimed the lives of 2,300 U.S. troops since 2001, including 16 this year. But he hasn\u2019t thrown in the towel \u2014 yet.\n\nOver the weekend, the president tweeted a frank account of a peace deal near-miss that surprised even Washington\u2019s foreign-policy officialdom: \u201cUnbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday . Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people. I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations. What kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d\n\nThe attack Mr. Trump referenced featured a Taliban suicide bombing last week that targeted a military vehicle, killing two NATO troops, including one American, and 10 civilians. If, as the president suggested, the murders were meant to cow the allies into suing for peace, it accomplished the opposite: Mr. Trump blew off his secret meeting with Taliban and Afghan government leaders.\n\nBristling over the particulars of the gathering has since ensued. Some Republicans have questioned how the president could think it proper to sit down on the eve of September 11 with those who harbored Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda cadre. \u201cCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,\u201d tweeted Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming. \u201cNo member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.\u201d She\u2019s dead right.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who engages in the dicey art of diplomacy, defended the now-canceled confab, but made clear that no withdrawal of U.S. troops will occur without Taliban reassurance that violence will diminish and that there will be no recurrent use of Afghanistan as a stage for U.S. attacks. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to withdraw our forces without making sure we achieve President Trump\u2019s twin objectives,\u201d he said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nJohn Bolton, whose job as national security adviser included checking for diplomatic flaws that could kill Americans, pressed for a no-frills plan of drawing down troop levels in Afghanistan from the current 14,000 to the president\u2019s goal of 8,600 \u2014 without resorting to a handshake with the Taliban. At loggerheads over Afghanistan and other security issues, the president and Mr. Bolton parted ways on Tuesday.\n\nThe president must weigh competing views and chart a course that first secures the American homeland from attack by its mortal enemies and second, repatriates the nation\u2019s military sons and daughters without losing one additional life needlessly. Mr. Trump readjusted and reframed his priorities on the White House lawn Monday afternoon, telling the assembled press, \u201cWe\u2019ll get out, but we\u2019ll get out at the right time.\u201d\n\nMore important than the Afghanistan peace-talk venue is the peace-talk contents. And just as crucial as its contents is verification that the organization\u2019s fighters have lived up to its terms. There should be no further discussions with the Taliban \u2014 at Camp David or anywhere else \u2014 until its leaders first offer a pledge of peace in the form of a ceasefire. There should be no withdrawal of U.S. forces until a lengthy time period has passed \u2014 measured in years, not months \u2014 during which the Taliban has proved it has honored its pledge.\n\nOnly when those who gave safe haven to the terrorists of September 11 have verified their desire to live in peace should Americans lower their guard and bequeath their trust.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
