Well, yes and no, but Google is extremely proud decision to outfit its new flagship with a primary 12 megapixel sensor, and a secondary 16 megapixel telephoto lens (plus a front-facing camera, naturally).\n\nTo demonstrate how hyped the tech juggernaut is on their decision to omit a third wide-angle lens, as featured in Apples\u2019 latest offerings, Google recruited legendary portrait photographer to Annie Leibovitz to discuss her year-long project using Pixel cameras.\n\nShot by Annie Leibovitz on the Google Pixel 4 #madebygoogle pic.twitter.com/NgAirm2lAM \u2014 Gizmodo (@Gizmodo) October 15, 2019\n\nAs you can see by that there shot of the Milky Way, Google is touting its latest tech as capable of seriously impressive Night Sight photography.\n\nGoogle reckons the added camera also assists in Portrait mode, which previously relied on Android tech to generate those slick depth of field effects.\n\nFirst selfie from Pixel 4 ???? pic.twitter.com/bfBsww6zLS \u2014 Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) October 15, 2019\n\nThen there\u2019s the juiced HDR+ functions, which will let users see how their auto-edited piccies will look before hitting the shutter button.\n\nOther goodies include radar (!!!) capabilities, which will enable the Pixel 4 to sense when a user is approaching and ready its facial-recognition systems for nearly instantaneous unlocking. If you\u2019re into that kind of thing.\n\nThe same tech will permit waving gestures to interact with certain apps, meaning you could turn off a timer or head to the next Spotify track with a single off-phone gesture. Neat.\n\nAlong with the hefty improvements to Google Assistant, which now runs many functions locally without the need to link to a server, Google says the new handsets can accurately turn English speech into text in real-time. That\u2019s good news for scrubs like me, who still faces the indignity of transcribing my own voice during interviews, but it could be a life-saver for students in lectures, too.\n\nLocal voice transcription on Google Pixel 4 pic.twitter.com/COfJEY9CJS \u2014 Grubb (@JeffGrubb) October 15, 2019\n\nThe Pixel 4 goes on pre-sale today before its Aussie arrival on October 4. The 5.7 inch screen model will set you back $1049, or $1279 for the XL with 6.3 inches of glass. Whether that\u2019s enticing enough to lure new phone-buyers from Apple is yet to be seen.\n\nREAD MORE Australia Bans Video Games For Stuff We See On TV Daily 'Coz Virtual Weed Is Also Illegal", "description": "The new phone has two rear-facing cameras, opposed to Apple's preference for three.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/pixel-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
