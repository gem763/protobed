The property was allegedly listed for $14 million.\n\n\"His dream and his vision is to move there,\" Kardashian told Jimmy Fallon during her interview Wednesday. \"I love L.A. So I envision summers, I envision some weekends but, yeah, we love it.\"\n\nWhile Kardashian admitted Wyoming is \"the prettiest place you've ever seen in your entire life,\" the reality star and entrepreneur also revealed that she didn't super love the ranch when West first showed it to her.\n\n\"He took me to go see it for the first time, like, maybe a week ago, before he bought it, wanted my opinion. So it's, like, you know, 5,000 acres or something so, we're driving, driving, driving up,\" Kardashian explained to Fallon. She added, \"We brought three of the kids. We go up to this cabin at the top. No electricity. iPads died.\"\n\nKardashian then explained that West fell asleep (as he usually does). \"So now I'm with the three kids, no bathroom,\" said Kardashian. \"So, there's now no lights. I'm scared to death that a bear or something's gonna come.\"\n\n\"My phone dies. There is literally, like, no service. No nothing. I'm peeing in a bottle because there is, like, no bathrooms,\" continued Kardashian.\n\nHowever, while her first night on the ranch was a nightmare for her, things began to look up the next morning. \"I am just, like, losing my mind,\" shared Kardashian. \"Wake up. We, like, make breakfast on a fire thing and we go down to the bottom of the hill and realize that there is a whole hotel, and a whole cabin, and a whole thing that had been built. He just wanted a romantic little night for us up above and I'm like, that's not my vision of romance, babe.\"\n\nSo, in the end, Kardashian realized that the investment wasn't so bad after all and, honestly, if West was trying to sell the idea to his wife right off the bat, he should have just pulled a Drake and been like \u2013 started from the bottom, now we're here.
