I\u2019m shooting outdoors a lot, so the most important thing is the sunscreen \u2014 I use Neutrogena SPF 100+.\u201d\n\nAnd the actress uses it a lot, every 90 minutes to be exact.\n\n\u201cI reapply every 90 minutes, every single day\u201d she told the publication.\n\nThe sunscreen is one of Neutrogena\u2019s best-selling products and boasts a light-weight feel, fast absorbency and Helioplex Technology that offers superior protection from UVA rays.\n\nUltra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 100+ by Neutrogena.

Feels smooth on the skin (velvety), non greasy and hydrating. Good for everyday city life. Goes nicely under light make up (possibly heavy makeup to but haven't tried it yet)\u201d reads one five-star review.\n\nAnother says: \u201cThis product feels light, absorbs well and smells great. Also works, you don't burn. Would never go past this product now, worth every penny\u201d.\n\nAlthough we\u2019re sure Kidman has used an array of expensive products in the past, the actress, who has been a global ambassador for Neutrogena since 2017, just proved you don\u2019t need to spend insane amounts of money to get high-quality skincare.\n\nShop the sunscreen\n\nWatch the latest videos from Yahoo Style UK:", "description": "Shop the actresses affordable skincare favourite now", "authors": ["Sabrina Carder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XIJTlUSBNt8WZXq.bxwFug--~B/aD03NjU7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/cee8eb20-f731-11e9-b6b3-9ad53fb39bfd", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
