The Model S had previously fallen short of earning top marks from IIHS, and the Model X was never tested by the nonprofit group,\n\nThe Model 3 is the second battery electric car to earn the award, as Audi\u2019s E-Tron was the first to earn the honor back in August. Like the E-Tron, the Model 3 earned \u201cgood\u201d ratings in all categories, which is the best distinction the IIHS gives out. The Model 3 was only really dinged in two places. IIHS said that pre-June 2018 versions of the car only had \u201cacceptable\u201d headlights. And on all models, the group said there\u2019s a \u201cmoderate risk of injury to the left lower leg\u201d of the driver in head-on crashes that overlap with the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle (which IIHS says is one of the most challenging tests).\n\nTesla\u2019s automatic emergency braking system also performed well, according to the IIHS, avoiding collisions in both the 12 mph and 25 mph tests.\n\nIn a blog post, Tesla took pride in how the Model 3\u2019s all-glass roof held up during the IIHS tests, and also pointed to the fact that its seats \u2014 which are designed in-house \u2014 helped the car score such high marks.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our customers is what matters most, which is why our active safety features and passive safety equipment come standard on all of our cars,\u201d the company wrote.\n\nFull results, videos, and photos of IIHS\u2019s test of the Model 3 can be found on the nonprofit group\u2019s website.\n\nCorrection: The Model 3 and Audi E-Tron were both awarded IIHS\u2019s \u201ctop safety pick+,\u201d not \u201ctop safety pick,\u201d which the group uses to denote a lower accomplishment.", "description": "Tesla often touts that its cars are really safe, but the company has just received a specific recognition of that safety for the first time ever: the Model 3 was just awarded \"top safety pick\" from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).
