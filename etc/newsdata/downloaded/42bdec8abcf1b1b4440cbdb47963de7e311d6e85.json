Salaciousness abounds. Their book is lurid, informative and aptly subtitled \u201cDonald Trump and the Making of a Predator\u201d.\n\nTrump accuser says she has documents corroborating sexual assault claims Read more\n\nFortunately for us, the authors bring unique expertise. Levine is a former executive editor of the National Enquirer. According to the investigative reporter Ronan Farrow, Trump\u2019s secrets were stashed in a safe in Levine\u2019s office until they were shredded in December 2016 \u2013 a claim the Enquirer denies. El-Faizy is the author of God and Country, which examined the rise of the evangelical community in the aftermath of George W Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election.\n\nAll the President\u2019s Women is breezy but heavy. Unlike Stormy Daniels\u2019 2018 bestseller Full Disclosure, none of it is entertaining. Not surprisingly, the White House declined multiple opportunities to rebut the book\u2019s contentions.\n\nIt takes us from Trump\u2019s days growing up in Queens to his arrival in the Oval Office and chronicles everything in between, mommy and daughter issues included. Much has been heard before, some is aired for the first time, little is pleasant, plenty is disturbing.\n\nThe book rests upon firsthand interviews, transcripts and prior reports. It also contains a detailed appendix that lays out its sources. Said differently, if you can actually believe Barack Obama is a crypto-Muslim born in Kenya to a cocaine-addled Martian, then opting in to at least 50% of All the President\u2019s Women should be a no-brainer.\n\nCourt records abound. It is not just the authors\u2019 word or a birth certificate. Think Summer Zervos, Michael Cohen and \u201cIndividual-1\u201d for starters.\n\nDespite all Trump\u2019s protestations and legal maneuvers, the lawsuit commenced in New York by Zervos, a one-time Apprentice contestant who was allegedly manhandled and defamed, proceeds apace. Since the case began in early 2017, the defendant has never submitted a sworn statement denying the substance of the complaint.\n\nIn March 2019, a New York appeals court gave its greenlight for Zervos\u2019s action to continue. Earlier this month the trial court set a 6 December discovery cut-off, with the possibility of Trump being deposed.\n\nPractically speaking, don\u2019t bet on it. Like Bill Clinton before him, Trump will probably continue to assert that a sitting president cannot be sued, an argument rejected by the supreme court when Clinton squared off against Paula Jones. It is also possible Trump will claim that being deposed while being impeached is more than one man should be forced to bear. There, he may have a point.\n\nMore ominously for Trump, on Thursday Zervos filed a motion with the court that outlined a series of sexual assaults in late 2007 allegedly perpetrated by Trump. For good measure, the results of a polygraph are included. According to Zervos, in one instance Trump \u201cbegan kissing\u201d her \u201cvery aggressively\u201d, then pawed at her. Zervos also attached portions of Trump\u2019s calendar. Barron Trump, the president\u2019s son with Melania, was less than two years old at the time.\n\nIt is unlikely All the President\u2019s Women will change many, if any, minds about Trump\n\nOn top of that, there is Cohen\u2019s guilty plea that essentially paints the president AKA \u201cIndividual-1\u201d as an unindicted co-conspirator in a campaign finance scheme to keep Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model (\u201cWoman-1\u201d), and Daniels, a porn star (\u201cWoman-2\u201d), out of the headlines. The plan worked well enough. The two women were neither seen nor heard until the presidential race was over.\n\nAmong the book\u2019s more questionable vignettes is a story of a younger Trump, nearly 40 years ago, frequenting a sex club maintained by the mob and pursuing a threesome with a porn star and a young girl. The authors have failed to find the two women or a possible black-and-white tape.\n\nBeyond that, the building in question has since been demolished and the mob kingpin behind the club was purportedly whacked in 1986. The sole eyewitness is named John Tino, and his rap sheet includes convictions for larceny, fraud and forgery.\n\nYet Trump\u2019s forays into construction and casinos, his nexus to organized crime and his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein together confer a patina of plausibility on a tale that would otherwise be close to nonexistent. The authors stand by Tino.\n\nThe book also raises the possibility Trump may have left in his wake more than a few terminated pregnancies. David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer prize winner and a Trump biographer, is quoted as saying that several \u201cname-brand\u201d women had pregnancies and abortions courtesy of Trump. Johnston adds: \u201cI don\u2019t have the medical records to prove it, but they\u2019ve told girlfriends about it.\u201d No names are listed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Summer Zervos leaves New York state appellate court in 2018. Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP\n\nAll the President\u2019s Women also examines evangelical support for Trump and Trump\u2019s religious life. One source is quoted as saying evangelical backing stems from Trump\u2019s judicial selections. Another attributes it to the loss of \u201cProtestant privilege in America\u201d.\n\nOn that score, Pew Research recently announced: \u201cIn US, Decline of Christianity Continues at Rapid Pace\u201d. Just over two in five Americans are Protestants and evangelical Protestantism is now the dominant branch. At the same time, the religiously unaffiliated comprise more than a quarter of the country.\n\nTrump the predator Read more\n\nPotentially more telling is that Paula White, a preacher of the prosperity gospel, has emerged as Trump\u2019s personal pastor. White\u2019s take on immigration and Scripture: Jesus \u201cdid live in Egypt for three and a half years. But it was not illegal. If He had broken the law then He would have been sinful and He would not have been our Messiah.\u201d Good to know.\n\nWhite is a resident of Trump Park Avenue, a condominium in Manhattan\u2019s Lenox Hill neighborhood. In 2018, Omarosa Manigault Newman, formerly of The Apprentice and the White House, asked if White\u2019s position as Trump\u2019s spiritual adviser \u201chad ever been missionary\u201d? Levine and El-Faizy don\u2019t go there. Instead, they look to White as a character witness.\n\nIt is unlikely All the President\u2019s Women will change many, if any, minds about Trump. He was never viewed by anyone as a boy scout. Each half of the US sees what it wants. If Trump is brought down, it won\u2019t be by his zipper.", "description": "Barry Levine, formerly of the National Enquirer, and Monique el-Faizy are well placed to write this alarming book", "authors": ["Lloyd Green"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee5b09d6bc40fc229cc45e0ecd3df8753e3a7406/65_281_2875_1725/master/2875.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=be2e1513ece13f9a4a21314aa8c67883", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
