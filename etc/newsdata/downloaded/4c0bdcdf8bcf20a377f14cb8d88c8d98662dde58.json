I've achieved most things that I've wanted to this year,\" he said in Shanghai.\n\n\"I'm happy with where everything is, and yeah, just want to finish the year off strongly because I feel the year that I've had deserves a finish like that.\"\n\nThe $10.25 million Shanghai event, with a winner's prize of $1.7 million, is the third and final leg of the PGA Tour's Asian swing, after the Zozo Championship and the CJ Cup in South Korea the week before.\n\nIn Japan, McIlroy led the field in par-five scoring, which should serve him well on the lengthy Sheshan course, widely considered one of the toughest on the Tour.\n\nAlso in the mix are a slew of past HSBC winners including Xander Schauffele, who beat current PGA Tour driving distance leader Tony Finau in an exciting play-off last year.\n\nRose, Watson, Garcia, Francesco Molinari and Mickelson also have tasted success in Shanghai.\n\nAnother to watch is 2016 winner Hideki Matsuyama, whose mojo is working after finishing second to Woods on home soil in Japan at the weekend, and third in Korea the week before.", "description": "World No 2 Rory McIlroy leads a field packed with Major winners into this week's WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9287/32c56d8530744d0da3ec11ba590698a8.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
