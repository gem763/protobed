It\u2019s also true the market can forgive and forget just as quickly. As much, when it comes to deeply oversold and out-of-favor growth stocks Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), it\u2019s time to put these names on your radar as stocks to buy today.\n\nWhile the averages have clawed their way back and into favor with index-focused investors, many risk assets have been left behind. Large-cap tech giants Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are two prolific performers and household names that have largely failed to participate in the market\u2019s current rally.\n\nSure, there\u2019s company-specific or macro reasons for the treason-like price behavior. There always is. More important, most often those concerns quietly and sometimes quickly disappear \u2014 and are then replaced by as easily defendable supports for making yesterday\u2019s whipping boy today\u2019s hottest new toy on Wall Street. So, NFLX and AMZN are stocks to buy?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m not here to defend NFLX or AMZN shares and their varied levels of investor loathing. I\u2019d rather focus on smaller, up-and-coming companies with big-time growth prospects and oversold price charts. These are stocks to buy if you can get past today\u2019s bearish narratives.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy: Pinterest (PINS)\n\nPinterest stock is the first of our growth stocks to buy. The wildly popular, web-based visual discovery platform rocketed higher by nearly 19% in early August after smoking earnings forecasts. The bullish price action set the stage for a market-leading, cup-with-handle breakout to fresh all-time-highs. But the classically strong-looking situation wasn\u2019t meant to be.\n\nWith nary a price driver to account for the complete unwinding of shares, Wall Street and its often fickle \u2014 and sometimes perverse \u2014 behavior took the technically-constructive pattern and sent shares into a well-oversold situation that\u2019s tested trend-line support this week.\n\nI recommend that Pinterest is a stock to buy today. Investors should size the position for a 10% stop-loss to minimize exposure and exit if nearby support fails.\n\n\n\n\n\nZscaler (ZS)\n\nZS stock is the second of our growth stocks to buy. The cybersecurity upstart dropped the ball with reduced guidance for its fiscal year amid worries that Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) is encroaching on its growth. Oh, the worries.\n\nI\u2019d be quick to point out it\u2019s far from unusual for one quarter\u2019s jeers to be replaced by investor cheer the very next reporting period. And ZS stock is no stranger to this phenomenon, either. Chalk up the reversal in price action to sandbagging, better-than-feared results or any number of reasons \u2014 Wall Street has lots of reasons to forgive and forget.\n\nOne early sign that investors will eventually reconnect with ZS stock is the price chart. Shares of Zscaler are oversold while filling a bullish earnings gap from two quarters ago. ZS stock is testing its lifetime cycle 62% Fibonacci support level.\n\nMy recommendation for this stock to buy is to purchase shares if a confirmed weekly chart bottoming candlestick pattern emerges in the next several sessions while continuing to hold ZS stock\u2019s fallout low of $46.04.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD)", "description": "When Wall Street gets in a mood, it's time to watch out.
