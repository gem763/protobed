I hate that papers say I snubbed Molly-Mae from my launch party when I didn\u2019t snub her from my launch party, I invited her and she didn\u2019t come. So let\u2019s make that very clear.\"\n\n(Image: Brett Cove/SOPA Images/REX)\n\n(Image: Brett D.

Why did I snub Molly-Mae? Why isn\u2019t it that she didn\u2019t come?\n\n\"It\u2019s only ever me [that is] the bad one.\"\n\nAnna was out on Tuesday to celebrate the launch of her In The Style collaboration with co-stars Amy Hart, Francesca Allen, Yewande Biala and Joanna Chimonides.\n\n(Image: Brett D.
