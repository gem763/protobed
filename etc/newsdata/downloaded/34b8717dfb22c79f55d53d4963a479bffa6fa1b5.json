As soon as I'd seen what they'd done I broke down in tears. I was horrified.\n\n\"It wasn't just my house, they did the neighbour's car too. The younger kids kept asking 'what does it mean, mummy?'. I had to try to say it was a spelling mistake and it didn't mean anything.\n\n\"I even went to the kids' school to explain what had happened in case one of them said the word to their friends. It was very embarrassing.\n\n\"Since it happened I can't sleep, I just keep thinking 'I need to keep my family safe'. My stress levels have gone through the roof. I already suffer from anxiety and this has made it worse.\"\n\nThe family believe a child may be behind the attack.\n\nShe added: \"I called my 15-year-old son down to look after the kids while I tried to wash it off but it wasn't shifting. As soon as he saw it, he tried to wash it off too.\n\n\"The number five bus goes straight past our house every 20 minutes so loads of people would have seen it. If they don't know you personally, they could think it's true.\n\n\"All my neighbours came round. There were a few jokey comments but that was all. Everyone was genuinely concerned. The PCSO said they would step up patrols but I've not seen anyone. I've got six children in the house and it's made me feel nervous.\n\n\"The younger ones don't understand but Zak's friends knocked on for him and he was so embarrassed and he went bright red.\"\n\nShe added: \"They didn't even spell it right which makes you think it could be a kid.\"\n\nStaffordshire Police are appealing for witnesses following the vandal attack.\n\nA spokesman said: \"We were called to a report of criminal damage at an address on Whitehouse Road. Graffiti has been sprayed on a property and car.\"", "description": "A car parked outside Kira Marriot's Stoke-on-Trent house had the word 'nonce' painted on it during the mystery attack", "authors": ["Hayley Parker", "Sam Elliott"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20704961.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Kira-Marriott.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
