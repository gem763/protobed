She was flanked by the tots on the boat\n\nSharing a throwback snap of them on holiday, the presenter admitted that she didn't understand how other parents had managed to get a snap of their children in their uniform because she had such a 'chaotic' morning.\n\nHelen penned: 'Emotional wreck. How the hell is everyone getting cute first day photos, we were wrestling trousers, dodging scooters, trying not to cry, engaging with new parents.... first morning at school was chaos.\n\n'Four and half years of doing what we want, when we want ends today.

On this occasion, however, it appeared that the activity had led to someone trying to hack her account.\n\n\u2018The one consolation was that the bank was so nice about it,\u2019 Helen recalls. \u2018I remember the guy told me not to feel stupid, it was happening all the time and this particular scam was even foxing their best security people.\u2019\n\nThat consolation was short-lived: over ensuing days, as thousands disappeared from Helen\u2019s bank account, it became clear that the apparently empathetic chat had all been part of the scam. The phone call had not come from her bank, but from the person defrauding her.\n\nWhat a hunk!
