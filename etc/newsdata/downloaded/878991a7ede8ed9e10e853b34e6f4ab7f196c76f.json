The 33-year-old was fired last October from his position at a Wells Fargo branch and hasn\u2019t been able to find another job in banking.\n\nIt was a few bank accounts opened years ago that got Gerard Camerino fired from Wells Fargo WFC 0.55% & Co. last October. He didn\u2019t even remember some of the customers in question, but the company suspected their accounts were among the millions of potentially fake ones that have dogged the firm for years.\n\nA former private banker in a San Francisco-area Wells Fargo branch, Mr. Camerino denies opening fake accounts. He has since applied for more than two dozen industry jobs and been rejected from them all. He wrote a letter to Wells Fargo retail-bank head Mary Mack asking for help but she sent him to the human resources department, which told him nothing could be done. After spending most of his career in banking, the 33-year-old isn\u2019t sure what to do next. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty devastating,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Camerino is one of thousands of low-level branch employees fired by Wells Fargo as part of the bank\u2019s effort to get its fake-account problem under control. Those firings began years before a 2016 settlement brought the problems into public view, and they continue quietly today.\n\nFiring employees suspected of dishonesty is standard practice at banks, where success depends on customers trusting a firm enough to leave their money there. But in the case of Wells Fargo, regulators, lawmakers and even the bank\u2019s own board have questioned whether the junior staffers were really the ones to blame. Pervasive pressure from managers to meet aggressive sales goals was the root cause of the problem, according to a report from the board.\n\nThat has been little consolation for low-level employees caught up in the scandal. Many have found they are now effectively blacklisted from the banking industry.\n\nA bank spokeswoman said Wells Fargo has \u201cmade fundamental changes to address the issues that may have contributed to undue sales pressure, while also holding team members at all levels accountable.\u201d Executives believe they must fire anyone suspected of opening fake accounts to meet the terms of insurance coverage that protects the bank from fraud-related losses, according to the board report.\n\nBut many fired employees say the investigations are stacked against them. The Wall Street Journal spoke to nearly two dozen former retail-bank staffers, including many who were fired. Wells Fargo declined to comment specifically on the ex-employees named in this story, but a spokeswoman said that \u201ca thorough process was followed and the terminations were warranted based on the actions of the individuals.\u201d\n\nMr. Camerino, at home with his family.

BAC 1.69% and did a stint as a professional online-poker player before joining Wells Fargo in 2008. Before 2016, bankers were expected to push customers as hard as possible to open accounts, he said.\n\nA job at a Wells Fargo branch could offer a career with good benefits and relative job security. It was particularly appealing for people without a college degree, who make up a considerable portion of the staff.\n\nMr. Camerino was surprised when, in 2018, he was called into a meeting with internal investigators and a bank attorney. They peppered him with questions about a handful of customers who had opened accounts early in his tenure. He told them he had no recollection of some of the customers but had never opened fake accounts.\n\nMr. Camerino was registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, and Wells Fargo wrote on his public Finra record that he was fired over \u201cquality of sales and short-term funding of bank accounts,\u201d boilerplate language used in many terminations. Mr. Camerino contacted lawyers to help him dispute the remarks but balked at the cost, which ran to $25,000 or more.\n\nRegulators disclosed in the 2016 settlement that the bank had fired 5,300 employees since 2011 for \u201cengaging in improper sales practices.\u201d The bank has since continued to fire junior employees including Mr. Camerino for similar reasons, though it isn\u2019t clear how many.\n\nSenior employees have also been taken down by the scandal. The bank\u2019s two most recent chief executives resigned after they were unable to get the firm\u2019s problems under control.\n\nSome managers in Wells Fargo\u2019s retail bank were fired for cause. Others were laid off in recent reorganizations and have found themselves unable to access their restricted-stock awards, a byproduct of sanctions that require regulatory approval of the payouts. The bank has been slow to submit the pay packages to a key regulator, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nBefore Mr. Camerino was fired, bank officials questioned him about several accounts opened early in his tenure.

Some former employees found work at other banks, though many said they were able to do so onlyby glossing over the terms of their departure from Wells Fargo. If another bank contacts Wells Fargo about a fired employee, the bank\u2019s policy is to disclose only job title and dates of employment.\n\nThat isn\u2019t an option for about 600 of the initial 5,300 fired employees, who were Finra-registered at some point. The reasons for their terminations are listed on their public records, though not all mention fake accounts. Contesting the black mark usually involves hiring a lawyer and spending more than a year in arbitration.\n\nOther banks worry about bringing over Wells Fargo\u2019s sales culture. Nicole Rikli started as a teller in late 2013 at a Phoenix-area Wells Fargo branch, where colleagues would visit a nearby retirement community to pitch accounts to elderly residents, she said. (The bank said it no longer does that.)\n\nMs. Rikli earned sales bonuses but said she never opened fake accounts. The bank terminated her in July 2016, telling her that some of the checking accounts she opened were unused or quickly closed, she said.\n\nShe quickly landed a similar job at JPMorgan Chase JPM 1.97% & Co. She said she told JPMorgan she had been fired and why. But within weeks, JPMorgan came across her Finra record and fired her, citing her earlier termination from Wells Fargo.\n\nShe took a lower-paying job in the startup sector and built a career in that industry, which she says she prefers to banking. About two years ago, Wells Fargo sent her an email survey about sales practices. \u201cI totally let them have it,\u201d Ms. Rikli said. \u201cBut I never heard anything back.\u201d\n\nThe bank branch in Fairfield, Calif., where Mr. Camerino worked.

Higher-ups pushed him to open accounts for relatives and stay late to cold-call customers, he said. They also directed him to open some fake accounts, he said.\n\nMr. Bello was fired in March 2016 over the fake accounts. \u201cIt was like something was pulled from under you,\u201d he said. He has tapped his 401(k) during stretches without steady work and has since left the industry, working two jobs to cover his student loans.\n\nAva Swendseid spent several years at Wells Fargo in Ventura County, Calif., where her branch manager would visit her desk hourly to ask about sales. After the 2016 settlement, she said, managers instead fixated on employees following scripts with phrases like \u201cdoing things right the first time.\u201d\n\nThe bank fired her in 2018, after grilling her about signatures on a child\u2019s bank account opened years earlier. She said she never opened accounts without consent and was unaware of any issues with that specific account.\n\nSince leaving the bank, Ms. Swendseid earned her M.B.A. online and is now working on a Ph.D. online. She relies on her firefighter husband\u2019s income.\n\nMs. Swendseid, who is studying workplace motivation, said she thinks about her experience at Wells Fargo every time she writes a paper.\n\nWells Fargo fired 5,300 employees for \u2018improper sales practices\u2019 starting in 2011 and has continued to fire junior employees, including Mr. Camerino.
