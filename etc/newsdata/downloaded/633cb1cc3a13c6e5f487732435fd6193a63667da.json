He was compelled to appear by a lawful congressional subpoena,\" Schiff told reporters. \"Witnesses like Dr. Kupperman need to do their duty and show up.\"\n\n\"A private citizen cannot sue the Congress to try to avoid coming in when they're served with a lawful subpoena. And we expect that the court will make short shrift of that argument. But nonetheless we move forward.\"\n\nSchiff, joined by the Democratic chairs of the House Oversight and Reform and House Foreign Affairs committees, had threatened in a letter Saturday that if Kupperman did not appear on Monday, they might hold him in contempt.\n\nOn Monday, the Intelligence chairman stopped short of saying Democrats would take that step, but left it on the table as a possible recourse.\n\n\u201cDr. Kupperman had testimony we believe would corroborate the allegations of misconduct that other witnesses have made,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cBut we move forward, and we will obviously consider \u2014 as we inform Dr. Kupperman's counsel \u2014 his failure to appear as evidence that may warrant the contempt proceeding against him.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has reported that Kupperman was on the July 25 phone call between President Trump Donald John Trump'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Kayla Mueller's mother: Daughter might still be alive 'If Obama had been as decisive' as Trump MORE and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump pressed Zelensky to launch an anti-corruption investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden: Trump 'an idiot' for saying Russian interference a 'hoax' Biden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike MORE, a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n\nA government whistleblower has charged that Trump also threatened to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid to Ukraine if Zelensky failed to comply.
