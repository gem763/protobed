After all, Trump tweeted on Friday that he had had a \u201cperfectly fine and respectful conversation\u201d and that \u201cthere was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!\u201d Further, he accused the whistleblower of being \u201chighly partisan.\u201d\n\nSo why not share all the information available with the House Intelligence Committee? If Trump\u2019s accuser is some kind of \u201cpartisan,\u201d why wouldn\u2019t the president want the world \u2014 or at least Congress \u2014 to know his basis for saying so?\n\nInstead, the White House and Justice Department are stonewalling, thus ripping apart systems of accountability that were put in place to prevent the abuse of the substantial powers we have given our intelligence services. This is part of a larger undertaking by Trump and his minions to block Congress from receiving information or hearing from witnesses, which is part of Congress\u2019s normal and constitutionally sanctioned work of keeping an eye on the executive branch.\n\nWhen Republicans held Congress during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, it seemed that a missing box of staples might have been enough to launch 100 subpoenas and months of hearings. Now, the GOP is going along with a president whose lawyers \u2014 in a court filing trying to block the Manhattan district attorney from getting Trump\u2019s tax returns \u2014 are asserting that \u201ca sitting President of the United States is not \u2018subject to the criminal process\u2019 while he is in office.\u201d It is a sweeping and astonishing assertion that a president is above the law as long as he sits in the White House, no matter which level of government might be investigating him.\n\nThere\u2019s also this: On Sunday, without admitting that he tried to encourage Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, Trump acknowledged discussing the former vice president and his son Hunter during a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the context of \u201cthe corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d It was classic Trump. Admit to a small piece of a dangerous story floating around about him, and then turn it into a smear of his opposition.\n\nWe have become so accustomed to what is blandly called \u201cpolitical polarization\u201d that we don\u2019t think there is any mystery about why the Republicans rally around Trump no matter what he does or what dangers our republic might face. It\u2019s just what they do now.\n\nAnd so far, this extreme partisanship has worked for Trump and his party. Attorney General William P. Barr\u2019s false account of what special counsel Robert S. Mueller III concluded in his probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election poisoned the public debate because it sat there for weeks before the report itself was released.\n\nThe lie that Mueller had cleared Trump took hold just enough that it turned the discussion of \u201cpartisanship\u201d on its head. If Democrats pursued impeachment, the Trumpists argued, they would be the partisans. Fear that this ploy would work has made Democrats in swing districts wary of impeachment.\n\nThus did Trump pick up an additional benefit from Barr\u2019s initial falsehood, backed up by his own party: While Democrats are united in condemning Trump\u2019s behavior, they have been divided on the impeachment question. A split opposition is exactly what Trump wants and needs \u2014 although there were signs Sunday that the latest story may be the last straw for many of the more cautious Democrats. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that while he had been \u201cvery reluctant to go down the path of impeachment,\u201d the latest allegations could make it \u201cthe only remedy that is coequal to the evil\u201d involved.\n\nStill, the lesson to Trump so far: If lying and stonewalling work, and your own party is too afraid to challenge you, stick with the program.\n\nYou might think that Republicans who have made national security their calling card since the Reagan era might finally hit the limits of their cravenness in the face of a whistleblower\u2019s bravery. But the party, our politics and our media system are too broken for the old norms to apply.\n\nEven Republican politicians who know how dangerous this situation is thus prefer to stay in their bunkers and hope to survive. The GOP\u2019s electorate is dominated by Trump\u2019s supporters. Staying mum provides protection from opponents inside their own party \u2014 and from their own voters. And if they broke ranks, Trump\u2019s media allies would attack them viciously.\n\nBy playing for time, these taciturn Republicans will be able to tell us once Trump is gone how they knew all along just how bad he was.\n\nBut when the greatest threat to our country is the corruption of our constitutional system, might at least some of the GOP\u2019s leading politicians decide that there are worse things than losing a primary, or being upbraided by Fox News?\n\nRead more from E.J.
