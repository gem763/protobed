I don\u2019t know about a deal in the Ukraine. I would not do a deal in the Ukraine now, obviously,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no proof that I did it, because I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer refused to discuss the details of his business dealings.\n\nHe also refused to answer questions about whether he helped his allies try to forge gas sales contracts with Naftogaz.\n\nMs Baumgardner has denied she has any business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nShe also refused to say whether replacing the US ambassador was discussed at the pitch meeting.\n\nEventually the group\u2019s plans were derailed after Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine\u2019s president, lost his re-election bid.\n\nRick Perry, the US Energy Secretary, travelled to Kyiv in May, for Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s inauguration.\n\nHe pressed the new president to fire members of Naftogaz\u2019s advisory board.\n\nAt one meeting, he made clear that the White House wanted the entire supervisory board replaced.\n\nThe board is supposed to be selected by the Ukrainian president\u2019s cabinet, in consultation with organisations including the EU and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nSome officials thought Mr Perry\u2019s request was undermining the official process.\n\nOne source, speaking to the Associated Press, said he was surprised by the meeting as he had always thought of the US government \u201cas having a higher ethical standard.\u201d\u200b\n\n\u201cWhat [Mr Perry] did not do is advocate for the business interests of any one individual or company,\u201d a US Energy Department spokesperson said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThat is fiction being pushed by those who are disingenuously seeking to advance a nefarious narrative that does not exist.\u201d\n\nMr Favroov declined to comment on the story. Harry Sargeant III did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA lawyer for Mr Parnas and Mr Fruman said Naftogaz executives had approached his clients about a deal, instead of the other way around.\n\n\u201cThe people from the company solicited my clients because Igor is in the gas business, and they asked them, and they flew to Washington and they solicited,\u201d said John Dowd.\n\n\u201cThey sat down and talked about it. And then it was presented to Secretary Perry to see if they could get it together.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a shakedown; it was an attempt to do legitimate business that didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear if Mr Perry\u2019s efforts to replace Naftogaz\u2019s board were linked to the businessmen\u2019s efforts in pushing for a change in CEO.\n\nThere are no allegations of criminal activity and it is unclear what role Mr Giuliani had in trying to secure a deal.\n\nDemocrats are closely scrutinising the White House\u2019s links to Ukraine, after the president called on the country to investigate Joe Biden, the Democratic 2020 frontrunner.\n\nThe latest allegations will increase fears about the Trump administration\u2019s behaviour regarding the country.\n\nOn Thursday the Wall Street Journal reported that the president ordered the removal of Ms Yovanovitch from her post following complaints from Rudy Giuliani and allies outside the Trump administration.\n\nMs Yovanovitch was accused by the president\u2019s lawyer, with no evidence, of trying to block efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.\n\nThe former ambassador will testify before congress on 11 October.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "A group of wealthy Republican Party donors reportedly tried to install a new CEO at Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0state gas company, while touting their connections to the Trump administration and Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal\u00a0lawyer. The businessmen hoped to personally\u00a0profit from a change of management, by striking a deal with the company.", "authors": ["Zamira Rahim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/07/08/rudy-giuliani-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
