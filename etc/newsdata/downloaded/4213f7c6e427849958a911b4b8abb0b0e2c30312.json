There are other non-climatic factors that also determine how severely a city or country will be impacted by climate change. Niall Smith, who analyzes regions\u2019 climate change vulnerability for the global risk consulting firm Maplecroft, tells TIME that it\u2019s also necessary to weigh in what\u2019s happening politically and socially in a region to figure out if the country can prepare.\n\n\u201cThe places with the least level of economic development are certainly in line to feel the impacts with the greatest degree, partially just due to their geographic fate \u2014 or their location \u2014 but more so based on the socio-economic and governance factors,\u201d says Smith.\n\nMany developing countries are also uniquely vulnerable, says Kelly Levin of the World Resources Institute, \u201ctheir livelihoods are dependent on natural resources. And if those natural resources are affected by climate change, their ability to feed their families and make a living is significantly impacted.\u201d\n\nTo get a sense of the challenges different regions are facing, TIME spoke to experts about six countries and cities will be be particularly affected by climate change.\n\nLagos, Nigeria\n\nA girl carries smoked fish at Makoko shanty town in Lagos on Aug. 30, 2012. PIUS UTOMI EKPEI\u2014AFP/Getty Images\n\nLagos is at \u201cextreme\u201d risk on Maplecroft\u2019s Climate Change Vulnerability Index. This is especially concerning because its population is expanding rapidly, and it is considered to be a major economic engine for the region.\n\nThe governor boasted that Lagos had reached a GDP of $136 billion in 2017, which is about a third of the entire country\u2019s GDP. The city is also a major transportation hub, with multiple ports and a major international airport and is a regional hub for high tech industry. Lagos has \u201ctransformed\u201d over the last 18 years, Lamido Sanusi, a former central bank governor, told the Financial Times last year. \u201cIn terms of roads, in terms of infrastructure, in terms of a general investment environment, in terms of security, the government has given people a greater opportunity to thrive.\u201d\n\nLagos is also at a disadvantage because it\u2019s considered to be one of the fastest growing cities in the world, which will put a \u201cstrain on infrastructure and resources,\u201d according to Smith. Its population is projected to nearly double over the next 15 years, growing from its current population of 13,463,420 to 23,418,770.\n\nIn the future, Smith warns that Lagos residents will also experience more hot days and droughts.\n\nClimate change could threaten the city\u2019s economy. The city is especially vulnerable because it\u2019s located on the Gulf of Guinea, says Levin. As sea levels rise, it\u2019s likely to affect cause coastal erosion and contaminate potable water. This could harm local agriculture in the countryside and damage the country\u2019s fishing industry, which could be dire in a country with \u201ctremendous\u201d poverty, Levin says.\n\n\u201cYou could see more and more people moving in from the countryside because of loss of economic opportunity into a city like Lagos, which could make the whole situation more challenging,\u201d Levin says.\n\nIf Lagos struggles, it could seriously reduce economic opportunity in the region.\n\nHaiti\n\nA man walks in street that was flooded in Malfeti, in the city of Fort Liberte, in the city of Fort Liverte, in the north east of Haiti, on Sept. 8, 2017, during the passage of Hurricane Irma. AFP Contributor\u2014AFP/Getty Images\n\nClimate change can be a \u201cthreat multiplier,\u201d says Christina Chan, the director of the World Resources Institute\u2019s climate resilience practice. This is especially true for Haiti. The island nation is located in the \u201cAtlantic Hurricane Basin,\u201d which means that it is vulnerable to hurricanes. In comparison to other projections on climate change, scientists are less certain about the link between climate change and hurricane frequency and intensity, but studies have suggested that hurricanes are likely getting wetter and more intense due to climate change.\n\nSince Haiti is a very poor country, recovering from natural disasters and preparing for future storms is especially challenging. The devastation in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and 2016\u2019s Hurricane Matthew was compounded by the country\u2019s lack of disaster preparedness. The disasters were major setbacks for the country\u2019s economic development; the $8 billion price tag of recovering from the earthquake surpassed the country\u2019s GDP, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nThe landscape is also heavily deforested and mountainous, which means it will be more susceptible to landslides.\n\nAccording to Levin, Haiti will also struggle because the population is dependent on agriculture, and rising sea levels mean that salt water may contaminate freshwater. The United Nations warns that rising sea levels may cause saltwater to permeate farmland and freshwater supplies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly a large portion of Haitians that are dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods and income. And if you have overall patterns of rainfall declines as temperatures rise, certainly that would impact farmers,\u201d Levin says.\n\nYemen\n\nMoaz Ali Mohammed, a two-year-old Yemeni boy from an impoverished family in the Bani Amer region, who suffers from acute malnutrition and weighing eight kilograms, sits on his mother's lap at their house in the Aslam district in the northern Hajjah province on July 28, 2019. ESSA AHMED\u2014AFP/Getty Images\n\nCountries with weak institutions and governments are likely to find it especially difficult to adapt to climate change, says Smith. Since civil war broke out in Yemen in 2015, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed directly as a result of the conflict, but also due to the subsequent famine, poor sanitation and a lack of clean water, according to the United Nations. About 1.6 million children in Yemen are living with malnutrition in 2019, according to the UN.\n\nBoth war and climate change will make water shortages and famine more likely. According to a Untied Nations report, most contemporary famines result from armed conflict and are worsened by natural disasters.\n\nAs the report explains, \u201cParties to the conflict may use food as a weapon, cutting off food supplies, destroying systems of food production and distribution, and stealing food aid. Agricultural production falls, which both limits the availability of food and cuts off many rural houses from their livelihoods. And with higher levels of poverty, many families cannot afford the food they need, especially at inflated prices.\u201d\n\nMalaria is also becoming more common in Yemen, and may be exacerbated by rising temperatures. As Yemen has a long coast, it\u2019s also vulnerable to rising sea levels, according to Levin.\n\nAn area to watch, says Levin, \u201cWhenever you\u2019re thinking about a country in that region\u2026 [is] the issue of rising temperatures impacting water scarcity, especially when it\u2019s exacerbated by water management challenges and expanding population.\u201d\n\nAs other countries work to curb their oil consumption, it may be a mixed blessing for Yemen, according to Levin. While lower emissions are believed to be necessary to limit climate change, it could also reduce demands for one of Yemen\u2019s major imports \u2014 oil \u2014 which could impact Yemen\u2019s economy, Levin says.\n\nManila\n\nFlood victims are evacuated in a rescue boat after their homes were swamped by heavy flooding in Quezon city, suburban Manila, Philippines, Sept. 19, 2014. NurPhoto\u2014Corbis via Getty Images\n\nThe Philippines faces a high risk of natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, and especially hurricanes. Manila, which is located along the coast, is also densely populated, which makes it more difficult to evacuate, requires more social services and makes it more challenging to rebuild after a disaster. Poor infrastructure, including ineffective drainage and sanitation systems, has been blamed for the toll of floods in the city, including a 2009 flood that submerged 80% of the city.\n\nHowever, Chan says that the Philippines is in fact on the \u201cforefront of adaptation\u201d to climate change, and have designated part of their budget to making their country\u2019s agricultural sector and infrastructure more resilient, and preparing to respond to future disasters. For instance, the government launched a Flood Management Master Plan for Metro Manila in 2012, which aims to manage future floods by modernizing and building new pumping stations and investing in other infrastructure along waterways, according to the Asian Infrastructure investment Bank.\n\nThe Philippines have created a Climate Change Commission, which implements programs such as the National Climate Change Action Plan, a long-term strategy for prioritizing \u201cfood security, water sufficiency, ecosystem and environmental stability, human security, climate smart industries and services, sustainable energy, knowledge and capacity development.\u201d\n\nKiribati\n\nDamaged roads due to the flooding in Kirbati - Tarawa's single paved road has collapsed because of the flooding from the sea. The people of Kiribati are under pressure to relocate due to sea level rise. Each year, the sea level rises by about half an inch. Though this may not sound like much, it is a big deal considering the islands are only a few feet above sea level, which puts them at risk of flooding and sea swells. Jonas Gratzer\u2014LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nRising sea levels mean that Kiribati may be wiped off the map entirely in the coming decades. The islands have even purchased 5,000 acres of land in Fiji in case they need to relocate.\n\nWhile Kitribati, like many other countries, is taking steps to prepare for climate change, the Pacific island nation must also reckon with the fact that \u201cfor their island, adaptation will have its limits,\u201d says Chan. The islands are only six feet above sea level and sit upon a system of atolls and reef islands, which means that rising sea levels are a threat to the nation\u2019s existence.\n\nThis vulnerability has also spurred Kiribati to take serious steps in climate mitigation. Kiribati has allied itself with other vulnerable island countries to advocate for action to fight climate change, and taken other measures such as planting mangrove trees and building sea walls.\n\nMeanwhile, Levin says, rising sea levels are likely to contaminate the island\u2019s freshwater and harm its soil, which is not especially fertile for agriculture to begin with. The island\u2019s vital fishing industry is also more vulnerable, as climate changes leads to shifts in the ocean, including coral bleaching; damage to the structure of reefs; marine \u201cheat waves\u201d; and other conditions that force marine life to move north.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nEmployees walk past solar panels at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum Solar Park on March 20, 2017, in Dubai. STRINGER\u2014AFP/Getty Images\n\nLike many of the other places on this list, the United Arab Emirates is facing many risks due to its location. Like Yemen and other neighboring states, the UAE is facing an \u201cextreme risk\u201d of water stress, according to Smith, and will need to spend a lot more energy on cooling.\n\nUnlike many other countries facing these threats, however, the UAE is wealthier and is able to make sophisticated investments to blunt the impact of climate change. For instance, the UAE is working to produce its own fresh water, build temperature-controlled spaces, investments in green energy, and developing crops that can withstand hotter temperatures.\n\nHowever, according to Levin, it remains to be seen whether these adaptations will reach Yemen\u2019s entire population, because the country faces rampant inequality.\n\n\u201cThe question is, will adequate investments be made in time, and will the poorest be able to enjoy the same kind of comforts as the rest of the population,\u201d Levin says. \u201cYou can look at the face of a GDP of a given country. But that really masks tremendous inequality. It\u2019s hard to necessarily say that one country\u2019s in such a better position to withstand climate impacts.\u201d\n\nWrite to Tara Law at tara.law@time.com.", "description": "Climate change is expected to affect every country in the world, but its impact will not be felt equally across all regions.
