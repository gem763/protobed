The two companies did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for the latest numbers, but in July, Nokia said it had 45 commercial 5G deals, while Ericsson's latest published number was 24.\n\nHuawei is keen to show that it can still score deals with major mobile carriers \u2014 despite being effectively blocked from the rollout of 5G in big markets like Japan and Australia. In the meantime, President Donald Trump's administration has reportedly been pushing allies to keep Huawei out of their 5G rollout plans.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. and Poland signed an agreement to create stricter guidelines for companies wishing to be part of the latter's 5G plans.\n\nThe two sides agreed to look into whether a supplier is subject to control by a foreign government.
