The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February.\u201d \u2014 Mark Twain\n\nThe stock market has fallen sharply this week due to fears of a global recession, the never-ending trade war with China and new calls for impeaching the President.\n\nIs it time to sell? The above quotes, taken from my book, \u201cThe Maxims of Wall Street,\u201d reflect the mood of investors these days.\n\nBut you would be wise not to panic. Interest rates, inflation and unemployment rates are near all-time lows. The market could turn on a dime if China signs a trade deal or the Fed stimulates the money markets.\n\nHere are some appropriate quotes to suggest a calmer approach\n\n\u201cEveryone is a disciplined, long-term investor until the market goes down.\u201d \u2014 Steve Forbes\n\n\u201cOwners of sound securities should never panic. Businessmen can profit handsomely if they will disregard the pessimistic auguries and self-appointed prophets of doom.\u201d \u2014 J. Paul Getty\n\nBeware of Doom-and-Gloomers\n\nAt the Philadelphia MoneyShow last week, I made my appearance as Ben Franklin (see photo below), who warned us more than 200 years ago to beware of doom and gloomers, who he referred to as \u201ccroakers.\u201d Back in his day, he noted that, \u201cI saw in the public papers frequent complaints of hard times, deadness of trade, and the scarcity of money.\u201d He paid them no attention and prospered.\n\nPhoto Credit: Paul Dykewicz\n\nDr. Franklin told the story of an elderly man with a wise look and very grave manner who stopped by his print shop. The visitor sought to warn Franklin that Philadelphia was a \u201csinking hole\u201d and that he should sell everything at once. For years, the old croaker refused to buy a house because \u201call was going to destruction.\u201d Franklin concluded the story by saying, \u201cAt last I had the pleasure of seeing him give five times as much for a house as he might have bought it for when he first began his croaking.\u201d\n\nFranklin was a natural optimist. One year, while ambassador to France, he wrote a friend, \u201cWe had a terrible winter in France\u2026 Yet I was still alive, the sun started to return, the days to lengthen, the spring to come, the trees and gardens to regain their vendure, all nature to laugh, and to me, happiness.\u201d\n\nWho are the croakers today? The permabears and gold bugs on Wall Street who are constantly warning us of a stock market crash and the global warming alarmists who are predicting the imminent collapse of our ecosystem and Florida going underwater.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see them buy ocean-front properties with all their book royalties and speaking fees! (Wait a minute! Former President Barack Obama and his wife just purchased a $15 million beach-front property in Martha\u2019s Vineyard in addition to their beachfront property in Kailua Bay, Hawaii.)\n\nBen Franklin Recommends My Newsletter and \u2018Maxims\u2019!\n\nIt turns out that Dr. Franklin is a big fan of my newsletter and the book \u201cMaxims of Wall Street.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that Dr. Franklin is quoted 17 times in the new 6th ed. of \u201cThe Maxims of Wall Street,\u201d such as:\n\n\u201cNothing but money is sweeter than honey.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are three friends in life \u2014 a faithful wife, an old dog, and ready money!\u201d\n\n\u201cNecessity never made a good bargain.\u201d\n\n\u201cBad news travels faster than good news.\u201d (So true in the stock market!)\n\n\u201cGenius without education is live silver in the mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn investment in knowledge pays the best interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cA fool and his money are soon parted.\u201d\n\nAnd for those who, like us, look for insider trading opportunities:\n\n\u201cThree can keep a secret \u2014 if two are dead!\u201d\n\nThere are over 800 great quotations and short stories in \u201cThe Maxims of Wall Street,\u201d all divided into categories, such as value vs. growth, contrary investing, brokers and advisers, financial privacy, gold & mining and income investing.\n\nWarren Buffett is a big fan: \u201cI love your book and plan to steal some of its lines.\u201d (He\u2019s quoted more than anyone else.)\n\nIt is the one and only compendium of financial adages, ancient proverbs and worldly wisdom \u2014 it has sold over 28,000 copies. Alex Green calls it a \u201cclassic.\u201d\n\nCommodity guru Dennis Gartman says, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing the depth of wisdom one can find in just one or two lines from your book.\u201d\n\nKevin O\u2019Leary Endorses My \u201cMaxims\u201d Book\n\nKevin O\u2019Leary of \u201cShark Tank\u201d fame is also a big fan of the Maxims. Looking at my book (see photo), he suggested adding this quote: \u201cGetting rich is easy if you follow three rules: spend less, save more, invest the rest.\u201d\n\nOrder Now at Super Discount!\n\nThe \u201cMaxims\u201d book is available for only $20 for the first copy, and all additional copies are $10 each. And if you order an entire box of 32 books, you pay only $300. As Hetty Green, America\u2019s first female millionaire, said, \u201cWhen I see a bargain, I buy a lot of it!\u201d Plus, I pay postage and autograph each copy. It is the perfect gift for investors, clients, money managers and stockbrokers.\n\nTo order, call Harold at Ensign Publishing at 1-866-254-2057, or go to www.skousenbooks.com.\n\nBy the way, here\u2019s something else I shared with attendees at the Philadelphia Money Show last week: The #1 investment in my personal IRA .
