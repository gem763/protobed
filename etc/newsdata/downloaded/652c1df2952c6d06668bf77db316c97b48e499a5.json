Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and Adam Schiff (D-CA) issued a joint statement Thursday evening accusing President Donald Trump of politicizing the Department of Justice (DOJ) through a criminal investigation into the origins of the Russia probe.\n\nNadler, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, and Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement via Twitter: \u201cIf the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage.\u201d\n\nIf the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage. Joint statement w/ @RepAdamSchiff \u2014 (((Rep. Nadler))) (@RepJerryNadler) October 25, 2019\n\nThe two Democrats were reacting to a report in the New York Times that the DOJ had \u201cshifted an administrative review of the Russia investigation closely overseen by Attorney General William P. Barr to a criminal inquiry.\u201d The inquiry has been conducted by U.S. Attorney John Durham.\n\nThere is no evidence that the inquiry is being used as \u201cpolitical retribution,\u201d though the Times took a similar line: \u201cThe opening of a criminal investigation is likely to raise alarms that Mr. Trump is using the Justice Department to go after his perceived enemies. \u2026 Mr. Trump has made clear that he sees the typically independent Justice Department as a tool to be wielded against his political enemies,\u201d it reported (original link).\n\nNeither Nadler nor Schiff addressed the substance of Durham\u2019s investigation.\n\nFor years, Schiff claimed that there was evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election, but an investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller turned up none.\n\nInstead, Schiff and fellow Democrats sought to block or discourage investigations into the origins of the Russia investigation \u2014 including possible political bias by law enforcement and intelligence officials, and alleged criminal leaks of the names of Americans who were caught up in surveillance of foreign communications.\n\nNadler and Schiff did not acknowledge that their own efforts to press forward with an unauthorized \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d might be seen as creating \u201ca political narrative for the next election,\u201d one that damages the rule of law.\n\nJoel B.
