It was seen churning out its first ever stars: supermassive objects that are only at the very beginning of their lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this little blue smudge, meaning it\u2019s a very small galaxy that contains a lot of super-hot, very massive young stars that formed recently,\u201d says Matthew Bayliss, a research scientist in MIT\u2019s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. \u201cThis galaxy is similar to the very first galaxies that formed in the universe \u2026 the kind of which no one has ever seen in X-ray in the distant universe before.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

As they do, the universe and its light is bent.\n\nThat can be used something like a magnifying glass, because of a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Using complex processing, scientists can examine the light and use it to see \"magnified\" images.\n\nResearchers have been able to use this before to study objects at optical wavelengths. But the new research is a breakthrough because they have never before usedit to examine the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is so difficult that some thought it might be impossible.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to see an X-ray source behind a cluster, it\u2019s like trying to see a candle next to a really bright light,\" said Bayliss. \u201cSo we knew this was a challenging measurement to make.\u201d\n\nTo get around that problem, researchers used Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory, one of the most powerful X-ray telescopes in the world. With that, they were able to start looking deeper and deeper into the universe \u2013 including at such infant galaxies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re catching this galaxy at a very useful stage, where it\u2019s got these really young stars,\u201d Bayliss says. \u201cEvery galaxy had to start out in this phase, but we don\u2019t see a lot of these kinds of galaxies in our own neighborhood. Now we can go back in time, look in the distant universe, find galaxies in this early phase of their life, and start to study how star formation is different there.\u201d", "description": "Astronomers have used a massive cluster of galaxies to \"peer back in time\", looking at events that took place nearly 10 billion years ago.
