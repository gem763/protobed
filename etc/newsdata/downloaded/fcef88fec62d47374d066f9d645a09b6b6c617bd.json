How on earth did it not leak sooner? Kavanaugh\u2019s allies would have had an intense interest in putting it out there in the immediate aftermath of his confirmation hearings, to help vindicate the new justice before he took his seat on the Court.\n\nAlso: Is there anyone close to Blasey Ford who thinks her motives were entirely pure in accusing Kavanaugh? Her own lawyer admitted earlier this year that \u201cpart of what motivated Christine\u201d to come forward was making sure people knew Kavanaugh was a foul character in case he ended up taking \u201ca scalpel to Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re never going to hear from Ralph Blasey on this, I assume, but I\u2019d pay money to watch that interview.\n\nWithin days of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, a fascinating encounter took place. Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s father was approached by Ford\u2019s father at the golf club where they are both members. Ralph Blasey, Ford\u2019s father, went out of his way to offer to Ed Kavanaugh his support of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, according to multiple people familiar with the conversation that took place at Burning Tree Club in Bethesda, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019m glad Brett was confirmed,\u201d Ralph Blasey told Ed Kavanaugh, shaking his hand. Blasey added that the ordeal had been tough for both families. The encounter immediately caused a stir at the close-knit private golf club as staff and members shared the news. The conversation between the two men echoed a letter that Blasey had previously sent to the elder Kavanaugh. Neither man returned requests for comment about the exchanges.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Kavanaugh\u2019s and Ford\u2019s fathers belong to the same golf club. WaPo reported that a year ago in a newly interesting piece about the fact that Blasey Ford had received vocal support from her husband\u2019s relatives in accusing Kavanaugh \u2014 but, curiously, not from her own blood relatives. When WaPo finally got her father on the phone, he was terse:\n\nReached by phone on Tuesday, Ford\u2019s father, Ralph Blasey Jr., offered a brief endorsement of his daughter. \u201cI think all of the Blasey family would support her. I think her record stands for itself. Her schooling, her jobs and so on,\u201d he said before hanging up. Moments later, after picking up the phone a second time, he added: \u201cI think any father would have love for his daughter.\u201d\n\nConspicuously missing is him saying, \u201cOf course I believe her.\u201d WaPo went on to note that the Blaseys are Republicans, but then so are some of Christine\u2019s in-laws and they had no difficulty vouching for her. It doesn\u2019t sound as though Blasey Ford is estranged from her mother and father either. Although her husband acknowledged that she \u201cdidn\u2019t always get along with her parents because of differing political views,\u201d the paper claimed that she maintains a \u201cmeaningful relationship with her family back east\u201d and brings her sons to Washington every summer.\n\nAssuming the story about her father congratulating Kavanaugh\u2019s father is true, what could possibly explain it except Ralph Blasey doubting Christine\u2019s allegations for whatever reason? Granted, two big cheeses at the local tony country club might normally be expected to keep the peace in a case of conflict, but most conflicts don\u2019t involve \u2026 your own daughter\u2019s attempted rape by your friend\u2019s Supreme-Court-nominee son. If Blasey felt awkward (to put it mildly) about coexisting with Kavanaugh in their social circles, he could have simply avoided him. \u201cI\u2019m glad Brett was confirmed\u201d is a terrible betrayal of his daughter unless he has reason to believe his daughter is lying and was trying to cure a terrible injustice.\n\nAgain, how did we not hear this sooner?\n\nUpdate: This was being whispered about during the Ford/Kavanaugh saga. Others heard of it but apparently not until now were multiple sources willing to confirm it.", "description": "Bombshell.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/f-2.jpg"}
