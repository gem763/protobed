The Skate Canada-Mount Forest club has 75 members and is nestled in the small community of Mount Forest, about 140 kilometres north west of Toronto.\n\nSydney West & Connor Romanowski from the Mount Forest Skating Club on Battle of the Blades Episode 4. (Insight Productions / Battle of the Blades)\n\nSydney and Connor are Grade 8 students in the same class who also play on the same soccer team. Skating together for Mini Blades seemed like a natural next step.\n\nSydney said, \"I think the show is a great way to get both hockey players and figure skaters together to create something that no one has seen before and I enjoy watching it and being a small part of it.\" For his part, Connor said, \"I thought it would be fun and it would be great to get back on the ice and try something new.\"\n\nBoth skaters are very active away from the rink. Sydney is a huge Ninja Warrior fan with a course in her backyard for practice. Connor has already earned his green-level black belt in Taekwondo.\n\nClub President Nicole West sees the benefit of being involved with Mini Blades this way: \"It's an amazing show and we would like our skaters to have this unique opportunity and encourage more collaboration between hockey and figure skating. We hope to inspire other people to skate who might be hesitant by doing something different to see what's possible.\"\n\nSydney West (12) & Connor Romanowski (13) and Coach Jack\n\nThe positive effect of the Mini Blades is also clear to Battle of the Blades judge and father of four children Colby Armstrong, who says, \"This is cool. It's important for kids to see that you don't need to be afraid to try new things.\"", "description": "\"I think the show is a great way to get both hockey players and figure skaters together to create something that no one has seen before...\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5317268.1570747689!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/sydney-west-12-connor-romanowski-13.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
