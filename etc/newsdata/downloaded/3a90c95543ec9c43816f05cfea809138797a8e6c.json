The president also thanked others for their assistance in the strike but emphasized that US agents were at the heart of the operation.\n\n\"This raid was impeccable and could only have taken place with the acknowledgment and help of certain other nations and people,\" Trump during a nationally televised press conference on Sunday morning. \"I want to thank the nations of Russia, Turkey, Syria, and Iraq, and I also want to thank the Syrian Kurds for certain support they were able to give us.\"\n\nNOW WATCH: We asked a law professor about the likelihood of a Trump impeachment", "description": "The agency worked with Iraqi and Kurdish intelligence officials to narrow down the leader's exact location and place local spies.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Pb_MVdCqZeVB.DBFK7oXtw--~B/aD02ODM7dz05MTE7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/c7528ffc58fe91aeb075856d7a286245", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
