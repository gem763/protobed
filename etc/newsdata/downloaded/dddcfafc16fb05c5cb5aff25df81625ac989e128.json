It's like a Ferrari 458, just $200,000 cheaper.\n\nRead more: Chevy's new Corvette is a radical break with the past \u2014 here's a closer look at the 8th generation of this icon\n\nConvertibles, while fun, are usually compromises for high-performance vehicles and tend to present significant technical challenges for mid-engine cars; European \"spiders\" have to fit the engine and the retracted hardtop into a very modest amount of space.\n\nSeamless stowing of the top \u2014 and trunk space!\n\n\"The team engineered the hardtop to stow seamlessly into the body, maintaining the Stingray's impressive ability to store two sets of golf clubs in the trunk even with the top down,\" Chevy said in a statement. \"The convertible also keeps the coupe's front storage compartment, which can fit an airline-spec carry-on and a laptop bag.\"\n\nTruck space and a drop-top! What more could an enthusiast want?\n\nThe two-piece top retracts in 16 seconds and can be dropped while driving as fast as 30 mph, Chevy said. It's powered by six electric motors and doesn't smother the engine when stowed.\n\n\"The sheet-molded composite top stows in a compartment made from lightweight composite panels and heat shields to manage heat from the engine,\" Chevy explained.\n\nThat engine makes 495 horsepower with 470 pound-feet of torque, and power is routed through another C8 Vette first: an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission.\n\nThe new Corvette goes on sale for the 2020 model year, and if the convertible isn't available at the same time, it should be soon after. Chevy isn't wasting any time getting its new Vette to customers.", "description": "The convertible version will be the first Vette with a retractable hardtop.
