Elizabeth Warren speaks during the Democratic presidential candidates debate in Westerville, Ohio, October 15, 2019. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) released a far-reaching plan on Monday outlining her education-policy proposals. Titled \u201cA Great Public School Education for Every Student,\u201d the plan calls for banning for-profit charter schools and using the IRS to investigate nonprofit charters that may \u201cactually serve for-profit interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to provide great neighborhood schools for every student,\u201d Warren\u2019s plan reads. \u201cWe should stop the diversion of public dollars from traditional public schools through vouchers or tuition tax credits \u2014 which are vouchers by another name. We should fight back against the privatization, corporatization, and profiteering in our nation\u2019s schools.\u201d\n\nWriting on Twitter after the plan\u2019s release, Warren said it \u201cmakes big, structural changes that would help give every student the resources that they need to thrive.\u201d\n\nWe must stop the privatization of public schools. My administration will end federal funding for the expansion of charter schools, ban for-profit charter schools, and ensure existing charter schools are held to the same level of transparency and accountability as public schools. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 21, 2019\n\nAs is the case with Warren\u2019s Medicare-for-All plan, her education platform mirrors that of Senator Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), who in May endorsed a ban on for-profit charter schools. Warren also joins Sanders in a pledge to end publicly funded voucher programs and increasing Title I funding for underprivileged schools, but goes further in calling for IRS investigations of nonprofit charters.\n\n\u201cMany so-called nonprofit schools \u2014 including charter schools \u2014 operate alongside closely held, for-profit service providers. Others are run by for-profit companies that siphon off profits from students and taxpayers. The IRS should investigate the nonprofit status of these schools and refer cases to the Tax Fraud Division of the Department of Justice when appropriate,\u201d the plan reads.\n\nThe plan is a stark departure from the Trump administration\u2019s advocacy for school choice. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has proposed, among other things, a $5 billion federal tax credit that would fund scholarships and education programs for private schools.", "description": "Senator Elizabeth Warren released a far-reaching plan on Monday outlining her education-policy proposals that call for banning for-profit charter schools.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
