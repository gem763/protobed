The Artemis Generation is now revealing its spacesuits for our generation.\u201d\n\nThe 1st woman and next man will go to the Moon in 2024 \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80 Today, we previewed the next-generation #Artemis spacesuits that our astronauts will wear \u2013 1 for launch and re-entry, and 1 for exploring the lunar South Pole.

Dustin Gohmert, project manager for Orion Crew Survival Systems, followed her into the spotlight, wearing a suit prototype designed for use during launch, re-entry and in-flight emergencies.\n\nThe suits are the result of years of research and redesign into suit usability. Not everyone was a fan of the red-white-and-blue color scheme, but the upgrades go far beyond the hues of the fabric: For example, the spacewalk suit has been reworked with high-tech materials to provide more flexibility in the shoulders, hips and knees. Astronauts wearing the xEMU suit will find it easy to lift their arms over their heads, a feat \u201cwhich they can\u2019t do today, and couldn\u2019t do during the Apollo program,\u201d NASA spacesuit engineer Amy Ross said.\n\nBridenstine said the Apollo moonwalkers had to travel across the lunar surface by means of bunny hops, due to the lack of mobility in the leg joints of their spacesuits. \u201cNow we\u2019re actually going to be able to walk on the surface of the moon, which is very different than our suits of the past,\u201d he said.\n\nTaking a page from Russia\u2019s spacesuit playbook, NASA has designed the xEMU suits to be entered through the rear. The upper torso has an improved, multi-microphone audio system that gets rid of the need for the uncomfortable \u201cSnoopy cap\u201d that became famous in the Apollo era. And the helmet has a quick-swap protective visor that should cut down on wear and tear.\n\nLIVE: Get a look at the spacesuits the 1st woman & next man will wear to explore the Moon in 2024! During this demo, check out the upgrades and view our 2 new suit prototypes \u2013 1 for launch and re-entry, and 1 for exploring the lunar South Pole.

(That first two-woman spacewalk, aimed at replacing a faulty battery unit on the International Space Station, is now set for Friday.)\n\nSize shouldn\u2019t matter so much with the xEMU suit, which has swappable components to accommodate virtually any astronaut. \u201cTo be clear, Kristine is wearing a spacesuit that will fit all of our astronauts when we go to the moon,\u201d Bridenstine said.\n\nThe launch-and-entry suit will remain predominantly orange because that color shows up best if the astronauts have to make an emergency exit at sea. But the helmet is lighter and stronger, and the suit has touchscreen-compatible gloves as well as a new and improved built-in cooling system.\n\nNASA still has to do further design refinements and testing to make sure the new spacesuits are good to go. The xEMU is due to get a tryout on the space station in the early 2020s, setting the stage for a star turn on the moon in 2024.", "description": "The fashion statement for NASA's future moonwalkers goes beyond basic white to add some flagworthy touches of red and blue.
