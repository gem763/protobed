It is a cruel and inhumane step that would leave unaccompanied children scattered around Europe, falling prey to smugglers and traffickers.\u201d\n\nLord Alf Dubs, who earlier this year passed an amendment to continue the family reunion provisions after Brexit, told this newspaper: \u201cGiven that both houses passed the legislation that we should go on having the child reunion mechanism after we\u2019ve left the EU, I think it is disgraceful if they now say they\u2019re going to drop it altogether.\n\n\u201cThese are vulnerable children. It\u2019s an absolute disgrace. It\u2019s shabby and contemptible. I am going to raise it in parliament as soon as I can.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It makes for international cooperation, but above all it saves young people from being absolutely without any family members at all.\n\n\u201cThe whole argument for the legislation is that if we give young people safe routes, then they don\u2019t fall into the hands of traffickers. All that will happen is that they will then resort to the traffickers. It\u2019s a lose-lose situation.\u201d\n\nA UNHCR spokesperson said: \u201cThe UNHCR understands that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the Dublin Regulation, which allows for the transfer of asylum-seeking children and adults within the EU to join family members, will no longer apply to the UK.\n\n\u201cUNHCR urges the UK government and its European partners to work together to ensure that appropriate arrangements remain in place for asylum seekers, refugees and stateless people.\u201d\n\nThe warnings come amid a surge in displaced people attempting to cross from France to Britain in small boats, which has prompted fierce debate around how to prevent asylum seekers from embarking on dangerous journeys.\n\nCharities have urged ministers to roll back \u201cbrutal\u201d border policies at Calais which they say push people into turning to illegal routes, while Boris Johnson warned that he would send any asylum seekers who successfully cross back to France.\n\nThe Home Office has been approached for comment.", "description": "Dozens more refugee children could risk their lives making the dangerous crossing from France to Britain if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, charities have warned.
