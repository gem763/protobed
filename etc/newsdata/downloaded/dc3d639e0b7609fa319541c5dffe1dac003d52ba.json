The head was buried in a communal garden next to the victim's block of flats and Masala used a soup spoon to dig the hole\n\nAfter using the full wine bottle to bludgeon Ms Planche to death in her own home in the city, Masala returned a week later with a saw to slice her head off.\n\nShe then buried the head in a communal garden next to Ms Planche's block of flats, after digging a hole using a soup spoon.\n\nThe rest of the body was chopped into parts, and then placed into five bags, wheeled away in a supermarket trolley and then dumped in the Canal du Midi.\n\nJudge David Senat, the President of the Court, expressed astonishment at the way petty arguments had escalated, saying: 'A disagreement about the filing of documents, about their office roles, about respect for their private lives - there are always jealousies in the professional context, but how does it lead to such a strong hatred?'\n\nThe trial of a woman accused of killing and dismembering one of her colleagues is set to run from October 21 to 26, 2019, in the court of appeal of Toulouse (pictured)\n\nWitnesses have claimed that Masala was talkative and disruptive in the office, while the partially sighted Ms Planche was a much-respected member of staff at the Association for the Management of Funds for the Integration of the Disabled.\n\nMasala has admitted that she had been exasperated at the way Ms Planche used to take work home with her, and went round to her flat in May 2016 'to complain'.\n\nPierre Dunac, Masala's defence barrier, said his client had panicked, and this is why she lashed out with the wine bottle.\n\nMs Planche was recovering from an eye operation at the time, and her corpse was left lying in her home before Masala returned with the saw seven days later.\n\nThe killing only came to light when one of the bags containing body parts was found in the canal by a passer-by on May 24, 2016.\n\nMasala has a previous conviction for theft, and in 2012 worked as a prostitute, with the compliance of her husband, the court heard.\n\nThe trial is set to finish on Friday.", "description": "A dispute between two middle aged female office workers led to one murdering the other with a wine bottle and then sawing her head off, a court in France heard on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Peter Allen In France For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/11/20029290-0-image-a-17_1571739492666.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
