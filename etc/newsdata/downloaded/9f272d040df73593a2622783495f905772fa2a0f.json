But then, there were also many \u201cbombshells\u201d during the course of the Mueller investigation that caused a stir in political media and you know how those turned out.\n\nSpeculation about the troubling \u201cpromise\u201d Trump may or may not have made to a foreign leader has naturally focused on Putin and Kim Jong Un. Did he promise Putin he\u2019d make some startling international concession, like exiting NATO, in exchange for God knows what? Did he tell Kim that he\u2019d withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea if Kim did X,Y, and Z? The mind reels. Journalist Laura Rozen flagged this passage from a story yesterday in the Independent, though, that may point in a different direction.\n\nNote that the story has nothing to do with the whistleblower complaint. It\u2019s about Trump\u2019s relations with the new president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky. But the timeline fits. And there\u2019s been some odd media chatter about Trump and Ukraine lately.\n\n[T]here have been claims that Mr Trump had refused to meet Mr Zelensky after his election this year, and that US officials have warned this would continue to be the case unless the Ukrainian authorities reopened the Burisma files. The house committees\u2019 chairs say they will scrutinise a telephone call between the US president and Mr Zelensky on 25 July, during which Mr Trump allegedly told the Ukrainian president to reopen the Biden investigation if he wanted to improve relations with the US. They claim that Kurt Volker, the US special representative for Ukraine, was told to intercede with President Zelensky by the White House, and they are looking into the activities of Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint landed on the inspector general\u2019s desk on August 12. \u201cThe Biden investigation\u201d refers to allegations that Joe Biden leaned on the Ukrainian government while he was VP to fire a prosecutor who just so happened to be looking into a company called Burisma, one of whose directors was Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. That investigation was eventually shut down but Team Trump has taken an interest in seeing it reopened since at least May. Rudy Giuliani was slated to visit Ukraine to lobby for reopening the case that month but canceled his trip when the media noticed. Was the president using his lawyer to muscle a foreign power in order to generate dirt on his most likely 2020 opponent?\n\nA month later, Trump flatly told ABC News that he probably would accept dirt on an opponent from foreign sources. And Giuliani did finally end up meeting the Ukrainians in August to discuss the Biden case and whether any Ukrainian officials tried to damage Trump during the 2016 campaign by sharing dirt with the Democrats.\n\nAs I write this, no newspaper has claimed to know the substance of the whistleblower complaint or what the mystery call between Trump and the foreign leader was about. But whether they really don\u2019t know or *do* know and are withholding the information right now are two different things. There may be natsec reasons not to report what they know, or it may be that they simply can\u2019t nail down the story with sufficient sourcing yet. But WaPo published an editorial two weeks ago about Trump and Ukraine that took the unusual step of introducing some original reporting into the mix \u2014 a strange move for a feature in the opinion section.\n\n[W]e\u2019re reliably told that the president has a second and more venal agenda: He is attempting to force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden. Mr. Trump is not just soliciting Ukraine\u2019s help with his presidential campaign; he is using U.S. military aid the country desperately needs in an attempt to extort it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re reliably told\u201d? Who told them? And why wasn\u2019t that information reliable enough for a news story?\n\nMaybe this was WaPo\u2019s way of teasing what it knew about the whistleblower complaint, tucking it into an editorial while it remains technically unsubstantiated so that it doesn\u2019t have to stake the credibility of the news division on it just yet. If so, the \u201cpromise\u201d Trump may have made to the as yet unnamed foreign leader could be this: \u201cZelensky, if you reopen the Biden investigation and generate dirt on him for me, I promise that you\u2019ll finally get that military aid we\u2019ve pledged.\u201d Lo and behold, after a long delay, just one week ago Ukraine did get the $250 million in U.S. military aid it had been waiting for. Not only that, according to Zelensky it\u2019s getting an extra $140 million. Why? Unclear right now.\n\nThere\u2019s one other thing. The Times reported today, cryptically, that the whistleblower complaint was \u201crelated to a series of actions that go beyond any single discussion with a foreign leader, according to interviews on Thursday.\u201d It\u2019s not just the chat between Trump and the mystery president, it\u2019s other stuff too. That would also potentially fit Ukraine and Zelensky as the subject \u2014 there\u2019s military aid involved, there\u2019s Giuliani leaning on them over the Biden case, there\u2019s the angle involving 2016 dirt. As I say, Trump\u2019s team has showed interest in the Biden matter since at least May, shortly after Grandpa Joe entered the presidential race. There\u2019s more to this than just a phone call, if in fact Zelensky is the leader in question.\n\nIt\u2019s all just speculation. But if it turns out that Trump tried to extort a foreign leader into damaging his 2020 opponent and used taxpayer money to do it, yeah, he\u2019s going to be impeached. Not even Pelosi will be able to stop that train.\n\nIf this actually happened, @realDonaldTrump should be impeached and removed from office without delay. https://t.co/WkiA3yXPEx \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) September 19, 2019\n\nYou can already anticipate the response: \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t Biden impeached when he leaned on the Ukrainians over the prosecutor sniffing around his son\u2019s business?\u201d We may end up spending the better part of next year on that.\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting legal question swirling around all this, as tends to happen with Trump\u2019s uses of presidential power. Does Congress have the constitutional authority to perform oversight of the president on national security? There\u2019s a secondary legal question of whether they have *statutory* authority to perform oversight in this case: According to the Times, the acting DNI and the inspector general have a difference of opinion on the matter, with the IG claiming that the statute says the whistleblower complaint must be handed to Congress and the DNI claiming that Trump technically isn\u2019t part of the \u201cintelligence community,\u201d in which case no, it doesn\u2019t. (Adam Schiff is threatening to sue.)\n\nBut there\u2019s a deeper, and frightening, question of whether Congress is entitled to the complaint under the Constitution even if the courts decide that the IG is right about what the statute says. Read this short but interesting Twitter thread from lawyer Jack Goldsmith who argues \u2026 no, Congress shouldn\u2019t be entitled to know what the president is saying to foreign leaders even if he\u2019s abusing his foreign-policy power. \u201cPutting it brutally,\u201d he writes, \u201cArticle II gives the president the authority to do, and say, and pledge, awful things in the secret conduct of U.S. foreign policy. That is a very dangerous discretion, to be sure, but has long been thought worth it on balance.\u201d The president gets to do what he wants on FoPo and we must simply trust him and hope for the best \u2014 unless, of course, someone in the executive branch leaks his communications and accepts the criminal consequences. That person would go to prison. But Congress would have the material it needs, potentially, to impeach.\n\nUpdate: If only I\u2019d waited a few hours to write this post I could have saved myself some work.
