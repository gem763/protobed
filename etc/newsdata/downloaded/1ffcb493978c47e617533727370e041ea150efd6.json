So, what's behind the crisis?\n\n1. Some big name shops are closing\n\nFashion chains Karen Millen and Coast have recently announced closures. They have more than 200 outlets and concessions between them.\n\nThe fast-growing online fashion chain Boohoo snapped up the brands following their collapse. But Boohoo isn't interested in owning and running physical stores, so the number of closures could creep up.\n\nThe number of empty shops already stands at a record high.\n\nIn July the proportion of all shops that are empty reached 10.3%, its highest level since January 2015.\n\nLast year, big chains such as Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld went bust and vanished altogether.\n\nOthers such as Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look did restructuring deals with their landlords, closing hundreds of shops between them.\n\n2. Shopping habits are changing\n\nIn many ways, retail is a pretty simple business. You have to sell things for more than you paid for them\n\nBut in the past few years, things have become a lot harder for traditional retailers.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Department stores such as Debenhams have been struggling with soaring costs\n\nCompanies have had to deal with rising costs, from wages and business rates to regulatory changes such as the introduction of the European Union's new data law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nAnd, at the same time, retailers are trying to adapt to rapidly changing shopping habits.\n\nConsumers now spend one in every five pounds online - and if businesses are seeing 20% fewer sales on the shop floor as well as their fixed costs rising, then profit margins will be squeezed.\n\nImage caption Online spending usually peaks around the festive season\n\nThis huge shift in spending is disrupting retailers' business models. Too many retailers either fail or are unable to adapt.\n\nThose with underlying problems have suffered.\n\nTake Debenhams, it's been struggling for years. Its previous owners had saddled it with a huge amount of debt and it was tied into long leases.\n\nAnother department store, House of Fraser, was rescued last year by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct. He outlined a plan to create the \"Harrods of the High Street\" and said about 80% of the stores would remain open. But he's now admitted the business was losing more than \u00a31m a week.\n\nConsumers are spending increasing amounts of their disposable income on experiences and lifestyle. Being mediocre isn't good enough anymore.\n\n3. Footfall is declining\n\nShoppers are making fewer visits to High Streets.\n\nThe retail analytics company Springboard tracks footfall in main towns and cities. It's seen a decline in numbers for the past few years.\n\nBad weather and a reduced appetite for spending by consumers have played a role along the way.\n\nConsumers are still shopping, of course. But even with the rise of online, shops need people to walk through the door.\n\n4. Jobs are being cut\n\nFrom March 2016 to 2019, UK retail lost 106,000 jobs according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Those figures are based on data from the Office for National Statistics.\n\nPoundworld saw the biggest job losses, with more than 5,000 redundancies. Toys R Us and Maplin also lost 5,500 jobs between them.\n\nImage copyright PA\n\nThis year, the fallout from various restructurings includes 1,000 job losses and plunging profits at Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group and 100 redundancies at the fashion retailer LK Bennett.\n\nMore job losses will come. More than two years ago, the BRC warned there would be up to 900,000 fewer jobs in retail over the next decade.\n\n5. Tastes are changing\n\nAlthough the first half of this year saw a net decline of 1,234 chain stores on British High Streets, there were some bright spots.\n\nTakeaways, gyms and specialist vaping shops were some categories that saw the largest increases in store openings.\n\nAnalysts have said this demonstrates the High Street's move away from traditional retailing.\n\nSupermarkets Aldi and Lidl are two of the big names also continuing to open lots of stores.\n\nBut the overall picture is the UK has too many shops and in the wrong locations. The winners will be the companies that know what their consumers want and give it to them, with great service and products they want to buy.", "description": "Many retailers have announced store closures and job losses.", "authors": ["Emma Simpson", "Business Correspondent", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13603/production/_108736397_gettyimages-1124600348.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
