He was just turning 40, and had no great successes to his name. He\u2019d been a mining engineer, and didn\u2019t like it. \u201cI was the world\u2019s worst engineer,\u201d he recalls. He\u2019d tried to launch an exercise bike venture. It failed. He was now stuck working as a consultant in the commodities business \u2014 and hated it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear it any more,\u201d he says. \u201cI was absolutely miserable. This was not what I wanted to be doing with my life. I wanted to do something entrepreneurial.\u201d\n\nToday Rolls is worth about half a billion dollars. He\u2019s shaken up a 100-year-old industry, and the London-based company he helped found is quickly becoming a household name: Fevertree Drinks, which makes those very high-end, and expensive, mixers you see in bars and supermarkets. A four -pack of its 6.8-ounce bottles of tonic sells for $5.99 at Target TGT, -1.10% . Competitor Canada Dry\u2019s six-pack of 10-ounce bottles costs $4.29.\n\nHow well is Fevertree doing? Try this: Since the IPO in London, five years ago this November, Fevertree Drinks FEVR, +0.25% stock, measured in U.S. dollars, has outperformed every single U.S. large-cap stock in the S&P 500 SPY, -0.36% stock index. Actually it\u2019s beaten every age, medium and small-sized U.S. company in the broad Standard & Poor\u2019s 1500 index. Not just the index average. It\u2019s beaten every single stock.\n\nKicking yourself for not buying Apple AAPL, -0.44% (up 100%) or Netflix NFLX, -0.86% (up 380%) five years ago? Fevertree is up over 1,000%. A $1,000 stake would now be worth $11,000 and change.\n\nRolls co-founded Fevertree in 2003. (The company is called Fevertree Drinks, but the consumer brand is Fever-Tree). But the story really begins when he was turning 40 and quit his consulting job for a mad, quixotic and seemingly doomed venture. He took all his life savings and, with some backers, bought a dying old gin company in England called Plymouth Gin.\n\n\u201cI knew very little about it,\u201d he says. \u201cI had no relevant experience. I had just this instinctive feeling. I just knew I could turn this thing around.\u201d\n\nA big gamble\n\nIt was a huge gamble. Rolls was newly married \u2014 usually a time when people start to think about playing it safer. Meanwhile the business he bought seemed headed for extinction. \u201cIt was very nearly dead,\u201d he recalls of the company. \u201cWe had no money. Our marketing budget in the first year was 100,000 [British] pounds. [About $220,000 in today\u2019s money] We were losing about 25,000 pounds [$55,000] a month.\u201d The company, founded in 1793, was an aging relic. \u201cI went down to Plymouth [in western England] on a train. It was a most beautiful building. But it was like Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales. I\u2019m pushing open a door, and there were cobwebs. They had a giant copper pot. It was used for distilling twice a year.\u201d He had, he says, about three months to turn it around.\n\nHe believes the parent company, a drinks conglomerate, sold Plymouth Gin to avoid the embarrassment of closing the historic business. Gin at the time was a deeply unfashionable drink, generally associated with retired colonels, golf club bores, and provincial hotels. Rolls bought the company for 500,000 British pounds (a little over $1 million in today\u2019s money). \u201cI picked up an absolute jewel of a brand that no one had done anything with since the 1950s,\u201d Rolls recalls.\n\nAt this stage, the little Rolls knew about the drinks business came from one consulting project. He went into a major bookstore in London, pulled all the books off the shelves relating to the alcohol business, and sat on the floor reading them.\n\n\u201cFortunately, I knew nothing,\u201d says Rolls. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s an advantage not to know anything about a business. I had no relevant experience.\u201d\n\nThere was no money for a major relaunch, and almost no time. He cold-called supermarkets and unloaded the inventory. The cash raised bought a bit more time. He changed the bottle, made the gin stronger, and changed the flavor. He added more \u201cbotanicals\u201d \u2014 herbs, spices and oils. Rolls had anticipated the rebirth of trendy, flavored liquors, especially gins, that has taken place over the past two decades.\n\nFour years later, Plymouth Gin\u2019s sales had risen 1,300%, and Rolls and his backers sold the company for 28 million pounds [$62 million].\n\nMediocre tonic defeated good gin\n\nBut the real story was only just beginning.\n\nWhile running Plymouth, and experimenting with flavors, Rolls had encountered a major problem: No matter how good you made your gin, it was then being diluted with mediocre tonics. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t work out which gin was which,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThere were huge differences in the gins, but the tonic was killing them all.\u201d That was in Britain. In April 2000 he did a taste test of the tonics on the market in the U.S. \u201cThey were even worse than the ones in the U.K.,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThey were far too sweet, had far too little quinine, and they tasted of grapefruit.\u201d\n\nThe lesson stuck with him. Following Plymouth, growing numbers of companies were experimenting with higher end and \u201cartisanal\u201d liquors. Yet the mixers \u2014 tonic, seltzer, ginger ale and so on \u2014 hadn\u2019t changed. They were made by big manufacturers, whose main concern seemed to be cutting costs, so they weren\u2019t undercut by supermarket\u2019s \u201cown label\u201d mixers. In 2003 a young entrepreneur, Tim Warrilow, came to Rolls with the idea to launch a new drinks company. \u201cHe wanted to launch a gin. It was my suggestion to say, forget gin, let\u2019s talk about tonic water. I knew all these markets. And I knew there wasn\u2019t a decent tonic.\u201d\n\nAnd so the idea was born. It took two years, working with specialist flavor companies, to launch the first tonic water. Rolls says he was surprised that one of their hottest early markets was Spain \u2014 where a top chef put a \u201cFevertree\u201d sorbet on his menu. But the product has caught on. There\u2019s been a broader trend among consumers toward more expensive, more \u201cnatural\u201d foods and drinks. And liquors have had a big resurgence, after decades of losing ground. Both factors have helped Fevertree.\n\nToday they\u2019re in 74 countries, and they say they sold 406 million of those little bottles last year. The product line now includes more than a dozen drinks, from \u201cCucumber Tonic Water\u201d to \u201cSicilian Lemonade,\u201d \u201cMadagascar Cola\u201d and \u201cSmoky Ginger Ale.\u201d They\u2019re all made with premium natural ingredients. Fevertree even offers a \u201cpairing guide\u201d on its website, comparable to a fashionista\u2019s color wheel, to work out which expensive mixer goes best with which expensive liquor.\n\n(Among my discoveries during a tasting at the company\u2019s west London headquarters: Why I much preferred \u201cGinger Beer,\u201d an old-fashioned nonalcoholic drink that is now making a comeback, to \u201cGinger Ale.\u201d Apparently they are made in very different ways, which is why the \u201cbeer\u201d has a kick).\n\nThe \u201cLight\u201d tonic water is made with less sugar \u2014 but no artificial sweetener.\n\nRolls, now 62, has since stepped back to a nonexecutive role, though he remains deputy chairman. In the last few years he\u2019s sold stock for about $280 million. His remaining stake is worth about $240 million at current prices.\n\nThe company reorganized its U.S. operations last year, which may have helped boost name recognition among U.S. shoppers. Meanwhile, it remains a surprisingly small company to U.S. eyes. Revenues last year were around $300 million (up 40%), and net income about $100 million (up 36%). The market value is $3.5 billion.\n\nMeanwhile half the sales remain in the U.K. The U.S. accounts for just 15% of sales. And Fevertree\u2019s sales are still tiny compared with the size of the industry, and behemoth rivals such as Coca-Cola KO, +0.09%, PepsiCo PEP, +0.34%, and Keurig Dr Pepper KDP, +0.93%.
