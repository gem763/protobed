Fighting for women.\n\n\"So that's what I do and I guess that's what he does.\"\n\nRose alleged Harvey Weinstein raped her at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997.\n\nShe threw her weight behind the #metoo movement in Hollywood where several high profile actors and many people from behind the scenes reported abuses of power they experienced.\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\nRose continued: \"I'm not TV every day like he is, but i am doing the best I can do. Piers is an affable fellow in real life, but in TV I think he's giving his audience what he wants but I think he's doing a disservice to people.\"\n\nThe petition to remove Piers says he spreads \"dangerous misinformation\u201d about trans people as part of an \u201cinsidious agenda\u201d that reduces LGBT+ people to a \u201cmere joke\u201d.\n\nShe added: \"This is the kind of dehumanising dismissal of transgender/non-binary/gender-fluid individuals that perpetuates those suicide rates and keeps them alarmingly high\", it says.\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\nWhen asked if she thought Piers was damaging to society, Rose replied: \"Absolutely.\"\n\nShe added: \"I hope he doesn't realise the damage he does, because that would mean something really awful. But I think people like that can't help it.\n\n\"Why are you attacking people who are coming out and telling the truth and sharing their pain? You're attacking people who have been victimised and are trying to survive and live.\n\n\"It's not a good look.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nRose said that she hoped the #MeToo movement would \"continue to inspire people to speak out - both men and women.\n\nShe said: \"It's about disrupting power abuse.\"\n\nRose added that she was \"not surprised at all\" that men started coming forward to talk about their experience of abuse and discrimination in the industry, including actor Terry Crews who said he was assaulted by a \"high level Hollywood executive\".\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\nShe said: \"Power abuse doesn't just happen to women. We just never had a way to articulate it before, and I'm so happy that men are coming out of the shadows because the more we normalise going up against the abuse of power, the more power we personally have as a society.\"\n\nLast month, Rose spoke on Channel 5's Jeremy Vine about the #MeToo movement.\n\nShe told Jeremy: \"Me Too is a conversation all of us growing up and having a grown up conversation we should have had a long time ago because people are dying.\"\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nRose said she does not usually talk about Weinstein, but said she worked with the New York Times for months to get the story out.\n\nIt broke in 2017 and outed Weinstein for the alleged assaults against him, with many people having been reportedly paid off to keep them quiet.\n\nWeinstein has continued to deny he carried out sex attacks against a string of women, insisting that all his sexual encounters have been \"consensual\".", "description": "The actress looked angelic at the Q Awards as she blasted Piers Morgan for his \"archaic\" views on gender and called him damaging to society", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Redferns", "Itv", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637150.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Q-Awards-2019-Red-Carpet-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
