Any potential obstacles the user encounters while traversing real space are recorded by real-time sensing technologies in the VR apparatus, including a dual-band GPS sensor, two RGB depth cameras, and \"a Windows Mixed Reality-provided relative position trace.\" Those obstacles may be replaced by obstacles in the virtual world, such as road blocks. Additionally, a video-game quest marker-like arrow will direct the user in what is deemed to be a safe and efficient traversal direction.\n\n\"Discovered obstacles that may move or appear in users' paths are managed by introducing moving virtual obstacles, or characters, such as pedestrians walking near users, to block them from any potential danger,\" the blog post explains. \"Other options for controlling users' paths may include pets and dynamic events such as vehicles being parked, moving carts, and more, limited only by the imagination of the experience creator.\"\n\nThe system tries its best to introduce these virtual objects outside of the user's field of view to minimize unrealistic popup, not dissimilar to how a 3D video game environment uses streaming and frustum culling to maximize performance or introduce new assets to the scene.\n\nDreamWalker actually uses another Microsoft Research-developed tech called Mise-Unseen\u2014which \"allows covert changes to be made to a VR environment while a user's gaze and attention are fixed on something else\"\u2014to do this thanks to eye-tracking tech.\n\nWhile DreamWalker had a predecessor project called VRoamer that attempted to deliver safe experiences in uncontrolled indoor environments, most applications of VR being researched today or sold to consumers or businesses require a controlled space for safe use. DreamWalker is not ready for the public yet, but it's a step toward unexpected applications of VR that may have previously only been considered for AR\u2014though there's a lot of crossover in AR and VR research and product development across the industry.\n\nWhen Google Glass was first introduced many years ago, some commentators worried about the privacy and safety implications. Several Pok\u00e9mon Go-related accidents introduced more questions about how technology companies can act responsibly when selling AR or VR products or experiences and what municipalities and legislators need to be thinking about moving forward. And with Apple expected to launch AR glasses as soon as next year, these questions are only going to become more pressing. It was enough to think about safety when using AR in public spaces, but the potential challenges and applications for VR in public will need further consideration, too.\n\nMicrosoft's researchers have published a paper with more technical details if you want to learn more about how it works.", "description": "It guides you through real environs while immersing you in virtual ones.", "authors": ["Samuel Axon"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Microsoft-Research-DreamWalker-1-760x380.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
