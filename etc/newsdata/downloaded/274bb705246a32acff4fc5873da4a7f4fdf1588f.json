The HBO series is a follow-up rather than an adaptation of its source, set in an alternate present, more than three decades after the events of Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, and John Higgins\u2019s industry-realigning 1986 comic \u2014 er, graphic novel. Watchmen was ground zero, along with contemporaneous works like Frank Miller\u2019s Ronin and The Dark Knight Returns and Moore\u2019s The Killing Joke, for the \u201cgrim and gritty\u201d craze that continues to this day. True to the spirit of those inquisitive, psychology-driven revisionist \u201980s works, Lindelof\u2019s series never loses sight of the core question of why people would don masks, even in situations where it\u2019s not important to hide who they are.\n\nWatchmen\u2019s restless dystopia (utopias don\u2019t exist onscreen anymore) is riven by racism and class anxiety, even more so than the present-day United States, and the country seems to have made peace with a mutated version of authoritarian rule \u2014 although the fact that the strongman running the country is liberal environmentalist and gun-control advocate Robert Redford, still chugging along after 26 years as president, complicates the analogies to Trump\u2019s America. (Redford is not in the series, but his name is spoken often.) There\u2019s a racially motivated hot war between the guardians of the state and racist elements in the populace, represented by a melting-pot police force that wears masks over the lower parts of their faces to prevent enemies from identifying and murdering them. (The official police masks are bright yellow, evoking the Watchmen series\u2019s insignia, the Comedian\u2019s badge.) The main antagonists are the Seventh Cavalry, a Ku Klux Klan\u2013inspired militia that stockpiles weapons and attacks public officials and institutions while wearing masks inspired by Rorschach, a character from the original comic who was the only vigilante who refused to be employed by the U.S. government. (The use of masks here feels like an escalation of one of Moore\u2019s conceits: The U.S. government banned masked vigilantes in the 1970s.)\n\nIt makes sense that Cavalry members would wear masks when carrying out terrorist actions and committing crimes, and that the police would wear their own, often more personalized and makeshift masks while on duty, and while carrying out off-the-books vigilante missions \u2014 as when detective Angela Abar (Regina King) decides to capture a suspect in a police shooting without authorization, and puts on the costume of her own alter ego, Sister Night, a flowing hooded cloak and black face paint. But there are many other moments where characters wear them even though they have no apparent reason to, like the police surveillance expert who covers her face while monitoring a Cavalry hideout from inside an armored police hovercraft. And one of Angela\u2019s fellow officers, Looking Glass (Tim Blake Nelson), wears a silvery ski mask with no eyeholes (how does he see?) even when he\u2019s at home watching the news and eating an old-fashioned TV dinner out of an aluminum tin. Sometimes he lifts the mask up so that you can see his eyes, but usually all you get is that distinctively Nelsonian mouth and scraggly whiskers. Does wearing a mask liberate or hide these characters? A bit of both, probably, because people are complicated.\n\nFans of the source material are either going to love this Watchmen or despise it \u2014 the latter, perhaps, because of the selective amnesia afflicting reactionary comic fans who insist that the art form \u201cdidn\u2019t used to be political\u201d when it was political from the jump, and progressive more often than not. Moore and Gibbons\u2019s series was released midway through Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term and contained many elements that seemed to warn of latent fascistic tendencies within the United States\u2019 cultural identity, including an obsession with superheroes and supervillains who settled ideological and personal differences through city-leveling mayhem, and often claimed to be acting on behalf of higher principles even when projecting their personal issues onto the world. The series\u2019 storylines concentrate on American discrimination from Watchmen\u2019s opening sequence, a recreation of the 1921 Tulsa riot, in which a white mob destroyed an affluent African-American section of town known as Black Wall Street. (Survivors and descendants of the victims of the Tulsa riots sued for compensation, referred to here as Redfordations.) This theme threads through each successive hour, investing even moments that are theoretically about the characters\u2019 personal lives with a dread of impending racial violence. There\u2019s plenty of the literal kind, including police raids on a Cavalry staging area and a crackdown on a fenced-in trailer park called Nixonville. (There\u2019s a giant statue of the disgraced president out front, both hands raised overhead in a \u201cvictory\u201d symbol.) But Lindelof and company invest these and other seemingly straightforward scenes with touches that complicate an easy reading (or just muddle things up). The images of poor whites fenced in by armed police plays into Trump fantasies of the dominant demographic in the U.S. as an embattled minority, beset by deep-state forces and muzzled by political correctness. And for avatars of righteousness, the cops on this show are quite comfortable with torture, which the series portrays as a not merely defensible but effective means of extracting useful information.\n\nWhile early episodes keep a tight focus on the race war happening on the ground in Tulsa (this is surely the only time that a lavishly budgeted TV fantasy has been set there), Watchmen slowly widens its view to incorporate other characters, some of whom are drawn from the original series. Adrian Veidt (Jeremy Irons), a.k.a. Ozymandias, long missing and officially declared dead, is secretly living in a remote ch\u00e2teau, where he rides horses, dines in the nude, and is attended to by young servants who double as actors in his plays. The great Jean Smart, fresh off FX\u2019s psychedelic comic-book adaptation Legion, plays an older, more hard-bitten version of Silk Spectre, a crime fighter from the source work. The all-powerful Dr. Manhattan, who left Earth at the end of the original story, is briefly mentioned as living on Mars, and his non-presence here eventually becomes Kurtz-like: You feel his ominous energy even when nobody\u2019s discussing him. Among the new characters, the standout is Angela\u2019s boss, Chief Judd Crawford (Don Johnson), who wears a white hat and professes to have enjoyed an \u201call-black\u201d local production of Oklahoma! (This is the most charming that Johnson has been since the original Miami Vice \u2014 although his casting in this part, as well as the character\u2019s Oklahoma!-derived name, guarantees that the character\u2019s no saint.)\n\nBeyond the embellishments and reimaginings of the source material, the biggest hurdle this Watchmen will face is the way it tells its story. Although each chapter has the feel of a stand-alone, \u00e0 la The Leftovers, it\u2019s ultimately a highly serialized tale, though one that takes its sweet time easing you into its world and making you work to understand who\u2019s who and what\u2019s actually happening. It\u2019s easy to imagine viewers who aren\u2019t already invested in the very idea of a Watchmen sequel growing impatient with the show\u2019s gradual doling out of exposition; this might turn out to be a case where it\u2019s better to watch the entire thing later, in a single sitting, to see how it all comes together, and to eliminate the feeling that not enough is happening. Still, the sheer nerve of the thing is admirable, as is Lindelof\u2019s determination to make a newish comic-book series that\u2019s bound to be as divisive as the work that sparked his imagination as a teenager.", "description": "A review of \u201cWatchmen\u201d on HBO, a sequel series to the 1986 comic by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, overseen by creator Damon Lindelof and starring Regina King, Tim Blake Nelson, Jeremy Irons, Don Johnson, and Jean Smart.", "authors": ["Matt Zoller Seitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/16/16-watchmen-review.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
