Nearly 18 percent of exoplanets have been found this way.\n\nSHADOW SEARCHING \u2013 When a planet passes directly between its star and an observer \u2014 an astronomer peering through a telescope, or a satellite in space \u2014 it dims the star\u2019s light by a tiny but measurable amount.\n\nThis \u201ctransit\u201d method has been the most successful so far \u2014 NASA\u2019s Kepler spacecraft used it to find thousands of candidate planets from 2009 to 2013, and around 80 percent of all exoplanets have been found this way.\n\nMore recently, NASA\u2019s TESS satellite was launched in 2018, able to analyse much brighter stars for smaller planets, and the European CHEOPS satellite, which aims to better analyse known exoplanets, is set for launch in the coming weeks.\n\nPICTURE PRODUCING \u2013 Snapping a picture of an exoplanet in front of its star is akin to trying to photograph a microscopic speck of dust on a glowing lightbulb. But by removing the blinding glare of the star, astronomers can capture an image, a method called direct imaging.\n\nOnly just more than one percent of distant planets have been detected this way.\n\nBEAM BENDING \u2013 In this technique, light from a distant star is bent and focused by gravity as an orbiting planet passes between the star and Earth.\n\nCalled gravitational micro-lensing, the gravity of the planet and star focus light rays of the distant planet on an observer in the same way that a magnifying glass focuses the sun\u2019s light onto a tiny, bright spot. Only a handful of exoplanets have been found using this method.\n\n\u2013 What conditions might support life? \u2013\n\nOf the exoplanets found to date, only a handful are in a \u201ctemperate\u201d zone in relation to their star: not so hot that water evaporates, not so cold that it freezes solid.\n\nLife on Earth is also unimaginable without an atmosphere, containing in our case the oxygen organisms need to survive. An atmosphere also protects animal species in particular from damaging high-energy radiation from a star\u2019s ultraviolet and X-rays.\n\nBut without a definitive understanding as to how life emerged on Earth, it is possible that living creatures elsewhere in the universe could survive and thrive in gases, chemicals or temperatures that would be lethal for us.\n\nScientists are now evaluating potential chemical combinations that might indicate alien life \u2014 which might be nothing like we know it.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 This year\u2019s Nobel Prize for Physics honoured Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, Swiss astronomers who proved the existence of a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/0a6c46_an-artist-impression-exoplanet-55-cancri-so-called-super-earth-in-solar-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
