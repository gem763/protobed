When the inevitable articles of impeachment emerge over Ukraine-Gate, the 218-185 vote to table Schiff\u2019s censure will closely resemble the eventual passing vote.\n\nOtherwise, this was as predictable as humidity on the Potomac in summertime, and every bit as useful:\n\nRepublicans failed to force a vote on the House floor on Monday evening on a resolution that would have censured House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for his handling of the impeachment inquiry. Democrats, who control the chamber, killed the GOP effort after House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., offered a motion to table the measure. The motion was adopted in a 218-185 vote. Schiff tweeted minutes after the vote, \u201cIt will be said of House Republicans, When they found they lacked the courage to confront the most dangerous and unethical president in American history, They consoled themselves by attacking those who did.\u201d Introduced by Arizona Republican Andy Biggs, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, the resolution alleged that Schiff \u201cmanufactured a false retelling\u201d of the phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukraine\u2019s leader, instead of quoting from the record of the conversation released by the White House. Schiff made the remarks at a Sept. 26 hearing on a whistleblower complaint about the phone call.\n\nThe censure might have been better aimed at Schiff\u2019s serial false claims to have already unearthed direct evidence of collusion between Trump, his campaign, and Russian intelligence. After Robert Mueller\u2019s report declared that no such evidence exists, that exposed Schiff\u2019s tendency toward McCarthyist hysterics. The infamous \u201cparody\u201d was more of an embarrassment than actually damaging, but perhaps it got more attention, and so became the focus of the GOP\u2019s attack.\n\nWhich, come to think of it, pretty much describes the Democrats\u2019 decision to focus on Ukraine-Gate for impeachment, too. Both turn out to be partisan hysterics used to justify a desired end. Last night\u2019s censure effort appeared to have come without much if any effort to get House Democrats on board, just like Schiff\u2019s kangaroo-court impeachment process is almost designed to keep the effort from any hint of bipartisanship. Both parties seem willing to trade credibility for id-venting.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan spoke with Fox Business Channel\u2019s Lou Dobbs after the vote to discuss all the ways in which House Democrats are to blame for what happened. Dobbs offers another prime suspect for the failure of the House to censure Schiff \u2026 Paul Ryan?\n\n\u201cThe vote was a close one, though,\u201d Dobbs declared. \u201cJust think what would have happened in that vote if, well, if Paul Ryan hadn\u2019t thrown away the House.\u201d First off, the vote wasn\u2019t all that close, but what does Paul Ryan have to do with anything? Ryan announced his retirement from politics in April 2018, long before the midterms, which were lost in what was a relatively normal correction after a change in presidents. The GOP tried running on immigration rather than a booming economy in 2018\u2019s midterms, which ended up alienating (no pun intended) suburban voters. Ryan had very little to do with the election; it was, as is usually the case, a referendum on the president.\n\nAnd, needless to say, the vote wouldn\u2019t have taken place at all if the GOP had kept the House in the midterms. Schiff wouldn\u2019t be in charge of anything, and the House wouldn\u2019t be dealing with a partisan Democratic effort to avenge their loss in 2016. There may be a lot of people to blame for that outcome, but it\u2019s just weird to pull Paul Ryan out of thin air as a bete noire. If Democrats manage to lose the House next year after wasting all of 2019 on impeachment, though, Nancy Pelosi will end up with the blame for that. If \u2026", "description": "Dobbs: The fault is ...
