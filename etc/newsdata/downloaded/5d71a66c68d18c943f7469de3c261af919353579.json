All the possible scenarios explained!", "language": "en", "text": "Cape Town - Who the Springboks will face in the quarter-finals of the 2019 Rugby World Cup on Sunday, October 20 will only be decided following the completion of the Japan v Scotland Pool A clash on Sunday.\n\nSeveral permutations remain, so let Sport24 break it down for you.\n\nWhat we know for sure:\n\n- The Springboks finished as runners-up in Pool B and will as a result play the winners of Pool A in the quarter-finals.\n\n- The Springboks can either play Ireland or Japan.\n\n- As per World Rugby's tournament rules, if two teams are tied on log points, the tiebreaker is 'who won the pool match between those two teams'.\n\nWhat we don't know for sure:\n\n- Who the winners of Pool A will be!\n\n- As it currently stands heading into the Japan v Scotland match, Ireland are top of the standings on 16 points (having completed their matches). Hosts Japan are second on 14, while Scotland trail on 10 - both with their final match to play on Sunday.\n\n\n\n- Should Japan beat Scotland (with a bonus point or not), Japan will finish top of the standings and will play the Springboks in the quarter-finals.\n\n- Should Japan lose to Scotland, but pick up 2 bonus points (for losing by 7 or fewer points and scoring 4 tries), Japan will finish top of the standings by virtue of the fact Japan beat Ireland 19-12 in their pool match - and will play the Springboks in the quarter-finals.\n\n- Similarly, should the match be cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis OR end in a draw after 80 minutes, both sides will pick up 2 points and, as above, Japan will play the Springboks in the quarter-finals.\n\n- Should Japan lose to Scotland, but pick up 1 bonus point (for either losing by 7 or fewer points or scoring 4 tries), Ireland will finish top of the standings and will play the Springboks in the quarter-finals.\n\n- Should Japan lose to Scotland and pick up no bonus points, Ireland will finish top of the standings and will play the Springboks in the quarter-finals.\n\nFor what it's worth, leading SA bookmakers Sportingbet have Scotland as 3-point favourites.\n\nThe all-important Japan v Scotland match at the International Stadium in Yokohama will kick off on Sunday at 12:45 SA time.", "description": "Who the Springboks will face in the quarter-finals of the 2019 Rugby World Cup will only be decided following the completion of the Japan v Scotland clash on Sunday.", "authors": ["Garrin Lambley - Editor"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9468/669357b3c0d64d5fb32e026486219173.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
