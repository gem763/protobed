Photo: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for ABA\n\nIf her memoir had only gifted us with the news that Jon Cryer has, in fact, slept with more than one person and may just be bad at sex, it would have been worth it. But Demi Moore doesn\u2019t stop there in her memoir Inside Out, which just debuted atop the New York Times\u2019 best-seller list. \u201cThank you guys for reading and allowing it to resonate with you,\u201d Moore posted to Instagram. But along with Cryer, who else might this bona fide gem of literature resonate with? No fewer than 14 other celebrities who appear in its pages, among them movie stars, musicians, and all-around A-listers; lovers, friends, and a president\u2019s daughters. We know you might\u2019ve seen bits and pieces elsewhere, but we pulled together all the juicy details for you in one place.\n\nRoman Polanski, director\n\nWhen Moore\u2019s mother took her to live in West Hollywood, they lived in the same apartment complex as German actress Nastassja Kinski, then working on her English so she could star in Roman Polanski\u2019s movie Tess. \u201cOne night she took me along to dinner with Polanski,\u201d Moore remembers. \u201cHe tracked me down to invite me to dinner a second time months later, and I went with my mom. He was a perfect gentleman on both of those evenings, but he had been convicted of having sex with a thirteen-year-old girl. (I saw this dynamic all around me. Thirteen was a little extreme, but in my world, believe it or not, relationships with underage girls was the norm.)\u201d Just a few days later, Moore notes, Polanski fled the U.S. to avoid sentencing after pleading guilty and finished Tess in France.\n\nAnthony Kiedis and Flea, Red Hot Chili Peppers musicians and high-school classmates\n\nUnbeknownst to her at the time, Moore overlapped with future Red Hot Chili Peppers bandmates Anthony Kiedis and Flea when she went to Fairfax High School in L.A. \u201cI seriously doubt I was cool enough to run with their crowd,\u201d Moore says of her now-friends. We just want to know: Were they actually cool in high school? And how much did they smoke? Guess we\u2019ll have to wait for that in Flea\u2019s memoir.\n\nFred Moore, musician and first husband\n\nAs the tale goes, Moore married Fred Moore three months after she turned 18, shortly after dropping out of high school \u2014 but she reveals in her memoir that it also came after her father\u2019s apparent suicide. \u201cThe night before we got married, instead of working on my vows, I was calling a guy I\u2019d met on a movie set. I snuck out of my own bachelorette party and went to his apartment,\u201d she writes. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I go and see the man I was committing to spend the rest of my life with to express my doubts? Because I couldn\u2019t face the fact that I was getting married to distract myself from grieving the death of my father. Because I felt like there was no room to question what I\u2019d already put in motion.\u201d Later, when filming Blame It on Rio in Brazil, Moore lived with a cameraman named Peter and \u201cnearly burned a hole through my nostrils\u201d from her developing cocaine habit. \u201cIt was easy to forget I was married \u2014 to the point that one night Peter and I ended up in bed,\u201d Moore writes, and while she notes it only happened once, it sparked her divorce from Fred.\n\nRob Lowe, St. Elmo\u2019s Fire co-star\n\nThis one isn\u2019t exactly news, according to Moore, because Rob Lowe already told the tale in his own tell-all, the aptly titled Stories I Only Tell My Friends. She remembers things differently, though: \u201cIn his own memoir, Rob suggests that we had some kind of hot-and-heavy romance,\u201d Moore writes. \u201cI can vaguely recall one ill-advised late night together, but I\u2019m grateful to him for the complimentary descriptions of our youth.\u201d\n\nEmilio Estevez, St. Elmo\u2019s Fire co-star and ex-fianc\u00e9\n\nHer life may have played out in a drastically different way had Moore married Emilio Estevez, whom she first met on the set of St. Elmo\u2019s Fire and later got engaged to after her time in rehab. \u201cEmilio and I had in fact just mailed out the invitations for our wedding when a friend told me she had seen him out with someone else in L.A.,\u201d Moore remembers. \u201cHe denied it, of course, but I was having a hard time trusting him: during a two-week breakup a few months before, he\u2019d slept with an \u2018ex\u2019 girlfriend, lied about it and then been forced to tell me the truth when he found out she was pregnant.\u201d She brought him in to talk with her therapist, she reveals: \u201cWhen he revealed his priorities in that session \u2014 you\u2019ll be shocked to hear \u2014 I was pretty low on the list. I postponed the wedding indefinitely.\u201d\n\nEd Zwick, About Last Night director\n\nAfter she gave up drinking and cocaine, Moore writes, \u201call my anxieties shifted over to food.\u201d As she worked to get cast in the rom-com About Last Night, starring an \u201cold pal,\u201d Rob Lowe, director Ed Zwick confronted her about her weight. \u201cWhen I went to see him at his office in L.A., my worst nightmare came true: he sat down and said, \u2018You are really who I would like to do this film, but you would have to promise me that you would lose weight,\u201d Moore says. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that moment as long as I live.\u201d She had gained weight, she adds, but this instance kick-started an eating disorder, marked by obsessing over her diet and binge-eating.\n\nBruce Willis, actor and second husband\n\nAlthough Moore claims that she\u2019s \u201cvery proud\u201d of her divorce from second husband Bruce Willis and the way they\u2019ve co-parented their three children, that doesn\u2019t keep her from subtly (and not so subtly) shading him throughout her book. When they first met at the premiere of Stakeout, \u201cmy impression was, he\u2019s kind of a jerk,\u201d But they got to know each other at the after-party: \u201cHe was so attentive as the evening progressed, I was stunned to find out later that he\u2019d actually been on a date that night with another woman!\u201d After they married and had their first child, Rumer, Willis was leaving to shoot Hudson Hawk and \u201che dropped a bombshell: \u2018I don\u2019t know if I want to be married,\u2019\u201d Moore remembers. \u201cI think that as a true Pisces, he was struggling to resolve a conflict within himself: he wanted family and grounding, but he also craved excitement and novelty,\u201d she observes. \u201cBasically, he wanted to do whatever the fuck he wanted. Not so unusual in men that age \u2014 he was thirty-six at the time \u2014 and throw in celebrity and money? You do the math.\u201d Yet he wouldn\u2019t commit to leaving, either, and the night he returned from the shoot, Moore became pregnant with Scout. Men!\n\nAdrian Lyne, Indecent Proposal director\n\nWhen Moore rold Adrian Lyne she lost weight for the movie\u2019s sex scenes, \u201che just kept looking at me with a disturbed expression on his face,\u201d she writes. \u201cFinally, he spat, \u2018I don\u2019t want you looking like a fucking man!\u2019\u201d She notes that he threatened to fire her, through her agent, if she didn\u2019t lose 10 pounds, before backing down. Moore\u2019s friend Glenn Close had in fact warned her of her experiences with Lyne on the set of Fatal Attraction, when he \u201cwas yelling out encouraging obscenities\u201d during her sex scenes with Michael Douglas. \u201cGlenn hadn\u2019t exaggerated,\u201d Moore notes. (Lesson learned: Always trust Glenn Close.) \u201cHe literally didn\u2019t stop talking \u2014 practically hollering! \u2014 the whole time we were shooting the sex scenes,\u201d Moore says of Lyne. \u201c\u2018Fucking raunchy! Oh god, got a boner on that!\u2019 he\u2019d yell. Come on, grab his dick!\u2019\u201d She reflects, \u201cAt first it was creepy \u2026 but once I got used to it, I saw its advantages: having Adrian carry on that way took the focus off my awkwardness because he was so over-the-top.\u201d\n\nAshton Kutcher, actor and third husband\n\nKutcher has already acknowledged his inclusion in Moore\u2019s book, which describes him pushing for threesomes and eventually cheating on her. He tweeted an apparent reference to Moore\u2019s revelations the day after the book came out, claiming, \u201cI was about to push the button on a really snarky tweet. Then I saw my son, daughter, and wife and I deleted it.\u201d A source also told People that this hasn\u2019t shaken his marriage to Mila Kunis, saying, \u201cNothing came out in this book that Mila did not already know.\u201d But along with the cheating, Moore describes Kutcher becoming \u201cless and less present\u201d after he spent a week in Europe and she quit Vicodin cold turkey. She adds, \u201cHe was focused on other things: his work; his growing involvement in the tech world; his fantasy football league.\u201d Don\u2019t we all know that guy? When Moore wanted to get pregnant with him again after previously miscarrying, he agreed to use an egg donor, only to back out of it four days later. According to her, he replied, \u201cI never thought you\u2019d go through with it.\u201d They later divorced amid his confirmed cheating. (If you feel like he did Moore dirty, why don\u2019t you text him about it?)\n\nJanuary Jones, actress and Kutcher\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9\n\nKutcher was engaged to January Jones when he first moved to L.A., and he once thought she cheated on him with Willis while they filmed Bandits together, Kutcher later told Moore. \u201cYears later, I happened to sit next to January at an event, and I mentioned this,\u201d writes Moore, who, if you haven\u2019t guessed by now, holds nothing back. \u201c\u2018Are you serious?\u2019 she said, laughing. \u2018I told him a hundred times, I didn\u2019t want to fuck that old man!\u2019\u201d That may not be the way to talk about the father of someone\u2019s children around them, but for the record, Willis was 46 at the time, while Jones was 23.\n\nBarbara Pierce Bush and Jenna Bush Hager, activist and TV host\n\nKutcher\u2019s Beverly Hills bachelor pad was \u201ca straight-up L.A. party house\u201d before Moore came into his life. \u201cGeorge Bush was president at the time, and somehow his twin daughters ended up doing bong hits at that house at one of Ashton\u2019s parties,\u201d Moore writes. \u201cHe was sure the Secret Service was listening in on his calls from then on.\u201d Malia Obama would like her apology now, thank you.\n\nLena Dunham, herself\n\nOkay, so we\u2019re not totally sure about this one, but Moore does leave an acknowledgment to a \u201cLena D.,\u201d and we know one of those. She simply writes, \u201cYou are magic.\u201d That\u2019s \u2026 one way to put it!\n\nBonus Ashton Kutcher content!\n\n\ufeffThe day Moore introduced Kutcher to her daughters, \u201cthey all started whispering, \u2018Is that ASHTON KUTCHER?!?\u2019\u201d (a totally normal response); Willis thought at first that Moore had brought him specifically to meet their children, \u201cthe way we\u2019d once arranged for Aaron Carter to come to Disney World for Scout\u2019s birthday.\u201d In those early days of their relationship, the couple bonded over their shared interest in Kabbalah, and Kutcher also introduced her to Twitter (which she must regret, like the rest of us).", "description": "After Demi Moore\u2019s tell-all memoir Inside Out prompted Jon Cryer to clarify that he did not lose his virginity to her, here are the stories she wrote about 14 other celebrities.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/27/27-demi-moore.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
