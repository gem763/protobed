Eamon Gallagher\n\nThe Productivity Commission's three-year probe into the efficiency and competitiveness of the superannuation system concluded that consumers could gain $3.8 billion a year by addressing unintended multiple accounts and entrenched underperforming funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUndoubtedly, part of the attraction to a public default super fund to some political conservatives, such as Costello and Liberal backbencher Tim Wilson, is to negate the meteoric rise of union-aligned industry super funds.\n\nIndustry funds have outperformed for-profit retail funds and are less financially conflicted in maximising returns for members.\n\nNevertheless, there are legitimate public policy and investment arguments for a sovereign fund to manage super, backed by non-partisans such as businessman John Wylie (who knows super architect Paul Keating from working together at Lazard), index pioneer Graham Tuckwell and former adviser to Labor treasurer John Dawkins, economist Nicholas Gruen.\n\nIn a system where the government mandates almost 10 per cent of people\u2019s wages be deferred and clipped by money managers, and there is a chronic underperformance and fee-gouging by a large minority of funds, a low-fee public default fund is worthy of considering.\n\nThe investment profile, return targets, time horizons and liquidity requirements for a public super fund would be different to the strong-performing $163 billion Future Fund.\n\nThe money would not be lumped into the same pool - another ill-informed criticism by the super industry.\n\nRather than arguing a public fund would be incapable of handling super, the super industry would be better served by pointing to the same fiscal risks as the Productivity Commission.\n\nThe commission said the biggest risk of a government \"monopoly\" fund was that in the event of poor performance there could be significant political pressure on the government to \"top up\" returns for members and taxpayers could be put at risk.\n\nThen again, with the super juggernaut close to $3 trillion and set to hit $5 trillion by 2030, some argue there is already an implicit guarantee on our super funds just like the big banks.", "description": "If super funds run by former politicians and union officials are capable of handling the administration of super, then surely it is not beyond the capability of a government fund.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3023%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_639%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cba81c2708071dba09cb44dc8037d24664a1920d", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
