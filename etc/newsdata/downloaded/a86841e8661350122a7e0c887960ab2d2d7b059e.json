After the Jets declined the penalty, the clock started again, and the Patriots\u2019 punt team waited until they were about to get another delay of game, then false started. The Jets declined the false start penalty, too, the clock started again, and then the Patriots finally punted.\n\nWhen the Patriots\u2019 third-down play ended, 11:05 remained in the fourth quarter. By the time the Patriots actually punted on fourth down, 9:43 remained. The whole point of the play clock is that teams can\u2019t take more than 40 seconds between plays, but the Patriots, thanks to that running clock after their penalties, took 1 minute, 22 seconds.\n\nPatriots coach Bill Belichick was shown on television smirking on the sideline after that series of penalties, and he acknowledged after the game that the penalties allowed him to take plenty of extra time off the clock. He added that league rules probably shouldn\u2019t allow that.\n\n\u201cNo, it was just the way the rules are set up. We were able to run quite a bit of time off the clock without really having to do anything. That\u2019s probably a loophole that will be closed and probably should be closed but right now it\u2019s open,\u201d Belichick said.\n\nThe Patriots were so far ahead in the fourth quarter that it really didn\u2019t matter, but Belichick is right that this loophole should be closed. Teams shouldn\u2019t be able to take more than 40 seconds off the clock between plays. Perhaps this is a rule Belichick wants to see changed, and he was waiting until just the right time to demonstrate that it needs to change.", "description": "With the Patriots leading 33-0 in the fourth quarter on Monday night, they took a delay of game penalty with their punt team on the field.
