The piece was an excerpt from their upcoming book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.\u201d\n\nThe excerpt showed up in the opinion section, which caused confusion.\n\nWe would like to address the questions we\u2019re seeing related to a book excerpt in today\u2019s Sunday Review section. \u2014 NYTimes Communications (@NYTimesPR) September 15, 2019\n\nThe book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation\u201d by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, is a well-reported and newsworthy account that reveals new details and sheds new light on a matter of significant national interest. \u2014 NYTimes Communications (@NYTimesPR) September 15, 2019\n\nThe excerpt of the book was published in the Sunday Review, a section that includes both news analysis and opinion pieces. The section frequently runs excerpts of books produced by Times reporters. \u2014 NYTimes Communications (@NYTimesPR) September 15, 2019\n\nBut, according to the Times, the excerpt didn't show up in the newspaper beforehand because the revelation came about during the book's research.\n\nThe new revelations contained in the piece were uncovered during the reporting process for the book, which is why this information did not appear in The Times before the excerpt. \u2014 NYTimes Communications (@NYTimesPR) September 15, 2019\n\nAnd, to make things worse, someone at the news outlet wrote a disgusting tweet promoting the excerpt. But it wasn't long before the tweet was deleted.\n\nThe Times said they are \"reviewing the decision-making with those involved\" in handing the outlet's social media accounts.\n\nAlso, a tweet that went out from the @NYTOpinion account yesterday was clearly inappropriate and offensive. We apologize for it and are reviewing the decision-making with those involved. \u2014 NYTimes Communications (@NYTimesPR) September 15, 2019\n\nThe Federalist's Mollie Hemingway pointed out a couple very important facts about this book, the biggest issue being the lack of corroboration.\n\nThe book notes, quietly, that the woman Max Stier named as having been supposedly victimized by Kavanaugh and friends denies any memory of the alleged event. Seems, I don\u2019t know, significant. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nAuthors go after Kavanaugh as \u201cdisingenuous\u201d for quoting incendiary things said **about him** by Senate Democrats while ignoring that Trump had said \u201cacidic\u201d and \u201cdenigrating\u201d things like when he \u201cbelittled the North Korean leader Kim Jong-in.\u201d Really. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nLeland Keyser, the sole female witness named by Christine Blasey Ford is quoted by NYT reporters saying \"I don't have any confidence in the story.\" We previously published the full explosive details in Justice on Trial. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nThe NYT reporters, it goes without saying, downplay the significance of this and all the other many facts/stories/quotes/details that cast doubt on the unsupported allegations against Kavanaugh. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nThe Times is quick, yet again, to drag Kavanaugh's name through the mud yet they cherry pick what \"facts\" they present. Even based on the wording and phrases used in the excerpt, it's clear the reporters have their own personal vendetta: they want Kavanaugh ousted from the Supreme Court.", "description": "Nice try..09/15/2019 19:10:04PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/283/4b28ff5f-8664-4e42-bae7-acd9d0849d0e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
