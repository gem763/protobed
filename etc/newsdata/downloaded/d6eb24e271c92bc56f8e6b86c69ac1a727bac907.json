Revenues were up 4.3 per cent from US$40.68 billion in fiscal 2018 or 7 per cent in local currency.\n\n\u201cAs long as you continue to be in a continuous learning mindset, there is employment for you at PwC,\u201d Mr Moritz told Reuters.\n\nPwC and rivals EY, KPMG and Deloitte, dubbed the \u201cBig Four\u201d dominate auditing globally but are in the regulatory firing line in Britain.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe UK Financial Reporting Council said in July all four failed to hit its quality targets, with PwC singled out to join KPMG under tougher supervision.\n\n\u201cWe definitely acknowledge that we can be better,\u201d Mr Moritz said. PwC announced in June it will spend an extra \u00a330 million (S$51 million) to beef up its audit business in Britain by hiring an extra 500 auditors.\n\nThe sector is waiting to see how the British government will implement recommendations from the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to shake up the audit market.\n\nThe CMA proposed \u201cjoint audits\u201d, whereby a Big Four accountant must team up with a smaller rival to audit big listed companies in Britain in a bid to improve quality.\n\nIt also recommended splitting up audit and consultancy work into separate operational units, a step none of the Big Four has taken voluntarily, though some are boosting oversight of audit internally.\n\nDeloitte said this week it was looking at voluntary measures like temporary market share caps, and that it has raised these with the business ministry.\n\nMr Moritz said PwC will not offer market caps voluntarily.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s anti-competitive,\u201d Mr Moritz said.\n\nPwC audits 28 per cent of the top 100 listed companies in Britain, and a similar percentage of the next 250 listings, unchanged from 2018.\n\nMr Moritz said reform should instead focus on the gap between what investors want and what auditors can deliver, now being looked at by former London Stock Exchange chairman Donald Brydon, who is due to report back in December.\n\n\u201cAre we doing enough work in the going concern and fraud area? Are we doing enough work in the measures that drive value that may be not financial?\u201d Mr Moritz said.\n\n\u201cInvestors want forward looking information as much as they want backward looking information.\u201d\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - [LONDON] PwC earned US$42.4 billion in global annual revenues with US$3 billion going into bolstering skills over the next two years, the \u201cBig Four\u201d accountant said on Tuesday as it faces closer regulatory scrutiny in Britain. .
