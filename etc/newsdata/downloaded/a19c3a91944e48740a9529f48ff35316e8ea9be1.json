Customers who want to secure one of the first 500 'pioneer' examples with need to pay a reservation fee of \u20ac119,000 (\u00a3106,166).\n\nThe car, which has five square metres of solar panels on the roof and bonnet, is claimed to have a range of 725 kilometres (450 miles) from a full charge of the relatively small battery powering the vehicle.\n\nWith Department for Transport calculating that the average motorist covers 7,134 miles annually, it means Britons could drive all-year-round for free \u2013 granted the sun comes out for long enough to charge the One\u2019s battery.\n\nLightyears ahead? This is the Lightyear One - the world's first 'long-range' solar car that promises to cover 450 miles with a full battery\n\nAt the launch event in Katwijk, Holland, bosses revealed key pieces of information about the solar car that's due to be delivered to owners in 2021.\n\nThey said it can be charged directly from the sun, which can generate a maximum of 20,000km worth of free energy per year.\n\nBut it can also be charged from existing electric vehicle plug-in points while it's also boosting the batteries using its solar panels, effectively charging much faster than traditional EVs already on the market.\n\nAn overnight charge from a 230-volt socket will provide customers with 400km of range, around 250 miles.\n\nLex Hoefsloot, ceo and co-founder of Lightyear said the car 'represents a new era of driving'.\n\n'Two years of dreaming, thinking and working hard have led to this milestone, which is a giant leap towards achieving our mission of making clean mobility available to everyone.'\n\nLightyear was founded in 2016 by the Solar Team Eindhoven, which won the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\n\nThere are five square metres of solar panels fitted to the roof and bonnet of the One to collect energy from the sun providing up to 12,400 miles of free motoring each year\n\nThe solar cells are protected by safety glass that's so strong it can hold the weight of full-grown adult\n\nThe Dutch start up said it is already developing more cars and will focus attention on autonomous systems for the next models in its range\n\nDevelopment of the long-range solar One has received several awards, grants and support from key investors.\n\nJust 500 first-run 'pioneer' models will be made, though 100 of them have already been claimed by customers.\n\nEach one will cost \u20ac149,000 - so around \u00a3134,000 - or motorists can lease one for \u20ac1,879 (\u00a31,677) a month.\n\n'This allowed us to develop a working prototype for the first long-range solar car in just two years,' Hoefsloot added.\n\n'We have already sold over a hundred vehicles. With Lightyear One, we want to show that our technology enabled us to build one of the most sustainable cars on the market that also offers great convenience.'\n\nHoefsloot said the One would resolve the issue of range anxiety - the fear of running out of battery power in an electric car.\n\nBy overcoming this hurdle, he said the One will become the world's first 'ultra efficient' vehicle.\n\n'The main goal of the car is to fill in where electric cars fall short,' he continued.\n\n'Research has shown that range and the lack of charging options are still the top concerns that people have when considering electric cars.'\n\nThe Lightyear One was unveiled on Tuesday at the TheaterHangaar in Katwijk, the Netherlands\n\nThe Lightyear One can also also be charged from an existing electric-vehicle charge point to boost the batteries. This can be done at the same time as it collects energy from the sun, which would significantly reduce charging periods but would mean the car would need to be outside\n\nThe vehicle is made from high-tech lightweight composite materials and the body itself is super aerodynamic to reduce the impact of drag, which can reduce range\n\nLightyear says car itself is constructed from high-tech composite materials so that it is super light - to extend the range - but strong enough to withstand crash impacts and pass stringent safety regulations.\n\nThe design is super aerodynamic in a bid to reduce drag and, again, extended the range.\n\nThe small battery pack installed in the One powers the four driven wheels independently, so no energy is lost in transit from the engine to the wheel.\n\nThe roof and bonnet is made up of a combined five square meters of integrated solar cells in safety glass.\n\nThe Dutch car firm says construction of these is so strong that a fully-grown adult can walk on them without causing damage.\n\nIn addition to solar power, Lightyear One can be charged at a (fast) charging station or even a regular outlet, it added.\n\nHoefsloot said the One was the first in a range of models from the brand, which is also working on autonomous systems for its upcoming vehicles.\n\n'Since new technology has a high unit cost, we have to start in an exclusive market; Lightyear One is the first long-range solar car and has staggering specifications,' he continued.\n\n'The next models we plan to develop will have a lower purchase price. In addition, future models will be provided to autonomous and shared car fleets, so the purchase price can be divided amongst a large group of users.'\n\nThe cabin is minimalist a clutter-free dashboard. The standout feature is the iPad-size touchscreen\n\nThe fuss-free interior looks classy and stylish. Many of the cabin materials are recycled, including the wood insets in the centre console and door panels\n\nHe added: 'Combined with the low operating costs of the vehicle, we aim to provide premium mobility for a low price per kilometer.\n\n'A third, final step will be to provide truly sustainable cars that are more affordable to use than the cost of gas you need to drive a combustion car.\n\n'This will prove to be our most important tipping point in the near future, and it will pave the way for a car fleet that is one hundred percent sustainable.'\n\nLightyear claims to have already found buyers for 100 of the cars. A limited run of 500 will be special edition models\n\nWith Department for Transport calculating that the average motorist covers 7,134 miles annually, it means Britons could drive all-year-round for free \u2013 granted the sun comes out for long enough to charge the One\u2019s battery\n\nImages of the interior reveal a minimalist cabin with a clutter-free dashboard and hard-wearing recycled materials.\n\nThe central unit is dominated by an iPad-size touchscreen. This will house the infotainment system but also provide information about remaining charge and live updates for the volume of energy being collected from the sun.\n\nAnyone who wants to get their hands on a One will need to reserve one of the 400 cars that currently don't have a name on them. This can be done at the Lightyear website.\n\nProduction is due to be ramped up in 2021 at the firm's own facility in Helmond, just outside of Eidhoven.\n\nIt currently employs around 100 staff and in the last two years has raised over 20million euros from reservations, investments and grants.", "description": "Lightyear One can be charged directly from the sun thanks to the 5 square metres of solar cells on its roof and bonnet.
