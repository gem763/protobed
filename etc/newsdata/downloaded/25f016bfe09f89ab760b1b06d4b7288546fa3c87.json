We need to understand these accounts better.\u201d\n\nShe added the number was \u201cless than five\u201d and the time between discharge and readmission ranged from five to 55 days.\n\nIt is not yet clear what was responsible, with theories including a resumption of vaping, that the injury had left patients more susceptible to infectious disease, that steroid treatment had made them vulnerable to infection, or steroid treatment was halted too quickly.\n\nThe CDC recommended every patient return for outpatient follow-up within seven days.\n\nSchuchat told reporters nationwide research suggested products containing THC, particularly those obtained off the street or from unknown sources, were linked to most of the cases and play a major role in the outbreak.\n\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive component of cannabis and more than three-quarters of patients reported using it either exclusively or with nicotine products.\n\nNed Sharpless, the acting head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), reported that among samples tested of THC containing products, 47 percent contained Vitamin E acetate which is used as a cutting agent and is harmful when vaporized and inhaled.\n\nBut authorities cannot definitively exclude nicotine products, since 13 percent of all patients reported nicotine use only.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman later told AFP that because the information was self-reported, it was potentially unreliable.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, patients might not always know what substances they use or might be hesitant to reveal use of substances that are not legal in their state.\u201d\n\nFor now, investigators suspect that some portion of the cases are due to a risky practice linked to the preparation of THC, but cannot say for certain whether other cases have other causes innate to the vaping process.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Some patients who have been discharged from hospital after recovering from lung injury associated with vaping have had to be", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/00b54e_300-people-so-far-fallen-ill-all-hospitalized-rate-new-cases-showing-no-signs-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
