Apple has already addressed the issue in a new patch for iCloud on Windows. If you use (or have ever installed) iCloud or iTunes for Windows, you should make sure it\u2019s updated as soon as possible.\n\nWhy update it even if you don\u2019t use it? According to Morphisec, the research firm that initially found the exploit, Bonjour installs automatically when you install iTunes, but it doesn\u2019t automatically uninstall when you delete iTunes. If you\u2019ve installed iTunes, and then gotten rid of it, there\u2019s a good chance Bonjour is still there, ready to work with any compatible apps whether you have them or not.\n\nThough Apple has already addressed the exploit, the issue raises larger concerns for iPhone/iTunes users on Windows, long-term. Apple has killed off iTunes on Mac devices. With iTunes out of the spotlight, that may make the Windows app a more attractive target for bad actors. That isn\u2019t to say that these apps are unsafe or unprotected, it\u2019s just something to think about.", "description": "Windows iTunes users: There\u2019s a serious exploit in the Bonjour updater for Apple software on Windows that makes it possible for someone to discreetly install ransomware on your system....", "authors": ["Whitson Gordon", "Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/xuwnejrdopymfubdrilp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
