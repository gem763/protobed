Trump said the Turks needed to have a swath of Syria \u201ccleaned out\u201d after battling with Syrian Kurds there.\n\nTrump spoke after Turkey announced a five-day \u201cpause\u201d in fighting in Syria negotiated by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe deal was reached just over a week after Trump agreed in a phone call with Erdogan to pull out U.S. troops in Syria to cede the battlefield to the Turks, who have targeted America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Pence has termed the new deal a \u201cceasefire,\u201d but the Turkish foreign minister called it a \u201cpause,\u201d emphasizing: \u201cThis is not a ceasefire,\u201d and said that Turkish troops would not withdraw.\n\nEthnic cleansing, assisted and ratified by the president of the United States. https://t.co/vHreSyS4GG \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) October 17, 2019\n\nTurkey will pause its invasion for 120 hours to allow the Kurds to withdraw from a zone of the border region. But the agreement also allows Turkey to take over a significant swath of Syria and calls on Syrian Kurdish forces, known as the YPG, to surrender their heavy weapons. The deal would suspend U.S. economic sanctions against Turkey.\n\n\u201cFor many, many years, Turkey, in all fairness, they\u2019ve had a legitimate problem\u201d with northeast Syria, where the Kurds are settled, Trump said in remarks in Texas ahead of his rally in Dallas. \u201cThey had terrorists, they had a lot of people in there they couldn\u2019t have \u2026. and they had to have it cleaned out.\u201d (See the video above.)\n\nThe Kurds have battled ISIS for years alongside U.S. troops \u2014 and have fought against Turkey for centuries over disputed territory. Now that the ethnic group is under siege, the destabilization has \u201ccreated a perfect situation for ISIS to capitalize on,\u201d Rita Katz, executive director of the SITE Intelligence Group, a private firm that tracks online extremist activity, told The Washington Post.\n\nTrump said in Texas: \u201cI want to thank Turkey\u201d for agreeing to the pause in fighting \u2014 even though it was Turkey that launched the invasion. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten everything we\u2019ve ever dreamed of,\u201d Trump added. He said the Kurds are \u201cincredibly happy\u201d with the \u201csolution.\u201d\n\nTrump said the \u201cceasefire\u201d was something that Turkey had been after for 10 years.\n\n\u201cYou would have lost millions and millions of lives. They couldn\u2019t get it without a little \u2018rough love,\u2019 as I called it ... they needed a little bit of that at the beginning,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd then everybody said, \u2018Wow, this is tougher than we thought.\u2019 When those guns start shooting, they tend to do things.\u201d\n\nTrump called it a \u201cgreat day for the United States. It\u2019s a great day for Turkey ... The Kurds were great. Great day for the Kurds. It\u2019s really a great day for civilization.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday Trump said that the Kurdish allies were \u201cno angels\u201d and said that in some cases they represent a threat more dangerous than ISIS, whom the Kurds fought against with American troops in Syria. He stated that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria \u201chas nothing to do with us.\u201d\n\nThe House on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly, 354 to 60, to denounce the U.S. troop withdrawal in Syria; 129 Republicans joined all the Democrats in the vote on the resolution.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nRepublicans Rage At Trump's Syria Policy With Little To Show For It\n\nMulvaney Acknowledges Quid Pro Quo In Trump Ukraine Call, Says \u2018Get Over It\u2019\n\nTurkey Reaches Deal With U.S. To Temporarily Pause Syria Invasion\n\nLove HuffPost?
