Prosecutors from those offices, along with investigators from the Internal Revenue Service, have spoken with potential witnesses in recent months regarding alleged abuse and misconduct in Olympic sports organizations, including USA Gymnastics and USA Taekwondo.\n\nLarry Nassar is currently serving an effective life sentence for sexually assaulting women and girls, most of them under the guise of medical treatment.

Join the conversation below.\n\nSeparately, prosecutors in the Justice Department\u2019s public-integrity unit are investigating how several FBI offices handled reports of Nassar\u2019s abuse in 2015 and 2016, two people familiar with the investigation said. That investigation, which grew out of an inquiry by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office, has focused on former USA Gymnastics President Steve Penny and his dealings with FBI agents, the people said.\n\nMr. Penny is also under scrutiny in the investigation into the U.S. Olympic system, people familiar with the matter said. Until his resignation in 2017, Mr. Penny wielded enormous power over national-team gymnasts, in some cases serving as their agent in endorsement deals and organizing heavily sponsored post-Olympic tours, people familiar with his work said. People familiar with the matter said these arrangements were of interest to federal investigators, as are similar arrangements at other national governing bodies, through which governing-body executives could profit from their positions.\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Penny, Edith Matthai, said the only investigation her client is aware of is the inquiry into the FBI\u2019s handling of the case. \u201cHe has not personally received any money whatsoever from any source related to any endorsement or other promotional activity by an athlete or a member of an athlete\u2019s family,\u201d Ms. Matthai said, adding that any implication he had done so was \u201cflat out false and defamatory.\u201d\n\nThe FBI\u2019s National Press Office in Washington, D.C., referred requests for comment to the Justice Department and the Inspector General\u2019s office. The Inspector General\u2019s Office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Penny was forced out of USA Gymnastics in March 2017 amid mounting outrage over his handling of sexual-abuse cases, including a five-week delay\u2014 first reported by The Wall Street Journal\u2014in reporting gymnasts\u2019 concerns about Nassar to the FBI in the summer of 2015.\n\nThe gymnasts\u2019 allegations then languished for nearly a year in several FBI field offices. During that time, Mr. Penny emailed FBI agents seeking advice on how to contain the Nassar news and, in one case, offered to refer the FBI agent in charge of the Indianapolis field office for a job at the USOC. Mr. Penny was arrested in October 2018 on a state evidence-tampering charge in Texas, in connection with a Nassar-related investigation there. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nNassar was charged in late 2016 with state sexual-abuse and federal child-pornography counts, to which he later pleaded guilty. He is serving a life sentence in federal prison.\n\nUSA Gymnastics filed for bankruptcy in December, and the organization faces significant legal exposure: USA Gymnastics\u2019 lawyers have been responding to Justice Department subpoenas as recently as April, according to bankruptcy filings.\n\n\u201cUSA Gymnastics is striving to become an athlete-centric organization that keeps athlete safety and well-being at the forefront of everything it does,\u201d a spokeswoman for USA Gymnastics said in an email. \u201cUSA Gymnastics has cooperated fully with any government investigation and will continue to do so in the future.\u201d\n\nJustice Department investigators are also investigating USA Taekwondo, another sports governing body that has been hit with allegations of abuse, people familiar with the matter said. In a class-action lawsuit filed in Colorado last year, dozens of women alleged \u201cforced labor and services, sex trafficking, and other travesties inflicted upon America\u2019s Olympic hopeful taekwondo athletes\u201d by the USOPC, USA Taekwondo and SafeSport.\n\nThe three sports bodies have denied the allegations. SafeSport was dismissed from the case earlier this year.\n\nLawyers and a representative for USA Taekwondo didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn May, the Center for SafeSport, which opened in Colorado in 2017, received a grand-jury subpoena from federal prosecutors, seeking an array of information, including materials produced for congressional investigations and documentation of all sexual-abuse complaints the organization had received, a person familiar with the matter said. SafeSport has provided documents to investigators, the person said.\n\n\u2014Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Rebecca Davis O\u2019Brien at Rebecca.OBrien@wsj.com", "description": "The Justice Department is pursuing multiple criminal investigations into sexual abuse in U.S. Olympic sports organizations and into potential business misconduct throughout the U.S. Olympic system.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davis O Brien", "Rebecca.Obrien Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106914/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
