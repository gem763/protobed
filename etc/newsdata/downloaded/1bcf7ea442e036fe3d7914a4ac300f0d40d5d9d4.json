Brands appeal to so many use-cases and we figured the best way to figure it out is by trying it ourselves. So for the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been using CBD products at home in various ways to see what it had in store for me.\n\nMy favorite CBD product to-date has to be CBDistillery\u2019s CBD Salve. I knew the idea was to apply it onto sore muscles to help promote a faster recovery, but I\u2019m not great at post-workout recovery. I kept neglecting trying it out right up until I rolled my ankle on a run back from the gym a few mornings ago. Once I made it home, I got a teaspoon-worth of the salve on my finger and rubbed it into my ankle. There wasn\u2019t any smell and soon the salve was fully absorbed into my skin. By the time I was done showering, the pain of the injury had nearly dissipated. I\u2019m certainly not ready to say the salve alone made everything better, but my ankle did heal nicely within a day or so. If balm sounds like an alley you\u2019d like to walk, check out similar products like the Charlotte\u2019s Web Hemp Infused Balm and the new CBD balm sticks from Daughter of the Land \u2014 Scouted editor Jillian Lucas is a personal fan of the latter.\n\nAside from the balm, I\u2019ve been trying out the brand\u2019s CBD gummies, softgels, and tincture. I used all of them similarly. That is: after I\u2019d finished a day\u2019s work and before going to sleep. All of them certainly helped me relax and wind down. I never felt high or out of my head, always still fully capable and thinking clearly. I just felt more relaxed that I had before. It\u2019s not a huge wonder the final effect of these CBD products was similar \u2014 they\u2019re all made with CBD. Rather, I think the big difference to note among the various forms is the speed with which they trigger and the length of the effect. Below are my takeaways on each one and some other places to find similar products.\n\nCBD Night Time Gummies, $60 at CBDistillery: These are, in my opinion, the most accessible since they\u2019re delicious* and I\u2019m immediately tempted to keep popping them. Two of them are enough for a night\u2019s relaxation. For me, the effect kicked in around an hour after I ate them. Another great option is the CBD Gummies Jar from JustCBD.\n\nFull Spectrum CBD Infused Softgels, $60 at CBDistillery: These are fairly small as far as softgels go, so they slide down easily. And of all the products, these were the quickest to use (pop!) and most packable. If I were to travel and wanted to bring CBD along, the softgels would be perfect since taking them is speedy and they look like any other pill for those of us socially shy of CBD-ing in public still. They kicked in between an hour or two after I took them and lasted all night, helping to keep me in a deep sleep throughout. The Extra Strength CBDCapsules from Charlotte\u2019s Web are highly rated and another option to consider.\n\nPure CBD Oil (THC Free) Tincture, $55 at CBDistillery: The tincture is really meant to use in food or drinks but I applied it underneath my tongue, a totally fine way to use it but seemingly strange and I doubt I\u2019d ever do so in public. The tincture, a liquid that makes it into your system quickly, had me relaxed in less than 20 minutes. It\u2019s the fastest of the three and lasted as long as the softgels. I liked it for the absorption factor, keeping most of it out of my stomach and giving me the desired effects the fastest. Additionally, once I get into cooking with CBD, the tincture will be the best (and only) option. And again, the Extra Strength CBD Oil from Charlotte\u2019s Web is also highly rated and another option for you.\n\n*With respect to the gummy bear gods, I must advise these aren\u2019t as perfect as Haribo Gold Bears but nothing is so that\u2019s okay.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Scouted Newsletter Product recommendations that'll make your life better and tips to help you shop smarter.
