Brand-new poll from \"The Washington post,\" 58% support an impeachment inquiry and 49% actually support removing president trump from office. This all comes as a key witness is set to testify about the text messages he exchanged with fellow diplomats will Ukraine and president trump as congress grapples with how to secure testimony from the original whistle-blower without putting that whistle-blower in danger. Our senior congressional correspondent Mary Bruce tracking all the latest. Reporter: Good morning. As the president and some of his top allies here on the hill are demanding to know this person's identity, Democrats here on the hill are now considering going to extreme measures to protect the whistle-blower. This morning, Democrats are weighing every option to protect the whistle-blower who sparked this impeachment inquiry. Even considering obscuring the person's voice and appearance or questioning the whistle-blower at a remote location. He wants to know the identity of the whistle-blower, and so this extremely unusual situation unfortunately demands extreme measures in terms of protecting the security of the whistle-blower. Reporter: No date has been set to question the whistle-blower, but today congressional investigators will hear from a key witness to the president's push for Ukraine to investigate his rival Joe Biden. The ambassador to the eu, Gordon sondland, worked behind the scenes to help carry out trump's wishes in Ukraine, a country that isn't even in the eu. The ambassador even meeting with the Ukrainian president to give advice about how to navigate trump's demands and seeming to dangle a potential meeting with the president as leverage to get Ukraine to investigate. In text messages turned over to house investigators, sondland writes that the president really wants the deliverable before any meeting could be set. And when trump withheld $400 million in military aid to Ukraine, the top American diplomat there wrote to sondland that it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign. But sondland stood up for trump writing, the president has been crystal clear, no quid pro quos of any kind then adding, I suggest we stop the back and forth by text. The president is adamant he did nothing wrong. It's just a scam. This is a scam by the Democrats to try and win an election that they're not going to win in 20. Reporter: Republicans largely standing with the president, some suggesting trump was just joking when he said that China should also investigate Biden. But asked if that's true -- Mr. President, were you joking when you suggested China look into the Bidens? Reporter: The president wouldn't comment. Now, as this investigation deepens, Democrats have now subpoenaed the Pentagon and the white house budget office for documents related to trump's decision to withhold aid to Ukraine. George. The situation so extraordinary right now on capitol hill the whistle-blower needs these special protections because in part because of the threats from the president and his allies. Reporter: Yeah, George, this is just remarkable. Democrats here on the hill have a very real concern that their Republicans colleagues could try to out the whistle-blower and his or her identity including now considering these extreme measures like masking the person's appearance even possibly have staffers instead of lawmakers do the questioning. The president has a right to know his accuser -- the whistle-blower is, of course, protected by law from any retaliation, George.
