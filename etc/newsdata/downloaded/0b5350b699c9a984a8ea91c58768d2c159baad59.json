Ten-man Spurs gained a much-needed three points at home to Southampton last weekend and I think they will follow up at the Amex with the Seagulls continuing to struggle to create opportunities. Indeed, since the start of the 2017-18 season Brighton have failed to score in 34 Premier League games \u2013 more than any other club. I expect to see Spurs win a low-scoring affair. Tip: Spurs to win and under 2.5 goals\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nBurnley v Everton Striker Chris Wood has scored three times in the last couple of league games for Burnley having drawn a blank in his previous nine. I believe the Clarets will have their opportunities against an Everton side who have lost their last three league games and have picked up just one point on their travels so far this season. The Blues did have eight shots on target against Manchester City last weekend \u2013 the most the champions have faced since November 2015, but I believe things are likely to get worse before they get better for Marco Silva\u2019s side at Turf Moor. Tip: Burnley to win and both teams to score\n\nLiverpool v Leicester City Brendan Rodgers returns to Anfield for the first time since he left Liverpool back in 2015. The Foxes\u2019 boss will take heart from the fact that it was Leicester who were the last Premier League side to stop the Reds on home soil courtesy of a 1-1 draw back in January on a snowy evening on Merseyside. Since that night Liverpool have won their last 10 home league games scoring 33 times in the process and I believe Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side will gain a 17th successive league win although I expect the Foxes\u2019 to play their part in, what promises to be, a terrific game between two inform sides. Tip: Liverpool to win and both teams to score\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nNorwich City v Aston Villa Two of the newly promoted sides go head-to-head at Carrow Road. I am struggling to split the sides and expect to see an entertaining low-scoring draw. Villa were pegged back twice at home to Burnley at Villa Park last weekend and they have now scored twice in their last couple of league games but picked up just one solitary point. They will need to improve defensively against a Norwich side who have lost their last couple of games without scoring on the road, since they famously beat the champions in their last home game. Tip: Game to finish in a draw\n\nWatford v Sheffield United Watford are without a win in their last 11 league games and they have already conceded 20 league goals so far this term in just seven matches. These are worrying times for the Hornets who meet a Sheffield United side unbeaten away from home so far this term. I don\u2019t expect to see many opportunities at Vicarage Road, and this is another game that I am having difficulty splitting the teams. Tip: Game to finish 1-1\n\nWest Ham United v Crystal Palace West Ham remain unbeaten in the league since their opening day mauling at the hands of Manchester City. I expect them to have too many guns in this London derby for a Palace side who saw Wilfried Zaha back to his very best in their win over Norwich at Selhurst Park last weekend. Tip: West Ham to win\n\nArsenal v Bournemouth Arsenal were good value for their point at Old Trafford on Monday and I expect them to brush aside the challenge of Bournemouth back at the Emirates on Sunday. The Gunners only defeat so far this season came at Anfield although they must improve defensively if they are to return to the Champions League automatically at the end of the season. Tip: Arsenal to win and both teams to score\n\nManchester City v Wolves Wolves gained a much-needed first league win of the season at home to Watford last weekend, but they are likely to find the champions a very different proposition at the Etihad on Sunday. Kevin De Bruyne picked up a groin injury at Goodison at the weekend and, at the time of writing, it is uncertain if the midfielder will be available for the visit of Wolves. One thing is for sure Pep Guardiola will not be gambling on the fitness of the Belgian midfielder who has been sensational so far this term. Tip: City -2\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nSouthampton v Chelsea Southampton will feel they missed a decent opportunity at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last weekend given the hosts played the majority of the game with 10-men. The Saints have struggled for points at St Mary\u2019s so far this season and I think Chelsea will edge what promises to be a terrific game. Frank Lampard\u2019s side scored five at Wolves in their last league game on the road and I expect his young side to continue to go from strength-to-strength this season. Tip: Chelsea to win and both teams to score\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nNewcastle United v Manchester United Newcastle failed to have a shot on target in their 5-0 drubbing at the King Power on Sunday although they did play much of the game with 10-men following the red card given to Isaac Hayden. The Magpies are struggling to create opportunities, but I think they will get a draw against Manchester United in what promises to be a nervous, edgy St James\u2019 Park on Sunday. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s side did get a draw at home to Arsenal earlier in the week and there was no lack of effort from the hosts, but they lack the quality that you associate with the club and these are worrying times, arguably, for both these famous clubs.
