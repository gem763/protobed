Bioglitter biodegrades in freshwater after 28 days,\" according to the product's founder Stephen Cotton.\n\nShambala festival in the UK will only be selling Bioglitter this year.\n\n\"Sorry glitter junkies, we have to accept that microplastics on our land or in waterways is a problem. If you're dead set on facial decoration, we recommend cracking out the face paints or even making a mask,\" festival organizers said in a statement.\n\nFestivalgoers are pictured wearing Bioglitter.\n\nTake the bus\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions are another big problem for the festival industry.\n\nOn average a festival produces 500 tons, the weight of three single-story houses, of carbon dioxide emissions and a festival goer generates 5 kg of CO2 per day, according to A Greener Festival's latest report , which analyzes data provided by festivals in 17 countries.\n\nThe UK festival industry uses 5 million liters of fuel annually and emits nearly 20,000 tons of carbon dioxide, with transport accounting for over 80% of total emissions, according to Bethan Riach, a spokesperson for Powerful Thinking.\n\nRiach told CNN that there are several easy ways for festival-goers to lower their carbon footprint.\n\nTraveling to the event by public transport can drastically slash emissions, she said, adding that many festivals offer discounted coach and entry tickets.\n\nIf you have to travel by car, team up with other festival-goers and fill your car with new friends. \"Try Liftshare, Blablacar or GoCarShare. Got a lot of friends? Consider hiring a minibus to get your crew there in style,\" Riach said.", "description": "Four easy ways you can enjoy a music festival this summer without trashing the planet.", "authors": ["Isabelle Gerretsen"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190523160015-glastonbury-festival-trash-1-super-tease.jpg"}
