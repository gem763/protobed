They were just trying to get back to their hotel.\u2019\n\nShe said it\u2019s likely the family will be formally deported but no paperwork has yet been shared with them or their lawyers.\n\nThe family members were arrested and taken into custody near the US-Vancouver border and were told they would be released to family in the US the following day.\n\nInstead, according to Eileen Connors\u2019 statement, immigration officials said there was a change in plans and the family were put in a van and driven to the airport.\n\nEileen said it was \u2018like an abduction or kidnapping\u2019.\n\nDavid Connors and his brother Michael have been kept separately to their wives and children\n\nEileen Connors said being flown to Pennsylvania was \u2018like a kidnapping\u2019\n\nIn her written statement obtained by The Philadelphia Inquirer, she said: \u2018We will be traumatized for the rest of our lives by what the United States government has done to us.\u2019\n\nThe family were flown from Seattle airport to Pennsylvania and arrived at the detention center on 5 October, where they remain.\n\nBerks is one of three detention centers for migrant families in the US, the other two being in Texas near the Mexico border.\n\nAccording to the family, Michael and David have been separated from their wives and children and are being kept in a different part of the centre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Eileen\u2019s statement she said her son was stripped naked and exposed with his clothes and blankets taken for washing.\n\nShe wrote: \u2018When I ask how am I supposed to keep my baby warm in this horrible cold, all they tell me is to put a hat on him.\n\n\u2018They even took away one of his formula containers, which I had to beg for three days for them to return to me.\u2019\n\nThe couple are being held at an immigration detention centre in Pennsylvania (Picture: ICE)\n\nEileen wrote that the blankets and sheets they were given \u2018smelled like a dead dog\u2019 and the conditions they are kept in are squalid.\n\nShe said she won\u2019t use them to cover her son \u2018for fear they haven\u2019t been washed and my baby will become sick\u2019.\n\nShe added that the bathrooms are dirty and broken and at night a staff shines flashlights into their cell every 15 minutes.\n\nEileen said: \u2018I feel like someone is going to take my baby.\u2019\n\nShe added they have been \u2018treated like criminals\u2019 adding: \u2018This would never happen in the United Kingdom to US citizens, or anyone else, because people there are treated with dignity.\u2019\n\nUS officials deny Eileen\u2019s claims of poor treatment and said: \u2018Eileen Connors and David Connors are currently in ICE custody at the Berks Family Residential Center (BFRC).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018BFRC provides a safe and humane environment for families as they go through the immigration process.\n\n\u2018BFRC supports all sanctioned local, state, and federal investigations into the safety and welfare of our residents.\n\n\u2018Reporters of abuse or inhumane conditions at BFRC are unequivocally false.\u2019\n\nThe family\u2019s lawyer told US reporters she had no information on the charges against them.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
