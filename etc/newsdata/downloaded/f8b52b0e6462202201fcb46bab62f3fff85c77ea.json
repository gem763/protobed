And while there\u2019s plenty of good stuff on offer now, we really didn\u2019t know how good we had it back then.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust look at the charts from this exact week in 2009: Cheryl is at the top with Fight For This Love; then the fastest-selling track of the year. The soldier imagery! The choreography! The X Factor performance! Truly a pop culture moment from a star at the height of her powers.\n\nBelow her at No2 is Alexandra Burke, Chez\u2019s own former X Factor protegee, with her almighty post-Hallelujah banger Bad Boys; while Whitney Houston\u2019s in the Top 5 for the final time in her lifetime with Million Dollar Bill, and Jay-Z and Alicia Keys\u2019 Empire State Of Mind is becoming a mainstay of the Top 10.\n\nAnd crikey, there\u2019s so much to come in the weeks that follow, before 2009 becomes 2010. Lady Gaga\u2019s masterpiece Bad Romance will top off her flawless breakthrough year by completing a seven-week journey to No1, Kesha will grace us for the first time with Tik Tok, Miley Cyrus will release her best-loved song in Party In The USA, and Britney Spears will do her bit for threesomes on the absolutely wild 3.\n\nOn top of all that, JLS will score their second number one of the year with Everybody In Love, Sugababes\u2019 final line-up will release their first single (About A Girl \u2013 underrated to this day!), Jason Derulo will make his UK breakthrough with Whatcha Say, and Rihanna will begin one of her most interesting eras with Russian Roulette.\n\nThat number of solid-gold anthems is about equal to the amount we\u2019ve had across the entirety of 2019, but it only covers the last two months of 2009. And there were plenty more across the year before that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s happened? Has pop died a death since, or have those of us looking forlornly backwards just reached a certain age when the newer stuff doesn\u2019t appeal so much?\n\nWell, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little of both.\n\nFor a start, the world is a hellfire now. In 2009, it\u2026 well, it wasn\u2019t a utopia, but lots of us were certainly a great deal more na\u00efve and care-free, and these especially exciting hits were there to soundtrack formative moments in our lives.\n\nPlus, the music back then was just\u2026 more inventive. Bolder. After a huge boom in mid-00s indie, pop was resurging in spectacular fashion.\n\nThat year had Mariah Carey shading Eminem through the medium of bops (Obsessed? Still a classic), Taylor Swift earning her first British hit, Beyonce continuing her Sasha Fierce era with Halo and Sweet Dreams, and Lily Allen releasing her exceptional It\u2019s Not Me, It\u2019s You album \u2013 complete with her best-ever tune, The Fear.\n\nKelly Clarkson nailed her only UK number one with My Life Would Suck Without You, a strong contender for my all-time favourite song; Girls Aloud released their final pre-hiatus single in the fan-favourite Untouchable; and Paloma Faith, La Roux, Florence + The Machine and Little Boots all made strong arrivals.\n\nPixie Lott, meanwhile, released a teen-pop debut album I was so shamelessly into that its lyrics inspired about four angsty Facebook statuses a week.\n\nRemember Jordin Sparks\u2019s Battlefield? David Guetta and Kelly Rowland\u2019s When Love Takes Over? Dizzee Rascal\u2019s Bonkers? The Saturdays\u2019 Issues? Agnes\u2019s Release Me? Cascada\u2019s Evacuate The Dancefloor? Two thousand and nine, friends! Two thousand and nine! The list is just endless!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not that everything\u2019s dirge now, it\u2019s just that the streaming era has made it less creative, and the charts a bit staler. While it\u2019s true that the genre has always been accused of being cynical and manufactured, it\u2019s hard not to agree at a time when everything feels geared to algorithms and in-house Spotify playlists.\n\nIt\u2019s nigh-on impossible now to get new acts on the mainstream radar without either going viral or spending loads of cash on warm-up singles that won\u2019t even chart. And though things have felt a little fresher in 2019 than they did last year, it\u2019s harder than ever to get the good stuff the success it deserves.\n\nLook at Normani\u2019s Motivation, for example, which has done incredibly well to spend 10 weeks in the UK Top 40, but still hasn\u2019t gone any higher than No27.\n\nLizzo, whose Truth Hurts took two years to get to No1 in the US, still hasn\u2019t hit the Top 10 over here with any song (though, for what it\u2019s worth, that is expected to finally change next week). Unless your surname is Capaldi, Sheeran or Grande, the struggle is real.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a wistful grandad, everything was simpler 10 years ago: more bangers, more boundary-nudging popstars, more all-round innocence. It\u2019s hard to imagine teens now looking back on 2k19 with the same affection \u2013 but time, I suppose, will tell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Motivation proves Normani will be an icon, just like Beyonc\u00e9 and JLo\n\nMORE: R Kelly ordered to use music royalties to pay mounting child support bills amid #MuteRKelly movement\n\nMORE: Love Island\u2019s Jourdan Riane breaks silence on Danny Williams split: \u2018I won\u2019t tolerate dishonesty\u2019", "description": "Remember Jordin Sparks's Battlefield?
