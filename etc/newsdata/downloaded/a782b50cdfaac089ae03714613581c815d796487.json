But since losing almost nine stone, her confidence has transformed (pictured, right in September 2019)\n\nDanielle could not even vacuum the stairs at work without getting out of breath and decided to take action when she had a health scare after a holiday in Tenerife.\n\nShe said: 'I came home from a holiday in Tenerife and had chest pains and the doctors said it was connected to my weight.'\n\nDoctors put her chest pains down to her weight and lifestyle, so Danielle ditched the takeaways, sweets and fizzy pop that she would gorge on before.\n\nShe explained: 'All the food and booze on holiday wouldn't have helped.\n\nDanielle tipped the scales at 21st 5lbs and was a size 26 at her heaviest two years ago (picuted in May 2017)\n\nDanielle said she had very little confidence before her weight loss, and would binge on chocolate and fizzy pop (pictured in December 2016)\n\n'I used to work in bars and would drink full fat fizzy pop, eat crisps, chocolate and peanuts.\n\nShe added: 'I was so bad, I would just eat convenience food that was handy.\n\n'I couldn't even hoover the stairs, I would get out of breath and all the girls at work would laugh at me that I was so unfit.'\n\nShe said: 'I had a few family weddings and I was a bridesmaid for my dad at his. I didn't want to be the fat bridesmaid at his wedding, I wanted to be more confident.'\n\nAfter her father asked her to be a bridesmaid at his wedding, she said she was determined not to be 'the fat one', and started her weight loss journey (pictured at her heaviest in April 2017)\n\nDuring a holiday to Marbella, Danielle started to have chest pains, and said she grew concerned about how her weight was affecting her health\n\nShe joined Slimming World in April 2017, and has since lost nine stone, dropping her weight to a healthy 13st 1lb.\n\nShe revealed: 'I had lost seven stone in time for my dad's wedding. I lost 10lbs in the last two weeks before the wedding and the dress fit me perfectly.\n\n'It was such a good feeling. Family I hadn't seen for a long time were all complimenting me.\n\n'It was really good to know they could see a positive change in me.'\n\nDanielle's diet before Breakfast: Latte, and gingerbread muffin Lunch: Baked potato with butter and coleslaw, heaps of filling. Two packets of crisps, a packet of haribo and two tins of coca cola Dinner: Pizza, chips, takeaway, convenience meals\n\nDanielle's diet after Breakfast: Weetabix and milked or low calorie cooked breakfast Lunch: Soup or baked potato with Cajun chicken, cheese and beans and a can of diet coke Dinner: Home made pizza, pasta dishes\n\nShe explained: 'My brother was crying as I walked down the aisle, he knew it meant so much to me. He was like my personal trainer.'\n\nDanielle said she became shy and would avoid going out in public over concerns what people might think of her.\n\nShe would wear big t-shirts in the pool on holiday and hide under baggy clothes.\n\nBut now a comfortable size 14, she is much more confident - and even wore a bikini for the first time ever on holiday in Marbella last summer.\n\nDanielle lost a total of seven stone ahead of her father's wedding, when she was a bridesmaid (pictured with her boyfriend Stuart Miele on the big day)\n\nDanielle managed to drop almost nine stone after swapping takeaways and junk food for homemade food (pictured, left in March 2019 and right in June 2019)\n\nDanielle went on to lose almost nine stone, and said she has never felt more confident (pictured in May 2019)\n\nShe has even lost two more stone since her dad's wedding in July last year, saying: 'I feel a lot better now, I feel loads more confident.'\n\nShe revealed: 'I was shy, I used to put off going out in public. I was always worried about what people thought. I hated the thought of seeing people.\n\n'Now I just don't really care. I wear skinny jeans, jump suits and swim suits that I would never wear before.'\n\n'Now I cook everything from scratch and I know what it in my food.'\n\nThe super slimmer says she now has the confidence to wear 'whatever' she likes, and said she always forgets how she looked before her weight loss\n\nThe 27-year-old shed almost nine stone and is now a healthy size 14 having ditched takeaways and junk food (pictured in September 2019)\n\nShe now cooks all her food from scratch and runs at least 5km twice a week as part of a running club.\n\nShe said: 'My Slimming World lady is amazing. She's great, she's always there when I want to chat and she's so supportive.'\n\nShe added: 'I just can't believe I have lost so much weight, I always forget I looked like that.\n\n'It wasn't easy, but I was really determined. When you have something in your head, you have to do it for yourself.'", "description": "Danielle Richmond, 27, from Moray, Scotland, tipped the scales at  21st 5lb two years ago.
