Busy people scurrying along cluttered pavements while seething commuters honk their horns in standstill traffic; it doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.\n\nFor a calmer experience, a walker would do well to direct their attention at the surrounding buildings. They don\u2019t move, for one, and some of them are truly extraordinary sights to behold.\n\nThe capital has long served as a canvas for pioneering architects from all over the world and as such is home to all manner of bold buildings from art deco cinemas to brutalist estates to the modern-day glass monoliths.\n\nThis does, however, mean that there are more buildings than one could hope to see in a lifetime. Lucky then that An Opinionated Guide to London Architecture, a new photo book from Hoxton Mini Press, presents a concise selection of the ones worth seeing.\n\nIt serves as a tour guide, with three different routes to follow that take in more than 50 of the capital\u2019s best buildings.\n\nAs the title suggests, the book is a subjective guide to London\u2019s buildings: the work of editors Sujata Burman and Rosa Bertoli, a pair of self-proclaimed design fantatics.\n\nWhile concise, it\u2019s hardly a narrow selection. The obligatory St Paul\u2019s Cathedral sits alongside modern classics such as the Walkie Talkie and plenty of lesser-known gems (the largest traditional Hindu temple outside of India, for example).\n\nAnd for those who can\u2019t face the fuss of trawling through London in person: it is all right there on the page.\n\n\u2018An Opinionated Guide to London Architecture\u2019 is available now from Hoxton Mini Press", "description": "Walking through London can be a frustrating experience.
