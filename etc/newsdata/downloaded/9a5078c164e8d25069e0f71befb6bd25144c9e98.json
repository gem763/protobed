Not about the Joker, though.\n\nThe Army is concerned about Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s \u201cJoker,\u201d which is due to hit movie theaters next Friday, and the \u201cdisturbing and very specific chatter\u201d online that was discovered recently.\n\nAs colleague Andrew Blake reported this week, \u201cA memo issued this week to Army personnel stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, said that the base\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division (CID) received intelligence about a \u2018credible potential mass shooting to occur at an unknown movie theater during the release of the new Joker movie scheduled on October 4, 2019.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat would Victor Hugo say? What would he do? Would he ask theaters not to screen \u201cJoker?\u201d\n\nNo one can answer with certainty.\n\nWhy would he concern himself?\n\nWell, Hugo was a prolific 19th century writer. He penned not only \u201cLes Miserables\u201d but also \u201cL\u2019Homme Qui Rit,\u201d or what the global world of stage, screen and music has redubbed as the \u201cThe Laughing Man\u201d or \u201cThe Grinning Man\u201d \u2014 which all centered on characterizations of a man with a disfigured face that appeared as a perpetual, grotesque grin.\n\nJack Nicholson\u2019s 1989 version was supremely comedic, opposite Michael Keaton\u2019s Batman, er, Bruce Wayne.\n\nCesar Romero\u2019s was as campy as campy could get in trying to outwit Adam West\u2019s Batman in the over-the-top TV series of the 1960s.\n\nHeath Ledger\u2019s acting in 2005\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d brought to light the darker sides of the Joker and the darkest sides of humanity \u2014 perhaps even beyond those of Hugo\u2019s era.\n\nIt was during a screening of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d in July 2012 in Aurora, Colorado, that a man dressed in tactical clothing set off tear gas grenades and shot into the audience using multiple firearms. James Eagan Holmes fatally shot 12 people and wounded 70 others.\n\nAt his home, investigators found a Batman mask.\n\nHolmes, who is now 31, was sentenced to 12 life sentences without parole and a maximum 3,318 additional years on attempted murder and explosives possession convictions.\n\nWhile the fictional DC Comics and Marvel Comics characters are considered superheroes \u2014 and we love to cheer them on \u2014 they, too, have dark sides that arguably could be considered mental derangement. Holmes\u2019 dad argued that his son was mentally ill.\n\nWhenever such mass shootings occur \u2014 whether at a gay nightclub, a movie theater, a school or an office building \u2014 mental illness is cited as a motive and/or defense.\n\nAnd, understandably, judges are fond of allowing jurors to accept testimony that speaks to what someone was thinking or believing.\n\nMuch boils down to free will. The free will to view a movie or not. The free will to deny your children the right to watch the superheroes and the supervillains or not.\n\nThe free will to petition Warner Bros. and movie theaters to not screen \u201cJoker.\u201d\n\nThe free will to screen \u201cJoker.\u201d\n\nI cannot imagine that \u201cJoker\u201d is going to be a blockbuster or big-time award winner for Joaquin Phoenix, who gave us a convincing Johnny Cash in \u201cWalk the Line.\u201d\n\nBut getting into the twisted mind of the Joker character, I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nBesides, who could believe the Joker has a love interest? Those who cannot separate romantic (Victor Hugo) characters from fictional comic book characters.\n\n\u2981 Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
