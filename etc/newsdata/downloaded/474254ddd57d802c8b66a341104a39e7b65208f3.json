(Jenni Evans, News24)\n\nThe court heard the complainant in the case was Stewart Bailey who SowetanLive reported was a former manager at the Harbour House group which owns the trendy Grand Caf\u00e9 Africa in Granger Bay.\n\nThe case is centred around a claim that in November 2017, Radley Dijkers, the brand manager, was allegedly pressured into making a payment to make sure there would be no disruptions at an upcoming event.\n\nThe money was allegedly paid to a former co-accused in the case, Carl Lakay, the court heard. Lakay was killed in August 2018.\n\nThe late advocate Pete Mihalik also got a mention during the trial when it emerged he was going to be instructed by Hendricks to represent Booysen. Mihalik could not go ahead because of an alleged \"averment\" Kinnear had made against him, which might have caused a conflict of interest.\n\nREAD: Mihalik murder: Three to go on trial in High Court\n\nMihalik was killed during a school run in late 2018.\n\nThe court also heard security providers were usually paid in advance but in the case of the event in November 2017, invoicing was only done in December after Kinnear eventually opened a docket.\n\nHendricks listed the names of police officers who Booysen alleged are part of the \"Cape Capture\" of the police by businessmen, including his apparent rival, Mark Lifman.\n\nKinnear said he did not know anything about that, adding when he visited Lifman's house it was for police matters.\n\nHe spent the day being repeatedly questioned over why he had not immediately opened a case docket when the extortion allegations were brought to his attention by Japhta, why he battled to get witnesses, and why he had not subpoenaed witnesses who refused to speak to him.\n\nKinnear said he started with an inquiry on purpose, because if he had opened a case docket at that stage he would have had to scan any early affidavits he received into the police's computerised case docket system.\n\nThis would have made it vulnerable to prying eyes who could pass the information on to the wrong people, he added.\n\n\"If you open a case, it becomes visible to everybody,\" explained Kinnear, to the apparent surprise of the lawyers present.\n\nHe said Bailey had said, in the copy of his affidavit, that Dijkers told him he was warned that if they did not pay up, people would arrive at the event and disrupt it.\n\nKinnear added he also wanted to find out whether Bailey and Dijkers would corroborate each other before he opened a docket, and discussed it with the National Prosecuting Authority.\n\nHe eventually opened a docket but could not get people to speak to him about these claims.\n\nHe said although he did not invite Dijkers to speak to him, he was later informed by Japtha that he was waiting for him in a boardroom at work.\n\nHowever, Dijkers did not say anything about being threatened.\n\nKinnear said as for the other witnesses he wanted to interview, they either told him via WhatsApp that they would not be available, or if somebody heard it was him on the phone, they did not want to speak to him.\n\nAsked what had happened to the R90 000 that the restaurant allegedly handed over, he said nobody knew because Lakay, who had supposedly fetched the money, was killed.\n\nKinnear had trouble getting the original of the Bailey affidavit, even calling Japhta this week to ask about it again but she was apparently off work and could not help him.\n\nDuring the trial, armed police officers sat near the doors, and anybody entering the court was searched twice.\n\nPurses and cigarette boxes were opened, ankles were patted, and even those who brought food or fruit along were told to go outside and get rid of it.\n\nThe State rested its case on Thursday and straight afterwards, Modack's lawyer, Dirk Uys, indicated he intended bringing an application to have the case dismissed.", "description": "The \"Cape Capture\" of certain police officers is behind a plethora of charges against two of the four men accused in a club security extortion case, the Cape Town Regional Court has heard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9435/7377f810a5a04c61995c88857fc90ea8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
