He spends $1,500 a month to market it online, and enlisted third-party delivery services like Seamless and Grubhub to deliver the burgers to customers.\n\n\"I'm utilizing the kitchens I already have to increase revenue without diminishing my other business,\" Dry told FOX Business.\n\nThe third-party delivery services take between 20 and 30% of his costs to deliver food, but Dry said since he's not paying for extra rent or staff, he can afford to do it. He said he makes between $500 to $1,000 a week just on Ghost Burger delivery and churns out around 10 orders per day.\n\nMore restaurant owners like Dry are using delivery-only models to reduce overhead costs like employment and rent as an affordable way to grow a business as more eaters rely on food ordering apps to get meals on-demand.\n\nHalal Guys, the New York City-based food cart turned national franchise known for its chicken gyros, beef and rice platters, wanted to expand its delivery reach to become more accessible to eaters outside of major cities. So it teamed up with third-party delivery service DoorDash to start cooking and delivering food out of the delivery app's new virtual kitchen, a shared space where chefs can cook and prepare their food and have it delivered. The hub, called DoorDash Kitchens, also features eateries like Thai chicken shop Rooster & Rice, diner chain Nation\u2019s Giant Hamburgers and ice cream shop Humphry Slocombe operating in Redwood California offering delivery or pick-up in 13 suburban markets in the Bay Area outside of San Francisco.\n\n\u201cWe still want to have the restaurants, but we wanted to reach more customers,\u201d Ahmed Abouelenein, the CEO of Halal Guys, said.\n\nAbouelenein said 30% of the Halal Guys business is delivery. So downsizing to a virtual kitchen made sense. He said the kitchen can serve up to 350 customers a day.\n\nCHAMPAGNE WITH THAT CHEESEBURGER? SPARKLING WINE BARS MIX THE EXOTIC WITH THE EVERYDAY\n\nSixty percent of consumers used a third-party delivery service such as DoorDash or Grubhub for delivery orders, according to a survey from the National Restaurant Association and market research firm Technomic Inc. And the demand has motivated restaurateurs to ramp up their delivery efforts without having to shell out thousands of dollars in real estate, permits, and staffing costs. The average cost of leasing a restaurant space in the U.S. is $495,000 a year, or $735,000 to buy, according to a 2018 survey from Smallbiztrends.com.\n\nAfter establishing a customer base at its brick-and-mortar restaurant Rooster & Rice in San Francisco, chief financial officer Min Park said having a ghost kitchen to deliver food was a way to scale the business to suburbs in the Bay Area. He estimates it will make up 25% of the business at a fraction of the cost since the ghost kitchen requires 70% less staffing. Some days, delivery orders have surpassed the number of orders out of the San Francisco-based restaurant\u2019s brick-and-mortar locations, Park said.\n\n\u201cSan Francisco is one of the most challenging places in the entire country to open a restaurant. If you have a full service or fast-casual restaurant, you need to have 'X' amount of front of house staff and 'X' amount of people working in back of house. Right now, it\u2019s just a kitchen where we get the order, make sure it\u2019s made right and distribute it,\u201d Park said.\n\nConsumers spent $10.2 billion on delivery services in 2018, that\u2019s up 42% from the year before, according to data from management consulting company Technomic. The trend toward better quality food delivered at an affordable cost started around the recession, restaurant consultants say, when diners lost disposable income to spend on eating out.\n\n\"During the recession, fine dining restaurants started to shutter and fast-casual began to thrive with providing good quality food for an affordable price,\" restaurant consultant Jason Kaplan said. \"People's palates have definitely become more developed within the past 20 years.\"\n\nA number of companies have been opening ghost kitchens. Kitchen United allows chains or restaurants to expand their outreach without having to sign a lease and hire new staff. Then there\u2019s CloudKitchens founded by Travis Kalanick, the co-founder of ride-hailing app Uber.\n\nThe challenge of going straight to a delivery-only model is building a customer base. Celebrity chef David Chang's delivery-only restaurant Ando shuttered just two years after it launched in 2016. And Maple, another delivery-only venture Chang invested in, also shut down in 2018.\n\n\"It's really hard to start a brand without a brick and mortar,\" Dry said, of being hesitant to invest in a ghost kitchen model outside of his own restaurants. He said the plan is to scale Ghost Burger's delivery business first, and then have a retail presence.\n\nUBER EATS TEST DRIVES THIS NEW FOOD REVENUE STREAM\n\nStill, virtual restaurants may help small business owners streamline delivery costs. Many restaurants use multiple third-party delivery services and must pay commission fees to each, sometimes between 20 to 30% of the total order cost. Kaplan said its more for marketing than boosting bottom lines.\n\n\"Small business owners aren't doing it for the margins, they're doing it because they hope it will put them out there and bring in more people to the restaurant,\" Kaplan said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Ghost kitchens run by these popular restaurants are delivering food to the masses.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Business-food-v4.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
