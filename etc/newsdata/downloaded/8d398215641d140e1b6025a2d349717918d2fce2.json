Since then, however, President Donald Trump has given mixed messages on whether he might support legislation expanding background checks.\n\nMcConnell, who as majority leader decides what legislation comes to the Senate floor for consideration, did not directly respond to a reporter\u2019s question on whether he personally supports expanded background checks.", "description": "The Republican leader of the U.S. Senate repeated on Tuesday that he would not commit to bringing gun control legislation up for consideration until the White House comes forward with its own proposal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428482474&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8928D", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
