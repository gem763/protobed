council, to strengthen their collective political voice.\n\nThe Kayap\u00f3s invited representatives of the Panara people to the meeting, despite the two groups having fought violently in the past.\n\nThe Kayap\u00f3s notably massacred the Panaras in 1968, during a fight in which they used firearms despite the latter tribe being armed only with arrows.\n\n\u201cWe killed the Kayap\u00f3, the Kayap\u00f3 killed us...but we didn\u2019t know what was happening....we didn\u2019t know about that [white] threat yet,\u201d said Sinku Panara, one of the Panara leaders.\n\n\u201cThen we cool
