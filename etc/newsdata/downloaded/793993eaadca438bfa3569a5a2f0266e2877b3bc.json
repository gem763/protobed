The Giuliani team saw U.S. Ambassador Yovanovitch as an obstacle to their objectives \u2014 digging up derogatory information on former vice president Biden and smoothing the way for a possible natural gas deal in Ukraine, former officials said.\n\n\"[Lutsenko's] incentive to help was to take out the ambassador,\" said a former senior diplomat with experience in the region. \"He was angry at criticism from the U.S. embassy over the slow pace of reform in the justice sector.\"\n\n\"There was this personal payback dimension.\"\n\nLutsenko could not be reached for comment.\n\nLutsenko's name had surfaced in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump even before the indictment against Fruman and Parnas was unsealed. In his July call with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy, Trump praised Lutsenko and lamented that he was on his way out.\n\n\"I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair,\" Trump said in the call. \"A lot of people are talking about that.\"\n\nLutsenko told NBC News last month that he's known Giuliani for \"many years\" and met with him while vacationing in New York.\n\nLutsenko said he counted Giuliani as a friend and has spoken to him \"maybe 10 times.\"\n\nLutsenko said they discussed former Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter, and talked \"about our system, about some of our law enforcement divisions and possibilities to cooperate.\"\n\nIn the indictment unsealed Thursday, federal prosecutors accused Parnas and Fruman of funneling foreign money to U.S. politicians in violation of federal campaign finance laws.\n\nThe indictment said Parnas and Fruman enlisted the help of a congressman in their effort to force out Yovanovitch.\n\nMultiple senior U.S. law enforcement officials told NBC News that the \"Congressman-1\" referenced in the indictment is former Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas. The two men committed to raising $20,000 for the then-lawmaker, the indictment alleged.\n\nSessions said Friday that he would return any campaign donations from Parnas and Fruman.\n\nDan De Luce reported from Washington.", "description": "Lutsenko is the Ukrainian official who prosecutors say urged 2 Giuliani associates to push for the ouster of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4225264/1000x563_nbc-191011-yuri-lutsenko-2013-ac-521p_7a6e131a214513c71277fa82e355472a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
