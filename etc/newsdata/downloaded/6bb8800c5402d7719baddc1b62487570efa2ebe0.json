The NDP has long stated that the new NAFTA doesn't go far enough to protect Canadian workers.\n\nThe protracted negotiations for a new free trade deal with the United States may be over, but the painful sting of tariffs on steel and aluminum \u2014 and the threat of auto tariffs \u2014 are still fresh in the memory of Canadian workers.\n\nAt a Saturday campaign stop in Oshawa, Ont., NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh pledges to bring in new measures to revitalize the Canadian car industry if his party is elected to form government. 0:44\n\nLiberals campaign on NAFTA\n\nIt's those lingering feelings the Liberals tapped into with a new ad released on Saturday.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland narrates the commercial as scenes of the NAFTA renegotiations and tariff battle flash across the screen.\n\nFreeland, a central figure in those trade negotiations, says the Liberals fought \"tooth and nail\" and stood up to the Americans.\n\nThe ad ends with a pledge that the Liberals will always support \"hard-working Canadians.\"\n\nAfter more than a year of tense talks, a deal was reached last fall. However, because the trade deal is stalled in the U.S. Congress, Canada has put off ratifying the new NAFTA.\n\nFrom right, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, U.S. President Donald Trump, Mexico's Secretary of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto sign the new trade deal in Buenos Aires on Nov. 30, 2018. It has yet to be ratified in Canada and the U.S. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\n\nU.S. tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminum remained in place for months after an agreement was reached, finally removed by President Donald Trump in May of this year.\n\nCanada's auto industry was heavily affected. About 2.2 million cars were produced in Ontario in 2017, but the auto industry has shifted operations to Mexico and China. Canadian plants, such as the GM operation in Oshawa, are on the chopping block.\n\nBut bad blood over trade deals isn't the only threat. A report from the Ontario government this year warned production has fallen 25 per cent in the last two decades as production gets cheaper elsewhere.\n\nThe auto industry contributes $19 billion to Canada's GDP and is one of the country's largest manufacturing sectors. The industry and related labour employs more than half a million people, according to Statistics Canada.\n\nNew measures, old idea\n\nIt's those jobs Singh says he's looking to protect with the $300-million investment for innovation that would emphasize sustainability.\n\nThe idea isn't new.\n\nIn 2008, the Harper government introduced similar funding, pledging $250 million over five years to support green research and development in the auto sector. Harper extended those funds in 2013, and the program was also expanded in 2016 under Justin Trudeau.\n\nThe NDP \u2014 which historically has done well in manufacturing towns in Ontario \u2014 says the difference is its policy would shift the focus to made-in-Canada cars.\n\nIt's tricky to define a made-in-Canada car, because the North American automotive industry is so intertwined. Car parts bounce back and forth across the border several times before the finished product is ready.\n\nSingh says his definition is \"When a car is manufactured in Canada and it puts people to work in Canada.\"\n\nMore questions about candidates\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer was also in eastern Ontario on Saturday, campaigning in Kanata-Carleton with his candidate Justina McCaffrey.\n\nSpeaking to the crowd mostly comprised of families, Scheer said he's focused on putting more money in their pockets and helping them feel like the future is stable.\n\nBut his economic message \u2014 cancelling the carbon tax and introducing a new transit tax credit \u2014 was interrupted when McCaffrey was caught up in a social media sinkhole.\n\nThe Liberals released a video ahead of the rally depicting her describing her close friendship with Faith Goldy, who has been banned from Facebook for alt-right comments.\n\nIt's the latest in a string of candidate controversies involving each of the parties forced to grapple with inappropriate comments or social media posts from their candidates.\n\nKanata-Carleton Conservative candidate Justina McCaffrey fled from reporters' questions following a campaign rally with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer after the Liberals posted an old video with her self-described friendship with Faith Goldy \u2014 who is well-known in Ontario for her far-right political views. The candidate later put out a statement saying she has not seen Goldy in several years. 0:20\n\n\"Each party has an obligation to make sure that their candidates don't use words \u2026 that are offensive,\" Scheer said in French.\n\nHe added when there are issues Conservatives candidates have done the right thing and apologized.\n\nMcCaffrey fled from media during the event. She later issued a statement saying the video is from 2013, and she has not seen Goldy in \"several years.\"\n\nScheer said her statement spoke for itself.", "description": "The Liberals and the NDP\u00a0are targeting\u00a0votes from Canadian autoworkers\u00a0with different takes on the renegotiation\u00a0of the NAFTA\u00a0trade deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5283896.1568470498!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/singh-oshawa-car-announcement-september-14-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
