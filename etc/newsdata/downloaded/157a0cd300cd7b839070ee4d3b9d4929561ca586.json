Top Democrats say testimony and evidence coming in from other witnesses, and even the president himself, are backing up the whistleblower's account of what transpired during Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy. Lawmakers have grown deeply concerned about protecting the person from Trump's threats over the matter and may not wish to risk exposing their identity.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday, \"We don't need the whistleblower, who wasn't on the call, to tell us what took place during the call. We have the best evidence of that.\"\n\nSchiff said it \"may not be necessary\" to reveal the whistleblower's identity as the House gathers evidence. \"Our primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected,\" he said.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is testing the Constitution's system of checks and balances as the House presses forward with the probe and the White House dismisses it as \"illegitimate\" without a formal vote of the House to open impeachment proceedings.\n\nIn calling for a vote, the White House is trying to pressure House Democrats who may be politically reluctant to formally put their names behind impeachment. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has resisted those efforts and is unlikely to budge as Congress returns. Democrats say Congress is well within its power as the legislative branch to conduct oversight of the president and it is Republicans, having grown weary of Trump's actions, who may be in the greater political bind over a vote.\n\nRep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said Sunday he'd be fine with taking a formal vote, \"but it's not required.\"\n\n\"Look, my own opinion is that we ought to just take this off the table because it's such a non-issue, and there's no doubt in my mind that of course if Nancy Pelosi does that that she will have the votes and that will pass,\" Himes said.\n\nSondland's appearance comes after text messages from top ambassadors provided a vivid account of their interactions leading up to Trump's call and the aftermath.\n\nSondland is set to tell lawmakers that he did understand the administration was offering Zelenskiy a White House visit in exchange for a public statement committing to investigations Trump wanted, according to the person, who demanded anonymity to discuss remarks not yet given.\n\nBut Sondland will say his text was not based on any direct knowledge and he did not know the company talked about for an investigation, Burisma, was tied to Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, the person said. He understood the discussions about combating corruption to be part of a much broader and publicized Trump administration push that was widely shared, the person said.\n\nIn the text exchange, the diplomats raised alarm that Trump appeared to up the ante, withholding military aid to Ukraine over the investigation.\n\nOne seasoned diplomat on the text message, William Taylor, called it \"crazy to withhold security assistance\" to Ukraine in exchange for \"help with a political campaign.\"\n\nSondland responds that the assertion is \"incorrect\" about Trump's intentions. \"The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind,\" he said in the text message.\n\nSchiff appeared on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" and Himes spoke on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\n___\n\nTucker reported from Providence, Rhode Island.", "description": "A U.S. ambassador is expected to tell Congress that his text message reassuring another envoy that there was no quid pro quo in their interactions with Ukraine was based solely on what President Donald Trump told him, according to a person familiar with his upcoming testimony in the impeachment probe", "authors": ["Eric Tucker", "Mary Clare Jalonick", "Lisa Mascaro"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/i.ZA8Mg54yxtyd5GeRvtgQ--~B/aD0xNTcwO3c9MjM1NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/ef0c237296bfb768701e6f0182b6d413", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
