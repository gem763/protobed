Collins, who once sported one of the highest approval ratings in the country, has seen her bipartisan support drop in the wake of her yes vote. One recent public poll shows her with the second-highest disapproval rating in the Senate (behind Majority Leader Mitch McConnell); a poll conducted by an outside group in July shows her with a more respectable 49-41 favorable-unfavorable rating. Democrats recruited a top candidate, state House Speaker Sara Gideon, to challenge her. Gideon referenced Collins\u2019s Kavanaugh vote in her announcement video.\n\nWhile many other Senate candidates have sidestepped the Kavanaugh news, Collins and Gideon have embraced the issue. After the latest accusation against Kavanaugh was reported, Collins spokeswoman Annie Clark released a statement dismissing the controversy. \u201cThis is an allegation that lacks an accuser. \u2026 Not only did the student in question not recall such an incident, she also declined to be interviewed for the book.\u201d\n\nAfter Collins\u2019s reaction, Gideon reiterated her opposition to Kavanaugh, writing on Twitter: \u201cAt the time of his confirmation, there was plenty of evidence that put into question Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s fitness for the Supreme Court. Senator Collins cast a critical vote to confirm him anyway, and she said she doesn\u2019t regret it.\u201d A Gideon spokeswoman told National Journal that she \u201cwould need more information\u201d to decide whether to support impeaching the justice.", "description": "", "authors": ["Josh Kraushaar", "Nationaljournal.Com S Unlock"], "top_image": ""}
