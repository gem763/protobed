Taking the life of a person who is very innocent, who has been very supportive of farmers, is not an answer.\"\n\nMajor General Parlade, the spokesman for the president\u2019s new national task force to end the communist armed conflict, pledged to help the national police investigate his killing.\n\nBut when pressed about other cases where families insist innocent people were killed, Parlade maintains those who are killed must have fought back.\n\n\"There will be no killing if there is no armed resistance,\" he says.\n\nAs the death toll rises, 101 East investigates Duterte\u2019s new war.\n\nJoin the conversation @AJ101East\n\nSource: Al Jazeera", "description": "In the Philippines, the president's latest war is claiming the lives of farmers, activists and political opponents.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/11/bc4d3da4bc3444bb95b74fe63db6e4f4_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
