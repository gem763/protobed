Eddie Jones unleashed the international rookies in tandem, calling them his \u2018Kamikaze Kids\u2019.\n\nAt club level, Tom Curry has formed a highly effective alliance with his brother. Sale Sharks regard the twins as valuable, home-grown assets who have both been secured on long-term contracts.\n\nThey are all-action, modern-day forwards.\n\nBen Curry was picked first by Jones in 2017, but suffered an injury and was replaced on the bench by Tom, who made a positive impact and went on to make his Test debut in Argentina weeks later. He has flourished since.\n\nBen\u2019s flying visit to his brother\u2019s date with World Cup destiny seems certain to inspire him to join Tom in the England side. If England fans are happy to have one Curry, they may soon be enjoying second helpings.\n\nAfter securing his spot on the plane, Ben told Sportsmail: \u2018It is about going there to support Tom, we have been together all our lives and it would feel unnatural not be there to support him on one of his biggest days of his life.\n\n\u2018As a family we are massively proud of him.\n\nEngland's Tom Curry will be preparing to take on South Africa in Saturday's World Cup final\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t state how appreciative I am towards Sale for letting me go, it shows what a family orientated club they are and I am hugely appreciative of everyone involved in helping me get to Japan.\u2019\n\nSome fans joked that all the retweets came from members of the Curry family, while others thought they may have come from Bristol fans hoping their opponents would be a man down for Friday.\n\nSale are actually guaranteed two World Cup winners, as flanker Tom Curry and Mark Wilson play for England, while scrum half Faf De Klerk and lock Lood de Jager play for South Africa.\n\nTom, the younger brother by 90 minutes, has earned rave reviews for a series of stunning displays as England topped their pool.\n\nAfter he was named man of the match in the quarter-final victory over Australia, a video of Tom awkwardly accepting his prize went viral \u2013 and Ben took particular joy from the incident.\n\nHe said: \u2018I replay that daily! That is my morning wake up, that gets me in a good mood. I showed as many people as I could. It could have happened to anyone, it is not his fault at all, but it couldn\u2019t have happened to a better person. When I saw it I was so happy.\u2019\n\nBen will join a sizeable crowd of supporters in Japan, with their parents David and Susanne there since the quarter-final, while their sister Charlotte, a cousin, godparents and around half-a-dozen friends will be in the crowd too.\n\nBen added: \u2018I was going to keep it a surprise but it would have been quite hard!\n\nBen Curry is also a flanker, but is yet to make his senior debut for the England team\n\n\u2018I had to tell him because we needed a ticket, we couldn\u2019t get round the fact he needed an extra ticket. We tried saying it was for another family member but it just fell apart so I just had to say I was coming.\n\n\u2018There is no point rocking up all the way to Japan without a ticket.\n\n\u2018We have got a lot of very good people around us, if it was me in that position it would be exactly the same.\n\n\u2018We are massively appreciative of everyone supporting Tom back home.\u2019\n\nThe pair, both 21, share a house together in Manchester, but Ben admitted that spending nearly two months apart was a positive experience for both of them.\n\nHe added: \u2018We have exchanged the odd message. It's like an old married couple, when you have been in each others pockets your whole life, a couple of months apart is probably quite nice and get out of each others hair.\n\n\u2018There are not many chances you get to be individual as an identical twin so it is a good chance for him to explore himself and for me to grow as an individual myself.\u2019\n\nBen, who captained England to an Under-20s World Cup final defeat by France in 2018, had originally been picked to play for the senior side ahead of Tom against the Barbarians in 2017 but was forced to pull out with a back injury. Tom took his place, won match of the match from the bench and has not looked back.\n\nOn his own England dream, Ben said: \u2018It is about improving everyday learning from Tom.\n\n\u2018We are on our separate journeys, I want to play for England and that hasn\u2019t changed. Obviously the dream outcome is to play together for our country one day.\u2019\n\nOn the final itself, Ben was determined not to curse his countrymen\n\nHe said: \u2018If they play like they did against New Zealand they will do well. It is about repeating that performance and going one better, but I don\u2019t want to jinx it all!\u2019\n\nThey head into the final against South Africa as favourites as they look to capture their second World Cup victory.", "description": "Ben Curry, the identical twin of Tom Curry, the England flanker, is on his way to Tokyo to watch his brother play in the World Cup final, thanks to a social media campaign.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20287492-0-image-a-2_1572280171065.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
