Now Palestinians Are Demanding Answers.", "language": "en", "text": "Samir Arbeed was arrested by Israeli forces outside his workplace in the West Bank on September 25 in connection with a bomb attack that killed a 17-year-old Israeli girl. Two days later, the 44-year-old Palestinian and member of the militant Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine was rushed to the emergency room, unconscious. Six of his ribs were broken and his kidney had gone into failure.\n\nWhat happened between his arrest and hospitalization is now a topic of fierce interest for Palestinians, who argue that Arbeed\u2019s injuries are physical proof of a dark reality they\u2019ve long known to be true: Israel\u2019s security forces routinely torture and abuse Palestinian prisoners with impunity.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about two or three interrogators who have gone insane. It\u2019s not about rotten apples. This is a whole system,\u201d said Rachel Stroumsa, head of the Public Committee Against Torture, an independent rights watchdog based in Tel Aviv. \u201cWhat we see here with Samir Arbeed is unusual in its consequences but not unusual in any other sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about two or three interrogators who have gone insane. It\u2019s not about rotten apples. This is a whole system\u201d\n\nSince 2001, the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel has filed over 1,200 torture complaints on behalf of Palestinians to the Israeli Attorney General. The vast majority of cases have never seen the light of day, let alone result in any charges.\n\nBut Arbeed\u2019s predicament is unique because he ended up in the hospital with severe injuries. The Shin Bet did not respond to requests from VICE News for comment, and only told Israeli news outlets that a Shin Bet agent reported Arbeed \u201cdid not feel well\u201d and that he was then \u201ctransferred to the hospital for medical examinations and treatment.\"\n\n\u201cHe was tortured severely,\u201d said Sahar Francis, the director of Addameer, a Palestinian prisoner support group providing Arbeed with legal representation. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for it. This is a war crime at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nNow, Palestinian activists and human rights watchdogs are calling for greater scrutiny of the Shin Bet\u2019s shadowy practices, and criminal charges for the interrogators and higher-ups who approve of torture.\n\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s authorities must end their systematic use of torture and ensure that those responsible for the torture of Samir Arbeed, including those with command and other superior responsibility, are held to account,\u201d said Saleh Higazi, Amnesty International\u2019s Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director, in a statement.\n\nIsraeli police arrests a man during a protest outside a hospital in Jerusalem where Palestinian suspect is being treated, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2019.

These tactics are typically reserved for Palestinians suspected of involvement in militant activity.\n\nArbeed\u2019s story isn\u2019t the first time the public has been confronted with the grisly details of what the shadowy Shin Bet does in carrying out its mission to protect Israelis from Palestinian militant attacks. What has changed, however, is how Israeli society is reacting to such violence.\n\n\n\nThe last time the Shin Bet\u2019s abuse captured widespread, sustained interest was in 1984, when intelligence agents severely beat and then executed two Palestinians who had just hijacked a bus. That affair, and the attempted cover-up, resulted in the Shin Bet directing blame at a decorated army general. The charges shook Israelis to their core.\n\n\u201cThere was huge political turmoil \u2014 one of the biggest political scandals in the country,\u201d said Ronen Bergman, a staff writer for the New York Times Magazine and author of \u201cRise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel\u2019s Targeted Assassinations.\u201d \u201c[Israelis] were appalled and shocked that the Shin Bet, in order to save their necks, rebelled against democracy. They used the tools they used against spies and terrorists against their fellow generals and against the prime minister himself.\u201d\n\nBut 35 years on, the Israeli public barely seems to care about allegations of Shin Bet abuse anymore. Arbeed's case has failed to generate much interest beyond local coverage, let alone garner the sort of widespread public outcry that followed the 1984 killings.\n\n\u201cThere is a very strong mainstream attitude of, \u2018whatever these people got, they deserve it,\u2019\u201d said Stroumsa of the Public Committee Against Torture.\n\nPalestinians say this harsh sentiment has created a culture of impunity for Israeli officers who torture suspects, regardless of the laws in place to protect against such abuses.\n\n\u201cThere is a very strong mainstream attitude of, \u2018whatever these people got, they deserve it'\u201d\n\nUnder a landmark 1999 Israeli Supreme Court ruling, Shin Bet officers were banned from torturing Palestinian suspects. But that ruling carved out a major loophole: Shin Bet agents who apply physical pressure on detainees were shielded from criminal prosecution if it was a \u201cticking bomb\u201d scenario \u2014 one in which a detainee had information about an imminent threat to Israelis.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court expanded the 1999 ruling\u2019s loophole, by ruling that the extreme physical methods used on a Palestinian suspect were legitimate because he knew where weapons were stashed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a general deference to the executive on national security in Israel,\u201d said Elena Chachko, a Harvard Law School lecturer and former clerk for an Israeli Supreme Court justice. And with the 2018 ruling, \u201cthe precedent has been stretched considerably to circumstances I wouldn\u2019t call \u2018ticking bomb\u2019 scenarios,\u201d she said.\n\nThose legal rulings have resulted in virtually all complaints of torture being dismissed. Israel\u2019s Attorney General has launched only one criminal investigation into a torture allegation since 2001.\n\nArbeed remains in the hospital recovering from his injuries as his lawyers try to prevent Israel from sending him back to interrogation, where he is barred for now from legal representation because of his status as a terror suspect.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Ministry of Justice told VICE News in a statement that it is investigating his treatment, but Palestinians have little to no hope that the inquiry will bring criminal charges.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust this procedure,\u201d said Francis, the head of Addameer. \u201cWe always suspect these investigations won\u2019t end in real accountability. It\u2019s normal and accepted [in Israel] that Palestinians would be tortured by the security services.\u201d\n\nAlex Kane is a New York-based freelance journalist who writes on Israel/Palestine and civil liberties issues.\n\nCover: Israeli police detain a woman during a protest outside a hospital in Jerusalem where Palestinian suspect is being treated, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2019.
