Really I think we created more chances than them, the better chances, but tonight we didn\u2019t achieve the efficiency to win that match.\n\n\u2018We conceded more corners to them than we wanted, and from one they scored. Also, when they are pushing and they are taking a lot of corners, they can do that.\n\n\u2018We created more corners, 12 [compared to] seven or eight for them, and also we had the chances and had a very clear penalty to Sokratis.\n\n\u2018In the second half it was not easy to get chances, I think we controlled the ball more with possession because they conceded metres on the pitch and we had chances to score, but we didn\u2019t achieve that goal to draw and the try to win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think we deserved more, I don\u2019t think we deserved to lose that match but also I appreciate their work and they are here with their supporters and with that result, they felt strong to achieve that result. But we worked, but I can say for our players their attitude was good, they tried and I think we deserved more.\u2019\n\nMORE: Arsenal legend Ian Wright criticises Unai Emery for dropping Dani Ceballos against Sheffield United\n\nMORE: Unai Emery issues challenge to Nicolas Pepe after Arsenal star missed sitter vs Sheffield United", "description": "Unai Emery attempted to defend Arsenal's performance during their 1-0 defeat against Sheffield United by pointing out that his side 'created more corners'.
