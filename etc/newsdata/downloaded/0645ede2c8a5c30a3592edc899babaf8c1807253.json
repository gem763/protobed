Keep in mind, I am not a lawyer and you should always consult a qualified attorney for legal advice, but here are some frequently asked questions (and their answers) on common inheritance issues.\n\nQ.: How much can a person leave to kids without an estate tax? My friend says that if I gave them any money while I\u2019m alive, I might have to pay the tax.\n\nA.: If you made a gift subject to gift taxes and opted to use part of your lifetime gift tax exclusion, the amount subject to gift tax reduces the amount you can leave at death free of estate taxes. So, your friend can be correct but the estate & gift tax exemption I am referring to applies to $11.4 million in 2019. Married couples that plan well have $22.8 million to work with. These amounts could be reduced in future legislation but for now they are indexed for inflation. As a result, most people will not have estates subject to estate taxes even if they lower their exemption by gifting away substantial sums during their lifetime.\n\nQ.: I have an IRA with my wife as \u201cprimary beneficiary\u201d and a cash account held in joint ownership. Our wills state that if one dies the other gets everything. When I die, what steps does she need to take to get those accounts in her name? I assume she just needs to provide a death certificate. Is that correct?\n\nA.: Usually, a death certificate and a form or two is all that is required. The will has no bearing on the accounts you listed. As a joint account, the cash account becomes hers as a matter of law upon your death. Since she is named primary beneficiary on the IRA, she will have all the rights of a spousal beneficiary including the ability to roll it into her own IRA. The will typically applies only to assets titled in just your name as an individual without a beneficiary designation.\n\nQ.: When I received my broker statement from my nonspousal Inherited Roth IRA, I was surprised at the RMD number. The nonspousal Inherited Roth is based on a Single Life Table and is 13.4 years barely more than half the life expectancy on my RMD from my regular IRA. Why?\n\nA.: IRAs inherited from a non-spouse use a single life expectancy scale to calculate required minimum distributions. The scale on your personal IRA uses a joint life expectancy. My understanding of the rationale behind using a single life table for non-spouse Inherited IRAs and inherited Roth IRAs is to do exactly what you are seeing. The shorter scale forces the funds out of the tax favored account at a faster rate.\n\nQ.: If something happens to me, can I pass on this inherited Roth IRA again? What are the new conditions for the new recipient? Or, what happens to it?\n\nA.: Yes, you can pass the account on to whomever you choose by properly designating them as your beneficiaries. When they inherit, they must continue to use the exact same RMD schedule you used on the inherited account.\n\nQ.: I lost my husband a month ago and my in-law\u2019s name is on his beneficiary. Will I as his spouse be entitled to anything for my kids an myself?\n\nA.: I am sorry for your loss. You may be entitled to some funds, but you should see a good lawyer and quickly.\n\nNormally, a beneficiary designation on an account directs who inherits assets and supersedes any will or trust that may direct the inheritance of other assets. However, many states have \u201celective share\u201d statutes that entitle surviving spouses to some percentage of their deceased spouse\u2019s assets. This document gives a brief rundown of those laws. These statutes vary greatly with respect to how much a widow can get, the type of property that is eligible for the election, and the deadline for filing.\n\nI suggest you call an attorney quickly because there have been a number of cases in which a widow has filed a claim on assets, but the assets were already distributed to the named beneficiaries and spent, making recovering the widow\u2019s share difficult.\n\nIf you have a question for Dan, please email him with \u201cMarketWatch Q&A\u201d on the subject line.\n\nDan Moisand\u2019s comments are for informational purposes only and are not a substitute for personalized advice.
