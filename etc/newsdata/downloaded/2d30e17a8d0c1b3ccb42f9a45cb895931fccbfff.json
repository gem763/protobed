He genuinely seems to have a sixth sense for when a funeral is about to take place and will turn up just before to pay his respects. If the family ask for him to stay, we allow him to.\n\n\u201cEvery funeral is unique, but Paddy does provide that extra special touch, helping provide comfort, affection and even entertainment for families at one of the most difficult times in their lives.\n\n\u201cHis timing is impeccable.
