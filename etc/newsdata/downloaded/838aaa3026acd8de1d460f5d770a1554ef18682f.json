The company will be releasing its third quarter delivery and production numbers by no later than October 3. A \u201c leak ed\u201d email revealed the company was close to 100,000 deliveries in the third quarter.If the stock can ever manage to get beyond this resistance zone between 253 to 260, it would open the door for the share to return $300.\n\nApple (NASDAQ: ) has this descending triangle that is forming. It could mean that shares are due to fall to around $209.\n\nNetflix Inc Chart\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ: )\n\nRoku (ROKU)\n\nRoku Inc Daily Chart\n\nNetflix has this flag pattern that has formed on the intraday chart, and at the very least, it suggests that shares challenge resistance at $273.\n\nI don\u2019t think Roku is finished falling, not yet. Perhaps this week it will test support $92.\n\nRegeneron (REGN)\n\nRegeneron Inc Daily Chart\n\nRegeneron is one of those biotech stocks that are getting slammed. The stock is fighting on to hold support in the $270 to $280 range. The next significant level to watch is around $218. That declining relative strength index suggests the stock continues to fall.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Michael Kramer covering: Apple Inc, Netflix Inc, Tesla Inc.
