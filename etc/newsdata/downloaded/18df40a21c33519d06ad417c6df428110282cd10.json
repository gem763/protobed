When are you going to stop modelling? When are you going to stop doing what you\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019m like, \u201c40 is not old, people! \u2026 Like, I should just stay at home and not do anything anymore? I\u2019m going to show you what\u2019s old or how I\u2019m going to be old.\u201d So, that\u2019s how I got that idea.\u2019\n\nWe bow down.\n\nHeidi\u2019s favourite was this masterpiece (Picture: Amanda Schwab/Starpix/REX)\n\nHeidi has already dressed up once this year, coating herself in glitter as she attended Paris Hilton\u2019s Halloween bash with husband Tom Kaulitz.\n\nHowever, after last year\u2019s Shrek and Fiona double act, we have very high hopes for Heidi\u2019s main get-up on Thursday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe German star previously teased elements of her costume \u2013 having her body computer-mapped, getting a grill fitted and saying it will be difficult to walk in.\n\nWe can hardly wait.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
