The president is also battling a widening impeachment investigation over his push for a Ukraine-led investigation into the Bidens that has ensnared top officials at the State Department.\n\nHuntsman\u2019s tenure in Moscow has been marked by tit-for-tat sanctions and diplomatic expulsions, fallout from Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 elections, and warnings that the Kremlin plans to meddle again in 2020.\n\nThe U.S. has also struggled with the Kremlin's aggression in cyberspace and its intrusion into other international affairs \u2014 most notably in Venezuela and Syria \u2014 and new diplomatic forays with North Korea, as well as the deterioration of several arms control treaties, including the longstanding Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty. Trump has frequently expressed his desire to ink a new nuclear treaty with Putin to head off an arms race, though the chances of the two countries negotiating and ratifying a new deal before next year\u2019s election are slim.\n\nIn his confirmation hearing for the deputy job, Sullivan vowed to take a hard line on Russia, calling for a \u201crobust\u201d response to Russia\u2019s \u201cintrusion into our democracy.\u201d\n\nSullivan was confirmed by the Senate in 2017 by a 94-6 vote, a sizable margin in the polarized age of Trump. And Sullivan has been well-regarded at State, including under Rex Tillerson, who was widely disliked, a factor Trump nodded to in August.\n\nBut Sullivan cropped up Friday in the latest testimony secured by House Democrats for their impeachment probe, which was taking place as Trump announced Sullivan\u2019s appointment. In a deposition before three House committees, former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told lawmakers that she\u2019d been removed from her post for political reasons.\n\nAccording to her prepared opening statement, Yovanovitch, a career diplomat, said she spoke to Sullivan upon being abruptly recalled from Kyiv in April. Yovanovitch told lawmakers Sullivan informed her the president had lost confidence in her, and that in the face of a concerted campaign for her ouster, State had been under pressure to fire her since the year before.\n\n\u201cHe also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause,\u201d Yovanovitch planned to tell lawmakers. That campaign is said to have been spearheaded by Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer who\u2019s sought to dig up dirt, with Ukraine\u2019s help, on Trump\u2019s potential 2020 rival Joe Biden.\n\nThere\u2019s been no indication thus far that Sullivan had any involvement in Trump and Giuliani\u2019s plans, but Democrats have lashed the State Department for stonewalling and blocking witness testimony for their investigation. Last week, Democrats sent Sullivan a letter demanding State begin cooperating with its investigation, accusing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of having conflicts of interest with regards to the probe.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1f/3a/c17185e541d1a2fecb31f08169da/191011-john-sullivan-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
