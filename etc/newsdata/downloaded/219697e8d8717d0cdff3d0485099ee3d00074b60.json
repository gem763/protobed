But in light of both Tommen\u2019s and Margaery\u2019s deaths in Season 6, Ser Pounce\u2019s fate was largely unknown.\n\n\u201cI like to think he\u2019d also move on with his life and get a girlfriend maybe,\u201d Chapman told HuffPost at the time.\n\nAhead of Season 8, though, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss revealed to Entertainment Weekly that Pounce\u2019s nine lives had run out at the hands of Cersei (Lena Headey).\n\n\u201cSer Pounce\u2019s death was so horrible we couldn\u2019t even put it on the air,\u201d Benioff said.\n\nSo, at New York Comic-Con on Thursday, HuffPost asked Chapman for his reaction to Ser Pounce\u2019s off-camera demise.\n\n\u201cYeah, it took me. It got me. I cried,\u201d he joked, before saying he hadn\u2019t actually watched the last season of the series, but had heard what happened.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many different versions of what could happen in it, and the way it went, that\u2019s just the way it went. So Ser Pounce had to die. Just the way it was,\u201d said Chapman.\n\nPerhaps making the death a little easier to bear for Chapman (other than the fact Ser Pounce was a fictional cat) was finding out he was cast in his new project, director Sam Mendes\u2019 \u201c1917.\u201d The actor said it was the happiest he\u2019s ever been.\n\n\u201cI just screamed, and when I got off the phone, I still screamed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe World War I movie, slated for this December, depicts the story of two young British soldiers, Blake (Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), as they try to deliver a message in time to stop a devastating attack. Besides the intensity of it being a war film, \u201c1917\u201d aims to look like one continuous shot.\n\n\u201cNone of it was easy,\u201d Chapman explained. \u201cBlake and Schofield get sent on this mission to save 1,600 men\u2019s lives, and Blake\u2019s own brother is one of the 1,600. So Blake\u2019s stakes throughout the whole film are so high and, as an actor, to turn up every day and every single take be able to portray that, that was emotionally draining for me. But I loved every single minute of it.\u201d\n\nLeaving us with some parting words for Ser Pounce, Chapman said, \u201cHe had a good life, and Tommen looked after him very well. He was well-fed, well-watered and Tommen took care of him. He\u2019s now with Tommen, so it\u2019s not so bad. It\u2019s not such a bad ending.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nKing Tommen Finally Reveals Why We Never Saw Ser Pounce Again\n\n'Game Of Thrones' Wins Best Drama At Emmys After Divisive Final Season\n\nThe Final Season Of 'Game Of Thrones' Was A Song Of Hype And Ire\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nDany (Emilia Clarke)\n\nJon (Kit Harington) and Dany (Emilia Clarke)", "description": "Dean-Charles Chapman on \"1917\" and remembering King Tommen's fallen feline friend.", "authors": ["Bill Bradley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Yzh9Qn.HqG9QTyWPYEm_OA--~B/aD0yMTk2O3c9MzMwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9771a52100005000a94b98.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
