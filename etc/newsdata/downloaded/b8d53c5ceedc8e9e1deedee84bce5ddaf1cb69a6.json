Secretary of state Mike Pompeo had said he did not want five of his officials whose testimony had been sought by Democrats to cooperate.\n\nMr Trump has repeatedly denounced the investigation that has been launched into his actions as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d. At the weekend he sparked controversy when he retweeted the words of a pastor who had warned that if Mr Trump were impeached, it would fracture society in a way similar to the civil war.\n\nYet the language he used on Tuesday appeared to escalate matters to a new level, and may have been intended to energise those supporters who believe the president is being undermined from within by the so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d.\n\nIndeed, his words echoed those of former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich, a firm supporter of Mr Trump who claimed in a Fox News opinion article that the real estate mogul was the target of an attempted \u201ccoup d\u2019etat\u201d by Democrats.\n\n\u201cSo, Pelosi rushes out ... announces, \u2018We\u2019re moving forward on impeachment\u2019. They have not yet met with the whistleblower. They have not yet received the transcript of the phone call. Nothing had changed except the sheer pressure of her left. And she couldn\u2019t get away from it!\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd that sort of captures this whole process. That\u2019s where we are right now. This is not an impeachment; this is a coup d\u2019etat,\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, senior White House advisor Stephen Miller appeared on Fox News to denounce the whistleblower and allege that accusations were not only false, but that the individual was not genuine.\n\n\u201cI know what the deep state looks like,\u201d said Mr Miller declared. \u201cI know the difference between a whistleblower and a deep state operative. This is a deep state operative, pure and simple.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump has issued his most inflammatory condemnation yet of the impeachment investigation against him, labelling it \u201ca COUP\u201d designed to strip Americans of their freedoms.
