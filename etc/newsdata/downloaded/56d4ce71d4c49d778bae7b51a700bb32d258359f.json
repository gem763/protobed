But unless he finds a legal loophole, this could land the prime minister in court and further divide his party\n\n- Boris Johnson has said he \"will not\" carry out Parliament's instructions to seek an Article 50 extension, according to The Daily Telegraph.

Dr White calls this \"risky\", with no guarantee the Queen would nominate Mr Corbyn as interim leader.

This is something I will never do.\"\n\nNo 10 said an election would allow the public to choose between the government's approach - Mr Johnson's commitment to leave on 31 October, either with a re-negotiated deal or no deal - and \"more delay, more dither\" from Labour.\n\nBut opposition MPs say they will only agree to an election when the extension to the Brexit deadline has been secured, to ensure the UK does not \"crash out\" without a deal.\n\nWhat does the no-deal bill say?\n\nThe bill, presented by Labour MP Hilary Benn, says the prime minister will have until 19 October to either pass a deal in Parliament or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit.\n\nOnce this deadline has passed, he will have to request an extension to the UK's departure date to 31 January 2020.\n\nUnusually, the bill stipulates the wording of the letter Mr Johnson would have to write to the president of the European Council.\n\nIf the EU responds by proposing a different date, the PM will have two days to accept that proposal.\n\nDuring that time, MPs - not the government - will have the opportunity to reject that date.\n\nThe bill also requires ministers to report to the House of Commons over the next few months. potentially providing more opportunities to take control of the timetable.", "description": "A cross-party group is preparing legal action in case Boris Johnson refuses to request a Brexit delay.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/622F/production/_108653152_mediaitem108652367.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
