Ethiopian Federal Police said nine people had been arrested on the eve of the festival for attempting to smuggle weapons within the capital.\n\nThe peaceful start was in contrast to 2016 when a stampede triggered by a clash between police and protesters left more than 50 people dead.\n\n\"This time everything is peaceful. We are all happy as this represents the unity of Oromos,\" said Megrarobi after performing his thanksgiving ritual that involves touching water with yellow flowers and grass.\n\nThe festival is usually held in Bishoftu, a town located in the Oromia region, about 40 km (25 miles) south of Addis Ababa. The celebrations, which returtned to the capital for the first time in 150 years, are due to be followed by a larger event on Sunday in Bishoftu.\n\nThe Oromo, who make up about a third of Ethiopia's population of more than 100 million, have long complained of being marginalized during decades of authoritarian rule by governments led by politicians from other smaller ethnic groups.\n\nPrime Minister Abiy has pursued a reconciliation strategy since taking power in April 2018. He has implemented a series of radical economic and political reforms including releasing political prisoners and restoring relations with arch-foe Eritrea.\n\nThe reforms have opened up what was once one of Africa's most repressive nations but also stoked violence as emboldened regional strongmen build ethnic powerbases and compete over political influence and resources.
