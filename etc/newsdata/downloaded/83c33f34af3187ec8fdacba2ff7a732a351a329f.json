The passenger then reboarded the train in another car and sat down.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that cell phone video often fails to capture the full context of an interaction,\u201d Ly wrote in an email.\n\nLy said the officer \u201cdeployed a short burst\u201d of pepper spray \u201cwhile attempting to gain compliance from an individual who refused multiple directives to exit the train due to her behavior. \u201d\n\nThe video, shot by another passenger, begins after the officer confronted a female passenger sitting just inside the doors of a stopped Red Line train at the station. The officer appears to be pulling the passenger\u2019s black jacket with his left hand as he says, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThe female passenger responds, \u201cFool, stop touching me!\u201d as the officer says \u201cMiss.\u201d The passenger begins screaming and leaves the seat. Just after she walks off the screen \u2014 away from the officer and while cursing at him\u2014 the officer sprays something in her direction.\n\nAnother passenger who appears to be with her screams, \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d as the first female passenger continues screaming off camera. The officer backs away, saying \u201cOC utilized\u201d into his shoulder radio, and leaves the train amid sounds of the female passenger screaming and other passengers beginning to cough.\n\n\u201cOC spray\u201d is another term for pepper spray.\n\nLy said commanders will review the incident as they do all those that involve use of force.\n\nThe video was posted on Twitter by a user with the Twitter handle @F---RonaldRegan. Someone who responded via a direct message from that account said they shot the video around 3 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe videographer, who gave their name as Chala from Montgomery County, said they were wearing headphones before beginning to shoot the video and didn\u2019t know how the situation started.\n\n\u201cI just saw a large officer manhandling a young girl, so that caused me to start filming,\u201d Chala said via a direct message on Twitter. \u201cI only caught this brief moment before the pepper spray started filling the train car, and I had to leave because I couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why they started filming, Chala wrote, \u201cI was concerned because he was yanking her by her arm as her friend tried to plead with him, and she looked young to me.\u201d\n\nThe officer eventually removed the passenger from the train and put her in handcuffs, Chala wrote.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what charges the passenger may face.", "description": "A video shot by another passenger shows the woman screaming and other passengers coughing.", "authors": ["Katherine Shaver", "Reporter Covering Urban Planning", "Transportation Issues", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lW_HkKZh_CL0mhGz0Ec6kZcx5dU=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-17-2019/t_709f933536b54e488ab3e8319899677d_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_00_07_28_Still015.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
