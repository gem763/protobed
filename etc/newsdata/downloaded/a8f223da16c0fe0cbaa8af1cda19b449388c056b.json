On Tuesday, the Fed swapped $99 billion of cash for securities held by banks.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who chairs the Financial Stability Oversight Council, Warren asked the secretary to explain the causes of the market turmoil. She pointed out that many of the early attempts to explain the disruption\u2013including large corporates tax payments due in mid-September\u2013either never made much sense or fail to explain why the market continues to need so much additional liquidity.\n\n\u201cI am also concerned that, \u2018Big U.S. banks are using the recent chaos short funding markets as an opportunity to pressure the Federal Reserve to ease liquidity requirements they l1ave long despised,'\u201d Warren wrote, quoting from a Reuters report.\n\nThe Fed imposed new liquidity requirements after the financial crisis in an effort to avoid having to bail out banks in the future. Banks are supposed to have enough liquid assets, primarily cash and Treasury bonds, that they could sustain a short-term market disruption. Prior to the new regulations, many large financial institutions were often just days away from collapse if they could not obtain short-term funding.\n\nMany on Wall Street now believe the liquidity regulations are playing a role in the problems with the short-term funding market, encouraging banks to \u201choard liquidity\u201d rather than lend it out. And, indeed, this is quickly becoming part of the case for reforming the liquidity requirements.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren takes notice of the banks attempting to make the most out of the crisis in the short-term funding market. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/lgbtq-cnn-townhall-elizabeth-warren-101019-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
