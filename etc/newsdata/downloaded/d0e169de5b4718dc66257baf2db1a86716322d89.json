Schiff.\n\n\u201cChairman Adam Schiff has been lying to the American people for years. Now he is so desperate to damage the president he literally made up a false version of a phone call,\u201d Mr. McCarthy, a California Republican, said in a tweet.\n\nThe measure to censure Mr. Schiff, a California Democrat, was introduced by last week by Rep. Andy Biggs, the incoming chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nMr. Biggs, an Arizona Republican, introduced the measure after Mr. Schiff misrepresented the phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenky that is now the center of an impeachment inquiry in Washington.\n\nIn his opening statement during a hearing with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, Mr. Schiff said the president ordered his Ukrainian counterpart to \u201cmake up dirt\u201d on 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden, the former vice president.\n\n\u201cI have a favor I want from you,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m only going to say it seven times so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it, on this and that.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump did not ask Mr. Zelensky to make up dirt on his political rival, according to a transcript of the phone call released last week by the White House.\n\nThe measure alleges Mr. Schiff \u201cmisled the American people\u201d and made \u201ca mockery of the impeachment process\u201d with \u201cegregiously false and fabricated retelling.\u201d\n\nMr. Biggs said members of the intelligence committee have lost faith in the chairman\u2019s ability to lead the panel.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Trump called Mr. Schiff \u201csick\u201d and said the congressman should resign over misrepresenting the phone conversation.\n\n\u201cCongressman Adam Schiff should resign for the Crime of, after reading a transcript of my conversation with the President of Ukraine (it was perfect), fraudulently fabricating a statement of the President of the United States and reading it to Congress, as though mine! \u201d Mr. Trump said in a tweet. \u201cHe is sick!\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
