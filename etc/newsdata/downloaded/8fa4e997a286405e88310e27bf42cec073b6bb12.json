I'm Meghan and I married this incredible man.\n\n\"This to me is just part of our love story.\n\n(Image: Ian Vogler / Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Ian Vogler / Daily Mirror)\n\n\"For me, when I made the choice to add those words into the speech, it was really at the last minute, I said to Harry, what do you think if I add this in. I don't know, it just felt right.\n\n\"He very kindly and supportively said 'if that's what feels right that's what you should say'.\n\n\"And it's true, before I was part of this family that's how I identified with people and connection.\n\n\"As a mother now, and as a wife now, but just as a woman and as a woman of colour, which has been to the forefront in a more prominent way.\"\n\nAfter her chat Harry walks over carrying Archie, and Meghan kisses her little boy's head before the family walk away.\n\nMeghan gave a number of honest interviews during the programme, including one where she spoke about the struggles of dealing with life in the royal spotlight .\n\nBradby asks Meghan about the \"true pressures of life in the spotlight and the toll it has taken on them both\".\n\nShe replies: \"Look, any woman especially when they are pregnant you\u2019re really vulnerable and so that was made really challenging, and then when you have a newborn \u2013 you know.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"And especially as a woman, it\u2019s a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed it\u2019s, well\u2026\"\n\nShe then cuts to thank Tom for checking how she is doing.\n\n\"And, also thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I\u2019m OK. But it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\"\n\nFollowing up on her answer, Tom asks: \"And the answer is, would it be fair to say, not really OK, as in it\u2019s really been a struggle?\"\n\nMeghan pauses before replying simply: \"Yes\".", "description": "Meghan Markle gave a powerful speech on the first day of her Royal Tour of Africa with husband Prince Harry and son Archie, but she added some extra lines at the last moment", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Itv", "Ian Vogler", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20320862.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Duke-and-Duchess-of-Sussex.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
