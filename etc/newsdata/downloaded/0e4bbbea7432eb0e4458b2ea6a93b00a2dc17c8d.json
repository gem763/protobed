What is there to discuss, really, about a semi-viscous substance designed to reduce friction during \u201chuman sex acts\u201d (per the so-specific-it\u2019s-a-little-weird Wikipedia definition)? But for a big chunk of the general population, the very existence of lube is a matter that\u2019s ripe for Discourse. More bluntly: What\u2019s with all the hang-ups that straight people seem to have about lube?\n\nRecently, one blistering hot lube take on Twitter set off a particularly high volume of pushback: the \u201cunpopular opinion\u201d that lube exists primarily for the benefit of sexually lazy guys who \u201cdon\u2019t give a shit about their partner\u2019s level of arousal.\u201d Pro-lube Twitter users (my words, not theirs, but still!) were quick to point out a number of fairly obvious reasons that this isn\u2019t true. There\u2019s the whole existence of anal sex, for starters, which can be extremely painful sans storebought lubricant. Others may have issues with lubrication for medical reasons\u2014like menopause, hormonal imbalances, or side effects from a prescription medication like antidepressants or birth control\u2014that don\u2019t correlate with how turned on they are during a hookup. Then there are the implications that all women have vaginas, and that natural lubrication is a sexual green light. (They don\u2019t, and it\u2019s not.) All in all, a sticky mess!\n\nBut \u201clube is anti-feminist\u201d isn\u2019t the only wack opinion floating around the internet about personal lube. Posts about insecure boyfriends threatened by the \u201cartificial\u201d nature of lube are a Reddit mainstay (duh) and advice columns combating anti-lube bias abound. And the articles about how to spice up the lube application process, what straight men actually think about using lube, or how often you \u201cshould\u201d use it all speak to a well of cultural anxiety around getting and staying wet that is decidedly unsexy. Taking your partner\u2019s bodily excretions too personally is a recipe for a lot of hard feelings\u2014and definitely not in the hot way.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that these concerns feel confined to the realm of cisgender, heterosexual encounters. Maybe it\u2019s just not on my straight woman radar, but I don\u2019t see queer folks experiencing the same level of lube-related hand-wringing, at least not when it comes to sexual prowess. Instead of shaming people for suggesting lube as a sexual solution, let\u2019s skip straight to the main event (get it?) and talk shop about what\u2019s the best kind of lube to buy, whether organic lube is worth it, or how weed-infused lube actually works.\n\nAs long as there are still misconceptions about the nature of arousal, it\u2019s worth learning more about lube, even if it feels a little basic. It\u2019s really just a liquid that, ideally, makes sex more pleasurable. Using it is perfectly normal and has nothing to do with sexual skill level or strength of your attraction to a partner. And remember: there\u2019s really no point in policing whatever it takes to make someone\u2019s consensual sex life as well-oiled as possible.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Katie Way on Twitter .", "description": "Sometimes a friction-reducing sexual aid is just a friction-reducing sexual aid.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9ba396e31505000ab4e871/lede/1570483404561-GettyImages-735883875.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.3745xh;0xw,0.5027xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
