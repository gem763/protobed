What started as a protest against a metro fare hike has since ballooned over concerns of rising inequality.\n\nPinera's concessions, which include a package of social reforms and a partial cabinet reschuffle, have so far failed to satsify protesters, who have demanded he resign and for a new consitution to be formed.\n\nDemonstrators clash with riot police during protests against the government economic policies, in the surroundings of the Moneda presidential palace in Santiago [Pedro Ugarte/AFP]\n\nIt is the worst unrest the country has witnessed since the 17-year-long dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, which ended in 1990.\n\n191025223542333\n\nAt least 19 people have been killed and hundreds injured. Thousands have also been detained.\n\nResponding to pressure, Pinera on Sunday lifted a state of emergency that allowed military forces on the streets. A heavy police presence remains, however.\n\nA team of UN investigators arrived in Chile earlier this week to probe allegations of rights abuses. Pinera welcomed the teaming, saying \"we have nothing to hide\".\n\nThe demonstrations have been accompanied by some vandalism and arson, which forced the shutdown of numerous subway stations.", "description": "President Sebastian Pinera calls decision 'deeply painful', but says Chile is not in the position to host the meetings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/127ec2b154374f89b4127b5bd8756f41_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
