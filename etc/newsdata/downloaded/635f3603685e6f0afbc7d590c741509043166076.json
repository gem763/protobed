The global trade watchdog will hold a special meeting of its Dispute Settlement Body on Oct. 14 to formally adopt the decision.\n\nThe dispute darkens a global economic outlook that has already been dimmed by a U.S.-China trade war now in its second year. Washington and Beijing have imposed tariffs on each other\u2019s goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nTrump wrote on Twitter the EU \u201chas for many years treated the USA very badly on Trade due to Tariffs, Trade Barriers, and more. This case going on for years, a nice victory!\u201d\n\nWashington said that, after 15 years of litigation, it would impose 10% tariffs on Airbus planes, a move that could hurt orders by U.S. airlines, and 25% duties on French wine, Scotch and Irish whiskies, and cheese from across the Continent.\n\nThe size and scope of the tariffs were reduced considerably from a $25 billion list floated by Washington this year that included helicopters, major aircraft components, seafood and luxury goods.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office said it would continually re-evaluate the tariffs based on its discussions with the EU, but could increase the tariffs \u201cat any time, or change the products affected.\u201d\n\nWhite House trader adviser Peter Navarro, speaking with Fox Business Network on Thursday, warned Europe against retaliatory measures since the U.S. tariffs were approved by the WTO.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be no tit-for-tat retaliation,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cUnder the rules of the WTO, which we\u2019re complying with here, we get to do this and they should not do anything back.\u201d\n\nBut French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said preparations were under way in Europe to react with sanctions.\n\n\u201cIf the American administration rejects the hand that has been held out by France and the European Union, we are preparing ourselves to react with sanctions,\u201d he said. .\n\nHis German counterpart, Olaf Scholz, told the mass-circulation Bild newspaper the past few months had shown that trade conflicts helped no one, adding, \u201cTherefore we will react to the new situation in a determined but considered way.\u201d\n\nBritain said it was seeking confirmation from the WTO that it had complied with the organization\u2019s rulings and should not face tariffs. U.S. tariffs on European goods have plunged the UK into a trade war between the United States and the EU just as it plans to leave the 28-nation bloc.\n\nThe Scottish Whisky Association said jobs and investment were at risk from a 25% tariff on single malt. Scotch whisky exports to the United States, the industry\u2019s biggest single market, were worth 1 billion pounds ($1.23 billion) last year.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump addresses a joint news conference with Finland's President Sauli Niinisto in East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., October 2, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that this dispute is about aircraft subsidies, our sector has been hit hard,\u201d the association\u2019s chief executive, Karen Betts, said in a statement, urging restraint from both sides.\n\nTARIFF TABLE TENNIS\n\nSpanish vintners said their wine would cost too much in U.S. stores if tariffs were confirmed.\n\n\u201cThe tariffs will affect our competitivity,\u201d said a spokesman for CECRV, the association for producers of Spanish wines such as Rioja and Cava.\n\nGermany\u2019s VDMA engineering association said it was disappointed the European Commission, the EU executive, had not defused the row. \u201cThe current situation resembles a table tennis match,\u201d said VDMA trade expert Ulrich Ackermann.\n\nSpanish olives, British sweaters and woollens, and German tools and coffee were targeted in addition to British whisky and French wine.\n\nCheese from nearly every EU country will also be hit with the 25% tariffs, but Italian wine and olive oil were spared, along with European chocolate.\n\n\u201cDairy products are going to be directly hit ... we are going to fight for these measures to be delayed,\u201d said Michel Nalet, spokesman for France\u2019s Lactalis group, the world\u2019s biggest dairy firm, which makes butter and cheeses under the President label.\n\nThe U.S.-based Cheese Importers Association of America said it would challenge a decision by the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office to skip offering a grace period for goods that were already in transit when the tariffs took effect.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nThere was relief for some who had expected to be drawn into the row but were not.\n\nShares in European luxury goods, including British fashion brand Burberry (BRBY.L), and drinks companies, such as France\u2019s Remy Cointreau (RCOP.PA), rose on Thursday, after the tariffs excluded cognac, champagne and leather goods.\n\nOne person familiar with the case said the U.S. Trade Representative was deliberately not using the full extent of WTO-approved ruling to coax the EU into negotiations.\n\nAirbus and U.S. firm Boeing Co (BA.N), the world\u2019s two largest planemakers, have waged a war of attrition over subsidies at the WTO since 2004. The dispute has tested the trade policeman\u2019s influence and is expected to set the tone for competition from would-be rivals from China.", "description": "President Donald Trump hailed a \"nice victory\" on Thursday after the United States got the green light to place tariffs on European Union goods in a dispute over EU aircraft subsidies.", "authors": ["Kate Holton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436784298&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920XH", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
