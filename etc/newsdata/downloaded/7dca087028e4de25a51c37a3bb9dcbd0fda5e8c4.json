There is no justifiable excuse for someone responding to Hipgrave with such inappropriate comments.\n\nExamples of the abuse Hipgrave received on Twitter following her tweet about Messi's penalty\n\nAlthough unaware that it would become one of the week\u2019s major talking points, there is no reason she should regret bringing it to public attention. Instead, it is for Twitter to put appropriate controls in place.\n\nIf the organisation can involve the police when it comes to racist abuse, they should be just as pro-active with sexist comments.\n\nHipgrave does not stand alone. Countless female TV presenters have had similar experiences after posting an observation on a public platform. Sadly, Twitter\u2019s 305million active users prefer to ignore these issues rather than confront them.\n\nIt has not been an easy week for Hipgrave, with various TV programmes, newspapers (including this one) and magazines asking her to speak on the issue. So far, she has declined them all.\n\nIn the past, like most women in an environment dominated by males, she has ignored the regular Twitter abuse telling her to \u2018get back into the kitchen\u2019.\n\nBy working with former professional footballers Hipgrave knows that the laddish culture of the dressing room is soon transferred to the green room when ex-players get together.\n\nHipgrave, pictured with Ian Wright, centre, and Peter Taylor, right, works as a presenter for BT Sport and co-hosts a BBC Radio 5 Live show with Danny Baker\n\nThe 36-year-old retweeted the worst of the abuse for her 27,000 Twitter followers before posting this message\n\nHaving previously worked with Hipgrave, who was hosting Thursday night\u2019s Europa League coverage on BT Sport, she is not a woman who is easily offended. She grew up in Newcastle in a household dominated by talk of the Kevin Keegan team that nearly won the Premier League in the mid-Nineties.\n\nAt weekends she would go with her dad to reserve team games at St James\u2019 Park, or to watch her brother playing for Blaydon Youth.\n\nWhen it comes to football she is passionate and would certainly prefer to be remembered for her skills as a TV presenter rather than as a glamorous pin-up.\n\nIn terms of her professional approach to her broadcasting career, you would be hard pushed to find anyone who works harder on preparation and research.\n\nUnwittingly, Hipgrave has forced attention on to the issue of sexist abuse. It is something for which she should be saluted. Without it, the rogues who ruin the Twitter experience win hands down.\n\nArnesen chases United role\n\nFrank Arnesen has not worked in English football since leaving Chelsea in 2010, but his name has come up again as the Glazers consider a reshuffle at Manchester United.\n\nEd Woodward, the executive vice chairman, has no intention of giving up handling player recruitment, but Arnesen, 59, is nothing if not a charmer when it comes to talking himself into jobs.\n\nFrank Arnesen has not worked in English football since leaving Chelsea in 2010\n\nWoodward has handled all major transfer activity since replacing David Gill, but the appointment of a technical director at United is still a possibility.\n\nArnesen\u2019s reputation took a battering as sporting director at Chelsea, where his relationship with Jose Mourinho was never on an even keel.\n\nMourinho\u2019s resolve to land the United job in the summer will be something Arnesen needs to work on if he is to convince the Glazers to hire him.\n\nThe financial commitment to Chelsea\u2019s youth academy by club owner Roman Abramovich shows no sign of slowing up after work began on a new indoor centre at the club\u2019s training ground.\n\nChelsea, under pressure from Manchester City, Barcelona and Real Madrid for the world\u2019s best youngsters, expect the facelift to be completed before the start of next season.\n\nReferee Bobby Madley responded to player power at Selhurst Park when he awarded Watford captain Troy Deeney a 16th-minute penalty last Saturday.\n\nDeeney told Madley to watch Palace midfielder Mile Jedinak holding him before the corner kick was taken, an incident that led to the referee correctly giving Quique Sanchez Flores\u2019 team the chance to score from the spot.\n\nTroy Deeney celebrates after scoring a penalty for Watford against Crystal Palace on Saturday\n\nManchester City pulled out of a move to buy a mystery club in South America last month and have instead turned their attention to the rapidly growing football market in China.", "description": "NEIL ASHTON: Perhaps the most worrying aspect of Lynsey Hipgrave\u2019s brush with Twitter this week is that she should have regrets about highlighting the sexist abuse on her timeline.", "authors": ["Neil Ashton For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/18/21/315A4B1200000578-0-image-a-14_1455830200658.jpg", "published_at": "2016-02-18"}
