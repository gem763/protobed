In this undertaking, we have had a challenging balancing act, not only in ensuring that we deliver other services to residents and champion the interests of the poor, but also that we foster the creation of a business environment that spurs growth, and fights corruption in these tough economic times.\n\nTo achieve this, the scourge of corruption was, and is still, declared enemy number one within the city.\n\nWe implemented the Ethics programme and Security Vetting of City employees.\n\nThese programmes are continuing because they contribute towards the elimination of fraud and corruption, as well as improving good and ethical conduct, with high levels of integrity, by all employees.\n\nAmongst the challenges I inherited in Corporate and Shared Services, the department I am privileged to lead, were ageing ICT infrastructure, inadequate \u201cincentive\u201d mechanisms to support the performance management system as well as ethical lapses and corruption.\n\nIn our attempts at professionalising the workforce, we coined the term \u201cService with Pride\u201d which is part of an ongoing campaign aimed at instilling a particular approach to how officials carry out their duties.\n\nWe have had great success.\n\nThe recognised officials continue to perform even better than before, generally going beyond the call of duty, an effect being seen gradually across the city.\n\nAll these challenges did not deter us from delivering on our promise to the residents who made a clear demand for change of leadership in the city.\n\nIn fact, these challenges were our reality and we have had to fix a lot of things.\n\nWe put financial commitments to the goals of our political mandate on insourcing and were instilling a culture of prudent financial management, owing to the weak and failing economy under the ANC national and provincial governments.\n\nAll processes for the insourcing of both security and cleaning personnel are close to conclusion (apart from a few technical issues), and over 5000 employees and their families have benefitted greatly from normal employee benefits such as pension fund, medical aid, flexible working hours and an increased salary.\n\nThe success in the insourcing project has culminated in the city being recognised nationally as a model for insourcing.\n\nThis weekend over 1000 additional security guards will be undergoing the process of onboarding where their documents will be processed, so they can properly assume their duties on November 1 as the last group of insourced officials.\n\nOur objective to change the circumstances of the forgotten people of Johannesburg was realised through the insourcing project.\n\nThese colleagues will never be forgotten again.\n\nThey will no longer be exploited nor struggle with basic necessities.\n\nThe nine years of reckless mismanagement of the South African economy under former president Jacob Zuma and his then deputy and current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, taught us that a lack of economic growth hinders lasting development.\n\nIn our corner of the world we have made our contribution to growing the economy by increasing the availability of resources.\n\nWe would, obviously, wish to do more by increasing the number of skilled professionals we recruit, to help us optimise our agenda of professionalising the civil service, promoting good governance, improving transport and preserve resources for future generations despite the current challenges the city faces.\n\nIn the meantime, the employment of the security and cleaning personnel will provide security to the city\u2019s assets while the cleaning services will ensure that we operate in a clean and hygienic environment thus helping us with improved efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nAs this administration led by Mayor Mashaba approaches the end of its term of office, and with the 2021 local government elections advancing rapidly into sight, my colleagues and I approach the end knowing that history will be on our side.\n\nHistory will honour our efforts.\n\nThe City of Johannesburg is, and will always be, the first municipality in South Africa to roll out insourcing on this scale successfully.\n\nWe have delivered!\n\nThe success of the project is owed to the residents of Johannesburg, the city\u2019s dedicated staff, as well as our coalition and voting partners.\n\nDr Ntombi Khumalo is a DA Councillor and Member of the Mayoral Committee for Corporate and Shared Services in the City of Johannesburg", "description": "During a speech at his inauguration in May 1994, former president Nelson Mandela said: \u201cThe task at hand will not be easy, but you have mandated us to change South Africa from a land in which the majority lived with little hope, to one in which they", "authors": ["Ntombi Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/72/8532d44058a94a388d11c74d4cf3a0d9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
