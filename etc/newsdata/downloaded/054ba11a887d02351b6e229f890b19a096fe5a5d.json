These are problems that can only be solved by significant structural and cultural changes at MSNBC, NBC News, and its parent company, Comcast,\u201d said Shaunna Thomas, founder of the organization.\n\n\u201cThe DNC needs to make it clear that they support survivors of sexual abuse and cancel the upcoming 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate on MSNBC until Comcast and NBC News take clear steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks,\u201d she noted.\n\n\u201cThe DNC must stand with survivors and pull the upcoming Democratic presidential primary debate from MSNBC until Comcast takes clear steps to clean house at NBC News,\u201d Ms. Thomas added.\n\n\u201cClean house and do an independent investigation,\u201d she advised in a follow-up tweet.\n\nSo far, there has been no public reaction from either the Democratic group, the network or the newspaper.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
