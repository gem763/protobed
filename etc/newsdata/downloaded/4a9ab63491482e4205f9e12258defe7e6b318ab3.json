It faces uncertainty after the European Union (EU) in February began a process that could suspend the country\u2019s special trade preferences.\n\n\u201cThe minimum wage for textile, garment and shoe workers for 2020 is set at $190 per month,\u201d Labour Minister Ith Sam Heng said in a directive on Friday, adding that the new wage takes effect in January.\n\nCambodia benefits from the EU\u2019s \u201cEverything But Arms\u201d (EBA) trade programme, which allows the world\u2019s least-developed countries to export most goods to the EU free of duties.\n\nPav Sina, president of the Collective Union Movement of Workers, said unions would accept the new hike, although it fell short of their $195 demand, after a representative vote.\n\n\u201cEven though this figure is not what we wanted as our position, it is positive, as Cambodia is in the midst of uncertainties of the trade preferences,\u201d Sina said.\n\n\u201cIf our wage goes higher than countries in the region, we will also suffer,\u201d Sina said.\n\nThe EU, which accounts for more than one-third of Cambodia\u2019s exports, including garments, footwear and bicycles, in February began an 18-month consideration that could lead to the EBA suspension.\n\nThe re-examination of the European preferences began after the arrest of opposition leader Kem Sokha and the dissolution of his party, leading to longtime Prime Minister Hun Sen\u2019s party\u2019s holding all seats in parliament.\n\nKen Loo, Secretary General at the Garment Manufacturers Association of Cambodia (GMAC), said employers accepted the new minimum wage but were concerned about rising pay.\n\n\u201cWe are always worried ... we are always concerned about rising wages, but we also understand that we just have to go up in line with inflation and other factors,\u201d Loo told Reuters on Friday.", "description": "Cambodia on Friday raised next year's legal minimum wage for workers in its crucial textiles and footwear industry to $190 per month, an increase of 4.4%, amid pressure from the European Union over its human rights and political record, officials said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431902314&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0I4", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
