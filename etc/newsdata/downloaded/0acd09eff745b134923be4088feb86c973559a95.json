REUTERS/Adnan Abidi\n\nThere is a \u201cprima facie case for investigation\u201d against MakeMyTrip and Oyo for alleged violations of rules barring uncompetitive agreements between parties, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said in an order dated Oct. 28.\n\nThe order follows a complaint from the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI), an industry body.\n\nBoth Oyo and MakeMyTrip allow guests to book hotels through their mobile apps while charging hotels a fee on room revenue, but Oyo also franchises its brand and offers standardized amenities at hotels on its network.\n\nGurugram-headquartered Oyo, valued at $10 billion (\u00a37.78 billion) and one of the world\u2019s largest hotel chains, is already facing backlash from an increasing number of Indian hotel operators who are complaining about being blindsided by fee increases.\n\nThe backlash against Oyo has come at a sensitive time for its major investor SoftBank, which is struggling to close its second $100-billion plus Vision Fund and has faced challenges at some of its other marquee bets such as WeWork and Uber (UBER.N).\n\nWhile Uber has seen its valuation slide after a poor market debut in May, SoftBank has also had to endure a painful bailout of WeWork following a failed public listing.\n\nThe FHRAI said agreements between Oyo and Nasdaq-listed MakeMyTrip were restricting market access to Indian hotel chains such as Fab Hotels and Treebo, according to the CCI's order. (bit.ly/2MUhtcX)\n\n\u201c(MakeMyTrip) and OYO have entered into confidential commercial agreements wherein (MakeMyTrip) has agreed to give preferential treatment to OYO on its platform, further leading to a denial of market access to Treebo and Fab Hotels,\u201d the CCI\u2019s order said, quoting from the FHRAI\u2019s allegations.\n\nOyo said in a statement it was reviewing the order and would cooperate with the CCI\u2019s investigation.\n\n\u201cWe will co-operate with CCI and demonstrate that the allegations are unfounded,\u201d a MakeMyTrip spokeswoman said in an email.\n\nThe complaint from the FHRAI also included a long list of other allegations. It said Oyo and MakeMyTrip are hurting competition by offering deep discounts and charging \u201cexorbitant\u201d fees from hotels.\n\nOyo\u2019s prices in small Indian markets are about 30% lower than average industry prices, which helps it attract more customers at the cost of smaller, independent hotels which are then forced to join Oyo\u2019s network or lose out on potential revenues, the FHRAI said.\n\nHowever, the CCI said it would not provide a finding on the allegations around discounts and excessive commissions before investigating the \u201cmarket structure, entry conditions, cost structure of platforms\u201d in the industry.\n\n\u201cThere are no clear standards to determine what price is excessive or fair,\u201d it said.\n\nThe FHRAI had also alleged that Oyo and MakeMyTrip misled customers by continuing to list some hotels on their platforms with a \u201csold out\u201d sign even after the hotels asked the companies to sever ties.\n\nThe CCI said these allegations, in the case of MakeMyTrip, need to be investigated, but did not provide any finding against Oyo.", "description": "An Indian regulator has ordered an investigation into allegations that hotel-booking service MakeMyTrip Ltd gives special treatment to SoftBank-backed <9984.T> hotel chain Oyo on its platform, stifling competition in the industry.", "authors": ["Sachin Ravikumar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446220871&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1BA", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
