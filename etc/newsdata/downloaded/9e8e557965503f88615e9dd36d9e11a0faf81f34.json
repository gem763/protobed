But then there's this video of Jonathan Van Ness silently losing his mind over a personal phone call from Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThe Emmy-winning Queer Eye star declared (or in his words, \"accidentally splurted out\") his support for the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate during his podcast Getting Curious, while interviewing Planned Parenthood\u2019s acting president and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson.\n\nIt seems Warren was informed, as she made a call to Van Ness to personally thank him \u2014 a chat JVN had recorded and then posted to Instagram.\n\nIt's seriously one of the most delightful things you'll watch today.\n\n\"I'm glad we're going to be in this fight together, side-by-side. I love the endorsement, and for all the right reasons,\" says Warren, as Van Ness tries to contain his glee.\n\n\"Well, you know, I have to tell you, what I realised, it was at the last debates, and I was like, this health insurance industry is a fuckin' racket!\" says Van Ness. \"I've had enough! And then I was like, it's all about you ... I'm Team Warren.\"\n\nIt's two minutes and 45 seconds that will truly make your day.\n\nDescribing the moment he endorsed Warren on the podcast, Van Ness said he \"splurted out\" his allegiance, but that then he was \"just going with it, it's the time to just go with it.\"\n\nSEE ALSO: Sophie Turner and Jonathan Van Ness shading that 'Game of Thrones' ending will make your day\n\nThen, the two have a quick talk about the state of affordable healthcare in the U.S. and of course, the invitation to appear on the podcast was extended, and can this please happen?\n\n\"Go save America!\" Van Ness tells Warren.\n\nBest bit? Warren also filmed the call.\n\nThank you for your support, @jvn! Shoulder to shoulder, we\u2019re going to fight for #MedicareForAll. No one should be able to make a profit off of denying people health care\u2014and together, we\u2019ll win. pic.twitter.com/8aF4Ut55jq \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 26, 2019\n\nVan Ness has plenty more to be excited about this week, with the release of his first book, Over the Top: A Raw Journey to Self-Love, hitting shelves on Wednesday.
