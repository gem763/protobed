He was diagnosed with right shoulder inflammation, didn\u2019t feel good after playing catch a month later and had an MRI on April 9 that revealed a strained latissimus dorsi muscle. He didn\u2019t throw off a mound again until a bullpen session on Aug. 9 and made minor league injury rehabilitation appearances on Sept. 1, 6 and 11, allowing seven runs - four earned - and 13 hits in 7 2/3 innings. He struck out 11 and walked none. A two-time All-Star, Severino was 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA in 32 starts last season and signed a $40 million, four-year contract, a deal that includes a 2023 team option and could be worth $52.25 million for five seasons. He has a 41-25 career record with a 3.51 ERA. New York\u2019s magic number is two over Cleveland to clinch a playoff berth and three over Tampa Bay for the Yankees\u2019 first AL East title since 2012.\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nReds right-hander Sonny Gray faces Cubs right-hander Yu Darvish at Wrigley Field in a matchup of two of baseball\u2019s best pitchers since the All-Star break. Gray is 4-1 with a 1.29 ERA in his last eight starts, returning to form in his first year with Cincinnati after he was acquired in a trade with the New York Yankees. Darvish struck out 14 while pitching six scoreless innings in a 4-1 victory at San Diego on Thursday. He has a 2.44 ERA in 11 starts since the break, striking out 93 and walking six during that stretch.\n\nK KORNER\n\nHouston\u2019s Justin Verlander has 275 strikeouts going into Tuesday\u2019s start against Texas, 17 behind the Astros\u2019 Gerrit Cole. They can become the second teammates to strike out 300 in a season after Arizona\u2019s Randy Johnson (334) and Curt Schilling (316) in 2002.\n\nCOLD BATS\n\nThe Diamondbacks have tumbled to the rear of the NL wild card race because their bats have gone cold. Arizona scored just 14 runs over nine games from Sept. 7-15, which led to a 2-7 record during that span. They\u2019ll try to keep their longshot playoff hopes alive on Tuesday when left-hander Alex Young takes the mound. He\u2019s had a good rookie season, with a 7-4 record and 3.38 ERA. The 26-year-old set a club rookie record with 12 strikeouts against the Reds on Sept. 7\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors Tuesday:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/reds_mariners_baseball_22700_c0-169-4043-2526_s1770x1032.jpg?143a06a45004dce111f94bc4283784456af5ed80", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
