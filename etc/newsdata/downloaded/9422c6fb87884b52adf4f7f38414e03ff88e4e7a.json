Gaspard wouldn't identify the worker or say who employed him.\n\n\"Look, Papo, 'the best engineering!' Look at these large stretches (between supports) and s--t beams! (unintelligible) They're already to the point of breaking,\" the worker says in Spanish in the video.\n\n\"Look at how it's bent already! They couldn't remove it because it's too bent and it has too much pressure. The huge spaces without beams \u2013 look! What a very s--t structure these architects and engineers are building! \u2026 This is seriously bad, Papa!\"\n\nGaspard said he's been told workers had been removing the temporary posts and \"when they got to less and less of them, got more and more load on 'em, they tried to tell the contractor to stop but were told to keep going.\n\n\"What it shows is that the concrete deck has so much deflection that they can't remove the shore posts,\" Gaspard said. \"They have so much load on them, it's bending them.\"\n\nNew Orleans Fire Department Superintendent Tim McConnell told WWL Wednesday that officials are aware of the video and that it's become a piece of evidence in the investigation.\n\nFederal investigators with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration began their work Saturday, within hours of the accident. The agency's inspectors were given New Orleans police body cameras to document the hotel ruins.\n\nMcConnell said any decision on whether to pursue criminal charges over the building's collapse, or the resulting deaths and injuries, would depend on what OSHA finds.\n\nOne foreman for a subcontractor on the project, who said he was off Saturday, described another flaw. He claimed contractors failed to properly install the metal pan that concrete is poured into for the building's floors.\n\nThat corrugated metal decking was positioned differently along the edge of the building above one street than elsewhere on the building. Metal sheets were meant to overlap, but instead were installed perpendicularly, the worker said -- something he suspected caused a \"shearing point\" and may have contributed to the collapse.\n\nA former ironworker who requested anonymity under the advice of his attorney said he agreed with that theory and blamed a series of changes in the design that were made during construction.\n\n\"It wasn't the ironworkers. We did everything to engineered specs. I wondered if the engineers were really OK with it,\" said the former worker. \"The whole crew joked about how bad it was. We all joked we'd never stay in that hotel.\"\n\nThe firms involved in the project declined to speculate about the cause of the collapse.\n\nBrian Trascher, a spokesman for the contractor on the hotel project, Metairie, Louisiana-based Citadel Builders, questioned the origin of the video and cautioned against drawing any conclusions from it.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of Monday-morning quarterbacking going on, a lot of people trying to flex their engineering muscles because this happened,\" he said.\n\nTrascher said top experts have been brought in to assess the collapse, including some who worked on the 9/11 World Trade Center collapse and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.\n\n\"These people don't live on Facebook for a living, they do this kind of a thing for a living, and I think we're going to follow their advice,\" Trascher said.\n\nThe principal engineer on the project, Heaslip Engineering, issued a statement Wednesday that described the firm as \"devastated\" by the collapse. James Heaslip, the firm's founder, didn't speculate in the statement over what caused the collapse.\n\n\"As a member of the design team, we are keenly interested in finding out why this incident occurred,\" the statement from founder James Heaslip read.\n\nYet another theory came from a Texas engineer who inspects bridges for that state.\n\nLinwood \"Woody\" Howell, of Austin, pointed to a \"scissor lift\" from drone footage of the hotel wreckage. The video and other photos show the heavy lift propped up on a pile of rubble.\n\nThat Genie 1930 model weighs nearly 3,000 pounds, and Howell suspected that, like a stiletto heel, its weight could have pierced a concrete floor that was supported by only \"point shores\" like those shown in the worker's video, and not by beams that would have distributed the weight more evenly.\n\nHowell said his rough calculations based on project drawings and specs from the maker of the steel decking indicated \"the floor system design was pushing the structural limits of product capability, leaving little tolerance for error.\"\n\n\"If the scissor lift failed one section of the top floor, then the falling weight of the floor and scissor lift would collapse floors below and eventually buckle columns and pull down areas adjacent to the failed section,\" Howell said. \"This scenario is consistent with the video of collapse and other currently available data.\"\n\nAnother construction expert suggested all the problems described to WWL could have been factors in the collapse.", "description": "\"This is seriously bad,\" one worker is heard saying in the video purporting to show the condition of the half-built Hard Rock Cafe hotel in New Orleans before it collapsed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/12/e154a97b-eec4-4a7a-b81d-87eee43b971d/thumbnail/1200x630/bc62d264bdc181a58260f46be32e46dd/cbsn-fusion-hard-rock-hotel-partially-collapses-in-new-orleans-thumbnail-370696-640x360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
