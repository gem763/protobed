But crypto does not play by these rules. It seems the market is just now starting to heat up after a relatively sleepy August, and YouHodler is heating up along with it.\n\nAugust saw a wealth of new features for traders and Hodlers alike. Updates to turbo loans, PDL extend, trading charts, a USDT savings account and more were all welcome additions to the platform. If you missed those original announcements, we\u2019re here to fill you in on what happened in August and also give a glimpse into the near future.\n\nTraders discover how to profit in a bear market with YouHodler\n\nEven though the market may not reflect big profits, August was a big month for traders on YouHodler. This is mainly due to them discovering YouHodler\u2019s wealth of new features that can help one succeed in both bear and bull markets. Take TurboLoans for example.\n\nTurbo Loans let user\u2019s offer up crypto as collateral in exchange for a fiat loan. Yet, instead of ending the transaction there as one would with a traditional loan, YouHodler users that fiat to buy more crypto which is then used as collateral for another loan. This \u201cchain of loans,\u201d as it is called, can be automated up to 5 times and can help users buy more crypto for a cheaper price.\n\nAside from Turbo Loans and multiplying crypto, YouHodler also has flexible options for traders that want to hedge in a bear market. The platform\u2019s long term loan plans give users fair LTV ratios and up to 120 days before needing to pay back the loan. This gives the use plenty of capital (and time) to hedge their portfolio and prepare for the next uptrend. Customizable loan terms are also available upon request.\n\nYouHodler introduces \u2018margin trading suite\u2019 to platform\n\nFor those that want to do more complex and interactive trades, YouHodler\u2019s new margin trading features can help one use leverage and multiply their crypto. Here is a quick snapshot of all things margin trading on YouHolder:\n\n0 Rollover Fees \u2013 Unlike other exchanges that charge rollover fees every 4, 8 or 24 hours, YouHodler charges 0% on rollover fees or margin trading fees. Users only pay the interest fee on their plan of choice (e.g. 7% for a 30 day loan term on YouHodler\u2019s \u201cBull Run\u201d loan plan). This is far more affordable in the long term than rollover fees from an exchange.\n\nExtend PDL: Extend the Price Down Limit, (a.k.a Margin Call Level) on a loan and reduce risk in the event of a price drop.\n\nMultiply crypto 5x: Efficiently and easily take a loan from YouHodler to go long or shot on any of our available currency pairs up to 5x. The process, called Turbo Loans, is automated and can be done in a click of a button.\n\nNew trading charts: Trading charts integrated into each coin wallet showing, 1 hour, 24 hour, 7 day, 30 days, 90 and 120 day time frames.\n\nAttractive platform interface: Traders can easily manage their positions with YouHodler\u2019s user friendly and interactive trading platform with features such as Extend PDL (margin call), Close Now, Reopen, Increase LTV and more.\n\nFlexible borrowing limits: Individual loan plans are available upon request. All you have to do is ask\n\nHODL smarty with a USDT Savings Account\n\nFor Hodlers that are looking to take part in low risk hodling, then YouHodler\u2019s new USDT Savings Account is an innovative option to consider. Available for all YouHodler clients, USDT Savings Account lets users deposit USDT into a wallet that YouHodler states will grow up to 12% per year.\n\nAlso related to USDT news, the platform now fully accepts both ERC-20 based USDT and Omni-based USDT for maximum client convenience.\n\nYouHodler CEO Ilya Volkov states \u201cWe\u2019re happy to follow our valuable customer\u2019s demand and make this additional step in order to build a \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d for all HODLer\u2019s needs and a fully functional \u201ccrypto-fiat\u201d Fin-tech platform.\u201d\n\nThe crypto market is warming up fast and so is YouHodler!
