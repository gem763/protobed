Decarbonising the electricity supply can be done with a mixture of renewables and maybe a dash of nuclear. Decarbonising domestic heating is the biggest challenge and will cost half a trillion pounds.\n\nThe technologies we need to do it already exist and there\u2019s every chance that new better ones will emerge. As we move towards 2050, successive governments will have to back several horses to make sure it\u2019s not locked into any one path. Some of those bets may fail.\n\nThe task, then, is daunting but not impossible. But there are some inconvenient truths that this analysis and the targets the government has set ignores.\n\nFirstly, international aviation is not included in the net zero target. It\u2019s estimated that the UK\u2019s share of aviation may make up as much as 7% of the UK\u2019s total emissions.\n\nAnd secondly, the way we currently measure emissions does not include the environmental cost of the goods we import.\n\nIf the UK were to close down a carbon-hungry steel plant, our emissions would go down. But we still need steel so we would import it - from China, say, where it\u2019s made in a more carbon and energy-intensive way.\n\nSo actually while the emissions produced on UK soil go down, the UK\u2019s carbon footprint goes up.\n\nDieter Helm, the author of a government cost-of-energy review argues we cannot ignore our overall consumption.\n\n\u201cWe have to be brutally honest,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is one of the reasons why despite everything the people in Europe and the UK have been doing, we haven't made an iota of difference to climate change.\u201d\n\nHelm points out that even a relatively small country such as Denmark, with a population of 5.8 million, has increased its carbon consumption. The increase in the carbon intensity of its imports has far outweighed the reduction in emissions it made through uptake of renewable energy.\n\nConcentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has continued to rise every single year since 1990 despite 30 years of low emissions targets in the West.\n\n\u201cYou have to address the incentives which lie in China, India and Africa,\u201d says Helm. \u201cThese countries are doubling in size every 10 years in economic input. This is where climate change is going to be determined and we should not have a policy which positively incentivises them to substitute our home production with more carbon intensive output.\u201d\n\nThat sounds like a counsel of despair. The UK is responsible for just 1% of global CO2 emissions. Even if we spend a trillion pounds getting our net emissions to zero it won\u2019t make any difference \u2013 so why bother?\n\nBaroness Brown says the UK has a moral responsibility to lead, because it has profited so much from emitting CO2 over the years.\n\n\u201cWe like to claim that we are the cradle of the industrial revolution. So actually we have a huge responsibility for historic emissions. We should be prepared to make a strong statement now.\u201d\n\nBut if, as Baroness Brown points out, we became rich the dirty way, can we really say with any authority that others should do things differently now? Helm says no.\n\n\u201cPreaching to developing countries how they should mend their ways when we've caused much of the problem\u2026 is never going to cut it. It's arrogant, it's morally unacceptable and it smacks of imperialism.\u201d\n\nInstead, he suggests that the UK - and the West - should provide the means by which the world\u2019s fastest growing economies can decarbonise.\n\nThe biggest of these is China, whose $13tn economy is growing at 6% per year. It\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest burner of coal, but it\u2019s also the biggest global investor in renewables.\n\nEmma Pinchbeck from Renewables UK is optimistic about China\u2019s willingness to adopt low-carbon technology. She thinks that as the country\u2019s \u201cmegacities\u201d grow, poor air quality and poor quality of living will create political pressure to tackle the issue.\n\n\u201cThe availability of low carbon technology means they may just go straight there. Do not underestimate the visible benefits of low carbon living in the industrial world skipping straight to industrialised economies.\u201d\n\nPanda-shaped solar panels, Datong power plant, China Panda-shaped solar panels, Datong power plant, China\n\nThe UK has proved it is possible to grow your economy while reducing emissions. It\u2019s also shown it can lead in green technology adoption.\n\nAs well as its leading position in offshore wind, the UK\u2019s particular history and geography means it is well placed to lead in carbon capture and storage (CCS), a process which extracts the carbon from fossil fuels the moment they're burned.\n\nThat carbon is then stored securely underground in depleted oil and gas fields. - which by happy coincidence we have right on our doorstep in the North Sea. Many think it is impossible to hit the zero carbon target without developing this technology.\n\nBeing in the vanguard of these methods will create industries and expertise the rest of the world will need. It could be a massive export opportunity.\n\nImagine a world in which renewable power is used to charge a small number of shared electric cars - which double as energy storage units - while also being used to make hydrogen to supplement electric heating systems for well-insulated homes of citizens who eat very little meat and have international travel rationed, with everything managed by optimised networks powered by artificial intelligence (while the humans plant a lot of trees).\n\nIt\u2019s a massive environmental, economic, societal and moral journey - and it may be a lonely one.\n\nWe need to get moving \u2013 down several paths \u2013 some of which will turn out to be less successful than others.\n\nIt will be very very expensive.\n\nBut not as expensive as a climate catastrophe.", "description": "", "authors": ["Simon Jack"], "top_image": "https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/extra/shorthand/assets/news/DmZ6C9zSsR/assets/33gyzRuRrZ/road-1920x1080.jpeg"}
