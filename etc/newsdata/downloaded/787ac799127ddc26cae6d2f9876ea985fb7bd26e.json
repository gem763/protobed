That proved to be the case once again with \u201cHustlers\u201d: according to STX, the studio behind the movie, 67% of the opening weekend audience consisted of women, and 65% were people of color.\n\nA new study released Wednesday by the same UCLA team aims to outline best practices to guide industry leaders in actually ensuring better diversity and representation, particularly in behind-the-camera roles and in positions of power.\n\nWhile many individual film and TV stars and creators have championed their own efforts to elevate marginalized voices, the perennial studies on diversity and representation have noted that it requires an industrywide effort to change practices and institutions.\n\nThrough examining existing diversity and inclusion programs in the entertainment industry, and conducting interviews with industry gatekeepers, like studio executives, talent agents and union leaders, the UCLA researchers developed five key recommendations, summed up in an acronym: MEANS.\n\nMODERNIZE your worldview to reflect changing U.S. demographics EXPAND the net in routine talent searches AMPLIFY the voices of women, especially women of color,\n\nwithin organizations NORMALIZE compensation practices to reduce barriers to entry for marginalized groups STRUCTURE incentives for decision makers to prioritize diversity and inclusion\n\nWithin each recommendation, they identify concrete practices, such as setting clear and measurable goals and timelines for inclusive hiring, and holding trainings to reduce unconscious bias in evaluating job candidates.\n\nEarlier this month, a study from the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative similarly emphasized reforming hiring and casting practices.\n\nOther recommendations from the UCLA team include ensuring people in power advocate for and \u201csponsor\u201d promising women, especially women of color.\n\nAs one executive interviewed by the researchers explained, \u201cSponsorship is when you actually have someone speaking for you and touting you in a room that you\u2019re not present in.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the interviewees also stressed retention, such as actually committing to hiring candidates who were brought on through a diversity initiative, and then paying them fairly and providing a supportive environment.\n\nThe researchers warned that each individual practice or policy change isn\u2019t a panacea. Instead, they have to be implemented in tandem with the others, and leaders and institutions have to treat representation as a holistic problem that requires systemic change.\n\n\u201cThere is no silver bullet for solving Hollywood\u2019s longstanding diversity and inclusion problem. Instead, organizations truly committed to change must holistically address the problem with a toolkit of practices,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cIf Hollywood storytelling is to become a truer reflection of a diversifying American mainstream, the industry must widely adopt these means as part of a new normal.\u201d", "description": "Researchers at UCLA have developed a set of best practices for Hollywood leaders and gatekeepers to commit to long-term, industrywide changes.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d81440d24000012277d548d.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
