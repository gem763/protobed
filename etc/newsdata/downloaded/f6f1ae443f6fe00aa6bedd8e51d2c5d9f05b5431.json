Hours later, a YouTube video surfaced of Gillis and fellow comedian Matt McCusker discussing an unidentified city's Chinatown neighborhood.\n\nAt one point, Gillis asked: \u201cWhy do the f---ing c---ks live there?\u201d before complaining that Chinese restaurants are full of \"f---ing Chinese. ... And the translation between you and the waiter is just such a f---ing hassle.\" He also said he was more annoyed by hearing an Asian trying to learn English when he's eating out than by any other \"minority\" playing music. He characterized that reaction as \"nice racism, good racism,\" adding that whites would be a similar target if they were speaking English \"over there,\" not specifying where he meant.\n\nEarly Saturday, Page Six reported that Gillis had described Yang as a \"Jew c---k\" on a podcast hosted by fellow comedians Luis J. Gomez and Zac Amico.\n\nANDREW YANG PROMISES 10 RANDOM FAMILIES $12G EACH IN HOUSTON DEBATE SURPRISE\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, Gillis offered to apologize \"to anyone who's actually offended by anything I've said.\"\n\n\"I'm a comedian who pushes boundaries,\" the statement began. \"I sometimes miss. If you go through my 10 years of comedy, most of it bad, you're going to find a lot of bad misses ... My intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYang retweeted Gillis\u2019 statement Saturday and responded: \u201cShane - I prefer comedy that makes people think and doesn\u2019t take cheap shots. But I\u2019m happy to sit down and talk with you if you\u2019d like.\"\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, the presidential candidate added: \u201cFor the record, I do not think he should lose his job. We would benefit from being more forgiving rather than punitive. We are all human.\u201d", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said Saturday that he does not believe that controversial new \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member Shane Gillis should lose his job over his use of an anti-Chinese slur, adding that he was \"happy to sit down and talk\" with the comedian.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/POLS-Andrew-Yang.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
