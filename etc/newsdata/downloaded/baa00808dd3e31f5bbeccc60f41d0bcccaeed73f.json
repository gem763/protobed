Cupich of Chicago, who will lead the nearly 200 bishops through three days of discussions and listening sessions addressing the clergy sexual abuse scandal, which has shaken the Roman Catholic Church to its foundation. He evaded questions on the topic of gay priests and their adult victims three times during a press conference Monday in Rome.\n\nThe summit schedule, titled \u201cFor the Protection of Minors in the Church,\u201d was announced during the press conference, where American conservative critics noted a glaring omission in the subject matter.\n\n\u201cWill the problem of homosexuality among the clergy be addressed as part of this problem?\u201d Diane Montagna, Vatican correspondent for LifeSiteNews, pointedly asked Cardinal Cupich while noting that most victims of clerics are male.\n\nThe cardinal demurred and instead cited statistics showing that the number of abuse claims against priests has fallen since the early 2000s.\n\n\u201cIf, in fact, [as] you say, there is homosexuality within the priesthood, you can see already that it is not as a result of being homosexual that you abuse,\u201d Cardinal Cupich said.\n\nPope Francis\u2019 unprecedented summit begins just days after the Vatican\u2019s announcement that former Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, the onetime archbishop of Washington, had been defrocked as punishment for decades of sexual misconduct and abuse against seminarians and other male congregants. He is the highest-ranking clergyman to be stripped of his ministry amid the church\u2019s scandal.\n\nThe Vatican announced the summit in September, forcing American bishops to cancel plans for a meeting among themselves to address the U.S. facet of the global church scandal.\n\nThe announcement followed a tumultuous summer as reports detailed Mr. McCarrick\u2019s history of abuse with accounts from two of his accusers; a Pennsylvania grand jury report on 301 predatory priests, their more than 1,000 victims and church leaders\u2019 efforts to dismiss or cover up their crimes over decades; and a letter from a former Vatican diplomat who alleged \u201chomosexual networks\u201d within the highest offices of the Roman Catholic Church and accused the pope himself of ignoring the issue.\n\nFrancis\u2019 summit is bringing together representatives of bishop conferences around the globe and cardinals and members of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Soon after its announcement, a Vatican spokesman said the meeting would address abuse against minors and \u201cvulnerable adults,\u201d a term often used to refer to people under the church\u2019s custody, including seminarians.\n\nConservative U.S. Catholics made a point of that terminology in questioning Cardinal Cupich at Monday\u2019s press conference in Rome.\n\n\u201cWhen this meeting was initially announced, it was to be about the protection of minors and vulnerable adults, but now it seems to be about protection of minors only,\u201d said Edward Pentin, Rome correspondent for National Catholic Register. \u201cWill this meeting include abuse of vulnerable adults, seminarians in particular?\u201d\n\nThe cardinal said the summit would be more successful by focusing on one issue at a time.\n\nEach day of the summit will focus on a different topic: \u201cresponsibility\u201d on Thursday, \u201caccountability\u201d on Friday, \u201ctransparency\u201d on Saturday \u2014 and feature presentations and victim speakers. The gathering will culminate after Saturday evening Mass with a message from the pope.\n\nInitial hopes to produce universal directives for bishops around the world regarding accusations of sexual abuse by priests increasingly have been abandoned, as Francis and other church leaders have sought to downplay expectations in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cI think that the pope has this sort of innate Jesuitical modesty \u2014 the higher the expectations, the greater the frustration,\u201d Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta said at Monday\u2019s press conference. \u201c\n\nA follow-up meeting would be \u201cof the essence,\u201d Archbishop Scicluna added.\n\n\u201cThe reality is this is a very tired, unsuccessful attempt to conflate the issue of sexuality with pedophilia and sexual abuse,\u201d said Marianne Duddy-Burke, executive director of DignityUSA, a pro-LGBTQ Catholic organization. \u201cThis is actually an issue of abuse, power, unhealthy expression of sex, and it\u2019s an issue of access.\u201d\n\nA host of issues\n\nBeyond the issue of gays in the clergy, there are concerns about church leaders\u2019 commitment to the summit\u2019s title issue: protecting children.\n\nVatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti acknowledged this week to The New York Times that the church hierarchy has long applied a secret set of guidelines for dealing with clerics who father children. The admission came in response to a report by the newspaper.\n\nThe Vatican spokesman said the guidelines require errant priests to leave the clergy and care for their children, but The Times\u2019 report quoted an Irish psychotherapist who didn\u2019t learn that his father was a priest until he was in his 20s.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley of Boston expressed concern at a 2017 meeting of top church officials that the Vatican was reneging on its \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy on sexual abuse of minors.\n\nA papal panel canceled the defrocking of priests who had been convicted of abusing children and reduced other punishments for similarly guilty clergymen, The Journal reported.\n\n\u201cIf this gets out, it will cause a scandal,\u201d Cardinal O\u2019Malley told Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin and other Vatican officials, The Journal reported, citing a person who attended the meeting. The Vatican did nothing to address the issue.\n\nThose revelations follow Francis\u2019 acknowledgment last month of the long-concealed sexual abuse of nuns by priests and various Catholic dioceses across the U.S. and the release of names of hundreds of priests credibly accused of sexual misconduct over the decades.\n\nMeanwhile, attorneys general in several states have opened investigations of predator priests and church leaders\u2019 cover-ups and have identified sex-related crimes by clergy perpetrated over many years.\n\n\u201cI hope the summit can do something,\u201d said Catholic University theology professor Christopher J. Ruddy. \u201cIf, however, it\u2019s an attempt by the Vatican to keep control of something and avoid difficult issues, I think that\u2019s a real problem.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
