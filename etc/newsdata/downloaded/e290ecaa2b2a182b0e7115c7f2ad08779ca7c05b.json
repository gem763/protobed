The Food and Drug Administration said it is examining more than 150 vaping product samples for clues. People who have become ill have reported using a range of products and substances, including those containing THC and nicotine together and separately. THC is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.\n\n\u201cI wish we had more answers,\u201d said Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a single exposure or multiple, and I think a variety of hypotheses are being considered.\u201d\n\nThe FDA has tapped its Office of Criminal Investigations to help with the analysis and to pursue leads without prosecuting individuals for use of illicit products, said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products.\n\nThe OCI has been involved from the beginning of the FDA\u2019s investigation and is focusing on the product supply chain and attempting to identify what is making people sick, according to Mr. Zeller.\n\n\u201cWe are in desperate need of facts and answers to questions,\u201d Mr. Zeller said. \u201cGetting to the bottom of these respiratory illnesses is a top priority.\u201d\n\nThe FDA is also encouraging the public to submit detailed reports of any health or products issues through their online safety reporting portal.\n\nThe FDA and the CDC have previously warned consumers not to purchase illicit vaping products or modify the products that they have purchased legally.\n\nAs the investigation continues, Jennifer Layden, chief medical officer at the Illinois Department of Public Health, says that the department has had increased success in conducting interviews with patients to determine what products they have been using. The department is also asking anyone in the state who has recently vaped to fill out an anonymous form about their vaping habits to help aid the investigation.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nA large percentage of illnesses have been in young people, reflecting the popularity of vaping among youth. New data released this week show that the rate of teens vaping nicotine has grown sharply again in the past year, suggesting that marketing and sales restrictions meant to curb youth use haven\u2019t been substantial enough.\n\nTwo-thirds of the patients are between 18 and 34 years old, and 16% are under the age of 18, according to the CDC. More than half are under 25 years old. Nearly three-fourths of the patients who have developed vaping-associated lung illnesses so far are male.\n\nMales are more likely to use e-cigarettes than females, investigators said, but the gender gap among those who are getting sick is wider than the gap among those who vape in general.\n\nThe CDC activated its emergency operations center on Sept. 16 to further help investigate the illnesses.\n\nInvestigators say that the jump in cases is a mix of physicians reviewing older cases from the past several months and new cases that have occurred over the past week.\n\nThe seventh death, reported on Sept. 16, was a resident of Tulare County, Calif., the second death in the state. The male patient was over the age of 40 and had a history of vaping and smoking, according to the Tulare County Health & Human Services Agency.\n\nHis death hasn\u2019t yet been linked to any specific product, but the health agency noted that several cases of vaping-associated pulmonary injury have been associated with cannabis vaping products bought at pop-up shops.\n\nThe first death in California was reported on Sept. 6 in Los Angeles County. The state has had 73 potential cases of vaping-associated pulmonary illness, says the California Department of Public Health.\n\nDeaths have also been confirmed in Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota and Oregon.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health has reported 69 confirmed and probable cases, up from 52 the week before. All but one of the patients had to be hospitalized, says Ngozi Ezike, director of the department.\n\nThe rate of nicotine vaping doubled among middle- and high-school children between 2017 and 2019, according to Monitoring the Future, an annual survey of teen drug and alcohol use conducted by the University of Michigan.\n\nMore than one in four 12th-graders surveyed this year, or 25.4%, reported that they vaped nicotine within the past 30 days\u2014a measure of regular use. One in five, or 20.2%, of 10th-graders and one in 11, or 9%, of eighth-graders also reported regular nicotine vaping.\n\nMany show signs of addiction: 11.7% of 12th-graders, 6.9% of 10th-graders, and 1.9% of eighth-graders surveyed this year said they vape nicotine daily.\n\n\u201cWe know for certain that you develop addictions faster to nicotine when you\u2019re a teenager than when you\u2019re an adult,\u201d said Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which funds the Monitoring the Future survey. \u201cYou require it more intensely in a shorter period of time.\u201d\n\nRestrictions on sales and marketing, crackdowns by school officials, and perhaps greater awareness by teens of the dangers of vaping all appear to have had some effect. Growth in the rate of teens vaping nicotine slowed in 2019 after an explosive rise in 2018, but the continued rise is still extremely worrisome, says Dr. Volkow.\n\nThe percentage of 12th-graders vaping nicotine in the past 30 days rose 9.9 percentage points in 2018, and 4.5 percentage points in 2019, for example. For 10th-graders, it rose 7.9 percentage points in 2018 and 4.1 percentage points in 2019. However, the percentage of eighth-graders vaping nicotine regularly climbed slightly, rising 2.6 percentage points in 2018 and 2.8 percentage points in 2019.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about it as a risk factor for lifelong addiction, it\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d said Vin Gupta, an assistant professor and pulmonologist at the University of Washington.\n\nData on the rate of teens vaping THC-containing products from the Monitoring the Future survey will be published in December, according to Dr. Volkow.\n\nWrite to Betsy McKay at betsy.mckay@wsj.com", "description": "The number of confirmed or probable cases of vaping-associated pulmonary illness has risen to 530 across 38 states and one U.S. territory, the CDC reported Thursday, and a federal official disclosed that a criminal probe is under way.", "authors": ["Brianna Abbott", "Betsy Mckay", "Brianna.Abbott Wsj.Com", "Betsy.Mckay Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108777/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
