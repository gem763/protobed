And No, He's Not the Worst One.", "language": "en", "text": "Sean Spicer has lived to dance another week. The former Trump White House press secretary has been struggling through the \"Dancing with the Stars\" competition this season. His salsa was wooden, his tango was robotic, and Monday night's cha cha dedicated to \"Saturday Night Fever\" for Movie Night was \"Monday Night Lukewarm,\" as head judge Len Goodman put it.\n\nWell, judge Carrie Ann Inaba did have something positive to say about Spicer's performance.\n\n\"You smile from the moment you start to the moment you finish,\" she offered.\n\nDespite the mostly harsh comments, and even harsher scores (Spicer and his partner Lindsay Arnold earned only 15 out of 30 for their cha cha), he's still standing. It suggests he's hit some kind of a nerve with the viewers.\n\nYet, Spicer's critics are fuming that ABC producers let him dance in the first place.\n\n\"He lied every single day,\" former Olympic figure skater and \"Dancing with the Stars\" 2018 champion Adam Rippon complained.\n\n\"I know he was just doing his job, but he lied every single day,\" Rippon said, throwing in some profanity too.\n\nWhile Spicer is safe for another round, contestants to have left the competition so far include the legendary Supremes singer Mary Wilson and football veteran Ray Lewis, who was forced to leave the competition due to injury.\n\nNo, Sean cannot dance. But I agree with Carrie Ann - he's clearly having a blast.\n\nAnd honestly, I have to say he's not the worst dancer on the show. That title I have to give to basketball player Lamar Odom. His introductory dance with partner Peta Murgatroyd was painful. Painful. Perhaps the worst in the show's history. Certainly the worst foxtrot.\n\nBut again, a 10 for the grins!", "description": "Sean Spicer has lived to dance another week.
