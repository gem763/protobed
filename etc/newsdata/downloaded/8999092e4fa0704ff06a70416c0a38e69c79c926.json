Parker Song/Pool via REUTERS\n\nTensions over the disputed region of Kashmir have risen sharply since August, when India revoked the autonomy of its portion of the territory. Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan, who both claim it in full.\n\nXi told Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan during a meeting in Beijing that the rights and wrongs of the situation were clear, the report said.\n\n\u201cChina supports Pakistan to safeguard its own legitimate rights and hopes that the relevant parties can solve their disputes through peaceful dialogue,\u201d Xi said, according to Xinhua.\n\nThe Indian government\u2019s official spokesperson, Raveesh Kumar, said that his government had seen reports of the meeting, in response to a question from media about the issue.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s position has been consistent and clear that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. China is well aware of our position. It is not for other countries to comment on the internal affairs of India,\u201d he said.\n\nXi is scheduled to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Chennai later this week.\n\nBELT AND ROAD\n\nThe Chinese and Pakistani leaders also highlighted discussion around how to speed up progress on the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the $60 billion infrastructure programme China launched as part of its flagship \u201cBelt and Road\u201d project.\n\nSome officials and observers have said momentum on CPEC is slowing, in part due to concerns over the size of Pakistan\u2019s debt and struggling economy, which led Islamabad to turn to the International Monetary Fund for a $6 billion bailout package in July.\n\n\u201cThe two sides expressed determination to speedily execute CPEC so that its growth potential can be fully realized making it a high-quality demonstration project for BRI,\u201d the governments said in a joint statement.\n\nKhan said that his government was setting up a \u201cCPEC Authority\u201d to expedite projects, and making arrangements to help Gwadar Port, a deep sea port in Pakistan\u2019s southern Balochistan province, become a regional trade hub.\n\nKhan did not provide details on the plans, but earlier in the day Pakistan\u2019s media reported that the maritime minister had announced China Overseas Ports Holding Company, which operates the port, would get a 23-year tax exemption for installation of machinery and other equipment at the port.", "description": "Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday he was watching the situation in Kashmir and would support Pakistan in issues related to its core interests, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438758736&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980LL", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
