Hurray, I thought \u2013 someone else is going to look at the Northern Lights with their eyes, instead of a wide lense \u2013 and then he started taking off his clothes.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn the snow, he stripped down completely, strode a couple of feet away down the garden with his back to us, spread his legs, thrust his arms skyward and screamed \u201cWooohooo!\u201d as our host captured the event for posterity with his long exposure shot.\n\nHe must have caught my look of revulsion, because he apologised for offending the \u201cladies\u201d and exchanged a look \u2013 if you\u2019re female, you already know that look \u2013 with our host (who later informed me that I wasn\u2019t \u201chis kind of person\u201d).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not offended,\u201d I said at the time. Though I should have added, \u201cI just think you\u2019re repellent.\u201d\n\nBecause repellent\u2019s the word for the new \u2018trend\u2019 apparently sweeping the travelsphere. Buoyed by an Instagram account which has 86,000 followers, daring/sassy/pathetic (delete as appropriate) travellers are going to knock-out destinations, pulling down their pants and posing for a photo. Grand Canyon? Let me add another to the shot. Lol! To infinity.\n\nThe Cheeky Exploits account was first shared on a travel group I belong to, with a request for members to share their own bare-bottomed photos. Dozens did. When one person expressed disapproval, they were shouted down as a prude. And no one wants to be a prude.\n\nBut it\u2019s not prudish to think pulling down your pants and flashing your bum isn\u2019t appropriate tourist behaviour.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of my butt,\u201d they say \u2013 because of course, this appears to be a trend started in America and perpetuated by American tourists.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if my mom sees the photo.\u201d But it\u2019s not about your 'mom', is it?\n\nIt\u2019s about the people who live there. It\u2019s about perpetuating the ugly American (and Australian and Brit) stereotype. Because if there\u2019s one thing that links the bum cheeks on the Cheeky Exploits account, it\u2019s that the vast majority are toned a pasty white.\n\nI get it. You\u2019re young, you\u2019re proud of your pert bum cheeks, you think it\u2019s great bantz to flash the world \u2013 I don\u2019t care! I\u2019m fearless! I\u2019m a Cool Girl/Bro! Look at me roar!\n\nBut the photos don\u2019t say fearless to me. Derivative, maybe. Attention-seeking, definitely. Desperate, probably. Offensive: indisputably. And not because of your naked bottom \u2013 as you keep saying, every time we look appalled, we\u2019ve all got them; but because of the disrespect to the locals that you convey.\n\nFirst world travellers are great at conveying that already, of course. Whether it\u2019s French tourists shouting their way round churches in Venice, Americans breaking into the Colosseum or Jennifer Lawrence joking (because it\u2019s always just a joke, get over it grandma) about scratching her bum on a sacred rock in Hawaii, no other group of travellers acts as if they hold the sites they\u2019re travelling to see in such contempt.\n\nFor the selfie and belfie generation, it\u2019s all about them. They pick their holiday destinations according their Instagram potential. They turn their backs to the sights so they can squeeze their face into the shot. Instead of watching the Northern Lights with their eyes, when they\u2019ve crossed time zones and spent thousands to experience them, they watch them through the viewfinder, or strip off and scream to make sure they get that kerrazy profile pic that\u2019ll break their \u201clikes\u201d record.\n\nYou\u2019d think we\u2019d have learned our lessons after a group of tourists (including a 23-year-old British woman) were tried for \u201cobscene acts\u201d by stripping on a sacred mountain in Malaysia. But we didn\u2019t. Instead, the cheeky exploits crew rolled their eyes at the idea that to the locals, Mount Kinabalu was sacred and the subsequent earthquake was put down to the tourists offending the spirits.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Two of the photos on the Cheeky Exploits feed appear to have been taken near where I live. It\u2019s not a sacred site \u2013 it\u2019s just a town. But I\u2019m offended nevertheless. How dare someone come to my home and think it\u2019s appropriate to flash their arse on the main street? If it was an old man in a mac, he\u2019d be arrested. But because they\u2019re young, cellulite-free and a dab hand with Instagram filters, it\u2019s ok.\n\nBut it\u2019s not ok. It\u2019s not just desecration; it\u2019s rude. I long for the innocent days of inappropriate selfies.\n\nWe\u2019ve all got one, you say. Indeed we have. So do us all a favour and put yours away.", "description": "It was on an ill-fated trip to see the Northern Lights in February that I was first exposed to the concept of \u201ccheeky exploits\u201d.", "authors": ["Julia Buckley"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/03/16/untitled.png"}
