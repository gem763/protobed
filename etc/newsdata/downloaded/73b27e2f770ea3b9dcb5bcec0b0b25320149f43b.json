He said he spoke with Mr. Volker eight times and displayed the text messages on Laura Ingraham\u2019s show on Fox News on Thursday night, calling on Mr. Volker to confirm that the department initiated contact.\n\n\u201cHe should step forward and explain what he did,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said on the show. \u201cThe whistle-blower falsely alleges that I was operating on my own. Well, I wasn\u2019t operating on my own!\u201d\n\nReferring to Mr. Volker and Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, Mr. Giuliani added: \u201cThey basically knew everything I was doing. So, it was being done with the authorization and at the request \u2014 and then I have a final one in which they \u2014 there is a big \u2018thank you\u2019 about how my honest and straightforward discussion led to solving a problem in the relationship.\u201d\n\nThe State Department did not respond to a request for comment on Mr. Volker\u2019s resignation on Friday, nor did it leap to his defense after The New York Times first reported on his role in facilitating Mr. Giuliani\u2019s talks with the new Ukrainian government.\n\nIn a statement last month in response to that story, a department spokesperson said that Mr. Volker \u201chas confirmed that, at Presidential Advisor Andriy Yermak\u2019s request, Volker put Yermak in direct contact with Mr. Giuliani.\u201d The statement went on to stress that Mr. Giuliani \u201cis a private citizen and acts in a personal capacity as a lawyer for President Trump. He does not speak on behalf of the U.S. Government.\u201d\n\nJust days after Mr. Giuliani\u2019s breakfast with Mr. Volker and the follow-up phone call with Mr. Yermak, Mr. Trump spoke on the telephone with Mr. Zelensky. After the Ukrainian president described his need for more American assistance against Russia, Mr. Trump asked him \u201cto do us a favor, though,\u201d and look into Democrats.\n\nMr. Volker was not on that call and was neither shown a copy of the transcript reconstructed from the conversation nor told that the president mentioned Mr. Biden, according to one person informed about the series of events. Mr. Volker participated in Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with Mr. Zelensky on the sideline of the United Nations this week in his last official duty.", "description": "House leaders announced on Friday that they would interview Mr. Volker in a deposition next week in connection to their impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/28/world/28-dc-Volker-PRINT/merlin_158531811_aaab7ac0-f029-4144-bda7-a7c374a1378c-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
