Critics warned that those under 18 would be able to bypass the restriction using VPNs to disguise their locations, or switch to other social media platforms that host pornographic content, such as Reddit and Twitter, which aren\u2019t covered by the law.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2018s commitment to protecting children online is unwavering,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe want to deliver the most comprehensive approach to keeping children safe online.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FUK-Porn-Ban-hed.jpg&signature=08d5eedbe21a665e550d725000d605e7", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
