Of the 21 members, eight are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, five are locks to one day join them, and at least two more will have a compelling case for Canton. Matthew Stafford became the 21st member of that group during the Detroit Lions' game against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday. And while he's the fastest in NFL history to reach that milestone \u2014 by a comfortable margin of four games \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean he'll be Hall of Fame-bound once his playing days are done. Here's a look at Stafford's meteoric climb to the top of this elite club, and how he compares against the other members of the group:\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nIt's not far-fetched to think Stafford will retire as the NFL\u2019s all-time leading passer (Drew Brees currently ranks first with 74,845 yards \u2014 and he's still going). And while it's true Stafford has benefited from playing from behind \u2014 51.7% of his yards have come while trailing \u2014 he also benefited from having supreme arm talent and playing eight seasons with Calvin Johnson, one of the greatest receivers in NFL history.\n\nStafford's success as a passer includes some pretty epic tales, from throwing balls so hard he dislocated a receiver's finger to ripping a player's glove. His favorite passing memory, however, came against the Eagles on Thanksgiving in 2015, when he shook off a play call from Jim Bob Cooter and lasered a 25-yard touchdown pass into Calvin Johnson's outstretched arms as part of a five-touchdown day. Stafford eclipsed 400 yards passing in the game, something he has done eight times in his career.\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nIt's true quarterbacks are judged by wins and losses, and Stafford's 68-77-1 record does little to inspire praise (he's one of only three players in the 40K club with a losing record; Vinny Testaverde and Kerry Collins are the others). Still, by digging deeper \u2014 and recognizing the Lions drafted him No. 1 overall right after they finished 0-16 \u2014 Stafford emerges as one of the more clutch quarterbacks of his era. He has 28 fourth-quarter comebacks in his career, which is tied for 10th among players in the 40K club, and in 2016 he set the NFL record with eight fourth-quarter comebacks in a single season. What's it all mean? Well, Stafford has passed a lot late in games. In fact, 26.85% of his passing yards have come in the fourth quarter, second most among active players in the 40K club (Eli Manning is first at 26.97%).\n\nPlaying for four offensive coordinators in 11 years has a way of shaking a quarterback, but Stafford has seemed to evolve with the change. What hasn't changed, however, is his willingness to spread the ball around to multiple receivers in the quick passing game. 71.4% of Stafford's passing yards have come on throws traveling 15 yards or less though the air. And of the 11,000-plus yards on throws travelling more than 15 yards through the air, 3,688 went to Calvin Johnson, 1,620 went to Marvin Jones and 1,112 went to Golden Tate, now with the New York Giants. The trio accounts for about 56.2% of Stafford's deep-throw production, though the number could begin to shrink with the emergence of Kenny Golladay, who entered Sunday with 866 yards receiving on \"deep\" balls 31 games into his career.\n\nStafford's largest passing numbers have come against the Lions' NFC North rivals, which isn't exactly a surprise. He has faced the Bears and Packers 18 times each, the Vikings 19 times and had a 25-29 record against division opponents entering Sunday. Still, his success against the Pack stands out. Of his 43 career games with at least 300 yards passing, six have come against Green Bay, including the most prolific outing of his career: A 520-yard performance at Lambeau Field on Jan. 1, 2012.", "description": "Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford became the 21st member of the 40,000-yard club on Monday against the Green Bay Packers.", "authors": ["Dave Birkett", "Ryan Ford", "Chris Thomas", "Published P.M.
