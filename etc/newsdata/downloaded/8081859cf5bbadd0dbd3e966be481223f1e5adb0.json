The 34-year-old Olympic champion and world record holder said afterward: \u201cI am the happiest man today.\"\n\nAided by a pace car and a laser designed to show him the ideal place to run on the road, along with fellow runners tagging along to help him maintain his clip and cadence, Kipchoge\u2019s time won\u2019t technically qualify as a world record.\n\nKENYA'S ELIUD KIPCHOGE BECOMES FIRST PERSON TO SHATTER 2-HOUR MARATHON BARRIER\n\nThose caveats may lead critics to try and diminish the magnitude of the Kenyan\u2019s magnificent feat. But the fact remains that he\u2019s the first human to break the two-hour barrier in the world\u2019s most historic distance run.\n\nPrior to the start of his incredible run, Kipchoge reflected on the larger meaning and purpose behind the challenge.\n\n\u201cIn breaking the two-hour barrier, I want to open minds to think that no human is limited,\u201d Kipchoge said. \u201cAll our minds, all our thoughts are parallel.\u201d\n\nKipchoge\u2019s accomplishment brings to mind Sir Roger Bannister\u2019s breaking of the four-minute mile on May 6, 1954. At the time, many experts considered it impossible for any human to run that fast. In fact, some medical experts predicted the lungs would collapse under such pressure.\n\nWhat is your equivalent of the sub-two-hour marathon? Allow Kipchoge\u2019s incredible accomplishment to give you permission to dream again \u2013 and take that first step. Go for it.\n\nBut Bannister refused to believe the critics. He increased his training, refined his speed workouts and pursued the goal with unbridled enthusiasm and ambition.\n\nBelieve it or not, Bannister actually spent the morning of his race working at his hospital job. Outside the weather worsened. But when Bannister toed the line he believed the goal was within reach \u2013 because he believed nothing was impossible.\n\nIncredibly, just 46 days later an Australian named John Landy broke Bannister\u2019s record.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Bannister had shown that the seemingly impossible was possible.\n\nIt strikes me that Kipchoge\u2019s accomplishment will inevitably usher in a slew of record marathon times \u2013 because he has demonstrated that a person is capable of running faster than many thought anyone could.\n\nMost of us will never run a marathon, let alone compete for a world record time. But all of us have hopes and dreams \u2013 and many of us have been told those aspirations are impossible.\n\nDon\u2019t believe it.\n\nIn the early 1960s, President John F. Kennedy famously asked American aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun what it would take to build a rocket capable of taking man to the moon.\n\nThe scientists replied: \u201cThe will to do it.\u201d\n\nThe answer applies to a lot of the lifelong dreams that millions of us have.\n\nPerhaps your dream is to start a business, build a new home, write a novel, climb a mountain, take a trip around the world, or do something else that sounds impossible.\n\nThere are probably all kinds of reasons why you haven\u2019t been able to reach your goal. Life gets busy and responsibilities have a way of changing our direction \u2013 and for very good reasons. You have a mortgage, kids to feed, college tuition to pay.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBut I wonder if we hold back because we fear our aspirations are nothing more than pipe dreams \u2013 impossible goals.\n\nEliud Kipchoge set a goal. He made a decision. Then \u2013 despite all the doubters and naysayers \u2013 he made a commitment to train and try and break the marathon record.\n\nWhat is your equivalent of the sub-two-hour marathon?

Norman Vincent Peale, author of \u201cThe Power of Positive Thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoot for the moon,\u201d Peale wrote. \u201cEven if you miss, you\u2019ll land among the stars.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY PAUL BATURA", "description": "History is made by determined men and women who shake their heads when they hear the word \u201cimpossible.\u201d Eliud Kipchoge joined their ranks Saturday when he became the first person to run a marathon in under two hours \u2013 a stunning achievement that seems like something only a comic book superhero could do.", "authors": ["Paul Batura", "Paul J.
