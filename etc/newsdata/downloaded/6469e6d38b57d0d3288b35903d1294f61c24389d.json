REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nFollowing a whistleblower complaint last week, Democrats are looking into Trump\u2019s request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a July 25 phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden is a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cI was on the phone call,\u201d Pompeo told reporters during a visit to Italy.\n\nHe said the call was in the context of U.S. policymaking in Ukraine, including \u201ctaking down the Russia threat,\u201d rooting out corruption in government and boosting the economy.\n\nTrump made the request to Zelenskiy shortly after he had frozen nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine. Democrats accuse Trump of soliciting foreign interference in a U.S. election and of using taxpayer money as leverage for personal political gain.\n\nThe call and the whistleblower\u2019s complaint prompted House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch a formal impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24.\n\nIn an intensifying battle between Congress and the executive branch, lawmakers have subpoenaed Pompeo and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, as well as documents. They will begin depositions of current and former State Department officials this week.\n\nThe department\u2019s inspector general, Steve Linick, was due to brief congressional staff on Wednesday to address Ukraine-related documents that have been subpoenaed, according to two sources familiar with the situation.\n\nPompeo on Tuesday objected to House efforts to obtain depositions and accused Democrats of bullying and intimidation.\n\nAsked about his concerns, Pompeo said State Department employees had been contacted directly by lawmakers or their staff and told not to talk to the State Department\u2019s legal counsel.\n\nHe said, however, that he would cooperate with Congress.\n\n\u201cWe will of course do our constitutional duty to cooperate with this co-equal branch but we are going to do so in a way that is consistent with the fundamental values of the American system,\u201d he said.\n\nThe heads of three House committees leading the impeachment probe have, in turn, accused Pompeo of intimidating witnesses, and said doing so was illegal.\n\nThe Democratic chairmen of the three committees warned Pompeo on Tuesday that he would be considered \u201ca fact witness in the House impeachment inquiry\u201d if he was on Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy.\n\nTESTIMONY\n\nTrump, who is seeking a second term in the election next year, has denied wrongdoing and assailed the impeachment probe.\n\nAccording to a summary of the call released by the White House, Trump asked Zelenskiy during the July call to investigate Biden and his son Hunter in coordination with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Giuliani.\n\nHunter Biden had sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that was under investigation by Kiev.\n\nKurt Volker, who resigned on Friday as Trump\u2019s special representative for Ukraine, was to go to Capitol Hill to give a deposition to House staff on Thursday, the day he had been asked to appear.\n\nRelated Coverage Putin says he doesn't mind if his calls with Trump are disclosed\n\nMarie Yovanovitch, who was U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until she was abruptly recalled in May, has agreed to appear on Oct. 11.\n\nWith their deep knowledge of Ukraine, testimony by Yovanovitch and Volker could be especially important to the impeachment probe.\n\nThe inquiry could lead to approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. That would lead to a trial in the Senate on whether to remove him from office. But the president\u2019s fellow Republicans control that chamber and have shown little appetite for removing him.", "description": "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged on Wednesday that he was on the telephone call between Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart that sparked impeachment proceedings against the Republican president.", "authors": ["David Brunnstrom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436244847&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910ZR"}
