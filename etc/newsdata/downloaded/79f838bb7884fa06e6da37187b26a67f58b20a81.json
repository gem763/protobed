Dodo, as it is called in Yoruba, refers to fried sweet plantains. For the plantains to caramelize properly, use ripe plantains (the skin should be deep yellow and speckled with large black dots). If you can find only green plantains, you can seal them in a paper bag and let them ripen for 2 to 3 days. Cooking the plantains in hot oil brings out their caramelized sweetness, and a quick toss with pickled onions adds an acidic bite. Enjoy these sweet, tangy morsels on their own, or serve this dish alongside jollof, plain steamed rice, frejon or plain cooked beans.\n\nFeatured in: Yewande Komolafe\u2019s 10 Essential Nigerian Recipes.", "description": "Fried, grilled, boiled, dehydrated and pulverized, sweet or savory, plantains are a staple of Nigerian cuisine Dodo, as it is called in Yoruba, refers to fried sweet plantains For the plantains to caramelize properly, use ripe plantains (the skin should be deep yellow and speckled with large black dots)", "authors": ["Yewande Komolafe", "Julia Moskin", "Francis Lam", "Roxanne Fequiere", "Moira Hodgson", "Pierre Franey", "Daisann Mclane", "Samin Nosrat", "Sarah Digregorio", "Jennifer Steinhauer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/26/dining/24Nigerianrex6/24Nigerianrex6-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-26"}
