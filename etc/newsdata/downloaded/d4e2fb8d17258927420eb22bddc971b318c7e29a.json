Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) is another one of those critics. He holds leadership positions in the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. On CNN\u2019s \u201cCuomo Prime Time\u201d on Monday night, he offered a long explanation of why Republicans disagree with Trump that is worth examining. In essence, he thinks Trump is choosing his reelection over what\u2019s right for the country. Let\u2019s break down what he said.\n\nKinzinger: Well, first off, the president has to lead. That\u2019s where a lot of times, when people look at public opinion polls, it\u2019s America\u2019s knee-jerk reaction to want to get out of any war, I understand that. Because they have to have leaders that explain why we\u2019re doing it.\n\nKinzinger is indirectly accusing Trump of doing the politically expedient thing. Conflict is generally unpopular with the American public, and we\u2019re nearing an election with ominous warning signs for Trump. In addition, Trump has made moves before to get out of Syria \u2014 in December, his defense secretary resigned over it. So what Trump is doing makes sense politically, Kinzinger is saying, but sometimes you have to prioritize foreign policy over politics, especially now that Trump has much more information at his disposal as commander in chief. He should at least try to leverage the power of the presidency to explain to Americans why he is not fulfilling a campaign promise to get out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis echoes McConnell\u2019s statement that Trump should \u201cexercise American leadership.\u201d Here is more from Kinzinger:\n\nWe\u2019re actually generally a pretty peaceful country. So when the president says I\u2019m getting out because of all these reasons, he talks about endless war, he talks about that kind of stuff. The reality is, is terrorism\u2019s real. And the decision to end the war is not really ours to make when you have a whole group of folks that say, you know, look, we\u2019re going to go and create a terrorist attack, whether it\u2019s in Iraq or the United States. That\u2019s not our choice. They haven\u2019t changed their mind on it.\n\nKinzinger brings up two main points. Yes, the United States has been involved in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan for nearly two decades. But outside of that, America is not engaging in a ton of other conflicts. Syria is the exception.\n\nHis second point is Trump\u2019s campaign promise was unrealistic when it comes to keeping Americans safe. You can\u2019t be entirely at peace when terrorism is a threat, he is saying. In an interview with Fox News\u2019s Martha MacCallum, also on Monday, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s not the choice that the United States determines, how long we\u2019re going to fight terrorism. It\u2019s a decision the terrorists make, because they determine if they\u2019re going to kill innocent people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHere, Kinzinger is referring to the main reason the United States sent troops to Syria in the first place: to battle the Islamic State. The group has been dispersed, but they are not entirely vanquished, as Trump likes to say they are. Outside of a key border zone between Syria and Turkey, \u201cthe risk of an Islamic State comeback is most grave,\u201d reports The Washington Post from Lebanon.\n\nAD\n\nThis echoes what Graham said on Twitter, as well.\n\nI feel very bad for the Americans and allies who have sacrificed to destroy the ISIS Caliphate because this decision virtually reassures the reemergence of ISIS. So sad. So dangerous.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump may be tired of fighting radical Islam. They are NOT tired of fighting us. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\nKinzinger: And so, yes, it may have been a campaign promise, but when you become president, I think it has to be more than a campaign promise. And secondarily, too, what we\u2019re talking about is the exact kind of fight that those that we\u2019re against, for instance, the Iraq war and everything else we\u2019re talking about. You know, a small group of American soldiers that can empower local indigenous forces to fight that fight. That\u2019s exactly what our troops are doing there. And now to say this is an endless war, I have to vehemently disagree.\n\nAnother fear among those who oppose the Syrian pullout is that the United States will be putting Syrian Kurds, an ethic minority who helped American troops battle the Islamic State, at risk to players in the region like Turkey. That will destabilize the region in a way that benefits the Islamic State. These all play off each other.\n\nAD\n\nTo make his point, Kinzinger draws comparison between a destabilized Syria and destabilized Iraq and the subsequent eight-year Iraq War. Trump\u2019s not in an endless war, he argues. But by leaving a smaller conflict, he risks creating an endless war, Kinzinger warns.\n\nThe key line is this: \u201cWhen you become president, I think it has to be more than a campaign promise.\u201d That brings us around to Kinzinger\u2019s first point, that he thinks Trump is putting political expediency over choosing a more difficult route. The logical conclusion to what he\u2019s saying is some Republicans, like Kinzinger, believe Trump, three years in, does not get what it means to be president or how to do it.\n\nAD", "description": "Rep.
