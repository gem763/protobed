These pages targeted users in the U.S., North Africa and Latin America. The pages posted content focused on a variety of topics, including issues such as tensions between Israel and Palestine, U.S. race relations and Black Lives Matter.\n\nThe company said it removed 50 Instagram accounts and one Facebook account that originated in Russia. These accounts published content aimed at U.S. users.\n\n\"The people behind this operation often posted on both sides of political issues including topics like US elections, environmental issues, racial tensions, LGBTQ issues, political candidates, confederate ideas, conservatism and liberalism,\" Facebook said in a blog post. \"They also maintained accounts presenting themselves as local in some swing states, and posed as either conservatives or progressives.\"\n\nIn an interview with NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that China has also been found to have attempted to interfere in a number of elections.\n\n\"We do see today Russia and Iran and China increasingly with more sophisticated tactics are trying to interfere in elections,\" Zuckerberg said in the interview. \"But part of why I'm confident going into 2020 is that we've played a role in defending against interference in every major election around the world since 2016, in France, in Germany, in the E.U. overall, in India, in Mexico, in Brazil.\"\n\nIn addition to the network removals, Facebook on Monday announced a number of changes it is making to prepare for the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\nFacebook is going to more prominently label posts that include false information. These labels will include a gray blurred screen that says \"false information\" that will hide false and partly false photos and videos.", "description": "Facebook on Monday announced that it removed four networks of \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" tied to Russia and Iran from its services.", "authors": ["Salvador Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106140614-1568978901022rtx73o80.jpg?v=1571679653", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
