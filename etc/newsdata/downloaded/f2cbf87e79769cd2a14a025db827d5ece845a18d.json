Pope Benedict beatified him in 2010 when visiting the UK.\n\nNoting that Newman is the first Briton to be declared a saint in over 40 years, Prince Charles held him up as \u201ca great Briton\u201d and \u201cone of the greatest theologians of the nineteenth century.\u201d\n\nNewman\u2019s engagement \u201cfirst with Anglican theology, and then, after his conversion, Catholic theology, impressed even his opponents with its fearless honesty, its unsparing rigour and its originality of thought,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn his font-page tribute to Newman, Prince Charles said that his faith \u201cwas truly catholic in that it embraced all aspects of life. It is in that same spirit that we, whether we are Catholics or not, can, in the tradition of the Christian Church throughout the ages, embrace the unique perspective, the particular wisdom and insight, brought to our universal experience by this one individual soul.\u201d\n\nThe two-page op-ed also underscores Newman\u2019s lasting influence on theology as well as the lives of ordinary Christians.\n\n\u201cAs a theologian, his work on the development of doctrine showed that our understanding of God can grow over time, and had a profound impact on later thinkers,\u201d Charles wrote. \u201cIndividual Christians have found their personal devotion challenged and strengthened by the importance he attached to the voice of conscience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose of all traditions who seek to define and defend Christianity have found themselves grateful for the way he reconciled faith and reason,\u201d the prince continued. \u201cThose who seek the divine in what can seem like an increasingly hostile intellectual environment find in him a powerful ally who championed the individual conscience against an overwhelming relativism.\u201d\n\nNewman is a particularly important witness for our days, when believers are persecuted for their faith as at no other time.\n\n\u201cAnd perhaps most relevantly of all at this time, when we have witnessed too many grievous assaults by the forces of intolerance on communities and individuals, including many Catholics, because of their beliefs, he is a figure who stood for his convictions despite the disadvantages of belonging to a religion whose adherents were denied full participation in public life,\u201d Prince Charles wrote.\n\n\u201cAs we mark the life of this great Briton, this great churchman and, as we can now say, this great saint, who bridges the divisions between traditions, it is surely right that we give thanks for the friendship which, despite the parting, has not merely endured, but has strengthened,\u201d Charles declared.\n\n\u201cIn the image of divine harmony which Newman expressed so eloquently, we can see how, ultimately, as we follow with sincerity and courage the different paths to which conscience calls us, all our divisions can lead to a greater understanding and all our ways can find a common home,\u201d he concluded.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The Prince of Wales has written a tribute to the \"great Briton\" John Henry Newman for the Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
