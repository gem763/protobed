Andrew Cuomo (D) used a racial slur in a radio interview Tuesday while discussing racism against Italian Americans.\n\n\u201cThey used an expression that southern Italians were called \u2014 quote unquote, pardon my language, but I am just quoting the Times \u2014 \u2018nigger wops,\u2019 N-word wops, as a derogatory comment,\u201d he said in a conversation with Alan Chartock on WAMC in Albany, referring to a New York Times article about racism against Italian Americans in the 19th century.\n\nCuomo\u2019s comments were part of a tangent during an unrelated question. Earlier in the interview, he discussed racism and stereotypes against Italian Americans, after being asked about Columbus Day, which many Italian Americans see as a day of pride. There have been growing calls to change the holiday to Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day to honor Native Americans who were killed and whose lands were pillaged by European colonizers in the Americas.\n\nWhile acknowledging that Native Americans \u201chave been abused\u201d and affirming his support for commemorating Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, he said the holiday and monuments for the explorer contain \u201ca broader symbolism\u201d for Italian Americans.\n\nFor example, he said the Christopher Columbus statue in New York City\u2019s Columbus Circle, which many activists have called to remove, \u201cwas put up at a time when the Italian Americans were being abused.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he believes there is still prejudice against Italian Americans, Cuomo emphatically said \u201cyes\u201d multiple times.\n\nThe governor then referred to several examples \u2014 including his brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who recently got into an altercation with a man who mocked him as Fredo, John Cazale\u2019s hapless character from \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the \u2018N-word\u2019 for us,\u201d the younger Cuomo told the man.\n\nA spokesperson for the governor declined to comment on or further clarify his direct use of a racial slur, referring back to the Times article.", "description": "The New York governor said the phrase \"n****r w*ps\" on the air, citing a New York Times article.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da5f7512100004c0fad001b.jpeg?cache=myi1hnxg3f&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
