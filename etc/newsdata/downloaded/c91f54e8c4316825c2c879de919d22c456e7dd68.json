Hunter Biden served on the Ukrainian company\u2019s board at the time.\n\nBiden bragged on video about bullying Ukraine into firing the prosecutor.\n\nTitled \u201cBiden Corruption,\u201d the 30-second video clip is running on various cable networks and online.\n\nOn Wednesday, CNN obtained a letter from the Biden presidential campaign asking Twitter to reject what appears to be the same Trump re-election campaign ad.\n\nThe letter \u201cacknowledges that the social media company has said the ad complies with its policies,\u201d the news network noted. Nevertheless, the Biden campaign reportedly requested that Twitter \u201cpromptly reassess\u201d that position.\n\nCNN reported:\n\nSpecifically, the letter calls on Twitter to make a distinction between the personal account of a politician and paid advertising content \u2026 Twitter has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. The move from Biden\u2019s team appears to be part of a broad campaign to respond to Trump\u2019s attacks on social media.\n\nLast Monday, CNN refused to run the \u201cBiden Corruption\u201d ad, alleging the video \u201cdoes not meet our advertising standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN,\u201d the network added in a statement.\n\nTim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 campaign\u2019s communications director, lambasted CNN\u2019s decision, accusing the network of \u201cspend[ing] all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, claiming he attempted to coerce his Ukrainian counterpart into investigating the corruption allegations against Biden and his son.\n\nTrump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have denied the claim. The White House is refusing to cooperate with the impeachment investigation, saying it is a \u201cpartisan and unconstitutional\u201d probe.", "description": "Joe Biden's campaign tried to get the media to kill stories about the Ukraine corruption scandal linked to the former vice president.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Joe-Biden-Screaming-Pointing-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
