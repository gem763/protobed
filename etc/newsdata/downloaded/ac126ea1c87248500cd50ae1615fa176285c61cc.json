(Chinatopix via AP)\n\nTHE KEY\n\nHuawei knows its court fight against U.S. government charges that it's complicit in Chinese spying will be a long slog. So the Chinese telecom is waging a public relations battle instead.\n\nHuawei, which has been targeted by a slew of U.S. government restrictions, is now making its case directly to American companies. A company official tells me Huawei is reaching out to firms to defend its reputation and outline how it protects against Chinese espionage.\n\nThey're also becoming a visible player in forums for industry pros: Huawei officials increased their presence at an annual convention of U.S. wireless carriers last week to push back against the government\u2019s claims, the official noted, and even sponsored a panel discussion titled \u201cLet\u2019s Collaborate to Make America\u2019s Communication Networks Safer.\u201d\n\nThe lobbying efforts are an about-face for Huawei, which has historically shied away from big confrontations with the U.S. government though it's been accused of assisting Chinese government hacking for more than half a dozen years. The official says the company is now taking drastic action as the Trump administration's moves over the last 18 months make it far more difficult for Huawei to do business \u2014 not just in the United States but anywhere in the world.\n\nThe purpose of the pitch to companies isn\u2019t just to win their business. The broader P.R. campaign could also help improve their reputation in other countries where the company is not facing government bans.\n\n\u201cWith these actions taking place, Huawei not only believes that it has to defend its own legal rights in the United States but also needs to maximize its education \u2026 about who the company is, about what it's required to do under Chinese law and what it\u2019s required to do under U.S. law,\u201d the Huawei official told me, under condition of anonymity to speak freely about company strategy.\n\nThose U.S. restrictions include a ban on government agencies and their contractors buying components from Huawei and on certain American companies selling Huawei software and other materials. The Trump administration also banned Huawei from playing any role in building the United States' next-generation 5G wireless networks and has lobbied other nations to impose similar restrictions. although only a handful have followed suit.\n\nThe pushback may be too little too late for Huawei\u2019s U.S. business. The telecom has had to lay off half of its U.S. employees in recent months, the company\u2019s lawyers said last week during a hearing challenging the U.S. government ban, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Tawnell D. Hobbs reported.\n\nBut any progress pushing back on U.S. restrictions probably will help Huawei\u2019s reputation in Europe, Latin America and other regions where governments and industry have been hesitant to buy the U.S. argument that there\u2019s no safe way to use Huawei gear without giving a green light to Chinese spying.\n\nAnd there are some signs Huawei's efforts are paying off in the U.S. The company has had informal talks in recent months with officials at some U.S. government agencies examining whether there\u2019s any way to repair that relationship, the official said, but declined to say what agencies the company had spoken to.\n\n\u201cThere have been some communications, but some phone calls are still not being returned,\u201d the official said. \u201cSome folks are hearing our message and are willing to talk, but it\u2019s still a challenge.\u201d\n\nHuawei also got some good news in federal court last week when Judge Amos L. Mazzant III seemed hesitant to dismiss the company\u2019s case challenging the U.S. government ban. Mazzant wondered aloud during the hearing whether there was some way to protect government computer networks from Chinese espionage without imposing such a sweeping and damaging restriction on Huawei, the Journal reported.\n\nThe judge also asked for additional filings from Huawei and the government, and said he doesn\u2019t have \u201can inkling\u201d of how he intends to rule in the matter, Bloomberg News\u2019s Edvard Pettersson reported.\n\nIf Huawei successfully knocks back the government\u2019s effort to dismiss the case, that would be a significant victory for the company \u2014 especially because a lawsuit filed by the Russian anti-virus company Kaspersky over a similar ban and that made the same legal arguments got thrown out last year at that early stage.\n\nBoth companies argue that Congress overstepped its bounds and unfairly singled them out for punishment by imposing the bans.\n\nYou are reading The Cybersecurity 202, our must-read newsletter on cybersecurity policy news.

(Michel Euler/AP)\n\nPINGED: Microsoft will continue to offer state and local election officials free cybersecurity support for voting systems that use the Windows 7 operating system through the 2020 election, even as it ceases to provide those updates to other users, Sean Lyngaas at CyberScoop reported. Microsoft's decision follows an announcement by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission that it would not recommend that states decertify machines running on the decade-old software despite serious security concerns.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that Windows 7 end-of-life doesn\u2019t \u2026 become a barrier to having a secure and safe election,\u201d Jan Neutze, head of Microsoft\u2019s cybersecurity and democracy team, said.\n\nMicrosoft will cease updates for Windows 7 in January, which would have left elections across the country more vulnerableto hacking. The free updates will also be available to other countries holding national elections in 2020, Sean reports.\n\nThe headquarters of the Russian General Staff's Main Intelligence Department (GRU) in Moscow.

That means that even if U.S. digital defenders figure out how to defend against one Russian group they'll still be vulnerable to other ones, the researchers said. This would make it extremely easy for Russians to launch a \u201clarge-scale election hack\u201d in 2020, the researchers warn.\n\nEmployees watch electronic boards monitoring possible ransomware cyberattacks at the Korea Internet and Security Agency. (Yun Dong-jin/Yonhap/AP)\n\nPWNED: Two years after the WannaCry ransomware attack took down hundreds of thousands of computers around the world, versions of the malicious software are still plaguing some users, Danny Palmer at ZDNet reports. The number of WannaCry attacks are at an all-time high since 2017 and in August the cybersecurity firm Sophos intercepted more than 4 million WannaCry-related attacks, Danny reports.\n\nSecurity researchers managed to halt the original WannaCry attack, which U.S. officials say was launched by North Korea, by creating a \u201ckill switch\u201d that stopped the code in its tracks. But Sophos has since identified nearly 3,000 variations of the malware that are immune to the kill switch.\n\nA big part of the problem is that users aren't updating their computers to protect against new hacking tools and are missing out on crucial patches that could protect them from not just WannaCry, but a host of other malware, Peter Mackenzie, security specialist at Sophos, told Danny.\n\nPUBLIC KEY\n\n\u2014 Cybersecurity news from the public sector:\n\nThe Urgent Search for a Cyber Silver Bullet Against Iran As the United States weighs possible cyberattacks against Iran, it is looking for options that would deter Tehran from further strikes but avoid creating more conflict in the region.
