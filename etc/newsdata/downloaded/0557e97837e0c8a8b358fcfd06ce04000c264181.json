Giuliani, a lawyer to President Trump, wipes his brow before the start of the White House Sports and Fitness Day on the South Lawn of the White House on May 30. (Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE)\n\nEmily Tamkin is a freelance writer and reporter based in Washington, DC. She is the author of the forthcoming book, \"The Influence of Soros.\"\n\nRudolph W. Giuliani, whom President Trump reportedly used to pressure Ukraine to investigate political rivals, has evidently decided that two things will save him from scandal. The first is to continue to go on cable news shows. The second is to blame George Soros.\n\nLast week, when Laura Ingraham of Fox News Channel asked Giuliani why he, and not the FBI and the Justice Department, had been sent to investigate alleged corruption, the former New York mayor said that it was because he is Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. This, of course, prompted another question. How does investigating former vice president Joe Biden involve defending Trump? In response, Giuliani claimed that Biden had called for the firing of a prosecutor who was involved in the investigation of \u201can organization that was collecting false information about Donald Trump, about Paul Manafort, and feeding it to the Democratic National Committee.\u201d If that sounds improbably complex, all you really need to know is the name he shouted out next: \u201cThat organization,\u201d he said, \u201cwas run by George Soros.\u201d\n\nGiuliani repeated the claim on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. \u201cNovember of 2016, [the Ukrainians] first came to me, and they said, \u2018We have shocking evidence that the collusion that they claim happened in Russia, which didn\u2019t happen, happened in Ukraine, and it happened with Hillary Clinton. George Soros was behind it. George Soros\u2019s company was funding it.' \u201d Asked whether he accepts that this is untrue, Giuliani replied that it is true and that he can prove it, although he did not do so at the time.\n\nAlthough Giuliani\u2019s claims about Soros are untrue, they are also unsurprising. Soros, a Hungarian-born Jew and American billionaire, is a major political donor and favorite boogeyman on the far right in the United States. But in Central and Eastern Europe, where his philanthropic giving is a source of funding for many who fight corruption, politicians who find themselves embroiled in such scandals tend to claim that Soros is the real villain. It\u2019s a neat trick, one used throughout the region \u2014 and now by one very prominent U.S. lawyer.\n\n[Conspiracy theories about Soros aren\u2019t just false. They\u2019re anti-Semitic.]\n\nSoros, through his Open Society Foundations, has indeed been philanthropically engaged in Ukraine for decades. In his 1995 book, \u201cSoros on Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve,\u201d Soros explained that Ukraine was particularly important to him because he thought the country\u2019s independence was geopolitically important. \u201cAs long as Ukraine prospers, there can be no imperialist Russia,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAt the time, Soros\u2019s foundation in Ukraine was supporting a whole network: an institute to train public servants, a foundation to develop legal culture in the country and a center for modern art, among other institutions. He claimed that all of this was important because he wanted \u201cto supply Ukraine with the infrastructure necessary for a modern state \u2014 and an open society.\u201d\n\nSoros said that he was initially skeptical about working in Ukraine, having heard harrowing stories about what happened to the Hungarian Jews who were deported to the country during World War II. But the writer Ivan Dziuba, who asked him to set up a foundation in Ukraine and who would later work at the country\u2019s Ministry of Culture, told him that that was the point \u2014 \u201cto build a different kind of Ukraine where those kinds of atrocities couldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nSince the mid-1990s, Open Society has funded other work in Ukraine: It sought to address health epidemics \u2014 such as hepatitis and HIV \u2014 in the country; paid for election exit polls (which in turn led Soros to be blamed by some in the region and even Western writers for the 2004-2005 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, in which a Kremlin-supported candidate was ousted after the opposition protested electoral fraud); and held training on intellectual property. Perhaps most important, at least for our current political moment, it funded anti-corruption organizations. It is this last point that seems to have caught Giuliani\u2019s attention. During his conversation with Ingraham, he alluded to AntAC, a Ukrainian anti-corruption organization that receives money from, among other places, Open Society. It was investigated by Ukrainian authorities in what appears to be payback for its anti-corruption work in 2016.\n\n[Five myths about Ukraine]\n\nLearning of the AntAC-Soros link \u2014 the small kernel of reality buried deep within Giuliani\u2019s conspiracy theory \u2014 I was reminded of a reporting trip I took to Romania and Slovakia in 2017. Protesters had taken to the streets in both countries that year demanding that leaders be accountable for their reported corruption. People who wanted to undermine the protesters blamed Soros, claiming he was the real power behind them.\n\nI asked some of the protesters and anti-corruption groups working at the time if they received Open Society funding. And many, if not most, of them had. But that is different from Soros himself orchestrating efforts against political enemies, which is what their opponents were suggesting. The point of Soros\u2019s philanthropic work has always been to create societies in which people have an equitable chance at civic participation. To do that, his foundations have tried to support free and independent media, rule of law, fairly monitored elections and, yes, anti-corruption organizations. Accordingly, many NGOs and institutes and centers in Central and Eastern Europe have, at one point or another, received funding from Open Society. His goal was to help people speak up for themselves. But his very ubiquity has made it easier for his critics to see those who do speak up as Soros\u2019s puppets, his hands pulling civil society\u2019s strings.\n\nThis is why Giuliani\u2019s claims, though false, are wholly unsurprising. Soros, through Open Society, funds efforts to make governments more accountable, more transparent and less corrupt. There is, it\u2019s true, a lot of Open Society money throughout Central and Eastern Europe. One could make the argument that an international organization should not be involved in the internal affairs of various countries. But that is not what Soros\u2019s detractors claim. Instead, they say that it is Soros himself who is trying to undermine them. That he is the one who is corrupt, who is looking to take power that isn\u2019t his, who tries to bend the rules to his will.\n\n[The U.S. tried to fix Ukraine's government. We exported our corruption instead.]\n\nThat\u2019s what Romanian political leader Liviu Dragnea did when protesters balked at his attempts to get away with corruption. It\u2019s what former Slovak prime minister Robert Fico did when protesters called for his resignation after investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancee were murdered. It\u2019s what billionaire and Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis did when protesters \u2014 worried that their prime minister was going to try to undermine the independent judiciary \u2014 called for his resignation. It\u2019s what aspiring autocrats do.\n\nThat Soros would run an organization in Ukraine to collect information on Trump makes little sense, not least of all because his work there long predates the president\u2019s political campaign. But it makes all the sense in the world that Giuliani, caught in a scandal, would claim otherwise. It makes sense because Soros is the world\u2019s boogeyman, one whose name is synonymous with nefarious misdeeds to many a Trump supporter. But it also makes sense because politicians tend to blame George Soros and his anti-corruption efforts when they\u2019re called out for their missteps.\n\nAnd what is Giuliani if not a politician who has stepped in it?", "description": "He's following a template that European autocrats have been using for years.", "authors": ["Emily Tamkin", "Reporter Covering Foreign Affairs", "Emily Tamkin Is A Freelance Writer", "Reporter Based In Washington", "Dc.
