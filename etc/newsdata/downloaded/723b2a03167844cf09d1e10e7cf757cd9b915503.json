Alex Ellinghausen\n\nMr Porter came under fire in February when he appointed six former parliamentarians and eight former staffers from Coalition ranks to the AAT, as critics claim the tribunal has been gutted and stacked with Liberal insiders.\n\nSenator Carr claimed there had been a 70 per cent turnover of the AAT's 330 members by the current Coalition government, which Mr Anderson took on notice.\n\nThe senate hearing was told the AAT is struggling to meet unprecedented demand as it is inundated with a record number of cases for review, predominantly from failed refugees and migrants.\n\nAAT registrar Sian Leathem said there had been a record 60,595 lodgements in the last financial year. The tribunal finalised 44,413 applications.\n\nThe political mud-slinging follows an inquiry by former High Court judge Ian Callinan in July which called for former politicians and staffers with no legal background to be barred from post-politics jobs on the AAT. Members of the AAT can earn between $190,000 and $487,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 34 appointments made by Mr Porter in February included former Liberal Tasmanian Senate president Stephen Parry, former Nationals MP and Howard government minister De-Anne Kelly and former Liberal MP Bob Baldwin.\n\nThere were state politicians, including former Liberal speaker of the West Australian parliament Michael Sutherland, former WA Liberal MP Joe Francis and former South Australian Liberal MP Steven Griffiths.\n\nFormer Liberal staffer Tony Barry is among the many AAT appointments connected to the the Coalition. AFR\n\nCoalition staffers to receive appointments included former adviser to Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Barry, former Alexander Downer adviser Phoebe Dunn, former Jeff Kennett chief of staff John Griffin and Mr Porter's own former senior advisor William Frost.\n\nThe government moved to re-shape the AAT after Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton warned last year the tribunal was failing to \u201cuphold community standards\u201d and didn\u2019t \u201creflect the views of the Australian people\u201d.\n\n\"We have a problem with the AAT,\" he told 2GB's Ray Hadley in May 2018, \"and there\u2019s no sense pretending otherwise.\"\n\nSenator Carr pointed to Mr Barry, who had been a media advisor in Mr Turnbull's office and to former Victorian Liberal leader Matthew Guy.\n\n\"What were his special skills?\" Senator Carr asked after claiming he had been forced out of Mr Turnbull's office because of his \"aggressive attitude towards journalists\" before admitting the attack was unfair.\n\nSenator Carr also pointed to former long-serving AAT member Terry Carney, who found the Department of Human Services' automated debt recovery program was unlawful, shortly before losing his role as an example of the political nature of the appointments.", "description": "Christian Porter has warned Labor Senator Kim Carr to provide evidence  former Liberal politicians and staffers of the AAT are not up to scratch.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4572%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5beadc25e95d9d86d056cc7032c75f2737c9528d", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
