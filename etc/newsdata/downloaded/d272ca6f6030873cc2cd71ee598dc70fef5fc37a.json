Esper said Monday that Pentagon officials are weighing a plan to keep a \u201cresidual force\u201d of U.S. troops around oil fields in Syria.\n\nThose residual forces would be there to \u201cdeny access, specifically revenue to ISIS and any other groups that might want to seek that revenue to enable their own malign activities,\u201d Esper explained. Esper confirmed over the weekend that President Trump had ordered troops withdrawing from Syrian Kurdistan, or Rojava, to move to Iraq. Congress has yet to vote on and pass an authorization, which would allow President Trump order troops be sent in to protect the Syrian Kurdish people.
