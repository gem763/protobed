And then the kid responds and said, 'It\u2019s a gun.' And then I said, 'Can I see it?' And he pulled it out\u201d Blake told WFLA.\n\nThe other student -- who was also only 8 years old -- took the gun out of the backpack and showed it off. Blake waited for the other students to leave before he informed the security guard, according to the outlet.\n\n\u201cI told the security officer that kid had a gun and then I told him which backpack and the kid,\u201d he said.\n\nCaptain Chris Beaman of the Pasco Sheriff's Office told the outlet that when the backpack was searched by security, they found the 9 mm Sig Sauer handgun, adding that the weapon was loaded.\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me as a law enforcement officer who started this profession to protect, to even think of a possibility of what could have happened,\u201d said Captain Beaman after the incident.\n\nREPUBLICAN-DOMINATED FLORIDA SENATE BACKS SHERIFF'S SUSPENSION OVER PARKLAND SHOOTING\n\nThe student who brought the handgun to school faces possible criminal charges, will likely be suspended for 10 days and may face expulsion, according to WFLA.\n\nWhen Pasco police visited the apartment where Blake lives, they expressed appreciation for his brave actions.\n\n\u201cThey called me a hero,\u201d Blake told WFLA.\n\nJohnson's mother, Laynie, says she found out about the incident after the school principal sent a message to parents explaining what happened, adding she didn't know her 8-year-old boy was the one who decided to get help.\n\n\"Sure enough, he comes home and tells the whole nine yards,\" she said. \"He was the one who actually saw the gun, and took the initiative to go get the help. I'm happy that he knows what to do and I'm happy that he was brave enough to do it. I'm very proud.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen asked about the incident, the third grader told the outlet, \"I know it's the right thing to do.\"", "description": "A Florida third grader is being called a hero for bravely reporting a classmate who brought a loaded gun to school on Thursday.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Hudson-Elementary-School-Google-maps.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
