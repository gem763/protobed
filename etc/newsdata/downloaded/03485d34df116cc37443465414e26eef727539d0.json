They wanted to glorify choice and make it seem like they had left of their own volition when, in fact, they had very few realistic options,\u201d Pamela Stone, the author of \u201cOpting Out? Why Women Really Quit Careers and Head Home\u201d and co-author of the just-published \u201cOpting Back In,\u201d told me.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis brings me to the matter of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and her elementary school teaching career back in the early 1970s. By now you almost certainly know the tale: Warren says on the campaign stump she was pushed out of her job in 1971 after her school\u2019s principal became aware she was pregnant. But, it turns out that, in 2007, she said she decided to return to graduate school because she lacked the needed professional credentials to teach. And, on Monday, the Washington Free Beacon turned up paperwork showing the school board in April of 1971 offered Warren a contract for the following year.\n\n\u201cGotcha!\u201d the right wing screamed. Not so fast.\n\nWarren and others have pushed back hard. She told CBS Monday night she\u2019s \u201copened up\u201d about the episode in recent years. She said the school district officials didn\u2019t know she was pregnant when they initially re-upped her contract. When officials found out, she says, the principal of her school pushed her out. And, indeed, CBS found two teachers from the school district who said that while they did not know Warren, the school district involved routinely behaved as Warren described \u2014 and that teachers like Warren, lacking tenure or union protections, would have had little to no defense against the action.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s likely that\u2019s where the story will remain. The definitive proof will remain beyond our grasp. It\u2019s not just that memory is imperfect, the proof we are looking for almost certainly doesn\u2019t exist. What we now understand as wrongs were not seen as such at the time. Things that horrify in 2019 didn\u2019t arouse much in the way of comment decades ago. It was just how things were. It\u2019s not a contradiction to discover local newspapers at the time described Warren\u2019s departure as a resignation \u201cfor personal reasons\u201d and that she was \u201cleaving to raise a family.\u201d That\u2019s almost certainly what many people at the time believed to be true. They didn\u2019t see these as euphemisms hiding something much more disturbing.\n\nThe Warren teaching contretemps parallels, in some ways, the confrontation between Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and former vice president Joe Biden at the July Democratic presidential debate. Gillibrand accused Biden of insulting working women in a 1981 op-ed where he proclaimed families with two working parents were often selfish, prioritizing shopping sprees and vacations over the welfare of their children and elderly parents. Au contraire, the fact-checkers claimed. Biden never specifically referred to women in the piece. True \u2014 but in 1981, he didn\u2019t have to do that. That was \u201cwomen\u2019s work,\u201d and that\u2019s how it would have been read by almost everyone.\n\nIn fact, the Republicans might want to pause the next time they push out a narrative that they believe harms Warren. Over and over again, they\u2019ve done the opposite. In an attempt to stop her rise, they instead remind everyone of her importance. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tried to shut Warren down on the floor of the Senate by claiming \u201cnevertheless she persisted\u201d despite being told to cease speaking, he simply reminded many women of the many times men refused to listen to them. Last week\u2019s laughable attempt by a right-wing activist to claim Warren had an affair with a 25-year-old former Marine engendered much ridicule, in no small part because women are often viewed by society as unattractive as they age \u2014 when they aren\u2019t invisible, that is.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPregnancy and maternal discrimination have hardly gone away either, despite the fact it\u2019s been illegal since the late 1970s. The New York Times published a heartbreaking investigative series, writing, \u201cMany of the country\u2019s largest and most prestigious companies still systematically sideline pregnant women. They pass them over for promotions and raises. They fire them when they complain.\u201d Warren\u2019s story from decades ago resonates today for a reason: It\u2019s not just a relic of the past, it\u2019s something that happens every day.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019ve all been reminded of that fact. The past is not as far away as we think.\n\nWatch the the latest from the op-ed video team:\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Warren\u2019s story from decades ago resonates today for a reason.", "authors": ["Helaine Olen", "Opinion Writer Focusing On Politics", "Economics", "American Life", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cFdr-NsE-FNbARAQ6AZp1-lC-m4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4M24DNHHEUI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
