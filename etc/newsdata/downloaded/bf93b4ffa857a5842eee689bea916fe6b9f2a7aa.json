Brown had been scheduled to earn up to \u00a340m from Oakland over the three-year deal. Instead, the Patriots guaranteed him \u00a37.3m this season, with the potential to earn as much as \u00a312.2m.\n\nBrown posted a picture of himself in a Patriots uniform on Instagram shortly after ESPN first reported the signing. The post was soon liked by New England receiver Julian Edelman, who already was splitting quarterback Tom Brady\u2019s attention with one troublemaking receiver, Josh Gordon.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Brown is unlikely to play, but even his presence on the Patriots\u2019 sideline adds a new wrinkle to his tumultuous tenure in Pittsburgh.\n\nA four-time All-Pro who caught 837 passes over nine seasons with the Steelers, the team tired of Brown\u2019s antics and traded him to Oakland in March. But he never made it onto the field in a Raiders uniform.\n\nInstead of providing them with a marquee star in their final season in Oakland before moving to Las Vegas, Brown gave them months of headaches, from a bizarre foot injury to a fight over his helmet to the blowups this week that ended his career there before it began.\n\nThe Raiders granted the disgruntled but talented receiver his Saturday morning, two days before their season opener.\n\n\u201cWe just exhausted everything,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe tried every way possible to make it work. All I\u2019m going to say is, it\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\n\nBrown asked for the release after he was upset about his latest team fine over an outburst during practice at general manager Mike Mayock. That fine allowed the Raiders to void more than \u00a323.6m in guarantees over the next two years in Brown\u2019s contract if he wasn\u2019t on the team.\n\nThe Raiders traded two mid-round draft picks to Pittsburgh for the game\u2019s most prolific receiver and gave him a three-year contract worth \u00a340.8m that now is void; Brown could still file a grievance to recover the guaranteed money.\n\nThe moves on Saturday follow a week in which Brown posted a letter on social media detailing \u00a344,000 in fines for missing team activities. (ESPN reported that he would be fined \u00a3175,000 for conduct detrimental to the team.)\n\nBrown was banished for one day, then returned to the team and apologised in a meeting and in a brief public statement. Gruden said the plan was for Brown to play in the opener Monday night against Denver, but that changed after Brown requested and was granted his release.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been crazy,\u201d Oakland receiver Tyrell Williams said. \u201cWe feel how everybody else feels. It\u2019s been wild, it\u2019s been crazy, it\u2019s been unexpected. But we\u2019re going to go out there and play regardless. He made that decision. We\u2019re going to go out there and play how we\u2019re going to play.\u201d\n\nThe Raiders had been counting on Brown to spark an offence that lacked playmakers a year ago. Brown had 686 catches and 9,145 yards receiving the past six seasons in Pittsburgh, the best marks ever for a receiver in a six-year span. But now they must move on without him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an emotional thing for me,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI was very hopeful about what he could bring here. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not going to happen. He\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s misunderstood by a lot of people but he\u2019s a good guy, a great player and I hope he gets what he\u2019s looking for.\u201d\n\nAP", "description": "Antonio Brown agreed to terms with the New England Patriots hours after the Oakland Raiders cut him, going from the NFL\u2019s cellar to the defending Super Bowl champions on Saturday despite wearing out his welcome with two teams in one off-season.", "authors": ["Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/08/10/Antonio-Brown.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
