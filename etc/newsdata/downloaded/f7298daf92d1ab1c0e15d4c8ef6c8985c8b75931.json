He received a sweetheart deal and walked free in 2011.\n\nBut he was arrested again in July this year after federal prosecutors accused him of trafficking \u201cdozens\u201d of underage girls between 2002 and 2005. He was held in New York City\u2019s Metropolitan Correctional Center as he awaited trial on the new charges, but was found dead in his cell on August 10.\n\nHis death was a cause for despair among his accusers, who desperately wanted Epstein to face his day in court.\n\nREAD MORE Victims Of Accused Predator Jeffrey Epstein Angry After His Death In Prison\n\nQuestions have also been raised about the circumstances leading to his death: the staff tasked with guarding him reportedly fell asleep and didn\u2019t check his cell for three hours on the night of his death, while two camera outside his cell were found to be nonoperational.\n\nThis leads us to Dr. Michael Baden. Speaking on Fox & Friends overnight, Dr. Baden, who was hired by Epstein\u2019s brother to attend the autopsy, said \u201con day one, there were findings that were unusual for suicidal hanging, and more consistent with ligature homicidal strangulation.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Dr Baden was concerned with a break in Epstein\u2019s hyoid bone \u2013 a small bone which rests below the Adam\u2019s apple. He said fractured hyoid bones are more commonly found in people who\u2019ve been strangled to death than those who have died by hanging.\n\nHe called the circumstances leading to Epstein\u2019s official cause of death \u201cextremely unlikely,\u201d echoing conspiracy theories that Epstein\u2019s rich and powerful friends may have feared the incriminating consequences of Epstein facing trial.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen it in fifty years of investigating all deaths that occur in prisons in New York State,\u201d Dr. Baden said.\n\n\u201cThe issue would be that somebody [would] come in and cause his death,\u201d he added.\n\nA key thing to keep in mind here is Baden\u2019s bias as a paid consultant for the Epstein estate, but the original reports about the hyoid bone detail caused other experts to take pause. While it\u2019s not conclusive evidence of strangulation, it is another detail that skeptics have used to build an alternative narrative of Epstein\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe issue\u2026 doesn\u2019t mean this is a homicide, but certainly it deserves investigation, and the brother is concerned there is no investigation,\u201d Dr Baden said.\n\nExpect the speculation around this particular case to continue for a long time yet.\n\nIf you require immediate assistance, please call 000.\n\nIf you are in distress, please call Lifeline on 13 11 44 or chat online.\n\nUnder 25?
