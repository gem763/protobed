We have started already. Hopefully we can win back-to-back [World Cups]. Who\u2019s to say we can\u2019t?\n\n\u2018Everyone is around the same age in the group we have got together. We will be together for a lot more years.\u2019\n\nAfter the World Cup final ended in a tie, it was Archer who England captain Eoin Morgan turned to to bowl the Super Over.\n\nDespite being hit for a six by Jimmy Neesham, Archer successfully defended 15 as England were awarded victory courtesy of their superior boundary count.\n\nReflecting on the final, Archer added: \u2018I was not nervous at all \u2013 probably because I didn\u2019t realise until about 30 seconds before. Anyone could have bowled the Super Over.\n\n\u2018We were never not going to get another chance. If we lost there is always another game. At the moment it is still early in my career.\u2019\n\nAfter starring in England\u2019s triumphant World Cup campaign, Archer made a superb start to his Test career by taking 22 wickets in four matches in the drawn Ashes series.\n\nArcher has made a superb start to his Test career (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I thought I would be pretty OK \u2013 that I would stand on my own two feet in Test cricket,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think it\u2019s gone gone a bit better than I expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You never know where cricket can take you in two weeks, two months or a year. You never know what that one of game will do, cricket wise or mentally. Anything is possible.\u2019\n\nArcher also discussed the ECB\u2019s new Hundred competition after being selected as the England Test player for Southampton-based team Southern Brave.\n\n\u2018There is enough time in the year to play everything,\u2019 he added. \u2018I think it is time to try something new and we never know where this might lead.\u2019", "description": "Jofra Archer insists England are capable of becoming the first team to win back-to-back World Cups.
