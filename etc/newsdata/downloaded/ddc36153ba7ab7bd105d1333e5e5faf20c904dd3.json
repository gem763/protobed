No one else's way, just my decision.\n\n'Each and everyone has steps to get to where it's forgiving. I went through those faster than others. Understand she is a human being. She still deserves love. She made a mistake that she probably truly regrets.\n\n'I waited one year to hear I'm sorry and I'm grateful for that.'\n\nJean's 18-year-old brother Brandt Jean was interviewed separately on Good Morning America on Friday where he spoke of the astonishing moment he embraced Guyger in the courtroom following the sentencing\n\nIn a remarkable act of forgiveness, Brandt embraced Guyger and told his brother's killer that he loved her and he didn't want to see her jailed\n\nThe scenes from inside the courtroom when Guyger was sentenced for the September 2018 shooting death of Jean in his own apartment quickly prompted widespread reaction.\n\nThe jurors on the case only learned about the hug between Jean's brother and Guyger the following day.\n\nThey have also since spoken out, saying that news of the hug made them feel comfortable with their decision to sentence Guyger to 10-years in prison.\n\nTwo of the jurors revealed to Good Morning America that deciding on Guyger's punishment was 'one of the hardest things' they've had to do and that they thought about what the slain 26-year-old would have wanted for the cop that fatally shot him.\n\nGuyger was facing anywhere between five years to life in prison after she shot dead Jean in his own Dallas apartment in September 2018 when she mistakenly entered thinking it was her own.\n\nProsecutors had pushed for a 28-year sentence but jurors on Wednesday settled on a decade instead - a decision some had argued didn't equate to justice for Jean.\n\n'They were asking for 28 years. I'm going to honest and true, I can't give her 28 years. I know a lot of people aren't happy about the 10 years but I felt this case was not like any other case,' the black female juror said.\n\nAmber Guyger (right) was sentenced to 10 years prison on Wednesday for fatally shooting 26-year-old Botham Jean (left) in September 2018 when she claims to have mistakenly entered his apartment believing it was her own\n\nTwo of the jurors revealed on Friday that deciding on Guyger's punishment was 'one of the hardest things' they've had to do and that they thought about what the slain 26-year-old would have wanted for the cop that fatally shot him\n\n'You can't compare this case to any of those other officers killing unarmed black men. Those officers that killed unarmed black men, when they got out they went back to living their lives.\n\n'Amber Guyger, ever since she killed that man, she hasn't been the same. She's shown remorse. She's going to have to deal with that for the rest of her life.\n\n'One thing Botham can teach us all is that we should all love each other instead of hate each other. If Botham would have gotten just shot and not killed, I think he would have forgiven Amber Guyger.'\n\nHer fellow juror, a white male, said there was a lot of crying when they were trying to decide on Guyger's punishment following an emotional week-long trial.\n\n'After hearing about how his family talked about him... he was kind and caring and forgiving. I told everyone, I'm really having a hard time with this because we all agree it was a mistake and I don't Bo would want to take harsh vengeance,' the male juror said.\n\n'There's no way we could ever know what he would want. But I think we all had to make a decision that we could live with.\n\n'I felt like he would forgive her.'\n\nBertrum and Allison Jean spoke to their slain son Botham's church congregation in Dallas on Wednesday night just hours after Amber Guyger was convicted of his murder.

The Freedom From Religion Foundation claimed that State District Judge Tammy Kemp 'inappropriately proselytized' to the defendant when giving the convicted murderer a personalized bible during sentencing. The non-profit stated in the Thursday filing that the judge violated the 'constitutional principle' when she 'gifted a Christian bible, instructing the convicted criminal on how to read the bible and which passages to pay attention to, and witnessing to that convicted murderer.' 'These proselytizing actions overstepped judicial authority, were inappropriate and were unconstitutional,' the Wisconsin-based organization added. FFRF cited courtroom video that shows the four-minute exchange between the judge - who is black - and Guyger after the convicted killer was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The non-profit acknowledged that the moment was 'emotional'. 'It is perfectly acceptable for private citizens to express their religious beliefs in court, but the rules are different for those acting in a governmental role,' FFRF said.\n\nJean's parents, Allison and Bertrum, spoke at their son's church congregation soon after the sentencing.\n\nThey addressed the astonishing moment their 18-year-old son embraced Guyger. They agreed that while they were prepared to forgive Guyger, her actions of killing their son had to have consequences.\n\n'We don't hate you, (Amber). You have broken us but we would like to become friends at some point in time, I believe I have the ability to do it, despite my loss. God is good. That is why I want to do this,' Bertrum said.\n\nSpeaking of Brandt's act of compassion towards Guyger, Bertrum said he wasn't surprised because that is how they had raised him.\n\n'I appreciate what Brandt did but there are consequences for actions,' Bertrum said.\n\nAllison later added: 'What Brandt did today was remarkable, it is what we have been taught to do... but I don't want the community to be mistaken by what happened in the court room.\n\n'Forgiveness for us as Christians is a healing for us, but as my husband said there are consequences. It does not mean that everything else we have suffered has to go unnoticed.\n\nAllison went on to criticize the Dallas Police Department for their handling of the murder investigation and urged the congregation to try make Dallas better.\n\n'What you saw and what you heard in the courtroom really showed what your system is and you must seek to do something about it. You saw a contaminated crime scene, you saw deletion of evidence by persons in high offices. You saw turning off of body cams and saw cameras in the vehicles,' she said.\n\n'You saw investigations that were marred with corruption and throughout the trial what I kept saying to myself is: 'Botham was a child of God and we know he did not deserve what he got'. The most hurtful part is for me that even after he was shot, he was left to die.\n\n'There are many Christians who asked me if I would forgive Amber. I will leave my forgiveness for Amber to myself. God knows my heart.'\n\nKemp handed over her own personal Bible to Guyger before she was taken away to begin her prison sentence\n\nJudge Tammy Kemp embraced Guyger (left) and gave her her Bible just moments after also hugging Jean's mother Allison (right)\n\nIn addition to Jean's younger brother hugging Guyger after the sentenced was handed down by the jury, the convicted cop was also embraced by Judge Tammy Kemp.\n\nKemp handed over her own personal Bible to Guyger before she was taken away to begin her prison sentence.\n\nCritics also blasted Judge Kemp, who is black, calling her embrace of Guyger inappropriate and deeply offensive.\n\nGuyger was sentenced on Wednesday by the same jury that convicted her a day earlier of murdering Jean.\n\nShe was off duty from the Dallas Police Department but still in uniform when she fatally shot the 26-year-old accountant in his own home in September 2018.\n\nGuyger said she mistook Jean's apartment for her own, which was one floor below, and that she thought he was an intruder when she opened fire.\n\nFollowing an emotional six-day trial, prosecutors had urged the jury to give a punishment of no less than 28 years, which is how old Jean would have been if he was still alive.\n\nGuyger's defense attorneys had asked them to show leniency because she believed she was in her own apartment and acted out of fear.", "description": "In a remarkable act of forgiveness, Brandt Jean told his brother's killer that he loved her and he didn't want to see her jailed just moments after she was sentenced in Dallas on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/14/19297958-0-image-a-315_1570195255962.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
