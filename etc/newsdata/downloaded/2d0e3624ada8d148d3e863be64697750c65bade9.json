Organic variants were $1.71 on average.\n\nOther varied green skin varieties were recorded to be $2.00 or less.\n\nThese prices are cheaper than what avocado lovers experienced in July\u2014which had a reported weighted national average of $2.10 per avocado.\n\nDavid Maga\u00f1a, vice president and senior analyst at the California-based Rabobank told USA TODAY that the wholesale price for midsized, Mexican avocados has also decreased more than 50 percent from July. The wholesale price for a 25-pound box is currently around $40, which is down from the July spike that put a 25-pound box at $84.25, he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPrices are back to normal levels,\u201d Maga\u00f1a said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we were expecting as the Mexican harvest season is now ramping up and at full production.\u201d\n\nPile of green Avocados. One of them is opened that the stone and the pulp are visible.\n\nA consumer survey from the online market statistics portal Statista estimates that Americans demanded over 2.4 billion pounds of avocados in 2018.\n\nThat increased demand for avocados coupled in with fluctuating prices has created a shortage for the fatty berry. Harold Edwards, president and CEO of produce giant Limoneira, told USA TODAY that the nation\u2019s weekly demand is nearly 60 million pounds.\n\nJust like with any shortage, a change in quality is usually expected. Some Chipotle customers around the country have noticed a plunge in the restaurant chain\u2019s guacamole\u2014which has gone from a vibrant and smooth green to a stringy brown with unripe chunks in some areas.\n\nMany have gone to social media with their complaints seeing as the Denver-based franchise charges extra for the dip.\n\nTwitter user @jim_malcom shared his dissatisfaction in seeing brown guacamole at his local Chipotle. \"Yikes, result of avocado shortage or spoiled food,\" he asked the chain publicly in a direct tweet Sept. 15.\n\nAnother user by the name of @MalTullio shared her displeasure with an up-close shot of her delivered guacamole container. \"I'm very disappointed,\" she tweeted to Chipotle on Sept. 11.\n\nA Twitter account named SaveTheGuac was created in August and been aggregating tweets from disgruntled Chipotle customers and their surprising brown guac finds.\n\n\"Four weeks ago Chipotle told their supplier to get the cheap avocados. We don't want no sloppy, stringy, hard, bland avocados,\" the account has written in its Twitter bio at the time of this article.\n\nChipotle\u2019s Chief Reputation Officer Laurie Schalow addressed customer concerns in a statement to TODAY Food.\n\n\"Due to the seasonal transition from Peruvian to Mexican suppliers that happens every year at this time, we are experiencing normal variabilities in our avocados but we can assure our customers that our guac is still being freshly prepared in our restaurants every day,\" Schalow explained.\n\nAccording to a report by Forbes, close to 90 percent of avocados come from Mexico. The Latin country is also the largest supplier of agricultural imports to the U.S., according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\nLast year, the U.S. paid a reported $26 billion in agricultural imports, which included $5.8 billion in fresh fruit, as well as $1.7 billion in processed fruit and vegetables.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Sept. 16 marks National Guacamole Day, which is just in time for the national dip in avocado prices.
