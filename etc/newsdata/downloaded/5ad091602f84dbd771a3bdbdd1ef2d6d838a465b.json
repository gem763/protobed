USA TODAY\n\nIt was another wacky week in Pac-12 play with the biggest surprise being Washington's 23-13 loss to Stanford, which was down to its third-string quarterback and six healthy offensive linemen by the end of the game.\n\nThat loss takes much of the shine off what most thought would be a North division title showdown between Washington and Oregon on Oct. 19 but it's now the Ducks - unbeaten in the conference - firmly in control with Oregon State the only team with fewer than two losses.\n\nArizona used a 35-30 win at Colorado to pull atop the South standings although its toughest games are yet to come.\n\nArizona quarterback Khalil Tate carries the ball during the first quarter against Colorado at Folsom Field.

Five schools have had their starter injured and two of those \u2014 Southern California and Stanford \u2014 have had to go to a third quarterback.\n\nSeveral other key position players have been out as well so what understudies deliver could go a long way in determining the outcome moving forward.\n\n1. Oregon (4-1, 2-0)\n\nPrevious: 1\n\nThe No. 13. Ducks got off to a slow start but rode a tenacious effort from the defense to a 17-7 win over visiting Cal. They overcame three turnovers, one more than they had in the previous four games combined, and regrouped in the second half after going into halftime down 7-0. Senior QB Justin Herbert was a steady 20 of 33 for 214 yards.\n\nNext up: Friday vs. Colorado, 7 p.m., FS1\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nRE-RANK: Ohio State takes over as the latest No. 1 in NCAA Re-Rank 1-130\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 6 in college football\n\n2. Utah (4-1, 1-1)\n\nPrevious: 3\n\nThe No. 15 Utes had a bye and hope to have star running back Zack Moss back in the lineup for their next game. He is just 176 yards shy of the program's career rushing record held by Eddie Johnson (3,044 from 1984-88). Despite the loss to USC, Utah remains a threat to win the South.\n\nNext up: Saturday at Oregon State, 8 p.m., Pac-12 Network.\n\n3. Arizona (4-1, 2-0)\n\nPrevious: 10\n\nGuess what? The Wildcats, who didn't even make a bowl game last year, sit first in the Pac-12 South after a 35-30 win over Colorado in a game that featured nine lead changes. Of course they have yet to play any of the top contenders and have tough back-to-backs coming up against Washington and USC. Khalil Tate returned and threw for 404 yards to ignite the victory.\n\nNext up: Saturday vs. Washington, 11 p.m., FS1\n\n4. Arizona State (4-1, 1-1)\n\nPrevious: 5\n\nThe Sun Devils had a bye and needed it with a lot of key players missing or injured after a physically tough 24-17 win at California. That win and the one earlier over Michigan State give ASU two road wins over ranked teams, something few other teams in the country can claim, but this is a young team and with that come ups and downs.\n\nNext up: Saturday vs. Washington State, 3:30 p.m., Pac-12 Network.\n\n5. Southern California (3-2, 2-1)\n\nPrevious: 7\n\nThe Trojans had a bye which gives QB Kedon Slovis another week to get through concussion protocol with the annual showdown against a non-conference rival looming. The question is which USC team will show up because inconsistency has been a trademark and the hot seat isn't cooling down for coach Clay Helton.\n\nNext up: Saturday at No. 10 Notre Dame, 7:30 p.m., NBC\n\n6. Colorado (3-2, 1-1)\n\nPrevious: 4\n\nThe Buffaloes could not hold off Arizona losing 35-30 at home. WR Laviska Shenault did not play, but Colorado got another stellar effort from Tony Brown who had 10 catches for 140 yards. Defense let the Buffaloes down again, surrendering 487 yards and failing to contain QB Khalil Tate. That has to be disappointing because head coach Mel Tucker's forte is defense.\n\nNext up: Friday at No. 13 Oregon, 10 p.m., FS1\n\n7. Stanford (3-3, 2-2)\n\nPrevious: 9\n\nThe Cardinal may be without seven offensive lineman and down to their No. 3 quarterback Jake West but proved capable of a big win with a 23-13 upset of Washington. Stanford used a ball-control offense to shorten the game and give the Huskies limited possessions. Time of possession favored Stanford 39:01 to 20:59. Stanford has three losses but has best strength of schedule in conference.\n\nNext up: Oct. 17 vs. UCLA.\n\nCARDINAL RULE: Scarlett's career day helps Stanford beat No. 15 Washington\n\n8. Washington (4-2, 1-2)\n\nPrevious: 2\n\nTrap game? Perhaps. Few could have predicted a 23-13 loss to an injury-decimated Stanford team, but the Huskies were dealt a crucial blow to their North division title hopes and now have to regroup before facing an energized Arizona team, then Oregon. Problematic was Washington's 2-for-13 on third down conversions which contributed to Stanford finishing with almost a 2-1 advantage in time of possession.\n\nNext up: Saturday at Arizona, 11 p.m., FS1.\n\n9. Washington State (3-2, 0-2)\n\nPrevious: 8\n\nIt is hard for a team to make news in an off week, but that was the case as Cougars defensive coordinator Tracy Claeys stepped down. The Air Raid offense has been fine form but the defensive issues have been noteworthy as the Cougars are giving up 444.4 yards per game and have allowed 105 points in the last two games alone. The 0-2 start in conference play is the team's worst since 2012.\n\nNext up: Saturday at No. 24 Arizona State, 3:30 p.m., Pac-12 Network.\n\n10. California (4-2, 1-2)\n\nPrevious: 6\n\nThe Golden Bears are one of five schools to have to rely on a backup quarterback at some point this season and the going was tough for Devon Modster (17-for-34, 190 yards, 2 interceptions), who was in for the injured Chase Garbers. The Cal defense held its own early, but the offense couldn't find the end zone in the second half.\n\nNext up: Oct. 19 vs. Oregon State.\n\n11. Oregon State (2-3, 1-1)\n\nPrevious: 12\n\nJake Luton threw for 285 yards with a career-high five touchdown passes as the Beavers stormed out to a 21-0 first quarter lead and never looked back, chalking up a 48-31 victory. Isaiah Hodgins had another 10 catches for 123 yards giving him a Pac-12 best 43 for 632 yards on the season. If the OSU defense can keep making progress the Beavers could surprise.\n\nNext up: Saturday vs. Utah, 8 p.m., Pac-12 Network.\n\n12. UCLA (1-5, 1-2)\n\nPrevious: 11\n\nThe Bruins have shown they can score, but they haven't been able to stop anyone either as was the case in a 48-31 loss to Oregon State. That now makes UCLA 4-14 in Chip Kelly's tenure. The team is very young, but the fan base is getting impatient. One of the few positives was the performance of QB Austin Burton who threw for 236 yards replacing the injured Dorian Thompson-Robinson.\n\nNext up: Oct. 17 at Stanford, 9 p.m., ESPN.", "description": "There were some major changes in the Pac-12 power rankings with Arizona rising after beating Colorado and Washington falling with a loss to Stanford.", "authors": ["Michelle Gardner", "Published P.M.
