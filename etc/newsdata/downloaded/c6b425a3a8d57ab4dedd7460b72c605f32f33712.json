At the same time, Hunter insisted there was nothing improper or unethical about his employment with the company.\n\nFollowing the interview, a number of well-known Republican figures weighed in to criticize Hunter Biden for cashing in on his father\u2019s name. And they all had one thing distinctly in common with the ex-veep\u2019s son.\n\nAppearing on MSNBC, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), son of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), a libertarian icon who twice ran for the Republican nomination, seemed to suggest the government ought to investigate Hunter Biden and his dynastic connections\u2014but once MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle asked him if that also applied to the president\u2019s family, Paul suddenly sang a different tune.\n\n\u201cIf we want to go down the road of the politics of self-destruction of everybody,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cCriminalize all politicians on both sides of the aisle and go after their family, we can do that. But both sides are doing that, nobody really should excuse themselves and say, \u2018We\u2019re holier than thou and Trump is evil,\u2019 instead of saying, \u2018It looks like there\u2019s been a lot of self-dealings throughout history.\u2019\u201d\n\nPaul, meanwhile, went on to brush off any further questions about whether it\u2019s appropriate for a president to ask a foreign leader to dig up dirt on a political opponent or whether the Trump family\u2019s self-dealings are an issue, instead insisting that the Bidens need to be investigated.\n\nAnd then over on ABC\u2019s chatfest The View, Meghan McCain, daughter of the late Sen. John McCain\u2014the 2008 Republican presidential nominee\u2014felt that Hunter didn\u2019t do a \u201cgreat job,\u201d feeling that part of the problem is he admitted to his nepotistic benefits.\n\n\u201cI think it was some criticism that\u2019s been held against other politicians\u2019 children,\u201d she added. \u201cI always say it\u2019s like being in a mafia family and you all roll together, you know what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d\n\nBut it was the decidedly anti-nepotism responses of two other famous legacy cases, however, that really drew attention on Tuesday.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, the niece of 2012 Republican presidential nominee and current Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, took to Twitter shortly after Hunter\u2019s interview aired to post a scorching hot take.\n\n\u201cHunter Biden got $50K a month from a Ukrainian energy company, despite having ZERO experience in energy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHis justification? That he was also on the board of Amtrak\u2013more obvious nepotism. If that\u2019s not the swamp, I don\u2019t know what is!\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before \u201cMs. Romney,\u201d \u201cRonna Romney,\u201d and \u201cRomney McDaniel\u201d were all trending on Twitter. (McDaniel famously removed Romney from her name after Trump reportedly pressured her to do so over his long-running feud with the former GOP standard-bearer, something she has denied.)\n\nThe coup de gr\u00e2ce, meanwhile, was delivered by none other than the president\u2019s own son.\n\n\u201cDumpster fire at Biden HQ!\u201d Donald Trump Jr. tweeted without a hint of irony. \u201c\u2018It is impossible for me to be on any of the boards I just mentioned without saying that I\u2019m the son of the vice president of the US. I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happen in my life that if my name wasn\u2019t Biden\u2019 Hunter Biden.\u201d\n\nReactions, especially from the president\u2019s critics, quickly came pouring in.\n\n\u201c[P]eople are dunking on jr for this but honestly i bet it\u2019s incredibly peaceful and zen-like to have zero self-awareness,\u201d humorist and commentator Andy Levy tweeted.\n\n\u201cThe kind of introspective joke you make when you owe your job and your entire career path to your father and think that other people are screw-ups or corrupt for exactly the same reason,\u201d Bloomberg Opinion writer Tim O\u2019Brien noted.\n\n\u201cWorld record achieved - and likely never to be broken - for self-unaware projection,\u201d The Intercept\u2019s Glenn Greenwald observed.", "description": "Four famous legacy cases\u2014Donald Trump Jr., Rand Paul, Meghan McCain, and Ronna Romney McDaniel\u2014all weighed in on Hunter Biden\u2019s family ties on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571170925/191015-baragona-nepotists-tease_vgwra1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
