Photo: Getty Images\n\nFinally, the prophecy has been fulfilled! Years ago, it was spoken into existence that Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Danai Gurira would bring Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s Americanah to life onscreen. After five years and a movie that didn\u2019t happen, a brave hero, HBO Max, has completed the mission. The streaming service has ordered a ten-episode limited series for Americanah. Adichie\u2019s best-selling novel follows a Nigerian woman in the United States as she navigates \u201clove, heartache, adversity and self-discovery.\u201d Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Danai Gurira are re-reuniting for the project. Nyong\u2019o starred in Gurira\u2019s Broadway play, Eclipsed, then the pair became superheroes in Marvel\u2019s Black Panther. In 2014, it was announced that David Oyelowo would play Nyong\u2019o\u2019s love interest in Americanah\u2019s film version, but it\u2019s unclear if he will stay on for the series. Whoever it is, we\u2019re in for about ten hours of Lupita Nyong\u2019o excellence that we did nothing to deserve! Everyone say thank you to Mr. HBO Max.", "description": "HBO Max has picked up Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Danai Gurira\u2019s adaptation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s novel \u201cAmericanah.\u201d", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/13/13-lupita-nyongo-danai-gurira.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
