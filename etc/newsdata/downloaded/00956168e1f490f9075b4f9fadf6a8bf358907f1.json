It's had a big run up and that has just completely reversed in the last quarter. It looks like some restocking but I'm just not sure,\" Mr Fergie said.\n\n\"It really came out of left field and right after a director sell down, it doesn't look good.\"\n\nThe company's success has been driven almost solely by its Chinese connections, with 85.9 per cent of the company's revenue coming from the region in the second half of fiscal 2019.\n\nPhoslock has been fulfilling China's strong desire to clean up its air and waterways, with Beijing pledging to tackle pollution.\n\nIn 2014, Premier Li Keqiang said the country had declared \"war against pollution\" while a 2016 government report included a pledge to improve the nation's water quality by 2020.\n\nBut the business's heavy reliance on a region which has stung hopeful Australian investors in the past has left some feeling uneasy.\n\n\"There is a massive cohort of businesses that are China facing that have disappointed in the market,\" said Cyan's Mr Fergie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Even things like Bellamy's who've got a genuinely differentiated product that clearly the Chinese consumer loves, there's been regulatory issues.\n\nSince the establishment of its Chinese subsidiary, Phoslock has made less than $10 million revenue outside of Asia.\n\nMr Fergie said a number of other companies had shown just how short lived success in China could be.\n\n\"You'll have a period where there's really strong demand and then it just disappears,\" he said.\n\n\"Even small changes to demand from such a big end customer can hurt small companies. There's a lot of volatility and it's hard to gauge or predict any medium term demand outcome.\"\n\nBut the company's sensational performance has left it with no shortage of fans.\n\nGlenmore Asset Management was among the best performing fund managers in the last 12 months, with its backing of Phoslock giving it a strong 12 month return.\n\nRegals Fund Management also picked up a stake in Phoslock through the middle of the year seems, excited by the market potential of its water cleaning product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The recent contract wins in both China and the US validate the product and we would expect an acceleration of further contracts over coming years, as customers see the product in practice,\" said Regal chief investment officer Phil King.\n\n\"The weak quarterly cashflow is typical of companies ramping up production ahead of increased sales and quarterly cashflows for companies with a small number of customers can be lumpy.\"\n\nHe added the company would likely expand its customer base outside Asia with strong demand from across the globe.\n\n\"Although most revenue currently comes from China, there is huge interest from both Europe and North America and over time we think the revenue source will be more diversified.\"", "description": "Phoslock has been among the best performing stocks on the market this year but heavy selling from the company's directors may be a cause for concern.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.683%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_167%2C$y_229/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/50b479892e426dd8a2fb387009a2a04318accf36", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
