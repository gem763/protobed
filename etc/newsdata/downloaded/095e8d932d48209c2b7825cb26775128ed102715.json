The president\u2019s attorneys also may need to go back to the drawing board if they\u2019re going to defeat lawmakers\u2019 newly emboldened demands \u2014 some already sitting before federal judges \u2014 seeking critical documents and testimony in a wide range of investigations launched over the past nine months.\n\nThe bottom line: The very real threat looms that all manner of Trump\u2019s dirty laundry is about to be aired for the American public as Congress tests its constitutional powers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident the White House will be treating this with the seriousness it requires,\u201d said Ty Cobb, a former top Trump White House attorney who helped spearhead the president\u2019s official response during special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe.\n\nTrump\u2019s challenge is unlike anything he\u2019s faced before in politics since he first launched his longshot presidential bid in 2015. This isn\u2019t a debate stage. And it\u2019s not even the same as the oversight Democrats have been pursuing since they took control of the House at the start of the year.\n\nImpeachment instead takes things to a whole new level, where the lawmakers considering a president\u2019s removal have unique legal rights to extract information and then present their findings in a Capitol building that essentially gets turned into a courtroom.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\n\u201cHis primary defense is political, and I assume he\u2019ll be blustering he needs no defense and that he\u2019s done nothing wrong, which is just categorically false,\u201d said Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor and author of a frequently cited book on impeachment.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s typical punch-first defense may end up being more trouble than it\u2019s worth, Gerhardt warned. \u201cThe defiance itself could become impeachable,\u201d he said.\n\nFor their part, Trump and his lawyers have long publicly downplayed the threat from impeachment \u2014 all the while building up an entire counter-strategy around the idea of ensuring it would go nowhere politically if Democrats ever launched the process.\n\nDuring the Mueller probe, for example, they acknowledged they were attacking the special counsel with the express purpose of sullying the former FBI director\u2019s reputation in the eyes of Republicans and independents whose support they couldn\u2019t afford to lose.\n\nSince Democrats won the House, the Trump game plan has centered around stonewalling lawmakers\u2019 demands and forcing them into legal battles that could extend well beyond the next election. At the same time, the president and his attorneys have taunted their investigators with the argument that an ill-fated impeachment bid that\u2019s bound to die in the GOP-led Senate will help the president win sympathy and ultimately lead to his winning a second term in 2020.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clown show and I don\u2019t have any respect for it,\u201d John Dowd, who previously served as one of the president\u2019s personal lawyers, said on Tuesday of the Democrats as they were nearing their impeachment inquiry announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have any idea what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s current lawyers insist they won\u2019t need to make any major course corrections on their legal and political strategies, which they argue helped to outlast the Mueller probe during nearly two years of scrutiny and now is well positioned to surmount House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats.\n\n\u201cImpeachment helps us politically but hurts the nation,\u201d Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said in a text message to POLITICO. \u201cThey don\u2019t care. Sometimes out-of-control hatred can cloud judgment. All I can do is hit them back when they swing and miss.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nJay Sekulow, another member of the president\u2019s personal legal team, said in an interview that he didn\u2019t expect Trump to seek significant new resources for impeachment, which he dubbed \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just handled the biggest investigation in recent history with a legal team that did quite well,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident if we need to reassemble that team we can. I still don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nTrump, of course, is no stranger to the legal profession. Before launching his political career, he cycled through attorneys faster than one of his spinning casino slot machines. He then brought that style from Fifth Avenue to the White House.\n\nMarc Kasowitz, one of Trump\u2019s longtime New York-based personal attorneys, for example, spent just a couple of months representing the president during the Russia probe in mid-2017 before being pushed out amid frustration over his client\u2019s behavior.\n\nMichael Cohen participated in early White House strategy sessions as the Mueller probe developed but later flipped and became a government witness who is now serving a three-year prison sentence for his role in a hush-money scheme involving an adult film actress that also implicated the president.\n\nDowd resigned as a Trump lawyer in March 2018 amid a larger shakeup that ultimately led to the president retaining Giuliani, the bombastic former New York mayor who has earned a reputation as the president\u2019s TV lawyer and primary attack dog.\n\nSeveral top attorneys have cycled through the White House, too. Don McGahn, the president\u2019s first counsel, earned praise from conservatives for his work helping Trump win confirmation for two Supreme Court justices. But McGahn also suffered the ire of the president for becoming one of Mueller\u2019s star witnesses who provided the special counsel with some of his most incriminating evidence about the president\u2019s efforts to stymie and outright kill the Russia probe. Cobb\u2019s efforts to cooperate with Russia investigators drew criticism from the president\u2019s allies who questioned the need for such an open kimono approach. Then came Emmet Flood, who won over Trump with a more combative style that included a letter that slammed Mueller\u2019s final report as a \u201claw school exam paper.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s current White House counsel\u2019s office, led by Pat Cipollone, has a team of about 20 attorneys specifically assigned since the start of the year to aggressively pushing back on Democratic congressional oversight requests.\n\nWhite House Counsel Pat Cipollone. | Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nPelosi\u2019s decision to make impeachment a real thing means many of those government lawyers may be asked to transition over to the issue, too, potentially to the detriment of their other workloads.\n\n\u201cIf history teaches anything in the recent past significant impeachment proceedings, the White House counsel is actively involved and needs to be in order to work through the constitutional issues,\u201d explained Cobb, who has spent decades in Washington on both sides of multiple past special counsel probes.\n\nOn the personal legal front, legal experts expect Trump will need to expand his circle and find more attorneys and perhaps even approach a law firm that has a deep bench of associates who can handle some of the grunt work connected to impeachment.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to prepare people to testify and have to respond to people who are testifying and saying damaging things about them,\u201d said Solomon Wisenberg, a former deputy on independent counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation of President Bill Clinton. \u201cThey\u2019ll need some real constitutional people, not just white collar people.\u201d\n\nNow that they\u2019ve launched a formal impeachment investigation, Democrats are expected to have greater legal authority in their attempt to gather documents and interview witnesses compared with a more traditional oversight process. The issue is likely to be front and center in early October when a federal judge holds a hearing on the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s lawsuit seeking access to Mueller\u2019s most sensitive evidence and testimony collected before a grand jury. In a brief filed earlier this month, the Justice Department argued the Mueller materials should remain off-limits in part because the House hadn\u2019t yet launched itself on an impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi is leaning on the work of six key committees in the Democrats\u2019 expansive new impeachment effort. That means even the single issue at the center of the new impeachment push \u2014 the president\u2019s admitted attempt to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and his family, as well as Giuliani\u2019s role in the matter \u2014 could turn into a sprawling review of larger questions surrounding Trump\u2019s dealings with his political rivals and foreign governments.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3744/1155968404_6089157105001_6089152801001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nIn a sign of its apparent seriousness over a looming impeachment battle, Trump\u2019s White House on Tuesday signaled it may give to Congress by the end of the week the whistleblower complaint and inspector general report that go to the heart of the Ukraine matter. The president also said he\u2019s authorized the release on Wednesday of a \u201ccomplete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript\u201d of his phone call with the Ukrainian president where he discussed the Biden investigation.\n\nSeveral names are nonetheless already kicking around in the Trump legal world that the president may turn to in mounting a more forceful defense against impeachment. The list starts with Flood, who left the White House in June and hasn\u2019t yet announced a new job. \u201cThey\u2019ll want him back,\u201d Wisenberg predicted.\n\nCobb suggested a number of other prominent impeachment experts who have backed Trump on cable TV who also should merit a look. He mentioned retired Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz and Jonathan Turley, a Georgetown University law professor who defended former U.S. District Court Judge G. Thomas Porteous during his 2010 impeachment. The Bill Clinton appointee became just the eighth federal judge to be convicted by the Senate in U.S. history during a trial led in part by California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, now the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and an instrumental figure in the Trump impeachment effort.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d be an excellent choice and a strong advocate given his constitutional expertise,\u201d Cobb said of Turley.\n\nThe former White House attorney added, \u201cThere are several competent lawyers that\u2019d be available on this. I think the president\u2019s existing legal team could get additional support from many quarters if they conclude they need it.\u201d\n\nSekulow dismissed the idea he\u2019s going to need to make significant additions.\n\n\u201cWe have plenty of constitutional lawyers already on the team,\u201d he said, noting his own experience arguing a dozen cases before the Supreme Court and the background of William Consovoy, an attorney based in Arlington, Va., who clerked for Clarence Thomas and who has taken a lead role in several lawsuits to protect the president\u2019s tax returns.", "description": "The House\u2019s new impeachment inquiry will test Trump\u2019s army of lawyers \u2014 and the president\u2019s rhetoric that this is actually good for him and Republicans come 2020.", "authors": ["Darren Samuelsohn"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/70/6a/732754c549d78c251747daeea532/190924-giuliani-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
