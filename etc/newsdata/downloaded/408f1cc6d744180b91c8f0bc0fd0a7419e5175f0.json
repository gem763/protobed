The market\u2019s pundits saw policy makers getting dragged into a series of aggressive rate cuts, as the U.S. and China drew battle-lines over tariffs and the global growth outlook worsened.\n\nIncreased optimism on both fronts this month has buckled that trend. For the first time this year, markets are converging to the Fed\u2019s view that interest rates aren\u2019t headed much lower, as Chairman Jerome Powell suggested this week when the Fed delivered its second quarter-point rate cut in a row. January fed fund futures contracts are now pricing in just one more in 2019, and Vice Chairman Richard Clarida Friday seemed amenable to that.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to the Fed and readjusting its expectations,\u201d said Putri Pascualy, a portfolio manager at Pacific Alternative Asset Management Co.\n\nShe points out that this is \u201ca meaningful change from what\u2019s been going on this year, where the question was whether the Fed was behind the curve and it was going to accelerate rate cuts to meet market expectations.\u201d\n\nAt the height of the Treasury market\u2019s headlong rally in August, when fears of a global recession reached a fever pitch, fed fund futures were pricing in a September cut and as much as a half-point more by year end. As of now, they\u2019re positioned for barely a quarter point.\n\nIn eurodollar option markets, a growing number of traders are cashing out of dovish bets, with the latest purge coming in the U.S. morning Friday. The positions taken out stood to benefit from an additional 50 basis points of Fed cuts this year.\n\nTraders are also now charting a shallower path of rate cuts for next year, with the target rate now seen falling to 1.3% by the end of 2020, according to the January 2021 contract, versus 0.9% anticipated as of Sept. 4.\n\nThat said, over the past week rate cut positioning for next year has begun to rebuild, on the basis that the Fed\u2019s reluctance to cut now will simply force it to move later. That\u2019s the scenario in which this \u201cdata dependent\u201d Fed is finally confronted with enough evidence to confirm that U.S. growth is in fact worsening.\n\nJudging by the Fed\u2019s updated views on the path of rates, policy makers have clearly become more receptive to easing. Their \u201cdot plot\u201d of projections shows seven members now envisage another rate cut this year -- back in June, none saw it getting that low. A slim majority still sees no cut at all through this year or next, and none project more than one. Policy makers will have more than enough opportunity to elaborate on this diversity of opinions in the coming week, when many -- including two of the three dissenters to this latest vote -- are slated for speaking engagements across the country.\n\nThe belief among some investors that easing may simply be delayed is borne out in the shape of the Treasury yield curve, says BNP Paribas SA head of G-10 rates strategy, Shahid Ladha. A sell-off at the front of the curve, on dimmed expectations for easing, has pushed it flatter. And buying in long-dated Treasuries has contributed to the move. That buying, Ladha said, reflects a pretty strong suspicion that while further cuts may not be imminent, they\u2019ll have to be made.\n\n\u201cEven if it takes a little longer for the Fed to deliver the next cut, the long end remains convinced it is coming,\u201d Ladha said.\n\n(Adds reference to upcoming Fed speakers in 10th paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Edward Bolingbroke.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Emily Barrett in New York at ebarrett25@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Dave Liedtka, Mark Tannenbaum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A reality-check on the threat of a recession is shaking the bond market\u2019s conviction on the extent of the Federal Reserve\u2019s easing cycle.For the first nine months of this year, wagers on the path of interest rates showed a widening gap between traders and the Fed.
