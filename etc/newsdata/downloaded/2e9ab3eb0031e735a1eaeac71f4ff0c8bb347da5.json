Marcell Ozuna, who was playing in his first career playoff game, gave the Cardinals their first lead of the game with a two-run double with one out in the ninth.\n\nBy winning Game 1 on the road, the Cardinals stole home-field advantage from the Braves.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nSt. Louis\n\nSP Miles Mikolas: five innings, three hits, one run, two walks and two strikeouts\n\nOF Dexter Fowler: 1-for-4, walk, RBI, run scored\n\n1B Paul Goldschmidt: 2-for-4, home run, RBI\n\nLF Marcell Ozuna: 2-for-4, walk, double, two RBI\n\n2B Kolten Wong: 2-for-4, walk, double, 2 RBI\n\nCF Harrison Bader: 1-for-3, stolen base, run scored\n\nAtlanta\n\nSP Dallas Keuchel: 4.2 innings, five hits, one run, three walks and zero strikeouts\n\nRP Luke Jackson: 0.2 innings, three hits, two runs, zero walks and one strikeout\n\nRP Mark Melancon (losing pitcher): one inning, five hits, four runs, two walks and one strikeout\n\nCF Ronald Acuna Jr.: 3-for-4, walk, home run, 2 RBI\n\n\n\n1B Freddie Freeman: 2-for-4, home run, RBI\n\nPaul Goldschmidt Trade Pays Off for Cardinals\n\nWhen St. Louis acquired Goldschmidt last offseason, it envisioned the first baseman coming up clutch in the postseason.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nKeuchel and Co. held the Cardinals offense in check for much of the first seven innings. But when Braves manager Brian Snitker had to adapt on the fly following an injury to reliever Chris Martin, Goldschmidt found a way to spark his team.\n\nOn the second pitch from Martin's replacement, Luke Jackson, Goldschmidt launched the ball deep into the second deck in left:\n\nAs Christopher Kamka of NBC Sports Chicago noted, Goldschmidt has made a habit of doing yardwork in October:\n\nHis latest blast brought St. Louis to within one run and proved to be just the beginning of a comeback.\n\nMatt Carpenter later evened the score with a two-out blooper:\n\nAnd that set the stage for Ozuna and Wong to play the role of hero in the ninth:\n\nThe Braves made things interesting with three runs in the bottom of the ninth, but the Cardinals held on\u2014and it's all thanks to a bold offseason move.\n\nCardinals Overcome Rare Miscues\n\nWhether it be rust or just tough luck, the NL Central champs made some uncharacteristic mistakes in their first postseason game since 2015.\n\nAnd it nearly cost them.\n\nRust appeared to be an issue for Mikolas early on, as he entered Game 1 on 10 days' rest. Making his first appearance since Sept. 22, he started the game by walking back-to-back batters and subsequently giving up a base hit to the third hitter. If not for a caught stealing, he could have been in serious trouble right out of the gates.\n\nHe nearly escaped the jam altogether, but second baseman Kolten Wong\u2014who had not played since Sept. 19 due to a hamstring injury\u2014mishandled a potential inning-ending double play:\n\nMikolas would eventually settle in, retiring 11 in a row at one point. And that bought his team some time to hang around.\n\nThe Braves loaded the bases against the Cardinals bullpen in the bottom of the sixth. St. Louis had an opportunity to escape the inning with the score tied 1-1, but third baseman Tommy Edman was unable to field a hard-hit ball by Dansby Swanson. Matters were made worse when the throw from shortstop Paul DeJong got away from Wong, allowing a second run to score.\n\nThis was a Cardinals team that committed the fewest errors (66) in baseball during the regular season.\n\nAtlanta's first three runs scored on plays involving an error. It wasn't until the ninth that the Braves managed to manufacture runs on their own.\n\nFortunately for the Cardinals, the offense did just enough to pick up the defense.\n\nWhat's Next\n\nGame 2 will be played at SunTrust Park on Friday at 4:37 p.m. ET. Right-hander Jack Flaherty will take the mound for St. Louis, while right-hander Mike Foltynewicz will get the nod for Atlanta.", "description": "The St. Louis Cardinals used a late offensive outburst to rally for a 7-6 victory over the Atlanta Braves in Game 1 of the 2019 National League Division Series at SunTrust Park on Thursday...", "authors": ["Kyle Newport"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/831/310/hi-res-d6ef8ea7a21014818f0c077f894c3bc3_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
