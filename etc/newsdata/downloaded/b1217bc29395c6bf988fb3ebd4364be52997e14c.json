He made some very big mistakes when he talked about the Libyan model for Kim Jong Un,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, after announcing the administration would seek to prohibit the sale of flavored e-cigarettes. \u201cThat was not a good statement to make. You just take a look at what happened with Gadhafi. That was not a good statement to make. And it set us back.\u201d\n\nTrump was referring to a remark by Bolton nearly a year and a half ago, describing Libya as a model for the denuclearization of North Korea. Moammar Gadhafi, the longtime Libyan dictator, agreed to give up his nuclear-weapons program in 2003 in exchange for the lifting of U.S. economic sanctions. Eight years later, Gadhafi was overthrown and killed by rebels, who were supported by NATO airstrikes.\n\nForeign-policy experts believed Bolton\u2019s statement was counterproductive to Trump\u2019s goal of reaching an agreement with Kim. When Trump took his historic step across the border into North Korea, Bolton was not part of his entourage. He had been relegated to a meeting in Mongolia.\n\nCiting administration officials, several media outlets reported this week that tensions between Trump and Bolton came to a head over the president\u2019s invitation to Taliban representatives to peace negotiations at Camp David. That meeting, had Trump not canceled it at the last minute, would have taken place this week, on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which were planned by Osama bin Laden, who was living at the time in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton outside the White House in May.

Bush \u2014 an invasion Trump has described as a mistake (although also, at times, as a good idea).\n\n\u201cHe was very out there, I can tell you, and wanting to have them do it, and I disagreed with that decision from the beginning,\u201d Trump said, without explaining why he had picked Bolton as his national security adviser in the first place.\n\n\u201cFrankly he wanted to do things \u2014 not necessarily tougher than me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cJohn\u2019s known as a tough guy. He\u2019s so tough he got us into Iraq. That\u2019s tough. But he\u2019s somebody that I actually had a very good relationship with, but he wasn\u2019t getting along with people in the administration who I consider very important.\u201d\n\nTrump added: \u201cAnd you know John wasn\u2019t in line with what we were doing. And actually in some cases he thought it was too tough, what we were doing. Mr. Tough Guy.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump in the Oval Office on Sept. 11, 2019.
