And they all feature in his brand new book, The World (by teNeues), which is a treasure chest of his unpublished images from all seven continents.\n\nThe book isn't cheap. It costs \u00a3225 (250 euros/$300) for the unsigned 'special edition' and \u00a3850 (999 euros/$1200) for the hand-signed 'collector's edition'.\n\nBut it contains a sensational body of work. Two hundred and eighty colour images by a photographer at the very top of his game who has trained his lens on earth's most jaw-dropping environments - dramatic volcanoes in Iceland, bizarre rock formations in Australia, lush mangrove forests in Thailand, penguins in the icy Antarctic and much more.\n\nMichael said: 'Part of me wants to keep these landscapes hidden, a secret shared between myself and the wilderness. But I also hope that in showing these pictures - and in beginning to take people to my favourite spots in the world on private tours - more people will be motivated to protect something of the beauty, and fragility, they see in the world.'
