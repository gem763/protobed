I was in Sana and watched Jamal using his Twitter account to cheer the bombs falling on my city. On the ground in Sana, I saw men, women and children fearful and bloodied. Sometimes we would both be quoted \u2014 disagreeing \u2014 in articles or interviews about the war. He was a believer, a campaigner for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.\n\nThat is why his murder caused such fear and horror. Jamal was not a dissident. He believed in Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nAt the end of the summer of 2017, Jamal and I were at a conference in Washington, where he spoke passionately about the Arab Spring, the rise of Prince Mohammed and his Vision 2030 plan for economic diversification of the kingdom.\n\nJamal was excited about Prince Mohammed\u2019s vision, especially the plan to nationalize jobs. He had written a book titled \u201cThe Occupation of the Saudi Market,\u201d calling, more or less, for the expulsion of foreign laborers from Saudi Arabia. We sharply disagreed about it \u2014 millions of Yemenis depend on remittances sent home from relatives working in Saudi Arabia \u2014 but we listened to each other with respect and open hearts.\n\nTwo days after the conference, we met for dinner in Washington. At a certain point, Essam al-Zamil, a Saudi economist, joined us. Jamal was happy because he had found a house and was furnishing it. I asked him whether I should take that as a sign that he planned to settle there. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied. I understood that Jamal no longer felt safe in Saudi Arabia.\n\nI did not see either of my dinner companions again. Saudi intelligence officers were waiting for Mr. al-Zamil when he arrived the next day at the airport in Riyadh. They took him to a prison and he has not been seen since. Like Jamal, Mr. al-Zamil supported the Saudi government; when we met he was in Washington promoting Vision 2030. His apparent mistake was publicly questioning the wisdom of Prince Mohammed\u2019s plan to float shares in Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company.\n\nPrince Mohammed was known for his unpredictability, but Jamal\u2019s murder placed him squarely in the league of global rogues. Across the Arab world, intellectuals, writers, activists and ordinary citizens are censoring themselves because when they don\u2019t, governments do.", "description": "After the Saudi columnist\u2019s murder, intellectuals, writers and activists across the Middle East are increasingly censoring themselves out of fear of their governments.", "authors": ["Farea Al-Muslimi"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/opinion/02Muslimi1/02Muslimi1-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
