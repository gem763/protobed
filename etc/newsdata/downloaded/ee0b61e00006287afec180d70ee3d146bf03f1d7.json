The five-year (2014-2018) average for injections, in comparison, was at 73 bcf.\n\nDominick Chirichella, director of risk and trading at the Energy Management Institute in New York, said temperatures should remain above normal across most of the United States over the next two weeks, with the heat peaking between days 6 and 10.\n\nSaid Chirichella: \u201cSummer will not give up yet as above-normal temperatures are generally favored.\u201d\n\nThrough the year to last week, the weather was warmer than normal with 82 cooling degree days (CDDs), against a 30-year average of 66. CDDs measure the number of degrees a day's average temperature is above 65 Fahrenheit (18 Celsius) and are used to estimate demand to cool homes and businesses.\n\nMatter Of Time Before Stockpiles Start Spiking\n\nChirichella, however, cautioned that with the \u201cshoulder season\u201d for gas demand already in\u2014a period that typically runs between mid September and October\u2014it was a matter of time before gas stockpiles begin spiking from near record high production of the fuel.\n\nAccording to data firm Refinitiv, gas production in the Lower 48 U.S. states rose to 92.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) last week, which was close to the daily record high of 93.0 bcfd on Aug. 19.\n\nChirichella added:\n\n\u201cEven with several heat waves this summer, the injection season has been robust with the surplus over last year continuing to grow, while the deficit versus the five-year average is almost gone.\u201d\n\nDaniel Myers, gas analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston, concurred, saying:\n\n\u201cOnce the heat lets up, injections in late September could pick back up quickly as additional supply hits the market.\u201d\n\nSo, what does this mean for gas prices?\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s settlement, the benchmark contract on New York Mercantile Exchange\u2019s Henry Hub fell 2.8 cents, or 1%, to $2.55 per million metric British thermal units (mmBtu).\n\nNatGas 300-Min Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nEven so, the contract was headed for a weekly gain of almost 2% after accounting for Monday\u2019s near 4% jump. If natural gas closes the week higher, it would be its third straight weekly gain, after surging 9% and 6% in the previous two weeks.\n\nPrices Between 'Too Expensive' And 'Too Cheap'\n\nSaid Scott Shelton, energy futures broker at ICAP (LON: ) in Durham, North Carolina:", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: NEX Group PLC, Natural Gas Futures.
