They are then assembled into final products, ranging from control panels for tractors to medical imaging machines, in factories closer to customers, including in the United States.\n\nThe survey from the IPC, based in Bannockburn, Illinois, found that one in five companies with U.S. operations said they were investing less in the United States due to the new tariffs. About 13% said they were cutting hiring or reducing headcount.\n\n\u201cIt seems clear that loss of profitability is impacting the ability of these companies to invest in the U.S.,\u201d said Shawn DuBravac, IPC\u2019s chief economist.\n\nDuBravac said many association firms had indicated they were leaving China, but \u201cit doesn\u2019t appear from our results that a lot of that is flowing back to the U.S.\u201d Rather, the focus is on moving to other low-cost countries, including Vietnam and Malaysia, he said.\n\nBrad Heath, chief executive of VirTex, an Austin, Texas-based manufacturer, said he paid over $200,000 in tariffs for Chinese electronics parts last month on behalf of his clients.\n\nVirTex is a contract manufacturer, which means it assembles parts into sub-assemblies for bigger companies. It can usually pass costs through to final customers, Heath said.\n\n\u201cBut our customers don\u2019t have that ability,\u201d he added. \u201cSo someone is suffering margin erosion.\u201d\n\nThe IPC survey found many companies were struggling to pass along tariff costs, with more than a third saying they could not increase their prices to compensate for them.\n\nNearly 70% said tariffs had eroded their profit margins, according to the survey, which also said just over half of companies were now sourcing from countries outside China to avoid tariffs.", "description": "U.S. electronics factories are investing less and slowing hiring or laying off workers in some cases due to the rising costs of trade tariffs, according to an industry survey set for release on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Timothy Aeppel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444083932&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0XQ", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
