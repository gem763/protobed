This interpretation was received on Friday, 30 August, 2019, and was that the filing failure which Usada had recorded in June 2018 should relate back to April 1, 2018, the first day of the quarter in which the failure to update occurred.\n\nThe Usada chief executive, Travis Tygart, said his organisation accepted the ruling. \u201cConsistent application of the global anti-doping rules is essential in every case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must approach every case with the primary goal of delivering fairness to athletes under the rules and providing transparency and consistency in order to build their trust and support for the anti-doping system.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery athlete is entitled to a presumption of innocence until their case is concluded through the established legal process. This is certainly the case for Mr Coleman, who has been found by Usada not to have committed a whereabouts violation and is fully eligible to compete under the rules.\u201d\n\nLast month Coleman, who has been tested on 20 occasions between 2018 and 2019 and still has two missed tests on his record, said he had done nothing wrong. \u201cI\u2019m not a guy who takes any supplements at all, so I\u2019m never concerned about taking drug tests, at any time.\u201d", "description": "Christian Coleman, the fastest man in the world this year, has had a Usada charge of missed drug tests dropped, clearing him to go for gold in the Doha championships", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/878029458f5e4e3bfda6b97f34a71f194fde2893/529_489_4877_2926/master/4877.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=47ac3f1f1d3e607b93648511e4614c3b"}
