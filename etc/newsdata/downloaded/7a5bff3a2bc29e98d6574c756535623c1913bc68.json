And that might just be the beginning in an offseason of change for the franchise.\n\nPresident of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi begins his second offseason with the Giants and topping his list will be finding a manager to replace Bochy, who won three World Series titles during his 13-year Bay Area tenure. He went out with a surprise send-off in Sunday\u2019s 9-0 defeat to the Dodgers featuring dozens of former players on hand.\n\n\u201cSo it was an emotional roller coaster going on the whole day,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cThis is a day I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\n\nThe 64-year-old Bochy, who guided the Giants to World Series championships in 2010, \u201812 and \u201814, finished 2,003-2,029 in 4,032 games as a manager over 25 seasons, the first 12 with San Diego before 13 in San Francisco. He went 1,052-1,054 with the Giants, who wound up 77-85 in his final year and with four more wins than last season.\n\n\u201cWe obviously came up short so it\u2019s a disappointment in that respect,\u201d first baseman Brandon Belt said. \u201cWe fought every day.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco lost popular third baseman Pablo Sandoval to Tommy John surgery in early September, likely ending his second and final stint with the club.\n\nHere are some things to think about as the Giants head into the offseason:\n\nFREE AGENT MADBUM\n\nBumgarner will command a huge contract and could very well sign elsewhere as the Giants move forward with a younger roster and smaller payroll.\n\nBumgarner refused to get wrapped up in the speculation about whether he would be gone midseason, calling it \u201cjust noise.\u201d The Giants exercised his $12 million contract option for this year, the last in a $35.56 million, six-year deal he signed in April 2012 that included $12 million club options for both 2018 and \u201819.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll make my way back here one way or another,\u201d he said.\n\nCUETO\u2019S RETURN\n\nJohnny Cueto returned from a 13-month absence following Tommy John elbow reconstructive surgery to make four starts in September.\n\nThe Giants will count on him as a leader at the front end of the rotation in 2020.\n\nThe 33-year-old Cueto completed the fourth season of a $130 million, six-year contract he signed before the 2016 season.\n\nMANAGERIAL SEARCH\n\nOne of the first big orders of business for Zaidi will be finding Bochy\u2019s replacement, but that could meaning waiting until coaches on playoff teams are done - so it\u2019s unclear what that timetable will look like.\n\nBochy said he\u2019s willing to help in the process if Zaidi asks, but isn\u2019t going to interfere.\n\nPOSEY\u2019S YEAR\n\nBuster Posey\u2019s power numbers didn\u2019t improve with a new hip. The six-time All-Star had hoped to hit far better after returning from season-ending right hip surgery in August 2018, but he hit just .257 with seven home runs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can give you the exact specifics on exactly what I\u2019m going to work on. I\u2019ve got an idea, but I\u2019ll take a little mental, physical break, and then get back after it,\u201d Posey said.\n\nYet Bochy praised Posey for his consistency catching and working with pitchers despite the offensive struggles.\n\n\u201cI think it says a lot about him. He\u2019s really kept his concentration behind the plate handling these pitchers, his throwing, everything,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cHe\u2019s as good as he ever was back there. Sometimes you let the hitting affect other aspects of your game but he hasn\u2019t done that at all. He\u2019s done a tremendous job of handling these pitchers. The hitting part, you can have an off year and get that figured out. Through all that, the most important job for a catcher is handling the pitchers trying to find a way to win ballgames and he\u2019s been relentless with doing that.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, he batted .284 with five home runs and 41 RBIs while limited to 105 games. Even throwing seemed to put more stress on his shoulder with the troublesome hip, which needed repair for a torn labrum as well as removal of an impingement.\n\nREGULAR ROSTER MOVES\n\nThe roster looked different by the day and while the Giants kept Bumgarner at the trade deadline despite speculation he might be dealt, they swapped relievers Mark Melancon, Drew Pomeranz and Ray Black.\n\nSecond baseman Joe Panik was released in early August in one of the moves Bochy considered among the hardest of his 25-year managerial career.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An era is over, that's certain.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Janie Mccauley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/dodgers_giants_baseball_84693_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
