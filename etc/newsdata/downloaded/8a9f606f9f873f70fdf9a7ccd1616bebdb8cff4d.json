(AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a law banning most animals from circuses.\n\nThe law exempts rodeos and does not apply to domesticated dogs, cats and horses. California is now the third state to enact such a ban, joining New Jersey and Hawaii.\n\nCircuses have been declining in popularity. The most well-known act, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, closed in 2017 after 146 years of performances.\n\nAt least 18 circuses don\u2019t use animals at all, including Cirque du Soleil.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Ben Hueso, who authored the bill, said animals in circuses endure cruel training and near constant environment.
