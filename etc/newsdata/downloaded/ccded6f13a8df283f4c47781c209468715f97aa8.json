It's really, really good news.'\n\nSpeaking of the happy news, she wrote on social media: 'I know what mother feels so I have tears of joy. I am so proud of this sensational news. Andrew and I are just the luckiest people ever to have two great son-in-laws.'\n\nFergie shared a string of images, revealing that her younger daughter Eugenie, 29, had a hand in taking the colour photographs of Beatrice and Edo released by the couple.\n\nSpeaking at the glitzy event, the Duchess of York (pictured) said: 'It can only be Britain and anyway don't believe what you read'\n\nSarah Ferguson took to Instagram following the happy news and penned: 'I know what mother feels so I have tears of joy. I am so proud of this sensational news' Pictured, Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in an official engagement picture\n\nPreviously, royal expert Ingrid Seward claimed Princess Beatrice would like to get married in Italy 'in her heart' but will likely plump for England as the Queen 'won't fly to Europe for the wedding.'\n\nEdoardo comes from a family of Italian aristocrats and proposed to Beatrice, whom he has been dating since late last year, during a romantic trip to the country last month, which saw them staying in the exclusive cliffside village of Positano, on the Amalfi Coast.\n\nBut the expert told how their wedding, likely to take place in spring next year, will have to be in the UK to accommodate for Her Majesty.\n\nSpeaking to OK magazine, she said: 'I think in her heart Beatrice would like to be married in Italy where Edo's from, but there's no way the Queen will fly to Europe for the wedding so it will have to be in England.'\n\nIngrid added that Beatrice is 'more pliable' than her sister Princess Eugenie and will feel more pressure to 'keep everyone happy' when it comes to organising her big day.", "description": "Sarah Ferguson, 59, has told how her daughter Princess Beatrice, 31, 'can only' get married in Britain.
