Yonhap via REUTERS\n\nThe plan, which Hyundai said encompasses autonomous, connected and electric cars as well as technology for ride-sharing, comes after the automaker and two of its affiliates announced an investment of $1.6 billion in a venture with U.S. self-driving tech firm Aptiv (APTV.N).\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s government is also onboard, unveiling more funding for autonomous vehicle technology with President Moon Jae-in declaring on Tuesday that he expected self-driving cars to account for half of new cars on the country\u2019s roads by 2030.\n\n\u201cThe self-driving market is a golden market to revitalize the economy and create new jobs,\u201d Moon said in a speech at Hyundai Motor\u2019s (005380.KS) research center near Seoul.\n\nThe government intends to spend 1.7 trillion won between 2021 and 2027 on self-driving technology. It expects Hyundai to launch level 4, or fully autonomous, cars for fleet customers in 2024 and for the general public by 2027, an industry ministry official told Reuters.\n\nBut some experts question whether targets set by the government and the automotive group, which also includes Kia Motors Corp (000270.KS), are realistic given the technological and cost challenges and the lack of home-grown technology.\n\nIn a 45-page report on future automotive technology, the government acknowledged South Korea lags in some key areas necessary for self-driving cars such artificial intelligence, sensors and logic chips.\n\n\u201cHyundai has to buy technology from someone else because it lacks software technology. Even though it has a lot of cash, this could become a financial burden if its earnings deteriorate,\u201d Esther Yim, an analyst at Samsung Securities, said.\n\nOther analysts noted that the prospects for self-driving cars are quite murky.\n\nGeneral Motors Co\u2019s (GM.N) self-driving unit, Cruise, said in July it was delaying the commercial deployment of cars past its target of 2019 as tech firms and automakers acknowledge it will take more time and money than they had expected to make autonomous vehicles safe for unrestricted use on public roads.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s government said it would prepare a regulatory and legal framework for autonomous cars and the safety questions they pose by 2024.\n\nIt is also aiming to lay the technological and legal groundwork for demonstrations of flying cars by 2025. Hyundai Motor\u2019s executive vice chairman Euisun Chung said last month that the company is looking at developing flying cars.\n\nHyundai has also received much government backing for hydrogen fuel cell cars, with Moon calling hydrogen power the \u201cfuture bread and butter\u201d of Asia\u2019s No. 4 economy and declaring himself an ambassador for the technology.", "description": "Hyundai Motor Group said it plans to invest 41 trillion won ($35 billion) in mobility and other auto technologies by 2025, part of which will be directed to an ambitious effort to become more competitive in self-driving cars that has also received government backing.", "authors": ["Hyunjoo Jin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441011131&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0CY", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
