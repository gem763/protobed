(AP) - A bird-like sculpture that\u2019s been a fixture at the Indiana University-Kokomo campus since 1965 has gotten a much-needed face-lift.\n\nDecades of exposure to the elements had left the sculpture known as \u201cThe Phoenix\u201d riddled with cracks that marred the stainless steel, epoxy and fiberglass artwork.\n\nBut the Kokomo Tribune reports that a Detroit restoration company called Venus Bronze Works recently spent a week restoring the sculpture.\n\nThe campus\u2019 physical facilities director, John Sarber, says the sculpture now looks \u201cbrand new.\u201d Its restoration was financed by money set aside for art restoration during IU\u2019s bicentennial celebration.\n\nThe sculpture was designed and built by Robert Hamilton, a firefighter who took classes at the campus. It was installed outside IU-Kokomo\u2019s Main Building in 1965 and has long been an iconic campus fixture.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Kokomo Tribune, http://www.ktonline.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A bird-like sculpture that's been a fixture at the Indiana University-Kokomo campus since 1965 has gotten a much-needed face-lift.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
