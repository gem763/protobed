His deal with Top Rank and ESPN is worth a reported $100m, and this is his second consecutive fight headlining in Vegas.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt comes at a great time,\u201d he says red baseball cap on back-to-front. \u201cAnd isn\u2019t it a great thing that a total outsider from this country is showing so much love, passion and respect for the Mexican people who, at the minute, are being oppressed by the people here \u2013 building a wall, chucking \u2018em all out and treating them terrible.\n\n\u201cEvery Mexican person I\u2019ve met has shown love, respect and honour. They\u2019re God-fearing people. I don\u2019t know what is going on but it is nice to see a total stranger, heavyweight champion of the world, coming here and respecting people and paying homage to their beliefs and special days.\u201d\n\nOne of the signature campaign promises of Donald Trump's successful campaign to become President in 2016 was to 'build a wall' along the Mexico/America border and 'make Mexico pay for it'. He has since allocated billions of dollars to begin the construction along huge parts of the 2,000 mile border.\n\nNow Fury believes he feels a deep connection with the Mexicans living in America due to his own experiences growing up as a traveller in England.\n\n\u201cI 100 per cent know that feeling,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up around it, I\u2019ve been brought up around it.\n\n\u201cBut this weekend is a very special time; it is when the Mexicans became independent of Spain. Up until a few days ago, I thought it was when the Mexicans became independent from America.\n\n\u201cThat was a bit of educational information for me, I don\u2019t know what I will do with it. It is one of those things that you store and bring it back up in five years maybe as a quiz question.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big celebration. I was told there is going to be a lot of Mexicans here, it\u2019s a big celebration. We have Mexicans on the team, we have our trainer Jorge.\n\n\u201cHe has been with us for the last few camps here. We have got a lot of Mexican influence around us here. We show respect to all cultures and religions and all walks of life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the Mexican shorts, the Mexican gloves, the Mexican mask, the Mexican music, the Mexican flag. I don\u2019t know how much more respect I can show.\u201d\n\nBoxing on Mexican Independence Weekend has become synonymous with Las\n\nVegas ever since the days of the nation's idol Julio Cesar Chavez. Oscar De La Hoya assumed the mantle once Chavez retired before Floyd Mayweather cashed in on the date himself in the latter years of his career.\n\nMexico's latest superstar Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez has since made the date a cornerstone of his annual calendar but when he decided to push his next fight date back into the winter, Fury took full advantage.\n\n\u201cThat is quite a list of names there,\u201d he says. \u201cThe funny fact of it was Canelo was supposed to box this weekend here in Vegas but for whatever reason he decided not to.\n\n\u201cBut I stepped up for the Mexican people because they were not going to have big boxing on this date for the first time in a long time.\n\n\u201cI brought the fight forward four weeks in order to do this. Good job I stayed fit. I am in shape and always ready. It was supposed to be in New York in October but I decided to bring it forward and box on a special date.\n\n\u201cAfter I beat Tom Schwarz in June, this is the second fight back to back and I'm starting to feel like part of the furniture here.\n\n\u201cMy face is as popular now as David Copperfield\u2019s is on the MGM. It is everywhere.\u201d\n\nTyson Fury takes on Otto Wallin live on BT Sport Box Office this Saturday and the fight can be watched through BT Sport Box Office on BT TV, Virgin TV, Sky, online via the web or the BT Sport Box Office App.", "description": "On his\u00a0Las Vegas debut 13 weeks ago, Tyson Fury wore Stars and Stripes\u00a0and emerged to James Brown's seminal track Living in America while\u00a0flanked by Sin City showgirls.
