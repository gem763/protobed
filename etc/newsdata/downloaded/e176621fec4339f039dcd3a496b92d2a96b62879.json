He remains in police custody.\n\n(Image: Thames Valley Police)\n\nBut police are searching for others they believe were involved in the incident.\n\nDetective Chief Superintendent Ian Hunter, Head of Crime for Thames Valley Police, said: \"We are still looking for others and they know who they are. I want to appeal directly to those people. We are looking for you and we will find you, however long it takes.\n\n\u201cAt this stage we have not released your names or photographs, so please hand yourself into the nearest police station as soon as possible. This is not going to go away and if we have to, we will name you so there will be no place for you to hide.\n\n\u201cI also want to remind anybody helping or assisting these people that we have arrested and prosecuted for the serious offence of assisting offenders before and we will do so again if necessary.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nDCS Hunter said there were still \"very important\" witnesses who had not yet come forward with vital information about the incident - and some who were \"refusing to assist\".\n\nHe added: \u201cI know there will be various reasons for being reluctant to get involved but please, please think about the fact that Dom and Ben have been killed and how you would feel if this was your family.\n\n\u201cI imagine you would want justice and you wouldn\u2019t want people to get away with what they have done. I am sure you would want justice for your own family.\n\n\u201cI would ask therefore for you to think about this and do the right thing.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOne of the boys died at the scene and the other in hospital several hours later.\n\nDetectives said Dom was knifed in the back and Ben was stabbed in the chest at the private 23rd birthday party.\n\nTwo other males, a 17-year-old boy and a 23-year-old man, also suffered injuries as a result of this incident and are recovering.\n\nChandler was due to appear at Milton Keynes Magistrates Court today.\n\n(Image: Vagner Vidal/Hyde News & Pictures Ltd)\n\nThe families of both boys have released a joint tribute to the teenagers.\n\nDom's family said: \"Our loveable, cheeky son, Dom, was the light of the family\u2019s life and the other half to Holly, his twin sister, who is only half the person she will ever be now that Dom has gone.\n\n\u201cDom had big hopes and dreams for his future, which he will now never get to fulfil.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to describe as a family how we will get over this.\n\n\u201cDom was loved and cherished by his family and friends and will continue to be missed daily.\u201d\n\n(Image: Vagner Vidal/Hyde News & Picture)\n\nDescribing Ben as a \"gentle giant', his family said: \u201cOur son Ben was a gentle giant with the most caring and loving nature you could have ever asked for.\n\n\u201cBen will always be loved by all his family and friends, forever.\n\n\u201cBen was a younger brother to Jake, who is absolutely devastated to have had him taken from him.\n\n\u201cWe all as a family are blessed to have had our loving, funny, ambitious Benny Boy in our lives for the 17 years, and we are so devastated that he has gone.\u201d\n\n(Image: Cliff Hide/LNP)\n\nDCS Hunter added: \u201cWe continue to support the families of Dom and Ben and I can\u2019t begin to understand how devastating the last week has been for them.\n\n\u201cThis is a challenging investigation led by the Thames Valley Police Major Crime Unit and as you would expect we are working extremely hard to establish exactly what happened and find those responsible.\n\n\u201cFinally, I would again like to thank the public for all of their assistance. We know such dreadful events have such a deep impact on all those involved.\u201d", "description": "Thames Valley Police are threatening to release their names and pictures to the public while they add that \"very important\" witnesses are \"refusing to assist\"", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Thames Valley Police", "Pa", "Vagner Vidal Hyde News", "Pictures Ltd", "Picture", "Cliff Hide Lnp"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706802.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Milton-Keynes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
