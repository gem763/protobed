Koch and Meir were supposed to install more new batteries in a spacewalk next week, but had to venture out three days earlier to deal with an equipment failure that occurred over the weekend. They need to replace an old battery charger for one of the three new batteries that was installed last week by Koch and fellow NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan.\n\n\"Jessica and Christina, we are so proud of you. You're going to do great today,\" Morgan radioed from inside as the women exited the hatch.\n\nKoch is seven months into an 11-month mission that will be the longest ever by a woman.\n\nNASA GLIMPSES SURFACE OF DISTANT ROCKY EXOPLANET\n\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine watched the big event unfold from the agency's headquarters in Washington.\n\n\"We have the right people doing the right job at the right time,\" he said. \"They are an inspiration to people all over the world including me.
