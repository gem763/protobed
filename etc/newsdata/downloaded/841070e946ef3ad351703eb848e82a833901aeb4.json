Oil prices slip again amid gathering gloom over global economy\n\n* Brent, WTI benchmarks fell more than 5% last week\n\n* Middle East tensions linger, deadly clashes in Iraqi unrest\n\n* U.S.-China trade talks to focus minds later in week\n\nBy Florence Tan\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday, extending last week's heavy losses, with traders fearing the global economic slowdown will weigh on future oil demand growth while pegging hopes for a rebound on progress in talks this week on ending the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nBrent crude futures edged down 24 cents to $58.13 a barrel by 0147 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was at $52.69, down 12 cents.\n\nBoth contracts ended last week with a more-than-5% decline after dismal manufacturing data from the United States and China, as the lingering row between the world's top economies hurts global growth and raises the risk of recession.\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Washington on Oct. 10-11 in the next, much-anticipated fresh effort to work out a deal.\n\nOn the supply side, a faster-than-expected resumption in Saudi Arabia's production after a Sept. 14 attack on key production facilities also exerted downward pressure on oil prices, although the Middle East remained tense. Iraq, the second-largest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, deadly anti-government unrest is posing the biggest security and political challenge so far to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi's year-old government. supply also faces facility repair and maintenance pressures.\n\nThe Buzzard oil field in the British North Sea has been shut for pipe repair work, a spokesman from China's CNOOC said on Friday. Buzzard is the main contributor to the Forties crude stream, the largest of the five North Sea oil grades that underpin Brent crude futures.\n\nMeanwhile Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Sunday it will close the Faregh oil field at Zueitina port for scheduled maintenance from Monday until Oct. 14.", "description": "Oil prices slip again amid gathering gloom over global economy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE2J0AZ-ORUBS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
