(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nFormer White House official Neomi Rao was formally sworn in Friday as the newest judge on the federal appeals court in Washington in a ceremony attended by prominent members of the legal community and high-profile figures from the Trump administration, where she once worked.\n\nFormer White House counsel Donald McGahn, who recommended Rao for the job and was instrumental in President Trump\u2019s successful judicial nominations, emphasized her diverse experience in government.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been on the field of play and made tough decisions at the highest levels,\u201d McGahn said, before alluding to Rao\u2019s difficult Senate nomination process. \u201cShe stood the test under pressure and adversity.\u201d\n\nAlso in attendance were two Supreme Court justices: Brett M. Kavanaugh, whom Rao replaces on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and Clarence Thomas, for whom Rao was a law clerk.\n\nThomas, who taught a course with Rao at George Mason University\u2019s law school, praised the judge for her intellect, work ethic and character.\n\nAfter being sworn in by Thomas, Rao, 46, addressed the standing-room-only courtroom filled by Washington\u2019s interconnected community of lawyers, judges, Justice Department officials and former Supreme Court law clerks.\n\n\n\nFormer White House Counsel Donald McGahn, who recommended Neomi Rao for the federal appeals bench, makes remarks at the investiture ceremony. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nRao, the former White House regulator czar, said she brings to the bench an up-close experience with the \u201cchecks and balances at work\u201d and a \u201cpractical understanding of the powers and limitations\u201d of the respective branches of government.\n\nShe is President Trump\u2019s second nominee on the influential D.C. Circuit. The first, Gregory Katsas, was Trump\u2019s deputy legal counsel and is also a former Thomas law clerk.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit is often referred to as the nation\u2019s second-highest court because it reviews high-profile cases involving separation of powers and government regulations, and because it has been something of a pipeline to the Supreme Court.\n\nRao was officially sworn in during a small ceremony in March and has already been hearing cases. She is one of three judges on the panel that will rule on whether Trump can block Congress from demanding eight years worth of records from his accounting firm.\n\n[Justice Thomas working behind the scenes to boost Trump's court nominee]\n\n\n\nMembers of the legal community and administration officials filled the courtroom. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nAt the Senate in February, Rao encountered resistance, including from Republicans, in part because of her controversial writings about date rape from her time as a college student at Yale in the 1990s. She apologized in a letter to the Judiciary Committee strongly condemning \u201csexual assault in all forms\u201d \u2014 and got support from high places.\n\nThomas worked behind the scenes, talking privately with at least two GOP senators to vouch for Rao\u2019s credentials.\n\nShe was confirmed in March on a vote of 53-46 \u2014 a tally that McGahn referred to Friday as a \u201clandslide by modern standards.\u201d\n\n[Neomi Rao pressed on past writings on date rape at hearing on her judicial nomination]\n\nRao had since 2017 led the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, where she worked to significantly scale back federal regulations. She spent a decade before that as a law professor and is a former Senate Judiciary Committee staff member and associate counsel to President George W. Bush.\n\nRead more:\n\nTwo years in, Trump\u2019s appeals court confirmations at a historic high point\n\nWilliam S.
