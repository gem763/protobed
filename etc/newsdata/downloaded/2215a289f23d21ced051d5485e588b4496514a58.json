The deal, which was the first of its kind, created BHR as a private equity fund to invest Chinese money overseas.\n\nThe timing of the lucrative deal has been brought into question as it came only 12 days after Hunter visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two. Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. In a March 2018 interview with Breitbart News Tonight, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden\u2019s $1.5 billion venture with China:\n\n\u201cIn December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, \u2018If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.\u2019 Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. For basically not challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.\u201d\n\nSince its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. As of June, Hunter Biden was still involved with BHR, sitting on its board of directors and owning a minority stake of the fund estimated to be worth more than $430,000.\n\nApart from the shadowy timing of BHR\u2019s inception, the company and Hunter Biden have also caught the eye of investigators in Congress for the purchase of a U.S. company with insight into military technology.\n\nIn 2015, BHR and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) \u2014 an aerospace and defense conglomerate owned and operated by the Chinese government \u2014 made a $600 million bid to purchase Henniges, a Michigan-based automotive company. The sale required approval from the Obama-Biden administration\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) as AVIC was a subsidiary of the Chinese government and Henniges produced \u201cdual-use\u201d anti-vibration technology with U.S. \u201cmilitary applications.\u201d CFIUS, which is made up of representatives from 16 different federal bodies including the Departments of State, Treasury, and Defense, is required to review any transaction with national security implications.\n\nWhen the AVIC and BHR\u2019s bid was first announced, alarm bells went off in certain sectors of the defense industry. In particular, many noted that AVIC was \u201creportedly involved in stealing sensitive data regarding the Joint Strike Fighter program,\u201d which it later \u201creportedly incorporated \u2026 into China\u2019s J-20 and J\u201131 aircraft.\u201d\n\nDespite the national security concerns, CFIUS approved the deal with AVIC, purchasing 51 percent of the company while BHR took ownership of the other 49 percent. Upon purchase, an industry newsletter stated the deal was the \u201cbiggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.\u201d\n\nAlthough the deal was approved by the Obama administration, it has not escaped congressional scrutiny. In August, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) launched a probe into whether or not the CFIUS decision was influenced by either Joe Biden or former Secretary of State John Kerry, whose stepson was also involved in the venture.\n\n\u201cThe direct involvement of Mr. Hunter Biden and Mr. Heinz in the acquisition of Henniges by the Chinese government creates a potential conflict of interest,\u201d Grassley noted when launching the probe.\n\nDespite the appearance of conflicts of interest, the Chinese government announced on Tuesday it would not probe into BHR or Hunter Biden\u2019s ties to the company.", "description": "Bohai Harvest RST, a firm bankrolled by the Chinese government, is weighing how and if it should explain its relationship with Hunter Biden.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/03/Joe-Biden-Hunter-Biden-China-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
