REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Europe\u2019s corporate recession is expected to deepen, according to the latest forecasts, as companies struggle with uncertainties from Brexit and the protracted U.S.-China trade spat and Germany\u2019s manufacturing recession.\n\nCompanies listed on the STOXX 600 regional index are now expected to report a drop of as much as 3.7% in third-quarter earnings, worse than the 3% fall expected a week ago, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n\nThat compares with growth of 14.4% in the year-earlier quarter and would be the worst EPS since Q3 2016 when earnings fell 5%.\n\nCompanies in the region have been in an earnings recession since the second quarter when earnings dropped 2.1%, their second straight quarterly fall.\n\nConsensus for revenue improved slightly with forecasts for flat growth, compared with a 5.9% rise a year ago and 3.3% growth in Q2.\n\nQ4 forecasts were reined in slightly - EPS is now expected to grow 9.1%, down from 9.6% last week and forecasts are for a 3.2% rise in revenue, down from 3.4% last week.", "description": "Europe's corporate recession is expected to deepen, according to the latest forecasts, as companies struggle with uncertainties from Brexit and the protracted U.S.-China trade spat and Germany's manufacturing recession.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441362500&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0BS", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
