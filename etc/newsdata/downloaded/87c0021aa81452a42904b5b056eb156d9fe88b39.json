That was the first and last time we've ever worked together. So this is a very different experience cause we'll be working together from the beginning.\"\n\nParker said the two discussed the play and decided the timing was right. She was just finished filming HBO's \"Divorce\" and was able to balance a Broadway schedule with the multiple projects she's working on under her \"SJP\" umbrella.\n\n\"You know, we're both actors and we're always looking for interesting parts to play and this play is funny and heartbreaking and it's one of Neil Simon's great achievements,\" she says. \"And so we I think are looking at it as actors and not as married people. It's more so as an opportunity to play great roles. We each get to play three different roles and we're really excited.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "Sarah Jessica Parker and her husband Matthew Broderick are gearing up to act together, which she says hasn't happened since 1996.", "authors": ["Marianne Garvey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190926062223-sjp-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
