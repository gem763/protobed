It\u2019s a store in a store. It\u2019s store-ception.\n\nColes opened the hybrid store at its Tooronga Village location in Melbourne, promising ready-to-eat bites from independent partners / beloved staples EARL Canteen and Sushi Sushi. A quality combo if I do say so myself.\n\nUsing their own staff and products, both companies have set up shop in the supermarket. On offer will be barista-made coffee and sushi rolls complete with Coles\u2019 Special Burger Sauce. Side note: I actually hadn\u2019t heard about the sauce before writing this yarn, so if you have no idea what it is either then you can check it out right here.\n\nIn classic fashion, Coles Chief executive Steven Cain named the hybrid Australia\u2019s first \u2018grocerant\u2019, which sounds like such a precious dad joke.\n\n\u201cThe market is going two ways,\u201d he told The Sydney Morning Herald. \u201cOne is towards value\u2026and the other is towards convenience. And that\u2019s what this store caters for.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of which, Coles\u2019 Head of Convenience Louis Eggar said the hybrid store is about \u201cmaking life easier for our customers by solving the problem of what to eat \u2013 for everyone, any time of the day.\u201d\n\nColes also revealed it has the mighty plan to covert another 100 stores into \u2018grocerants\u2019 before Christmas, which is rather soon. Cain said the company\u2019s keen to partner with local independent retailers in areas where Coles, uh, \u201cstruggles\u201d AKA where people may or may not prefer Woolies.\n\nREAD MORE A WA Mum Made A Vape Cake Out Of Woolies Mudboys For Her Very Cool Daughter", "description": "Supermarket juggernaut Coles just launched its first-ever concept store, a supermarket and\u00a0food hall hybrid.
