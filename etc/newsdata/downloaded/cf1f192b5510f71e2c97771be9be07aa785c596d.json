A leaked research paper suggests the company has achieved what is known as quantum supremacy, whereby a quantum computer performed a calculation that was far beyond the reach of today\u2019s most powerful supercomputers.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFirst theorised by the physicist Richard Feynman in 1982, quantum computers combine the peculiar properties of quantum physics with computer science to achieve processing power that is exponentially more powerful than traditional computers.\n\nInstead of using traditional bits \u2013 the \u20181\u2019s\u2019 and \u20180\u2019s\u2019 used to store and transfer data \u2013 quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. These exist in a state of superposition, meaning they can act as both a \u20181\u2019 and a \u20180\u2019 at the same time.\n\nBy not being restricted by a single binary state, each new qubit added to a quantum computing system makes it exponentially more powerful than its traditional counterpart.\n\nIn order to function, qubits need to be kept in extremely cold temperatures \u2013 close to Absolute Zero (-273C). This makes them both impractical and extremely costly to develop, but the potential advances that could be made mean the likes of Google, Nasa and the CIA are all attempting to build one.\n\nIf Google\u2019s leaked paper is to be believed, the technology giant may be leading the race to build this revolutionary new form of computer. A calculation that would take a traditional supercomputer approximately 10,000 years to perform, took Google\u2019s 72-qubit computer just 200 seconds.\n\nThe paper stated: \u201cThis dramatic speed-up relative to all known classical algorithms provides an experimental realisation of quantum supremacy on a computational task and heralds the advent of a much-anticipated computing paradigm.\u201d\n\nBut such power may come at a huge price. Tim Callan, a senior fellow at cybersecurity firm Sectigo, warns that the advent of these era-defining machines could result in what he refers to as a \u201cquantum apocalypse\u201d.\n\nAt threat are the current encryption technologies used in everything from popular messaging apps like WhatsApp, to online banking transactions. These RSA and ECC encryption systems are what prevent all of our data from being exposed to cyber criminals, hackers and spy agencies.\n\nGovernment, education, business and healthcare data could all be compromised by quantum computers, as they will be orders of magnitude faster than the calculations needed to break this encryption.\n\n\u201cWhile no one can definitively say when quantum computers will reach the point of defeating RSA and ECC, many estimates place that date in the next 10 or 15 years,\u201d Mr Callan tells The Independent.\n\n\u201cOur modern systems of finance, commerce, communication, transportation, manufacturing, energy, government, and healthcare will for all intents and purposes cease to function.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The risk posed by quantum computers is that their power could theoretically render such protection impotent.\n\nUK cybersecurity firm Post Quantum has described bitcoin as \u201cdefinitely not quantum computer proof\u201c and warned that if measures are not put in place, then \u201cbitcoin will expire the very day the first quantum computer appears\u201d.\n\nFortunately, there may be a solution. Work is currently underway to create quantum-resistant algorithms that would protect against the end of our digital world as we know it.\n\nLeading the effort to identify new ways to encrypt data is the National Institute for Standards and Technology (Nist) in the US. More than 20 potential algorithms are already being scrutinised by the agency, though it is too early to know if even one of them is suitable for the task.\n\nThe biggest challenge is for the encryption technology to not only protect against cyberattacks from quantum computers, but to also work with traditional computers and smartphones running on the current network infrastructure of the internet.\n\n\u201cQuantum computers will not replace binary computers. Rather, both architectures will go on to live side by side,\u201d Mr Callan says. \u201dTherefore, the encryption paradigms of the future need to withstand attack not only by quantum computers but by traditional computers as well.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr Callan puts the date of this potential quantum apocalypse as at least a decade away, other predictions suggest it could come much sooner.\n\nResearch into figuring out exactly how long it will take for quantum computers to reach this danger point is being pioneered by Michele Mosca, co-founder of the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo in Canada.\n\nThrough Mosca\u2019s reseach, this point has come to be known as the \u201cZ date\u201d, and was estimated in 2016 to have a 15 per cent chance of arriving before 2026. With Google\u2019s latest research, these odds may well have increased.\n\nMosca\u2019s seminal research paper concluded with a chilling warning: If quantum computers are to change the world, we must first find a way to save the world.\n\n\u201cHarnessing the power of quantum mechanics in large-scale quantum computers will allow us to solve many valuable problems for humanity,\u201d it stated.\n\n\u201cBut we must first take the catastrophic impact of breaking cybersecurity off the table by developing and deploying a suite a quantum-safe cryptographic tools before quantum computers arrive.\u201d", "description": "A new era of unfathomably fast computers is just a few years away, with quantum computers set to transform the way we communicate, cure disease, and even solve problems previously thought impossible.
