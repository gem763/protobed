(AP Photo/Vasha Hunt)\n\nNick Saban doesn\u2019t want to hear you criticize the quality of opponents that Alabama has on its schedule.\n\nThe Crimson Tide beat New Mexico State 62-10 on Saturday. The game was a week after New Mexico State, an independent team after parting ways with the Sun Belt, lost 58-7 at Washington State.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFollowing the blowout, which wasn\u2019t a contest at the end of the first quarter, Saban was asked what his team could learn from playing a team at the bottom of the FBS ranks. That led to an intriguing answer from Saban, who flatly said at one point that \u201cwe\u2019re playing the best teams that we can get to play us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you start calling around and see if you can get somebody else to play us and we\u2019ll play them,\u201d Saban said. \u201cWe\u2019ll play anybody you can get to play us.\u201d\n\nSaban\u2019s thoughts on college football scheduling are well-known at this point and he expressed them in the video above. He would love to play a schedule full of Power Five opponents.\n\nBut he also realizes that isn\u2019t possible. And besides, games like Saturday\u2019s are a great way for New Mexico State to help its athletic department. Alabama paid $1.7 million to the Aggies for the game. That money goes a long way for a school that doesn\u2019t get tens of millions in television dollars for being part of a power conference.\n\nAlabama has shifted its scheduling philosophy from major neutral-site games to home-and-home games in the near future. But power programs also like to have seven home games \u2014 or more \u2014 for their season ticket holders. And those teams get to have more home than road games by paying smaller teams to travel.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s the way college football scheduling works. It\u2019s far from perfect. But Saban has a legitimate point. Alabama beating New Mexico State by over 50 points may not be that entertaining. But it\u2019s a necessary evil.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Saban has said multiple times he would love to play only Power Five opponents.
