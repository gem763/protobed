However, in a statement last night the palace said Harry \u201ccan\u2019t wait\u201d to introduce their son to Africa, provoking hopes they might stage a formal photocall.\n\nHarry and Meghan, who arrived in Cape Town 40 minutes late following an overnight flight from London, were photographed smiling broadly as they carried their four-month-old off the plane.\n\nThe Sussexes are due to visit a Cape Town township later today, after settling Archie in at their base, which is believed to be the High Commissioner\u2019s house.\n\nLater in the week, Harry will head off to Malawi via a small propeller plane while Meghan and Archie will stay in Cape Town.\n\nSecurity concerns mean many engagements are not being announced in advance, however the palace has said that Meghan will be passing on some of the many clothes sent to her son by well-wishers. It is believed she will take clothes, books, and pens to the mothers2mothers charity, which assists families with HIV.", "description": "The Sussexes are on their first royal tour as a family.
