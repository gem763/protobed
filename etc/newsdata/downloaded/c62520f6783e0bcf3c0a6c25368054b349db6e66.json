(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen a rider is cited for not paying the fare to board a bus or train in Northern Virginia, the ticket is more likely to be dropped in the courts than paid.\n\nOnly 278 of the 1,306 fare evasion citations handled by the Arlington, Fairfax and Alexandria general district courts between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2019, were paid, according to court records. In those districts, roughly $38,000 in fare evasion fines have gone unpaid in the past two years.\n\nSlightly fewer than half the cases, 619, are listed as past due, some by more than two years. And another 350 were either dropped by the officer who assigned them or dismissed by the court \u2014 oftentimes, Arlington County Chief Judge R. Frances O\u2019Brien said, because officers didn\u2019t show up to court hearings for tickets they wrote.\n\nThe numbers include citations for unpaid fares on Metro and other public transit options like Fairfax Connector. They raise questions about what consequences there are \u2014 and should be \u2014 for not paying to ride at a time when D.C.'s fare evasion cases are mired in bureaucratic confusion, and Metro estimates it loses $36 million annually in unpaid fares across its regional system.\n\nMetro police officers in Virginia give out tickets for fare evasion, a civil offense, ranging from $25 to $250. The court is notified when a new ticket is produced, and a hearing date is set. Offenders are given 30 days to pay the ticket, though they can seek an extension. Money from the fines goes to the local jurisdiction\u2019s general fund \u2014 not to the transit provider.\n\nAccording to a spreadsheet prepared by the Supreme Court of Virginia, a significant proportion of fare evasion tickets from the past two years are going unpaid in the three Virginia courts DC Rider examined. In Arlington, 47% are past due, while 54% in Alexandria and 53% in Fairfax are delinquent. About a fifth of the tickets in Arlington and Alexandria were paid, and a quarter in Fairfax.\n\nMany fare evasion tickets in D.C. also go unpaid. DC Rider reported in June that D.C. and Metro collected less than a fifth of the more than $682,000 the city would have collected between October 2017 and May 2019 had all the issued fare evasion fines been paid.\n\nMetro spokeswoman Sherri Ly said Metro Transit Police Department officers are responsible only for issuing tickets. What happens afterward is up to jurisdictions.\n\nLy didn\u2019t respond to an email when asked why officers drop citations they\u2019ve written. Paul Smedberg, a former Alexandria council member who now serves as Metro board chair, did not return emails in time for publication.\n\nThat so many tickets go unpaid will likely frustrate some riders who do pay their fares and at times turn to Twitter to complain about those getting a free ride. Jurisdictions are grappling with how to treat these cases, given that many who don\u2019t pay are likely poor.\n\nUnlike in Virginia, fare evasion is a criminal offense in Maryland. Meanwhile, the D.C. Council in December overrode Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s veto to pass a bill that removes a potential jail sentence of up to 10 days for fare evasion, leaving a fine of up to $50 as the only punishment.\n\nThe bill\u2019s proponents had said that criminalizing fare evasion disproportionately hurts low-income people and minorities, citing a study that found 91% of those receiving citations for fare evasion in D.C. are African American.\n\nVirginia\u2019s court records do not include the income or race of people who do not pay their fares or fines.\n\nJudge O\u2019Brien declined to speculate about why so many tickets in Virginia go unpaid. Presiding judges for the Fairfax and Alexandria courts were unavailable to comment.\n\nMany people who do not pay fares or fines are likely struggling to pay rent or feed their children, said Amy L. Woolard, an attorney and policy coordinator for the Legal Aid Justice Center, a statewide advocacy group.\n\nTaking strong action against fare evaders, like suspending their driver\u2019s licenses, could \u201chave a snowball effect, and bring serious consequences for minor offenses,\u201d such as losing a job or being unable to drop off children at day care, Woolard said.\n\nVirginia this year softened the driver\u2019s license penalty for failing to pay fare evasion and traffic tickets. The state now has a one-year moratorium on suspending licenses after fines or court fees go unpaid. Critics, including Woolard\u2019s group, had argued the suspensions disproportionately hurt the poor.\n\nBut Makan Shirafkan, a McLean, Va., defense attorney who has handled fare evasion cases, predicted that as a result of the new policy, \u201cwe\u2019re going to start seeing more and more people not paying this stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nShort of suspending licenses, Virginia courts can impose a sentence of up to 60 days in jail, or sentence people to community service for not paying traffic or fare evasion fines, according to the state\u2019s General District Court Manual.\n\nNeither happens very often. Court records for the past-due fines showed no notations for additional jail sentences being handed out. O\u2019Brien said she has never seen anyone sent to jail for not paying a fare evasion fine.\n\nO\u2019Brien said it\u2019s also rare in fare evasion cases for offenders to opt for community service instead of paying fines.\n\nJudges could be reluctant to order jail time or community service, believing that an unpaid fine on a person\u2019s record is punishment enough for not paying a few dollars, Shirafkan said.\n\nOfficials from Metro and the D.C. government have acknowledged that neither institution checks to see if people ever pay their fare evasion fines. Each maintains that it\u2019s the other\u2019s job. Metro spokeswoman Sherri Ly said Friday that the agency still believes that to be the case. LaToya Foster, spokesperson for Bowser, didn\u2019t return emails.\n\nThe case process is different in D.C. Citations there, unlike in Virginia, do not automatically generate a court date. Fare evasion cases only go to D.C. Superior Court when the Attorney General for the District of Columbia decides to prosecute. But in order to do that, the attorney general needs Metro to notify his office of unpaid citations.\n\nWith no one checking to see whether or not the fines are paid, David Mayorga, spokesperson for D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, said the office has no records of cases of unpaid fare evasion fines in 2018.", "description": "According to Virginia court records, only about a fifth of those ticketed for fare evasion have paid their fines.", "authors": ["Kery Murakami", "Express D.C.
