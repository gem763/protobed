(Photo: Andy Marlin, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s close it out in Minnesota,\u2019\u2019 said Yankees slugger Aaron Judge, who is hitting .500 in the series and has reached base seven times in 10 plate appearances.\n\nSimply, the Yankees have turned the Twins into pumpkins this series, subtly reminding everyone that it\u2019s one thing to win 101 games in the AL Central where three of the division teams are tanking.\n\nIt\u2019s quite another to compete with the beasts of the East.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, we really haven\u2019t been looking at the score,\u2019\u2019 Judge said. \u201cOur main focus is to score as many runs as we can. Treat every inning like it\u2019s 0-0. That\u2019s what kind of keeps us in the game and keeps us locked in.\u2019\u2019\n\nStill, who\u2019s fooling who?\n\nThe Twins led the first two innings in Game 1, and haven\u2019t had the lead since, watching their pitching staff crumble in front of the Yankees\u2019 powerful lineup.\n\nThe Yankees have a slash line of .297/.446/.516 in this series, reaching base 37 times, including 16 walks and two hit by pitches.\n\n\u201cWe just have to execute better and we have to go out there and throw better pitches,\u2019\u2019 Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \u201cThere\u2019s no finger pointing. We just have to throw the ball in the strike zone and make and throw good quality starts.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt starts with not being terrified to throw the ball over the plate. They have walked Judge and Giancarlo Stanton seven times in the series. Everyone in the Yankees\u2019 lineup but No. 9 hitter Gio Urshela have walked at least once this series.\n\n\u201cOur big mantra all year,\u2019\u2019 Judge said, \u201chas been control the zone. And that\u2019s what I feel like guys have been doing every single at-bat. No matter who\u2019s up. What the situation is. Guys on base. Nobody on base. When guys cover the zone, guys do damage.\u2019\u2019\n\nLeaving the Twins gasping for breath.\n\n\u201cI think breathing is a big point here,\u2019\u2019 said Twins pitcher Jake Odorizzi, who will start Game 3. \u201cA lot of guys get caught up in the loud noises of Yankee Stadium. As a pitcher, you just have to continue to stay focused. \u2026\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d rather those guys earn their way on base.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Twins, trying anything to break the Yankees\u2019 hex, have already used Cy Young winners, 20-game winners and numerous aces to stop this inglorious streak. This night, they resorted to an Uber driver, 24-year-old rookie Randy Dobnak, who was making only his six start of the season.\n\nHis ride lasted two innings.\n\nThe game ended in the third.\n\nDobnak couldn\u2019t retire a batter in the third inning, and when they summoned their top setup reliever to rescue him, Tyler Duffey brought gasoline to the fire.\n\nThe Yankees scored seven runs in the inning, sending 12 men to the plate, culminating with Didi Gregorius\u2019 grand slam off Duffey, giving the Yankees an 8-0 lead. Judge even carved out a piece of franchise history by becoming the first player to produce multiple hits in a postseason inning.\n\nDidi Gregorius hit the 12th grand slam in Yankees postseason history and the first since Robinson Cano in 2011; no other franchise has more than 7 postseason grand slams.\n\n\n\nHe is also the 4th shortstop with a postseason grand slam and the first Yankees shortstop to do so. pic.twitter.com/mSqMO75cql \u2014 ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) October 5, 2019\n\nYankees ace Masahiro Tanaka, with Judge calling him a \u201ckiller,\u2019\u2019 did the rest, suffocating the Twins\u2019 lineup for five innings, giving up just three hits, with the bullpen cruising the rest of the way.\n\nIt ended with the Twins enduring their biggest rout in a postseason game since Oct. 5, 2003.\n\nThe Yankees will now try to put the Twins out of their misery.\n\nOnce again extinguishing a Twins\u2019 season.\n\n\u201cI know the guys,\u2019\u2019 Boone said. \u201cIt will be throttle down, and hopefully we can go get one.\u2019\u2019\n\nThis time, at least so far, the Twins haven\u2019t even put up any resistance, managing just six hits Saturday night without a homer. They have scored four or fewer runs in their last 12 postseason games, the second-longest streak since 1903.\n\nTheir two starters have lasted a total of six innings, yielding 10 hits and seven runs (five earned), while walking four batters.\n\nTheir top reliever, Duffey, has a 21.60 ERA, yielding six baserunners in 1 2/3 innings, and permitting more inherited runners to score in two nights than he has all season.\n\nMiguel Sano, who hit 34 homers in 105 games during the regular season, has struck out six times.\n\nTheir leadoff hitters have not only failed to reach base, but they have struck out five times without even hitting the ball out of the infield.\n\nAnd their entire pitching staff suddenly lost ability to throw strikes, permitting 18 walks and two hit batters in just 16 innings.\n\nThe Yankees have gone down in order just twice this series, and not a single time Saturday night.\n\nRemarkably, with a team that hit a franchise-record 306 home runs this season, only once have they gone back-to-back innings against the Twins without drawing at least a walk.\n\n\u201cI think it's something that they do take a lot of pride in,\u2019\u2019 Boone says. \u201cI absolutely do think it's contagious. They take that to heart.\n\n\u201cThey have faith and trust in each other and take pride in knowing that when they do that as a group, it benefits all of them because it wears people down.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd when the Twins boarded their plane back to Minneapolis Saturday night, they not only were worn down, but knocked out.\n\nBring on the Astros.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "Didi Gregorius hit a grand slam in the third inning to lead the Yankees rout over the Twins in Game 2 of the ALDS.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
