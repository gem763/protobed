On Thursday, Buttigieg told CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota that he feels sorry for the president, given that he, or someone in his office, would feel compelled to go so far to protect Trump\u2019s ego.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for the president,\u201d Buttigieg said Thursday, reflecting on the matter. \u201cAnd that is not the way we should feel about the most powerful figure in this country, somebody on whose wisdom and judgment our lives literally depend.\u201d\n\n\"I feel sorry for the President,\" Pete Buttigieg says on President Trump appearing to show an altered Hurricane Dorian trajectory map. \u201cIt makes you feel a kind of pity for everybody involved\u201d https://t.co/jB9dijv8yU pic.twitter.com/ENma54ygE9 \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 5, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump presented an outdated, week-old weather map from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that predicted Dorian would likely make landfall on Florida\u2019s east coast. On Trump\u2019s map, someone appears to have used a Sharpie marker to crudely extend Dorian\u2019s \u201ccone of uncertainty\u201d to indicate the hurricane could hit Alabama:\n\nJIM WATSON via Getty Images The map President Donald Trump displayed Wednesday included what appeared to be a Sharpie-drawn extension of the area Hurricane Dorian might hit.\n\nThe alteration appears to be an attempt to defend a statement the president made Sunday, in which he warned via a tweet that Alabama was among the states that would \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a puzzling claim since NOAA models had by Friday begun to indicate Dorian could take a more northerly path. (The National Weather Service corrected Trump\u2019s erroneous prediction Sunday with a tweet of its own.)\n\nInstead of admitting the mistake, the president grew more adamant about his falsehood Thursday morning:\n\nAlabama was going to be hit or grazed, and then Hurricane Dorian took a different path (up along the East Coast). The Fake News knows this very well. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the Fake News! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing there is literally pathetic,\u201d Buttigieg said later. \u201cIt makes you feel a kind of pity for everybody involved. And that\u2019s not how I want to feel about the president, whether it\u2019s from my party \u2015 or another one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is humiliating,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is an embarrassing moment for our country, and we seem to see a new national embarrassment every day.\u201d", "description": "\u201cIt makes you feel a kind of pity for everybody involved,\" the presidential candidate said Thursday.", "authors": ["National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d716de42500007a12055f67.jpeg?cache=lydhbatbkf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
