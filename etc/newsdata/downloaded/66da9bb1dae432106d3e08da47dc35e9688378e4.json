Case in point, a video of scantily clad women dancing at an AIADMK rally in Tamil Nadu has lifted the lid on the practice of using dancers to pull in crowds at rallies.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, himself was campaigning in the area (Nanguneri) when the rally took place. While News Minute was the first to report the incident, and the video of the dancing women has reportedly gone viral, no other news outlet has called out the practice.\n\nThe history of \u2018record dancing\u2019\n\nBy putting a scantily clad woman on a stage, just so that she can be ogled at, is basically objectification 101. That the dancers are reportedly also sexually harassed by members of the crowd, has never been a matter of consideration for the organisers of these events. Their performances are called \u2018record dancing\u2019 and were at one point a popular form of entertainment in rural areas of Tamil Nadu.\n\nThough the AIADMK has found itself in a tough spot after the video went viral, this incident has not led to a bigger conversation about the blatant sexism at play here, and the need to correct this wrong. Perhaps, it is because most parties in the state have resorted to using this unethical formula to gain eyeballs and votes.\n\nWomen\u2019s bodies and the male gaze\n\nThe women who are on stage dancing in scanty costumes, are used just to lure in a male audience. They simply become objects to titillate the men in the audience, and are paid a small sum of money for their performance. While they may indeed be doing it willingly, the political bigwigs who use women's bodies as bait, are the ones who gain power in this transaction.\n\nWe already know that Indian politics is steeped in misogyny, even powerful women are not exempt from regular sexist jibes--be it Priyanka Gandhi, Jayaprada or Mayawati.\n\nTamil Nadu is not the only state where political parties regularly resort to objectification as a tool to lure in crowds at rallies. Former Bigg Boss contestant and dancer Sapna Chaudhary made a name for herself by dancing at rallies in Haryana and Rajasthan. Women are regularly used as sops in corrupt deals, the list is endless. Now that this conversation has started in Tamil Nadu, more voices need to join in and put an end to it.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Tamil Nadu political parties have been using \u2018record dancers\u2019, scantily clad women who dance suggestively to film songs, to pull crowds at rallies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://im.idiva.com/content/2019/Oct/iDiva_Erotic-Dancers-Used-To-Pull-Crowds-To-Rallies-In-TN_Social_5da973ab1b599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
