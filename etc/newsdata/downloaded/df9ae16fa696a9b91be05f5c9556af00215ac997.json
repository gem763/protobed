Where are we?\" Lundqvist said. \"What you want and what the reality is, is sometimes very different. I want to win games. I want to play playoff hockey. And I hope within the group and coaching staff, we talk about it before camp starts. 'OK, this is what we've got?' What's realistic? You set the goal and then you work toward that.\"\n\nThe Rangers will be watched closely as NHL training camps begin this week, a curiosity amid the traditional Eastern Conference powers in Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Pittsburgh. Across the river from New York, the New Jersey Devils look similarly primed to turn things around, but New York seems a threat to contend again after missing the playoffs the past two seasons.\n\n'We should be able to take that next step'\n\n\"It was exciting to see the big steps we're taking in the right direction,\" Lundqvist said. \"We should be able to take that next step now with the additions and the younger guys need to take another step here in their development. But there's so many teams I feel like in similar situations where if they do really well, they can get in.\"\n\nSigning Panarin to a seven-year, $81.5-million US contract is the biggest reason to think the Rangers can get in. Now it's a question of how the Russian point-a-game producer jells with centre Mika Zibanejad and the rest of the forwards within head coach David Quinn's system.\n\nKakko, the second overall pick, dazzled in a prospects tournament and New York's blue-line got a major boost with the trade for Trouba.\n\n\"There's no question that we improved a lot over the summer,\" Lundqvist said. \"Changes, big and small, can turn things around pretty quickly.\"\n\nMcDavid's knee\n\nConnor McDavid is five months removed from tearing the posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, which might now be the most scrutinized body part in the league. The Edmonton captain has surpassed 100 points each of the past three seasons, seems to skate at a different gear than his peers and is widely considered the best hockey player in the world.\n\nThere are plenty of questions about how the injury will affect all that.\n\nThe Oilers say they won\u2019t rush captain Connor McDavid back into action, even though he is five months removed from tearing the posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)\n\n\"It's tough to see anyone get hurt, especially a player of his calibre,\" said Chicago forward Alex DeBrincat, who played junior hockey with McDavid. \"He said it's getting better. Hope he's ready for camp and would love to see him back on the ice.\"\n\nThe Oilers said they won't rush McDavid back. That's a common refrain but easier said than done after missing the playoffs in back-to-back years and knowing what McDavid can do.\n\n\"He's our leader; he's our engine,\" Oilers centre Ryan Nugent-Hopkins said. \"But at the same time, he's a young hockey player who you want to make sure he's healthy and confident in his body. Whenever he's ready to go, we're going to be happy to have him back.\"\n\nNew coaches\n\nSix teams go into camp with a new coach: Joel Quenneville in Florida, Alain Vigneault in Philadelphia, Ralph Krueger in Buffalo, Todd McLellan in Los Angeles, Dallas Eakins in Anaheim and Dave Tippett in Edmonton. All of them have previous NHL experience, most notably Quenneville winning the Stanley Cup three times with Chicago.\n\nNew Panthers head coach Joel Quenneville, who guided the Blackhawks to three Stanley Cup titles, is among six new bench bosses in the NHL this season. (Lynne Sladky/Associated Press)\n\nVigneault took the Vancouver Canucks in 2011 and the Rangers in 2014 to the Cup Final. Now he's in charge of a head-scratching Philadelphia team that has alternated missing and making the playoffs the past eight seasons.\n\n\"He's had success with two different teams,\" Flyers centre Sean Couturier said of Vigneault. \"I think he's a coach that knows what it takes to go far in the playoffs and win.\"\n\nNotable absences\n\nA handful of prominent restricted free agents are signing new contracts on the eve of camp, but a handful of situations might drag on into the regular season. Toronto's Mitch Marner and Winnipeg's Patrik Laine and Kyle Connor don't have deals.\n\n\"Obviously Mitch is a big part of our team,\" Maple Leafs centre Auston Matthews said. \"We want him there and we want him there as soon as possible.\"\n\nMore youth\n\nKakko isn't even the biggest rookie to watch in the New York area, thanks to Devils No. 1 pick Jack Hughes. New Jersey has depth at centre with 2017 top pick Nico Hischer and veteran Travis Zajac that should allow head coach John Hynes to protect Hughes from tough matchups as he adjusts to the NHL.\n\nNew Devils defenceman P.K. Subban says fans soon will see the \"tremendous talent\" of forward Jack Hughes, whom New Jersey drafted first overall this past June. (Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)\n\n\"I think the focus needs to be on his development as a player,\" new Devils defenceman P.K. Subban said. \"He's got a lot of time, and there's going to be a learning curve. But he's a tremendous talent, and you're going to see that when the puck drops.\n\nFiala re-signs with Wild\n\nThe Minnesota Wild have re-signed left wing Kevin Fiala to a two-year, $6 million US contract.\n\nThe deal with the restricted free agent was done on Wednesday, two days before the team's first practice of training camp. Fiala will make $2.5 million this season and $3.5 million in 2020-21, for with an annual salary cap hit of $3 million.\n\nThe 23-year-old Swiss forward was drafted by Nashville with the 11th overall pick in the first round in 2014, was acquired by the Wild in a trade for centre Mikael Granlund at the deadline last season. Fiala totalled 13 goals and 26 assists in 2018-19, in 64 games with the Predators and 19 games with the Wild.", "description": "The New York Rangers, who have missed the playoffs the past two years, will be watched closely as NHL training camps begin this week, a curiosity amid the traditional Eastern Conference powers in Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Pittsburgh.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5280067.1568236701!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/lundqvist-henrik-181112-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
