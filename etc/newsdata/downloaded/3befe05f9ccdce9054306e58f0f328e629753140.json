So I told people I was from India.\n\nIn reality my parents emigrated in 1965 from Kashmir, in northern \u00adPakistan, to the Midlands.\n\n(Image: Ian Vogler / Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Saira Khan)\n\nMy school lessons there \u00adreinforced that Pakistan was a Third World country, where people lived in mud huts, were starving and uneducated.\n\nBut after school, as soon as I walked through the front door, I became a Pakistani.\n\nI changed into my traditional dress called salwar kameez \u2013 the baggy trousers and a tunic Kate has been wearing this week, while meeting orphans and visiting cancer hospitals.\n\nAt home, I ate curry, listened to Pakistani music and spoke Urdu. I was different and different meant an easy target. Not helped by Norman Tebbit with his cricket comments \u2013 support Pakistan and you\u2019re not truly British.\n\nIt was wearing the cultural dress in public that was most traumatic \u2013 so I didn\u2019t do it. But Mum did. She\u2019d pick me up from school in her bright, jewelled, silk floaty fabrics. I was mortified.\n\n(Image: Saira Khan)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nI made sure I was the last one out so I couldn\u2019t hear the yobs calling \u201cwhy have you got your pyjamas on?\u201d or the always original \u201ccan anyone smell curry?\u201d\n\nI wanted my mum to be like my mates\u2019 mums, who wore grey and beige. I wanted to blend in.\n\nFor me, the shame turned to pride when in 2007 I did a BBC documentary, where I travelled thousands of miles to the village my parents came from at the foot of the Himalayas.\n\nLike William and Kate, I visited the iconic Badshahi Mosque in Lahore, where women were welcomed \u2013 something that didn\u2019t happen in the UK.\n\n(Image: Saira Khan)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nI never expected the breathtaking scenery, the diversity of people, the kindness, the fashion and art, the resourcefulness of the young people.\n\nPakistan has been overshadowed by terrorism. But William and Kate brought the real Pakistan into our homes. You can see they\u2019ve fallen in love with the place and its people, just like Diana did. And for once, we are talking about what Kate is wearing and it means something.\n\nEven William has been styling out the traditional hats.\n\nIt\u2019s fashion diplomacy at its best.\n\nAnd the school run in a salwar kameez today seems like a very good idea.", "description": "The big thing for me about their trip \u2013 the first royal visit to the country in 13 years \u2013 is that it has given people in this country pride to be from Pakistan", "authors": ["Saira Khan", "Image", "Ian Vogler", "Daily Mirror", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20648115.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Kate-Middleton-Prince-William.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
