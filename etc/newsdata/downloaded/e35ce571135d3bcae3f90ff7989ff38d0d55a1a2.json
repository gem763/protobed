It's a reason other companies won't attract such eye-popping prices.\n\nRead more: Sex, tequila, and a tiger: Employees inside Adam Neumann's WeWork talk about the nonstop party to attain a $100 billion dream and the messy reality that tanked it\n\nAnd the backlash is already occurring. There's been a full-on investor rebellion against newly public unicorns, such as Peloton, Uber, and Lyft \u2014 each of which has struggled in their early days of trading.\n\nThis can be seen in the chart below, which shows an index of recent IPOs relative to the S&P 500:\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\n\"Paying extraordinary valuations for anything is a bad idea, particularly for businesses that may never generate a positive stream of cash flows,\" he said. \"The most speculative and inappropriately priced areas of the market have begun to break down.\"\n\nWhile that isn't entirely a bad thing, it also means trouble for some of the stocks that have played a big role in the market's run to record highs over the past few years. One such group is enterprise tech, which has already seen stock valuations start to fade. Wilson says that's going to put pressure on the broader market.\n\nHe illustrates those struggles with this chart comparing those tech names to the S&P 500:\n\nMike Wilsons of Morgan Stanley says high growth tech stocks like software and cloud computing companies are falling behind. Bloomberg and Morgan Stanley Research\n\n\"There are still some stocks in the public markets that need to come back to earth and they reside in the secular growth category,\" he said.\n\nThe bad news for WeWork continued Monday as its corporate parent, The We Company, officially ended its bid to go public. It announced that it is withdrawing its IPO filing but said it plans to go pubic later.\n\nThat's just the latest setback for the flexible office space company after questions about its worth, business model, and the leadership and business practices of Neumann. It's been a dramatic fall for a unicorn once valued at $47 billion, but if Wilson is correct, the effects will spread far beyond WeWork.\n\nRead more: How WeWork spiraled from a $47 billion valuation to talk of bankruptcy in just 6 weeks", "description": "Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley says WeWork's struggles share eerie similarities to three other market tops throughout history.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9260742e22af2a842bb343?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
