When the men began to argue and the owner told Parnas he would call the police, Parnas told the man, \u201cIf you call the cops, they are not going to find you ever,\u201d according to a petition for a restraining order filed by the landlord in Miami-Dade county court and obtained by POLITICO.\n\nThree days later, the men met to discuss the matter again. According to the petition, Parnas held a gun to the man\u2019s head and said, \u201cThis is my last warning to you,\u201d then got into his car, a dark blue Porsche Cayenne, and drove off. Three days after that, on Halloween, the police seized from Parnas a .38 revolver, a 9mm pistol, an automatic pistol, and a .40-caliber Glock pistol, according to a court motion filed later by Parnas seeking return of the firearms\u2026\n\nBefore he accompanied Rudy Giuliani to the National Cathedral for George H.W. Bush\u2019s funeral and posted online about dining at the White House with President Donald Trump, Parnas lived a checkered life, often working with fraudsters and others tied to organized crime. As Parnas and one of his alleged co-conspirators head to arraignment next Wednesday on charges of manipulating the American political system at the behest of foreigners, the ease with which he was able to buy his way into Trump\u2019s inner circle provides an alarming indicator of the integrity of that system.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
