It does not use the word \u201cwall,\u201d but the White House will likely highlight the construction as part of the president\u2019s effort to keep his signature campaign promise.\n\nEsper\u2019s letter describes the location of over 140 miles of new fencing on the border, some of which replaces older barriers. The letter describes both \u201cprimary pedestrian fencing\u201d\u2014fencing right along the border designed to keep people from walking across it\u2014and \u201csecondary fencing\u201d\u2014fencing that is typically farther inland and designed to act as a reinforcement. (Those definitions are according to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which closely tracks border security and pushes for much stricter enforcement of immigration laws.)\n\n\u201cThese projects will deter illegal entry, increase the vanishing time of those illegally crossing the border, and channel migrants to ports of entry,\u201d wrote Defense Sec. Mark Esper in his letter. \u201cThey will reduce the demand for DoD personnel and assets at the locations where the barriers are constructed and allow the redeployment of DoD personnel and assets to other high-traffic areas on the border without barriers. In short, these barriers will allow DoD to provide support to DHS more efficiently and effectively. In this respect, the contemplated construction projects are force multipliers.\u201d\n\nThe largest chunk of new primary pedestrian fencing is planned to run from a point of entry in Laredo, Texas along the Rio Grande for 52 miles, according to the letter. It will cost almost $1.3 billion.\n\nThe letter also details plans for more than 30 miles of new pedestrian fencing in Arizona, replacing vehicle barriers and costing $527 million. It also covers plans to replace more than 23 miles of vehicle barriers in New Mexico with new pedestrian fencing. That project will cost $476 million, according to the letter.\n\nA Pentagon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCritics say the Trump administration\u2019s plan to redirect funding allocated for military construction projects to border fencing breaks the law. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has called it an \u201cillegal money grab.\u201d Meanwhile, the president\u2019s critics on the right say his administration is overstating his progress on border security, given that it reportedly hasn\u2019t built any new barriers where none previously existed.", "description": "The Defense Department is redirecting billions of taxpayer dollars to help fulfill a presidential goal.
