At just 18-years-old, the way in which he took his goals showed the maturity of a natural goalscorer beyond his years.\n\nHis first goal was taken expertly as he flicked his diving header across Miliinkovic-Savic and into the far corner after great movement. As for his second, he showed great spatial awareness in the box, hesitating to buy an extra yard before whipping his shot into the far corner yet again. The movement and execution for his assist to Dani Ceballos was equally special.\n\nShowing that he\u2019s good enough to produce at this level, he could make the Europa League his own this year.\n\n2: Kieran Tierney is ready for the Premier League\n\nLike Martinelli, Kieran Tierney hit the ground running after his impressive debut. Not afraid to take his man on, the Scot showed intent from the off and was rewarded within minutes. His inch-perfect cross was nodded home by Martinelli on 13 minutes but he wasn\u2019t finished there. He continued to bomb down the left flank and was a handful for Standard Liege.\n\nArsenal\u2019s next Premier League game may to be too early for Tierney as it comes on Sunday but has shown what he is about. Taking his man on, delivering pinpoint crosses and calm defending. Sead Kolasinac has been a decent outlet down the left for Arsenal but Tierney looks much more assured on both sides of the ball and could help Arsenal kick on another gear.\n\n3: Maitland-Niles still recovering\n\nThe past few weeks have been tough for Maitland-Niles, but he hasn\u2019t found his form just yet. Playing further upfield, the 22-year-old didn\u2019t look as confident as some of his teammates which had an effect on some Arsenal attacks.\n\nOn occasion he would stumble over or miss-control the ball. Still a young player, this will not be the making of his career but it will be important that he learns from this indifferent spell in his career.\n\n4: Back On Top\n\nIn his third appearance of the season, Shkodran Mustafi kept his third clean sheet. Even though he was troubled too often, the German held his ground well when needed. With Arsenal\u2019s defence under scrutiny in the Premier League, the centre back may be wondering what more he has to do to get into Unai Emery\u2019s main squad but like fellow countryman Mesut Ozil who also doesn\u2019t look to be in the Spaniard\u2019s plans.\n\n5: Europa League fails to satisfy Emirates faithful\n\nAs has been the case for Arsenal\u2019s two previous seasons in the Europa League, Emirates Stadium struggles to fill. Although the club listed the game as sold out, pockets of seats were visible across the ground.\n\nThe Europa League, of course, isn\u2019t a competition Arsenal want to be in, but with a chance to see a performance like Martinelli\u2019s tonight, maybe these are games fans should be heading to.", "description": "Gabriel Martinelli\u00a0shone, scoring twice as Arsenal\u00a0swept aside Standard Liege 4-0 at Emirates Stadium on Thursday night.
