Mr Trump later said he ended the summit because North Korea demanded that all sanctions be lifted. Pyongyang\u2019s representative later denied that claim and said it only requested the partial lifting of five UN sanctions.\n\nWith one eye on next year\u2019s presidential election and keen to secure diplomatic breakthrough, some analysts believe Mr Trump may be willing to be more flexible on the previous policy of the \u201ccomplete, verifiable and irreversible\u201d elimination of the North\u2019s nuclear capabilities.\n\n\u201cMr Trump wants to say that he has reached a deal with the North, to claim that he has succeeded where all other presidents have failed and to say that he is better than all his predecessors\u201d, Mr Dujarric said. \u201cThis president seems to have no red lines that he is not willing to sacrifice\u201d.", "description": "The United States has promised to lift some \u201clow-level\u201d sanctions imposed on North Korea when the two nations\u2019 negotiators meet in Stockholm for the first time since talks broke down, with a resumption of tours to the North\u2019s Mount Kumgang resort area one possible concession.\u00a0 Diplomatic sources said", "authors": ["Julian Ryall"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YWvVAr9AG2qcfIHSjnNVaw--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/d792f8eb9d849da46014056c0f970cfb", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
