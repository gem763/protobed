The New York Times now says Hillary Clinton said Republicans, not Russians, were grooming Tulsi Gabbard?", "language": "en", "text": "Remember when 2020 Democratic candidate Tulsi Gabbard went on an \u201cunhinged\u201d \u201coutrageous tweet storm\u201d after Hillary Clinton suggested in a podcast that Gabbard was being groomed by the Russians for a third-party run to split the Democratic vote? Well now Hillary Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill is claiming that the New York Times got it wrong, and Clinton had actually said Republicans, not Russians, were grooming her as a third-party candidate.\n\nThat\u2019s kind of a big mistake.\n\nOn Friday, the NYT did a piece about a podcast Secretary Clinton did with David Plouffe. They incorrectly quoted her saying that the \u201cRussians\u201d were \u201cgrooming\u201d a candidate running in the Democratic primary. They rightfully fixed it to reflect that she was taking about the GOP. pic.twitter.com/iFCphQhZcU \u2014 Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) October 22, 2019\n\nIn yesterday\u2019s paper, @superwuster wrote an opinion piece accusing Secretary Clinton of trading in conspiracy theories, based off of comments that she didn\u2019t make. pic.twitter.com/TXCXTk6fjk \u2014 Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) October 22, 2019\n\nMerrill\u2019s thread goes on a bit, but we\u2019re most concerned with the New York Times\u2019 conflation of Russian and Republican.\n\nThere is no correction appended to the story online? (I am not arguing with you, I can see in the Wayback Machine that it was changed between 18 Oct and 19 Oct.) Has the NYT acknowledged the change? \u2014 Maryn McKenna (@marynmck) October 22, 2019\n\nThey already got out the message they wanted. No one who believed it will know of the change. \u2014 Adzter (@Adzter1996) October 22, 2019\n\n\u2026so in the end, what can be derived from this entire debacle is @nytimes serves nothing-burgers. \u2014 \u2026melanintary, my dear. (@dlnodots) October 22, 2019\n\nUhhhhhhhhhh that\u2019s one hell of an edit \u2014 d_mcc (@d_mccarthy37) October 23, 2019\n\nWhat about your \u201cif the nesting doll fits\u201d quote? P.s. get a blue check mark please \u2014 Tom Matzzie (@tommatzzie) October 22, 2019\n\nthat confirmed Gabbard was referenced, not that Russians were her groomers \ud83d\udcaf \u2014 SH (@sweethegemony) October 22, 2019\n\nHow? Nesting dolls are Russian, right? \u2014 Mark\ud83e\udde2 (@Makotano7x) October 22, 2019\n\nYeah, what about that \u201cIf the nesting doll fits\u201d comment?\n\nHillary Clinton appears to suggest Russians are 'grooming' Tulsi Gabbard for third-party run. Clinton spox @NickMerrill, when asked if HRC was referring to Gabbard: \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d More here: https://t.co/MfnW3HAmCI \u2014 Dan Merica (@merica) October 18, 2019\n\nHillary had time to tweet that gif at Booker and that boomer-ass JFK meme but not to correct this misquote that everyone was talking about? \u2014 Armagordon (@dertwerst) October 22, 2019\n\nGood point.\n\nOMFG. The NYT got the details wrong and everyone freaked out over something approaching a transcription error? https://t.co/kQ6QDeLQBj \u2014 Bill Fitzgerald (@funnymonkey) October 23, 2019\n\nI wonder if Bernie and others are going to issue new statements now. I'm guessing not. https://t.co/TOvY0ZqCoA \u2014 Dan (@DKinMN) October 23, 2019\n\nIs this real life? Who is running the @nytimes and why have they not lost their jobs yet? https://t.co/45a8fDO2Ab \u2014 \ud835\ude7c\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude94\ud835\ude8e \ud835\ude71\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude8d (@miketheidealist) October 23, 2019\n\nWow, that entire controversy about Hillary criticizing Tulsi Gabbard was a lie based on shoddy reporting by the NYT. Hillary never said what they claimed she said. Unbelievable. https://t.co/AUbJpIS2rh \u2014 John Scare-avosis\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aravosis) October 22, 2019\n\nAnother bang-up job by the NYT. https://t.co/NHGFcNBeu6 \u2014 Dean Barker (@deanbarker) October 22, 2019\n\nHmm \u2026\n\nClinton spox and Harvey Weinstein toady Nick Merrill tries to dig Hillary out of a hole after smearing Tulsi Reminder that after Clinton's comment's he had no problem relishing and giving further comment to journos https://t.co/eHFnX0RdD2 \u2014 Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) October 22, 2019\n\nTrue: He told CNN, \u201cThis is not some outlandish claim. This is reality. If the Russian propaganda machine, both their state media and their bot and troll operations, is backing a candidate aligned with their interests, that is just a reality, it is not speculation.\u201d\n\nSo\u2026 there\u2019s audio. And you with the whole \u2018nesting doll\u2019 thing. And HRC on The View. You\u2019re so used to lying but this is DAYS ago!! \u2014 louisejohnston\ud83c\udf3a (@louise_anne67) October 22, 2019", "description": "Hillary Clinton's spokesperson sure didn't hesitate to mention the Russians in comments after the fact.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hillarycough.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
