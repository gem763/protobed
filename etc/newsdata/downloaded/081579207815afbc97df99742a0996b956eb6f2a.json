He usually passes the bar he's credited for naming (This Ain't Hollywood), strolls by the vacant building where Frank Zappa once bought magazines, and eventually stops at the top of Jackson Square \u2014 where he looks across the street into the window of what used to be Star Records.\n\nHamilton and its music culture have undergone quite a few changes since Houston, now 58, was a teenage punk rocker in the band Forgotten Rebels. But his mind is still full of memories of the the city's thriving punk scene, which served as an incubator for bands like Teenage Head, Simply Saucer and Forgotten Rebels.\n\nHouston still considers the strolls down memory lane as his \"secret world\" of punk music \u2014 a mind-map of the good old days, when the local record store reigned supreme and the internet was nonexistent. This Thanksgiving weekend, Houston gave walking tours of his secret world to the public.\n\nHouston addresses the crowd in front of the building where he wrote the hit 1982 Forgotten Rebels song, Surfin' on Heroin. (Justin Mowat/CBC)\n\nTwo tours took place on Saturday and Sunday, with Houston leading groups of 20 to 30 enthusiasts and musicians to some of the city's most notorious punk landmarks. A few of his musician pals from back in the day joined along the way to provide extra stories and commentary.\n\nTara Bursey, program director at the Workers Art and Heritage Centre, helped organize and put on the event with Sid Drmay and Craig Caron, under the moniker Punk City. Local artist and bookstore owner Dave Kuruc, who Houston referred to as \"the encyclopedia of Hamilton,\" designed a limited edition annotated map to accompany the tour.\n\nRecord store beginnings\n\nBursey has lived in Hamilton for about seven years now, but she's been a fan of bands like Teenage Head and Forgotten Rebels since she was a youngster. After moving to the city, it wasn't long until Bursey ran into Houston at one of the local record stores. That's when she had the idea for the tour.\n\nShe thought it would benefit younger punk musicians \u2014 who Bursey says are having trouble finding space to congregate and play nowadays \u2014 to hear from a much-respected and experienced veteran of the Hamilton scene.\n\nWearing tinted shades and a vintage leather jacket, Houston first led the crowd of mixed ages to the outdoor second floor of Jackson Square, looking over King Street and James Street.\n\nStar Records \u2014 the place where it all started for Houston \u2014 used to be in the building just across the street. He pointed to one window in particular of the now-abandoned floor, and explained it was the exact spot where he first heard a Teenage Head demo tape.\n\nBand t-shirts were a common sight among attendees, including this Teenage Head shirt. (Justin Mowat/CBC)\n\n\"It was total anarchy in there, where records that would never even be stocked in certain stores, were on the front rack [at Star Records],\" Houston said.\n\nThe emergence of punk in the '70s was especially prevalent in Hamilton. It was a town with a lot of \"misfits\" and \"outsiders,\" he said, and when punk arrived, it gave those people a home in the form of a cathartic outlet. It felt like a secret world to Houston because \u2014 at the time \u2014 Hamilton was the only thriving punk scene he and his friends were aware of.\n\nWhy so serious?\n\nThe prominence of the genre in the city boiled down to a hard working blue-collar culture and a teenage scepticism of not taking anything too seriously, Houston said. Forgotten Rebels lead singer Micky de Sadist would come up with most of the band's song ideas when he worked at the Otis Elevator factory.\n\n\"A lot of those songs are influenced by him sitting around a lunchroom with his colleagues at work, and their perceptions on life,\" he said. \"Hamilton was a working class city and you're not going to make good music unless you really represent the environment you're living in.\"\n\nThe group followed Houston through the streets of Hamilton to see where punk musicians used to live, play and rehearse. (Justin Mowat/CBC)\n\nHouston also stressed the importance of maintaining a sense of humour when creating punk music as teenagers.\n\n\"When you're a kid, you're always going to see the contradictions of people and power ... and you kinda play with that.\"\n\nSometimes that attitude got the band in patches of trouble, specifically once with Canadian politician and former prime minister Pierre Trudeau.\n\nTurn it up to 11\n\nThen-band manager of Forgotten Rebels, Steve Berman, had a useful family connection for the band to take advantage of to play a high profile show. Berman's father was campaign manager at the time for John Munro, Liberal Member of Parliament for Hamilton East.\n\n\"They wanted to get the youth out,\" Houston said, and so the Rebels were invited to play at a campaign event for Trudeau's 1980 reelection.\n\nHouston speaks to the crowd of punk enthusiasts on one of the many stops of the tour. (Justin Mowat/CBC)\n\nHouston couldn't attend the show because his parents dragged him to the family cottage, but he managed to catch some of the event on CBC Television.\n\n\"They had the reporter talking about Trudeau's campaign event and all I could hear was Micky's guitar in the background,\" he said. \"And then during Trudeau's speech, Micky kept turning on his ear-splitting amplifier and making feedback sounds.\n\n\"It's juvenile stuff, but it takes the piss out of all the serious stuff.\"\n\nHouston still records music daily and his new album, which he's been working on for the past two years with top-tier musicians, will be available in the coming weeks.", "description": "Hamilton and its music culture have undergone quite a few changes since Houston, now 58, was a teenage punk rocker in the band Forgotten Rebels.
