This is enough to induce intoxication but without psychotic symptoms, they say.\n\n\u201cOur findings add to a growing body of evidence that suggests the health effects of cannabis are dose-related,\u201d said lead author Sam Craft, from King\u2019s College London. \u201cWe believe a unit system would help both users and healthcare professionals by providing clearer information on the types of cannabis products and their strength.\u201d\n\nPrevious research from the team has highlighted how concentrations of THC in cannabis have doubled across Europe in the past decade. But although use of the drug is widespread and there are moves in some countries to legalise it, standard units \u2013 which have been commonplace for alcohol for many years \u2013 have not been adopted in health guidelines.\n\nThe authors believe that a standard unit system would also yield benefits for countries where cannabis use is illegal, such as the UK. \u201cWhere the unit system for alcohol has helped consumers to better manage their alcohol intake, so, too, this could have important implications for cannabis users,\u201d said senior author Dr Tom Freeman from the University of Bath. \u201cThis should give clear guidance about the dose of THC people are consuming. Our hope is that the introduction of a system in locations where the drug is legalised will have knock-on effects to countries where it is not, providing users and clinicians with an important toolkit to guide safer use.\u201d\n\nThe publication coincides with a second study from the team, published in the journal Psychological Medicine, which examines the relationship between cannabis and key health outcomes in more than 55,000 people across 175 countries.\n\nUsing the Global Drug Survey, consumers were asked about the types of cannabis they used and their health. The results showed those who used higher THC forms of cannabis, such as hashish, experienced more severe health problems than those using traditional herbal products with lower levels of THC.", "description": "Addiction experts say standard units, similar to those used for alcohol, would help consumers know the level of drug they are taking and its effects", "authors": ["Jamie Doward"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f19d940123c4a50b41d45051b46d7d3a768f5d04/0_19_1800_1079/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=75787a07c802b04c491c729bea6444c5", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
