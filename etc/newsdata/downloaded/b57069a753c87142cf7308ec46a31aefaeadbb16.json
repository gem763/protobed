Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) attacked President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to withdraw remaining U.S. troops from Syria, tweeting Tuesday that a pullout could have \u201ccatastrophic consequences.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s sudden withdrawal from northern Syria & endorsement of Turkey\u2019s actions could have catastrophic consequences & risks laying the ground for immense violence and suffering. We can pursue a strategy to stop our endless wars without endangering the lives of innocent people. https://t.co/N2YWjEGveX \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 8, 2019\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s stance is a complete reversal of her earlier position on the war in Syria and other \u201cendless wars\u201d overseas.\n\nShe ran in 2018 on a pledge to end the war in Syria and elsewhere: \u201cAlexandria believes that we must end the \u201cforever war\u201d by bringing our troops home, and ending the air strikes that perpetuate the cycle of terrorism throughout the world,\u201d her 2018 campaign website said:\n\nSince the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the United States has entangled itself in war and occupation throughout the Middle East and North Africa. As of 2018, we are currently involved in military action in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia. Hundreds of thousands of civilians in these countries have been killed either as collateral damage from American strikes or from the instability caused by U.S. interventions. Millions more have fled their broken countries, contributing to the global refugee crisis.\n\n\u2026 According to the Constitution, the right to declare war belongs to the legislative body, and yet many of these global acts of aggression have never once been voted on by Congress. In some cases, we\u2019ve even acted unilaterally, without the backing of the United Nations. America should not be in the business of destabilizing countries. While we may see ourselves as liberators, the world increasingly views us as occupiers and aggressors. Alexandria believes that we must end the \u201cforever war\u201d by bringing our troops home, and ending the air strikes that perpetuate the cycle of terrorism throughout the world. By bringing our troops home, we can begin to heal the wounds we\u2019re opening by continuing military engagement. We can begin to repair our image. We can reunite military families, separated by repeated deployments. We can become stronger by building stronger diplomatic and economic ties, and by saving our armed forces only for when they\u2019re truly needed.\n\nIn addition, Ocasio-Cortez has repeatedly used her widely-followed Twitter account to attack U.S. wars in Syria and elsewhere:\n\nPrevious gens have used millennials like a credit card: leaving nonstop war, an eroding planet, and education profiteering to fix ourselves. Now it\u2019s on us. The same officials who got us into this mess aren\u2019t going to get us out. It\u2019s time to elect a new generation to office. https://t.co/jFthsbFdix \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 9, 2018\n\nThe blueprint for war and regime change is right here. This is dangerous. Bolton championed wars costing thousands of lost lives \u2013 both in American soldiers and innocent people abroad. The US must transition to humanitarian, diplomacy-led, peace-driven foreign policy. https://t.co/q44f4Nvk6U \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 24, 2018\n\nCongress MUST repeal the AUMF. It is incredibly destabilizing legislation that erodes our government\u2019s system of checks and balances, and a persistent threat to peace worldwide. War doesn\u2019t bring peace. Alleviating poverty does. Education does. Representative gov does. /2 \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 14, 2018\n\nHere is the profound danger of what we just did in Syria: A \u2018mad king\u2019 President, with majority disapproval of Americans, just decided to bomb a nation without the Constitutional requirement of Congressional approval. Democrats who take war money passed the laws allowing that. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 14, 2018\n\nSure looks like powerful people are trying to bribe the President into war. https://t.co/e4L4YcrGKp \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 7, 2019\n\nPaul Ryan\u2019s project to \u201cbalance the budget\u201d was always a ruse to explode the deficit with corporate tax cuts + endless war. Ryan continues his abdication of economic + moral responsibility with his war in Yemen, curtailing of Congressional power, & imperiling countless children. https://t.co/kXDoK2e6DQ \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) December 12, 2018\n\nI remember a time when it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d to question the Iraq War. All of Congress was wrong, including both GOP & Dem Party, and led my generation into a disastrous + wrong war that virtually all would come to regret, except for the one member who stood up: Barbara Lee. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 5, 2019\n\n\u2018@tedlieu repeatedly asked [Sec. Pompeo\u2019s advisor] if the Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war. He would not say \"yes.\" Lieu submitted the Constitution for the record.\u2019 \ud83d\ude02 https://t.co/VTd5ZElG8E \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 19, 2019\n\nThis administration needs to put down its saber and pick up a phone. Diplomacy is what grants us peace and stability \u2013 not war. #NoWarOnIran https://t.co/NZtifF3eki \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 21, 2019\n\nCommon ground I find with (some) GOP: \u2013 Ending needless war & curbing exploding military spending\n\n\u2013 Protecting civil liberties & privacy rights (I believe people shouldn\u2019t be spied on by gov or corporations, incl your phone & habits)\n\n\u2013 Holding bad contractors accountable https://t.co/PSde2DWGn4 \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 3, 2019\n\nOcasio-Cortez did not provide an alternative solution for Syria, or for Kurdish security, or relations with Turkey.\n\nJoel B.
