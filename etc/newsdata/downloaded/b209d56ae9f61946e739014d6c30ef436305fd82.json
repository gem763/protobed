Immediately, you feel like pressing the panic button. You had been dreading this very moment. So, you start bombarding your child with a barrage of questions. Or you may start scolding him or her.

It's just a silly infatuation that's going to wear off with time. Just smile at her innocence and lend her a patient hearing. Get the scoop out of her. Encourage her to share with you everything - for instance, did she kiss him?Try to remember how your parents handled you telling them about your first crush. If they were harsh with you, do not follow in their footsteps. Do not silence your child or try to tell him or her that having feelings for a classmate or a friend is a bad thing.Tell your child that while feeling drawn to a friend is a great thing, there are certain rules to follow. If the feeling is mutual, they should focus on nurturing their friendship. They can meet and play together; they can hold hands, but they shouldn't kiss. And they should tell you everything they are doing together. Those are the boundaries you want them to respect.Ask your child if the friend he or she is crushing on is reciprocating his or her feelings as well. If it's a one-way traffic, tell your child that he or she should respect the other person's feelings and move on. In this case, be ready to help your child deal with his or her first rejection or heartbreak as well.", "description": "Your child has just told you about his or her first crush. How do you react?
