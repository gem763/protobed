But, few know what these names actually mean.\n\nA name is one of the most important ways a company can set a first impression for a customer. These names need to be catchy, memorable, and uncomplicated to make sure they stick.\n\nWe put together a list of popular brands and investigated where their names originated. Some of them have crazy backstories.\n\nThe list includes big names such as Amazon, Nike, Adidas, and Pepsi.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nYou\u2019re wearing your favorite Nike sneakers and Lululemon pants when you head to the mall to do some shopping at the Gap. On your way there, you grab a latt\u00e9 at Starbucks.\n\nAfter a few good hours of shopping, you head to Panera to meet a friend for lunch. You Venmo her for the meal and then you both decide dessert is in the cards: Next stop, H\u00e4agen-Dazs.\n\nAll of these popular brands are staples in our lives, and most of us will come into contact with at least one of them every day. However, few of us actually know what they mean.\n\nThe name of a company is one of the most important ways to set a good first impression for the customer. It needs to be catchy, memorable, and uncomplicated, which often means companies keep them short and snappy.\n\nIn some cases, companies will even invent what seems like an entirely new language around their brand name. Think Google, Venmo, and Twitter, for example. For some, there might be a crazy backstory behind the origins of their name.\n\nFor this reason, we decided to put together a list of 26 well-known brands and find out how their founders came up with their often-kooky names.\n\nFind out more below:\n\nPepsi was named after the medical term for indigestion.\n\nsource Pepsi\n\nThe inventor of Pepsi, Caleb Davis Bradham, originally wanted to be a doctor, but a family crisis meant that he left medical school and became a pharmacist instead, according to the company website.\n\nHis original invention, known as \u201cBrad\u2019s Drink,\u201d was made from a mix of sugar, water, caramel, lemon oil, and nutmeg. Three years later, Bradham renamed his drink, which he believed aided digestion, to \u201cPepsi-Cola,\u201d taken from the word \u201cdyspepsia,\u201d meaning indigestion.\n\nPanera is a portmanteau of the words \u201cpan\u201d and \u201cera.\u201d\n\nAccording to Panera\u2019s Facebook page, the sandwich chain\u2019s name \u201chas Latin and Spanish roots.\u201d\n\nIn Spanish, \u201cpan\u201d means bread and \u201cera\u201d means age or time. So put together, Panera means \u201cage of bread.\u201d\n\nRon Shaich, the founder of Panera, also told Fortune the name comes from the Latin word for breadbasket.\n\nGoogle owes its name to a typo.\n\nsource Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nGoogle\u2019s name emerged from a brainstorming session at Stanford University. Founder Larry Page was coming up with ideas for a massive data-index website with other graduate students, Business Insider reported.\n\nOne of the suggestions was \u201cgoogolplex\u201d one of the largest describable numbers. The name \u201cGoogle\u201d came about after one of the students accidentally spelled it wrong. Page then registered his company with this name.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is named after two brothers who ran a burger restaurant.\n\nsource Getty Images\n\nRaymond Kroc, the founder of McDonald\u2019s, was a milkshake machine salesman when he first met brothers Dick and Mac McDonald, who ran a burger restaurant in San Bernardino, California.\n\nThe McDonald brothers bought several of his Kroc\u2019s Multimixers and he was so impressed by their burger restaurant that he became their agent and set up franchises around the US, Money reported.

The name combines his nickname, Adi, and the first three letters of his last name.\n\nJ.Crew\u2019s name set it up to compete with Ralph Lauren\u2019s Polo line.\n\nAccording to Forbes, \u201cThe name Crew was picked to compete with Ralph Lauren\u2019s Polo label and [founder Arthur] Cinader added the J because he thought it added [cachet].\u201d\n\nMakes sense. Polo and crew are both pretty preppy sports.\n\n\u201cA genie whispered \u2018Rolex,'\u201d in the founder\u2019s ear.\n\nsource Vesper & Co.\n\nHans Wilsdorf, the founder of Rolex, wanted a brand name that could be said in any language, Business Insider reported.\n\n\u201cI tried combining the letters of the alphabet in every possible way,\u201d said Wilsdorf, according to Rolex. \u201cThis gave me some hundred names, but none of them felt quite right. One morning, while riding on the upper deck of a horse-drawn omnibus along Cheapside in the City of London, a genie whispered \u2018Rolex\u2019 in my ear.\u201d\n\nLululemon means nothing at all. And it\u2019s intentionally hard to pronounce.\n\nsource Brenan McDermid / REUTERS\n\nLululemon founder Chip Wilson came up with the yoga-wear brand\u2019s name because he thought Japanese people wouldn\u2019t be able to pronounce it.\n\nHe wrote in 2009:\n\n\u201cIt was thought that a Japanese marketing firm would not try to create a North American sounding brand with the letter \u2018L\u2019 because the sound does not exist in Japanese phonetics. By including an \u2018L\u2019 in the name it was thought the Japanese consumer would find the name innately North American and authentic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn essence, the name \u2018lululemon\u2019 has no roots and means nothing other than it has 3 \u2018L\u2019s\u2019 in it. Nothing more and nothing less.\u201d\n\nA representative for Lululemon told Business Insider that the brand\u2019s name was chosen from a list of 20 brand names and 20 logos by a group of 100 people.\n\nZara came from Zorba, its original name.\n\nsource REUTERS/Albert Gea\n\nZara founder Amancio Ortega originally named his company after the 1964 film \u201cZorba the Greek.\u201d But this didn\u2019t last long.\n\nThe first store, which opened in La Coru\u00f1a in 1975, happened to be two blocks down from a bar called Zorba, The New York Times reported. Ortega had already made the mold for the letters of his sign when the bar owner told him that it was too confusing for them to have the same name.\n\nIn the end, Ortega ended up rearranging the letters to make the closest word he could come up with \u2013 hence Zara, according to The New York Times.\n\nASOS is an abbreviation of AsSeenOnScreen.\n\nsource Thomson Reuters\n\nThe British online retailer was founded as AsSeenOnScreen in 1999 and lived at asseenonscreen.com.

The name referred to the generation gap between adults and kids.\n\nWawa is named after an area of Pennsylvania.\n\nsource Wawa\n\nThe convenience-store chain\u2019s name means two things: 1. It\u2019s the name of the area in Pennsylvania where the company\u2019s first dairy farm was located. 2. It\u2019s a Native-American word for a Canada Goose (the one pictured in the company\u2019s logo).\n\nH\u00e4agen-Dazs may sound Danish, but it\u2019s completely made up.\n\nReuben Mattus, a Jewish immigrant from Poland, named his ice-cream company H\u00e4agen-Dazs as a way to pay tribute to Denmark, according to an interview with the Jewish news publication Tablet Magazine. But the name doesn\u2019t actually mean anything.\n\n\u201cThe only country which saved the Jews during World War II was Denmark, so I put together a totally fictitious Danish name and had it registered,\u201d Mattus said. \u201cH\u00e4agen-Dazs doesn\u2019t mean anything. [But] it would attract attention, especially with the umlaut.\u201d\n\nNike is the Greek goddess of victory.\n\nsource Thomson Reuters\n\nNike was founded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports, and it didn\u2019t take on its current name until 1971.\n\nCo-founders Bill Bowerman -a track-and-field coach \u2013 and Phil Knight, a middle-distance runner from Portland, had wanted to make the name \u201cDimension 6\u201d originally.

Plank said he had landed on the name Body Armor, but couldn\u2019t get the name trademarked. He told The Post:\n\n\u201cI was a bit dejected, but I had lunch plans that afternoon with my oldest brother, Bill. So, I show up to pick him up, knock on the door, and he looks down at me the way only an older brother can look at a younger brother, and he asks, \u201cHow\u2019s that company you\u2019re working on, uhh \u2026 Under Armor?\u201d\n\nSo how did Under Armour end up with that weird spelling?\n\n\u201cThe reason we added the \u2018U\u2019 in \u2018Armour\u2019 is that I was skeptical at the time about whether this whole internet thing would stick,\u201d Plank told The Post. \u201cSo I thought the phone number 888-4ARMOUR was much more compelling than 888-44ARMOR. I wish there was a little more science or an entire marketing study behind it, but it was that simple.\u201d\n\nAmazon was named after the world\u2019s biggest river.\n\nsource Amazon\n\nWhen Amazon first launched in 1995, founder Jeff Bezos had a different idea for his brand name.\n\nBezos wanted to call his online bookstore Cadabra, according to Brad Stone\u2019s book about the company.
