He didn't kill himself, he was too vain.'\n\nKerry touched upon the domestic violence she claims to have suffered while she was with George.\n\n'When I got a good hiding, I'd apologise to him': Kerry spoke about being groomed by George throughout their relationship\n\nShe said: 'George had very many issues. By the time I\u2019d worked all these issues out, I was already madly in love with him, we had a baby on the way.\n\n'We've known each other since we were 14. I always fancied him. He always fancied me - and when the violence started it\u2019s like you're being groomed. Everyone tells you to walk away but you can't.\n\n'When I got a good hiding, I'd apologise to him.'\n\n'I feel guilty that DJ didn't get to see her dad for a year, I really do. I'm not slagging him off, I would hand DJ over and I'd fear I wouldn't get her back.\n\nChildren: Kerry is a doting mother to five - she has two daughters with ex Westlife partner Brian McFadden Molly, 16, and Lilly-Sue, 14. She also shares Heidi, 10, and Maxwell, nine, with second husband Mark Croft (pictured in May 2017)\n\n'He would spit in my face, and then DJ started to spit in my face.\n\nKerry added: 'I know if I\u2019d stayed with George I\u2019d be dead. I know it 100%. Or DJ would. I\u2019m going to stand by that until the day I die. It was never going to happen [him change his life].'\n\nKerry said she had to end things with George for the sake of her children.\n\nShe said: 'Any decent mother, you would not allow your child to be around somebody who was abusing drugs.\n\nKerry said she had to end things with George for the sake of her children. She said: 'Any decent mother, you would not allow your child to be around somebody who was abusing drugs'\n\n'When I was in my dark days doing drugs, if I didn\u2019t sort myself out, I wouldn\u2019t have my children and I wouldn\u2019t blame anyone for taking my children off me. I wanted to help him.'\n\nShe said the moment she realised she had to leave was at her friend's dad's funeral.\n\nShe said: 'George was with me and I just thought how do I want my life to end. I had this fear, it\u2019ll be my funeral next.'\n\n'I remember going up to Danielle [Brown] and I said I didn't love George anymore.

I know it 100%. Or DJ would. I\u2019m going to stand by that until the day I die'\n\n'Molly looked at me like I was a weak person and I decided I never wanted to look at me like that again.'\n\nDespite being estranged, Kerry and George were still married at the time of his death.\n\nShe said: 'I went to the chapel rest and I drove straight down because we were still married. I was so angry that he left his baby girl, because she's beautiful.\n\nKerry continued: \u201cI\u2019m so angry. He gave me hell when he was alive, and then he just left me, not left me, he left this world. I\u2019m not going to lie, he\u2019s better off where he is.\n\n'He was so unhappy on this earth. He had so many demons, so many issues, we thought when DJ was born he\u2019d change his ways, he had chance after chance.\n\nKerry said: 'I\u2019m so angry. He gave me hell when he was alive, and then he just left me, not left me, he left this world. I\u2019m not going to lie, he\u2019s better off where he is'\n\n'He was never going to change, never going to change.'\n\nOf him choosing drugs over her she said: 'That\u2019s why I\u2019m so angry. Makes you feel worthless.'\n\n'I got lots of stuff in social media, \"I've got blood on my hands\", I left George and I will not be blamed for his death.\n\nKerry said her daughter Molly and current boyfriend Ryan have been incredibly supportive since George passed away.\n\nShe said: 'When he died Molly didn't leave my side. And Ryan has been so great and when I cry he understands.\n\nBeing blamed: Kerry said: 'I got lots of stuff in social media, \"I've got blood on my hands\", I left George and I will not be blamed for his death'\n\nOn how she\u2019s coping, she said: 'My children, having [partner] Ryan by my side. If I\u2019m sad, he\u2019s saying \"I\u2019m sorry you feel like that\" and \"You deserve better\". That\u2019s been a massive help.\n\n'I go to church. I've always been very spiritual, I believe in God and Jesus.\n\n'It's so uplifting and I come home from church every Sunday in such a good mood.\n\nKatona married Kay in September 2014, months after giving birth to Dylan-Jorge however the couple divorced in 2017.\n\nThere had reportedly been a restraining order issued keeping George away from Katona at the time of his death.\n\nCheshire Police's statement in full...

'The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the coroner. 'As with any death following police contact, Cheshire Constabulary has referred the matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.'\n\nKay and Katona initially met during their teenage years at at Padgate High School in Warrington where they were childhood sweethearts.\n\nThe former couple rekindled their romance during their thirties while Katona was on her book tour for Too Much Too Young and Kay worked as her security guard.\n\nDuring their three-year marriage Kay battled mental health issues and Katona later claimed that he had been violent towards her throughout their relationship.\n\nShe previously split from him in October 2015 after thirteen months together and a month later appeared in court accusing him of beating her up at their home, after allegedly arming himself with a Taser-style device and a knife.\n\nHowever he was later acquitted after prosecutors revealed that they didn't have enough evidence to secure a conviction.\n\nA matter of months later, the pair first sparked reconciliation rumours when they were spotted out together with their daughter Dylan-Jorge.\n\nSupporting her: Kerry was joined by (L-R) Coleen Nolan, Stacey Solomon, Janet Street-Porter and Gloria Hunniford\n\nThe couple were so determined to make their relationship work and appeared on the reality show In Therapy to talk through their issues and even blissfully renewed their wedding vows in November 2016.\n\nSpeaking shortly after the reconciliation, Kerry insisted to OK! magazine that George 'wasn't a monster' and they both had 'fiery tempers'.\n\nShe explained: 'There was never a restraining order, that was reported incorrectly.'\n\n'He was allowed to come and pick up DJ when he wanted. I've never felt threatened. I've been no angel in this either. I can get angry and mad, too', she added. However, the pair officially called it quits and divorced in 2017.\n\nKerry is a doting mother to five - she has two daughters with ex Westlife partner Brian McFadden Molly, 16, and Lilly-Sue, 14.\n\nShe also shares Heidi, 10, and Maxwell, nine, with second husband Mark Croft.\n\nFor confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit a local Samaritans branch, or see samaritans.org for details.", "description": "Kerry Katona broke down in tears on Wednesday's episode of Loose Women when she discussed estranged husband George Kay's death in her first TV interview.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/13/20082926-0-image-a-83_1571834283272.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
