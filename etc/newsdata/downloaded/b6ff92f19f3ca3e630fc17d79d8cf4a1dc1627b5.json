How Leicester\u2019s defence thrived despite selling \u00a380m Maguire | Paul Doyle Read more\n\nRodgers faces his former club on Saturday for the first time since his dismissal when Leicester aim to halt Liverpool\u2019s imperious start to the Premier League season and run of 16 consecutive league wins. The 46-year-old was sacked in October 2015 having failed to correct a downturn that commenced the previous campaign. Klopp, who succeeded Rodgers as Liverpool manager four days later, believes his predecessor\u2019s coaching acumen was never doubted at Anfield but a fracture behind the scenes may have contributed to his departure.\n\nThe Liverpool manager said: \u201cBrendan\u2019s quality could not be the reason because I know how Liverpool were playing before and they were flying. We played them with Dortmund (in a pre-season friendly in August 2014). We were not in the best shape that day and we lost 4-0. They played really well and I already respected him as a manager.\n\n\u201cFor the public, when a manager gets the sack, they think he lost his football brain or something. That is not how it happened. Whatever it was I do not know, but it was not his quality as a coach. But of course, expectations and relationships, whatever, between who and who, if that does not work anymore the club has to make a decision. I know that could happen about me. If one day the club has to make a decision they would not say anything about me at that moment. Brendan reached the level he reached \u2013 Chelsea assistant, Swansea manager, Liverpool manager \u2013 very young, then going to Celtic and being very successful. Going to Leicester just proves what I thought. I am not a bit surprised.\u201d", "description": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp said Brendan Rodgers was not sacked by Liverpool for losing his \u2018football brain\u2019 but possibly over a breakdown in his relationship with the Anfield hierarchy", "authors": ["Andy Hunter"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01ff47bc162b9a96ceb8c4d96e85c9e8ce84ace8/0_22_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7c60e1c57937f1c162a78b44925164ee", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
