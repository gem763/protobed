Fishing mini-games bring bite-sized blasts of outdoorsmanship to our adventures, and while some players hate them, I\u2019ve found there\u2019s fun to be had when fishing\u2019s done right. Here\u2019s a list of some of the best.\n\nThe true joy of a fishing mini-game comes from mixing challenge with relaxation. You can relax and watch the rippling waters, but when the time comes and you get a bite, you\u2019ve got to put in some work and battle with a scaley foe. These fights range from being complex simulations of actual fishing to bubbly arcade romps. Using completely arbitrary but totally scientific methods, I have collected the top five recent fishing mini-games and present them to you, dear reader, in no particular order.\n\nStardew Valley\n\nStardew Valley has plenty going on, from farm management to dungeon-crawling and romances. It also has a simple but enjoyable fishing game. If you\u2019re dedicated enough, you can ditch the farm life for a salty sea-faring lifestyle. Whenever you cast your rod and get a bite, a small metre moves up and down.\n\nThe goal is to keep your icon within a small section of that metre. It\u2019s not too complicated, but the tougher fish are incredibly erratic and require quick thinking and even some anticipation to keep on the hook. This mini-game is a good split between light-hearted fun and a more serious enterprise. Just try not to be mad when you occasionally reel in seaweed or a stick.\n\nYakuza 6: The Song of Life\n\nThe Yakuza series is known for its vibrant characters and melodramatic storylines. It\u2019s gaming\u2019s best soap opera. Beyond all the crime and drama, there are tons of side quests and activities to while away your time. Yakuza\u2019s had fishing games before, but Yakuza 6 offers a twist: speargun fishing.\n\nScowling ex-Yakuza and all-around good dude Kazuma Kiryu can don a wetsuit and blast through an arcade shoot-fest befitting the Sega pedigree. There\u2019s even boss battles against sharks and octopi. It\u2019s silly, but it\u2019s a great balance to all the plotting and bloody martial arts battles.\n\nFire Emblem: Three Houses\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that Professor Byleth loves more than her students, it\u2019s fishin\u2019 and more fishin\u2019. Raising teenagers to become dangerous mercenaries and world leaders is exhausting, and it gets even harder when plots conspire to make them battle each other.\n\nFishing is a great way to earn experience in your professor rank, which gives you more activity points, allowing you to do more with your limited free time. (It also helps that fishing doesn\u2019t use up an of those points.) The mini-game itself is pretty standard: press the buttons at the right time to snag a fish. But, much like its distant inspiration, Suikoden 2, the context is hilarious. Teacher, warrior, general, bass fisher. Byleth is all these things and more.\n\nFinal Fantasy XV\n\nWhile Final Fantasy XIV offers an entire fishing profession as a viable way to play, it\u2019s Final Fantasy XV that really nails it. Pick your bait and cast a line, then wait a while, until Prince Noctis ends up in an intense fishing battle with his quarry. It\u2019s a mixture of managing your fishing line\u2019s strain, reeling in the fish, and tiny quick-time events to press the right button.\n\nIt\u2019s a fun mini-game made even better by a collection of side quests that allow you to catch truly gargantuan fish. I\u2019m talking 45kg swamp bloobers and alligator-length legendary trout. Final Fantasy XV is often a serious game, but these little side adventures add a lot of charm.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time\n\nHow could I not include this? For a lot of older gamers, Ocarina of Time\u2019s fishing pond was their first experience with digital fishing. In our young, foolish youths, many of us battled to catch the Hylian Loach.\n\nSure, you could cheat using the sinking lure, or you could stand on the log in the middle of the pond, but True Gamers\u2122 did it the hard way. This isn\u2019t just a fun fishing mini-game. It\u2019s the fishing mini-game.", "description": "Sometimes, between fighting monsters or zombies with swords or guns or whatever, you want to kick back and enjoy a different type of challenge in a video game.
