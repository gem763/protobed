That\u2019s up from the 25.6 million Americans, or 7.9% of the population, in 2017. It\u2019s the first annual increase since 2009.\n\nThe overall public health-insurance coverage rate declined by 0.4% to 34.4% of the population, while private health-insurance coverage rates, typically offered through an employer, remained steady at 67.3% of the population.\n\nResearchers said government programs like Medicaid and Medicare are regarded as public coverage. Plans purchased through the federal marketplace established by the 2010 Affordable Care Act counted as private coverage, the report added.\n\nMore children, ages 19 and under, lacked health-care coverage in 2018 compared to a year earlier.\n\nSome 17.9% of Americans had Medicaid in 2018, a 0.7% drop in coverage, but Medicare coverage increased to 17.8%, a 0.4% increase. Medicaid provides public health insurance for people with low incomes who aren\u2019t elderly. Medicare provides public health insurance for people aged 65 and older, and for some younger people with disability.\n\nMore children, ages 19 and under, lacked health-care coverage in 2018 compared to a year earlier: approximately 5.5% of America\u2019s youth didn\u2019t have health insurance, up 0.6% from the previous year.\n\nChildren from middle-class families experienced the biggest drop in health coverage: 2.6% of children from families making 400% above the poverty line \u2014 about $100,000 per year \u2014 lacked insurance last year, up 0.7% on the year.\n\nLaryssa Mykyta, chief of the Census Bureau\u2019s Health and Disability Statistics Branch, offered one theory. She said some children may have lost eligibility under certain state plans. Income eligibility for Medicaid varies by state.\n\nThe rising rate of uninsured people is worrying, but not surprising, said Rachel Garfield, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation and co-director of its Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.\n\nOne possible reason for the increase is that people are making too much money in new jobs to be eligible for Medicaid, but aren\u2019t getting health insurance through their employer, Garfield said.\n\nGarfield said she\u2019s also been hearing anecdotally of waning Medicaid coverage in immigrant communities \u201cout of fear or misunderstanding of different policies related to immigration status.\u201d Many immigrants deemed \u201cqualified non-citizens\u201d have a five-year waiting period before they can enroll in Medicaid, according to U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: This all-too common life event can double your risk of filing for bankruptcy\n\nAlso Tuesday, the Census Bureau released data showing that the median household income climbed to $63,179, up from $62,626 a year earlier. The new rise, however, wasn\u2019t statistically significant, census officials said. Median annual earnings for all workers rose 3.4% to $40,247.\n\nAs income levels rise, coinciding with a 10-year bull market and 3.7% unemployment, poverty levels have been falling: 11.8% of Americans were living in poverty last year, down from 12.3% in 2017. The official poverty rate hasn\u2019t been this low since 2001, when it was 11.7%.\n\nThe Census numbers also offer another way to calculate the prevalence of poverty. The supplemental poverty measure calculates all the money a household brings in from wages, public assistance and tax credits. It then subtracts the cost of necessities like child care, housing and health care costs.\n\nThe supplemental poverty measure essentially stayed flat, going from 13% in 2017 to 13.1% in 2018.\n\nH. Luke Shaefer, director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Poverty Solutions initiative, said the poverty information showed \u201cgood signs at this stage of a long economic expansion.\u201d\n\nShaefer said the supplemental poverty rate presented a more nuanced picture. \u201cThis seems to have to do with the rising living costs facing renters in particular,\u201d he said.", "description": "More children, ages 19 and under, lacked health-care coverage in 2018 compared to a year earlier.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR015_doc_ki_ZG_20190910120843.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
