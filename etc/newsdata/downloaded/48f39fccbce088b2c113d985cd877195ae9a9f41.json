Everything felt like a chore, the match, the event, the performance and the result.\n\nIt was always likely to be a slog this season, but no matter how hard you prepare yourself for that fact, it does not ease the realisation that supporting Newcastle is a largely joyless pursuit again.\n\nThere are some pluses for manager Steve Bruce. Newcastle have tightened up, they are difficult to break down and there were some flashes of something that vaguely reflected an attacking threat, at least in the first half, but it did not hang around after half time.\n\nHaving shaded things before the break, Newcastle dug in and tried to defend the lead they had secured through captain Jamaal Lascelles\u2019s header, but failed and were a little fortunate to come away with the draw as Wolves missed a flurry of late chances after Sean Longstaff\u2019s red card had reduced them to ten men.", "description": "It is not much fun watching Newcastle United, a team that is hard to beat but tough to like, as this turgid draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers simultaneously lifted them out of the drop zone and reinforced why they will remain in a relegation battle.", "authors": ["Luke Edwards", "Jj Bull", "Chris Bascombe", "Keith Hackett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214317123-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqe8EOArUxzcOfIfa2qlTi9V-EaplQ5Loirczi8NuujLc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
