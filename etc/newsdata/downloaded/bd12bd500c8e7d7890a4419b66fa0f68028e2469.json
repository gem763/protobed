Update newsletter preferences\n\nLocal media reported that Balliet is from the Saxony-Anhalt region of Germany, and a document posted online said he had driven 45 minutes to the synagogue from his home.\n\nDer Spiegel reported that he had no criminal record and lived with his mother in Benndorf, where neighbours described him as a lonely figure who lived an \u201cisolated life\u201d.\n\nA source told Reuters that Balliet had done military service, which was compulsory in Germany at the time, but received no special training.\n\nBalliet\u2019s livestream and online documents seen by The Independent suggest he was deeply embedded in online forums, gaming culture and had a fascination with Japan.\n\nHe called himself a \u201cweeb\u201d, denoting an obsession with Japanese culture, and an \u201canon\u201d \u2013 the term used to describe users of 4chan, 8chan and other imageboards that were used by previous mass shooters to share manifestos.\n\nOne of three documents Balliet posted online before the attack was entitled \u201cmanifesto\u201d in Japanese and included an image of a sexualised anime \u201ccat-girl\u201d.\n\nThe tongue-in-cheek message said that readers could get a free cat-girl or \u201cwaifu\u201d if they \u201ckill at least one Jew\u201d.\n\nThe document, written in English, called for \u201cdiscontent white men\u201d to murder Jews, non-whites, communists and \u201ctraitors\u201d.\n\nAnother document linked to Balliet\u2019s livestream on Twitch, which is predominantly used by gamers to broadcast online play.\n\nThe third, also written in English, contained details of Balliet\u2019s preparations for the attack and included images of his six guns, which he claimed to have made or modified himself.\n\nBalliet also listed homemade ammunition and improvised hand grenades, smoke grenades, pipe bombs and small explosives, which he said he had \u201cprepared months in advance\u201d.\n\nThe document said he aimed to inspire other attacks by \u201cother suppressed whites\u201d by livestreaming his attack, kill as many \u201canti-whites\u201d as possible, and that he would wear protective clothing and aimed not to die.\n\nIt included a score sheet of \u201cachievements\u201d for the attack, including numbers of kills and methods, but few were met.\n\nThe documents appear to have been originally posed on the Kohlchan website, which is a predominantly German-language \u201cchan\u201d imageboard whose name translates as \u201ccabbage chan\u201d or \u201cnonsense chan\u201d.\n\nBalliet said he had \u201coriginally planned to storm a mosque or an antifa \u2018culture\u2019 centre\u201d which he thought would be less defended than the synagogue targeted.\n\nBut he claimed his ultimate target was Jews after declaring his belief in conspiracies including the \u201cZionist-occupied government\u201d theory.\n\nSpeaking in English at the start of his livestream, Balliet said he was a Holocaust denier and said he believed feminism was \"the cause of declining birth rates in the West\".\n\nThere were initially fears that more than one attacker was at large, following numerous witness reports of shootings in different locations, but police wound down an extensive search operation on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nLocal police said Halle and the Saale region had been given the \u201call clear\u201d by security forces, following the closure of railway stations and tightened border controls.\n\n\u201cThe threat level for the public is no longer classified as acute,\u201d a statement said. \u201cYou can return to the streets, the warnings are lifted.\u201d\n\nLocal residents had been told to remain inside their homes or find places of safety as the manhunt continued.\n\nThe attack came during Yom Kippur, a Jewish religious festival that sees observers fast and pray to atone for sins.\n\nA spokesperson for the local Jewish community said up to 80 worshippers were inside the synagogue at the time, but security measures at its entrance \u201cwithstood the attack\u201d.\n\nSeveral people were injured in the shooting, where Balliet also opened fire at random in Halle, but many of those seen in the video, including an elderly cyclist and passing motorists and pedestrians, were spared.\n\nThe footage been removed from the Twitch website but is being spread online on \u201cchan\u201d websites, mainstream social media and the encrypted Telegram messaging application.\n\nApart from asides and frequent cursing in German, Balliet spoke English in the livestream and also wrote all three documents he posted online in English.\n\nA livestream was also made by the Christchurch shooter, who used Facebook Live, and posted a \u201cmanifesto\u201d espousing a theory that white people are being eradicated from Western nations on the 8chan image board.\n\nThe attack inspired copycat terrorists around the world, including in the UK, Norway and the American cities of El Paso and Poway - where a synagogue was attacked.\n\nOn the 4chan website, some posters were comparing the Halle shooter to \u201cSaint [Brenton] Tarrant\u201d, while another wrote: \u201cKill society, one lone gunman at a time. F***, I\u2019m lovin it.\u201d\n\nOthers ridiculed the shooter for failing to kill more victims and using homemade weapons.\n\nA right-wing extremist chat group dedicated to Tarrant urged followers to \u201clearn from others\u2019 mistakes\u201d when launching future attacks.\n\nAs officials sought to reassure the Jewish community and address concern about rising right-wing extremism, Germany's president visited the scene of the attack in Halle and urged his nation to stand up for its Jewish compatriots.\n\n\u201cIt is not enough to condemn such a cowardly attack,\" Frank-Walter Steinmeier said. \u201cIt must be clear that the state takes responsibility for the safety of Jewish life in Germany.\n\n\u201cHistory reminds us, the present demands of us\u201d that Germans must stand by their Jewish compatriots, he said. \u201cThose who so far have been silent must speak out.\u201d\n\nJustice Minister Christine Lambrecht said right-wing extremism \u201cis one of the biggest threats facing us\u201d and vowed to take action on online platforms containing material that incites hatred.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel said Germany must crack down on hate, violence and hostility.\n\n\u201cI am, like millions of people in Germany, shocked and dejected by the crime that was perpetrated in Halle ,\u201d she told a trade union congress in Nuremberg.\n\n", "description": "The neo-Nazi who murdered two people in a marauding shooting attack in Germany has been named as Stephan Balliet.
