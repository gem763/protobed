Which means if you want to be spoiler free for the story campaign you better watch yourself.\n\nThe same thing happened with Call Of Duty: WWII in 2017 but with that game people couldn\u2019t get round the need for a day one patch, this time though all you have to do is disable the Internet before you start playing.\n\nGiving away 2 early copies of Modern Warfare! \ud83d\udd01 & \ud83d\udda4 this tweet & follow @bblakedesigns for a chance to win!

So there\u2019s another reason for publishers to prefer digital sales over physical.\n\n*** WARNING: SPOILERS (BUT NOT FROM THE LEAK) ***\n\nOfficially, very little is known about the Modern Warfare campaign, which is a reboot of the first game. While it still stars Captain Price it appears to have a different story, but still features rogue Russian generals and a section in the Middle East.\n\nThe campaign has already been compared to the infamous No Russian mission from Modern Warfare 2, in terms of purposefully drumming up controversy, and reportedly features a gas attack on a children\u2019s playground and SAS soldiers potentially injuring civilians in a London townhouse.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare will not have loot boxes at launch says Infinity Ward\n\nMORE: Fans angry at Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare Survival mode PS4 exclusivity\n\nMORE: Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare story trailer from Sony\u2019s State of Play looks super intense", "description": "If you don\u2019t want to be spoiled about Modern Warfare\u2019s story campaign you better be careful where you go on the Internet this week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EHM_jBPWkAA5hI5-795c_1571648026.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
