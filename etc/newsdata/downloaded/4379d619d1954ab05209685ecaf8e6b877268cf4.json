BA, +0.22% dropped 1.6% in premarket trading Tuesday, enough to pace the Dow Jones Industrial Average's DJIA, -0.36% early decliners, after reports of a potential delay in the 737 Max's return to service and a lawsuit by Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, +0.47% pilots. The stock's implied price decline would shave about 38 points off the Dow's price, while Dow futures YMZ19, -0.73% sank 194 points. Heightened safety concerns from European regulators about portions of proposed fixes to 737 Max flight-control systems could delay the return of the Boeing jets to service, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. And the union representing Southwest pilots is suing Boeing, saying the pilots are losing money because the company had rushed an unsafe place into service, only to have the jets grounded following deadly crashes, the Associated Press reported. Boeing's stock has gained 7.2% over the past three months through Monday, while the Dow has slipped 1.2%.", "description": "Shares of Boeing Co. dropped 1.6% in premarket trading Tuesday, enough to pace the Dow Jones Industrial Average's early decliners, after reports of a...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
