Easy, just go and get him. He'd score 20 goals a season for you with his eyes closed,\" said Keane.\n\nAhead of his side's clash with Partizan Belgrade, Solskjaer was asked about a possible move for Tottenham hitman Kane.\n\n(Image: Sky Sports)\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nIn response to Keane's advice, he said: \"Roy is quite straightforward isn\u2019t he.\n\n\"There\u2019s the Kanes and the Lewandowski\u2019s and ours are different types of players but I like someone who can finish half a chance and he\u2019s one of the best but he\u2019s a Tottenham player.\n\n\"Getting Anthony back will be a massive boost for us and that will help Marcus too. I\u2019m looking forward to the next few weeks with the forwards we have.\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nSolskjaer also admitted the Europa League is taking on greater importance for United this season.\n\n\"I think it is important to us and last time we were in it we won it but we can\u2019t rely on a cup tournament.\n\n\"Champions League for next season is an aim through either top four or Europa League. But we are in November and talking about being not four.\"", "description": "Roy Keane insisted United should make a move for England and Tottenham talisman Kane after the draw with Liverpool", "authors": ["Liam Prenderville", "Image", "Sky Sports", "Empics Sport", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708970.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Europa-League-Manchesdter-United-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
