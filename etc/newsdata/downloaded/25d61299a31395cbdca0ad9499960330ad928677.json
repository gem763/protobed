And it suggested that the judge, Indira Talwani, agreed with prosecutors that a term of imprisonment \u2014 even a short one \u2014 was necessary to send a message that wealthy parents would not get away with trying to steal admissions slots from more deserving students.\n\nMs. Huffman\u2019s lawyers had argued for a sentence of probation. They said that prison was not needed as a deterrent in Ms. Huffman\u2019s case because she had already suffered enough \u2014 being publicly shamed, seeing her acting career crater, and incurring the anger of her family.\n\nEven before the sentencing, questions were being raised about fairness and whether Ms. Huffman and the other defendants would receive lighter punishments than poor and nonwhite defendants convicted of similar crimes.", "description": "The actress is the first parent to be sentenced for her role in the nation\u2019s largest college admissions cheating prosecution.", "authors": ["Kate Taylor"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/us/13HUFFMAN-live/13HUFFMAN-live-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
