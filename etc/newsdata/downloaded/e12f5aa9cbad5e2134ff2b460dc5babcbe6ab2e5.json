The party has said it will only back an early election when a no-deal Brexit scenario can be firmly ruled out.\n\nThe chancellor told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe opposition have said, week after week, that if there is a delay of three months, which is what they requested through parliament, then they will vote for a general election, so let\u2019s see if they keep their word.\n\n\u201cAnd if they don\u2019t then we will keep bringing back to parliament a motion to have an election. And we will keep doing that again and again.\u201d\n\nThe EU\u2019s plan to offer the UK an extension until 31 January is expected to be put on hold until Monday, with sources saying the latest developments in Westminster need to be fully understood before Brussels can make its move.\n\nJavid, who pulled his November budget 24 hours after insisting it would go ahead, after Johnson\u2019s election ultimatum, said parliament had chosen to delay at every opportunity and he believed a three-month extension from the EU was very likely.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have to end this uncertainty. We\u2019ve tried everything we can. We don\u2019t have a majority in parliament, so it does require some cooperation by the opposition. And, instead of Jeremy Corbyn, as the leader of the opposition, thinking about the national interest, he has decided to put his own interests first and dither and delay.\u201d\n\nShortly afterwards, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, tweeted: \u201cMessage to Sajid Javid: Stop playing games putting our economy at risk.\n\n\u201cIf you won\u2019t bring a budget forward, move over and I will. Your irresponsible party political messing around will cost people their jobs. Grow up.\u201d\n\nDiane Abbott said Labour needed an explicit commitment that a no-deal scenario would be ruled out, which could mean further legislation in parliament.\n\nThe shadow home secretary told Today: \u201cThe Labour party is definitely up for an election, but there are two things we need to know. One is what sort of extension the EU is going to give \u2013 and, as you say, we won\u2019t know until Monday.\u201d\n\nAbbott said the party also wanted to hear from the prime minister that he would take no deal off the table. \u201cBut be in no doubt, party members, and the party as a whole, is ready for and keen for an election,\u201d she said.\n\nAbbott said offers from Johnson were \u201cnot worth the paper they\u2019re written on\u201d. She said: \u201cThe December day is a ludicrous day. We\u2019ve not had a general election at Christmas for over a century, and there are good reasons for that.\u201d\n\nThe comments came as Laura Lock, deputy chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, outlined potential problems with a December election, including a lack of polling stations.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe have issues getting polling stations generally. There\u2019s less and less public buildings available for people to use, but one of the key challenges that we have in December is that the polling stations already have bookings.\n\n\u201cFor May polls they\u2019re expecting us on the first Thursday in May. Here, we\u2019re not even convinced all of the time that the election will take place on a Thursday. So, this morning I\u2019m sure that our 2,000 members will be getting on the phones trying to book polling stations provisionally for 12 December.\n\n\u201cBut again, we don\u2019t know whether the legislation will pass. We might be ending up doing it again for a different date very shortly.\u201d\n\nLock said people should expect polling stations in unexpected places. She said: \u201cSo it could be that people actually end up voting in garages or caravan awnings we\u2019ve had in the past and things like that.\u201d\n\nLock said people also might receive their postal vote slightly later than officials would like, because of printing not going ahead until confirmation of an election date.\n\nShe said some people who would ordinarily vote by post might want to consider a proxy vote. Lock said returning officers were already starting to think about contingency planning for bad weather, deciding if extra gritters would be required, and making sure there would be sufficient lighting.", "description": "Chancellor says Tories will insist on election but experts outline problems with pre-Christmas vote", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c7c409db625271b5e83011dca07ebd6ee3d43c8/0_100_3332_2000/master/3332.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=98be8fe3f4123dcafd3e89a48a10ae6e", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
