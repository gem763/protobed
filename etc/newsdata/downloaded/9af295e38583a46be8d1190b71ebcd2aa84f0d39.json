They\u2019re allegations of a crime.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s shocking to all of us here who\u2019ve sat with Matt for many, many years\u201d.\n\nGuthrie added: \u201cI think I speak for all of us: we\u2019re disturbed to our core.\u201d\n\nLauer, Guthrie and Kotb all used to work together on the Today show prior to Lauer\u2019s 2017 sacking. After he was dismissed, Kotb became Guthrie\u2019s official co-anchor.\n\nNevils\u2019s allegations, shared by Variety, appear in Ronan Farrow\u2019s upcoming book Catch & Kill, which will be released on 15 October.\n\nLauer denied the claims on Wednesday, saying in a letter published by Variety that he had a consensual affair\u201d with Nevils. \u201cIn a new book, it is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault. It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense,\u201d Lauer says in the missive.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Lauer\u2019s representative for comment.", "description": "Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb say a new rape accusation against Matt Lauer have left them \u201cdisturbed to [their] core\u201d.
