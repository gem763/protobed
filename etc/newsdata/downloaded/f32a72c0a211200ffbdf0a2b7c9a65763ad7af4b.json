(The Logic)\n\nTalking point: Shrinking family sizes and the aging baby boomers (the oldest will turn 75 next year) are putting pressure on both the paid system and on unpaid labour. According to the report, there will be about 120 per cent more adults using home-care support by 2050, but 30 per cent fewer close family members to provide that support. It\u2019s a looming demographic cliff, but as The Logic\u2019s editor-in-chief David Skok wrote recently, it\u2019s been largely ignored during this federal election. If family members are unwilling or unable to provide unpaid care, shifting that cost to the public purse would add another $27 billion in annual costs by 2050, on top of the $71 billion. Other countries have found innovative solutions to tackle this problem. Denmark and the Netherlands pay for time off spent caring for family; Germany and Norway top up caregivers\u2019 pension funds; and Japan has a universal long-term care program funded by higher taxes.", "description": "", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
