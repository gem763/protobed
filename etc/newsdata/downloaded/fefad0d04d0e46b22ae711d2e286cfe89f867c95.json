Who knows how many veterans relied on such a misrepresentation \u2014 for that is what it was \u2014 in deciding not to appeal VA decisions that denied reimbursement for non-VA emergency medical care,\u201d the judges said. \u201cAll of this is unacceptable.\"\n\nCITIZENS COME TOGETHER TO BUILD CUSTOM HOMES FOR DISABLED VETS: 'IT'S OUR WAY OF SERVING OUR COUNTRY'\n\nThe judges ruled that the VA can\u2019t send out its \u201ccorrective\u201d notices that contain the following language: \"It is important to note that VA has no legal authority to pay a veteran's cost shares, deductibles or copayments associated with their other health insurance,\u201d as that isn\u2019t a correct interpretation of the regulation.\n\nThe VA told Fox News the agency \" is aware of this decision and reviewing it.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "The Department of Veterans Affairs\u00a0has been ordered to reimburse veterans for\u00a0the cost of their emergency care\u00a0at non-VA hospitals\u00a0- something the agency has actively told veterans they are not entitled\u00a0to,\u00a0an appeals court ruled this week.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/e3f15835-va.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
