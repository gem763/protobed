(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d\n\nJaw thrust forward and ready to rumble, President Donald Trump plowed his way through a day of questions Wednesday about his controversial phone call with Ukraine\u2019s leader, his private anger about the House impeachment effort bursting into full public view.\n\n\u201cDid you hear me? Did you hear me? Ask him a question,\u201d the president, pointing to his counterpart from Finland, irritably told a reporter who pressed Trump to answer a question during a surreal and scorching White House news conference.\n\nFor days, the president had seethed about the Democrats\u2019 rapidly moving inquiry that threatens to overwhelm his presidency. He insisted he did nothing wrong in what he repeatedly dubbed \u201ca perfect call\u201d with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which he asked for an investigation of political opponent Joe Biden. Trump\u2019s rage behind closed White House doors found myriad targets: Democrats, the media, his own staff, the faltering performances of Republicans trying to defend him on television.\n\nThough the president had let off some steam on Twitter, it took until Wednesday\u2019s meetings with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto for Trump to erupt. Lacking a strong White House response team or many allies willing to make his case, while always believing that he is his own best spokesman, Trump became a one-man war room as the afternoon went on.\n\nThe news conference, taking place in the East Room on an unseasonably warm early October day in Washington, started innocently enough.\n\nIt featured the usual talk about strong cooperation between the two nations. Trump offered America\u2019s condolences for an attack the day before at a vocational school in Finland in which a man wielding a sword and a firearm killed a woman and wounded nine others.\n\nBut Niinisto, who appeared bewildered in the Oval Office hours earlier during a previous Trump tirade, found his footing at the news conference. He seemed to send a subtle message when he remarked how he had spent part of his time in Washington prior to his White House meeting by visiting a couple of museums.\n\n\u201cYou have here a great democracy. Keep it going on,\u201d he told the president.\n\nTrump soon turned to trade. The president, as he often does, complained about the trade deficit in goods with EU countries, which hit $169.3 billion last year.\n\n\u201cWe're gonna have to start doing something with the European Union because they have not been treating this country right for many, many years. And they know it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBut Niinisto tried to emphasize a different story: \u201cWell, we all know Europe needs USA, but I say that USA needs also Europe,\u201d Niinisto said. \u201cWe know the price of everything. We should recognize also the value of everything. We share the same values: democracy, human rights, rule-based order. And in that we are very similar.\u201d\n\nBut those grand sentiments soon gave way to questions about dirty politics.\n\nFurious about the impeachment inquiry, Trump said he was under attack for three years, blasted the completed special counsel\u2019s Russia probe and said he was considering filing a major lawsuit, though he didn\u2019t say who it would be against.\n\n\u201cWe've been investigating the corruption having to do with what they did to my people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey destroyed many people. They came down to Washington to do a great job and they left home, they left Washington dark.\u201d\n\nHe said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hands out subpoenas like they\u2019re cookies. \u201cEvery day, you get subpoenas.\u201d\n\nHis ire only grew when one reporter, Jeff Mason from Reuters, asked Trump to make clear what he wanted the president of Ukraine to do with regard to former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nTrump dodged with a non-answer, saying he did not like giving money to a corrupt country. \u201cI don\u2019t like being the sucker country,\u201d he said. \u201cEuropean countries are helped far more than we are and those countries should pay more to help Ukraine.\u201d\n\nBut when the reporter followed up about what he wanted Ukraine to do about the Bidens, Trump angrily tried to stop the inquiry, backing away from the podium and asking, \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d while trying to badger Mason to stop.\n\nPreferring to take his questions in informal settings, like the White House lawn against the backdrop of a whirring helicopter, making it easier to skip inquiries he didn\u2019t like, Trump seemed ill-prepared to handle Mason\u2019s follow-ups.\n\n\u201cDid you hear me? Did you hear me? Ask him a question,\u201d Trump ordered, pointing to Niinisto.\n\nMinutes later, the news conference ended and Trump stalked off the stage, again alone.", "description": "Jaw thrust forward and ready to rumble, President Donald Trump plowed his way through a day of questions Wednesday about his controversial phone call with Ukraine\u2019s leader, his private anger about the House impeachment effort bursting into full public view.
