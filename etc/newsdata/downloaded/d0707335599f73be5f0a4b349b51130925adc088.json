He said police were told on Sept. 16 that the waiver had been declined and Sacoolas had left the UK.\n\nCharlotte Charles, mother of Harry Dunn, who died after his motorbike was involved in an August 2019 accident in Britain with Anne Sacoolas, wife of an American diplomat, speaks at a news conference joined by family members on Oct. 14, 2019, in New York.

Once the file is submitted, prosecutors will determine whether they plan to press criminal charges against Sacoolas.\n\n\"You can't complete the file until you have an account from the suspect.

They said any such meeting should happen in England with therapists and mediators on hand.\n\nContributing: David Jackson\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/22/diplomats-wife-fatal-accident-police-interview/4060691002/", "description": "Sacoolas asked to meet officers from Northamptonshire so they could see \"the devastation that this has also caused her and her family,\" police said.", "authors": ["William Cummings", "Published A.M.
