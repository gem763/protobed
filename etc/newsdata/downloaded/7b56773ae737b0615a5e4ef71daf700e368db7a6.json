But it also holds out hope.\n\n\"Distributed generation through biomass, biogas and municipal waste are areas holding great potential for improving municipal revenues. All municipalities have sites for processing waste; they also have sewer outfall sites. Technologies are available for these resources to be added to the generation mix at sub-utility scale,\" the document says.\n\nIn 2016 a waste-water treatment plant in Denmark started generating electricity by harvesting biogas from sewage, making more than enough power to run its own operations. A similar project has been proposed outside Pretoria.\n\nBiomass power is generated from agricultural residue, often wood \u2013 or from the kind of garden refuse that ends up at city dumps.\n\nOther technologies, such as plasma gasification, promise to help turn general waste into electricity, diverting at least a portion of solid waste away from landfill.\n\nMunicipal-level generation would be in keeping with the broad spirit of the 2019 IRP, which calls for both environmental protection and diversification of energy sources.\n\nSee also: Cape Town will use aerial photos to spot unregistered solar panels in suburbs\n\nIt could also soften the impact of customers abandoning municipal grids. Load shedding helps to drive down the willingness-to-pay threshold, the IRP 2019 warns, the cost point beyond which customers either find ways to make their own electricity or just stop paying for municipal power.\n\nBut South African cities have been struggling to take control of their own electricity destinies as they seek to reduce the impact of load shedding on their residents.\n\nCape Town expects the high court to hear its demand for the right to buy electricity directly from independent producers in the first half of next year.\n\nThis week Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba said his city too is \"willing to proceed to the courts\" after Eskom said it is not allowed to directly buy electricity so it can offset load shedding when the national grid is in danger of collapse due to a shortage of supply.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Turning waste into electricity can help municipal finances, the new Integrated Resource Plan says, while Cape Town and Johannesburg complain because they are not allowed to buy and make their own power.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8022/4d8464b5118e43eba5ca9a07358ed923.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
