I don\u2019t think you could go back to those early studies and say they have many implications for what is going on today,\u201d says Barry Lester, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics and the director of the Center for the Study of Children at Risk at Brown University. In the U.S., the THC content of illicit cannabis samples increased from 4 percent in 1995 to 12 percent in 2014, and legal cannabis obtained in 2017 in Washington State was about 20 percent THC, with some products potentially reaching 30 percent or higher. There are little data on how this might affect fetal exposure, but a 2015 abstract described an increase in the concentration of THCA (a THC metabolite) measured in the first bowel movements of Colorado newborns from 213 nanograms per gram in 2012 to 361 in 2014.\n\nThe cannabis used by the women in Dreher\u2019s study wasn\u2019t high in THC, she says. \u201cIt was not anything like the cannabis that we have now.\u201d\n\nLester also collaborated with Dreher in Jamaica in the 1980s, studying the same cohort of babies from her more well-known paper. His study, published with Dreher as a co-author in Child Development in 1989, found that at four and five days of age, the cannabis-exposed newborns had shorter, higher-pitched cries, with more dysphonation and variability. These were the same babies with no difference in behavior at three days old, but Lester says that didn\u2019t surprise him, because the behavioral scales used aren\u2019t typically designed to be as sensitive. \u201cCry acoustics has a long-standing track record of differentiating at-risk kids,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you pick a dependent measure that you know has that kind of sensitivity, you\u2019re obviously more likely to find effects.\u201d\n\nRead: Patients are ditching opioid pills for weed\n\nYet for all their criticism of Dreher\u2019s study, these researchers also wanted to talk about the limitations of the current science and the need for nuanced interpretation.\n\nBecause it would be unethical to randomly assign women to use cannabis while pregnant, the evidence we have on this question is observational and rife with confounding factors. In North America, those who use cannabis are also more likely to use tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs, and to face the challenges that come with poverty, mental illness, and the effects of racism. Researchers try to statistically account for these differences (indeed, each of these factors was identified and accounted for in the Ontario JAMA study), but quantifying all the inequities affecting mothers and their children is a tall order, and a real limitation for the existing evidence.\n\nThat adds uncertainty to researchers\u2019 understanding of the health risks of cannabis, says Jarlenski, the University of Pittsburgh researcher. Still, she rattled off a host of other reasons not to use cannabis while pregnant, including unstandardized potency, the lack of evidence of benefits, the risk of dependency, and the unknowns of how it might interact with postpartum depression. There\u2019s also a risk of being reported to child-welfare services for using a substance that\u2019s still considered a Schedule I drug at the federal level, and poor women of color are likely at greatest risk of this consequence.", "description": "The \u201cJamaica study\u201d has garnered more attention online than 99 percent of scientific research.", "authors": ["Alice Callahan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX106H8/facebook.jpg?1567350820"}
