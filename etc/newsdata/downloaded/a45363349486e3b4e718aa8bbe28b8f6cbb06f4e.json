Call it the homework of adulthood, and many of us are earning a failing grade.\n\nExplore Life Kit This story comes from Life Kit, NPR's family of podcasts to help make life better \u2014 covering everything from exercise to raising kids to making friends.

Make it visible.\n\nRecognize that these tasks are important and deserve your attention.\n\n\"The first part is just seeing that this thing exists and that it's a significant force in our lives,\" Emens says.\n\n2. Know your own administrative personality.\n\nUnderstanding your strengths and weak spots will help you find strategies that work. Emens breaks admin temperaments into four types:\n\nThe super-doer: You get things done and feel good about it.\n\nThe reluctant-doer: You get things done, but wish you didn't have to.\n\nThe admin-avoider: You don't do this stuff and feel bad and maybe a little guilty about it. (You may need to leave important items out where you will see them.)\n\nThe admin-denier: You don't do it and quite frankly feel OK about it \u2014 most likely because someone else will do it for you.\n\n3. Understand how you prefer to work.\n\nDo you like high- or low-tech management systems? Do you tend towards short sprints or marathon problem-solving sessions? Choose a method that works for you and dive in.\n\n\"You've got to know which way is your way, to know which one is going to make you show up for the task and make it as as not-unpleasant as it can be,\" Emens says. \"If you know what your preferences are, then you have a better chance of making a plan for how to deal with stuff that you might otherwise put off.\"\n\n4. Find a buddy and work together.\n\nWe all have these tasks to manage. Why not make it social? Emens invited a group to come over with paperwork they had been avoiding or were behind on. She offered wine and a bite to eat and they all got to work. She calls it \"admin study hall.\"\n\nAnother time she met with a friend to write their wills via videoconference.\n\n\"You know it's a gift we can actually give someone else,\" she says. \"Here's a coupon for an hour of my time, or two hours or three hours, and I'll just sit down with you and deal with whatever the most awful thing is that you're dealing with.\"", "description": "Life seems full of ever-increasing piles of paperwork \u2014 bills to pay, appointments to make, forms to sign, carpools to organize.
