REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nTORONTO (Reuters) - \u2018The Goldfinch\u2019 felt the pressure to live up to the award-winning book upon which the film is based, members of the cast and crew said at the Toronto Film Festival premiere on Sunday.\n\nDonna Tartt won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2014 for her novel about how the death of Theo Decker\u2019s mother in a terrorist attack in the Metropolitan Museum of Art shaped the rest of his life.\n\nThe plot follows Theo after that moment, both in the present and through a series of flashbacks, as he navigates relationships and family, the art world and the criminal underworld, amid the grief of the loss of his mother.\n\nThe film faced the gargantuan task of translating the novel, more than 760 pages long, into a feature-length movie.\n\n\u201cI could definitely feel it when you\u2019d tell people what you were doing,\u201d said Luke Wilson, who played Theo\u2019s deadbeat father. \u201c\u2018Oh it\u2019s \u2018The Goldfinch\u2019. I love that book.\u2019 Almost kind of protectively.\u201d\n\nDirector John Crowley said he had to ignore that pressure.\n\n\u201cThe good thing about filmmaking is that it\u2019s such a crazy, busy job that pretty soon you get too busy to even think about those things,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying make decisions based on your intuition and to try and be true to your own sense of what was special about the story when you read it.\u201d", "description": "'The Goldfinch' felt the pressure to live up to the award-winning book upon which the film is based, members of the cast and crew said at the Toronto Film Festival premiere on Sunday.", "authors": ["Moira Warburton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427794117&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF88049-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
