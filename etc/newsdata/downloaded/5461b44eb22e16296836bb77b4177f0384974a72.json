The Nigeria native arrived in England as a 10-year-old after being trafficked with his sister from the Netherlands. Now he\u2019s back here as an NFL player and a star attraction after first picking up the sport of American football at age 22.\n\nThis marks the Panthers\u2019 first regular-season game outside the United States. That leaves the Green Bay Packers as the only team not to have played an International Series game.\n\nSome of the key games in Week 6 after the early start in London include Deshaun Watson and the Houston Texans visiting Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs and an NFC West showdown between the undefeated San Francisco 49ers and the defending NFC champion Los Angeles Rams.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers got the NFL off to an early start with their meeting in London.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/panthers_buccaneers_football_06219_c0-220-5282-3301_s1200x700.jpg?fd4bf82287e1d009b489b33c928a424af0e8253b", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
