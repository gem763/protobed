Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said during a Thursday interview with The Intercept\u2019s \"Deconstructed\" podcast.\n\nOmar was asked about the field of 2020 candidates and whether she preferred Biden or Buttigieg. She answered, \"None,\" before characterizing their hypothetical nominations as \"tragic.\"\n\nHost Mehdi Hasan asked.\u201cBut if you had to pick one?

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and described him as being someone she could put her faith in because he follows his values, no matter what.\n\n\u201cSometimes you have to be reminded about the vision you truly believe in, and where your core values lie,\u201d Omar said. \u201cAnd for me, I know that there are people that have to switch some things around, and there are people that are just easy to believe in. And I was reminded that Bernie is one of the people.\u201d\n\nOmar officially endorsed Sanders last week, joining fellow \"Squad\" member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who appeared at a rally with Sanders last weekend.\n\nShe also said she feels Trump has put a target on her back, adding that every girl who looks like her is also in danger.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe have done everything that we can to engage them in a conversation about how they\u2019re putting my life in danger and the lives of people who share my identities,\u201d Omar said.\n\n\u201cWhen they describe me as a terrorist, every single Somali girl or Muslim girl that\u2019s walking down the street that resembles me, her life is also in danger.\"", "description": "The idea of 2020 hopefuls Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg facing off against President Trump next November would be a tragedy as the Democratic party continues to forge\u00a0ahead without a true frontrunner,\u00a0Rep.
