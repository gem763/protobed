This has weighed on the income they generate from the lucrative fees accompanying such transactions.\n\nBlackstone Group Inc, the world's largest private equity firm, also reported a decline in its distributable earnings last week, of 8%.\n\nDuring the third quarter, KKR-backed U.S. entertainment and talent agency Endeavor Group Holdings postponed a plan to raise $400 million in an initial public offering (IPO) due to weak market demand for the loss-making firm - a move that hit KKR's capital markets business, which had underwritten the IPO.\n\nKKR said total assets under management climbed to $208 billion, up 7% from a year ago.
