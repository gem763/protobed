But what exactly is an educational psychology (EP) assessment, why has your child\u2019s school asked for one, and how can it help your child to develop?\n\nThe purpose of an EP\u2019s assessment \u2014 a series of different tests \u2014 is to identify your child\u2019s specific learning profile, and any areas of particular strength or need for extra help.\n\nUsing the information gathered from the assessment and evaluation, your child\u2019s teachers will be better able to help support their learning so that they can reach their potential.\n\nWhy has my child been asked to have an educational psychology report?\n\nWhether your child has been assessed by your school\u2019s linked EP, or you have invested in a private assessment yourself, there are many benefits to having a diagnostic assessment when your child is not reaching their potential or is struggling at school.\n\nParents may, understandably, be cautious about the need for such an assessment. But a thorough report carried out by a skilled assessor with extensive training in all aspects of child development that impact learning can really hold the key to unlocking a child\u2019s potential. Understanding a child\u2019s cognitive profile can be hugely informative for parents, teachers and the child themself.\n\nEP assessments cover all the different factors that may be affecting your child\u2019s learning. Common difficulties that may be identified include specific literacy difficulties (dyslexia), specific numeracy difficulties (dyscalculia), processing speed and working memory difficulties, attention deficit and concentration and troubles with confidence and self-esteem.\n\nWhat will I learn about my child?\n\nQuite often, when the EP\u2019s assessment results are shared, it suddenly becomes clear why the child is finding things difficult. For example, the child\u2019s reading or writing speed may be slow compared to their peers, or their verbal ability is high but their processing speed significantly lags behind \u2014 all of which can impact on the child\u2019s ability to keep up in class and to perform according to expectations in examinations.\n\nUnderstandably, these may impact on how they feel about themselves as learners and their general confidence. Importantly, EP reports will most often identify strengths, as well, which can boost a child\u2019s confidence.\n\nHow will this change my child\u2019s experience in school?\n\nSometimes, a child may be misunderstood as not trying in school when, in fact, they are trying very hard. Often what is needed is understanding and discreet support in class.\n\nOnce a child\u2019s cognitive profile is understood, there are usually recognised adjustments that can be made to help them at school. Parents can support them at home using techniques shared by the EP and, significantly, the child can help themselves. Progress can be immediate and dramatic.\n\nHowever, any report is only as good as it what is done with it. What is often less clear is how parents can really make the most of the report and its recommendations.\n\nHere is how to make the most of your child\u2019s evaluation\n\nBefore the Assessment\n\n1. Check with the EP what kind of information their educational psychology report will and will not give you. Assessments can vary: some assess a specific skill or identify strengths and weaknesses, others offer a comprehensive, full-diagnostic assessment.\n\nIt is important to clarify what is being assessed and the rationale for this. Otherwise, key elements may be missed. An EP, cannot diagnose Autism or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), for example, although they can identify whether particular traits are observed and recommend further professional assessments, such as a referral to a paediatrician, or occupational or speech and language therapist.", "description": "If you feel that your child is struggling or failing to meet their potential in school, you may have been advised to get an educational psychology assessment.", "authors": ["Dr Susanna Pinkus", "Tonia Gann", "James Millar"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education-and-careers/2019/09/05/TELEMMGLPICT000163680807-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
