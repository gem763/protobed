Only Liverpool and Arsenal have picked up more, so why isn\u2019t there more attention to their achievements?\n\nWhen Stoke beat Everton this week to rise to eighth place in the Barclays Premier League, the aftermath wasn\u2019t about how well Stoke are doing but instead about the struggling Roberto Martinez and Everton.\n\nStoke are the team who are above Garry Monk\u2019s Swansea \u2013 recently championed after their defeat of Manchester United \u2013 West Ham, Newcastle and the rest of the bottom ten.\n\nSouthampton have exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations this season and receive weekly reviews as the nation\u2019s romance story; neutrals want them to do well, to upset the normal order of the top four.\n\nBut what is it about Stoke City Football Club, who are as high as they can probably ever wish to be, that generates such little media attention or positive write ups?\n\nStoke, as a city, finds itself situated between the bigger and more glamorous cities of Manchester and Birmingham, but it has a lot to offer.\n\nStoke's Michael Duberry tracks Wigan striker Nathan Ellington during a Championship match at the Britannia Stadium in November 2004, which was the defender's first season at the club\n\nCrystal Palace striker Andy Johnson tries to take evasive action as Duberry jumps across to make a tackle during Stoke's 3-1 home defeat by the Eagles in March 2006\n\nDuberry stands all smiles at the Britannia Stadium during his time as a Stoke player. It was a period in the defender's career where he admits he felt wanted by the club in his three-year spell which ended in 2007\n\nWhen I moved to Stoke from Leeds, the city didn\u2019t have a Harvey Nichols or some of the swanky restaurants I left in Leeds, but it didn\u2019t matter. The club gave me a home and a place. I felt wanted - I didn\u2019t want anything else.\n\nI moved near the training ground in nearby Newcastle Under Lyme and was very happy. I had Trentham Gardens, Hanley Shopping centre and Alton Towers was on my doorstep too.\n\nBack when I was a Stoke player the club always seemed to have a power struggle going on upstairs. There was a lack of a clear vision as to who was in charge and the direction in which they wanted to take the club. Then Peter Coates took over in 2006 and the vision became clear.\n\nA Stoke boy and self-made millionaire, Mr Coates has the club at heart and never hides that love. He has made some wise appointments to manage the football team.\n\nStoke were promoted to the Premier League under the management of Tony Pulis, with Duberry playing under the now West Brom boss while at the Potters in the Championship\n\nPulis arranges a training drill at Stoke's training ground in 2012. Duberry described the sessions as regimented and boring, but admits it made the team play better on match days\n\nSince Mark Hughes has taken over, the club have only spent \u00a310m in the transfer market, which is a tremendous job in the current climate of spending.\n\nStoke have become quite successful in finding players to fit the mold, with Hughes and his staff working with head of recruitment Mark Cartwright. They don\u2019t overspend and yet they have created and established a Premier League team.\n\nFinishing 12th,11th, 14th and 13th twice since coming into the Premier League, last season was their highest-ever. with a 9th place finish. But now they are one place higher and playing a more attractive passing style.\n\nDuring my first spell under Tony Pulis, we were very direct, often going back to front in less than two passes. Training was regimented, often just walking through team shape and then doing set pieces. I didn\u2019t like it and found it boring but it made us better on match days and I loved the feeling of a clean sheet.\n\nStoke attracted criticism for their direct style of play after being promoted to the Premier League in 2008, with teams forced into having to form defensive tactics against long Rory Delap throw ins\n\nMark Hughes gives advice to Stoke's Glenn Whelan during a league game against Liverpool, and Duberry claims the Potters have improved their style of play having spent little money under the Welshman\n\nThe next season under Johan Boskamp, everything was totally different. The Dutch manager had a pure footballing philosophy and every training session was 100 per cent football. I loved everything from the training, to the games and to the way he spoke football\n\nWhen Pulis came back the following season, it reverted back to the old regime of pattern of play and set pieces in training. It was very frustrating\n\nIt\u2019s a different club now with a different manager and a different footballing ethos.\n\nYou never see Mark Hughes in the technical area signaling to his players to pass from back to front, but instead he is gesturing to pass the ball and it looks as if the players are enjoying the experience.\n\nI believe they deserve more credit and exposure.", "description": "MICHAEL DUBERRY: Stoke were hated under Tony Pulis, but having improved in all areas under mark Hughes they are being overlooked", "authors": ["Michael Duberry For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/06/2663C35600000578-0-image-a-29_1425662827810.jpg", "published_at": "2015-03-06"}
