The Internet immediately went to work, and \u2014 as they later would with Sarah Jeong \u2014 analyzed her Twitter feed. Again they found tweets that were, in the language of social-justice campaigners, \u201cnot good.\u201d Among the things that were found were a number of tweets from 2013 in which Norton had used the word \u201cfag.\u201d As in \u201cLook, fag\u201d and (on one occasion with another Twitter user with whom she was rowing) \u201cyou s*** eating, hypersensitive little crybaby fag.\u201d On another occasion \u2014 back in 2009 \u2014 Norton was found to have used the most unacceptable word of all. In 2009, in a row with another Twitter user, she had replied, \u201cIf God had meant a n***** to talk to our schoolchildren, He would have would have [sic] made him president. Oh, but wait . . . Um.\u201d Just seven hours after the New York Times had announced its new hire, it backpedaled by saying Norton would not in fact be joining the paper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a subsequent piece in The Atlantic Norton explained what she thought had happened. She acknowledged that many things she had written and tweeted in the past had been ignorant and embarrassing. She also explained what it felt like to, in her words, have a \u201cdoppelganger\u201d version of herself swiftly emerge online. In common with other people who had been the subject of online shaming this version of her that people were railing against was not \u201cwho she was\u201d but a hideous, simplified, out-of-context version of tiny parts of herself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe explained that she believed herself to have been the victim of what she referred to as \u201ccontext collapse.\u201d This is another term for the collapse of the divide between private and public language, where a conversation meant for an in-group becomes known to an out-group with no knowledge of the original context of the discussion. Norton said that her use of the \u201cn\u201d word had been in the context of an online row in which she was \u201cin support of [President] Obama.\u201d Since Norton had been in friendly as well as unfriendly rows with various white racists it was possible that she was using vile language to mirror back at someone who was also using vile language. Elsewhere her engagement with \u201cAnons\u201d (members of the activist collective \u201cAnonymous\u201d) was explained to be the reason for her use of the word \u201cfags.\u201d Such language gets used in such groups, but clearly does not transfer well to the world of the New York Times. The two worlds met, Norton was history there, and the world stampeded on.\n\nBut these cases deserve some reflection. First because cases like Norton\u2019s and Jeong\u2019s invite the question: \u201cWhat is a fair representation of a person in the Internet age?\u201d What is a fair way to describe somebody? Norton, for instance, might henceforth be summed up as \u201cThe racist, homophobic tech journalist fired by the New York Times.\u201d She might think a fairer version of her life would be \u201cWriter and mother.\u201d But then Jeong presumably does not think of herself as a racist either. So who gets to call it? If it is the mob then we are in trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, only the worst version of someone\u2019s life contains the information that makes the Internet stop and look. It is pure gold for a network addicted to shaming and schadenfreude. We all know the glee at watching someone fall from grace; the righteous feeling that can come with joining in the punishment of a transgressor. Even (perhaps especially) if their transgression is for a sin we ourselves have committed. And we know from the work of the anthropologist and philosopher Rene\u0301 Girard of the societal release that can come from the identification of such a scapegoat. So the inclination is to go for the account of a life which is least understanding and least nuanced: most appalling and most appalled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere lies an additional quagmire. There is little enough recourse when old-school journalism tramples across someone\u2019s life. But on the Internet there is not even a regulatory body to appeal to if your life has been raked over in this way. Thousands \u2014 perhaps millions \u2014 of people have been involved, and there is no mechanism to reach all of them and get them to admit that they raked over your life in an unfair manner. Nobody has the time, few people are deemed important enough. There are other people to move on to. And unlike the pool of people the old media might trample over, tech can pick on almost anyone on the planet and spin them around in the tornado. [. . .]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil very recently a slip-up or error made even by a very famous person would be whittled away by time. There are some things so big that they will never be forgotten. Someone being tried in a courtroom or going to prison keeps that on their record. But living in a world where non-crimes have the same effect is especially deranging. What court can be appealed to? Especially when the nature of the crimes, or what constitutes a crime, can vary almost from day to day. What is the correct way to refer to somebody who is trans today? Did you use this word as a joke or an insult? How will what we are doing now look in 20 years? Who will be the next Joy Reid, held to account for the \u201cwrong\u201d view expressed at a time when everybody else was also expressing the \u201cwrong\u201d view? If we do not know the answer to these questions then we have to try to ensure that we can predict the crowd-turns not just of the next year but of the rest of our lives. Good luck with that.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This excerpt was adapted from Douglas Murray\u2019s new book, The Madness of Crowds.", "description": "Living in a world where non-crimes have the same effect as true crimes is especially deranging.", "authors": ["Douglas Murray", "Kevin D.
