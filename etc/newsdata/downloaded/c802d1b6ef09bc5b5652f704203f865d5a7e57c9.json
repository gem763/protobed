Every day \u2014 every few hours, seemingly \u2014 more evidence is uncovered revealing that President Trump is abusing the power of the presidency and is wholly unfit to be president,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cHe is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal political interests instead of the national interest.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe does not understand the immense responsibility demanded of all those who hold the office of the president of the United States,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cHe sees only the power \u2014 and how it can benefit just one person: Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBiden\u2019s move came amid growing anxiety among Biden\u2019s supporters that he is unprepared to handle the dual challenges of running a general-election campaign against Trump while simultaneously facing an intensifying Democratic primary contest.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) has started to eclipse him in several polls, and Biden last week reported raising only $15.2 million during the last quarter \u2014 nearly $10 million less than Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Biden\u2019s supporters also have bridled that Democrats have been slow to rush to Biden\u2019s defense.\n\nAD\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign on Saturday night distributed a memo to reporters from deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield. The subject of the memo highlighted the twin challenges that one of the leading candidates has faced: \u201cBiden Campaign Will Hammer Donald Trump While Focusing On The Issues.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis campaign will continue to focus on the issues that impact people\u2019s lives while simultaneously hammering Donald Trump for his unprecedented abuse of power and correcting the record on the mountain of lies Trump and his allies continue to spread about Joe Biden,\u201d Bedingfield wrote.\n\nShe outlined three strategies that the campaign is attempting to employ: calling out inaccuracies in Trump\u2019s charges, fighting back against Trump, and talking about issues they believe voters care most about.\n\nAD\n\nBiden and his campaign have struggled over the past two weeks amid a flurry of developments that have launched a House impeachment inquiry in which Biden is a central player. Biden has alternated between pushing back on Trump and seeming unsure of how to handle a situation that has placed the focus on his son Hunter.\n\nAD\n\nFor several days at a time, he had few public events, the only responses coming from his remarks at fundraisers at which a handful of reporters are allowed inside. But even then, he has openly ruminated about Trump in various directions.\n\nBiden on Thursday night in San Francisco talked about the allegations, then quickly shifted to say, \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about you.\u201d His focus then turned back toward himself, as he noted how he was the one who defeated Trump in most polls.\n\nAD\n\nHe then went on to talk about his son, making light of a false allegation by Trump that Hunter Biden had made $1.5 billion in China.\n\n\u201cI wonder where the hell that money is, man, because I\u2019ve got to pay tuitions,\u201d Biden said. \u201cGod bless me!\u201d\n\nThen he said aloud that he couldn\u2019t get into the \u201cmosh pit\u201d with Trump because the focus should be on issues like climate change and guns. After devoting several minutes to that, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get sucked into this, what he likes to do.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBiden\u2019s Post op-ed attempted to focus both on Trump\u2019s latest attacks, as well as a broader indictment of his presidency. He criticized the president on climate change and for not doing more to stand up for the rights of protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur first president, George Washington, famously could not tell a lie,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cPresident Trump seemingly cannot tell the truth \u2014 about anything. He slanders anyone he sees as a threat. That is why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me and my family, no doubt hoping to undermine my candidacy for the presidency.\u201d\n\nBiden has bet that voters are familiar with his long tenure in public life, which he hopes will make him more resilient to Trump\u2019s attacks than earlier presidential targets.\n\n\u201cPlease know that I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he wrote, addressing Trump. \u201cYou won\u2019t destroy me, and you won\u2019t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The former vice president shifts strategy and goes on offense amid worries that Trump\u2019s accusations are burying his campaign message.", "authors": ["Matt Viser", "National Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AocLushqqi1NxnUrPLOkGaImqpM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W4KPPUHHZ4I6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
