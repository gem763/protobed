It\u2019s not a celebrity-endorsed brand,\u201d said Emilia Fazzalari, the CEO of Cincoro Tequila and the wife of Boston Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck. \u201cIt was never about that. For us, it has always been about the liquid first.\u201d\n\nThe idea came about three years ago, when Jordan bonded over a love of tequila while having dinner with Grousbeck, Fazzalari, Los Angeles Lakers owner Jeanie Buss and Milwaukee Bucks owner Wes Edens.\n\n\u201cWe wanted this tequila that tasted great,\u201d Fazzalari said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cWe are competitors on the court. We stand across from each other and compete throughout the season. But we are collaborators by nature.\u201d\n\nThe basketball magnates didn\u2019t just write a check and then watch from afar.\n\nJordan was involved in the design of the bottle, working with Mark Smith, the vice president of innovation special projects at Nike. They came up with a five-sided crystal container - a reference to the five leaves of the agave plant - that tilts up at a 23-degree angle - a nod to Jordan\u2019s uniform number.\n\n\u201cMichael\u2019s influence was really as a true tequila lover and a person who only does things right,\u201d Grousbeck said.\n\nEdens brought knowledge of supply chain logistics to the group. There were weekly conference calls, and meetings. Together the partners tasted 1,000 different blends before settling on a flavor.\n\n\u201cAll the partners are actively involved in the company, and we all have been from Day 1,\u201d Fazzalari said. \u201cThey\u2019re not silent partners.\u201d\n\nCincoro is bottling four different tequilas, starting with the unaged Blanco that sells for $70. A limited edition Extra A\u00f1ejo, aged 40-44 months, is listed at $1,600 and comes in a black crystal bottle that is inlaid with real gold.\n\nAccording to Russ Pareti, Cincoro\u2019s chief marketing officer, the tequila market is growing by 10% a year. But the ultra-luxury market is expanding by 40% annually.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really a large runway,\u201d he said.\n\nFazzalari would not disclose specific sales or reveal production numbers, except to say they have sold out in some of the 12 U.S. markets they have launched in so far. They hope to be in all 50 states next year, and then take it to Asia and Europe, Grousbeck said.\n\nGrousbeck said NBA owners have been known to go into business together before, on occasion investing in the same company or fund. But he could not recall a time where four or more teams have joined up on a project.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is a good bond among team principals in general.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When Michael Jordan decided to get into the tequila business, he could have slapped his name on the label, maybe autographed a few bottles and sold out the whole run in hours.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jimmy Golen"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
