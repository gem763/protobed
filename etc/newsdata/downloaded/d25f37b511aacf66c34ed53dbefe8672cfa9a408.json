But the secondary effects \u2014 including the loss of confidence and market reactions, will grow to be quite damaging, she said.\n\nGeorgieva\u2019s comments came ahead of the IMF/World Bank annual meetings, set to take place later this month in Washington.\n\nThe IMF chief called on global finance ministers and central bankers to push for \u201creal change\u201d on trade policies.\n\n\u201cThe key is to improve the system, not abandon it,\u201d she said.\n\nGeorgieva said the global economic outlook was troubling.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, we expect slower growth in nearly 90% of the world. The global economy is now in a synchronized slowdown,\u201d Georgieva said.\n\nThe deceleration means that growth this year will fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade. The IMF is set to cut its growth estimates for 2019 and 2020, she said.\n\nGeorgieva said new analysis suggests corporate debt \u201cat risk of default\u201d could rise to $19 trillion in a \u201cmajor\u201d downturn occurs. This amounts to nearly 40% of the total debt of eight major economies.\n\nShe urged countries to focus more attention on strengthening macroprudential tools.", "description": "The cumulative effect of trade conflicts could mean a loss of around $700 billion by 2020, the new IMF chief estimated on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS810_georgi_ZG_20191007170527.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
