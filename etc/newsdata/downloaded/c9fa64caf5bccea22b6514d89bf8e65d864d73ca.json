Read what happened to these people first", "language": "en", "text": "What\u2019s life like after Facebook? Users of the world\u2019s largest social network are once again exploring that question as #DeleteFacebook trends online.\n\nMany consumers vowed to deactivate their accounts in 2018 after revelations that U.K.-based campaign strategy firm Cambridge Analytica used millions of Facebook FB, +0.80% users\u2019 personal data without their permission,\n\nDon\u2019t miss: This is one person you should never unfriend on Facebook\n\nThose who followed through and quit Facebook told MarketWatch they felt relieved to be free from the pressure to always lead a happy life online. But others said they had difficulty staying in touch with family and even difficulties dating.\n\nDespite its recent privacy controversies, Facebook reported an increase in active users of 55 million on the previous quarter, bringing the global total to 2.37 billion active users.\n\nAltogether, some 44% of users between the ages of 18 and 29 deleted the Facebook app from their phone in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, according to a 2018 survey by Pew Research Center.\n\nPew asked 4,594 people about their Facebook habits about two months after the Cambridge Analytica news broke. (A spokesperson for Facebook declined to comment.)\n\nThe #DeleteFacebook hashtag began trending on Twitter once again this week following a report from Politico that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg held private meetings with conservative journalists and commentators over the summer.\n\nHowever, Facebook\u2019s latest second-quarter results suggest that these anti-Facebook trends haven\u2019t had a major effect on the company\u2019s bottom line. Despite its recent controversies, Facebook reported an 8% increase in active users from the previous year, bringing the global total to 2.41 billion monthly active users.\n\nSo what happens when you kiss Facebook goodbye? Here\u2019s what former users had to say about what happened after they deleted or deactivated their account:\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like a crazy ex that never forgets about you\u2019\n\nJax Austin, a travel video blogger who travels the U.S. in a converted school bus, made the decision to delete his Facebook after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But when he tried to, it didn\u2019t work. \u201cThey make it so hard that it\u2019s almost possible to delete it,\u201d Austin said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a crazy ex that never forgets about you.\u201d\n\nOthers had the same trouble Austin did in making a clean break. Facebook is part of an ecosystem of apps. That makes the decision to delete far more complicated. Dating apps such as Tinder IAC, +0.32% and Hinge, and services like Spotify SPOT, +16.17% can all use Facebook to create user profiles.\n\nAustin\u2019s Facebook account was connected with the free web service If This Then That, which posted YouTube GOOG, +1.97% videos to his Facebook profile automatically as a way to generate views for his travel channel. Austin settled for no longer logging into Facebook and turned his personal account into a fan page.\n\n\u2018So much of social life is tied to Facebook\u2019\n\nWhen Allen Watson, a freelance writer from South Carolina, deleted his Facebook account, his mother was the most disappointed of his Facebook friends. \u201cThat\u2019s how she kept in touch with me,\u201d Watson said. \u201cShe wants to show off the things that I do.\u201d\n\n\u2018People react really defensively and almost see a decision like this as an attack on them.\u2019\n\nJillian Clemmons, an artist and astrologer from Los Angeles, mostly found that people were supportive of her choice. But she did encounter some hostility. \u201cPeople react really defensively and almost see a decision like this as an attack on them,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s like how meat-eaters constantly complain about people who are vegetarian. They feel guilty and counter-punch first.\u201d\n\nAnastasia Ashman, an adviser for start-ups and investors who lives in San Francisco, said she quit Facebook when she became uncomfortable after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. One tweet in particular, from national-security expert John Schindler, convinced her to leave.\n\nBut the costs of leaving are \u201chuge,\u201d she said. She has few people\u2019s recent email addresses or phone numbers, and she can no longer rely on Facebook for contacting them. \u201cSo much of social life is tied to Facebook I can\u2019t even get the location information I need for an event I RSVP-ed to for next weekend, since it\u2019s solely on Facebook,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018I am really not interested in whether or not your child is potty trained\u2019\n\nMark Maitland, a writer from Brighton, England, who quit Facebook last year, still uses Twitter and Instagram, but rarely. He now spends more time reading and writing, \u201ctalking and listening to real people,\u201d walking his dog and running in nature.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Your Facebook \u2018cult\u2019 won\u2019t let you quit\n\nSome people gave up Facebook years ago. Nick Vecore, a public relations professional from Leonard, Mich., said he quit Facebook in 2012, because he was simply sick of seeing \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am really not interested in whether or not your child is potty trained,\u201d he said. \u201cI could keep people up-to-date on my life by talking to them in person, by text or through a phone call.\u201d It\u2019s not a total digital social-media detox, however. He too still uses Instagram and uses Twitter TWTR, -0.79% for work.\n\nCourtesy of Mark Maitland Mark Maitland is trying to spend more time off line with his wife and children.\n\nIt can make verifying prospective dates tricky\n\nWatson, the freelance writer, used Facebook to verify the identities of people he had met through dating apps. And while he can still do that if people have relatively public profiles, in most cases he can\u2019t access their accounts because he no longer has one. \u201cI\u2019ve had occasions where I had to call somebody up and ask them to check something out for me,\u201d Watson said.\n\nAnd while he has not yet encountered anyone who was turned off by his lack of a Facebook profile, he does not bring it up when he meets someone new.\n\nCourtesy of Nick Vecore Nick Vecore said he grew tired of reading others\u2019 posts on Facebook.\n\nSome users only have Facebook on their desktop computer\n\nMae Turner, who lives in northeast Texas, initially deactivated her Facebook account in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, after being alarmed at how the company collected the call history information for her Android smartphone.\n\n(Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress last year to answer for some of these issues, including misuse of consumer data. In a statement to the House panel, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s clear now that we didn\u2019t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm \u2026. It was my mistake, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d)\n\nBut less than two weeks after deactivating her account, Turner revived it, because she felt isolated from friends and family. In one particularly troubling instance, it took days before she found out about the death of a close friend\u2019s wife who lived in another state. The news had only been posted on Facebook. Her brother, who still had his account, was the one who relayed it to her.\n\n\u201cI started to feel like I was being left out of the loop,\u201d she said. However, she is now a Facebook \u201clight\u201d user. She only uses the desktop version and does not allow any third parties to access her account information. And if she finds a social network that does not monetize user data? \u201cI\u2019ll bid Facebook a not-so-fond farewell in a heartbeat,\u201d she said.\n\nFacebook\u2019s stock was up 44% year-to-date, while Twitter was up 38% year to date, compared to a rise of 19% in the S&P 500 SPX, +0.56% over the same period and an increase of 16% in the Dow Jones industrial Average DJIA, +0.49%.\n\n(This story was updated on Oct. 15, 2019.)", "description": "#DeleteFacebook is trending again after reports that Mark Zuckerberg met with conservative pundits.", "authors": ["Maria Lamagna", "Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GN332_MLJax0_ZG_20180727145939.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-27"}
