The airline is urging its pilots to go on unpaid leave or transfer to other bases to avoid redundancies of the kind that have resulted from the travel firm\u2019s collapse.\n\nRyanair \u2013 at loggerheads with its pilots over pay and benefits \u2013 wrote to pilots in a number of airports across Europe including Stansted, Manchester and Dublin on Tuesday, encouraging them to take unpaid leave lasting up to 12 months, or to apply for a job in a base with vacancies.\n\n\u201cWith yesterday\u2019s collapse of Thomas Cook with the loss of 9,000 jobs in the UK and potentially a further 13,000 jobs across Europe, we hope that there will be sufficient applications for unpaid leave/part-time, so we do not have to resort to job losses,\u201d state the memos seen by The Independent.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Only 50.5 per cent of shareholders voted in favour.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Some of the notes also said the surplus must be reduced this winter due to delays with the delivery of Boeing Max aircraft. The Boeing 737 Max remains grounded worldwide after two fatal accidents.\n\nThe latest move by Ryanair\u2019s bosses is likely to fuel tensions with the staff who keep its planes flying.\n\nOn Friday, when the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association called off five further days of strikes at the airline, it said: \u201cThe relationship between Ryanair and its pilots in the UK and elsewhere remains acrimonious.\u201d\n\nThe airline\u2019s relationship with its customers is also lacking, according to surveys by Which?.\n\nNaomi Leach at the consumer organisation\u2019s Travel magazine noted that Ryanair has finished bottom of its airline survey for six years in a row, with customers \u201cfed up\u201d with flight cancellations and the flouting of compensation rules.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "Ryanair has doubled down on a veiled threat to cut jobs, by bringing in bankrupt Thomas Cook into an internal spat.
