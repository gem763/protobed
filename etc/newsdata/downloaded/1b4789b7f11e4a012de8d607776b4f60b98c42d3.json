He was easily the best striker in the division. I have always liked Dwight and I've tried to sign him three times but never been able to do it.\n\n'When you see him in training he finishes naturally. So, if you do create the opportunities, then I'm sure he will take them.\n\n'But every goalscorer needs a bit of service, and that's the difficult part of the game.'\n\nMeanwhile, Bruce has bemoaned the loss of Carroll, who will miss Sunday's visit of Wolves after suffering injury at Chelsea.\n\nAndy Carroll misses Sunday's league game after suffering a groin strain against Chelsea\n\nThe 30-year-old had been edging closer to a starting role with the club's medical team having tailored a training schedule to aid his recovery following ankle surgery in March.\n\nAnd Bruce said: 'With Andy, it's not his ankle, thankfully. Everyone can pick up those type of niggles, especially when you sit on the bench for a while. He has stretched for a ball and over-stretched.\n\n'There is no-one more disappointed than Andy. He was getting himself in a position, where the more he trained, getting on against Man United and Chelsea, he was manoeuvering into a position where he could start, so it's disappointing.'", "description": "Steve Bruce is ready to call on striker Dwight Gayle on Sunday against Wolves in a bid to solve Newcastle's goalscoring crisis - a player the club would have happily sold in the summer.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/22/20198194-0-image-a-136_1572037720877.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
