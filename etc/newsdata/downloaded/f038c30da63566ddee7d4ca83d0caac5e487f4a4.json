Only an idiot would do that! Exactly.\u201d\n\nBut Noah said we shouldn\u2019t be surprised because Trump \u201cdoes this all the time.\u201d He said Trump \u201cis the only person who will do something so bad right out in the open that it makes you question whether it\u2019s actually bad.\u201d Noah compared it to Kanye West \u201cwalking around basically in rags, but because he does it so confidently, we\u2019re like, \u2018I guess that\u2019s a style now?\u2019\u201d\n\nLater, the host went off on Fox News commentators and Republican lawmakers alike for blindly defending Trump\u2019s actions. \u201cIf you\u2019re on Team Trump, this transcript wasn\u2019t a disaster, it was a total win.\u201d After playing clips of Fox\u2019s Stuart Varney, Lindsey Graham and others insisting there\u2019s \u201cno explicit quid pro quo,\u201d Noah said, \u201clet\u2019s be honest, you don\u2019t need to be explicit to set up a shady deal.\u201d", "description": "\u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host thinks Trump may have made a fatal mistake when he agreed to release the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1405,w_2497,x_46,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569464969/TN_55_yericj", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
