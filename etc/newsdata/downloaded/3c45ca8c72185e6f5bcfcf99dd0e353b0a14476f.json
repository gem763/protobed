Now, does anyone remember what net neutrality was?\n\nPresident Donald Trump hailed the DC appeals court\u2019s decision to uphold the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s 2017 move to axe net neutrality as \u201ca great win for the future and speed of the internet\u201d that will \u201clead to many big things, including 5G\u201d in a tweet on Monday. But what is net neutrality, exactly, and why does anyone care?\n\nAlso on rt.com Telecom stranglehold: 2020 candidates vow greater web access, but corporate lobbies stand in the way\n\nPut simply, without net neutrality, your internet service provider can throttle access to the free version of YouTube, pushing an \u201cupgrade\u201d to a paid service in exchange for quicker video load speeds.\n\nThe FCC, led by a former Verizon lawyer, dropped Obama-era net neutrality rules in 2017, deregulating companies like Verizon and Comcast that provide broadband internet service. Net neutrality rules barred these companies from speeding up access for sites and customers they liked and throttling or even blocking access to sites and customers they didn\u2019t. Providers were legally blocked from manipulating internet traffic based on whether a customer or site had paid for \u2018better\u2019 service. Internet providers were held to the same rules as telephone service providers.\n\nNet neutrality\u2019s backers worried that without the rules, providers would create a two-tiered system that gave those who could pay quick and unrestricted access, while those who couldn\u2019t would be limited to sluggish internet ghettos. The rules force carriers to treat all internet traffic equally \u2013 a crucial safeguard in an industry in which many broadband providers have a monopoly or near-monopoly on customers in a certain region. Opponents of net neutrality insist that providers that act badly will merely drive their customers to competitors \u2013 forgetting that in many areas, there are no competitors.\n\nAlso on rt.com As voice after voice gets purged from social media, still think there\u2019s no censorship?\n\nThe process of repealing net neutrality rules in 2017 was tainted by malfeasance. A New York state probe found that nearly half of the public comments submitted to the FCC while they were considering rolling back net neutrality were fake \u2013 and a Stanford University study found the vast majority of the real comments were in favor of keeping net neutrality. Even the House, despite hefty donations from telecom companies, has come out in favor of net neutrality, passing a bill in April to restore the Obama-era rules.\n\nThere is a bright spot in last week\u2019s ruling, however. It allows states to pass their own net neutrality laws and prevents the FCC from interfering. California has already passed its own net neutrality law, which the Justice Department immediately pounced on and which it will be allowed to keep if the appeals court ruling remains in effect.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
