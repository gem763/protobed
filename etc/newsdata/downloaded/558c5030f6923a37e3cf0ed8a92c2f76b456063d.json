And now they are caught in the crossfire,\u201d Clinton said at a human rights awards ceremony at Georgetown University, where she spoke about the impeachment inquiry launched this week by House Democrats.\n\nSince House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the formal impeachment inquiry into Trump on Tuesday, the president has amped up his stream of invective against the anonymous whistleblower who filed a complaint against Trump over his repeated attempts to enlist Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.\n\nPrior to a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump withheld almost $400 million in U.S. military aid from his government in what some critics have described as extortion for political dirt on Biden. In the complaint stemming from Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, the unnamed whistleblower also cited conversations and details provided by \u201cmore than half a dozen U.S. officials,\u201d alleging that Trump is \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton and President Trump.

Still, Clinton said, Trump\u2019s impeachment \u201cshouldn\u2019t be a preordained conclusion.\u201d\n\nClinton lauded Pelosi\u2019s \u201cclear-eyed leadership,\u201d noting the importance of women\u2019s leadership in advancing human rights, justice and peace. She said the speaker\u2019s decision to investigate the president was based \u201con the basis of evidence that he betrayed his oath of office to uphold the Constitution and protect and defend our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow sadly we\u2019ve known who Donald Trump is for some time now,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe knew he was a corrupt businessman who cheated people. We knew that he and his campaign invited foreign adversaries to tamper with our elections. And now we know that in the course of his duties as president, he\u2019s endangered us all by putting his personal and political interests ahead of the interests of the American people.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s comments about Trump drew little audience response, whereas her remarks when she referred to Pelosi and said that foreign service officers \u201cdeserve the support and gratitude of all Americans\u201d garnered cheers.\n\n\u201cBut this is ultimately about much more than Donald Trump,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is about us. It is about who we are as a nation. History is being written, and the world and our children are watching.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accused President Trump on Friday of having \u201cturned American diplomacy into a cheap extortion racket.\u201d", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Za8a.KAwCkyMc698MQ1D9A--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/bd190820-e148-11e9-ba7f-57562a750388", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
