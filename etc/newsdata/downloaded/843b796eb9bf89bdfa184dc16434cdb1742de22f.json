The pair continued to text back and forth before agreeing to meet one-on-one.\n\nHayden said he had also been hiding his affection for the teacher for some time.\n\n'A lot of the boys at school were talking about her. She was young and really attractive so that made lessons a lot better,' he said at the time.\n\nHayden's mother Gaile said she noticed Hayden started to shower more often and groom himself before going to class.\n\nHer son also openly admitted he had Ms Miller's number in his phone.\n\nGaile's suspicions weren't confirmed until Hayden said he was getting tutoring at school with other students, when in reality he was spending time alone with the teacher.\n\nShe cottoned on to the lie when she swung by the school to pick up her son and discovered Hayden wasn't there.\n\nMs Miller is now a Year 9 dean in pastoral care at Dannevirke High School - despite initial fears she wouldn't have been allowed to work in teaching ever again\n\nFast forward 13 years and Ms Miller and Hayden are now married and raising a family - two boys and one girl\n\nLater, she insisted on reading the text messages on his phone and quickly discovered the secret relationship.\n\nRather than tell Hayden to end the relationship then and there, Gaile asked Ms Miller to come over to the house.\n\nMs Miller said as soon as she pulled her car up to the front, Hayden walked outside.\n\nHe led her into the house and the lounge room where his parents were waiting for them.\n\nAfter the lovers explained their situation, Ms Miller was given an ultimatum: end the relationship, or resign from her position at the school.\n\nWhile Gaile admitted she was shocked and believed the relationship was inappropriate, she was relieved when she learned Ms Miller was only 23 years old.\n\nWhen the English teacher made the decision to resign, Gaile said she thought it was foolish.\n\nNonetheless, she would support the couple in the decision they made.\n\nMs Miller said that as Hayden walked her back to the car the pair shared their 'first-kiss'.\n\nShe drove to the principal's house and handed in her resignation.\n\nNew Zealand teaching authority Teachers Council did not investigate Ms Miller as she was a student teacher and had not been registered teacher at the time.\n\nFast forward 13 years and Ms Miller and Hayden are now married and raising a family - two boys and one girl.\n\nMs Miller is now a Year 9 dean in pastoral care at Dannevirke High School.\n\nMs Miller drove to the principal's house and handed in her resignation\n\nHayden works as a year 10 dean at Palmerston North Boys' High and recently told Herald on Sunday he was very happy\n\nPrincipal Di Carter said Ms Miller had become a valuable asset to the school and that she was happily married.\n\n'I heard something but that was way before my time.
