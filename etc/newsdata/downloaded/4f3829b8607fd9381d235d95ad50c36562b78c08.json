That means shows like \"American Vandal,\" \"One Day at a Time,\" and more have been given the boot earlier than fans, and critics, would have hoped.\n\nThe latest Netflix critical darling to bite the dust is \"Dear White People,\" which Netflix renewed for a fourth and final season on Wednesday.

We excluded shows that are concluding with movies, such as \"Sense8\" and \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\"\n\nBelow are 11 canceled Netflix shows that critics loved:", "description": "Netflix has canceled plenty of critically acclaimed TV shows, including \"Tuca and Bertie,\" \"One Day at a Time,\" and \"American Vandal.\"", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5af9df16bd6fc218008b4ab0?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
