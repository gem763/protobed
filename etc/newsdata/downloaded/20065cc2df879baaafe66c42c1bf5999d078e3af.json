Two years earlier, Johnson had taken a tour of Northern cities to campaign against Radical Republicans in Congress and build support for his lenient policies toward the defeated South.\n\nAt first, it was a success, with large crowds cheering the president during events in Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia. But his fortunes turned in Cleveland, where the stubborn and taciturn Johnson unraveled in the face of hecklers. \u201cThe president was frequently interrupted by cheers, by hisses and by cries, apparently from those opposed to him in the crowd,\u201d William Hudson, a reporter for The Cleveland Leader, wrote. When a heckler yelled, \u201cHang Jeff Davis!\u201d \u2014 referring to the former leader of the Confederacy, then held at Fort Monroe in Virginia \u2014 Johnson replied, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hang him?\u201d When another shouted, \u201cThad Stevens\u201d \u2014 the chief Radical Republican in the House of Representatives \u2014 a now angry Johnson responded with \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hang Thad Stevens and Wendell Phillips?\u201d Phillips had been a leading abolitionist.\n\nJohnson continued to speak, struggling to gain the upper hand with the crowd. By the end, however, the president was unhinged. \u201cCome out where I can see you,\u201d he said to one heckler. \u201cIf you ever shoot a man, you will do it in the dark and pull the trigger when no one else is by to see.\u201d After witnessing this disastrous performance, an aide urged the president to consider the dignity of the office. Johnson was dismissive. \u201cI don\u2019t care about my dignity,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\nThe tour didn\u2019t improve. In St. Louis, as in Cleveland, hecklers yelled \u201cNew Orleans\u201d in reference to a massacre that summer in which white Democrats, most of them ex-Confederates, attacked a large gathering of black Republican marchers, killing nearly 50 people. In response, Johnson said the \u201criot at New Orleans was substantially planned.\u201d But he blamed Radical Republicans who, he said, encouraged the city\u2019s \u201cblack population to arm themselves and prepare for the shedding of blood.\u201d At this point, someone in the crowd called him a \u201ctraitor,\u201d which \u2014 as Garry Boulard recounts in \u201cThe Swing Around the Circle: Andrew Johnson and the Train Ride That Destroyed a Presidency\u201d \u2014 Johnson angrily denounced with one of the strangest tirades of the tour: \u201cI have been traduced! I have been slandered. I have been maligned. I have been called Judas \u2014 Judas Iscariot and all of that.\u201d\n\nBy the time it was over, Johnson had been humiliated and his reputation was in tatters. In The Atlantic Monthly, the essayist Edwin Percy Whipple summarized elite opinion of Johnson\u2019s tour :\n\nNever before did the first office in the gift of the people appear so poor an object of human ambition as when Andrew Johnson made it an eminence on which to exhibit inability to behave and incapacity to reason. His low cunning conspired with his devouring egoism to make him throw off all the restraints of official decorum, in the expectation that he would find duplicates of himself in the crowds he addressed and that mob diffused would heartily sympathize with Mob impersonated. Never was a blustering demagogue led by a distempered sense of self-importance into a more fatal error.\n\nAll of this would resurface in 1868, when the House adopted its 11 articles of impeachment against the president. Among them was a reference to his summer swing through the North \u2014 to the idea that Johnson had sullied the office of the presidency with dangerous, demagogic rhetoric. In its 10th article of impeachment, the House of Representatives accused Johnson of being \u201cunmindful of the high duties of his office and the dignity and proprieties thereof.\u201d His behavior, they argued, was an \u201cattempt to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach the Congress of the United States\u201d and to \u201cimpair and destroy the regard and respect of all the good people of the United States for the Congress and the legislative power thereof.\u201d", "description": "The House should consider the president\u2019s incendiary rhetoric as a separate offense, worthy of its own article of impeachment, as it was in 1868.", "authors": ["Jamelle Bouie"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/opinion/02bouieWeb/02bouieWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
