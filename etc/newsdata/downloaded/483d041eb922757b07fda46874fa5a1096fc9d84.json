Sadie Frost and Jude Law's painful \u00a35million divorce", "language": "en", "text": "Get the biggest celebs stories by email Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nWith their stunning looks, cherubic children, A-list mates and idyllic life, Jude Law and Sadie Frost appeared to have it all.\n\nBut their six-year marriage collapsed in a blaze of acrimony in 2003 following a string of vicious rows.\n\nTheir tumultuous union was wound up in a matter of seconds at London's High Court 16 years ago today.\n\nNeither was present for the hearing, but it would take a devastated Sadie six years to get over Jude's decision to end things.\n\nAfter all, they had enjoyed an intense, passionate romance, falling for each other on the set of 1992 Brit flick, Shopping.\n\nHe was a gangly, skint 19 year old - she was a 25-year-old mother, who'd been married to Spandau Ballet star Gary Kemp for nine years.\n\nIn her 2010 autobiography, Crazy Days, she recalled the sinking feeling that overwhelmed her as she realised, \"it was my fate to spend the rest of my life with Jude.\"\n\nShe tried to \"crush her unwelcome ideas\" about Jude, realising they were \"jeopardising an idyllic home life.\"\n\n\"The force of the love I felt for Jude and his intense ambition made me feel out of control,\" she admitted.\n\nBut their powerful attraction could not be denied, and once filming wrapped, she moved out of the family home and took a holiday to Bali with Jude, where their relationship began.\n\nAnd Jude's devotion to Sadie only broadened his appeal as his career began to fly.\n\n\"I was not the guy who got all the right girls... until I met Sadie,\" he gushed.\n\nSadie bought a house in the trendy London suburb of Primrose Hill for her and son Finlay, and Jude quickly moved in.\n\nIn 1996 she fell pregnant with their son Rafferty, but the pressure of their careers and enforced time apart were already beginning to take their toll.\n\nAnd after the birth, Sadie said her \"unease\" turned to something much darker and she self-harmed after a night of partying.\n\n\"I got home the next day racked with guilt. I was sitting at my dressing table, not feeling anything \u2013 just numb,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I watched my hand slowly pick up a pair of scissors. It was as if I was being sucked down lower into the chair and the scissors seemed to be drawn to my arm.\n\n\"I appeared to have cut myself. Blood dripped down my arm. There was no sense of panic within me \u2013 I just felt empty.\"\n\nShe was treated for severe post-natal depression, and after her recovery married Jude on a canal barge in London's Little Venice, wearing no shoes and a dress John Galliano had made for Kate Moss' 21st birthday.\n\nTheir famous pals, including Kate and best man Jonny Lee Miller, continued the celebrations in a penthouse suite at the Covent Garden Hotel. But the hedonistic lifestyle the north London set enjoyed also drove a wedge between her and Jude.\n\nAnd when daughter Iris arrived in 1998, her post-natal depression savagely returned once more.\n\n(Image: Rex Features)\n\n\"Jude tried to understand, but the more we had to socialise at grand dinner parties in Hollywood, the more I felt my self-esteem slipping away,\" Sadie wrote.\n\n\"The more I worried about my condition, the more self-obsessed I became and the less attention I gave to Jude.\"\n\nShe \"buried\" her pain by partying and socialising with the likes of Rhys Ifans, Ewan McGregor, Oasis before their son Rudy was born prematurely in 2002.\n\nBy then, the marriage was at an all-time low and a huge chasm had opened up between the Hollywood actor and his wife.\n\nThe Daily Mail falsely claimed Jude had an affair with Nicole Kidman on the set of their movie, Cold Mountain. Nicole was later awarded damages and an apology.\n\nBut the marriage continued to disintegrate and Sadie's worst fears were confirmed when she flew out to Thailand to join Jude for a family holiday in January 2003.\n\n\"Right away I knew something was wrong. I knew it was over, the way he looked at me. I was underweight, depressed and scared,\" she wrote.\n\nThen when they flew to Los Angeles for the Golden Globe Awards, the truth finally came out.\n\n\"I asked him if he loved me but he didn't need to reply - I knew the answer. The moment had arrived and I knew the relationship with the man I loved was over,\" she said.\n\n(Image: Rex)\n\nA bitter row ensued, with Sadie telling the Evening Standard, \"We had a row, a few glasses were broken... I have been self-destructive, especially when I had postnatal depression.\"\n\nHer US agent forced the heartbroken star to seek help. But when Sadie ran away in the middle of her mental health assessment, she was sectioned for 28 days.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"The psychiatric ward was as bad as I'd imagined: plastic sheets on the bed and bars on the windows,\" she recalled.\n\n\"It was obvious to me and to the staff that this was not the best place for me. Fortunately, a friend was allowed to take me to his home a week later.\"\n\nBack in England, Jude moved out of the family home and she filed for divorce seven months later in August 2003.\n\n(Image: mirror.co.uk)\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\nThese days they're on much better terms and proudly co-parent their three children, celebrating birthdays and Christmases together.\n\nJude is now married to acclaimed psychologist Phillipa Coen, while Sadie - who is now teetotal and vegan - is in a long-term relationship with Darren Strowger.", "description": "Jude Law and Sadie Frost were the It couple of the late nineties, but their marriage was torn apart by fame and depression", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Rex Features", "Rex", "Instagram", "Mirror.Co.Uk", "Getty Images Europe"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/article618712.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_43eb649c-d099-43cb-8303-6c600eb2288c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
