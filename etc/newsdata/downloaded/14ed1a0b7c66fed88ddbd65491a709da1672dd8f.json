Life would get darn uncomfortable otherwise.\n\nWhat many may not know is that Governor Andrew Cuomo and his climate-obsessed administration has been working hard to deprive utilities of the fuel they need to keep our lights on and our central heating systems operational. There were even power cuts in New York City this summer because of Cuomo's irrational aversion to fossil fuels, and one downstate utility company stopped accepting new natural gas customers because of a politically-induced shortage of that precious fuel. Similar unwise policies in Massachusetts led that state to import Russian natural gas by sea \u2014 despite the fact that the United States boasts some of the largest natural gas reserves in the world, and U.S. production is higher than ever.\n\nSo how do politicians like Governor Cuomo go about depriving Americans of power and heat? The latest trick they've employed is the weaponization of the federal Clean Water Act.\n\nIn an effort to reduce fossil fuel usage, Governor Cuomo claims that natural gas pipelines are a danger to the environment, specifically public water supplies, despite the industry\u2019s superb safety record. Never mind that trucking natural gas is less efficient, less safe, and more expensive. The purpose of the Governor\u2019s moratorium on new natural gas pipelines is to choke off the ability of utility companies to obtain the affordable energy supplies they need to keep the electricity flowing to homes and businesses, and to keep New Yorkers cool in summertime and warm in the winter. Presumably, Cuomo and his cronies assume that, once we find ourselves reading by candlelight and jogging in place to stay warm, we'll install solar panels and windmills by the millions, for lack of better options. Think of it as a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d by other means...\n\nOf course, none of this is what the Clean Water Act was designed for. New York's interpretation of the law was always bogus.\n\nFurthermore, politicians pursuing an ideological agenda hostile to fossil fuels could have appealed to voters directly to ban them, but instead decided to subvert the Clean Water Act and abuse their oversight responsibilities to force consumers to purchase more expensive \u201cgreen\u201d energy (when New Yorkers already pay through the nose).\n\nAs it happens, Cuomo and his administration were misguided from the start in their castigation of natural gas in the name of \u201csaving the planet.\u201d The fact is that rising natural gas use in the last several decades is the main factor that has allowed the U.S. to reduce its carbon footprint. The Energy Information Administration found that the transition from coal to natural gas for power generation has reduced carbon emissions by 28 percent from 2005 to 2017. No, what drives the political crusade against natural gas pipelines is not a reasonable, balanced strategy to protect the environment \u2014 it is instead a shortsighted prejudice against an energy source that is part of the solution to climate change, not part of the problem.\n\nThe good news is that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) recently intervened to impede Cuomo\u2019s moratorium. FERC ruled that New York waived its authority to block natural gas pipeline projects on the pretext that they violate the Clean Water Act because it has not resolved such disputes in a timely manner. This ruling, in combination with recent Executive Orders and EPA rule changes designed to facilitate the expansion of energy infrastructure, may effectively curtail New York politicians' vendetta against natural gas \u2014 and against the millions of New Yorkers who rely on it for power and heat.\n\nBravo, FERC! Bravo, EPA! We all support a diverse energy mix that includes renewables, but we also need power and heat \u2014 and therefore fossil fuels \u2014 to live and work in a civilized society.\n\nAmericans should make it clear to their elected officials, including Governor Cuomo, that we won't stand for unfounded political interference in the provision of basic necessities to homes and businesses. It's obvious, moreover, that we need more natural gas pipelines if our nation is to thrive.\n\nWinter is coming. With a little common sense, we can be ready for it.", "description": "Winter is coming, to borrow a phrase.\u00a0Every New Yorker knows .09/23/2019 13:19:43PM EST.", "authors": ["Nicholas Waddy", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/59/862dd0bf-31be-4756-a6bb-7ebe5ebeee7c.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
