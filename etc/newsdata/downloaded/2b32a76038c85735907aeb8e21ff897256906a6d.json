Banks have denied the charge.\n\n\u201cOver the past few years lenders have been competing for new business by offering sharp interest rates,\u201d says Steve Mickenbecker, group executive for Canstar, which compares fees and rates.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been able to do this by holding rates for existing borrowers steady, which has left this group paying higher interest rates compared to new borrowers.\u201d\n\nLenders recently came under fire for \u201cprofiteering\u201d by not passing on the whole 25 basis point cut announced earlier this month by the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\nHandy, a manager in the automotive industry, was chasing a lower rate for his new home loan of $930,000 and $570,000 investment apartment but is more interested in improved service, particularly online banking.\n\nGareth and Stephanie Handy (pictured with son Oliver) have found it time-consuming and bureaucratic to move loans. Eamon Gallagher\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just falling rates \u2013 for me, ME\u2019s service was not great. We were always having to jump through hoops to get anything done. It put us off,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI was bitter about ME from the start. The service was slow, the online applications took an eternity to load and were not efficiently delivered.\u201d\n\nFor example, he received a fine after the bank incorrectly calculated the monthly payment on the combined mortgages was 2\u00a2 short.\n\nBut the planned move to ANZ highlights the time, expense and bureaucracy that can entangle even a comparatively simple process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHandy has so far incurred expenses of a $350 discharge fee to ME Bank, $240 in state registry taxes and $395 in fees for the ANZ loan package.\n\nThe transfer, which was meant to be settled on Monday, has been put back a fortnight because one of the letters from his middle name was missing on the loan documents. That is likely to cost another $92 in lost interest payments. \u201cIt is completely unacceptable,\u201d he says.\n\nME\u2019s chief experience efficer Ingrid Purcell replies: \u201cWe\u2019re always sorry to hear a customer is leaving. However, ME continues to invest in its digital experiences and overall customer satisfaction is very high, with recent Roy Morgan data showing ME in the top four for non-home-loan customers and top five for home loan customers. Historically, ME has a net gain in refinancers, particularly from the big four, as more customers realise they can get a better deal from mid-tier banks and a better customer experience.\u201d\n\nCate Bakos, president of the Real Estate Buyers Agents Association of Australia, says borrowers can encourage existing lenders to \u201csharpen their pencil\u201d and offer a more competitive rate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like buying something from Bunnings Warehouse,\u201d says Bakos about the retailer that promises to better any price offered by a competitor. \u201cThey want to keep your business and will often come back with a matching, or better, offer.\u201d\n\nFor borrowers like the Handys, who want to change lender for a range of reasons, there is the option of a loan package or a stand-alone loan.\n\nThe accompanying tables highlights the differences in rates charged to existing and new customers for loan packages from seven lenders. It assumes the existing customers started their loans three years ago.\n\nCBA, ANZ and NAB have not offered bigger discounts to new borrowers for these products, but there may be discrepancies in rates for new borrowers across their other home loans.\n\nOthers, such as Suncorp Bank, have sliced nearly 180 basis points off the package rate for new borrowers compared to 115 basis points paid by existing borrowers. The saving for new borrowers is almost $400 a month.\n\nThe discounts are even bigger for the investment loans, with HSBC offering a 200 basis point discount (compared with 80 basis points for existing borrowers), meaning a saving of almost $700 a month or nearly $251,000 over the life of the loan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also savings for borrowers ready to forfeit some of the features by opting for a \"basic package\", which is also shown in another table.\n\nBuyers ready to shop around non-banks, mutuals and co-ops are likely to find even cheaper rates, particularly special offers targeting first-time buyers, or those planning to switch.\n\n\u201cEven basic loans usually allow extra repayments and redraw so that borrowers are not giving up too much and can still achieve a competitive interest rate,\u201d says Mickenbecker.\n\nBorrowers switching loans are also being offered low or no fees, cash to cover legal costs, air miles or home appliances.\n\nChris Foster-Ramsay, a mortgage broker, says many smaller lenders make market-beating one-off special offers but are reluctant to renegotiate in later years when rates begin to creep up.\n\nBig lenders are more likely to offer their package loan borrowers a better deal, he adds.\n\nBorrowers considering a new loan face tougher credit scrutiny after the introduction of comprehensive credit reporting on October 1 that enables lenders to access more information from credit rating agencies.\n\nThose with good overall credit could get a lower rate but others can be charged a premium or find it more difficult to obtain credit.\n\nMortgage brokers recommend those applying for a loan to regularly review their credit report, pay bills on time, pay the credit card off in full each month and consider consolidating debt.\n\nThey also recommend setting up a file that contains 12 months\u2019 bank statements and three to six months\u2019 payslips.\n\nFinder, which monitors market rates and fees, warns against applying for loans with a variety of lenders. \u201cEach time you apply for credit, an inquiry is made on your credit file. Too many inquiries can have a negative impact on your credit,\u201d it says.", "description": "Your lender is relying on you feeling it's too hard to move your mortgage.
