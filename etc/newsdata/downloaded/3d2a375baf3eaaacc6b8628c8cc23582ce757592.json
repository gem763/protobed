Only this time, Marco Silva is the man under the spotlight. Five defeats in their last six Premier League games leaves the Toffees 16th in the table, two points above the relegation zone.\n\nWith a fourth-round Carabao Cup tie against Watford looming on Tuesday night, could Silva's former employers, who still haven't' forgotten the controversial manner of his departure, deepen the dagger and trigger the end of the road for Silva on Merseyside?\n\nMarco Silva is under pressure as Everton manager following a discouraging start to the season\n\nSummer signings, such as Alex Iwobi (pictured), are yet to fully impress at Goodison Park\n\nIt would be the ultimate case of sporting karma, especially in the eyes of unforgiving Watford supporters. Silva's acrimonious sacking in January 2018 essentially boiled down to Everton's pursuit, or 'tapping-up', of the Portuguese manager.\n\nAfter a strong start in 2017-18 with the Hornets, Silva was Everton's number one pick to replace Koeman. Watford however, would not even entertain the idea and the message was clear: leave our man alone.\n\nBut for Silva himself, the future was not so uncomplicated. Unquestionably swayed by what he saw as a step-up in managerial opportunity, Watford's form dipped around the festive period, with many around the club pointing the finger directly at the 41-year-old for making no attempt to quash rumours of a move up north.\n\nThe end seemed nigh and low and behold Silva was gone by mid-January, a Watford statement citing the reasoning: 'That unwarranted approach, something which the Board believes has seen a significant deterioration in both focus and results, to the point where the long-term future of Watford FC has been jeopardised.'\n\nSilva left Watford in January 2018 after becoming 'distracted' at Everton rumours swirling\n\nFans brought toy snakes and a banner aimed at their former boss last season to Goodison Park\n\nThat 'unwarranted approach' was of course from Everton. And so a long-legal battle ensued between the two clubs - Everton eventually coughed up \u00a34million to Watford in compensation.\n\nThe terraces never forget though. At Goodison Park last season, Watford supporters brandished toy snakes in the away section, alongside a banner reading the name of Marco Silva but with the 'S' replaced with the reptile.\n\nMARCO SILVA AT EVERTON Days in charge: 515 Matches: 55\n\n55 Wins: 23\n\n23 Draws: 10\n\n10 Losses: 22\n\n22 Goals scored: 82\n\n82 Goals conceded: 74 Statistics according to Transfermarkt\n\nFast-forward to this season, and both clubs are on the ropes.\n\nWatford have already dispensed with Javi Gracia, ungracefully removing him after four games despite a run to the FA Cup final last season. His replacement, Quique Sanchez Flores, is so far not faring any better in his second reign at the club than in his first three years ago.\n\nAt Everton, where expectations are understandably higher and supporters are more desperate than ever for success and as they live in the shadow of their flourishing neighbours across Stanley Park, patience is wearing thin.\n\nSilva was bold in the summer, spending \u00a320million-plus each each on Alex Iwobi, Moise Kean, Andre Gomes and Jean-Philippe Gbamin. Fabian Delph was also signed for a cut-price \u00a38.5m.\n\nThus far, none of those signings have wowed onlookers. Whilst Kean could be excused given his acclimatisation to a new country and new league and Gbamin has battled injury, Iwobi has been wasteful in front of goal, particularly in the 1-0 defeat against Burnley.\n\nAndre Gomes (L) and Michael Keane are disconsolate after Brighton's late winner on Saturday\n\nCARABAO CUP, ROUND FOUR Tuesday Burton Albion vs Leicester City\n\nCrawley Town vs Colchester Utd\n\nEverton vs Watford\n\nManchester City vs Southampton\n\nOxford Utd vs Sunderland Wednesday Aston Villa vs Wolves\n\nChelsea vs Manchester United\n\nLiverpool vs Arsenal\n\nEven central playmaker Gomes, who was the modicum of calm and composed whilst on-loan at the Toffees last season from Barcelona, has not exerted the same influence in the opening two months.\n\nWhile Leicester and even Crystal Palace are enjoying the high-life in the top-half of the Premier League, Everton have recorded six defeats from 10 games, including worrying losses to newly-promoted Sheffield United and Aston Villa.\n\nAll of which makes Tuesday's match at Goodison Park much more important than your run-of-the-mill League Cup tie.\n\nAlthough Silva will undoubtedly be judged on his league form instead of results in England's secondary club competition, another insipid performance in front of the home faithful could plant the seed for a change come the mid-November international break.\n\nIn fact, forget the performance. Anything but quarter-final progression could spell the end for Silva in his sixth managerial stint. It'll certainly be a stark marker if Everton cannot beat a team even more short on confidence than themselves.\n\nTuesday's contest is the first of three crucial matches for Silva before the international break\n\nWith games against out-of-form Tottenham and cataclysmic Southampton to follow, it is now fight or flight for Marco Silva at Goodison.\n\nYet for Watford, should they knock out Everton, they could safely say 'what goes round comes around' to their former boss.\n\nOwing to something of a catastrophic start themselves, handing the final blow to Silva's time at Everton would undoubtedly be the highlight of their season so far.", "description": "KIERAN JACKSON: Anything but quarter-final progression on Tuesday night could spell the end.
