The deadline for compliance is October 15.\n\nTrump \u201cjeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding military assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression,\u201d the chairs of the committees said Monday.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018This is war\u2019: Trump\u2019s critics & backers trade blows as Washington braces for impeachment showdown\n\nAdam Schiff (D-California), Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland) and Eliot Engel (D-New York) cited press reports to claim Trump\u2019s decision was intended to pressure Kiev into opening a probe of Democrat presidential front-runner Joe Biden. They first made that claim last month, citing a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint about the call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from July.\n\nBiden\u2019s son Hunter had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company for years, without any qualifications other than his family name, while his father was the Obama administration\u2019s point man on Ukraine policy.\n\nTrump has released the transcript of the call with Zelensky, showing he had not brought up the aid \u2013 and it has subsequently emerged that Kiev did not even know the money was being held up at the time.\n\nDemocrats have already tried to subpoena the State Department, the White House and Vice President Mike Pence as part of the impeachment inquiry, but their demands have been rebuffed as a proper probe requires a floor vote in the House \u2013 which was never taken.\n\nAlso on rt.com Dems fishing for State Dept leakers?
