The proposed regulation could harm hundreds of thousands of people held at immigration detention centers around the country, as reported by The New York Times.\n\nThe administration is framing the plan as an expansion of a pilot program they ran this summer along the US-Mexico border. There, immigration officials used Rapid DNA technology, which processes DNA samples in about 90 minutes, on people suspected of posing as families in order to avoid long detention stays (children can\u2019t be held for more than 20 days). This is particularly troubling as not all families are genetically related \u2014 adoption, for instance, exists.\n\nNot all families are genetically related \u2014 adoption, for instance, exists\n\nThe database where that DNA will be stored primarily contains information about people who\u2019ve committed serious offenses. The New York Times noted that on the FBI\u2019s website, it\u2019s described as a \u201ctool for linking violent crimes.\u201d It\u2019s one more step in the Trump Administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on immigration and criminalize those who enter the country illegally \u2014 even if they\u2019re seeking asylum.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that American citizens will be forced to take DNA tests. This summer, border agents wrongfully arrested an 18-year-old US citizen and held him in detention for over a month.\n\n\u201cForced DNA collection raises serious privacy and civil liberties concerns and lacks justification, especially when DHS is already using less intrusive identification methods like fingerprinting,\u201d said Vera Eidelman, staff attorney with the ACLU\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, in a statement emailed to The Verge. \u201cThis kind of mass collection also alters the purpose of DNA collection from one of criminal investigation to population surveillance, which is contrary to our basic notions of freedom and autonomy.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, when Trump rolled out his \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that resulted in 2,000 kids being separated from their parents at the border, DNA testing companies offered to help. Both 23andMe and MyHeritage said they would donate DNA testing kits to help parents find their missing kids. These tests would have been voluntary, but they still presented privacy risks.\n\nDNA is genetic information, and can speak to how likely it is a person may get certain diseases, as well as who their family members are. This is valuable information for insurance companies who need to calculate the cost of someone\u2019s healthcare. It can also be used to discriminate against people applying for jobs, mortgages, or loans if they\u2019re seem as too high-risk.\n\nThe new tests contain a much broader genetic profile than what\u2019s previously been collected\n\n\u201cWhat if the government used the genetic information it collects to determine access to employment, our ability to have kids or get married, and other benefits, particularly as technology develops and our genetic information purportedly reveals even more about us?\u201d Eidelman said. \u201cWe should hope that these are unlikely hypotheticals, but they\u2019re not far-fetched considering the government\u2019s long history of engaging in wrongful behavior towards people based on their genetic composition.\u201d\n\nThe new tests are seen as problematic for this very reason: they contain a much broader genetic profile than what\u2019s been previously collected. And unlike the pilot this summer, the information will go straight to the FBI.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security told The New York Times that the new regulations are authorized under the DNA Fingerprint Act; until now, immigrants have been exempted from this unless they\u2019ve committed a crime.", "description": "People held at detention centers will now have their genetic information entered into a criminal database.
