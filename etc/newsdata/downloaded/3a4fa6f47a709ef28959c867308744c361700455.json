Up until recently, Japanese brands like Asahi, Kirin, and Sapporo were popular choices, but tastes are changing amid rising tensions between the neighbouring countries.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, South Korea imported $78.3 million worth of Japanese beer last year. But there\u2019s been a drop this year. In August, only $223,000 worth of Japanese beer made it to South Korea. This is a 97 percent drop from the $7.57 million recorded at the same time last year. In July, the drop was recorded at 94.9 percent compared to last year.\n\nKorean supermarkets and convenience stores have stopped selling Japanese beer and haven\u2019t placed more orders since August, Reuters reported. This is part of a larger boycott on popular Japanese products like ramen and seasoning sauces brought by a trade war between the two countries.\n\nIt started in July when Japan announced that it would tighten control over materials that are fundamental to the production of semiconductors in Korea. This affects the production of South Korean tech giants such as Samsung.\n\nOn August 2, Japan also removed South Korea from its \u201cwhite list,\u201d which gave the latter preferential treatment when it comes to trade.\n\nThis is an extension of an age-old conflict that dates back to the Japanese occupation of Korea during World War 2, a time Koreans associate with violence and oppression.\n\nThis spells trouble for Japanese beer companies. Asahi Group Holdings, for example, said in early August that their profits have taken a hit. They\u2019ve even lowered their forecast for this year\u2019s profits. This could prove to be beneficial for rival beer companies, including those that manufacture Korean brands like Hite.\n\n\n\nFind Meera on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "Koreans are boycotting popular Japanese products like beer, ramen, and seasoning sauces.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6f585b4133b00008d4917f/lede/1567578255589-4775193402_66bffcdbeb_o.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.84xh;0xw,0.0468xh&resize=1200:*"}
