(AP) - For the second straight season, an abysmal start has made the playoffs a distant dream for the Atlanta Falcons even before the midpoint of the season.\n\nThat\u2019s bad news for coach Dan Quinn, who may have difficulty saving his job if he can\u2019t find a way to avoid a second straight losing season.\n\nQuinn\u2019s Falcons (1-5) bring a four-game losing streak into Sunday\u2019s game against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say you shouldn\u2019t be where you are,\u201d Quinn said Wednesday. \u201cThis is where we are. I would say you\u2019re frustrated but you want to do something about it. \u2026 It\u2019s certainly my job to fix the issues that come up.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons gave up a combined 87 points in losses at Houston and Arizona the past two weeks. That\u2019s especially ominous for Quinn, who this season took over control of the defense.\n\nThe Falcons have two straight home games against the Rams and Seattle before their bye week.\n\nCornerback Ricardo Allen smiled when asked if Quinn has shown signs of feeling pressure.\n\n\u201cCoach Quinn is an OG,\u201d Allen said.\n\nQuinn? Original gangster?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like one of the best because he hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWinning coach Quinn and coach Quinn with the losses, he\u2019s still the same man. He still tries to put as much positivity into his team. He still tries to be the guy to make sure we\u2019re doing things the right way.\u201d\n\nAllen said Quinn \u201cis not the guy who bears down and yells. \u2026 That\u2019s even tough for me to watch from the sideline because I\u2019m like man, I want to be cussing people out.\u201d\n\nQuarterback Matt Ryan said Quinn \u201chas been awesome\u201d because \u201che\u2019s so consistent day in and day out.\n\n\u201cHis message is always different. It\u2019s fresh and it hits home to where we\u2019re at as a team and he\u2019s done that the entire time \u2026 he\u2019s been here.\u201d\n\nQuinn is 37-33 in five seasons. He fired all three coordinators after last season while taking on the role of defensive coordinator.\n\nSecondary coach Jerome Henderson, in his fourth season in Atlanta, said Quinn \u201cstill remains positive and energetic and wants to make sure we\u2019re giving our guys 1,000 percent of ourselves and our energy \u2026 despite the circumstance.\u201d\n\nQuinn\u2019s defense has allowed 31 points per game to rank last in the league. Atlanta is tied with Miami for last in the league with only five sacks - none in the past three games.\n\nThe losses and defensive woes are troubling for a coach who in 2016 led Atlanta to the Super Bowl and in 2017 added another playoff win.\n\nThe back-to-back winning seasons made Quinn and general manager Thomas Dimitroff look like a winning leadership team that could produce long-term success.\n\nNow, Falcons owner Arthur Blank may have to decide if leadership changes are necessary to put the team back on a winning course.\n\nLast season, a rash of injuries earned much of the blame when a 1-4 start led to a 7-9 finish.\n\nThe defense again lost safety Keanu Neal to a season-ending injury last month, but the Falcons have come up with new ways to lose. Last week\u2019s 34-33 loss to the Cardinals was capped by Matt Bryant\u2019s missed extra point which would have tied the game.\n\nQuinn says the team\u2019s misfortunes \u201care maddening and I don\u2019t have a good reason for why.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes the ball will bounce your way and you go \u2018That was cool,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe other times you\u2019ve got to be - fill in the blank.\u201d\n\nAllen said Quinn remains unwavering those \u201cother times.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Q,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThat\u2019s how he\u2019s always been. He\u2019s steady. He\u2019s the same dude, winning and losing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For the second straight season, an abysmal start has made the playoffs a distant dream for the Atlanta Falcons even before the midpoint of the season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Charles Odum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/falcons_quinn_crisis_football_32953_c0-142-3405-2128_s1200x700.jpg?9947795f26552067ea6538973af49083009da546", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
