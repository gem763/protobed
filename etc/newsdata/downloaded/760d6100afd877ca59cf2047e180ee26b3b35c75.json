The documentary focuses on the star\u2019s relationship with her third husband, film producer Sid Luft, and what Kijak considers to be the \u201cgreat second act\u201d of her career that coincided with that 13-year marriage.\n\n(Check out the trailer for \u201cSid & Judy\u201d above.)\n\nEven for seasoned fans, \u201cSid & Judy\u201d is a compelling treat, comprising colorful footage and photos of Garland on stage and at home, as well as recorded phone conversations between Luft and Hollywood executives.\n\nTo fill in gaps, Kijak uses audio recordings Garland made in the 1960s for an unpublished autobiography. In a surprisingly effective move, actors Jon Hamm and Jennifer Jason Leigh also read excerpts from Luft\u2019s posthumous 2017 memoir, \u201cJudy and I: My Life with Judy Garland,\u201d in character voiceovers as Luft and Garland, respectively.\n\nCourtesy of SHOWTIME Stephen Kijak\u2019s new documentary, \u201cSid & Judy,\u201d explores Judy Garland's marriage to producer Sid Luft and career renaissance as a live concert act.\n\nLuft was the longest-lasting of Garland\u2019s five husbands and, by many accounts, their marriage was her most turbulent. Historically, he\u2019s been credited with reviving his then-wife\u2019s stage and screen career, while squandering her earnings and continuing to enable the drug addiction that took her life in 1969. In the film, there are a number of especially dark moments, including a recording of Garland personally recalling a suicide attempt, and Luft describing how Garland accidentally set their home on fire.\n\nKijak, however, isn\u2019t interested in tabloid-level exploitation. Instead, he sees his film as capturing the \u201creal connection\u201d between Luft, who died in 2005, and Garland that was \u201cdeeply passionate and very volatile.\u201d\n\nHis feelings shifted, however, once he began his research and delved into episodes of \u201cThe Judy Garland Show,\u201d the 1963 musical variety series featuring Garland performing alongside Tony Bennett, Peggy Lee and, most famously, Streisand.\n\nCourtesy of SHOWTIME Luft (right) and Garland were married for 13 years and had two children, Lorna and Joey.\n\n\u201cThe lightbulb moment, honestly, was seeing Judy sing \u2018Come Rain or Come Shine,\u2019 a clip of which is in the film,\u201d Kijak said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a volcanic performance. I just thought, \u2018Holy shit, what have I been missing?\u2019 She\u2019s jazzy as hell, she swings hard \u2015 I love the intensity and power of it. There was a great sense of revelation in discovering it.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, \u201cSid & Judy\u201d is a portrait of Garland a few years before the events seen in \u201cJudy,\u201d the big-screen biopic starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger that\u2019s now in theaters. The documentary starts at the onset of Luft\u2019s affair with Garland, who was then still married to director Vincente Minnelli, in 1950.\n\nGarland\u2019s career was, by then, at a crossroads following the termination of her contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. With Luft acting as her manager, she\u2019s reborn as a touring concert act, and later returns to the big screen in 1954\u2019s \u201cA Star is Born,\u201d for which she nabbed an Oscar nomination. Together, the couple have two children, Lorna and Joey Luft.\n\nWhile \u201cSid & Judy\u201d portrays Luft more empathetically than many books and films about Garland \u2015 including \u201cJudy\u201d \u2015 Kijak stressed that he didn\u2019t set out to \u201crehabilitate\u201d the producer\u2019s image in any way.\n\nBettmann via Getty Images Kijak sees his film as capturing the \u201cdeeply passionate and very volatile\u201d relationship between Luft (right) and Garland.\n\nAnd while Garland\u2019s substance abuse is central to Kijak\u2019s narrative, the filmmaker would like viewers to come away from \u201cSid & Judy\u201d with a better understanding of the pressures the star was up against, too.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of work about Judy, there tends to be this sort of pathologizing of her,\u201d Kijak said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the pity, the whole tragic complex, which is so well-worn by now. But to hear it firsthand ... brings you closer to the story. The machine of recovery we have today wasn\u2019t available to her. That\u2019s the real tragedy.\u201d\n\nKijak sees the release of \u201cSid & Judy\u201d on the heels of the movie \u201cJudy\u201d as a happy coincidence. That biopic, which premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival in September, has earned Zellweger critical accolades and early Oscars buzz. A number of dissenting opinions, however, have emerged in recent weeks.\n\nAt the time of his HuffPost interview, Kijak had yet to catch \u201cJudy,\u201d though he said he was looking forward to seeing Zellweger\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic moment for Judy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see the feature, you can dig a little deeper and get into our film. They\u2019re two very different things, but both are full of her great music and performances.\u201d\n\n\u201cSid & Judy\u201d premieres Oct. 18 on Showtime.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS \u201cThe machine of recovery we have today wasn\u2019t available to her,\u201d said Kijak of Garland (right), shown here with Luft in 1956. \u201cThat\u2019s the real tragedy.\u201d", "description": "Stephen Kijak's documentary traces the \"Wizard of Oz\" star's marriage to third husband, Sid Luft, and features Jon Hamm and Jennifer Jason Leigh.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8d1a921e00002f00739e48.jpeg?cache=uaiorbfee6&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
