It was my idea and it was my idea to terminate it. I didn't even discuss it with anyone else,\" Mr Trump said as he departed the White House for a political rally in North Carolina.\n\n\"I cancelled Camp David on the basis that they did something that they sure as hell shouldn't have done,\" he said, condemning the attack that killed 12 people, including the US soldier.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tens of thousands of Afghan soldiers have been killed and injured. This is their story\n\nMr Trump has been criticised for entertaining the possibility of hosting the Taliban just days before the anniversary of the 11 September attacks.\n\nBut Mr Trump defended the idea, saying \"having meetings is a good thing, not a bad thing\".\n\nThe Taliban had never agreed to end their violent campaign against Afghan and foreign forces while negotiations were taking place. Sixteen US troops have been killed this year.\n\nIn 2001, US-led forces overthrew the Taliban government in Afghanistan because the militants had given safe haven to the al-Qaeda network to plan the attacks on the US on 11 September.\n\nHow far did the talks get?\n\nIn a statement, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said the talks were going well until Saturday.\n\nPulling out of the peace process before the signing of the agreement - because of one explosion - showed the US's lack of maturity and experience, he added.\n\nThe proposed meeting in the US came after nine rounds of talks between the US and Taliban representatives, held in Doha, the capital of the Gulf state of Qatar.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Is peace with the Taliban possible?\n\nOn Monday, the top US negotiator said there was a peace deal \"in principle\".\n\nAs part of the proposal the US would have withdrawn 5,400 troops within 20 weeks, in return for Taliban guarantees that Afghanistan would never again be used as a base for terrorism.\n\nThe Taliban is now in control of more territory than at any point before the 2001 US-led invasion. They have refused to hold direct talks with the Afghan government until a timetable for US troop withdrawals is finalised.", "description": "His comments come after he cancelled secret talks as a deal with the Taliban seemed near.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mx2ny.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
