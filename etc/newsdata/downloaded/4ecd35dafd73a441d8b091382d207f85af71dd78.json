They\u2019re present, and they\u2019re working for their national interests in ways that are 100 percent counter to the longterm stability in the region,\u201d Adm. Craig S. Faller, commander of the Pentagon\u2019s U.S. Southern Command, told reporters at a breakfast meeting in Washington.\n\nRussia is trying to \u201chang on\u201d to some of the traditional alliances it had in the region before the break up of the Soviet Union, Adm. Faller said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced Russia is out to make the United States look bad at every turn,\u201d he said.\n\nMoscow has set up a military training base in Nicaragua and is helping to prop up the regime of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, including providing technical support for Caracas\u2019 Russian-made combat aircraft, Adm. Faller said.\n\nHis comments came a few months after a July announcement by Pentagon officials that one of those Russian-maintained Venezuelan fighters \u2014 an SU-30 Flanker \u2014 had \u201caggressively shadowed\u201d a U.S. Navy EP-3 Aries II reconnaissance aircraft flying in international airspace.\n\n\u201cThe Venezuelan pilot was very unsafe, very unprofessional [and] flew at a very close distance,\u201d Adm. Faller said on Friday. \u201cWe reported that before they had a chance to spin it in a way that was not accurate.\u201d\n\nRussia has separately deployed nuclear-capable bombers and its most advanced warships, able to fire nuclear cruise missiles, in the region over the past year.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of Russian contractors and forces in Venezuela as we speak,\u201d Adm. Faller said.\n\nChina, meanwhile, has what Adm. Faller characterized as \u201clegitimate economic interests\u201d in the region, although Beijing is also increasing its military footprint to include constructing military training centers and providing weapons.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also just \u2018gifting\u2019 gear to various countries,\u201d Adm. Faller said.\n\nThe United States is continuing to work alongside countries in the region to preserve long-term stability and counter the malign influence of Russia and China, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our shared neighborhood,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what the future is going to be \u2014 working together.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
