Republicans gleefully painted the field as a bunch of out-of-touch elites: In one video, the Republic National Committee shared brief clips from the candidates, including Joe Biden, appearing to advocate a shutdown of coal-burning plants and taking gas-burning vehicles off the road \u201cas rapidly as we can.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe message: There are no moderates running for the nomination.\n\nAndrew Yang, in the same web ad, said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be OK if the vast majority of the world goes vegetarian immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t even know what to do with \u2018Burgergate,\u2019\u201d said Colin Strother, a veteran Democratic strategist from the cattle-rearing state of Texas. \u201cIt is such a fringe position that is out of step with an overwhelming majority of Americans \u2014 and let us not forget that a pretty wide swath of the country including Texas and the \u2018Breadbasket\u2019 are major beef producers.\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d Strother added, \u201cthe earliest primary state of Iowa sold almost a half a billion bushels of corn specifically to feed livestock last year. We have so many very serious issues facing our country that I struggle to understand how burgers even make the top-20 list.\u201d\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know.

And, amid calling for prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing and offshore drilling, the California senator also came out for a ban on plastic straws, even as she acknowledged the inferiority of paper straws.\n\nBernie Sanders similarly waded into fraught territory with his riff on the spiraling world population. He was asked by a teacher from New Milford, Conn., whether he\u2019d be \u201ccourageous enough\u201d to make the politically \u201cpoisonous topic\u201d of population control a key feature of his plan to address climate change. \u201cYes,\u201d Sanders replied.\n\n\u201cAnd the answer has everything to do with the fact that women in the United States of America, by the way, have a right to control their own bodies and make reproductive decisions,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I think, especially in poor countries around the world where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies, and where they can have the opportunity through birth control to control the number of kids they have, it\u2019s something I very, very strongly support.\u201d\n\nTodd Carmichael, chief executive of coffee company La Colombe, said he stopped offering straws and uses biodegradable plastic cups as a response to customer demands, not because he thought it would end global climate change. After making the change, his 10-year-old daughter reminded him that the problem is way bigger than straws.\n\n\u201cTaking the straws off the bar was a little like cleaning the windows during a hurricane,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a false lead, and we can\u2019t take our eye off the ball that is the oil and gas companies.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren has managed better than others in wiggling out of the established framing by connecting it back to her own message. Still, her answers left Republicans with enough fodder to serve their own narrative, fueling the argument of some on the left that it doesn\u2019t matter what Democrats say\u2014they\u2019ll all be painted as socialists, regardless.\n\nWarren, asked about the Trump administration\u2019s announced rollback of certain energy-saving light bulbs, and whether it imposed on Americans\u2019 freedoms, seemed exasperated by the question: \u201cOh, come on, give me a break.\u201d\n\nYet, she went on to explain that there are a lot of ways to change America\u2019s energy consumption: \u201cSome of it is with light bulbs, some of it is on straws, some of it, dang, is on cheeseburgers, right?\u201d Warren said.\n\nShe then cut to a central theme of her candidacy: That this is all part of a distraction propagated by fossil fuel companies, which are pushing to stir up controversy around light bulbs, straws and cheeseburgers when the vast majority of carbon pollution comes from just three industries.\n\n\u201cI actually agree with Elizabeth Warren,\u201d said former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a big Biden supporter, identifying the second half of her answer. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be talking about banning hamburgers and plastic straws because it just gives the Republicans something to latch onto to avoid confronting one of the harshest realities we face as a nation and as a world.\u201d\n\nStill, Rendell, a self-described \u201cdevoted meat-eater,\u201d said Democrats did Republicans a favor by handing them new material.\n\nIndeed, some fell into the trap, said RL Miller, political director of Climate Hawks Vote and president of a related political action committee, mentioning Harris\u2019 answers to CNN. \u201cThe issue is not straws. The issue is the oil companies creating systems that need to be dismantled.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m so over paper straws. #LiberalProgress\n\n\n\nThis is exactly what they would do to the economy as well. Squeeze it until it doesn\u2019t work. pic.twitter.com/zKfiZiSHV5 \u2014 Brad Parscale (@parscale) July 18, 2019\n\nEven before the town halls, Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and outside allies were weaponizing various daily inconveniences into arguments against making small sacrifices environmentalists believe are needed to help save the planet. The president\u2019s campaign this summer unveiled laser-engraved plastic \u201cTRUMP\u201d straws ($15 for a 10-pack). Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale complained about the ineffectiveness of recyclable paper straws.\n\nOn the heels of the Green New Deal, the sweeping set of environmental goals supported by many in the 2020 field, former White House official Sebastian Gorka centered his CPAC speech around the idea that Democrats want to take away Americans\u2019 pickup trucks and burgers and rebuild their homes.\n\n\u201cThe whole straw-burger debate reminds me of Sheryl Crow telling Americans to reuse toilet paper,\u201d said Bryan Lanza, a former Trump campaign official. \u201cIt didn\u2019t pass the smell test.\u201d\n\nMiller, a Democratic official who lives in Southern California, acknowledged the cultural sensitivity, particularly around meat, even as she pushed back on the premise that any of the candidates want to \u201cban\u201d burgers. On a trip to Texas, Miller said she was struck by the T-shirts at Rudy\u2019s \u201cCountry Store,\u201d a barbecue joint. On the back, it says, \u201cI didn\u2019t claw my way to the top of the food chain \u2026 to eat vegetables.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, boy, my California friends should come to Texas,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like, you need to listen to people respectfully.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina state Sen. Dick Harpootlian, the former state party chair who backed Sanders in 2016 and is now with Biden, also said Democrats seem to be botching their messaging on the environment.\n\nHarpootlian joked in a text message that he couldn\u2019t answer the phone cause his mouth was full of barbecue hog while he indulged on a glass of sweet tea \u201cthough an environmentally friendly paper straw.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout as PC as I get.\u201d", "description": "2020 presidential hopefuls fall for the GOP's culture war trap.", "authors": ["Christopher Cadelago", "Holly Otterbein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/66/16/88b2d70d419dbc8d862c7c526e64/20190906-trump-smirks-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
