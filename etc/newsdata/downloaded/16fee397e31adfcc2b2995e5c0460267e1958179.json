Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the other members of their self-styled \u201cSquad\u201d during an interview Friday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how that \u2018Squad\u2019 thing actually happened. I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re calling a bunch of freshmen some kind of entity of influence in a system they just got into,\u201d Mr. Cuomo told HBO host and comedian Bill Maher.\n\n\u201cThey have a lot of social media influence, they have political cache, the media loves to talk about them. But I think you have to put points on the board if you\u2019re going to earn your office. Get things done for your constituents, not just for your own profile,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said during an appearance on the comic\u2019s show, \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher.\u201d\n\nThe Squad\u2019s members \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014have together and separately received a considerable amount of attention in the less than a year since being elected to Congress.\n\nPresident Trump has regularly targeted The Squad since its members took office, frequently taking aim at their progressive policies and trying to depict them as the \u201cnew face\u201d of the Democratic Party, at times using Twitter to help highlight intra-party conflicts between them and established party leaders such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernard Sanders has recently secured endorsements from several members of The Squad, meanwhile, with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez stumping for the Vermont independent during a massive campaign rally last weekend in her hometown of Queens. Ms. Tlaib is scheduled to hold a rally with Mr. Sanders this Sunday, while Ms. Omar recently announced plans to participate in a Sanders event scheduled for the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis next month.\n\nMr. Cuomo, 49, is the brother of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and the son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, both Democrats. He cut his teeth at Fox News prior to joining CNN in 2013, where he currently hosts \u201cCuomo Prime Time\u201d live on weeknights.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
