She also counted on her loyalty netting her a monthly pension check. \u201cWe would get letters each year saying how much money you would get,\u201d Aikens-English said.\n\nAD\n\nSt. Clare\u2019s closed in 2008 with another hospital taking over its facilities and absorbing a lot of its employees. Although the new hospital refused to take on the obligation of the underfunded pension, the former St. Clare\u2019s employees believed the pension was solvent. Then the letters started to come informing plan participants that their pension was in peril.\n\nAD\n\nLast year, about 1,100 employees \u2014 nurses, orderlies, laboratory technicians, clerks and housekeeping staff \u2014 were told that they either would not get a pension or it would be greatly reduced. About 440 older workers and retirees who met an age cutoff saw their checks cut by 30 percent.\n\nAikens-English, who had planned to retire next year, elected to collect her pension early at 62. But she ended up receiving only two years\u2019 worth of a reduced pension check of $1,000 before they stopped.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been cheated out of some peace of mind,\u201d she said.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a pension, or if yours is solvent, you might wonder why you should care about the folks who worked at St. Clare\u2019s. Here\u2019s why.\n\nWith each federal budget season, we are reminded of the ballooning costs of taking care of people who don\u2019t have the financial resources to take care of themselves. Every pension that is shut down or in financial trouble becomes our nation\u2019s collective problem.\n\nAD\n\nIn the case of St. Clare\u2019s, some people have had to sell their homes because they can\u2019t afford them any longer, according to Victoria Esposito, advocacy coordinator for the Legal Aid Society of Northeastern New York. Others are having trouble making ends meet on the reduced pension amount. \u201cThese are not people who are looking for a handout,\u201d Esposito said. \u201cThey earned those pensions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act \u2014 otherwise known as ERISA \u2014 sets standards for private pension plans. As part of the act, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. (PBGC) was established. PBGC operates two insurance programs: one covering pension plans sponsored by a single employer and another covering \u201cmultiemployer\u201d pension plans.\n\nHowever, an exemption in the law excludes religious-affiliated pensions from being covered under ERISA. The exemption applies to church-related tax-exempt organizations, which includes some hospitals. Although such entities can choose to be covered by PBGC, there\u2019s no requirement that they pay for the insurance.\n\nAD\n\nSt. Clare\u2019s wasn\u2019t covered. And because of the hospital\u2019s former connection to the Roman Catholic Church, the AARP Foundation, Legal Aid Society of Northeastern New York, Legal Services NYC and a private attorney have filed a lawsuit against the Diocese of Albany.\n\nAD\n\nThe lawsuit, filed under state law, says that the diocese should be held responsible for the insolvency of the pension fund.\n\n\u201cThe hospital took advantage of the church plan exemption because of its close relationship to the Diocese of Albany,\u201d said Dara Smith, a senior attorney with the AARP Foundation. \u201cSo, we believe the diocese is responsible for paying into the pension fund.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the diocese says the church doesn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cThe diocese respects the rights of pensioners to do what they feel is necessary to secure recovery of their lost benefits,\u201d said director of communications Mary DeTurris Poust. \u201cHowever, the Diocese of Albany never managed the St. Clare\u2019s pension fund.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut again, this isn\u2019t just about this one pension plan. There are possibly 1 million people nationwide participating in religious-affiliated pension plans, according to Smith.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not to say that all of them are in financial trouble or anything like that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut because they don\u2019t have the federal backstop, of course there is always more risk.\u201d\n\nAARP\u2019s advice: Check out your church plan.\n\n\u201cMany people would have no idea that they are not protected by federal laws on pensions,\u201d said William Alvarado Rivera, senior vice president for litigation at the AARP Foundation. \u201cIt may well be something that people may want to ask if they\u2019re working for a company, a school, a hospital or some other provider \u2014 to ask whether their pension is being guaranteed under federal law.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs I reviewed the facts in this case, it\u2019s clear to me that Congress needs to revisit the religious-affiliated pension plan exemption. Or many more people might find out too late that a promised safety net has vanished.\n\nReaders may write to Michelle Singletary at The Washington Post, 1301 K St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071 or michelle.singletary@washpost.com.
