'We want to see how wisely the U.S. will pass the end of the year.\n\nNuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have faltered after the collapse of a February summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump where the U.S. side rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a piecemeal deal toward partially surrendering its nuclear capabilities.\n\nPresident Donald Trump meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the North Korean side of the border at the village of Panmunjom in Demilitarized Zone in June 2019. North Korea on Thursday accused U.S. officials of maintaining hostility against Pyongyang despite a 'special' relationship between the two leaders.\n\nPresident Trump, seen speaking at the Shale Insight Conference in Pittsburgh Wednesday, is hearing from North Korea, as it urges Washington to act 'wisely' through the end of the year before a deadline for nuclear reductions\n\nThe North made a series of short-range missile tests while Kim Jong Un said he would 'wait with patience until the end of the year for the United States to come up with a courageous decision.'\n\nWashington and Pyongyang resumed working-level discussion in Sweden earlier this month, but the meeting broke down amid acrimony with the North Koreans calling the talks 'sickening' and accusing the Americans of maintaining an 'old stance and attitude.\n\nThe North has since threatened to resume nuclear and long-range missile tests it suspended last year while pursuing diplomacy with the United States, while Kim Jong Un vowed to overcome U.S.-led international sanctions he said has both pained and infuriated his people.\n\nKim Kye Gwan said Kim Jong Un considers his relationship with Trump as 'special' and that trust between the leaders was still intact.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un in an undated photo as the communist country said Wednesday they 'We want to see how wisely the U.S. will pass the end of the year'\n\n'I sincerely hope that a motive force to overcome all the obstacles between the DPRK and the U.S. and to advance the bilateral relations in the better direction will be provided on the basis of the close relationship,' Kim Kye Gwan said.\n\nIn his mid-70s, Kim Kye Gwan is a veteran diplomat who led the North Korean delegation at much of the now-dormant six-nation nuclear disarmament talks held in Beijing in 2003-2008.\n\nKim Jong Un has signed vague statements calling for the 'complete denuclearization'' of the peninsula in his meetings with Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in since last year. But the North's hardball attitude in past months have raised doubts on whether Kim Jong Un would ever voluntarily give away his nukes he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival.\n\nNorth Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, with Pyongyang vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.", "description": "North Korea says U.S is maintaining hostility against the community nation.
