Yes Ed, go ask Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nTrump interjected his own opinions \u2014 at one point, he stated \u201cSo great Mark!\u201d with a link to Mediaite\u2019s coverage of the interview \u2014 but mostly relied on re-tweets. Several of the tweets that he picked up suggested Henry belonged on CNN instead of Fox News.\n\nThe oddest was a re-tweet of a Twitter user named Trump But About Sharks (@tbasharks) that claims as its mission: \u201cTrump apparently hates sharks, so this bot does some word replacement on his tweets to make them about sharks.\u201c In that spirit, that tweet referred to \u201cthe pro-shark media.\u201d\n\nRT @BulldawgDerek: @foxandfriends A Sunday Morning; Amen Mark Levin, Preach Brother! You shut down Ed Henry and the Pro Shark Media with the fac\u2026 \u2014 Trump But About Sharks (@tbasharks) September 29, 2019\n\nThe final tweet in the sequence featured a tweet by Republican National Committee leader Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairmwoman), in which she wrote: \u201cVoters don't support this impeachment charade & it\u2019s going to backfire come 2020!\u201c In that spirit, the president wrote in response: \u201cWill happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in 50 Trump type Districts. We will win big!\u201c\n\nTrump has been more critical of Fox News than ever before in recent months, taking digs at their coverage at times. In August, for instance, he complained about an appearance by Democratic National Committee spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa. Earlier in the year, he chastised Fox for hosting presidential forums for Democratic presidential candidates, and he\u2019s also attacked the network for its polling results.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/19/05/01ac81a04fe9841486f73f3eb6c6/webp.net-resizeimage%20(42).jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
