Six days after they were rescued from the Mediterranean, the 82 migrants will disembark in Lampedusa (Sicily). \u201cMSF and SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e are relieved,\u201d the tweet added.\n\nItaly\u2019s new government, which won a vote of confidence in the senate on Tuesday \u2013 the final step needed to exercise its full powers \u2013 aimed at drawing a line under a crisis sparked by Salvini, the far-right leader of the League.\n\nGiuseppe Conte, who is on his second mandate as prime minister, had promised to revise the anti-immigration policies introduced by the previous government that provide for the closure of seaports to rescue vessels carrying migrants, the seizure of NGO boats and fines for ships that brought asylum seekers to Italy without permission.\n\nFor over 14 months, NGO rescue vessels, saving lives in the Mediterranean, have been stranded at sea up to 20 days because of the Salvini\u2019s hardline anti-immigration measures. Since June 2018, when he took office in Rome as interior minister, to date, there have been 25 standoffs between rescue vessels and Italian authorities, according to the Institute for International Political Studies (Ispi).\n\nOften, due to the medical and psychological emergency of the migrants on board, the ships have broken the naval blockade imposed by Italy and landed migrants without permission.\n\nIn almost all cases, this has resulted in the temporary seizure of the ship and heavy fines. Last June, Carola Rackete, captain of the NGO rescue vessel, Sea-Watch 3, was arrested after forcing her way into the port of Lampedusa with 40 migrants on board. Rackete risked ramming an Italian military ship that tried to obstruct her entrance into the port. The captain was eventually released.\n\nGermany and France are prepared to take in 25% each of the migrants on aboard the Ocean Viking. The remaining passengers will be redistributed among other EU member states, including Italy.\n\nOn Wednesday, in Brussels, following a meeting with the European council president, Donald Tusk, Conte, said EU member states that refused to share the burden of the arrival of migrants should face financial penalties.\n\n\u201cThose who do not participate in the redistribution of migrants at the European level will feel the impact in a significant way in financial terms,\u201d he said.", "description": "Rome\u2019s new left-leaning government breaks from era of hardline immigration measures pushed by Matteo Salvini", "authors": ["Lorenzo Tondo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d908f909a1713595e9665bb9c0072df2f4a6fd8/462_63_3520_2112/master/3520.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5be4912c2b6bb38206d5965083c9e237", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
