A protester hanging from a harness beneath Brisbane\u2019s Story Bridge and brandishing \u201cclimate emergency\u201d flags was taken into police custody.\n\nAt least 10 people were arrested in the city, and three others were arrested in Sydney after lying in a downtown street intersection.\n\nMore than 100 protesters dressed as bees at Sydney\u2019s Hyde Park to highlight their claim that insects are under threat due to the human impact on the environment.\n\nSome activists camped at Melbourne\u2019s Carlton Gardens overnight before marching to a street corner locked down by more than 100 protesters in inclement weather.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that shutting the city down necessarily wins you many friends,\u201d Victoria premier Daniel Andrews said.\n\nIn Perth, protesters converged outside the offices of The West Australian, the city\u2019s daily newspaper. The front page of Tuesday\u2019s paper was left intentionally blank for protesters to use as a placard.\n\nThe activists are running a \u201cSpring Rebellion\u201d series of demonstrations to pressure the Australian government into declaring a climate emergency.\n\nFounded in Britain last year, Extinction Rebellion has chapters in some 50 countries and wants to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2025.\n\nOn Monday, activists with the movement stopped traffic in European cities and smeared themselves and emblems of Wall Street in fake blood and lay in New York streets.\n\nIn Berlin, 300 people blocked Potsdamer Platz, placing couches, tables, chairs and flowerpots on the road. They earlier set up a tent camp outside German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s office out of dissatisfaction with her government\u2019s climate policy.\n\nMerkel\u2019s chief of staff, Helge Braun, criticized the group\u2019s tactics.\n\n\u201cWe all share an interest in climate protection, and the Paris climate targets are our standard in this,\u201d he told ZDF television. \u201cIf you demonstrate against or for that, that is OK. But if you announce dangerous interventions in road traffic or things like this, of course that is just not on.\u201d\n\n___\n\nRead more stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at https://www.apnews.com/Climate", "description": "PERTH, Australia (AP) \u2014 Activists blocked major roads and demonstrated in Australian cities Tuesday in a second day of global protests by the Extinction", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/07/dd72e1_australia-climate-change-protests-99492-climate-change-protestors-extinction-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
