That's at the top of the range it previously forecast and will translate into $1.3 billion in cash that it will raise in the offering. That price will give the company a valuation of around $8.2 billion, about double the valuation it fetched in its last private funding round one year ago.\n\nThe company expects its shares to begin trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday under the symbol PTON.\n\nPeloton makes stationary bikes and treadmills equipped with interactive displays. It also offers a subscription video service that streams exercise classes to its exercise equipment.\n\nThe company has quickly built up a passionate customer base and seen its sales soar. But it's also posted mounting losses and faces a $300 million lawsuit from top recording artists who allege that it used their songs without permission.\n\nRead this: Peloton, the fitness startup with a cultlike following, could go public at an $8 billion valuation. Insiders reveal why its business seems set to explode.\n\nPeloton's successful IPO stands in sharp contrast to WeWork's failed effort earlier this month to go public. The commercial real-estate company, which a few weeks ago had the highest value of any startup, postponed its offering in the face of Wall Street resistance. It ousted its CEO earlier this week.\n\nGot a tip about Peloton or another company?
