(Although they didn't announce their engagement until a month later).\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge picked quite the location too, during a romantic getaway staying inside one of the luxurious Rutundu log cabins in Kenya.\n\nNestled along the shores of Lake Rutundu, the log cabins are the epitome of rustic chic with elegant wooden exteriors - they're built from large cedar logs found in the surrounding forests - as well as private decks and views of the surrounding landscape including Mount Kenya.\n\n(Image: CAMERA PRESS/Ken Rake)\n\nThe cabins offer ultra privacy, with a long drive to reach them in the heart of the Kenyan landscape.\n\nIn fact, while the cabins have a radio for communication with the nearby Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, the cabins don't have any phone signal so you can go completely off the grid.\n\n(Image: Mark Kehoe/ExpressStar)\n\nIt's no surprise that they were on Prince William's radar for the big moment.\n\nThen of course, the main cabin has everything you could want for a romantic getaway.\n\nFor a start, the cabin boasts a cosy sitting room and dining room complete with plush furniture and a huge log fire, ideal for snuggling up during the colder evenings.\n\n(Image: Mark Kehoe/ExpressStar)\n\nThen there's the cabin's spacious verandah from which you can take in the views, the large kitchen for whipping up some hearty meals, and of course a large bedroom with a double bed and ensuite bathroom.\n\nMeanwhile the smaller cabin (in a separate building) has a large bedroom with a double bed, two single beds and an ensuite bathroom.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/AWL Images RM)\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will have been spoiled for choice with activities too, as the region offers heaps of trails for walking, bird watching, horse riding and fishing.\n\nIt seems that William and Kate may have attempted fishing, as the Duchess quipped about the lack of fish in the sweet note she left in the log cabin's guestbook.\n\n(Image: Mark Kehoe/ExpressStar)\n\nUnsurprisingly, the resort stays pretty tight-lipped about how much a stay would set you back - it only releases prices when you are booking a getaway there.\n\nHowever, if you are looking to have your own once-in-a-lifetime holiday in Africa, you may want to check out our round-up of incredible safari lodges you can book, with prices starting from \u00a380 per night.", "description": "Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton during a romantic getaway in Kenya and in the most beautiful setting", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Getty", "Camera Press Ken Rake", "Mark Kehoe Expressstar", "Getty Images Awl Images Rm"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11593138.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Clarence-House-Announce-The-Engagement-Of-Prince-William-To-Kate-Middleton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
