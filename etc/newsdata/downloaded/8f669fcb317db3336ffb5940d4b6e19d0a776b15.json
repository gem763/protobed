[KOREA PRODUCTIVITY CENTER]\n\nWith growing interest in corporate accountability and social responsibility, sustainability has emerged as a key focus for many businesses.The Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), developed by S&P Dow Jones Indices and RobecoSAM, assesses how well businesses commit to the concept by gauging their progress in environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG).RobecoSAM Managing Director Edoardo Gai explained why the concept is crucial for businesses and discussed the latest trends in Korea during an interview at the Dow Jones Sustainability Index 2019 Conference in Korea on Oct. 22.\u201cIn many parts of the world, it is no longer accepted that a company only thinks about making a profit without considering the externalities they create to society,\u201d said Gai, highlighting the impact companies have on society. \u201cSustainability should not be seen as a cost.\u201d\u201cIf [sustainability] is done in a smart way, it can bring more benefits to the company - a better reputation, additional revenues, better relations with the regulator and with clients and more motivated employees,\u201d he continued.\u201cThis can range from social to environmental issues.\u201dThe DJSI considers many aspects of a business when evaluating it, such as social responsibility, environmental policies and employee relations.Committing to the concept pays off.The three-year return for the Korean version of the index outperformed the benchmark Kospi by 2.5 percentage points as of Oct. 24.\u201cKorea was an early adopter of sustainability,\u201d the expert explained, noting the DJSI Korea created 10 years ago.Korea was the first country in the region with its own DJSI index.Among the total 204 local companies assessed for the local index this year, 40 companies, such as LG Electronics and Lotte Chemical, were included in DJSI Korea.Despite the decade-long interest from Korean companies in the index, they may be losing the initial edge, according to Gai.\u201cWe have seen that the advantage the Korean companies had over the world is diminishing,\u201d said Gai, who also serves as RobecoSAM\u2019s Head of Sustainability Services. \u201cI hope that Korea will continue to lead in the future, but for this they need an extra effort.\u201dKorean companies have an unusually high incidence of corruption, bribery and fraud.\u201cConcentration of such cases in Korea doesn\u2019t propagate a reliable image of Korean companies,\u201d he explained.\u201cIt is important that Korean companies enforce their policy to behave to increase trust from investors.\u201dAccording to the Korea Productivity Center, which co-developed the Korean version of DJSI, the gap between Korean and global companies has widened this year.Compared to companies in the global index, companies in the local index scored lower on average in terms of governance structure, code of ethics, attracting talent, developing talent and risk management.Gai added that there are also more basic transparency problems faced by foreign investors when dealing with Korean companies.\u201cConsidering that the ESG is being integrated into investment processes worldwide, I think it\u2019s important for companies to be more transparent in English for foreign investors to have all the information they need,\u201d he said.Interest in the index has recently grown from businesses, according to Gai.\u201cThe number of companies participating in our questionnaire has grown by over 17 percent [this year], which is very similar to the growth of the United Nations principles of responsible investment signatories,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe think that we have come to a point where the interest from corporations is rapidly growing symmetrically.\u201dThe global version of the index this year had 318 of the most sustainable global firms after assessing the top 2,526 companies around the world.This year\u2019s index includes 19 Korean companies, such as SK Telecom, Samsung Electro-Mechanics and Hyundai Engineering & Construction.\u201cWith increasing interest from asset owners and asset managers, there is a need for a specific index to satisfy the needs of the different clients.\u201dGai added that in an age of trade wars and creeping protectionism, sustainability is all the more important.\u201cIf there are trade conflicts, all companies are affected the same,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s possible for a company to demonstrate that it is a sustainable and responsible player, it might support their relationship with the government because they will see that they are bringing value to the society at large.\u201dBY CHAE YUN-HWAN [chae.yunhwan@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/27210036.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
