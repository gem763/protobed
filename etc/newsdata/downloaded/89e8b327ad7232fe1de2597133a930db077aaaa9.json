Then read our non-spoiler-y review of It Chapter Two instead.\n\nIt\u2019s been years since we got a Stephen King cameo in a movie adaptation of one of his novels, which makes his appearance in It Chapter Two a pleasant surprise. But the real joy of King\u2019s brief role \u2014 he\u2019s the shopkeeper who sells Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy) back his childhood bike, Silver \u2014 is that it plays into one of the film\u2019s cheekiest jokes: the repeated criticism of how Bill opted to conclude his last book. Even in their brief exchange, King\u2019s character finds a way to bring it up. No one can resist telling Bill, a very successful novelist, how disappointed they are with his very bad ending. Sound familiar?\n\nBill is one of King\u2019s many, many writerly characters, but he stands out as a fairly obvious avatar for the author for one reason in particular: Both men have let certain readers down with the ways they\u2019ve chosen to wrap up their stories. King has heard enough complaints about his \u201cbad endings\u201d over the years, so much so that at the conclusion of Game of Thrones he tweeted without provocation: \u201cpeople don\u2019t want ANY ending.\u201d But few of King\u2019s novels have endings more maligned than the original It: the way Mike gets sidelined, the flashback to an underage orgy, and, of course, the revelation that It is a giant space spider who\u2019s laid a bunch of eggs. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of eww here,\u201d one critic wrote in an open letter in 2017, pleading with King to rewrite the ending over 30 years after it was first published. In It Chapter Two, King is finally confronting the lambast \u2014 with a winking cameo, rather than a tweet.\n\nA sequel to Andy Muschietti\u2019s 2017 film, It, Chapter Two is appropriately based on the other half of King\u2019s epic 1986 novel. The first movie installment had already deviated significantly from its source material, but ahead of the sequel, fans wondered how the filmmaking team would adapt or change King\u2019s final pages. Gary Dauberman\u2019s screenplay prods at these expectations immediately, in an early scene that has Peter Bogdanovich \u2014 making his own cameo as the director of a movie version of one of Bill\u2019s books \u2014 telling Bill that he hates his story\u2019s ending. Not to worry, adaptation can make it better, he suggests. Chapter Two is littered with references to Bill\u2019s knack for botching the landing thereafter, inspiring a blend of dread and cautious optimism that hangs over the audience throughout the first two-and-a-half hours of the movie\u2019s nearly three-hour runtime. So it\u2019s a relief when the movie finally arrives at its redux, regardless of how gratifying you find the turn.\n\nAnd what is that turn? Before looking at what the new ending does, it\u2019s worth noting what it doesn\u2019t do. It was always unlikely that the movie would make any attempt to include the novel\u2019s severely misguided group-sex scene, in which all the boys in the Losers\u2019 Club have sex with Beverly, and indeed, that moment is mercifully not one of the childhood memories the adults recover before their final battle. It Chapter Two also wisely reincorporates Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) into the showdown. In the book, Mike is attacked by Henry Bowers and spends the conclusion recuperating in a hospital instead of venturing back into the sewers with his friends. In the movie, Henry (Teach Grant) is dispatched before he can take Mike out of the running, which allows Mike \u2014 the one who has spent his life studying how to stop It, and the sole black member of the Losers\u2019 Club \u2014 to join the fight.\n\nAs for the reveal of It\u2019s true form as a giant spider, rendered with embarrassing 1990 TV-quality effects for the original miniseries: That\u2019s squashed. (As is the novel\u2019s toothless detail that the ancient evil is \u2014 gasp! \u2014 female.) By Chapter Two\u2019s end, It does transform into something resembling a spider, an oversized Pennywise (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) with arachnid legs, and that creature does mortally wound Eddie (James Ransone). But we\u2019re not meant to believe that the spider is It\u2019s final state. In the film, the Losers\u2019 Club members come to the realization that their ever-changing foe is constrained by the physical limitations of whatever form he takes in a moment. In a leap of logic, they decide to surround Pennywise and taunt him with insults about how small and weak he is, somehow bullying It into shrinking down to \u201ctiny clown\u201d size. When Pennywise is a deflated, quivering version of his former self, they\u2019re able to tear out his heart, easily killing It for good.\n\nThis is, admittedly, a bit of a cop-out: Why didn\u2019t they just talk the scary clown into a more manageable size earlier, when he was murdering people left and right? Good question. But this ending does follow a kind of reasoning woven throughout the book and other adaptations \u2014 which emphasizes the staggering, transformative power of the Losers\u2019 Club imagination and community. From a knowledgeable audience member\u2019s perspective, Chapter Two\u2019s finale feels satisfying, simply because it allows the gang to face off against the clown that\u2019s terrorized them since they were kids, rather than an overgrown bug they\u2019ve never seen before.\n\nFew authors have been adapted as many times as King has, and It Chapter Two is far from the first King movie to deviate from his original ending: The Shining ditches the novel version of Jack Torrance\u2019s last-minute moment of clarity and trades the big explosion for a more memorable image of Jack Nicholson\u2019s frozen face. Cujo lets Tad survive, making the preceding 90 minutes of terror worthwhile. And The Mist eschews King\u2019s nonending \u2014 in his own words, his story \u201cpeters off into nothing\u201d \u2014 in favor of a shockingly bleak conclusion that King himself called \u201cterrific.\u201d It Chapter Two is, however, the first to subtly acknowledge just how essential these changes can be.\n\nAt this point in his career, King is relatively gracious about the rebirth of his work; he even called the disastrous 2017 adaptation of The Dark Tower \u201cpretty good.\u201d It could be, as he told Rolling Stone, that \u201cthe movies have never been a big deal to me. The movies are the movies.\u201d Still, for any writer whose work gets adapted \u2014 and particularly for a writer adapted as often as King \u2014 there is a necessary relinquishing of control, an acceptance that once the rights are signed over, filmmakers will take his stories in whichever direction they see fit. Chances are King wouldn\u2019t call his own ending to It bad, but his cameo in Chapter Two feels like a tacit approval of the film\u2019s big finish, not to mention a wink at both his fans and detractors. That he\u2019s able to joke about the criticism now suggests that, like Bill, he has bigger things on his mind.", "description": "Let\u2019s talk about the ending of It Chapter Two, and how Andy Muschietti\u2019s sequel winks at Stephen King\u2019s penchant for bad finales.
