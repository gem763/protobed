Texas", "language": "en", "text": "My once reviled home state is suddenly finding itself embraced in a bear hug as big as, well, Texas.\n\nWhy would this be happening? Because Texas could maybe shift from the Republican column to the Democratic one, that\u2019s why. Suddenly everyone is crazy about us. Like they haven\u2019t been since, oh, 1976, when Texas went for Jimmy Carter and most residents of the state probably regret it to this day.\n\nNow I remember what it\u2019s like to be loved. Houston! Praised as the most diverse city in the nation \u2014 \u00a1Tanto Espa\u00f1ol! \u2014 even from candidates who aren\u2019t native speakers. (Mayor Pete Buttigieg, your accent puts Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s to shame.) Cory Booker scored points by translating the word \u201cno\u201d into Spanish for the folks at home.\n\nThis is an election year when the biggest yahoo comes from New York, and the Texans on the stage talk like the Ivy League smarties they are.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mimi Swartz", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Democratic-Debate-Houston.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
