Therefore, how sounds are heard depends on ear shape.\n\nTo deliver the same sounds (that the creator of the music wants to let users hear) to all users, it was necessary to measure the shape of each user's ear and correct differences.\n\nThe 360 Reality Audio is used in the following way. A special smartphone application is launched, and a picture of a profile is taken in accordance with instructions shown on the smartphone screen. To collect the shape data of the right and left ears, two pictures are taken.\n\nThe 360 Reality Audio uses Sony's \"own audio format\" including not only sound sources but also the location information of sound sources. Therefore, it is possible to optimize the locations of sound sources based on collected data.\n\nWhen I actually listened to music, I clearly recognized the difference among the directions of musical instruments, singing voices, etc.\n\nIn the case of headphones, if the played content supports the 360 Reality Audio, there is no need for special devices. However, it is necessary to apply signal processing to the played sound in accordance with the user's ear shape.\n\nIn the case of speakers, a product that radiates sound to all directions is necessary. Even with audio devices manufactured by other companies, it is possible to use the 360 Reality Audio if they support a distribution format that Sony released to the public.\n\nSony is currently negotiating with companies that provide distribution services, it said. As for devices compatible with the technology, the company said, \"We will start from the technological development of headphones and speakers.\"\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://tech.nikkeibp.co.jp/en/index.html\n\n\u00a9 Nikkei x Tech", "description": "Sony Corp has developed stereophonic sound technology that it calls 360 Reality Audio which is aimed at using a smartphone to realize realistic sounds such as sounds produced by live performance.
