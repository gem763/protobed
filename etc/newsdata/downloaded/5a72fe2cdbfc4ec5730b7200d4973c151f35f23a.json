Here's What Could Happen Next", "language": "en", "text": "Israel\u2019s second election in fewer than six months has ended in political deadlock, leaving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing an uncertain future and paving the way for protracted coalition negotiations. As the official count filtered in on Wednesday, no side emerged with a clear path to government.\n\n\u201cThe era of Netanyahu is over,\u201d claimed one opposition lawmaker as exit polls emerged Tuesday night. But while the prime minister is down, he\u2019s not yet out. As pre-election polls had predicted, Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud party together with allied right-wing nationalist and religious parties fell well short of securing the 61 seats required for a parliamentary majority. But so did his principal opponent Benny Gantz, who leads the nominally centrist party Blue and White. With 91% of the votes counted, Blue and White had 32 seats, with Likud on 31. It remains to be seen which of the two leaders Israel\u2019s President Reuven Rivlin, who occupies a largely ceremonial role, will ask to form a coalition.\n\nBoth, predictably, claimed they could. \u201cIn the next few days, we will begin negotiations to form a strong, Zionist government and in order to avert a dangerous, anti-Zionist government,\u201d a weary looking Netanyahu told supporters in the Likud headquarters late Tuesday night. In Tel Aviv, Gantz said his party would \u201cact to form a broad unity government that will express the will of the people.\u201d\n\nWith Israel now set for coalition negotiations all options are on the table, including a third election. Here are some of the scenarios that might emerge in the coming weeks.\n\nA \u201cNational Unity\u201d Government\n\nThe most likely outcome, although it\u2019s far from assured would be a so-called government of national unity, bringing together the two largest parties, and possibly others across the political spectrum. Gantz and secular nationalist party leader Avigdor Lieberman \u2014 who, as polls predicted, has emerged as a kingmaker \u2014 have both expressed their preference for a liberal national unity government. It would revolve around a partnership between Likud and centrist Blue and White, with or without Lieberman\u2019s party, Yisrael Beiteinu.\n\nThere are several obstacles: the largest being Gantz\u2019s vow not to sit in a government with Netanyahu, citing three looming corruption charges on which Israel\u2019s attorney general has said he would indict Netanyahu, pending a hearing. Over the coming weeks Netanyahu is expected to pull out all the stops to persuade Gantz to rescind on his promise. On Wednesday evening, a senior member of Likud said the door was open for negotiations with Gantz, provided he drop his demand for the party to abandon Netanyahu.\n\nLikud jettisoning Netanyahu is a remote possibility but there is unlikely to be any talk of a putsch until the implications of the election results are clearer. For now, the party Netanyahu has molded in his image has vowed to stick with its leader.\n\nPolitical deadlock and a third election\n\nIsrael\u2019s President Reuven Rivlin will soon decide whether to give Gantz or Netanyahu the first shot at forming a government. Given the latter\u2019s failure to do so in May, and Blue and White\u2019s marginal lead at the latest count, Gantz seems the likelier bet, Israel\u2019s Haaretz suggests. Whomever is given the mandate would have 28 days to form a government, with the option to ask for a short extension.\n\nShould Blue and White and Likud remain in political deadlock, and both sides thwart each other\u2019s attempts to form a government, Israelis could be forced to vote in yet another election early next year.\n\nA Center-left Government with Ultra Orthodox support\n\nEven in a coalition with center left Labor-Gesher, former Prime Minister Ehud Barak\u2019s left wing Democratic Union, and with a potential support arrangement with Israel\u2019s Joint List \u2014 a political alliance of the main Arab-dominated parties in Israel that now comprises the third largest party in Israel\u2019s parliament \u2014 Gantz would be short of a governing majority.\n\nA center-left alliance passing the 61-seat threshold, then, would require Ultra Orthodox parties that traditionally ally with Netanyahu to instead sit with Blue and White, Labor-Gesher and the Democratic Union. The Haredim have worked with Labor governments in the past, but the probability they will do so without Blue and White making unpalatable concessions is slim. On Wednesday, local media reports, one of the two main Ultra Orthodox parties had already vowed to stand with Likud \u201call the way.\u201d", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces an uncertain future and as the official count started coming in, no side emerged with a clear path to government", "authors": ["Joseph Hincks"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jN9tUGfc7WzOeLMh0.AoqA--~B/aD02Mzc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/b7b3001a452589a897fab90b31d6e8fc", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
