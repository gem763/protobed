A judge opts for prison anyway.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE The college admissions scam involving Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman shows how some rich families use a \u201cside door\u201d to game an already unfair education system. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nBOSTON \u2014 One couple, Gregory and Marcia Abbott, told the judge they paid $125,000 to have someone fix their daughter's college entrance exams because she was suffering from chronic Lyme disease and needed a boost.\n\nAttorneys for a father, Robert Flaxman, said he was desperate to help a troubled daughter remain in recovery \u2014 so he paid to cheat in hopes of getting her into a college where she would be safe.\n\nLawyers for another parent, Marjorie Klapper, said she was trying to help her epileptic son who'd suffered a brutal physical assault feel like a \"regular\" student.\n\nThe wealthy parents are among 10 sentenced in the last two months in the nation's college admissions scandal. Each insisted they didn't cheat for the status symbol of their child getting into an elite college or university. Instead they were driven by a feeling people endure regardless of economic class \u2014 desperation.\n\nMore: 'What makes your child entitled?' Judge takes on privilege as she sentences parents in college scam\n\nThey were families in crisis, the parents said, and the scheme's mastermind, the manipulative college consultant Rick Singer, found them at their most vulnerable and seized upon their weakness.\n\nBut their stories, each deeply personal with some details sealed from public court documents, have done little to sway the sentences handed down by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani. Attorneys for the Abbotts, Flaxman and Klapper each asked for no incarceration but got prison anyway. Only one of the 10 sentenced parents has avoided prison altogether.\n\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re a good person in tough circumstances doesn\u2019t mean you can disregard what you know is right,\" Talwani said last week to Flaxman, a real estate developer from Laguna Beach, California, who specializes in luxury resorts. \u201cEven good people who are doing things for people they love can\u2019t be breaking the law.\"\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 08: Attorney Indira Talwani testifies during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee January 8, 2014 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.

Four additional parents pleaded guilty in court Monday, bringing the total to 19 parents out of 35 charged who have pleaded guilty in the case. The latest four won't be sentenced until 2020.\n\nMore: Lori Loughlin, more parents face new bribery charge in college admissions scandal\n\nParents sentenced to date pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud charges. Those citing personal crises tend to have paid into the test-cheating plot and are not part of the group who paid Singer significantly more to have their children tagged as college recruits to facilitate their admissions. Talwani, during a hearing last week, said a level of \"elitism\" was at play with the latter.\n\n'Under a perfect storm, I buckled'\n\nDaniel Medwed, professor of law and criminal justice at Northeastern University School of Law, said a fallback defense strategy in any case is to develop \"mitigation evidence\" \u2014 often hardships \u2014 to demonstrate extenuating circumstances.\n\n\"With clients from impoverished or challenging backgrounds, the argument is to often cite those backgrounds \u2014 that this person never had a chance, they grew up without a roof,\" Medwed said. \"But when your defendants are white privileged folks you can't make a classic hardship argument. So you have to come up with a different hardship.\"\n\nSome of their arguments might not resonate with judge, he said, because it's difficult to \"connect the dots between the hardships and the behavior.\"\n\nThe Abbotts each received one month in prison for paying Singer $50,000 to have someone correct answers on their daughter's ACT exam and $75,000 to do the same for SAT II subject tests. They said they met Singer in 2018 for legitimate counseling for their daughter, who was battling Lyme disease, which forced her out of the classroom and into online homeschooling.\n\nIn emotional remarks to the judge, the Abbotts described their daughter's pain, which included a loss of hair and stamina. It came as their son was dealing with addiction and their 31-year marriage was falling apart, they said. The couple was split between New York and Aspen, Colorado. Amid the turmoil, they gave in when Singer proposed a way to guarantee a test score.\n\n\u201cUnder this perfect storm, I buckled and I accept full responsibility,\" Gregory Abbott said. \"I\u2019m not and never will be a schemer, but was acting out of love for my daughter.\"\n\nGregory Abbott, far left, and his wife Marcia, far right, get into a car as they leave federal court after their sentencing in a nationwide college admissions bribery scandal, Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019, in Boston. (Photo: Elise Amendola, AP)\n\nHis attorney, Daniel Stein, told Talwani his client acted \"not out of greed, narcissism or a sense of entitlement\" but rather \"a sense of desperation.\u201d\n\nWhen it came time for sentencing, Talwani said she was \u201cquite cognizant\" of the family's difficulties. But as the judge has done repeatedly throughout the case, she pointed to imprisonment as a way to deter the public from trying similar illegal schemes.\n\nJudge: 'A serious offense despite good intentions'\n\nKlapper, a jewelry entrepreneur from from Menlo Park, California, was sentenced last week to three weeks in prison for paying Singer $15,000 in 2017 to have someone correct answers on the ACT exam of her younger son. His application also claimed he was African-American and of Latino origin and his parents did not attend college, falsehoods Singer was responsible for, Klapper's defense team said.\n\nHer attorney, Jonathan McDougall, argued for probation instead of incarceration. As mitigating factors, he cited a recent tragic loss in the Klapper family and the assault of her son from multiple assailants after a serious epileptic seizure. They called her motives \"maternal but her execution misguided and illegal.\"\n\n\u201cI deeply regret this path,\" Klapper told Talwani, apologizing to families who need special accommodations like her son but can't afford them. \"I feel like it was at the end of a very long struggle. And for that, I am very sorry.\u201d\n\nMore: Third parent in 24 hours caves in college admissions scandal, agrees to plead guilty\n\nJeweler Marjorie Klapper, right, exits federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., on Wednesday, Oct. 16, 2019.

Certainly everyone\u2019s care for their own child is a factor that moves people to all kinds of ends and struggles and efforts for their children.\"\n\nBut, she added, Klapper's offense \"remains a serious offense despite good intentions.\"\n\nProsecutors say hardships not unlike those millions face\n\nThrough the orchestration of Singer, the daughter of Flaxman took the ACT exam at a testing center in Houston in 2016 alongside the daughter of Manuel and Elizabeth Henriquez, who pleaded guilty in court Monday and faces sentencing in January. Mark Riddell, a private high school counselor paid by Singer, helped them answer questions as a group, prosecutors said, to boost their scores.\n\nWilliam Weinreb, Flaxman's attorney, argued that unlike other parents in the case, Flaxman simply wanted to get into his daughter into college for her own safety. Details of his daughter's issues are redacted in court records, but Weinberg told the judge her treatment team was excited about the idea of a four-year college where she could be looked after.\n\nHis daughter had missed an entire semester of high school, Weinreb said, and had a checkered disciplinary record and modest grades. He said Singer told Flaxman it was unlikely she would get into any college unless she raised her ACT score of 20.\n\n\u201cHe was desperate,\" Weinreb said. \"This was an act of fear.\"\n\nDeveloper Robert Flaxman (C) of Laguna Beach California, leaves the Moakley Federal Courthouse with his attorneys, after being sentenced for his role in the College Admissions Scandal, in Boston on Oct. 18.

They don\u2019t warrant a different outcome from other defendants who face these same hurdles.\u201d\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/23/judge-unswayed-hard-times-parents-college-admission-scandal/4061021002/", "description": "Parents charged in the college admissions scandal said they didn't cheat for status, rather were driven by desperation and personal hardships.", "authors": ["Joey Garrison", "Published A.M.
