Saturday\u2019s Dublin clash was his first Wales start in 15 months, and his rotten injury luck struck again.\n\nWales fly out to Japan on Wednesday and Cardiff Blues\u2019 Jarrod Evans would be a straight replacement for Patchell should boss Gatland need to make an early injury switch into his 31-man squad.\n\nGatland is already without Gareth Anscombe, with the front line fly-half recovering after knee surgery, with Patchell and Dan Biggar the only numbers 10s named in the World Cup squad.\n\nIreland wobbled at the lineout again from the off, Joe Schmidt\u2019s side still getting to grips with the absence of set-piece banker Devin Toner.\n\nBrian O\u2019Driscoll this week insisted omitting Toner from Ireland\u2019s World Cup squad \u201cbeggars belief\u201d, and early on here the lineout jitters certainly backed that stance.\n\nCaptain Rory Best and locks James Ryan and Jean Kleyn warmed to their set-piece task however, with one penalty lineout laying the platform for the game\u2019s first score.\n\nBundee Aki and Stander powered through Wales\u2019 midfield, with the latter clattering Patchell and ending the fly-half\u2019s afternoon prematurely. That quick ball allowed Kearney to ghost past Jonathan Davies and across the whitewash, with a sharp-looking Johnny Sexton posting a smart conversion.\n\nBiggar snatched an interception pass off Sexton to race towards the line, only for Henshaw to haul back the replacement fly-half and deny him a score.\n\nWales kept up the pressure however, with Hadleigh Parkes busting home in style and Leigh Halfpenny\u2019s conversion handing the visitors a 10-7 lead at the break.\n\nIreland built their fluency after the break though, Conor Murray and Sexton running the show in what will prove a huge relief to boss Schmidt.\n\nTighthead prop Furlong powered home to wrestle the lead back into Irish hands and then lock Ryan busted in too.\n\nJack Carty replaced Sexton just past the hour, with Ireland\u2019s premier playmaker withdrawn safe and sound \u2013 to be bubble-wrapped en route to Japan such is his importance to Schmidt\u2019s side.\n\nScrum-half Murray negotiated the encounter unscathed too, which will relieve the Irish public just as much as boss Schmidt.\n\nAdam Beard was sin-binned at the death for Wales, paying the price for the visitors\u2019 repeated infringement, before Ireland closed out their spirited win.\n\nPA", "description": "Rhys Patchell\u2019s third concussion in a year handed Wales\u00a0a big Rugby World Cup injury scare as Ireland\u00a0topped the world rankings for the first time with a 19-10 victory in Dublin.
