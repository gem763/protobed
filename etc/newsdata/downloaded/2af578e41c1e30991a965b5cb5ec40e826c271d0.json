As the group gathered around him listening, someone shouted: \u201cWho made you a speaker?\u201d This spurred the rest of the crowd to break into chants of \u201cno one represents us\u201d and \u201cIran out, out\u201d, denouncing Iraq\u2019s ruling Islamic parties and their Iranian backers.\n\nThe nature of the debate, just like the demonstrations taking place outside the park, was chaotic, boisterous and leaderless. Most of the group were in their 20s, but among them stood two old communists in Che Guevara berets.\n\nEventually, the crowd agreed on a list of demands, which were read out from the steps of the city\u2019s Freedom monument by a young bearded and bespectacled man: \u201cThe resignation of the government, new elections, a change in the elections law and most importantly putting all the government officials on trial.\u201d The crowd cheered, mobile phones were raised and the call was raised to demonstrate in Tahrir Square.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A burning car at the scene outside the local government headquarters in Nasiriyah.

Sparked by the dismissal of a popular general who distinguished himself in the war against Islamic State, the demonstrations have been motivated by a deeper undercurrent of anger towards a corrupt religious oligarchy, a rotten bureaucratic regime and the failure of the Iraqi prime minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, to fulfil any of his campaign pledges after a year in power.\n\nFor a young generation that has grown up in the 16 years that have followed the toppling of Saddam Hussein, elections and representative democracy have become synonymous with corruption and MPs abusing their privileges. Religious parties, many backed by Iran, dominate the political sphere and though oil-rich Iraq has an income of hundreds of billions of dollars, the reality for many citizens is parallel with life in some of the poorest Arab nations: unemployment, a collapsing healthcare system and lack of services.\n\nAs the protests gathered pace on 5 October, Baghdad was on the edge.Under a flyover less than a mile from Tahrir Square a teenager wearing a yellow T-shirt, shorts and flip-flops walked slowly while a police officer brandishing his Kalashnikov rifle chased him away. Thin black columns of smoke twisted into the sky and a crowd \u2013 of fellow teenagers and young men \u2013 started marching towards the square.\n\nPolice standing guard shot in the air but the crowd moved on, waving Iraqi flags and Shia banners.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People run for cover from teargas fired by security forces during a protest on al-Jumhuriya Bridge in Baghdad on Friday. Photograph: -/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTyres were set on fire as the crackle of gunfire became continuous and the sound of teargas canisters being fired became more frequent, white gas mixing with the black fumes from the burning rubber. Back and forth the young men surged, only to be pushed back by the heavy machine-gun fire and teargas.\n\nAmid the carnage, dozens of small three-wheeled tuk-tuk motorcycle rickshaws zoomed between the crowd, ferrying the injured away from the scene. A yellow one carried a man slumped in the back, unable to breathe.\n\nUrging the men to move forward was a short thin young man with a well trimmed ginger beard. \u201cWhy are you standing behind?\u201d He called on the men cowering behind the bridge railing. \u201cThose who don\u2019t want to advance go back home.\u201d\n\nThe man, who gave his name as Jawdat, said he was a former fighter with the Hashd al-Shaabi paramilitary group, which was established in 2014 from disparate armed groups and volunteers to fight against Isis. Hashd al-Shaabi has received training and other support from Iran. Jawdat said his brother was an officer who was killed in the war against Isis.\n\n\u201cI fought with the Hashd, I even went to fight in Syria, but what did I get from this government? Nothing, while those politicians in the Green Zone [in Baghdad] are blocking any attempt to reform the state.\u201d\n\nAmbulances darted back and forth ferrying the injured and the dead \u2013 20 people were killed at that demonstration alone on 5 October.\n\nDuring six days of demonstrations, Abdul-Mahdi appeared on TV every night, promising in a soft voice to create jobs, provide cheap housing and eradicate corruption.\n\nYet young unarmed men were killed as they sought refuge behind concrete barriers or stood in the streets waving flags. In at least one instance snipers positioned on buildings participated in the killings.\n\nActivists and journalists were intimidated, and dozens of them fled Baghdad after receiving threatening phone calls. Media outlets and TV networks were closed. Plainclothes officers roamed hospital wards, detaining injured demonstrators. \u201cThe doctors just patched my injury and told me to leave quickly, after officers entered the hospital looking for demonstrators,\u201d said a young man as he lay in his bed, his injury still bleeding three days after he was shot in a street close to Tahrir Square.\n\nBy 7 October more than 106 people had been killed, and more than 6,000 injured.\n\n\u2018Iran doesn\u2019t want anything that threatens its position here\u2019\n\nThe size of the demonstrations at the start of the month was not abnormal, but what came as a shock was the ferocity of the response.\n\nMany Iraqi observers attributed the violence to the extent to which the regime has been shaken. Others suggested that it was indicative of concern among the country\u2019s pro-Iran militias that the protest were really intended to undermine Tehran.\n\n\u201cIran doesn\u2019t want anything that threatens its position here and that\u2019s why the reaction was so harsh,\u201d said an intelligence officer at the interior ministry.\n\nMany of Iraq\u2019s political parties have ties to Iran and militias that originated there \u2013 a legacy of the aftermath of the 2003 war, when Tehran bolstered Iraq\u2019s newly powerful Shia majority, previously repressed under Saddam\u2019s Sunni Arab Ba\u2019athists.\n\nFatah, the political arm of Hashd al-Shaabi, is Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s remaining major sponsor, after a bloc tied to the firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said it was dropping its support over the weekend.\n\nMilitiamen have been integrated into the security services and have played a central role in the crackdown on the demonstrations. The militias have become a focus of the demonstrators\u2019 anger, a flashpoint for Iran\u2019s perceived control over the Iraqi state.\n\nDuring one night of protests, a clean-shaven, tall unarmed army officer stood in front of crowd of young men, pleading with them to disperse. \u201cI can let you go down and march towards Tahrir Square,\u201d he said pointing at the rising columns of smoke. \u201cBut I swear by Allah that the militiamen and the snipers will kill you.\u201d The crowds responded with angry anti-Iranian chants.\n\n\u2018Our soul, our blood, we sacrifice for you Iraq\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thousands protest over corruption, lack of jobs and poor services in Tahrir Square, Baghdad, on Monday. Photograph: Thaier Al-Sudani/Reuters\n\nLast Friday, a second wave of demonstrations began. The crowds waved Iraqi flags and chanted \u201cour soul, our blood we sacrifice for you Iraq\u201d. At least 74 people were killed over two days, with hundreds more wounded. So far 156people have died and more than 6,090 have been injured, according to government\n\nOn Sunday, Iraq\u2019s elite counter-terrorism service said it had been deployed in Baghdad to protect important state buildings \u201cfrom undisciplined elements\u201d.\n\nProtesters who stayed in Tahrir Square, the epicentre of the demonstrations, over the weekend were joined by thousands of students on Monday who skipped classes at universities and secondary schools. Security forces fired teargas and stun grenades to keep protesters from crossing a main bridge leading to the Green Zone, home to government offices and embassies. The army announced it would impose an overnight curfew in the capital.\n\nYoung protesters also gathered on Monday in the southern cities of Nasiriyah, Hillah and Basra. Even in the holy city of Najaf, dozens of young trainee clerics took to the streets. In Kut, most government offices were shut for lack of staff.\n\nOn the eve of the second wave of protests, an exhausted young intelligence officer sat in a small Japanese saloon car not far from the Green Zone. Since the start of the demonstrations he has been a member of the interior ministry\u2019s operation room.\n\n\u201cWe have issued strict orders to our men not to carry weapons and to stand unarmed among the civilians because we don\u2019t want to be accused of killing demonstrators,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe people who shot at demonstrators [in early October] were members of the [powerful, Iran-backed] Khorasani and Badr militias. The commanders of these militias have been in control since the start.\n\n\u201cLate in September before the start of the demonstrations, we received a secret and urgent [telegram] informing us of the presence of small units of Iranian Revolutionary Guards that had established their positions insidethe Green Zone. [Powerful Iraqi politician] Hadi al-Amiri, and the head of the Khorasani militia were with them.\u201d\n\nThe officer said that from 1 October onwards Iranian and Iraqi militia commanders led the operation room from where the response to the demonstrations has been orchestrated.\n\n\u201cThese militia became the tool to oppress the demonstrations and they still are, this has become open, and done in daylight,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters take to the streets of Hilla, a city in central Iraq, on 28 October. Photograph: -/AFP via Getty Images\n\nObsessed with the idea of a coup in a country were revolutions, wars and upheavals are a recurring event, the government, the religious parties and their Iranian-backed militias have denounced the demonstrators as plotters and former Ba\u2019athists. The protests, so the line goes, have been organised by the US embassy and Gulf states set on toppling Iraq\u2019s Shia government.\n\n\u201cLook at the people around you,\u201d said a 23-year-old lawyer in Sadr city, a suburb of Baghdad, one night in early October, pointing at dozens of children crouching in a small alleyway as bullets whistled over his head. \u201cDo you think the American embassy even knows that this alleyway exists? We are all unemployed, I finished a law school three years ago and I haven\u2019t found a job yet.\u201d\n\nA young man was carried back from the frontline, his leg soaked in blood. A pyre of burning tyres shot orange flames.\n\n\u201cThese are the best demonstrations since 2003,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cAll the previous demonstrations were either organised by Moqtadaal-Sadror the secularists, but this is a genuine leaderless people\u2019s uprising.\u201d", "description": "More than 150 have died and thousands injured in anti-government protests", "authors": ["Ghaith Abdul-Ahad"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03e6283798f30f212c9f1297d827361ac19995c2/0_240_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f68c90580489edc02adcf732fa1975cc", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
