That\u2019s the shoes\u2019 way of telling you\u2014a little wobble, a little give\u2014that all is well: that the shock of your footfall, heelfloortoe, heelfloortoe, is being absorbed. Dolly Singh, the CEO of the shoe design firm Thesis Couture, is explaining this as I walk in a prototype version of footwear that has thus far been, due to limitations that are only partially technological in nature, pretty much impossible to imagine: shoes that are at once extremely high and relatively comfortable to wear. \u201cWhat you should be feeling is, hopefully, a lot less pinch in the front than you normally do in 4-inch heels,\u201d Singh tells me. \u201cBecause of this arch-support area\u201d\u2014she points toward the sole of the model I\u2019m wearing\u2014\u201cit\u2019s supposed to push your weight back towards your heel.\u201d Related Stories All the Heels: Claire Underwood and the Case of the Stay-Put Stiletto\n\nThe Perma-Pump: Jurassic World's Silliest Character\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Wear Heels? You know what? It does. Or, at least, walking in a pair of Thesis stilettos\u2014whose shanks, and heels, are constructed mostly of dense, slightly flexible polymer (\u201cballistics-grade,\u201d Thesis\u2019s marketing literature points out)\u2014minimized the reflex that walking in heels normally produces in me: the need to adjust my limbs and my overall self to compensate for my unnaturally raised foot. The shoes I\u2019m wearing, Singh told me, are only about 70 percent completed, design-wise; still, even at the prototype stage, you feel that cushion and that give and that reassuring little bounce. You feel the shock of your walk being eased. You definitely would not run in these shoes, in the manner of Carrie Bradshavian fantasy; you could, however, very reasonably walk in them. At least for, you know, a little while. Singh, 37, is a former recruiter at SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s rocket engineering firm whose offices in Hawthorne, CA, consist largely of hangar and factory space. She spent much of her time on that job walking\u2014\u201cabout 3 to 4 miles a day,\u201d she recalls\u2014on hard floors that were particularly ill-suited to the wearing of heels. She wore them anyway: Working in an industry dominated by men, she appreciated the few extra inches of height the shoes gave her. (And also: the sense of professionalism, and of femininity.) It didn\u2019t take much research to realize that many women, every day, live their own version of that compromise. So, when Singh left SpaceX, she recruited some of its employees\u2014among them, yes, a rocket scientist and a former astronaut\u2014to help solve a problem that is generally not treated as a problem at all so much as an unfortunate fact of ladylife: the insult and occasionally the injury that can come from the wearing of heels.\n\nS tripped of their symbolism, heels are, simply, shoes like any other: objects that help to separate the human foot, which is inconveniently soft, from the surface of the earth, which is inconveniently hard. And yet, of course, heels do\u2014heels are\u2014so much more than mere footwear. In their teetering heights, they make audacious assumptions about fashion and feminism and professionalism and sex and privilege and power and its opposite, and about the way all those things, in the early 21st century, chafe against each other. Heels at once lift women up and hold them\u2014hold us\u2014back. And, of course: We choose, day by day and week by week and Special Occasion by Special Occasion, to let them do it. Heels are both a claim of femininity and a test of it. They are the bindings of the willfully bound. \u201cI hate high heels, more than anything.\u201d - Cara Delevingne In that sense, while Thesis\u2019s comfortable heel represents a small feat, so to speak, it also represents a very large one: a counterargument to a longstanding assumption\u2014rendered in fashion as well as in many other areas of the culture\u2014that womanhood is defined, in part, by the ability to bear pain. Not just in the sense of \u201csuffering for beauty,\u201d as the saying goes, but in the deeper sense that the collision of those two things is integral to feminine experience. It\u2019s an assumption that helps to explain why stilettos have become such quintessential symbols of womanhood; it also helps to explain why they are, as those symbols, so deeply unsettling. Heels hurt. They slow their wearers down. They occasionally trip them up.\n\nWhat Thesis\u2019s work suggests, though, is that the technology of the heel, the manufactured thing that takes its name from the natural one, could change the politics of the heel. The comfortable stiletto Thesis is promising is one that, simply because it hurts its wearers less, also demands less of them\u2014and, by extension, of all of us. Thesis is certainly not the first company to claim to have made a comfortable heel. What makes its approach unique, though, is that it isn\u2019t relying on low heel heights or thick heel widths or wide toe boxes or excessive interior padding\u2014the stuff of dancing shoes and Naturalizers and their ilk\u2014to improve its heels\u2019 comfort levels. (\u201cComfort shoe,\u201d indeed, is something of an epithet around Thesis\u2019s sleek L.A. office.) Instead, the company reconsidered the architectural framework of the shoe. The people Singh recruited, from SpaceX and elsewhere, to advise Thesis in doing that work included Hans Koenigsmann, the (yes) rocket scientist. And Garrett Reisman, the (yes) former astronaut. And Matt Thomas, the former director of mechanical engineering at Oculus VR, the (now-Facebook-owned) virtual reality firm. And Andy Goldberg, an orthopedic surgeon. And Francis Bitonti, a designer\u2014he created that iconic, 3-D-printed gown for the burlesque star Dita Von Teese\u2014who has become an expert at using algorithms to ensure garments\u2019 fit. Singh also brought on Amanda Parkes, a fashion technologist, to ensure that the shoes the company created would be stylish as well as comfortable. Not running-shoe-comfortable, to be extra-clear, but for-a-high-heel-comfortable. \u201cWhat we\u2019re fundamentally trying to do,\u201d Singh explains, \u201cis make a stiletto that feels like a wedge.\u201d To achieve that, the team first replaced the thin, metal spike that supports the typical heel with one made of that ballistics-grade polymer. Just as importantly, though, they played around with the shank of the shoe\u2014the base of the sole, the structure that does the all-important work of arch support\u2014in order to distribute the wearer\u2019s weight toward the heel and thus away from the ball of the foot, the source of so much orthopedic pain. Thesis\u2019s S-curved shanks lead to shoes that concentrate only about 50 percent of the wearer\u2019s weight there\u2014an improvement from the current industry average of 80 percent.\n\nThe whole thing was much more complicated than Singh first anticipated. \u201cI came from rockets and VR,\u201d she notes. \u201cI thought that six months after I started this project, I\u2019d have the most amazing shoes that the planet has ever seen. And here I am, three years later\u2014and I\u2019m almost finished.\u201d It\u2019s appropriate, though, that creating those shoes would transform from a \u201cproject\u201d to a broader purpose: The appeal of heels\u2014not just of sky-high stilettos, but also of their less audacious cousins\u2014lies, most broadly, in their ability to function not just as footwear, but also as small, wearable symbols of mankind\u2019s tendency toward restless ambition. Heels have emerged from roughly the same impulse that led to cathedrals and skyscrapers and, yes, rockets: our desire to be taller, and grander, and generally more than we once were. \u201cYou never find wonderful and great things on the ground, but instead placed on high, to fill others with wonder and reverence,\u201d Arcangela Tarabotti, a Venetian nun, argued in the 17th century. She was defending a very early version of the stiletto. \u201cThe core of my work is dedicated not to pleasing women but to pleasing men.\u201d - Christian Louboutin So you can ask why heels, given all that they demand of their wearers, continue to be so popular\u2014and, indeed, to be such easy tokens of femininity, used in everything from baked goods to office products to houses of worship. You can point out all the compromises, large and small, that must be made when a person\u2014usually, but not always, a female person\u2014buys, and wears, and navigates the world upon, a pair of upthrust metal spikes. You can say (as Carrie Bradshaw, that character who derived so hefty a portion of her identity from her Manolo Blahniks, might have): I couldn\u2019t help but wonder \u2026 What puts the \u201cI\u201d in \u201chigh heels\u201d?\n\nBut to do all that, fashion being what it is, you also have to acknowledge all the things we women gain, or are told that we gain, from the wearing of heels, aesthetically and professionally and otherwise. Thesis Couture plans to include just 1,500 pairs of shoes\u2014retail price: $925 each\u2014in its inaugural line, coming out this fall. At a recent soft-launch event, in New York, Singh announced to the assembled crowd that they could add their names to the waiting list of people who have expressed advance interest in purchasing one of those pairs. The list, Singh told me, currently has more than 10,000 names. So, yes: Let\u2019s talk about the \u201cI\u201d in \u201chigh heels.\u201d But first let\u2019s talk about the we. Y ouTube, in its capacity as a massive, user-generated advice column, has many tips on offer about the best ways to walk in heels. The mega-vlogger Michelle Phan\u2019s \u201cHow to Master the High Heel\u201d tutorial\u20143.5 million views so far\u2014provides an appropriately step-by-step approach. \u201cYour first assignment when walking in heels,\u201d she says, \u201cis to find a straight line and follow it.\u201d Phan pays particular attention to the distinct challenges presented by cobblestones (\u201cfor every step you take, you need to have a general awareness of where your heel is being placed\u201d), and grass (\u201ckeep your weight on your toes\u201d), and stairs (descending them, in particular, \u201cit\u2019s all about keeping a steady pace and a firm placement on each step\u201d\u2014but also, just to be safe, \u201cuse the handrail\u201d). Phan also offers a more generalized tip for effective heel-ing: \u201cPutting on your favorite upbeat song will help you get in the mood as you practice your walk.\u201d\n\nPhan\u2019s tips are joined, and occasionally contradicted, by thousands more. Kassandra Brooks reiterates the importance of preparation when it comes to walking in heels: \u201cSeriously, girls: practice, practice, practice!\u201d she coaches. Victor Chu, a shoe designer who teaches a class about how to walk in heels, recommends that you \u201cengage your abs\u2014this gives you poise and control\u201d\u2014and \u201cwalk heel to toe, which transfers impact to the leg instead of the ball of the foot.\u201d (Also, \u201crelax your hips and knees so you\u2019ll be fluid and graceful.\u201d) Pooja from Glamrs.com recommends swiping deodorant onto the feet to minimize the friction of heels. (Ellebangs, for the record, says that the same blister-preventing effect can be achieved with baby powder.) \u201cIf [the shoes are] a little bit loose, you can always shove toilet paper into the front,\u201d the model Cassandra Bankson points out. And Buzzfeed\u2019s \u201cULTIMATE HIGH HEEL SURVIVAL GUIDE\u201d offers, in addition to advice concerning Moleskin and gel inserts and Band-Aids, some broader coaching: \u201cDon\u2019t give up!\u201d\n\nThe Heel Advice Industrial Complex\u2014a collective composed mostly of women generously helping each other, but more broadly of people trying to make a side-door profit from the large and steadily expanding U.S. shoe industry\u2014owes its size, and its longevity, to the fact that none of its tips have thus far succeeded in keeping their own promise: that heels can function, effectively, as footwear. \u201cA shoe, like a building\u2014or, on a much smaller scale, anything that supports or distributes weight in some way\u2014requires architectural consideration,\u201d Samantha Cataldo, who brought the traveling \u201cKiller Heels\u201d exhibition to the Currier Museum in Manchester, NH, told me. The discomfort of high heels\u2014the fact that they ultimately fail at the job of being functional\u2014is evidence, in that sense, of technological failure. And so is the fact that heels tend to make that most basic of human activities\u2014walking\u2014a little bit precarious. \u201cStilettos,\u201d in particular: Their name comes from the Italian for \u201cdagger,\u201d but their shape suggests a broader menace. Heels that are both skinny and sky-scraping are the things that, in 1993, led Naomi Campbell to trip, dramatically, on Vivienne Westwood\u2019s runway, the victim of the designer\u2019s Super Elevated Gillie heels. They are the things that, in 2013, felled Jennifer Lawrence as she took to the stage to accept her Academy Award. They are the things that, in an episode of Sex and the City, found Carrie walking in a friend\u2019s fashion show, swaggering in a pair of stilettos ... until, in short order, she tripped on them. There Carrie was, channeling Naomi: splayed on the runway, brought low by the very footwear she\u2019d trusted to raise her up. It\u2019s telling, too, that Sarah Jessica Parker, a real-life lover of heels, reportedly suffers from foot-related health problems. So does her fellow heelaholic, Victoria Beckham. (This is another of Thesis Couture\u2019s main selling points: Its shoes are shots against the prevailing assumption that, as Singh puts it, \u201cyou get frumpier shoes, or you\u2019re going to get frumpier feet.\u201d) A study conducted in 2014 by the American Podiatric Medical Association found 38 percent of women saying they\u2019d wear a shoe they liked even if it caused discomfort; another 71 percent said they already have a heel-related foot ailment.\n\nHeels, indeed, are thought to be the cause of much of the roughly $3.5 billion that women in the United States spend each year on foot surgeries. The desire to wear them comfortably has led some women to get botulism\u2014Botox\u2014injected into their feet: Dr. Scholl meeting Dr. Frankenstein. That same desire is the source of \u201cHaglund\u2019s deformity,\u201d a painful condition that has been given the revealing nickname of \u201cpump bump,\u201d and also of bunions and hammertoes and many more extremely preventable podiatric ailments. Each year, thousands of news articles are produced reiterating the health risks of heels. Each year, they are ignored. \u201cWomen,\u201d the podiatrist Michael Liebow marveled to The Washington Post, \u201cwill wear their high-heeled shoes until their feet are bloody stumps.\u201d\n\nT he extremes of effort women put into the wearing of high-heeled shoes speak to something so obvious\u2014or at least to something so widely assumed\u2014that it seems silly even to specify: that heels are, in addition to everything else, sexy. When Beyonc\u00e9 sings, in \u201cCountdown,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m all up under him like it\u2019s cold, winter time / All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time\u201d \u2026 it is extremely clear what she really means by \u201cdinner.\u201d Women wear heels, in part, to reap the benefits of their ability to lengthen the leg and firm the calves and protrude the pelvis and affect the walk in Darwinianly dutiful ways. Heels function, the University of Portsmouth psychologist Paul Morris and his co-authors suggested in a 2013 paper, as \u201csupernormal stimuli\u201d: Walking in them exaggerates \u201csome sex-speci\ufb01c elements of female gait,\u201d encouraging \u201cgreater pelvic rotation, increased vertical motion at the hip, shorter strides, and higher number of steps per minute.\u201d Kara Gordon / The Atlantic That many women\u2014on behalf, generally, of many men\u2014seem to understand all this intuitively is the reason for articles like Cosmopolitan\u2019s \u201c20 Heels Men Find So Freaking Hot.\u201d But here\u2019s another thing\u2014a related thing, and also a deeply conflicting thing\u2014that many women seem to understand: that heels are, especially in the various knowledge-work industries, the expected foundation of a woman\u2019s professional uniform. They are a much less comfortable, but equally conformist, version of the male suit-and-tie: a price of entry to a C-suite or a Senate office or any of the other places traditionally occupied by men. (See: Sheryl Sandberg and Marissa Mayer, TED-talking and speech-giving and otherwise boss-ladying in soaring stilettos. See also: Dolly Singh, walking miles a day in factories and in hangars and in heels.)\n\nWhich means that failing to wear heels, the logic goes, might even hold women\u2019s careers back. As Marie Claire put it in a 2013 article about the sartorial\u2014and professional\u2014pitfalls of \u201ccasual Friday\u201d: It gets tricky with shoes, especially flats, which for many women are a casual Friday mainstay. I\u2019ve interviewed countless women CEOs, founders, and top-level execs over the years\u2014not a single one in flats, which exude a kind of demure good-girl quality that rarely telegraphs power. If you\u2019re ambitious, with your eyes steadily fixed on a corner office, you\u2019d do well to save them for weekends and stick with pumps or kitten heels. So. Heels as power. Heels as sex, co-opted in the name of professionalism. Heels as, in all that, ambition. Avery Jessup, the hyper-ambitious Fox News reporter on 30 Rock, summarized the thinking perfectly: \u201cFlats,\u201d she declared, \u201care for quitters.\u201d RuPaul would agree. Here\u2019s another irony, though: The shoes women wear in the service of both professional expectations and sexual ones, shoes that at once celebrate and underplay the murky connections between the two, are often not really respected by \u2026 men in the workplace. The shoes that can bring women up to the level, physically and otherwise, of their male colleagues can also end up diminishing them. That might be because of incidental features\u2014\u201cnothing is more aggravating than listening high heels clicking on the tile at work in the morning,\u201d the Twitter user David Schenk recently [sic] put it\u2014but it is mostly because of high heels\u2019 professional paradox: the fact that the default footwear of corporate conformity is so stridently suggestive of sex. According to the researchers Raj Persaud and Adrian Furnham, discussing Paul Morris\u2019s paper, \u201cFemale baboons with a larger than normal swelling of the bottom, associated with the sexually receptive period of their cycle, arouse greater sexual interest in males. High heels similarly exaggerate the sex-speci\ufb01c aspects of the female walk, which could cause sexual arousal in males.\u201d Taken to its extreme, the paradox accuses heels of emphasizing the body at the expense of the mind. At a tech conference in 2013, Jorge Cortell, the CEO of a healthcare startup, noticed a fellow attendee standing in a pair of very tall stilettos. He snapped a picture of the shoes. He then tweeted the picture of the shoes with the caption, \u201cEvent supposed to be for entrepreneurs, VCs, but these heels (I\u2019ve seen several like this) \u2026 WTF?\u201d He concluded his observation with a hashtag: #brainsnotrequired.\u201d\n\nCortell\u2019s creep-shot went viral; that is mostly because its caption rightly made people mad, but it is also because its assumptions struck a much deeper nerve. The tweet harkened back, on the one hand, to the Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, who tried women \u201cwho used footwear as an entrapment and seduction of men\u201d for, yep, witchcraft. But it also reflected a more modern pitfall: the idea that heels are, essentially, a form of cheating\u2014a strategy for compensating not just for a relatively small stature, but for a relatively small intellect. Which is not, generally speaking, a strategy that is available to men (many of whom would probably enjoy being a few inches taller). Thus: heel-shaming. Sole-policing. #brainsnotrequired-ing. \u201cI\u2019ve overheard conversations at academic gatherings,\u201d the University of Exeter professor Francesca Stavrakopoulou wrote in 2014, \u201cin which female colleagues have been described as \u2018power-dressing\u2019\u2014coded language used to accuse a woman of asserting herself in overly ambitious ways.\u201d \u201cWomen will wear their high-heeled shoes until their feet are bloody stumps.\u201d - podiatrist Michael Liebow That tension\u2014women, dressed down for the crime of dressing up\u2014is on the one hand simply another aspect of the broader catch-22 that any members of a media-driven society must navigate every day: Look good, but don\u2019t you dare be caught trying too hard to look good. But heels represent a particular strain of that paradox: Many men, though they may well love what heels do to the female form\u2014there are of course many more than Cosmo\u2019s 20 pairs of stilettos out there that men find so freaking hot\u2014also seem to think that heels are, simply, silly. Steve Martin mocks them via his musical bit on \u201ccruel heels.\u201d The journalist Martin Daubney, after a day spent wearing six-inch stilettos, notes that \u201cI finally understand why women say \u2018it\u2019s torture in these heels.\u2019\u201d One of the heel-try-ers in Buzzfeed\u2019s \u201cMen Try Heels For A Day\u201d video complains, \u201cThis is a fucking mess\u2014how am I supposed to walk in this?\u201d Another declares, having gone through only a portion of his stunt-stipulated day in elevated footwear: \u201cMy thoughts on heels are very much the same as they were in the beginning: that they\u2019re stupid.\u201d His thoughts are, it turns out, part of a long-standing tradition when it comes to the gender dynamics of heels. In 1660, in one of his journal entries, the great diarist Samuel Pepys wrote, In the morning to my office, where, after I had drank my morning draft at Will\u2019s with Ethell and Mr. Stevens, I went and told part of the excise money till twelve o\u2019clock, and then called on my wife and took her to Mr. Pierces, she in the way being exceedingly troubled with a pair of new pattens, and I vexed to go so slow, it being late. Pattens\u2014clogs, essentially, their wooden soles stacked upon inches-high metal rings\u2014were one of the 17th century\u2019s most popular forms of elevated shoe. Thus did Pepys and his wife join in a ritual that had been performed by many couples before, and that would be continued by many long after: a woman, struggling to walk in her high shoes; a man, struggling to disguise his annoyance at being slowed down.\n\nA nd yet. And yet! Despite all of this\u2014despite heels\u2019 danger and discomfort, despite the tutting and the mocking and the difficulty walking \u2026 women keep buying heels. We keep wearing them. Reader: I keep wearing them! I, too, have dutifully pasted my DreamWalk\u00ae insoles into some bedazzled 3-inchers in preparation for a friend\u2019s wedding. I, too, have tried to take Victor Chu\u2019s advice to walk \u201cfluidly and gracefully\u201d in those shoes. I, too, have failed. The 3.5 million views Michelle Phan\u2019s \u201cHow to Master the High Heel\u201d tutorial has received since its posting in 2013 are signs of her overall popularity, sure, but they are evidence of something else, too: all the people out there who really, really want to achieve that mastery. \u201cI think it is in our DNA as women to want to be peacocks and strut our stuff,\u201d Tina Sloan, a longtime soap opera actor, put it. The \u201cKiller Heels\u201d exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum, in 2014, took visitors through a corridor whose walls were covered with Polaroids of women\u2019s heel-clad feet. The images included Sharpie-scrawled captions the women had provided: single-word answers to the question of how the shoes made them feel. \u201cFierce,\u201d read one. \u201cClassic!\u201d read another. \u201cOn fire,\u201d read another. And also: \u201cWow!\u201d \u201cCool.\u201d \u201cIn charge.\u201d \u201cMy thoughts on heels are very much the same as they were in the beginning: that they\u2019re stupid.\u201d - a guy, after a day spent wearing them So the answer to the why? of heels\u2014why, in spite of everything, do women, by which I mean myself and maybe you, keep wearing them?\u2014cannot simply be that heels are a commercial decision women make in the name of style. It\u2019s much, much more complicated than that. Heels\u2019 current desirability is the result of various cultural tautologies: They are attractive, basically, because we have told ourselves that they are. They are professional, basically, because we have decided that they are. They are what they are because of what we, all of us, are.\n\nSo the many factors at play in heels\u2019 metonymic femininity make it extremely difficult to disentangle the Google search that leads people to Michelle Phan\u2019s video from the conventional wisdom holding that heels, and specifically female bodies walking in heels, are hot. When Dita Von Teese announces that \u201cheels and red lipstick will put the fear of God into people,\u201d that may be the culmination of her own experience, but it is also the product of centuries\u2019 worth of cultural input. So is the reality-star-turned-lifestyle-guru Kristin Cavallari\u2019s decision to title her memoir Balancing in Heels. Heels are subject to all the assorted complexities that will be layered, parfait-like, onto any question of fashion. And yet the extremes they represent\u2014the highs and lows, the aspiration and the acquiescence\u2014make them especially apt as symbols for the current moment: one in which feminism\u2019s various waves have evaporated, in some sense, into an air of possibility, and also of confusion. One that in many ways takes women\u2019s equality for granted, and that in many others totally does not. One that is renavigating sex\u2019s place in the workplace. One that is typified by a heel-clad Beyonc\u00e9\u2014a wife and a mother and also pretty much the dictionary definition of \u201chot\u201d\u2014strutting onstage as the word \u201cFEMINIST\u201d flashes on a screen behind her. One that finds Mattel redesigning the feet of its Barbie dolls so that they are not permanently molded to accommodate heels.\n\nIt\u2019s a moment that is unsure, basically, whether feminine footwear that evokes the swollen butts of baboons celebrates, in the end, empowerment or submission. \u201cI do not improvise in heels. I improvise in sneakers. Why would I improvise in heels? It\u2019s terrible.\u201d - Amy Poehler And: It\u2019s one that finds the wearing of heels\u2014or, conversely, the non-wearing of them\u2014representing much more of a choice than it did for those who came before. \u201cFashionable suffering is no longer obligatory as it was for our grandmothers,\u201d Nancy Rexford, the author of Women\u2019s Shoes in America: 1795 to 1930, puts it. \u201cIf a woman wears cruel shoes,\u201d she adds, \u201cwe can be sure it is by choice.\u201d And yet, of course, that \u201cchoice\u201d will be informed by all the cultural and sexual and professional and sartorial expectations that can make shoes, symbolically as well as physically, uncomfortable. (Are heels sexist? Oh, totally. Or, well, maybe? How can you tell? (And also: Is makeup sexist? Or long hair? Leg-shaving? Bikini-waxing? Spanx?)) \u201cIt\u2019s always seemed to me that the point was to be able to wear what you fucking well please, as I\u2019m often quoted as saying,\u201d Gloria Steinem explained. She continued, though: On the other hand, there are some symbols that were so forced on us in my youth that it\u2019s hard for me to understand them as a free choice. Like girdles, garter belts, and very high heels that you can\u2019t run in \u2026 but even if I felt internally uneasy, I don\u2019t believe I ever was publicly critical of something another woman said she had freely chosen. So even Gloria Steinem, it seems, is a little confused about heels. Which is both reassuring and no help at all. The only thing clear at this point seems to be that heels, as symbols, require of the culture precisely what they require of their wearers: compromise. Carefulness. Step-by-step transactions. Heels give power and they take it. Michelle Phan chooses to buy stilettos; she works hard at walking in them; she gets confidence from wearing them. And yet her final piece of advice for wearing them on a night out is this: \u201cBring a pair of flats! And if you don\u2019t have a pair of flats, get someone to carry you home!\u201d Phan\u2019s cheery tutorial cuts to video of her grinning as she perches upon the back of a gallant young gentleman. Together, they gallop off into the sunset, beautifully fused\u2014two minds, two hearts, and one pair of functioning feet.\n\nF urther complicating things is the fact that heels, pretty much throughout their history, have been designed by men. And men, in general, being the ones who will see the shoes but not wear them, tend to design heels with a focus on their aesthetics, rather than their ergonomics. Christian Louboutin, the moment\u2019s reigning heel-maker, recently declared, without any apparent irony: \u201cThe core of my work is dedicated not to pleasing women but to pleasing men.\u201d The stiletto, in particular\u2014the shoe that serves, at this point, as the Platonic pump\u2014co-evolved as an idea, the historian Elizabeth Semmelhack argues, with the invention of photography. Which was also, human nature being what it is, the rise of photographic pornography. The entrepreneurial pornographers of the 19th century clad their subjects in heeled shoes that would complement a woman\u2019s legs as she laid and lounged, languidly and otherwise nakedly; the shoes\u2019 presence in the photos reflected a desire, Semmelhack suggests, to prevent the models \u201cfrom drifting into the allegorical realm.\u201d (An airy goddess doesn\u2019t wear heels; a regular, flesh-and-blood woman, however, might.) \u201cI think it is in our DNA as women to want to be peacocks and strut our stuff.\u201d - Tina Sloan, soap opera actor The images that arose from the collision of new technological capability and age-old human impulse served as formats for the ones that would come to permeate the culture later on\u2014from advertisements (airbrushed pictures of women wearing little save for heels, used to sell everything from cars to stockings, to women as well as men) to the iconic \u201cpin-ups\u201d that would festoon the walls of so many bedrooms across the country. Those images did not, however, offer a format for actual footwear. Stilettos, as depicted in those commercial images, couldn\u2019t yet exist as wearable, walkable footwear; it was not until the advent of modern steel production, in the 20th century, that functional versions could be fabricated. Only then\u2014via the designer Roger Vivier, who would go on to liken his spindly, space-age-y shoes to \u201cwearing dreams on one\u2019s feet\u201d\u2014could the heels that had existed for so long as objects of male fantasy actually be worn by their putative consumers. Marilyn Monroe was, perhaps unwittingly, on to something when she declared, \u201cI don\u2019t know who invented high heels, but all women owe him a lot!\u201d\n\nMen\u2019s heels, though, were also victims of a broader trend. \u201cWith the gradual rise of democracy and capitalism,\u201d Valerie Steele, the director and chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told me, \u201cnot only did high heels for men, but also color in clothing for men, jewelry, decoration, lace\u2014all went out and became re-defined as being feminine rather than aristocratic.\u201d Heels, because of that, \u201cwere now seen as effeminate: not acceptable for men to wear.\u201d Indeed, when Napol\u00e9on crowned himself emperor in 1804, he made a point of wearing flats. The Napoleonic distaste for the heel endured, and expanded; it would be more than a century before men would dip their toes once more into heels, those \u201cirrational,\u201d \u201cfeminine\u201d forms of footwear. Women, on the other hand\u2014who would of course be dismissed as irrational regardless of what they put on their feet\u2014continued, save for some dabbling in Classical-inspired flats in the early-18th century, to claim heels for themselves. The punishing paradox they represented back then\u2014heels treated as both requirements for feminine beauty and evidence of feminine frivolity\u2014will feel vaguely familiar today. As a New York Times article from 1871 (tellingly headlined \u201cMake-believe Shoes\u201d) proclaimed, Suffrage! Right to hold office! Show us first the woman who has independence and sense and taste enough to dress attractively and yet to walk down Fifth-avenue wearing \u2026 a show which does not destroy both her comfort and her gait. That mainstream dismissal of heels continued on into the 20th century\u2014even as some men began experimenting with them again. In 1965, Time magazine announced that \u201csomewhat alarmingly, teenage boys are taking to high heels.\u201d Those boys would be imitated by, among others, John Travolta, catching Saturday Night Fever in high-heeled boots; and by David Bowie, strutting in his inches-high platforms; and by Prince, rocking stilettos; and by the members of KISS, whose elaborately heeled boots became anthemic to rocking and rolling all night/partying every day.\n\nThe men\u2019s forays into elevated footwear, however, were fleeting, and aimed more at making a point than making an enduring style. For the most part, men-in-heels has been relegated to rodeos and drag shows. (Think, today, of the mockery recently leveled at former presidential candidate Marco Rubio when he stepped out on the campaign trail in inch-high boots.) No matter how much gender equality we claim to have attained as a culture\u2014no matter how much of men\u2019s fashion has become, in recent years, tighter and brighter and more flamboyant than it used to be\u2014heels have remained, by default and by design, womenswear. And they have, in that, retained some of the Enlightenment-era dismissals of feminine fashion as impractical and, indeed, irrational. My thoughts on heels are very much the same as they were in the beginning: that they\u2019re stupid. \u201cWhy do we wear them? They\u2019re so painful. And pointless, really. You know, I really would like to urge everyone to stop it. Just stop it.\u201d - Emma Thompson That is partly because of Roger Vivier and his introduction, in the 1950s, of the stilettos that managed to be at once futuristic and retrograde. The new shoe represented technological progress, via the thin heel of extruded steel that Vivier referred to as \u201cthe needle\u201d; it also, however, with its height and its relative skimpiness, represented a new form of conservatism. Here was the cult of domesticity\u2014the stuff born of Victorian ideals, the stuff that produced the ennui that Betty Friedan would later bemoan\u2014neatly embodied in footwear. Here was Cinderella\u2019s glass slipper, tiny and magical and impossible, rendered as sartorial expectation. Here was a design that was decently well suited for wear upon the carpets and linoleums and constraints of the home; here was a design that, tellingly, was not well suited for navigating the world beyond.\n\nStilettos, born of the porn of the 19th century, thus in the 20th adopted another dimension of male desire: the wish for loyal housewives\u2014for women who would always be home, waiting for you and, indeed, on you. Because in those shoes, they couldn\u2019t do much else. The stiletto briefly went out of style in the \u201960s and \u201970s, its dainty lines replaced with bold, stacked heels and very high platforms; by the \u201980s, however, it returned\u2014and came back taller than ever. And there it stayed. There was Tina Turner, icon-ing in stilettos. There was Madonna. There was Melanie Griffith, swapping sneakers for pumps as Tess McGill arrived\u2014in every sense of the word\u2014in Manhattan. There, a little later, was Julia Roberts, in Vivian Ward\u2019s thigh-high\u2014and toothpick-heeled\u2014patent-leather boots. There was Naomi Campbell, in her Vivienne Westwoods. There was Jennifer Jason Leigh, whose Hedra Carlson took the \u201clittle dagger\u201d on her feet to its murderously logical conclusion. There was Carrie Bradshaw, running on heels and then tripping on them. And there was Big, finally, proposing to her not with a ring, but with a diamond-encrusted pair of Manolos. And there, too, today, are Annalise Keating and Alicia Florrick and Claire Underwood and Selina Meyer, removing their heels and rubbing their aching feet after long days of bosslady-ing. There is Anne Hathaway\u2019s Andy Sachs, the heroine of The Devil Wears Prada, telegraphing her (d)evolution as a character through her willingness, and unwillingness, to wear stilettos. There is Hathaway\u2019s Catwoman, in a scene in 2012\u2019s The Dark Knight Rises, asked by a male adversary, \u201cDo those heels make it hard to walk?\u201d There she is, kicking him from behind and purring in reply, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Do they?\u201d\n\nT hey do. Just a little bit, but they do! Heels\u2019 failures as engineered footwear are precisely the reason Thesis Couture has more than 10,000 names on its waiting list: If heels can finally be made walkable\u2014not in a \u201cstanding around at a cocktail party\u201d way, but in a legitimate, \u201cliving one\u2019s life\u201d way\u2014then that changes their politics. \u201cThe high heel is a mutable object\u2014it is something that we simply assign meaning to,\u201d Semmelhack, the shoe historian, told me. And if you can take the hobble out of the heel, that in some sense reverses the meaning that hundreds\u2019 of years worth of history have assigned: heels as symbols, essentially, of a woman\u2019s copious capacity\u2014and, indeed, a woman\u2019s willingness\u2014to bear pain. And so while Thesis Couture\u2019s promise of comfortable stilettos\u2014informed by an intimate knowledge of what it means and feels like to walk in heels\u2014is premised on fashion, it is rooted, too, in feminism. (There\u2019s a reason Thesis nicknamed its first lookbook the \u201cTHE BOOK of LEGENDS,\u201d and a reason, too, that each of the 21 designs it presents\u2014the \u201cAmelia Earhart,\u201d the \u201cHua Mulan,\u201d the \u201cSerena Williams\u201d\u2014is named for a pioneering woman.) Thesis, through its emphasis on ergonomics and engineering, is fighting against the Louboutinian logic that has been with us, in some form, for centuries: the assumption that heels are feminine not in spite of all they demand of their wearers, but because of it. Kara Gordon / The Atlantic Singh and her colleagues, in other words, are hoping that their own contribution to the Heel Advice Industrial Complex will be to render all the tips and tricks that Michelle Phan and her fellow advice-offerers offer, finally, obsolete. The Thesis shoe is unsatisfied with Who What Wear\u2019s advice, say, to \u201ctape your third and fourth toes (counting from the big toe) together\u2014we recommend nude medical tape for a low-profile look, but Scotch tape works in a pinch\u2014to alleviate pain in the ball of your foot.\u201d And with America\u2019s Next Top Model\u2019s J. Alexander\u2019s suggestion that, when in heels, \u201cwhenever and wherever you can, sit, sit, sit!\u201d (and then: \u201ccross your legs so that all can see your beautiful, fashion-forward, painful footwear\u201d). And it is outright indignant with Bustle\u2019s conclusion that, if \u201cstretching out your shoes\u201d and \u201cusing Moleskin\u201d isn\u2019t enough to make walking in heels comfortable, then perhaps you should simply \u201cchange the way you walk.\u201d", "description": "A new company is bringing the engineering savvy of rocket science to the design of the high-heeled shoe.
