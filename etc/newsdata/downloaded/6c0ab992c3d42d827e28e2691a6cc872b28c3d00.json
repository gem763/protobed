Maybe RG III 2.0.\n\nAs starter Case Keenum was helping to hand the Chicago Bears their 31-15 win Monday night with three interceptions and two fumbles, the chants started in the crowd for the Lion King \u2014 Simba, otherwise known as Dwayne Haskins, the rookie first-round pick by the organization.\n\nThey continued in pockets throughout the game at Ghost Town Field. Then, in the post-game press conference, coach Jay Gruden was asked about considering making a change at quarterback \u2014 specifically, starting Haskins Sunday against the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium.\n\n\u201cNo, not really,\u201d Gruden answered. \u201cI think the most important thing is that we have some continuity. I can\u2019t change people every five minutes, and I have to give Case an opportunity playing with these new guys. This is his first time in this offense \u2026 I feel like Case has the tools to become a very efficient quarterback in this offense to get us some victories here moving forward.\u201d\n\nThe pressure to start Haskins began to build last week even before Keenum\u2019s upchuck performance Monday night, with the news that the Giants would be starting their prize rookie quarterback, Daniel Jones, last Sunday against Tampa Bay. Haskins himself turned up that pressure by tweeting \u201csheesh\u201d minutes after the news broke about Jones\u2019 start.\n\nThe two young quarterbacks have come to be linked in a narrative \u2014 again, driven by Haskins \u2014 when the Giants passed over Haskins with the sixth pick in the draft and selected Jones. \u201cThe league done messed up,\u201d he told ESPN on draft night.\n\nGruden might disagree with that. From various accounts, he and the coaching staff were higher on Jones than Haskins, and didn\u2019t want to select local Bullis School product with their 15th pick.\n\nBut owner Dan Snyder \u2014 whose son was a classmate of Haskins at Bullis \u2014 did want Haskins, no matter what the coaches wanted.\n\nGruden hasn\u2019t exactly warmed to the idea of Haskins seeing the field anytime soon. Gruden confirmed Monday in a conference call with reporters that Haskins has been working with the scout team, getting no first-team reps, which would appear to make him unprepared to step in anytime soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get him reps with the No. 1s because you don\u2019t have as much practice time this time of the year,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cDuring training camp and OTAs you can mix it up pretty equally, but when you\u2019re trying to get a starter ready to play in a game it is hard to get Dwayne a lot of those reps against the ones. What you\u2019re going to see is he is mainly doing scout team right now, but he is learning in the classroom \u2026 he just needs to continue to sit back and learn and continue to develop.\u201d\n\nSit back? I don\u2019t think that is what Snyder had in mind for his quarterback. Nor do I think Haskins, who was empowered by the owner before he ever walked into the Redskins locker room by agreeing to bestow Joe Theismann\u2019s No. 7 jersey to him, has much interest in sitting back \u2014 particularly after Jones\u2019s spectacular debut last Sunday, leading the Giants to a 32-31 comeback win over Tampa Bay, completing 23 of 36 passes for 336 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions.\n\nNot only, though, may Haskins have to sit \u2014 he may have to move to third chair.\n\nIf Gruden does decide at some point to make a change, or is forced to by injury, next man up at quarterback would likely be the coach\u2019s favorite, Colt McCoy \u2014 if they can keep the Redskins\u2019 medical staff away from him.\n\nMcCoy has been sidelined since last December when he suffered a broken leg in a 28-13 loss to Philadelphia. Since then, under the care of the team\u2019s celebrated medical staff, McCoy has had one setback after another trying to get back on the field after Gruden tried to rush him back for the season finale last year. But now he may be ready to resume practice.\n\n\u201cI think he (McCoy) might be able to take some individual tomorrow,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cAs far as the status when he does get back, I think we have to see a lot for him to get back in the lineup as far as his ability to push off and make the accurate throws and stand in the pocket. It is a little bit a ways away, but I\u2019ll be anxious to see him practice Thursday.\u201d\n\nAnd when pressed again on Haskins being the starter if a change is made from Keenum, Gruden himself suggested the next choice could be McCoy.\n\nI might point out that no one \u2014 save for me, Mrs. McCoy and Gruden \u2014 have likely ever chanted \u201cWe want Colt\u201d here.\n\n\u201cThis season is not lost. It\u2019s not over,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIf we feel like Dwayne gives us the best chance to win in a coming game, we\u2019ll definitely put Dwayne in there. If we feel like it\u2019s Colt when he gets healthy, it could be Colt. Right now, we feel like it\u2019s Case Keenum and we\u2019re going to move forward with him this week.\u201d\n\nThis is setting up as a showdown between Snyder and Gruden, in some ways similar to the first year Gruden arrived in 2014, when he tried to bench Griffin coming off injury after McCoy led Washington to a 20-17 upset overtime win over Dallas \u2014 the team\u2019s last win on \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d He was overruled by the owner and his imaginary friend, general manager and Prince of Darkness Bruce Allen.\n\nBack then, Gruden backed down. Now, though, possibly in his last days as the head coach of this franchise, Gruden doesn\u2019t seem interested in anyone\u2019s agenda but his own. Unlike Jim Zorn in his final days, I don\u2019t think that Jay Gruden is going to \u201ccomply.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
