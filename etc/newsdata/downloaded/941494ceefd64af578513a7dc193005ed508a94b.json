However, in some instances, this absurdity seems entrenched.\n\nLawlessness, counternarratives and deceitful assertions are the weapons of choice for those facing accountability and justice. This tendency is then refracted in the minds of those who are under their spell.\n\nIn desperation, \u201cwhataboutism\u201d has also become the defence strategy of apologists seeking to deflect attention away from those they sympathise with. Such a stratagem may yield some media attention, but it rarely sways judicial processes. It is plainly absurd.\n\nFor example, suspended SA Revenue Service (Sars) commissioner Tom Moyane is ensnared in disciplinary proceedings in which President Cyril Ramaphosa asserts a \u201cdeterioration in public confidence in the institution [Sars] and in public finances being compromised\u201d.\n\nAllegations levelled against Moyane include \u201cprofound lack of judgement\u201d; misleading Parliament; acting irrationally; and \u201cgross dereliction of duty\u201d. In short, Ramaphosa has lost confidence in the individual tasked with managing the nation\u2019s purse.\n\nA damning affidavit, deposed by former Sars commissioner and erstwhile finance minister Pravin Gordhan, undergirds Ramaphosa\u2019s allegations against Moyane.\n\nMoyane contends the \u201capparent oddity\u201d in that Ramaphosa has elected not to depose any affidavit himself, but relies on Moyane\u2019s former boss and nemesis\u2019 aversions.\n\nCompounding Moyane\u2019s woes are revelations of Sars\u2019 complicity in allegations of state capture. Strangely, Moyane\u2019s disciplinary proceedings run parallel to the commission of inquiry into tax administration and governance at Sars.\n\nIn fairness to Moyane, it would strain credulity to suggest that Ramaphosa, a complainant and initiator of both processes, couldn\u2019t conceivably comprehend the potential crossover of crucial testimony between Moyane\u2019s disciplinary hearings, an adversarial process, on the one hand, and the unfolding inquiry, an investigative process, on the other.\n\nNevertheless, Moyane needs to stop blaming \u201culterior motives\u201d and rebut damning testimonies.\n\nWhatever the reason, the timing and haste with which the inquiry was initiated \u2013 while the disciplinary process was under way \u2013 is unhelpful.\n\nRamaphosa has wisely acceded to submissions made to him by Moyane\u2019s legal team to consider suspending one of the processes, most likely the commission, until the conclusion of the disciplinary hearing, which is scheduled to wrap up much sooner.\n\nContrary to Moyane\u2019s claims, this is not a sign that Ramaphosa has blinked, but a sign of wisdom and strength. It is inconceivable that Moyane will survive the axe.\n\nHowever, therein could also lie the risk of the commission facing possible delays in the event that Moyane challenges any unfavourable outcomes in his disciplinary process.\n\nThe nexus between Moyane and his legal team\u2019s political associations is well established. This seems to be part of a grand strategy to portray Moyane as a victim of implied Ramaphosa and Gordhan plots aimed at ejecting Moyane from Sars.\n\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters, whose chairperson Dali Mpofu heads Moyane\u2019s legal team, has abandoned any pretence of disinterest in Moyane\u2019s legal woes.\n\nMeanwhile, Moyane has embarked on a tepid public relations exercise intended to deflect attention from the gravity of the charges he faces. Moyane\u2019s apparent lack of shame is only matched by the apparent nonchalance and petulance he has displayed throughout. Moyane has reportedly rejected Ramaphosa\u2019s offer to resign and spare further embarrassment and costs.\n\nAnother example involves former president Jacob Zuma\u2019s son Duduzane, who is shuttling between two courts over corruption and culpable homicide charges.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Duduzane\u2019s woes have also attracted political opportunists in our body politic. These quasi-revolutionaries, under the spell of the lunatic Black First Land First (BLF), use any tactics to subvert democratic processes and the pursuit of justice.\n\nThe BLF claims to be a vanguard for the downtrodden and opposed to a chimerical \u201cwhite monopoly capital\u201d.\n\nZuma junior is accused of stealing from the poor in cahoots with the Guptas and of causing the death of poor black women. The irony of Duduzane briefing white lawyers to defend him seems completely lost on the BLF.\n\nA double dose of irony is that the BLF castigates white supremacist organisation AfriForum for reaching out to the poor black families of the women allegedly killed by Duduzane\u2019s Formula 1 driving tendencies.\n\nMost of these incendiary theatrics are diversions intended to portray politically exposed culprits of malfeasance and general wrongdoing as victims of hidden forces and political subterfuge.\n\nLet us ensure public attention is not deflected from the need for Moyane and Duduzane to account for their transgressions. They are the architects of their own drama, and each deserves his own karma.\n\nOne of the most insidious phenomena arising out of unfolding public discourses is the conflation of legitimate pursuits of justice, with the banality of the pursuit of self-interests by quasi revolutionaries in our midst, often fuelled by their venal benefactors.\n\nIt would not be a good reflection on our democratic order when an individual, political party or fringe formation succeeds in having their narrow interests elevated above national interests.\n\nSadly, in some instances, this absurdity seems all but entrenched.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nLawlessness, counternarratives and mendacious assertions seem to be the weapons of choice by those facing accountability and justice. This phenomenon is refracted in the consciousness of those who are under its spell.\n\nYielding to apparent desperation, \u201cwhataboutism\u201d has also become the defense strategy by apologists seeking to deflect attention away from those they sympathise with. Such stratagem may yield some media attention, but it hardly ever sways judicial processes. It is plain absurd.\n\nLet us, for a moment, consider a duo of scenarios as I advance my argument.\n\nIn the first instance, suspended SA Revenue Service (SARS) commissioner Tom Moyane is ensnared in disciplinary proceedings in which President Cyril Ramaphosa asserts a \u201cdeterioration in public confidence in the institution [SARS] and in public finances being compromised.\u201d\n\nAllegations levelled against Moyane include \u201cprofound lack of judgement\u201d; misleading Parliament; acting irrationally and \u201cgross dereliction of duty\u201d.\n\nIn short, Ramaphosa has lost confidence in the individual tasked with lording over the nation\u2019s purse.\n\nA damning affidavit, deposed by former SARS commissioner and erstwhile finance minister Pravin Gordhan, undergirds Ramaphosa\u2019s allegations against Moyane.\n\nMoyane contends the \u201capparent oddity\u201d in that the complainant, Ramaphosa, has elected not to depose any affidavit himself, but relies on Moyane\u2019s former boss and nemesis\u2019 aversions.\n\nCompounding Moyane\u2019s woes are revelations of SARS\u2019 complicity in allegations of state capture, with some of these allegations deposed under oath in unrelated matters.\n\nStrangely, Moyane\u2019s disciplinary proceedings run parallel to the unfolding judicial commission of inquiry into tax administration and governance by SARS, headed by retired judge Robert Nugent.\n\nIn fairness to Moyane, it would strain credulity to suggest that Ramaphosa, a complainant and initiator of both processes ensnaring Moyane, couldn\u2019t conceivably comprehend potential crossover of crucial testimony between Moyane\u2019s disciplinary hearings, an adversarial process on the one hand, and the unfolding inquiry, an investigative process on the other.\n\nNevertheless, Moyane needs to disabuse himself from blaming \u201culterior motives\u201d and rebut damning testimonies adduced at the commission and his disciplinary hearing.\n\nWhilst it would be absurd to suggest political subterfuge by Ramaphosa is behind Moyane\u2019s woes, the timing and haste with which the inquiry was initiated \u2013 while the disciplinary process was underway \u2013 is unhelpful. This doesn\u2019t seem fair to Moyane though, nor does it advance the interests of justice.\n\nApropos, Ramaphosa has wisely acceded to submissions made to him by Moyane\u2019s legal team to consider suspending one of the processes, most likely the commission, until the conclusion of the disciplinary hearing which is scheduled to wrap up much sooner.\n\nContrary to Moyane\u2019s claims, this is not a sign that Ramaphosa has blinked, but a sign of wisdom and strength. Most legal pundits opine that it is inconceivable that Moyane will survive the axe.\n\nHowever, therein could also lie the risk of the commission facing possible delays in the event Moyane were to challenge any unfavourable outcomes pursuant the disciplinary process.\n\nMaking a determination either way is a litmus test for Ramaphosa\u2019s political resolve and dexterity.\n\nWeary and clearly exasperated members of the fourth estate have castigated Moyane and his legal team for adopting what they deem to be a \u201cStanlingrad\u201d defence strategy. Moyane\u2019s legal team vehemently deny this assertion.\n\nThe nexus between Moyane and his legal team\u2019s political associations is well established. This seems to be part of a grand strategy to portray Moyane as a victim of implied Ramaphosa and Gordhan\u2019s Machiavellian ploys aimed at ejecting Moyane from SARS.\n\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters, whose chairperson advocate Dali Mpofu heads Moyane\u2019s legal team, has abandoned any pretences of disinterest in Moyane\u2019s legal onslaught. Last Thursday, the party issued a statement\n\nMeanwhile, Moyane has embarked on a tepid public relations exercise intended to deflect attention on the gravity of the charges he faces, as he also elicits public sympathy \u2013 an absurd improbability!\n\nMoyane\u2019s apparent lack of shame is only matched by the apparent nonchalance and petulance he has displayed throughout. Moyane has reportedly rejected Ramaphosa\u2019s offer to resign with full emoluments, and thus spare himself and the public further embarrassment and costs.\n\nThe second instance involves former president Jacob Zuma\u2019s son, Duduzane, who currently shuttles between two courts over corruption and culpable homicide charges.\n\nUndoubtedly mimicking his moral exemplar dad, Duduzane\u2019s woes have also attracted political opportunists and sojourners in our body politic.\n\nThese quasi revolutionaries, under the spell of the lunatic Black First Land First (BLF), act like mutating genes that show up in both covert and overt tactics intended to subvert democratic processes and the pursuit of justice, most acutely within the black community.\n\nBLF claims to be a vanguard for the downtrodden and opposed to a chimerical \u201cwhite monopoly capital\u201d.\n\nZuma junior is accused of stealing from the poor in cahoots with the Guptas, as well as death of poor black females. The irony of Duduzane briefing white lawyers to defend him seems completely lost to BLF.\n\nA double dose of irony is that BLF castigates AfriForum, a white supremacist organisation, for reaching out to the poor families of the casualties of Duduzane\u2019s Formula1 driving tendencies on public road.\n\nBLF\u2019s misplaced hysteria and revolutionary voyeurism would be incomplete without customary invectives aimed at the Oppenheimers and the Ruperts.\n\nMost of these incendiary theatrics are plain diversions intended to portray politically exposed culprits of malfeasance and general wrongdoing as victims of chimerical forces and political subterfuge.\n\nScrounging around for \u201cprocedural unfairness\u201d and bias \u2013 were none exists \u2013 doesn\u2019t serve public interests, nor does it advance the pursuit of justice by victims Moyane and Duduzane\u2019s misdeeds.\n\nPublic attention will never be deflected away from the need for Moyane and Duduzane to account for their transgressions.\n\nMoyane and Duduzane are the architects of their own drama, and each deserves his own karma.\n\nTALK TO US\n\nAre Moyane and Duduzane\u2019s deflection tactics working?
