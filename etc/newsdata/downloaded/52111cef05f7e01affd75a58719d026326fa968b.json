Well, it\u2019s September, London Fashion Week is in full swing, and Victoria Beckham Beauty is finally here.\n\nThe \u201cdigital-first\u201d line launched on Saturday, allowing ample time for it to walk the runway at Beckham\u2019s Spring 2020 show Sunday and for us to discuss it now.\n\nFirst things first: VBB is more than a collection or a line. It\u2019s \u201ca clean and cruelty-free beauty movement that delivers inspiring, sophisticated, and streamlined essentials across makeup, skincare, fragrance, and wellness that fuel your life,\u201d according to a release. Together with co-founder and CEO Sarah Creal, Beckham designed the movement under the ethos of \u201cLuxury performance, clean beauty.\u201d\n\nThough the clean ingredients can\u2019t be felt through the screen, the messaging is already singing through the packaging. It features sleek compacts and pencils befitting a Spice of the Posh variety, but it\u2019s all done in sustainable ways: with minimal plastic; 100 percent postconsumer, recyclable, or biodegradable packaging and shipping materials; and orders delivered in reusable canvas pouches.\n\nYou can dip your toe into VBB with the brand\u2019s first launch: Victoria\u2019s Smoky Eye Wardrobe, which outfits you in everything you need to create VB\u2019s signature smoky eyes. This includes four curated shadow palettes called Smoky Eye Bricks ($54 each); four shimmery, crystal-infused Lid Lustres \u201cinspired by the healing and protective power of crystals\u201d Victoria surrounds herself with ($36 each); and three creamy Satin Kajal Liners ($26 each), one of which Victoria likes to line her waterline with (it\u2019s the bronze one).\n\n\u201cVictoria\u2019s signature smoky eye transcends time and occasion,\u201d a release reminds us, and with these tools crafted by the master herself, yours hopefully can and will, too. Stay tuned for the skin-care, fragrance, and wellness drops.\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Victoria Beckham just launched a beauty line, Victoria Beckham beauty, during London Fashion Week Spring 2020.
