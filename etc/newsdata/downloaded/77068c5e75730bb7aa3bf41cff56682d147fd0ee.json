Hepburn's Oscar - her third of four - was accepted on her behalf by her director Anthony Harvey.\n\nA tie had previously occurred in 1932 when Fredric March and Wallace Beery were both named best actor.\n\nMarch had actually received one more vote than Berry, but the rules at the time decreed a tie would be declared if any actor came within three votes of winning.\n\nThere have been four other ties in the history of the Academy Awards, though those all occurred in less prominent categories.\n\nThe most recent took place in 2013 when the best sound editing Oscar was shared between Skyfall and Zero Dark Thirty.\n\nEurovision Song Contest, 1969\n\nFor the first and only time in Eurovision history, the 1969 contest resulted in a four-way split.\n\nFrance, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom were all named winners after ending up with the same points tally in Madrid.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Lulu (far right) with the other winning singers and 1968 winner Massiel (centre)\n\nAt the time, each country had a jury consisting of 10 members who each awarded one point to their favourite song. An improbable turn of events led to four countries receiving 18 points each.\n\nSince there was no rule at the time to govern a tie, all four were declared winners and were invited to perform their respective winning songs.\n\nYears later, Lulu called the situation \"ridiculous\" but admitted she was \"so glad\" her Boom Bang-a-Bang song had been one of the top four.\n\n\"If I'd have been five I'd have been desperate,\" the Scottish singer told Australian talk show Today Extra in 2016.\n\nGolden Globes, 1988\n\nHistory was made twice at the 46th Golden Globe awards when two of its categories resulted in a three-way tie.\n\nJodie Foster, Shirley MacLaine and Sigourney Weaver all shared the award for best actress in a motion picture drama.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Weaver and Foster (left) shared their triumph with the absent MacLaine (right)\n\n\"I don't believe this,\" muttered Michael Douglas as he declared the result with his Fatal Attraction co-star Anne Archer.\n\nWeaver, for her part, said the award should have resulted in \"a five-way tie\". MacLaine did not attend the ceremony.\n\nThe prize for best actor in a comedy or musical TV series, meanwhile, was jointly awarded to Michael J Fox, Judd Hirsch and Richard Mulligan.\n\nEmpty Nest star Mulligan was the only one of the three on hand to accept his award in person.\n\nThere were three other two-way ties on one of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's more bonkers nights.\n\nBollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize, 2016\n\nThe judges of the UK's only literary award for comic literature couldn't decide between two of the 2016 nominees. So they decided to honour both.\n\nThat meant authors Paul Murray and Hannah Rothschild both had Gloucestershire Old Spot pigs named after their respective winning novels.\n\nIt was the first time the award - presented annually to the book (or books) deemed to best capture the comic spirit of PG Wodehouse - had been split between two winners.\n\nJurist James Naughtie said it had been \"impossible to separate\" Murray's The Mark and the Void and Rothschild's debut novel The Improbability of Love.\n\nPeter Florence, chair of the jury that chose to split this year's Booker Prize, is a founder judge of the Wodehouse Prize.\n\nCritics' Choice Awards, 2019\n\nEarlier this year, Glenn Close and Lady Gaga were both crowned best actress at the 24th annual Critics' Choice Awards.\n\nClose was recognised for her work in The Wife, while Lady Gaga was honoured for her performance in A Star is Born.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Glenn and Gaga celebrated their joint triumph backstage\n\n\"I was so thrilled [to tie] with Gaga,\" Close told reporters afterwards. \"Maybe one year everyone in the same category will all be up there together, because how do you choose?\"\n\nThis was actually the second tie of the night as the award for best actress in a TV movie or limited series was also bifurcated.\n\n\"I actually can't think of a more beautiful thing than a tie, because there really isn't a winner when we get to do such great work and we have such wonderful opportunities,\" said Amy Adams as she shared the stage with fellow winner Patricia Arquette.\n\nTies are relatively common at the Broadcast Film Critics Association's awards, though this was only the second time two occurred at the same ceremony.\n\nIt was a case of mixed emotions for Gaga, who rushed from the January ceremony to \"say goodbye\" to her dying horse Arabella.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
