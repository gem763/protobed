So it made sense for eminent climate scientists, such as James Hansen, Michael Mann, and Peter Kalmus, to sound the alarm about climate change .\n\n\u201cWhen climate scientists don\u2019t speak out, we\u2019re inadvertently sending a message that climate change isn\u2019t urgent\u201d, said Kalmus, a climate scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in a 2017 essay addressed to other climate scientists.\n\nBut when these scientists do speak out, are they having an impact on the public conversation?\n\nFew studies have examined how effective climate scientists are in influencing the public about climate change. However, other studies suggest that messages delivered by credible and trusted sources may be especially powerful. For example, one recent study found that when the Republican Party was connected to a state ballot measure on climate change, Republican support increased.\n\nAs scholars who study climate change and communication, we recently examined the effect of scientific information about climate change on public opinion to determine if messages attributed to climate scientists made a difference.\n\nOur study shows that climate scientists have relatively little impact on people\u2019s views. And it demonstrates how difficult it is to match the message and the messenger to an audience when the issues are complex and politically charged.\n\nWho Is a Trusted Source?\n\nWhile science is inherently uncertain, the science of climate change \u2013 and the role of humans in making it worse \u2013 is clear. Many climate controversies today are not about whether the climate is changing, but how should people change their behavior and the causes of climate change itself.\n\nDespite the certainties of climate science, Americans remain deeply divided along political lines about climate change.\n\nFor more than two decades, the scientific community has made efforts to inform the public about the scientific agreement of human-caused climate change and its impacts. At the same time, some politicians and advocates regularly call into question scientific evidence to reinforce doubts about climate change among Americans.\n\nWe decided to study who are the credible messengers who can influence climate opinions.\n\nWe designed a survey to learn if linking sources, or messengers, with specific types of threats associated with climate change would strengthen or weaken the impact of the message.\n\nRespondents were provided with one of two statements that emphasized the threat of climate change to either national security or the environment. Each statement was attributed to one of four sources (or to no source): military leaders, Republican Party leaders, Democratic Party leaders or climate scientists. Each source suggested that we \u201cpromote energy efficiency and renewable energy technology to substantially decrease our greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\n\nThe survey information also included suggestions to lower greenhouse gas levels.\n\nWe expected that climate scientists and military leaders would be especially effective sources when linked with an argument in their area of expertise. We also expected Republicans and Democrats to be most susceptible to information about climate change when it was delivered by a trusted leader particularly from their own political party.\n\nWho Is Convincing?\n\nOverall, the survey demonstrated that the least effective information source was climate scientists.\n\nStatements about climate change\u2019s effects on national security attributed to climate scientists decreased respondents\u2019 belief that climate change is happening and decreased support for laws to mitigate greenhouse gases.\n\nThey also reduced perceptions that a scientific consensus exists regarding human-caused climate change and reduced the belief that climate change is an environmental threat. Climate scientists as the source of the environmental message had the same impact as the information being attributed to no source at all.\n\nWe also evaluated partisan differences in responses. For Republicans, the most influential source of information was military leaders, particularly in the context of threats to national security. Republicans were also influenced by statements that were attributed to Republican Party leaders.\n\nIn this context, Republicans increased their belief that climate change is a threat to the environment, reduced their suspicion that climate science is politically motivated, and reduced the notion that climate change is a hoax.", "description": "Many climate controversies today are not about whether the climate is changing, but how should people change their behavior and the causes of climate change itself.", "authors": ["Risa Palm"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iQFNuNlh2CBJ3haZdKWquw--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/44b79d9115624c52d7e575dbe5550e52", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
