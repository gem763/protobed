Arato, denied their claims: 'The Raisens are not writers of \"Truth Hurts.\" They did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago.'\n\nThe brothers went further and shared a video to Instagram that overlapped Lizzo's vocals from Healthy and Truth Hurts singing the line. She sang 'I did a DNA test and found out I'm 100% that b****,' in a strikingly similar melody.\n\nLizzo's camp does agree that the writing session produced the 'DNA test' line. The dispute lies in who created the vocal line.\n\nLizzo's reps say she made it on her own, but the brother's say she tailored her voice to the line they created.\n\nBack in the day: Lizzo was seen in snaps fro man unknown time with the songwriters, in the video they posted comparing her vocals on the line in Healthy and Truth Hurts\n\nThe main fight: Though Lizzo's camp does agree that the Honey writing session produced the 'DNA test' line, but find difference is in who created the vocal line. Lizzo's reps say she made it on her own, but the brother's say she tailored her voice to the line they created\n\nThe Raisens' claim that they joined the singer and Saint John, and Yves Rothman to pen their track Healthy and that they were never contacted to have Healthy's music, lyrics or tempo used.\n\nJustin said 'It's not fair that we were not included,' and along with his brother say they suffered 'emotional distress' from the situation.\n\nThough they did praise Lizzo saying 'The last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo\u2019s momentum and movement as a cultural figure.'\n\nTruth Hurts was made eligible for the Grammy's, despite being released two years ago, and the singer is positioned as a likely candidate for Best New Artist.", "description": "Around the globe fans sang Truth Hurts' lyrics about lost love, and all too familiar romantic woes.
