ECB\u2019s Muller Joins Skeptics Seeing No Need to Resume Bond-Buying\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here.\n\nEuropean Central Bank policy maker Madis Muller joined the swelling ranks of officials skeptical over the need for a large stimulus package by saying a resumption of bond purchases now would be disproportionate to economic conditions.\n\nThe Estonian central-bank head signaled he is comfortable with cutting interest rates when the Governing Council meets on Sept. 12, but said the ECB can\u2019t be hostage to market expectations. Banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), Nomura, and ABN Amro predict a new round of quantitative easing, while investors are pricing in at least a 10 basis-point cut in the deposit rate.\n\nMuller, 42, said the economic outlook has worsened but there is no recession and the euro area isn\u2019t facing the deflation risk that would normally be a trigger for asset purchases. His resistance to major monetary easing puts him in the same camp as his German colleague Jens Weidmann, Dutchman Klaas Knot, Austria\u2019s Robert Holzmann and Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger, who have argued the central bank should turn to bond-buying only as a last resort.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a strong case for reactivating QE now,\u201d Muller, who joined the Governing Council in June, said in an interview in Tallinn on Tuesday. \u201cIn addition to being disproportionate in a situation where there is no deflation risk, in my opinion there is also a concern over ineffectiveness. It just might not be very productive.\u201d\n\nGrowing opposition to QE could spell trouble for President Mario Draghi, who has primed investors for some form of support for the economy as it\u2019s battered by trade tensions and Brexit. Bond purchases were capped at 2.6 trillion euros ($2.9 trillion) at the end of last year, and resuming them could require the ECB to raise self-imposed limits on how much it can buy. The rules are designed to prevent the central bank from breaching laws against financing governments.\n\nMuller showed reluctance to overstep the limits, saying \u201cabandoning them would be very difficult.\u201d\n\nLittle more than a week before it meets in Frankfurt, the Governing Council is clearly split on the way forward. Finnish central banker Olli Rehn argued last month that officials should deliver a significant stimulus package that overshoots market expectations. Vice President Luis de Guindos said investor bets should be treated with a \u201cpinch of salt,\u201d and Spain\u2019s Pablo Hernandez de Cos said all options should be kept on the table.\n\nSlovakia\u2019s Peter Kazimir has urged officials to reach as broad an agreement as possible for the institution\u2019s credibility.\n\nMuller said there is still room to cut rates further below zero, at the same time warning that the ECB should be wary of easing the pain for banks. Lenders suffer because the charge on their deposits squeezes their profit margin but Muller said any exemptions would undermine the stimulative effect of easing.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have the right to vote in September under a rota system that will also exclude French governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau and the central bank chiefs of Greece and Ireland. In practice, the Governing Council rarely resorts to a poll, aiming instead for consensus or unanimity.\n\nMuller said the ECB \u201ccan\u2019t share the responsibility for monetary policy with the markets\u201d and he \u201cwouldn\u2019t overemphasize\u201d the sentiment among investors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go to this meeting with an open mind,\u201d he said. \u201cOne can\u2019t have a definitive opinion before seeing the latest data and latest forecasts, but it seems that market expectations have gone too far.\u201d", "description": "ECB\u2019s Muller Joins Skeptics Seeing No Need to Resume Bond-Buying", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF0N0WI_L.jpg"}
