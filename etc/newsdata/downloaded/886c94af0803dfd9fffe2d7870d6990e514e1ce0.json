Business leaders, elected officials all across the political spectrum spending their time making up and telling bedtime stories that soothe us, that make us go back to sleep.\n\nThese are \u201cfeel-good\u201d stories about how we are going to fix everything. How wonderful everything is going to be when we have \u201csolved\u201d everything. But the problem we are facing is not that we lack the ability to dream, or to imagine a better world. The problem now is that we need to wake up. It\u2019s time to face the reality, the facts, the science.\n\nAnd the science doesn\u2019t mainly speak of \u201cgreat opportunities to create the society we always wanted\u201d. It tells of unspoken human sufferings, which will get worse and worse the longer we delay action - unless we start to act now. And yes, of course a sustainable transformed world will include lots of new benefits. But you have to understand. This is not primarily an opportunity to create new green jobs, new businesses or green economic growth. This is above all an emergency, and not just any emergency. This is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced.\n\nAnd we need to treat it accordingly so that people can understand and grasp the urgency. Because you can not solve a crisis without treating it as one. Stop telling people that everything will be fine when in fact, as it looks now, it won\u2019t be very fine. This is not something you can package and sell or \u201dlike\u201d on social media.\n\nStop pretending that you, your business idea, your political party or plan will solve everything. We must realise that we don\u2019t have all the solutions yet. Far from it. Unless those solutions mean that we simply stop doing certain things.\n\nChanging one disastrous energy source for a slightly less disastrous one is not progress. Exporting our emissions overseas is not reducing our emission. Creative accounting will not help us. In fact, it\u2019s the very heart of the problem.\n\nSome of you may have heard that we have 12 years as from 1 January 2018 to cut our emissions of carbon dioxide in half. But I guess that hardly any of you have heard that there is a 50 per cent chance of staying below a 1.5 degree Celsius of global temperature rise above pre-industrial levels. Fifty per cent chance.\n\nAnd these current, best available scientific calculations do not include non linear tipping points as well as most unforeseen feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas escaping from rapidly thawing arctic permafrost. Or already locked in warming hidden by toxic air pollution. Or the aspect of equity; climate justice.\n\nSo a 50 per cent chance - a statistical flip of a coin - will most definitely not be enough. That would be impossible to morally defend. Would anyone of you step onto a plane if you knew it had more than a 50 per cent chance of crashing? More to the point: would you put your children on that flight?\n\nAnd why is it so important to stay below the 1.5 degree limit? Because that is what the united science calls for, to avoid destabilising the climate, so that we stay clear of setting off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control. Even at 1 degree of warming we are seeing an unacceptable loss of life and livelihoods.\n\nSo where do we begin? Well I would suggest that we start looking at chapter 2, on page 108 in the IPCC report that came out last year. Right there it says that if we are to have a 67 per cent chance of limiting the global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, we had, on 1 January 2018, about 420 Gtonnes of CO2 left to emit in that carbon dioxide budget. And of course that number is much lower today. As we emit about 42 Gtonnes of CO2 every year, if you include land use.\n\nWith today\u2019s emissions levels, that remaining budget is gone within less than 8 and a half years. These numbers are not my opinions. They aren\u2019t anyone\u2019s opinions or political views. This is the current best available science. Though a great number of scientists suggest even these figures are too moderate, these are the ones that have been accepted by all nations through the IPCC.\n\nAnd please note that these figures are global and therefore do not say anything about the aspect of equity, clearly stated throughout the Paris Agreement, which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale. That means that richer countries need to do their fair share and get down to zero emissions much faster, so that people in poorer countries can heighten their standard of living, by building some of the infrastructure that we have already built. Such as roads, hospitals, schools, clean drinking water and electricity.\n\nThe USA is the biggest carbon polluter in history. It is also the world\u2019s number one producer of oil. And yet, you are also the only nation in the world that has signalled your strong intention to leave the Paris Agreement. Because quote \u201dit was a bad deal for the USA\u201d.\n\nFour-hundred and twenty Gt of CO2 left to emit on 1 January 2018 to have a 67 per cent chance of staying below a 1.5 degrees of global temperature rise. Now that figure is already down to less than 360 Gt.\n\nThese numbers are very uncomfortable. But people have the right to know. And the vast majority of us have no idea these numbers even exist. In fact not even the journalists that I meet seem to know that they even exist. Not to mention the politicians. And yet they all seem so certain that their political plan will solve the entire crisis.\n\nBut how can we solve a problem that we don\u2019t even fully understand? How can we leave out the full picture and the current best available science?\n\nI believe there is a huge danger in doing so. And no matter how political the background to this crisis may be, we must not allow this to continue to be a partisan political question. The climate and ecological crisis is beyond party politics. And our main enemy right now is not our political opponents. Our main enemy now is physics. And we can not make \u201cdeals\u201d with physics.\n\nEverybody says that making sacrifices for the survival of the biosphere - and to secure the living conditions for future and present generations - is an impossible thing to do.\n\nAmericans have indeed made great sacrifices to overcome terrible odds before.\n\nThink of the brave soldiers that rushed ashore in that first wave on Omaha Beach on D Day. Think of Martin Luther King and the 600 other civil rights leaders who risked everything to march from Selma to Montgomery. Think of President John F. Kennedy announcing in 1962 that America would \u201cchoose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard\u2026\u201d\n\nPerhaps it is impossible. But looking at those numbers - looking at the current best available science signed by every nation - then I think that is precisely what we are up against.\n\nBut you must not spend all of your time dreaming, or see this as some political fight to win.\n\nAnd you must not gamble your children\u2019s future on the flip of a coin.\n\nInstead, you must unite behind the science.\n\nYou must take action.\n\nYou must do the impossible.\n\nBecause giving up can never ever be an option.", "description": "My name is Greta Thunberg, I am 16 years old and I\u2019m from Sweden.
