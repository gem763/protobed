It sparked a children\u2019s hospital fundraiser.", "language": "en", "text": "His wish was granted. And then some. King says he had been sent more than $27,000 by Tuesday night \u2014 a number that continues to grow \u2014 and his once-humorous endeavor has transformed into a fundraiser for a local children\u2019s hospital, backed by major brands, including Busch.\n\n\u201cI was completely overwhelmed, I didn\u2019t think anything like this would have a chance to happen,\u201d King said Tuesday. \u201cEspecially when Busch commented. I was at a loss for words.\u201d\n\n\u201cCollege GameDay\u201d was broadcasting from Ames, Iowa, on Saturday as No. 18 Iowa faced unranked Iowa State. The game had personal significance for King, who attended Iowa State but is taking time off from school to work. The school, he noted, has \u201ca notoriously not good football program.\u201d Even though he now lives about 45 minutes away in Altoona, King and his friends drove up for \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d to \u201cshow how great the fans were and show the country Iowa is no joke.\u201d\n\nGeorgia fans organize last-minute \u2018pink-out\u2019 to honor Arkansas State coach\u2019s late wife\n\nKing said he brought his sign along on the off chance he appeared on TV. But his strategic positioning near a stage paid off, and within half an hour of holding up the poster he received more than $400 in contributions. As hundreds of dollars became thousands, King realized he had a chance to do \u201csomething a little more special than buy Busch Light.\u201d\n\nAfter consulting with his family, King pledged to donate his earnings (sans about $15, for one case of beer) to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital. As his friends and relatives spread the message, the contributions to his Venmo multiplied. They kept coming in Monday, and by Tuesday afternoon, Busch Beer and Venmo took notice, each offering to match his donation to the hospital.\n\nKing\u2019s account will remain open for donations until the end of the month.\n\n.@CarsonKing2 this is the best thing we have read all year, we\u2019re inspired.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re going to match your donation to University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics, and we\u2019ll throw in some of that Busch Light you were looking for. https://t.co/NPPrPp6zJg \u2014 Busch Beer (@BuschBeer) September 17, 2019\n\nWe see a lot of great stories, but this is one of our favs @CarsonKing2. Count us in for matching the donation to the hospital, too. #ftk\ud83d\udc9b@BuschBeer @CollegeGameDay https://t.co/thS8JXOXC3 \u2014 Venmo (@venmo) September 17, 2019\n\nAs attention to King\u2019s poster-turned-charity reached its zenith, he said some of his friends wondered why he\u2019d opted against holding on to some of the money. He works on the rapid response team at Prairie Meadows Casino, after all \u2014 why not spend it there?\n\nFor King, the answer was obvious.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a better purpose for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids deserve everything they can get. If I can give it to them, I\u2019m going to give it to them.\u201d\n\nKing called the hospital Monday morning and introduced himself.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d a receptionist exclaimed, according to King. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to talk to you!\u201d\n\nBoth parties have since come up with a plan: King will visit at the end of the month, where he\u2019ll receive a tour of the facility and meet some of the children the funds will benefit. He\u2019ll carry with him a check.\n\nAnd this time, the paper he wields won\u2019t be a joke at all.\n\nRead More:\n\nMaryland\u2019s new indoor football facility, set to be finished next year, brings program up to speed\n\nVirginia\u2019s Tony Bennett turns down pay raise, instead pledges $500,000 to career program\n\nKent State ended a women\u2019s field hockey game for football fireworks.
