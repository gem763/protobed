Duncan Middle School in Palm Beach Gardens, posted on Twitter a photo his daughter took of the question, with President Trump being one of the four choices (the others being Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan).\n\n\u201cThis was an actual question on my daughters middle school test today. Furious. Going to raise some hell,\u201d he wrote earlier this week.\n\nThis was an actual question on my daughters middle school test today. Furious. Going to raise some hell with the principle. Indoctrination will not continue. (See word \u201cidiot\u201d at the end of our presidents multiple choice answer).

Among the glowing or neutral descriptors were \u201cfirst national health care (Affordable Care Act),\u201d \u201cUS economy back on track,\u201d \u201cWon Nobel Peace Prize in 2009\u201d and \u201cfocused foreign policy on terrorism.\u201d\n\nPart of the Quizlet study set\u2026 pic.twitter.com/p67YsSfdwK \u2014 Cam Cary (@CamCamcary) September 25, 2019\n\nAccording to a report Thursday in the Orlando Sentinel, the Palm Beach County School District had started an investigation and in the meantime reassigned the teacher who gave the quiz.\n\nThe school\u2019s principal also apologized to the parents in writing, the Sentinel reported.\n\n\u201cThe question was inappropriate, and demonstrated an unacceptable lack of good judgment on the part of the teacher,\u201d principal Phillip D\u2019Amico wrote.\n\nIn a tweet Thursday, Mr. Cary, an outspoken supporter on Twitter of Mr. Trump, said he was satisfied with how things had progressed in recent days but warned of teachers and their unions indoctrinating children in public schools.\n\n\u201cSo far the school has been responsive and cooperative. Teacher is reassigned while the investigation is under way. Several teachers have reached out to me with support as they are also tired of this. It\u2019s systemic. Unfortunately they have to remain anonymous or face repercussions.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
