Deliverr declined to comment on the company\u2019s current valuation or annual revenue.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company, part of a growing ecosystem of logistics providers for e-commerce retailers, plans to use the funding to expand its fast shipping services across major sales channels and marketplaces. It also plans to add more warehouse partners to its network and hire more staff at its operations center in Chicago.\n\nDeliverr was founded in 2017 and now has 50 employees in offices in San Francisco, Chicago and Toronto.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe company orchestrates order fulfillment for merchants selling via Walmart Inc., Amazon.com Inc., eBay Inc. and Shopify Inc. through a network of 16 U.S. warehouses that allow delivery of many items in two days or less. Deliverr\u2019s technology integrates with those platforms and lets sellers tag items with special badges that denote shipping times and whether items qualify for programs such as Amazon Prime, which can boost merchants\u2019 rankings in search results.\n\nThe growth of e-commerce has fostered a field of technology-driven startups and fulfillment operators that aim to help retailers and online brands meet Amazon-era consumer expectations for speedy delivery.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Fulfillment by Amazon program for marketplace sellers generally ships items from its warehouses in Amazon-branded boxes, for example, while eBay and Shopify have recently rolled out services where merchants use their platforms to allocate, store and ship inventory through networks of third-party logistics providers.\n\nDeliverr\u2019s main customers are merchants who typically sell $1 million or more of merchandise on Amazon and other sales channels, shipping their orders through a combination of Fulfillment by Amazon, their own warehouses and, in some cases, garages, co-founder Michael Krakaris said in an interview.\n\nDeliverr\u2019s technology uses algorithms and data to allocate inventory across different points in its network and decide the best shipping method to ensure items arrive on time. On Tuesday Deliverr expanded its Shopify program to allow merchants to offer two-day delivery nationwide and next-day delivery to one-quarter of the U.S. Sellers on the platform now have access to dynamic badging, so that consumers see a countdown clock showing how much longer they have to buy something for it to arrive in two days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really focused on how we can help merchants sell more,\u201d Mr. Krakaris said. \u201cIt\u2019s convincing them to go beyond Amazon, to go to Walmart, or to set up your own store\u2026 For all those channels you want to be on the fastest shipping program.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "description": "E-commerce fulfillment technology startup Deliverr Inc. raised a $23 million funding round to hire more engineers and other staff as it scales up its fast fulfillment programs for online sellers, the company said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith", "Jennifer.Smith Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109986/social", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
