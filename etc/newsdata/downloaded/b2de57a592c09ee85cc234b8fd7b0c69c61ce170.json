Ilhan Omar some background on Walmart CEO\u2019s biography", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s been a banner week for Rep. Ilhan Omar. Her (completely false) tweet about a 9-month-old who \u201cdied\u201d in Texas because of President Trump\u2019s policies is still up, she penned on op-ed opposing economic sanctions even though she supports the BDS movement, and then she voted \u201cpresent\u201d on a resolution to recognize the Armenian genocide and was the lone Democrat voting against sanctions on Turkey.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. She also has her eye on capitalism here in America, and a piece on CNBC about what CEOs make inspired her to rail against the \u201cmoral outrage\u201d of Walmart\u2019s pay scale.\n\nWalmart CEO\u2019s salary last year: $23,618,233\n\nA Walmart worker\u2019s median pay last year: $21,952 The issue isn\u2019t that these employees aren\u2019t working hard enough. It\u2019s that our system doesn\u2019t value workers. And it\u2019s a moral outrage. https://t.co/Jg13KF8uFr \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 29, 2019\n\nDana Loesch both pitched in to let Omar know that Walmart\u2019s CEO didn\u2019t just walk into the job one day.\n\nYou do realize that they do different things, right? https://t.co/nAgBjfMR3J \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) October 29, 2019\n\nThis is like saying \u201cI was a server at Houlihan\u2019s during college and I didn\u2019t make as much as the CEO. The issue is that workers aren\u2019t valued.\u201d \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) October 29, 2019\n\nBTW \u2014 the current CEO of Walmart, Doug McMillon, started with the company unloading trucks when he was a teenager. He didn\u2019t believe that he was entitled to a CEO\u2019s pay, he worked his way up and earned it. \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) October 29, 2019\n\nHe went to college and pursued Walmart management and ended up managing a store. He then went on as a buyer and merchandiser before, nearly 30 years later, finally making CEO. That\u2019s the American dream \u2014 earning it, not demanding it just because. \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) October 29, 2019\n\nIf you want something, work for it. Earn it. No one owes you a thing. If that offends you then you don\u2019t want it badly enough. And when Omar demands that all her constituents make her exact salary then I\u2019ll take her socialist beliefs more seriously. \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) October 29, 2019\n\nThank you! I am so tired of this comparison. \u2014 The Pickled Squirrel (@cirrus1701) October 29, 2019\n\nWhat if we compare her salary with those same workers? Maybe she can donate some of her salary to them? I\u2019m sure they work harder than she does. \u2014 Marissa \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@rissy17) October 29, 2019\n\nDon't confuse her with facts. \u2014 Charysted (@Charysted) October 29, 2019\n\nAnd as a bonus, here\u2019s Carol Roth:\n\nWalmart's CEO-who started as a teen unloading trucks-is responsible for 2.2 million employees. If you divided up ALL his pay between employees evenly, it\u2019s less than $11/employee per year\u2013 less than $1/month. His pay isn't affecting theirs. This is envy politics at its worst. https://t.co/G4q5MBKUPL \u2014 Carol Roth (@caroljsroth) October 30, 2019\n\nMarkets literally value work for what its worth\u2013 if your experience, skills, etc. are worth more, someone will pay you more. \u2014 Carol Roth (@caroljsroth) October 30, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "Rep.
