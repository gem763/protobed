However, NII was down 2.7% against the previous quarter.\n\nIn an attempt to offset the impact of increasing competition on financial margins, Spanish banks are focusing on cutting costs.\n\nBankia is shifting its focus from a mostly mortgage loan book to a more profitable consumer and enterprise business. It expanded its net loan book by 0.4% in the first nine months.\n\nAt the end of September, Bankia's core Tier-1 capital ratio, the strictest measure of solvency, was 13% compared to 12.91% at the end of June.\n\n($1 = 0.9019 euros)", "description": "Spain's Bankia third-quarter net profit slumps 23% on higher provisions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9R0CX_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
