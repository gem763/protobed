There won\u2019t be any deal unless the US finds some way to walk back its efforts to keep China\u2019s top telecommunication firm Huawei out of world markets. The summary dismissal today of National Security Adviser John Bolton increases the prospects of a deal, although the immediate motivation for Bolton\u2019s departure most likely lies elsewhere.\n\nChina and the United States seemed on track for a trade deal in early December 2018 when XI Jinping and Donald Trump dined on the sidelines of a summit meeting in Buenos Aires \u2013 except that Canada arrested Huawei CFO Meng Wangzhou at the Vancouver Airport. Trump didn\u2019t know about the arrest, but his national security adviser John Bolton did, as Bolton later said in a radio interview.\n\nA few weeks earlier, the US government began a campaign to persuade its allies to exclude Huawei from the rollout of 5G broadband networks, as the Wall Street Journal first reported Nov. 23, 2018. The Meng Wanzhou arrest, the first use of extraterritorial powers in the case of an alleged sanctions violation, was a declaration of war on the Chinese national champion. In the ensuing months, the United States banned US technology firms from supplying components and software to Huawei and demanded that its allies boycott its 5G network systems.\n\nAll of the presidential orders targeting Huawei were drafted by Bolton\u2019s staff at the National Security Council offices in the Executive Office Building next to the White House. Trump\u2019s national security adviser didn\u2019t devise the campaign against Huawei, but he represented the views of the US intelligence community to the White House and helped formulate the rationale for the effort to derail Huawei\u2019s market leadership. Huawei, the US government alleged, might build secret back doors into its routers and steal data, compromising the cybersecurity of any country it supplied. So dangerous was Huawei, US officials alleged, that the US might cut back on intelligence sharing with such countries.\n\nThis in my view was a willful deception on the part of America\u2019s spies, intended to distract attention from a different sort of problem. I do not believe that Ambassador Bolton set out to deceive anyone, but it seems likely that he was captured by the intelligence community\u2019s agenda. As I wrote in Asia Times July 7:\n\nThe US intelligence community\u2019s alarm at Chinese leadership in 5G mobile broadband has less to do with a threat of Chinese eavesdropping than with the likelihood that electronic eavesdropping will become next to impossible, thanks to quantum cryptography. I have had a number of conversations on the topic with US as well as Chinese sources, but this conclusion appears obvious from public sources.\n\nAmerica\u2019s intelligence community spends nearly $80 billion a year, including $57 billion for the National Intelligence Program and $20 billion for the Military Intelligence Program. Signals intelligence (SIGINT), mainly electronic eavesdropping, takes up the lion\u2019s share of the budget. Among other things, the National Security Agency recorded more than half a billion calls and text messages of Americans in 2017.\n\nIn response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Security Agency admitted \u2013 for the second time \u2014 that it improperly eavesdropped on Americans. The spooks\u2019 ability to tap the conversations of prospective terrorists, foreign leaders like Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and pretty well anyone it wants is a source of enormous power as well as justification for continued funding.\n\nIn the meantime, America\u2019s efforts to suppress Huawei have taken on a life of their own. In the Wall Street Journal today, financier George Soros, a bitter political enemy of President Trump, demanded to know if Trump will \u201csell out the US on Huawei\u201d by including the technology issue in an overall trade deal. Soros wrote, \u201cChina is a dangerous rival in artificial intelligence and machine learning. But for now it still depends on about 30 U.S. companies to supply Huawei with the core components it needs to compete in the 5G market. As long as Huawei remains on the entity list, it will lack crucial technology and be seriously weakened\u2026 However, President Trump may soon undermine his own China policy and cede the advantage to Beijing.\u201d\n\nI do not think that the ban on exports of US components to Huawei will slow down its efforts in 5G broadband. With few exceptions, these components are easily sourced elsewhere, and China has had a blank check program to eliminate dependence on US technologies since March 2018, when the US banned sales of handset chips to China\u2019s ZTE.\n\nStill, it is odd to find the liberal Mr. Soros attacking President Trump, as it were, from the right. The US Establishment wants to throw whatever monkey-wrenches it has into the works in the hope of delaying Huawei long enough to figure out what it wants to do next. It doesn\u2019t appear to be working. Last week Deutsche Telekom became the latest European country to inaugurate 5G networks using Huawei equipment.\n\nMorris Lore reports at lightreading.com, \u201cBefore Deutsche Telekom\u2019s 5G launch, Three, Vodafone and BT-owned EE had all turned on Huawei-built 5G networks in the UK, despite government indecision on the future role of Chinese suppliers. Vodafone is also using Huawei\u2019s equipment to support 5G services in Italy, Romania and Spain, explaining why it has been Europe\u2019s most vociferous opponent of the anti-Huawei campaign. Elsewhere, Huawei is live in Switzerland and Finland, where it equips Sunrise and Elisa respectively.\u201d\n\nTo America\u2019s great embarrassment, the whole of Eurasia has ignored its imprecations against Huawei. Bolton\u2019s high-profile campaign, joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has failed, and President Trump doesn\u2019t like to fail.\n\nBolton is quite the China hawk. In January 2018, three months before he took office, he argued in the Wall Street Journal that the US should station troops in Taiwan. China is glad to see the back of him. Global Times editor Hu Xijin tweeted, \u201cBolton has never played a positive role on China issues either, although it won\u2019t be the reason why he was fired. I believe people who hold extreme political stance are paranoid and difficult to get along with. The news of Bolton being fired likely drew applause in the White House.\u201d\n\nJust what form a trade-and-technology deal might take is far from clear. The US cannot simply let the Huawei matter drop, but it might agree to comprehensive testing and screening of Huawei products. Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei told New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman that Huawei is \u201copen to sharing our 5G technologies and techniques with US companies so that they can build up their own 5G industry.\u201d He added that American companies can \u201cchange the software code. In that case, the US will be assured of information security.\u201d\n\nIn short, Huawei has offered to call the American bluff about its purported data theft and open its proprietary technology to American inspection. The intelligence community and the China hawks, in general, will not like that, and Bolton\u2019s departure removes one hawk from a particularly important nest.\n\nMy view is that Huawei\u2019s dominance of a game-changing technology does indeed present a threat to the United States, but that John Bolton\u2019s weasel war dance won\u2019t do the United States any good. If the US wants to maintain technological superiority, it has to create national champions that can best Huawei, and that requires a massive commitment of federal R&D funding. In the meantime, President Trump may have to compromise with China to avoid a recession and defeat in the 2020 elections.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Asia Times.", "description": "President Trump needs a trade deal with China as quickly .10/02/2019 13:14:24PM EST.", "authors": ["David P.
