On Wednesday the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid forward will be able to put that worry aside for the time being as her team played out a draw in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie.\n\nDuggan, who left City in 2017 to play for Barcelona for two years before moving to Alt\u00e9tico for the start of this season, had at least 20 tickets for her friends and family to watch her team pick up a potentially important away goal.\n\nCity, who would have been looking to banish the memories of last year, when Atl\u00e9tico knocked them out in the last 32, cannot yet breathe easy. Atl\u00e9tico looked promising despite having had to deal with a change of manager just seven days ago as Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1nchez Vera resigned for personal reasons, to be replaced by Pablo Lopez Salgado until the end of the season.\n\nIt was a dangerous start for Manchester City as they almost gave a penalty away, but instead Gemma Bonner came away with a yellow card for her challenge on Ludmila Da Silva as the contact started just outside the box.", "description": "Manchester City 1 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 1", "authors": ["Sophie Penney"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000213234789-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bql_-dn_bkBoeGShbklIuDGiATUoVmv_XQtM6PFyzMefw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
