Bernie Sanders, who is seeking to rebound from a heart attack that has clouded the future of his candidacy and the leftist political movement he has built over decades.\n\nSanders (I-Vt.) has been sidelined since he was rushed to a hospital on Oct. 1, and the nearly three-hour showdown in Westerville, Ohio, will mark his return to the campaign. An audience of millions \u2014 including some wondering whether Sanders has the stamina for one of the world\u2019s most grueling jobs \u2014 is expected to tune in, and many of his supporters will be watching anxiously.\n\nSanders is not the only candidate facing high stakes, as this is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry into President Trump jolted the Democratic race. Former vice president Joe Biden faces questions about his son\u2019s role in Ukraine, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has moved into first place in some polls, making her a newly tempting target, according to many Democrats.\n\nBut Sanders, 78, may have the most riding on the debate, sponsored by CNN and the New York Times, as scrutiny of his age and endurance are greater than at any point in his nearly half-century political career. A strong performance could help calm the doubts about his prospects as the oldest candidate in the field, while a weak showing could deal a devastating blow to a campaign that was already slipping.\n\nWarren\u2019s same-sex marriage quip captures what some find exciting \u2014 and others distressing \u2014 about her\n\n\u201cI certainly expect that there are a lot of people who will question his age \u2014 even more than that question may have been raised before,\u201d said Wayne Moynihan, a New Hampshire state representative who has endorsed Sanders. \u201cIt makes absolutely no difference to me, but I do recognize that it probably means something to someone else.\u201d\n\nThe senator from Vermont\u2019s performance has other implications for a fluid primary that has changed substantially since the last debate on Sept. 12. Both Biden and Warren would love to pull supporters away from Sanders, who has a loyal base of active devotees.\n\nOver the weekend, Sanders hinted at his plans. His campaign announced he would hold his first rally since his heart attack on Saturday in New York City. And in an interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos,\u201d Sanders, who often brushes aside questions about his differences with Warren, noted that she identifies strongly as a capitalist and he does not.\n\nAll this makes it the most consequential debate so far, and it will feature a few wild cards. Billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer is making his debate debut. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) has threatened to boycott the event. And with a dozen participants, it could become chaotic as candidates seek to break through the din.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of candidates on the stage with something to prove,\u201d said Democratic strategist Rebecca Katz. \u201cBiden has to prove that he is the most electable. Bernie has to prove that he is in as good a shape as ever. And Warren has to not mess up.\u201d\n\nFor Sanders, the personal and political pressures of the past two weeks have been extraordinary. He was hospitalized in Las Vegas after experiencing chest pains at an Oct. 1 campaign event. Doctors inserted two stents to clear blocked artery, though the campaign did not initially disclose that he\u2019d suffered a heart attack.\n\nJust days later, Sanders\u2019s daughter-in-law passed away from cancer at the age of 46. All this was happening after the senator was maintaining a breakneck campaign pace amid a growing threat from Warren\u2019s rise.\n\nWhile Sanders is by nature a private person when he campaigns, he has opened up a bit since the heart attack. He released a seven-minute direct-to-camera video on Thursday that touched on his experience in the hospital while tying it to Medicare-for-all, an approach advisers hope Sanders continues.\n\nSen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.), a Biden supporter, said he recently spoke with Sanders. He wished Sanders a speedy recovery and the two discussed the death of his daughter-in-law, Casey recalled. Despite the tough circumstances, \u201che sounded great,\u201d Casey said.\n\nOn a conference call last week, Sanders thanked top campaign officials and told them to take care of their own health, according to Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream, who serves as a Sanders campaign co-chair. Sanders said he plans to get back on the campaign trail and that his doctors predict a full recovery, Cohen said.\n\n\u201cI think the debate is an incredible opportunity for Bernie to reinvigorate his campaign,\u201d Cohen said in an interview. Others who have spoken with Sanders say the signature elements of his personality \u2014 dry humor, an interest in policy and a strong desire to campaign \u2014 are coming through.\n\nNew revelations about Trump test Pelosi\u2019s narrow impeachment strategy\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, though, whether Sanders will heed the advice of confidants who want him to publicly open up about his heart attack, at the debate and beyond. Before an earlier debate, advisers urged Sanders to sharply criticize Biden\u2019s relationship with his donors, but he shied away from a full-on attack. And at the campaign\u2019s outset, aides pressed Sanders to talk more about his personal story, but he soon dropped those efforts.\n\nThe bigger question may be whether following his heart attack, Sanders can convince enough primary voters that his age and health should not disqualify him from a hard-fought race against an aggressive Trump, let alone a job running the country. Many Democrats, while sympathizing with Sanders, suggested his physical well-being is reasonable for Democratic voters to consider.\n\n\u201cI feel terrible for Sen. Sanders. My heart goes out to him,\u201d said Steve Westly, a California investor who is fundraising for Biden. \u201cBut let\u2019s be honest: He\u2019s 78 years old. When you are that age, you really want to be looking vibrant, healthy. You just, you can\u2019t have people thinking you're old, tired, and likely to have serious health issues.\u201d\n\nWestly added, \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to put a good spin on that one.\u201d\n\nYet Biden himself is 76. And questions about age and health might extend to candidates beyond Sanders on Tuesday, particularly Biden and Warren, who is 70. Like Sanders, they have agreed to release their health records before the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 3.\n\nSince he was discharged from the hospital, Sanders has repeatedly said he feels great. He has taken walks with his wife, Jane, and he played baseball with his grandchildren as he recuperated at home in Burlington, Vt.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Sanders said his cardiologist, whom he started seeing after his heart attack, said his recovery is going \u201cvery, very well.\u201d Asked how severe his heart attack was, Sanders would not answer directly, saying he was told that \u201cwe are on the road to a full recovery\u201d and \u201cwithin the next month, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nHis Democratic rivals have so far been diplomatic regarding Sanders\u2019s condition, wishing him a speedy recovery and voicing confidence he will bounce back. But they have been privately preparing to deal with potential questions from moderators about the subject on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cWhat a tough time for him \u2014 genuinely,\u201d said Steyer, adding that he had called Sanders. \u201cBetween him having a health incident and then losing his daughter-in-law ... I think that must be so hard. And I really just wanted to send best wishes to him, and that\u2019s all I really did.\u201d\n\nAsked whether an episode like a heart attack should factor into voters\u2019 choices, Steyer praised Sanders but did not answer directly.\n\nYounger candidates pushing a message of generational change \u2014 such as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 37, and former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, 47 \u2014 will also appear onstage, creating the potential for a lively discussions of age.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of the free world, it\u2019s arguably the most stressful job, and we have to make sure our candidate is ready,\u201d said Michael Tubbs, the mayor of Stockton, Calif. A Democrat who voted for Sanders in 2016 and is currently undecided, Tubbs said age and health are fair questions for all candidates. \u201cYou want your president there for all four years,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden and Warren are likely to face scrutiny on other fronts during the debate, strategists said. Congressional Democrats have embarked on an impeachment inquiry following revelations that Trump pressed the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump and his allies have launched attacks on Biden that are unfounded but that some Democrats worry will nevertheless take a toll on his candidacy. And even some Democrats question why Hunter was serving on the board of a Ukrainian firm while his father was the Obama administration\u2019s point man on Ukraine. They wonder whether the furor will affect Biden\u2019s electability, which is his main appeal for many Democrats.\n\nBiden, for his part, plans to challenge Trump in the debate, according to a person familiar with his strategy, and argue that the president is trying to handpick his 2020 opponent.\n\nWarren has been steadily climbing in the poll prompting more scrutiny of her left-leaning policies, including her support for Medicare-for-all and how it would affect middle-class taxes. Buttigieg called her explanation \u201cextremely evasive\u201d in a recent interview with CNN.\n\nWhen it comes to Sanders, several of his prominent friends and supporters have advocated cutting back on his schedule when he plunges back into campaigning. Sanders, whose campaign calendar has been much fuller than most of his rivals\u2019, has sent mixed signals about what it will look like after Tuesday.\n\nAfter initially telling reporters that \u201cwe\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit\u201d by \u201cprobably not doing four rallies a day,\u201d Sanders reversed himself the next day, saying in an interview with NBC News that he \u201cmisspoke\u201d and \u201csaid a word I should not have said.\u201d But the following day, he told to CNN that he probably will not be holding four rallies a day right away.\n\n\u201cI think for him and his family, yes, you\u2019d like to see him hold fewer events because his message has gained traction without him,\u201d said Kelley Monahan, the register of deeds in Grafton County, N.H., and a Sanders supporter.\n\nSanders\u2019s campaign has faced questions and criticism for waiting more than two days before revealing publicly that he had a heart attack, another subject that could come up at the debate. He and his campaign have defended the decision to disclose only limited information at first.\n\nPerhaps above all else on Tuesday, it will be critical for Sanders to be self-assured, many Democrats say.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s all about confidence,\u201d said Rufus Gifford, a former ambassador to Denmark who served as finance director on Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign and has donated to some of Sanders\u2019s rivals. \u201cIf he's not a hundred percent on his game, it becomes more challenging for him.\u201d", "description": "Bernie Sanders has been off the campaign trail since his recent heart attack.
