As he recounts in his memoir, \u201cLong Way Home,\u201d a Drug Enforcement Administration agent told him he could either be taken out the front door, kicking and screaming, or, \u201cfor your family\u2019s sake, we can take you out the back way, put you in a car.\u201d\n\nThe subject of family permeates Douglas\u2019s book, which Knopf will release on Tuesday, and it remains prominent in his life, even after he served almost eight years in prison for possessing heroin and selling drugs.\n\nHe is the oldest son of Michael Douglas, the Academy Award-winning actor and producer, and a grandson of Kirk Douglas, the venerated \u201cSpartacus\u201d star. Though the thought of living up to either one of their reputations would seem paralyzing, Cameron Douglas made it clear in an interview last month that he did not expect anyone\u2019s sympathy for squandering his privileged upbringing.\n\nNor did he blame the burden of his surname for sinking him into a mire of hard drugs, crime and punishment. \u201cThere was nothing anybody could do to get through to me at a certain point,\u201d he said. His voice was tentative, and though he has been a free man since 2016, he spoke like someone who was still getting used to seeing daylight on a regular basis.", "description": "In his memoir \u201cLong Way Home,\u201d Michael Douglas\u2019s oldest son examines the \u201cdemented death wish\u201d that drove him to drugs and crime, shining a light on his famous family along the way.", "authors": ["Dave Itzkoff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/19/books/19Douglas1/19Douglas1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
