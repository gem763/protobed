There was no indication as to whether this information had been passed on to the police, it adds.\n\nXavier Dupont de Ligonnes, pictured with wife Agnes, 48, was subject to an international arrest warrant for the 2011 killings in a mystery that transfixed France\n\nHe was said to have gone 'on the run' after the bodies of Agnes, 49, and children Arthur (left), 20, Thomas (right), 18, Anne, 16, and Benoit, 13, were found buried in the garden of the family house in Nantes, western France, along with their two pet Labradors\n\nHe is suspected of shooting his family dead and burying them under the terrace of their elegant townhouse in the western city of Nantes. Pictured left is Anne, 16. Right: Benoit, 13\n\nThe bodies of Arthur, Thomas, Anne and Benoit (pictured) aged 13 to 20 years were found in the garden of their house on April 21, 2011\n\nHe was said to have been using a passport belonging to a man called Guillaume Joao. Mr Joao's home in Limay, in the Yvelines department, 40 miles from Paris, was raided by police.\n\n'Mr Joao looks nothing like De Ligonn\u00e8s, and nor was the man who was arrested in Glasgow,' said a French investigating source.\n\n'It may be that De Ligonn\u00e8s has radically disguised himself over the years, but there are still lots of questions to be answered.\n\n'The digital fingerprint identification was only partial - that's why French forensics experts are on their way to Glasgow. DNA tests are already in progress.'\n\nThe De Ligonn\u00e8s suspect has remained silent since his arrest, while Pierre Senn\u00e8s, the Nantes prosecutor, has called for 'prudence'.\n\nBarriers placed at the front of a house in Limay, north-west of Paris, which is said to be the home of the man arrested late October 11 at Glasgow Airport\n\nXavier Dupont de Ligonnes, pictured right in the garden of his Nantes house in August 2003 (left: His wife Agnes)\n\nRelatives and friends attend a funeral ceremony outside the church of Saint Felix, in the French western city of Nantes, on April 28, 2011, in memory of the Dupont de Ligonnes family\n\nThis file photograph taken on April 14, 2012, shows people laying down flowers in front of the Dupont de Ligonnes family's house as part of a silent march in the streets of Nantes, western France\n\n'Checks are being carried out to see if it really is Mr De Ligonn\u00e8s,' Mr Senn\u00e8s explained.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Goldstein, a lawyer for De Ligonn\u00e8s's sister, Christine, who believes he is innocent of the murders, said: 'We are waiting for scientific confirmation that he is indeed Xavier Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s'.\n\nAnother investigating source said: 'He did not try and resist arrest, but information corresponded with what is on a Europol search card. It is now being double checked.'\n\nTwo French sources close to the investigation said the aristocratic businessman was said to have been stopped at Glasgow airport on Friday after arriving on a flight from Paris.\n\nThe sources confirmed a fingerprint match had been made but one said a DNA analysis was being conducted to be 'totally sure' it was him.\n\nAnother source said Dupont de Ligonnes was travelling on a stolen French passport and had likely spent part of his time on the run in Britain.\n\nPeople hold the coffin of a member of the Dupont de Ligonnes family during the funeral\n\nA police officer stands in front of the residence in Limay, Yvelines on October 12, 2019\n\nThe suspect 'remains in police custody in connection with a European Arrest Warrant issued by the French Authorities', a Police Scotland spokeswoman said\n\nHe is suspected of shooting his family dead and burying them under the terrace of their elegant townhouse in the western city of Nantes.\n\nTheir bodies were found three weeks after the killings, during which time Dupont de Ligonnes reportedly told his teenage children's school he had been transferred to a job in Australia.\n\nHe is said to have told friends he was a US secret agent who was being taken into a witness protection programme.\n\nFrench prosecutors have said he killed all five of his victims in a 'methodical execution', shooting them each twice in the head at close range with a weapon fitted with a silencer.\n\nHe is believed to have covered them in quicklime and wrapped them in sheets before burying them under concrete.\n\nEarlier on Friday, officers had picked out the suspect at the French capital's Charles de Gaulle airport, but there was not enough time to seize him, so they alerted British police, who confirmed an arrest had been made.\n\nThe man 'remains in police custody in connection with a European Arrest Warrant issued by the French Authorities', a Police Scotland spokeswoman said earlier.\n\nIn this file photo taken on April 22, 2011 French Police officers stand guard in front of the Dupont de Ligonnes family house in Nantes, western France after French authorities issued an international search alert for Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes\n\nToday: The house where Xavier Dupont De Ligonnes is suspected of having killed his wife and his four children eight years ago\n\nA picture showing Benoit Dupont de Ligonnes, one of the five Dupont de Ligonnes family members, set in front of their house, where they were discovered in April 2011\n\nFrench newspaper Liberation reported o suspicions that Dupont de Ligonnes had undergone plastic surgery, citing police sources, because his appearance had changed.\n\nFor years France has been gripped by the question of how Dupont de Ligonnes had disappeared without trace, with some suggesting he may have killed himself. Hundreds of reported sightings only added to the mystery.\n\nIn 2015, a letter and photo of two of his sons, signed with his name and the message 'I am still alive', was delivered to an AFP journalist but experts could not verify its authenticity.\n\nThe alleged killer evaded a police dragnet in the Var region of southern France in January last year after witnesses reported seeing a man resembling him near a monastery.\n\nHundreds of people take part in a march on April 26, 2011 in the French western city of Nantes, in memory of the five Dupont de Ligonnes family\n\nThe alleged killer evaded a police dragnet in the Var region of southern France in January last year after witnesses reported seeing a man resembling him near a monastery (pictured: Nantes, April 2011)\n\nEuropol is the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation which has helped in the eight-year hunt for De Ligonn\u00e8s (pictured: Police hunt De Ligonn\u00e8s in the south of France)\n\nYesterday evening French media outlets reported that De Ligonn\u00e8s had been arrested at Glasgow Airport following a flight from Paris.\n\n'He was travelling under a false identify and had changed his appearance completely,' said an investigating source.\n\nThis file photograph taken on April 23, 2011, shows a police seal on the front door of Dupont de Ligonnes' family home in western French city of Nantes\n\n'He did not try and resist arrest, but information corresponded with what is on a Europol search card. It is now being double checked. He is now in the hands of Scottish police.'\n\nEuropol is the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation which has helped in the eight-year hunt for De Ligonn\u00e8s.\n\nLast year police searched underground caves and abandoned potassium mines in the area around Roquebrune-sur-Argens, in the south of France, where De Ligonn\u00e8s was spotted by a CCTV camera in April 2011.\n\nHe had fled Nantes a few days earlier after neighbours reported not having seen any of the family for more than three weeks.\n\nDetectives who visited initially found a severed leg under the garden terrace, and then uncovered the bodies of those who had been killed.\n\nDe Ligonn\u00e8s originally came from Versailles, home of the pre-Revolutionary kings and queens of France, and was technically a count who could trace his lineage back generations.\n\nA police seal on the front door of Dupont de Ligonnes' family home in Nantes after French authorities issued an international search alert\n\nThe suspect had been arrested at Glasgow Airport following a flight from Paris\n\nIn confiscated emails he said that he considered himself to be part of a Roman Catholic elite which was superior to 'the masses'.\n\n'I think I've got a superiority complex, you could call it that,' he wrote. 'But it's based on a simple observation: I belong to a group of people who are intelligent, determined, balanced and in good moral and physical health. Such people are rare compared to the masses.'\n\nRecalling his strict, devout childhood, De Ligonn\u00e8s added: 'All my adolescence was devoted to religion and faith, under the influence of my grand-mother and mother. To such an extent that I did not rebel like other adolescents, nor indulge in drugs or run after girls.'\n\nDe Ligonn\u00e8s was last seen on April 15 2011 when he left a budget hotel at Roquebrune-sur-Argens, abandoning his car there.\n\nHe was wearing a backpack as he strolled through a car park into the surrounding countryside, and was picked up by a camera.\n\nAn extensive search was carried out in the area between April and June 2011 and - acting on new information \u2013 police resumed it last year, but found nothing.\n\nPeople lay down flowers in front of the Dupont de Ligonnes family's house as part of a silent march on April 14, 2012 in the streets of Nantes, western France\n\nFrench authorities have been searching for Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s without success ever since the bodies of his wife, Agnes, and four children - Arthur, Thomas, Anne and Benoit - were discovered (pictured: French police hunting de Ligonn\u00e8s in April 2011)\n\nThere was a theory that De Ligonn\u00e8s may have committed suicide in the days after the slaughter, in which case police were searching for remains of his body.\n\nHowever, prosecutors had never ruled out the possibility that De Ligonn\u00e8s was living rough, or else is being hidden by members of his extended family, who own country homes around France.\n\nDe Ligonn\u00e8s's ancestors, who included the 19th Century poet Lamartine, originally lived in a southern province of France called the Rouergue.\n\nFive months before the murders, De Ligonn\u00e8s said he had inherited a .22 rifle from his father and started target practice at a Nantes shooting club.\n\nReceipts found in his house also reveal that he bought a silencer, as well as a spade, a two-wheel trolley, chalk lime, and other equipment which could have been used to bury the bodies.\n\nIt also emerged that De Ligonn\u00e8s, who ran a number of internet businesses, had severe financial difficulties.\n\nAccording to Scottish police the arrested man's 'digital fingerprints' correspond to that those recorded for De Ligonn\u00e8s, French media reported.", "description": "Glasgow police arrested a man thought to be Xavier Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s when he arrived at Glasgow Airport on Friday afternoon.
