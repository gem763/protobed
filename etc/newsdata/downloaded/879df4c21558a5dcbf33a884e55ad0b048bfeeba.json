Purdue and the Sacklers have admitted no wrongdoing.\n\nYes, but: Many states are preparing separate lawsuits against the Sacklers, arguing that the settlement is insufficient to help those struggling with addiction and that Purdue's bankruptcy is a maneuver to protect the Sacklers' wealth.\n\nWhere it stands: North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein told Axios he is filing a lawsuit against the Sacklers in state court \"imminently.\" More will follow.\n\n\"Purdue is a carcass of a drug company,\" Stein said. \"The value is with the Sackler family. They should not get the benefit of protection from bankruptcy courts.\"\n\nBetween the lines: A major sticking point is what the Sacklers specifically will pay, considering they have taken out Purdue's assets over the years.\n\nThe Sacklers would pay $3 billion toward the tentative settlement, and possibly another $1.5 billion if a separate Purdue subsidiary is sold at a certain price. But Stein said all, not some, of the restitution from the Sacklers should be guaranteed.\n\nThe Sacklers have siphoned billions more dollars from Purdue into a complex web of offshore tax havens and trusts, the AP recently reported.\n\nAs one example, one of the trusts that owns Purdue is registered in a British territory off the coast of France, according to the bankruptcy filing.\n\nGo deeper: Purdue's bankruptcy filing", "description": "North Carolina is ready to sue the Sacklers separately.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/AZWXBh2Xjfjz4-rBrBr4ZwC0jCM=/0x0:4032x2268/1920x1080/2019/09/16/1568654418131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
