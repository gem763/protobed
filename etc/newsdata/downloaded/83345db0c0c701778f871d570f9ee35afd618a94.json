Two career State Department officials are the latest scheduled witnesses to be deposed in the accelerating inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nA Democratic-led panel is expected to vote Wednesday afternoon to advance the resolution, which sets the parameters of the public phase of the Trump impeachment inquiry. The White House is planning to invite a group of Republicans to meet with Trump before the Thursday roll call, hoping to rally the troops.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Republicans have been highly critical of the process, Trump is urging his allies to defend him on the substance of the allegations against him. He argues he did nothing wrong during the July call in which he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\n\u25cfTwo volatile meetings at the White House have become central to the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\n\u25cfA firsthand account of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call puts the GOP in a bind, emboldens Democrats.\n\n\u25cfSenate Democrats question Russia ambassador pick about Ukraine, impeachment.\n\n6 p.m.: Extended impeachment sparks concerns about disruptions to Democratic presidential primary\n\nAD\n\nHouse Democrats increasingly expect their impeachment effort to stretch well past Thanksgiving, possibly forcing a Senate trial into January or later \u2014 a timeline that could disrupt the final weeks of campaigning before the party starts to choose its nominee.\n\nHouse leaders had initially hoped to hold a floor vote before the Nov. 28 holiday so the Senate could hold a trial before Christmas.\n\nAD\n\nBut the surprising number of witnesses agreeing to testify behind closed doors has extended the timeline and sparked a debate about whether prolonged impeachment proceedings are politically prudent.\n\nSome Democratic strategists have raised concerns that an extended process that bridges the holiday season risks losing the nation\u2019s attention or lending credence to Republican claims that Democrats have been distracted from bread-and-butter issues such as health care and job creation that they focused on in the 2018 election.\n\nAD\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Michael Scherer and Mike DeBonis\n\n4:15 p.m.: House committees seek testimony from Bolton in impeachment inquiry\n\nAD\n\nLawmakers want to question Bolton about his frustration with Trump\u2019s allies, including Giuliani, who were pressing Ukraine to investigate Democrats, according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid.\n\nThe committees want Bolton to testify behind closed doors on Nov. 7.\n\nLawmakers have also asked two National Security Council staffers, John Eisenberg and Michael Ellis, to testify on Nov. 4.\n\n\u2014 Karoun Demirjian and Rachael Bade\n\n4:10 p.m.: House Rules Committee debates impeachment inquiry resolution\n\nMembers of the House Rules Committee debated the proposed procedural rules for impeachment, with Democrats maintaining that the next stage will be open and Republicans arguing that the process does not provide the president with sufficient due process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis process determining whether he should be impeached will be open to public view, just as it should be,\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), the panel\u2019s chairman, said as the hearing opened.\n\nHe later added: \u201cWe want to get to the truth. \u2026 We are genuinely horrified by the lack of cooperation by the White House.\u201d\n\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) accused Democrats of not living up to their promises of openness.\n\n\u201cIn my view, it\u2019s not a fair process, it\u2019s not an open process, and it\u2019s certainly not a transparent process,\u201d he said.\n\n3:35 p.m.: Judge sets Kupperman hearing for Thursday\n\nA federal judge has scheduled for 4 p.m. Thursday a hearing on the case of former Trump national security aide Charles Kupperman, who has sued asking the courts to decide whether he must comply with Congress\u2019s subpoena or a White House order not to testify in an impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe hearing had initially been set for 3 p.m. The Department of Justice asked to move it to Friday because of a conflict with the hearing about the testimony of former White House counsel Donald McGahn. But U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon agreed only to move the hearing by one hour.\n\n\u2014 Spencer S. Hsu and Ann E. Marimow\n\n2:55 p.m.: Republican leaders keeping an eye on Rooney\n\nWhile senior Republicans and White House officials speculated Wednesday that they would have zero Republican defections in Thursday\u2019s House vote on the impeachment inquiry, it\u2019s not absolutely solid that would be the case.\n\nIn particular, Republican leaders have been keeping a close eye on Rep. Francis Rooney, a retiring Florida Republican who has found the testimony in the impeachment depositions disturbing. Rooney has refused to rule out voting for impeachment but has not said how he will vote Thursday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a number of conversations with some members who were wavering a little bit, and I think we\u2019ll probably get that number down to zero,\u201d said one Republican aide familiar with the effort.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) have been telling uncertain Republicans that vote for the inquiry would effectively be greenlighting an unfair process that doesn\u2019t give Trump due process.\n\nDemocrats, however, crafted the resolution specifically to try to undercut that argument, ensuring that Trump can have an attorney represent him during certain proceedings. But Republicans continue to say the process is unfair \u2014 particularly because the House Judiciary Committee has the power to cut the president\u2019s attorneys out of the process if they feel they are acting in bad faith, Republicans say.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Rachael Bade\n\n2:45 p.m.: White House, GOP leaders try to keep Republicans in line ahead of impeachment vote\n\nTrump, White House officials and House GOP leadership have been working behind the scenes to keep party members corralled ahead of Thursday\u2019s critical vote on impeachment procedures, according to multiple Republican officials, hoping to present a unified front against the Democratic effort to oust Trump.\n\nSenior administration officials and Republican leaders have been huddling with members behind the scenes, ensuring that moderate Republicans or those who have criticized Trump in the past will not break away.\n\nA senior administration official said the White House\u2019s legislative affairs team and other top officials has been reaching out to members since Monday when Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced the vote. They\u2019re currently planning to invite a group of Republicans to meet with Trump before the Thursday roll call, hoping to rally the troops.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has also kept in close contact with Republican leaders, this person said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in good shape. We\u2019re on a strong trajectory \u2026 I think we\u2019ll be pretty unified,\u201d said a senior administration official who requested anonymity to speak frankly. \u201cThe question is: What Democrats is [Pelosi] having to work on? Is she having to flip people from no to yes?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, House Democrats have also been touching base with moderates from swing districts that could vote against the resolution. At least one, Rep. Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.), has said he will vote against the impeachment procedures.\n\nDemocrats do appear more likely to have defections than Republicans at this point. While a handful of moderate Democrats have grumbled about voting for the impeachment resolution, not a single Republican has said he or she intends to break with their own party \u2014 at least not as of early Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u2014 Rachael Bade\n\n2:20 p.m.: Anderson has arrived for closed-door deposition\n\nChristopher Anderson, the second of two State Department officials scheduled to testify on Wednesday, has arrived at the Capitol for his deposition.\n\nAnderson will detail efforts when U.S. officials tried to demonstrate support for Ukraine only to be batted down by the White House, including after Russian forces attacked and seized Ukrainian military vessels in the Sea of Azov in 2018, according to prepared remarks.\n\n1:45 p.m.: Schiff says he agrees with Trump on substance over process\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said he agrees with Trump that the focus of the impeachment investigation should be on substance.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump tweeted that Republicans were \u201cstarting to go after the Substance\u201d more than what he termed a very unfair process and urged them on.\n\n\u201cTrump has urged Republicans to focus on the substance in the impeachment inquiry, not the process,\u201d Schiff tweeted. \u201cI can confirm our focus will continue to be on the President\u2019s own words and misconduct. Glad we all agree.\u201d\n\n1 p.m.: Gaetz files ethics complaint against Schiff\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a key Trump ally in the impeachment fight, announced Wednesday that he is filing an ethics complaint against House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who is leading the inquiry.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the secure room where depositions take place, Gaetz said the complaint stemmed in part from Schiff\u2019s opening statement at an Intelligence Committee hearing last month.\n\nDuring his remarks, Schiff presented an embellished version of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. At the time, Schiff said he was conveying \u201cthe essence\u201d of what Trump had relayed to Zelensky. Schiff later said it was meant as a parody, something that he said should have been apparent to Trump and others who have been critical.\n\n\u201cHe acted in a way that was not consistent with House rules and not consistent with House ethics,\u201d Gaetz said.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly cited the episode as he has railed against the House-led inquiry.\n\nGaetz also cited an episode earlier this month in which he attempted to enter a deposition and was removed by Schiff because he does not sit on one of the three committee leading the inquiry.\n\nIn his complaint, Gaetz argues that under House rules, a vote should have been required to close the deposition to lawmakers who do not serve on the committees.\n\nIn a letter to the leaders of the House Ethics Committee, Gaetz says that after the panel \u201cthoroughly investigates\u201d Schiff, it should make \u201cappropriate referrals to the Department of Justice, for further investigation and prosecution.\u201d\n\nPatrick Boland, a spokesman for Schiff, responded to the news late Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think anyone takes Mr. Gaetz seriously, especially on the subject of ethics,\u201d Boland said.\n\n12:25 p.m.: Trump campaign video seizes on 2020 Democrats\u2019 calls for impeachment\n\nTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted a link to a video Wednesday featuring footage of the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nThe video then transitions to footage of Trump claiming at a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rally that Democrats \u201cwant to erase your vote like it never existed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to erase your voice, and they want to erase your future. But they will fail because in America, the people rule again,\u201d Trump says at the rally. He adds: \u201cThe only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3, 2020.\u201d\n\nRather than pivoting away from the topic, Trump has spoken and tweeted extensively about the impeachment inquiry since it was launched by Democrats last month \u2014 and the campaign\u2019s latest video is a continuation of that trend. In a recent two-week span, the president tweeted about impeachment more than 250 times, decrying the process as a \u201cscam\u201d and a \u201choax.\u201d\n\n11:15 a.m.: DNC raising money in solicitation that highlights impeachment inquiry\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is seeking to raise money with a new solicitation that highlights the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn a letter on behalf of the DNC, Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) seeks money to help keep Democrats in Republican-leaning districts like hers in office.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t run for Congress to impeach the president,\u201d she says in the solicitation. \u201cI ran to advocate for working families, fight back against Big Pharma and outrageous prescription drug pricing, and help families alleviate the crushing costs of child care. However, I cannot ignore my duty to defend our Constitution. That is why I, after careful deliberation, joined my Democratic House colleagues in support of an impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nHer rationale for seeking contributions: \u201cDonald Trump and his powerful allies have shown us they\u2019ll stop at nothing to win reelection and pry front line Democrats like me out of office \u2014 and the DNC is hard at work making sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\n11 a.m.: Sullivan says he received no answer on why Trump had lost confidence in Yovanovitch\n\nJohn Sullivan, Trump\u2019s nominee to be the next U.S. ambassador to Russia, faced questions from senators Wednesday about the administration\u2019s approach to Ukraine and the ouster of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nSullivan, who serves as the deputy secretary of state, was the official who told Yovanovitch that she was being recalled from her post in Kyiv in May.\n\nSullivan said Wednesday that he had told Yovanovitch last year that he thought she had served admirably, before later being directed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to tell her she was being recalled early because Trump had lost confidence in her.\n\n\u201cDid you ask why?\u201d Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) asked.\n\n\u201cI was told that he had lost confidence in her \u2014 period,\u201d Sullivan replied.\n\nSullivan also told a story about his late uncle, William Sullivan, who was the last U.S. ambassador to Iran until then-President Jimmy Carter lost confidence in him over policy differences.\n\nSullivan said the tale illustrates that when a president loses confidence in an ambassador, it\u2019s time for the ambassador to come home.\n\nMenendez responded that given his uncle\u2019s experience, he hopes Sullivan would have spoken up more loudly in defense of Yovanovitch. \u201cThat\u2019s the essence of being an ambassador\u201d \u2014 keeping Foreign Service officers abroad insulated from political consequences, Menendez said.\n\n10:40 a.m.: Croft appearing under subpoena\n\nCatherine Croft, one of two career diplomats expected to testify Wednesday, is appearing under a subpoena, according to an official working on the impeachment inquiry spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss closed-door proceedings.\n\n\u201cIn light of an attempt by the White House and State Department to direct Catherine Croft not to appear for her scheduled deposition, and efforts to also limit any testimony that does occur, the House Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena to compel her testimony this morning,\u201d the official said, adding that Croft is fielding questions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers and staff.\n\n10:15 a.m.: McConnell says House resolution falls \u2018way short\u2019\n\nAs the House moves toward a Thursday vote on proposed procedural rules for impeachment drafted by Democrats, key Republicans are lodging objections, arguing they do little to provide the due process that Trump deserves.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in floor remarks Wednesday that the Democratic procedures \u201cfall way short\u201d of the standard demanded in a presidential impeachment.\n\n\u201cAny such inquiry must be conducted by the highest standards of fairness and due process, but thus far this time around, instead of setting a high bar, House Democrats seem determined to set a new low,\u201d he said.\n\nThe resolution, McConnell added, \u201cdoes not confer on President Trump the most basic rights of due process or seemingly alter [Chairman Adam B. Schiff\u2019s] unfair process in the House Intelligence Committee in any way whatsoever.\u201d\n\nHe summed up the Democratic resolution this way: \u201cNo due process now, maybe some later, but only if we feel like it. Well, that\u2019s not even close to fair.\u201d\n\nThe resolution released Tuesday and an accompanying set of Judiciary Committee rules contain procedures for public hearings in the Intelligence Committee, to be managed largely at Schiff\u2019s discretion, and grant Trump and the GOP minority rights to rebut Democrats and potentially present evidence of their own in the Judiciary panel. The measure is set to be debated in the House Rules Committee Wednesday and forwarded to the House floor for a Thursday morning vote.\n\nIn a separate briefing for reporters on the Democratic resolution, House Republican aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal views said GOP lawmakers and aides have deep concerns about a \u201cbifurcated process\u201d that gives Schiff and the Intelligence Committee the lead role, with the Judiciary Committee playing a subsequent role in receiving its findings and potentially writing articles of impeachment.\n\nThe Democratic rules, the aides said, do not give the president due-process rights during the Intelligence Committee portion of the probe, and the rights set out for the Judiciary Committee portion are extended largely at the discretion of Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). They expressed particular alarm at a provision that gives Nadler the power to deny Republican requests so long as the White House is resisting Democratic subpoenas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re including this to try to give themselves an excuse if they don\u2019t want to grant the president due process,\u201d one aide said.\n\nAnother aide cast doubt on whether Democrats intend to grant Trump his rights, noting that granting GOP requests could extend the proceedings well beyond the year-end deadline many Democrats have been informally discussing.\n\n\u201cIf you actually follow through with all these procedures, it does not jibe with the timeline Democrats say they are trying to stick to,\u201d the second aide said.\n\n\u2014 Mike DeBonis\n\n10 a.m.: Schumer seeks protection of Vindman after Tuesday\u2019s testimony\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) is calling on the Army to provide Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who testified Tuesday in the impeachment inquiry, the same protections as whistleblowers.\n\nIn a letter, Schumer also asked Army leaders that Vindman be \u201cprotected from reprisal for testifying before Congress.\u201d\n\nVindman told House investigators Tuesday that his concerns about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky drove him to notify his superiors because he feared Trump was undermining national security.\n\nVindman was among the White House officials who listened in on the July 25 call.\n\nSchumer noted that in the hours since Vindman\u2019s testimony, he has been \u201cvilified by individuals in the media and elsewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough he has served our country for more than 20 years and is a recipient of the Purple Heart after being injured while serving in Iraq, he has been called a variety of derogatory terms and some have even gone so far as to call him a spy and question his loyalty to the United States.\u201d\n\nSchumer said the attacks are \u201coutrageous and unacceptable.\u201d\n\nHe asked Army leaders for a briefing on what actions the Army is taking to ensure Vindman and others are being protected.\n\n9:55 a.m.: RNC chairwoman highlights possible Democratic opposition to resolution\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel on Wednesday highlighted a report about one House Democrat \u2014 and possibly more \u2014 potentially voting against a resolution setting the parameters for the next stage of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cEven some House Democrats are seeing right through Pelosi\u2019s partisan resolution,\u201d McDaniel tweeted. \u201cThey know it\u2019s still going to be a process that\u2019s unfair to @realDonaldTrump.\u201d\n\nHer tweet linked to a news story that quoted Van Drew saying, \u201cI would imagine that I\u2019m not voting for [the resolution].\u201d\n\nThe report mentioned several other Democrats who have hedged about their support for an inquiry.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), an ally of Pelosi in House leadership, said that he is confident that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of Democrats will support the resolution.\n\n9 a.m.: Trump renews attack on Vindman\n\nTrump returned to Twitter to renew his attack on Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a top National Security Council official who testified Tuesday, as a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d\n\nVindman, an Army combat veteran and Purple Heart recipient, told House investigators that his concerns about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky drove him to notify his superiors because he feared Trump was undermining national security.\n\nVindman was among the White House officials who listened in on the July 25 call.\n\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s Never Trumper witness could find NO Quid Pro Quo in the Transcript of the phone call,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThere were many people listening to the call. How come they (including the President of Ukraine) found NOTHING wrong with it. Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nTrump has previously said \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d \u2014 a term denoting Republicans who oppose him \u2014 are \u201chuman scum.\u201d\n\n8:50 a.m.: First of two witnesses arrives at Capitol\n\nCatherine Croft, one of two career diplomats expected to testify Wednesday, has arrived at the Capitol for her closed-door deposition.\n\nCroft, who worked on Ukraine issues at the White House and the State Department, will say that \u201cthroughout\u201d her time in the Trump administration she heard the president \u201cdescribe Ukraine as a corrupt country,\u201d both \u201cdirectly and indirectly,\u201d according to her prepared remarks.\n\n8:30 a.m.: Democrats voice concerns about potential government shutdown amid impeachment inquiry\n\nDemocrats are increasingly expressing fears that Trump could let the government shut down as a distraction from the impeachment inquiry.\n\nWithout passage of a short-term spending bill signed by Trump, the government will shut down on Nov. 22. Republican lawmakers have insisted that is not likely, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Democrats about speculating about the possibility.\n\nDuring a morning television appearance, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) said Trump has shown an ability to go to great lengths to be disruptive, including directing his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to intervene in Ukraine policy.\n\n\u201cIf the president of the United States is willing to go to the lengths of setting up this parallel diplomatic channel through Rudy Giuliani \u2026 then sure, he\u2019s willing to shut down the government if that impedes this investigation,\u201d Moulton said on CNN. \u201cI think this president is incredibly dangerous because of the ways that he is willing to put Americans and our national security in danger for his personal political benefit.\u201d\n\nHis comments echoed those made by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m increasingly worried that President Trump will want to shut down the government again because of impeachment,\u201d Schumer told reporters. \u201cHe always likes to create diversions. I hope and pray he won\u2019t want to cause another government shutdown because it might be a diversion away from impeachment.\u201d\n\n8:20 a.m.: Trump suggests Pelosi pursuing impeachment to retain speakership\n\nTrump suggested that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is using the impeachment for her own political gain, calling it \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet, Trump quoted \u201cFox & Friends\u201d host Steve Doocy saying during Wednesday\u2019s broadcast that Pelosi was pursuing impeachment because she needed to satisfy demands from \u201cher political left\u201d to retain her speakership.\n\n\u201cA disgraceful use of Impeachment,\u201d Trump wrote in his own words. \u201cWill backfire!\u201d\n\nPelosi has repeatedly said that partisan politics is not driving the inquiry.\n\n8:15 a.m.: Jeffries confident \u2018overwhelming majority\u2019 of Democrats will support inquiry resolution\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), an ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in the House leadership, said Wednesday that he is confident that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of Democrats will support the resolution setting parameters for the impeachment inquiry when it hits the House floor on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens on the floor tomorrow, but I am clear that that resolution will pass,\u201d Jeffries said during an appearance on CNN.\n\nJeffries said it is \u201cnot clear to me at this particular point\u201d how many Democrats will break with the party and vote against the resolution, which sets rules for the upcoming public phase of the inquiry. He said he is unaware of any Republicans who plan to support it.\n\nDuring the interview, Jeffries said Democrats are also eager to focus on the substance of the allegations, as Trump is now urging.\n\n\u201cThe rough transcript confirms that Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to target an American citizen for political gain, and thereby solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cThat right there is textbook abuse of power, particularly because at the same moment $391 million in military and security assistance to the Ukraine that was allocated by Congress on a bipartisan basis was being withheld as part of a high-pressure tactic.\u201d\n\nTrump has insisted that there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d involving his request to investigate the Bidens and the military aid.\n\n7:35 a.m.: Trump urges fellow Republicans to defend him on substance\n\nTrump went on Twitter again Wednesday morning to weigh in on the impeachment inquiry, urging fellow Republicans to \u201cgo with Substance and close it out!\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, Republican lawmakers have largely focused on process as they have criticized the Democratic-led impeachment probe.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has suggested they defend him by arguing that he did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are very unified and energized in our fight on the Impeachment Hoax with the Do Nothing Democrats, and now are starting to go after the Substance even more than the very infair Process because just a casual reading of the Transcript leads EVERYBODY to see that the call with the Ukrainian President was a totally appropriate one,\u201d he tweeted Wednesday.\n\nTrump claimed the impeachment inquiry was \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201cjust a continuation of the Witch Hunt Hoax, which has been going on since before I even got elected.\u201d\n\nTrump later retweeted one of his attacks on the probe from Tuesday in which he derisively referred to Pelosi as \u201cNervous Nancy.\u201d\n\n7:30 a.m.: McCarthy slams Democratic resolution, Schiff\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) teed off Wednesday on the resolution unveiled by Democrats to guide the impeachment process going forward and on House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who is leading it.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re actually changing the process for the worse,\u201d McCarthy said during an appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re making Adam Schiff now the prosecutor, the judge and the jury, and they\u2019re denying more Republicans in the room.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, McCarthy repeatedly called Schiff a liar, and he took a shot at House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is playing a lesser role than Schiff for now.\n\n\u201cNadler is inept, so they know he can\u2019t manage it,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy also argued that the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s July call with Zelensky included nothing that would justify removing him from office.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing impeachable about this, so why are they dragging us through this once again?\u201d McCarthy asked.\n\n7 a.m.: House panel expected to advance resolution laying out parameters of public stage of inquiry\n\nThe Democratic-led House Rules Committee has scheduled a 3 p.m. meeting Wednesday at which members are expected to debate and advance a resolution setting the parameters of the public phase of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nA vote of the full House is expected on Thursday.\n\nThe resolution, which is backed by Pelosi, hands the lead role to the House Intelligence Committee and its chairman, Schiff, who would have broad latitude to organize extended questioning of potential public witnesses.\n\nIt also sets out for the first time the ability of House Republicans to make their own requests for testimony and documents, though those requests will be subject to a vote of the Democratic-majority committee \u2014 a practice that matches the minority powers in the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.\n\nHouse Republican leaders have blasted the Democratic tactics, arguing that the impeachment process was fatally flawed from the beginning and cannot be redeemed with the adoption of new procedures.\n\n6 a.m. Extended impeachment sparks concerns about disruptions to Democratic presidential primary\n\nHouse Democrats increasingly expect their impeachment effort against Trump to stretch well past Thanksgiving, possibly forcing a Senate trial into January or later \u2014 a timeline that could disrupt the final weeks of campaigning before the party starts to choose its nominee.\n\nHouse leaders had initially hoped to hold a floor vote before the Nov. 28 holiday so the Senate could hold a trial before Christmas. But the surprising number of witnesses agreeing to testify behind closed doors in the Capitol over the past few weeks has extended the timeline and sparked a debate over whether prolonged impeachment proceedings are politically prudent.\n\nSome Democratic strategists have raised concerns that an extended process that bridges the holiday season risks losing the nation\u2019s attention or lending credence to Republican claims that Democrats have been distracted from the bread-and-butter issues such as health care and job creation that they focused on in the 2018 election.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Michael Scherer and Mike DeBonis\n\n5:30 a.m.: Two more witnesses on deck this week\n\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s testimony, two additional witnesses are scheduled to appear before the end of the week: Timothy Morrison, special assistant to the president and senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council, on Thursday, and Robert Blair, senior adviser to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, on Friday.\n\n5:15 a.m.: Testimony from career diplomats to outline Trump\u2019s dark view of Ukraine\n\nTwo career diplomats will testify before House impeachment investigators Wednesday that Trump displayed a deeply pessimistic view of Ukraine that was out of step with officials at the White House and State Department who saw support for the European country as critical in its battle with Russian-backed separatists, according to their prepared remarks obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nThe State Department officials, Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, will say their optimistic view of Zelensky clashed with a darker outlook of the new government held by Trump and an informal channel of actors linked to the president\u2019s attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nAnderson, a career Foreign Service officer, will detail efforts when U.S. officials tried to demonstrate support for Ukraine only to be batted down by the White House, including after Russian forces attacked and seized Ukrainian military vessels in the Sea of Azov in 2018.\n\nCroft, who worked on Ukraine issues at the White House and the State Department, will say that \u201cthroughout\u201d her time in the Trump administration she heard the president \u201cdescribe Ukraine as a corrupt country,\u201d both \u201cdirectly and indirectly.\u201d\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 John Hudson and Elise Viebeck\n\n5 a.m.: Trump shares tweets of GOP allies critical of impeachment inquiry\n\nTrump shared tweets from Republican allies late into the night on Tuesday, with several of them focused on a resolution unveiled by Democrats setting the parameters of the public phase of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cDemocrats go 4+ weeks with a secretive, free for all, no rules impeachment process \u2014 and now try to save face with a short on substance resolution that only pretends to give the minority rights and blows up precedent,\u201d wrote Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) in one tweet shared by Trump on his Twitter account. \u201cAmericans will see right through this.
