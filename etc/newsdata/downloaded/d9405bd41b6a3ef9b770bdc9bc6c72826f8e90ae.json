However, the $1bn in wire transfers were revealed in records from just one institution.\n\n\"Records from one financial institution alone have shown approximately $1 billion in wire transfers between the Sacklers, entities they control and different financial institutions, including those that have funnelled funds into Swiss bank accounts,\" Ms James said, confirming claims first reported in the New York Times.\n\nShe did not name the financial institutions involved.\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for Mortimer DA Sackler, a former board member for the company, said in a statement to US media that there was \"nothing newsworthy about these decade-old transfers, which were perfectly legal and appropriate in every respect\".\n\n\"This is a cynical attempt by a hostile AG's office to generate defamatory headlines to try to torpedo a mutually beneficial settlement that is supported by so many other states and would result in billions of dollars going to communities and individuals across the country that need help,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nWhat is the latest with the case?\n\nIt was reported on Thursday that Purdue Pharma reached a tentative multi-billion dollar agreement to settle the lawsuits against it.\n\nAccording to the draft agreement, the Sacklers are expected to give up control of Purdue Pharma and personally contribute $3bn to the settlement.\n\nThe company would then file for bankruptcy, dissolve and reform, and would be removed from next month's legal proceedings.\n\nHowever a number of states, including New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, where the company is headquartered, said they were not party to the deal and would continue their fight against the company.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Protesters from Prescription Addiction Intervention Now (Pain) protested outside Purdue Pharma's headquarters on Thursday\n\nWilliam Tong, Connecticut attorney general, said: \"The scope and scale of the pain, death and destruction that Purdue and the Sacklers have caused far exceeds anything that has been offered thus far.\"\n\nJosh Shapiro, Pennsylvania's top lawyer, said the settlement was \"a slap in the face to everyone who has had to bury a loved one due to this family's destruction and greed\".\n\n\"It allows the Sackler family to walk away billionaires and admit no wrongdoing,\" he added.\n\nWhat is the opioid crisis?\n\nOpioids are a group of drugs that range from codeine to illegal drugs like heroin. Prescription opioids are primarily used for pain relief but can be highly addictive.\n\nOn average, 130 Americans die from an opioid overdose every day, according to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which says more than 200,000 Americans have died from opioid-related overdoses in the last two decades.\n\nPurdue is one of the opioid makers, distributors and pharmacies named in more than 2,000 lawsuits represented in a federal trial scheduled to begin in Ohio next month.\n\nThe cases allege the companies are responsible for fuelling an opioid addiction crisis in the US.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption More than 200,000 people in the US have died as a result of opioid addiction\n\nFirms including Purdue are accused of using deceptive practices to sell opioids including downplaying their addictive quality.\n\nPurdue argued the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, had approved labels for OxyContin that had warnings about the risks.\n\nIn a separate case, pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson was ordered by a US judge to pay $572m for its part in fuelling Oklahoma's opioid addiction crisis last month. Purdue had already settled with the state for $270m earlier this year.\n\nWho are the Sackler family?\n\nBrothers Arthur, Mortimer, and Raymond Sackler were all doctors from Brooklyn, New York, who in the early 1950s bought a medicine company called Purdue Frederick which would become Purdue Pharma.\n\nNow, the family are prolific philanthropists and their name adorns the wings of cultural buildings around the world - including the Louvre in Paris.\n\nAs the opioid scandal has engulfed the family, a number of high-profile museums - including the Tate in the UK and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York - have announced they will no longer take money from the family.\n\nThe Sacklers have argued they were passive board members of Purdue Pharma, who approved routine management requests and were not involved with the marketing of OxyContin.", "description": "The family owns OxyContin-producer Purdue Pharma, which is accused of fuelling the US opioid crisis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/167D9/production/_108812129_4d423544-6c13-43ee-a9b8-3f7ab371bc48.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
