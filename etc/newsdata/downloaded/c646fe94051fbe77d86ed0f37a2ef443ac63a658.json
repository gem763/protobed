In the last reported quarter, the company beat estimates by 17.87% on the back of higher contribution from both its segments \u2013 Reinsurance and Insurance.\n\n\n\nThe company delivered positive surprise in the last four quarters with the average being 20.66%.\n\n\n\nFactors at Play\n\nEverest Re\u2019s third-quarter results are likely to have benefited from insurance pricing gains in its different business lines, strong underwriting discipline ad share buyback.\n\n\n\nOverall premiums written in the quarter are likely to have gained from increase in renewal and new insurance pricing. Pricing is likely to have been driven by a combination of recent catastrophe losses, capacity shortages, trapped capital, pockets of poor loss experience and new found discipline from some of the largest players in both insurance and reinsurance.\n\n\n\nThe company is likely to have witnessed higher rates in the Property lines as well as Commercial auto business, Liability lines, Primary and Excess, Professional and Financial lines. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premiums earned in Bermuda, Insurance and International businesses indicates increase of 33%, 14% and 9.6%, respectively.\n\n\n\nStrong underwriting performance of Reinsurance and Insurance segments is likely to have aided combined ratio.\n\n\n\nInvestment income is expected to have gained from investment grade fixed income portfolio, which had a higher asset base compared to last year.\n\n\n\nAn increase in premium and investment income may have driven operating cash flows.\n\n\n\nThe company provided preliminary third-quarter pre-tax catastrophe loss estimate of $280 million or $225 million after tax primarily due to Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai. The estimated losses are net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums. Pre-tax estimated cat loss from Hurricane Dorian is $160 million while that from Typhoon Faxai is $120 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss ratio is 73%. In the year-ago quarter, the company\u2019s loss ratio was 72%.\n\n\n\nEverest Re boasts a capital position with low debt and high liquidity in its investment portfolio in addition strong cash flow. The company\u2019s share buyback activity is likely to have aided the bottom line.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $2.07, implying a decline of 49.3% from the year-ago quarter reported figure.\n\n\n\nWhat Our Quantitative Model States\n\n\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Everest Re this time around.
