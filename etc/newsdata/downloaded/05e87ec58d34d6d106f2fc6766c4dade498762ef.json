The index is back to the middle of the trading range that lasted for most of August and there is little support down to the 200-day simple moving average around 2850.\n\nBreadth is seriously ugly with around 1,300 gainers to 5,600 decliners. There are only around 200 new 12-month lows, which is quite limited given the extent of the selling and is worrisome because it definitely can become much worse.\n\nThe biggest positive at this point is that many individual stocks have already been pummeled and are finding support. It is helpful that the indices are finally catching up to the downside. It is hard for smaller, speculative stocks to bounce when the major indices are being slammed but if there is some stabilization that is a good sign.\n\nWhile it is painful if you are holding a lot of long positions in this sort of action, if you have cash on hand then you should be excited about some opportunities in the near term.\n\nThe S&P 500 is finally finding a little support as I write. It is important to watch for intraday lows that start to provide support.\n\nDowntrends are comprised of a series of failed bounces. Each time the recent lows are breached it produces another wave of selling. Eventually, it is exhausted and the first sign will be an intraday low that holds into the close.\n\nI'm doing nothing much at this point other than watching for some small-cap names to find support.", "description": "Indices are seeing the most severe downside momentum since early August.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Red Market Searches For Support Levels", "Indices Are Seeing The Most Severe Downside Momentum Since Early August.", "Alex Frew Mcmillan", "Bret Jensen", "Bruce Kamich", "Bob Lang", "Paul Price", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/9800fe9c-91da-11e8-98d4-d561f99c5599.jpg"}
