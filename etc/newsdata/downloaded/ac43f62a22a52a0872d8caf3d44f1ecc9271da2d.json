Without those tax benefits, Starbucks's earnings growth will fall below its previous projections of at least 10%, he said while speaking at the Goldman Sachs global retail conference.\n\n\"It's a very significant headwind to our [earnings per share] growth in fiscal 2020 as we [lose] those benefits,\" Mr. Grismer said. The company's next fiscal year begins Oct. 1.\n\nShares of Starbucks ended 0.7% lower Wednesday after recovering from a steeper decline earlier in the session. They are still up 49% for the year.\n\nStarbucks' warning comes as earnings forecasts for next year fall across the S&P 500. Analysts have been cutting profit expectations for S&P 500 companies. Some of the revisions followed downbeat outlooks for the second half of the year, while others were because of analysts' factoring in a tougher economic climate and trade tariffs.\n\nS&P 500 earnings are projected to grow nearly 11% in 2020, down from estimates of 12% at the end of June. Analysts slashed profit estimates for consumer-discretionary companies, which includes Starbucks; financial firms, and materials companies by some of the biggest margins over that time, pulling down earnings across the broad index.\n\nEven those numbers may still be too optimistic, Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup, warned in a recent note. Wage pressures and unpredictable shocks from trade and other geopolitical hostilities add to overall anxieties, he said.\n\n\"We think 2019 and 2020 numbers still need to get trimmed back, irrespective of trade-related worries, curbing near-term market upside,\" said Mr. Levkovich.\n\nWrite to Michael Wursthorn at Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 05, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
