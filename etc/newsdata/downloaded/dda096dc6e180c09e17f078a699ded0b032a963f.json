We want to be your friend and ally, your Athena, in doing so.\u201d\n\nJohnson smiled as Varadkar made the comment, although it is unclear whether it was because the British prime minister was pleased to see Varadkar aping the Johnson style of frequently quoting the classics, or whether he had really taken in the implications of what the Irish prime minister had just said.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the goddess Athena did assist Hercules as an ally during the performance of his 12 labours. She provided, for example, bronze krotala \u2013 noise-makers similar to castanets \u2013 to help him scare off the flock of Stymphalian birds. And in some versions of the tale she was also of service to him by returning to their rightful place the golden apples of the gods that Hercules had been asked to obtain.\n\nBut it is perhaps her most dramatic intervention in the life of Hercules that Varadkar was obliquely referring to.\n\nHercules was obliged to perform the 12 labours as an act of penitence after he had descended into madness and murdered his wife, Megara, and his children. At the moment he was about to go on and kill the man who had fostered him, Amphitryon, Athena intervened. Seeing that he had gone mad, she struck Hercules down and knocked him out to prevent him causing more bloodshed and doing more damage than he had already done.\n\nVery much what you would hope for from a friend and ally, but maybe not what you would want to hear on the international stage at a moment of tense diplomacy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boris Johnson reacts during the joint press conference.

However, his other words in the press conference were very clear indeed: \u201cThe story of Brexit will not end if the United Kingdom leaves on 31 October or even 31 January \u2013 there is no such thing as a clean break. No such thing as just getting it done.\u201d", "description": "The Irish PM cited a Greek goddess famous for knocking Hercules out to prevent him causing further damage", "authors": ["Martin Belam"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862ab42fca42bc21a048fe770f2549c45f6538e4/251_0_4008_2404/master/4008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1b557657375e3864faee9b68a19840f7", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
