It\u2019s an honor for us to have him leading our team.\u201d\n\nClemente, who once oversaw long-form programming at Fox News, was the first high profile executive to leave the channel after the company\u2019s longtime president, Roger Ailes, departed the company. Media reports at the time attributed Clemente\u2019s ouster not to sexual misconduct, but rather an internal power struggle between him and then network co-president Bill Shine.\n\nAlso Read: Billy Baldwin Drags Sean Hannity Over Past Comments Like 'All Gays Are AIDS Carriers'\n\nBefore Fox, Clemente spent nearly three decades at ABC News and also did a brief stint at CNN.\n\n\u201cNewsmax has demonstrated the ability to adapt and thrive in the highly transformative digital news world, and was one of the first major online outlets to create a TV brand in cable,\u201d said Clemente in the same press statement. \u201cI\u2019m excited to take on this new role at Newsmax during an incredible period of change, in a country eager for truth, understanding, and engagement in the news process.\u201d\n\nClemente will be joining his old Fox News colleague Bill O\u2019Reilly \u2014 who doesn\u2019t officially work or Newsmax \u2014 who frequently appears on the channel to offer commentary.\n\nRuddy is known to have been close to President Trump and frequently appears on television to discuss the president\u2019s mood on various matters. He raised eyebrows at the Financial Times Future of News conference last month when he casually told an audience that \u201cthe president is not a fact-based president. He\u2019s a salesman.\u201d", "description": "Michael Clemente was the first senior Fox News executive to leave the company after the departure of longtime president Roger Ailes", "authors": ["Jon Levine", "Brian Flood", "Scott Collins", "Ross A.
