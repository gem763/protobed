We will obviously do all the things we are required to by law,\u201d Pompeo said in a news conference in Greece. He did not elaborate on the contents of the letter.\n\nPompeo objected last week to efforts by Democrats to obtain depositions from current and former department officials as part of the investigation into whether Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart for a probe of Biden and his son in a July 25 call.\n\nLawmakers are looking at whether Trump jeopardized national security and the integrity of U.S. elections for personal political gain. Trump has called the impeachment investigation a \u201choax\u201d and accused the media and Democrats of corruption.\n\n\u2018CHANGES NOTHING\u2019\n\nAn official from the House Foreign Affairs Committee said in a statement to Reuters on Saturday that Pompeo had \u201cfailed to meet the deadline to produce documents required by the subpoena,\u201d but confirmed the State Department had contacted the three investigating committees.\n\n\u201cWe hope the Department will cooperate in full promptly,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nPompeo, who has acknowledged he listened to the July 25 call between Trump and Zelenskiy, said the Trump administration was \u201cincredibly focused in making sure that we worked with Ukraine in a way that was appropriate.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats on Friday subpoenaed the White House for documents they want to see as part of their impeachment investigation.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said on Friday that the subpoena \u201cchanges nothing\u201d and that it would be ultimately shown that Trump did nothing wrong.\n\nPompeo, on the last leg of a trip to southern Europe, said there were \u201cclearly politics\u201d involved in the investigation.\n\nHe also addressed a notion Trump has long held that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a theory that runs counter to the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s findings that it was Russia that meddled in the campaign.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attends a news conference with Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias following their meeting at the Foreign Ministry in Athens, Greece, October 5, 2019. REUTERS/Costas Baltas/Pool\n\nPompeo said \u201cgovernments have an obligation and indeed a duty to make sure that elections happen with integrity, without interference from any government, whether that\u2019s the Ukrainian government or any other.\u201d\n\nPompeo, a former U.S. congressman, said there had been congressional inquiries in the past that had harassed and abused State Department employees by contacting them directly and seeking to have them provide documents and records.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s harassment and I will never let that happen to my people,\u201d he said.", "description": "The U.S. State Department has issued an initial response to a Democratic-controlled congressional committee's request for documents related to the impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Saturday.", "authors": ["David Brunnstrom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437421985&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF940AY", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
