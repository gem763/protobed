Winston is going into his fifth season with Tampa Bay. In the five seasons he\u2019s been on the team he\u2019s never been to the playoffs and had lost his starting job briefly to Ryan Fitzpatrick.\n\nHe will get his potential last shot under new head coach Bruce Arians, who returned to football after a brief retirement. Winston has his prime target in Mike Evans back and will also have O.J. Howard catching. Chris Godwin and Cameron Brate also return to the offense.\n\nThere\u2019s going to be some added pressure on Winston to perform since he is entering the last season of his contract. Tampa Bay isn\u2019t the best team offensively, but they could definitely find more than five or six wins on their schedule heading into the 2019 season.\n\nThe defense had a -68 point differential last season and was among the worst in points and yards allowed. To rectify that, Tampa Bay signed Ndamukong Suh and drafted linebacker Devin White. Those are two major upgrades on defense who could thrive under Arians.\n\nRead below for more about the Buccaneers heading into the 2019 season.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n--\n\n2019 SCHEDULE\n\nWeek Date Time (ET) Channel Opponent 1 Sept. 8 4:25 pm FOX San Francisco 49ers 2 Sept. 12 8:20 pm NFL @ Carolina Panthers 3 Sept. 22 4:05 pm FOX New York Giants 4 Sept. 29 4:05 pm FOX @ Los Angeles Rams 5 Oct. 6 1:00 pm FOX @ New Orleans Saints 6 Oct. 13 9:30 am NFL Carolina Panthers (UK) 7 Bye 8 Oct. 27 1:00 pm FOX @ Tennessee Titans 9 Nov. 3 4:05 pm FOX @ Seattle Seahawks 10 Nov. 10 1:00 pm FOX Arizona Cardinals 11 Nov. 17 1:00 pm FOX New Orleans Saints 12 Nov. 24 1:00 pm FOX @ Atlanta Falcons 13 Dec. 1 1:00 pm FOX @ Jacksonville Jaguars 14 Dec. 8 1:00 pm CBS Indianapolis Colts 15 Dec. 15 1:00 pm FOX @ Detroit Lions 16 Dec. 22 1:00 pm TBD Houston Texans 17 Dec. 29 1:00 pm FOX Atlanta Falcons\n\n--\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nQB: Jameis Winston\n\nWR: Mike Evans\n\nTE: O.J.
