Russian assistance helped elect him. Money from wealthy Russians reportedly helped keep his businesses alive from 2006 to 2016. Since 2016, more and more foreign money has flowed Trump\u2019s way. Trump literally has a hotel open on Pennsylvania Avenue to accept payments\u2014there\u2019s a big carpet in front, his name on the door, nothing even remotely clandestine about the flow of corruption. That corruption seeks returns. Again and again, Trump has acted in ways that align with the interests of foreign states, raising questions about his motives.\n\nExactly what was promised in this particular conversation, and to whom, America and the world wait to hear.
