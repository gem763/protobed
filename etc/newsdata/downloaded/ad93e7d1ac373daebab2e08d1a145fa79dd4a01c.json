Nearly 800,000 left last year according to the International Organisation for Migration.\n\nOnly a very few of them went to Europe in 2018 when about 12,000 Afghans were recorded to have illegally crossed the EU borders. But that number could now double.\n\nMost of them have landed on Greek islands, where authorities are struggling to provide shelter. Charity group Oxfam said over 13,000 men, women and children were now crammed into the Moria camp on Lesbos, which was designed to accommodate 3,100 people.\n\nEU officials stressed that the situation remained manageable and was nowhere near as critical as in 2015, when more than 1 million migrants reached the bloc - 25% from Afghanistan - causing the worst migration crisis Europe had seen since World War II.\n\nStill, one EU official said the situation on the Greek islands was becoming \u201cdisturbing\u201d once again, while German Interior Home Minister Horst Seehofer warned last week that the EU risked a repeat of the 2015 chaos if member states did not adopt a common policy on migration.\n\nIn total, around 80,000 migrants have reached the EU in the first nine months of this year, but numbers are growing and the declining trend seen since the peak year in 2015 could be broken.\n\nSyrians seeking asylum in the EU have dropped to about 10,000 so far this year from more than half a million in 2015, but they are once again fleeing their homes.\n\nMore than 130,000 people have been displaced in northeast Syrian since the beginning of a Turkish offensive last week, United Nations said.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan has threatened to send more than 3 million Syrian refugees sheltered in Turkey to Europe if the EU opposed Turkey\u2019s actions in northern Syria.", "description": "More Afghans than Syrians have migrated to the European Union so far this year, official data shows, making them the largest nationality illegally entering the bloc, with many relocating from Iran partly due to the hardship caused by U.S. sanctions.", "authors": ["Francesco Guarascio", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
