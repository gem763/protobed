General Assembly, has refused to say whether he will resign if he is found to have broken the law, or will seek to shut down Parliament again.\n\nThe decision followed three days of hearings last week before a panel of 11 judges.\n\nThe court rejected the government\u2019s assertions that the decision to suspend Parliament until Oct. 14 was routine and not related to Brexit. It claimed that under Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution, it is a matter for politicians, not courts, to decide.\n\nThe government\u2019s opponents argue that Johnson illegally shut down Parliament just weeks before the country is due to leave the 28-nation bloc for the \u201cimproper purpose\u201d of dodging lawmakers\u2019 scrutiny of his Brexit plans.\n\nThey also accused Johnson of misleading the queen, whose formal approval was needed to suspend the legislature.\n\nJohnson and Parliament have been at odds since he took power in July with the determination to take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a divorce deal with Europe.\n\n___\n\nJill Lawless reported from New York.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In a major blow to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Britain's highest court ruled Tuesday that his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks in the crucial countdown to the country's Brexit deadline was illegal.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gregory Katz", "Mike Corder", "Jill Lawless"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/un_general_assembly_67973_c0-0-4716-2749_s1770x1032.jpg?dfcdf1b7d33206b4b41cba231fc280405f6b9305", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
