Entering the day, Saturday\u2019s game was basically a coin flip. The Astros declined to use Cole, who was lined up for a potential Game 7 on regular rest. Both teams emptied their bullpens for Game 6, and the game dragged as both managers tried to carefully navigate through matchups and jams.\n\nBut ultimately, Game 6 was a microcosm of how the Yankees were betrayed by many facets of their play this series.\n\nTheir pitching sputtered in key moments. Though the Yankees had the stronger bullpen \u2014 often a major factor in October \u2014 the Astros alleviated the load on their weaker relief corps by riding the three aces of their starting rotation. The Yankees\u2019 two wins this series came in the only games in which their starters completed five innings.\n\nAs a result, even more pressure heaped on the Yankees\u2019 bullpen, and Adam Ottavino, Chad Green and Tommy Kahnle \u2014 all reliable, workhorse relievers during the regular season \u2014 faltered. Green, who started Saturday\u2019s game, surrendered a double to Altuve, walked Alex Bregman and then gave up a three-run blast to Yuli Gurriel in the first inning. Kahnle, having pitched in eight of the Yankees\u2019 nine games this postseason, looked like he was running out of steam as he labored through a critical sixth inning on Saturday.\n\nThe Yankees\u2019 defense was shaky at times, from catcher Gary Sanchez\u2019s repeated troubles stopping balls to a costly mistake in the sixth inning. Trailing by one run and with runners on the corners, Yankees Manager Aaron Boone didn\u2019t move the infield in. And when Bregman hit a ground ball, Gregorius hesitated just enough when he looked at Altuve at third base that Bregman beat out the double play at first base. It allowed Altuve to score and pushed the Astros\u2019 lead to 4-2.", "description": "Minutes after D.J. LeMahieu tied the game in the top of the ninth, Jose Altuve hit a game-winning home run in the bottom half to send the Astros to the World Series and end the Yankees\u2019 season.", "authors": ["James Wagner", "David Waldstein"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/19/sports/19alcs-topper/19alcs-topper-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
