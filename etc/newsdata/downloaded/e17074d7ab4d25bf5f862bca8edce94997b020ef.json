The senators also ask how the companies would verify claims of victims who are depicted in the videos and images.\n\n\"The threat of deepfakes is real, and only by dealing with it transparently can we hope to retain the public's trust in the platforms it uses, and limit the widespread damage, disruption, and confusion that even one successful deepfake can have,\" they write.\n\nThe issue of deepfakes \u2014 specifically a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that went viral in May \u2014 was raised at a dinner Warner organized with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in Washington last month. At least some of the other companies have previously engaged with the lawmakers on the topic, according to an aide familiar with the discussions, but this is the first time senators have demanded a concrete response.\n\nDoctored Pelosi video highlights the threat of deepfake tech\n\nSome of the social media giants have recently begun confronting the issue of deepfakes and publicly discussing at least part of their efforts to detect them.\n\nIn September, Facebook announced it would contribute $10 million to establish a \"Deepfake Detection Challenge\" along with nine partners. A Facebook spokesman also pointed to other initiatives the company is undertaking to combat deepfakes, including a $7.5 million effort to research manipulated media and various internal efforts to improve detection.\n\n\"Deepfake video development and the potential for use by bad actors requires a whole-of-society approach,\" Facebook's Andy Stone said. \"We are committed to working with others in industry and academia to come up with solutions.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Twitter said fighting deepfakes fall under the company's efforts to combat misinformation and manipulation generally, and pointed to a letter in July from a Twitter executive to Congressman Adam Schiff detailing the company's policy. A LinkedIn representative said the company removes \"confirmed fake content\" and \"invest[s] in systems and technology that give us the ability to monitor, detect, and remove inappropriate content.\"\n\nLast week, Google and its \"technology incubator\" arm Jigsaw released a large dataset of deepfakes that the company created using paid actors and publicly available deepfake generation methods. And last month, Reddit and Twitter banned deepfake pornographic videos from their platforms \u2014 though other AI-based content remains.\n\nWednesday's letter is far from the first time lawmakers have raised alarms about the threat \u2014 both Warner and Rubio have spoken publicly for over a year about the implications manipulated video might pose for national security in general and election security in particular. Deepfakes were the exclusive subject of an open hearing held in June by the House Intelligence Committee. And the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment, an annual report produced by the U.S. intelligence community, specifically cited deepfakes as a likely component of foreign influence operations, including those expected to be used in the 2020 U.S. elections.\n\n\"Adversaries and strategic competitors probably will attempt to use deep fakes or similar machine-learning technologies to create convincing \u2014 but false \u2014 image, audio, and video files to augment influence campaigns directed against the United States and our allies and partners,\" the assessment warned. \"[T]he threat landscape could look very different in 2020 and future elections.\"", "description": "Senators Mark Warner and Marco Rubio are calling on 11 tech companies to develop a plan to deal with the proliferation of \"deepfakes\" on their platforms", "authors": ["Olivia Gazis", "Stefan Becket"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/07/02/ca21a241-77f2-4782-a3ee-0469af85524f/thumbnail/1200x630/25d26726fb161424b20583988fe330de/ap-18182526835003.jpg"}
