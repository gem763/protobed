Here\u2019s how it stacks up against the competition.]\n\nFast forward to Friday, when West dropped his latest album, \u201cJesus Is King,\u201d an effort described by one critic as a \u201cclear-cut foray into Christian hip-hop.\u201d Among the 11 songs on the album is one titled \u201cClosed on Sunday,\u201d a kind of love letter and sermon on faith, church and Chick-fil-A. Some sample lyrics:\n\nClosed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A\n\nHold the selfies, put the \u2019Gram away\n\nGet your family, y\u2019all hold hands and pray.\n\nAs if to prove that it won\u2019t be bullied by a famous rapper, or the competition, Popeyes announced Monday that it will reintroduce the chicken sandwich that, for a brief moment this summer, united America \u2014 mostly in a line of cars at the fast-food chain\u2019s drive-through. Given its widespread appeal, the return of the sandwich was predictable. What was not was the sandwich\u2019s comeback date: Nov. 3. That, in case you haven\u2019t heard, is Sunday.\n\n\n\nChicken on Sundays: Popeyes takes aim at one of its major competitors. (Popeyes)\n\nThat\u2019s the day that Chick-fil-A is closed, a tradition that can be traced back to the late founder S. Truett Cathy\u2019s Southern Baptist faith.\n\nIf this sounds like a slap across the cheek of Chick-fil-A \u2014 a chain repeatedly called out for its support of anti-LGBTQ organizations, even after the company downplayed its conservative agenda \u2014 it is. It absolutely is. Popeyes\u2019s short announcement video offers ample evidence.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been following the saga of Popeyes\u2019s chicken sandwich, let\u2019s briefly recap:\n\n\u2022 In August, Popeyes unveiled its crispy chicken sandwich, available with pickles on a brioche bun, with either mayonnaise or a spicy Cajun sauce.\n\n\u2022 Everyone in the food media swoons over the sandwich (and takes their jabs at Chick-fil-A\u2019s politics).\n\n\u2022 The chicken sandwich interloper ruffles the feathers of Chick-fil-A, the third-largest restaurant chain in the United States.\n\nBun + Chicken + Pickles = all the \u2764\ufe0f for the original. pic.twitter.com/qBAIIxZx5v \u2014 Chick-fil-A, Inc. (@ChickfilA) August 19, 2019\n\n\u2022 Popeyes responds with a classic two-word Southern phrase, setting off the summer\u2019s fried chicken sandwich war.\n\n\u2022 Popeyes sells so many sandwiches, so fast, that the chain burns through its entire inventory by late August. It hopes to bring the item back \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u2022 At least one customer, who wouldn\u2019t accept the bad news, pulls a gun at a Popeyes in Houston, apparently hoping the weapon would make a sandwich magically appear.\n\n\u2022 The chain suggests customers could bring buns to Popeyes and build their own sandwich. The eye-rolling emoji gets a workout on social media.\n\n\u2022 Two months after the crispy chicken sandwich goes AWOL, Popeyes announces its return via a statement that is two words long. It reads: \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d\n\nThe implication here is clear: The Popeyes chicken sandwich is as big as Michael Jordan in his Airness\u2019s heyday. Certainly bigger than Kanye West.\n\nRead more on Voraciously:\n\nIt\u2019s almost Halloween, and \u2018feetloaf\u2019 is already giving us nightmares\n\nWant an Anthony Bourdain keepsake?
