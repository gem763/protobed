The United Nations said 100,000 people had fled their homes.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Turkey's Defence Ministry said that 415 YPG militants had been \"neutralised\" since the operation began, a term that commonly means killed.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), with the Kurdish YPG as its main fighting element, now holds most of the territory that once made up Islamic State's \"caliphate\" in Syria, and has been keeping thousands of fighters from the jihadist group in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nThe Kurdish militia say the Turkish assault could allow the jihadist group to re-emerge as some of its followers were escaping from prisons.\n\nIn its first big attack since the assault began on Tuesday, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a deadly car bomb in Qamishli, the largest city in the Kurdish-held area, even as the city came under Turkish shelling.\n\nFive Islamic State fighters fled a jail there, and foreign women from the group being held in a camp torched tents and attacked guards with sticks and stones, the SDF said.", "description": "US officials are reportedly split over whether the shelling was a mistake or a deliberate attempt to pressure the Americans into leaving the war zone", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Daren Butler", "Image", "Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564555.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Explosion-is-seen-over-the-Syrian-town-of-Ras-al-Ain-as-seen-from-the-Turkish-border-town-of-Ceylanp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
