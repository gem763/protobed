As Powell got up from the canvas, it was clear Surin had actually been choked out shortly after that thumbs-up.\n\nPowell could be heard yelling, \"He's out!\"\n\nSurin tried to get up from the floor as he was regaining conciousness and, amidst all the confusion, targeted the referee with a single leg takedown.\n\nThe fight was then waved off, and Powell had clearly won. You can't mistakenly attack the ref and be deemed in a fit enough state to continue.\n\nWatch it all unfold here:\n\nIt was Powell's 10th victory of his professional career (three knockouts, four submissions, and three decisions) against four losses.\n\nLater in the night, Kevin Ferguson Jr. beat Craig Campbell with punches, Paul Daley knocked out Saad Awad, and Douglas Lima won a $1 million paycheck for his decision victory over Rory MacDonald in the Bellator welterweight World Grand Prix final.\n\nRead more:\n\nPhotos of Josh Taylor's horrific eye injury show how gruelling and unforgiving boxing can be, even when you win\n\nDereck Chisora plows through David Price to score a 4th round knockout just days after saying he was going to 'murder this guy'\n\nFormer WWE superstar Jake Hager laughs in the faces of people who think former pro wrestlers can't fight MMA\n\nIreland's next top boxer has a rare shot at retribution after losing at the Olympics because of a 'fixed' fight: 'It's personal for my career, my legacy'\n\nConor McGregor's coach still thinks he's the best fighter in the world despite his heavy beating by Khabib Nurmagomedov", "description": "Marcus Surin was submitted by Devin Powell at Bellator 232 on Saturday and went for the referee with a single leg takedown amid all the confusion.", "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db6bac7dee0191f280704a5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
