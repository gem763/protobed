By far and away Palace\u2019s best player, an over-reliance on Zaha this season is beginning to show and may be to blame for his poor form.\n\nLast season Hodgson used Zaha mostly on the left of a 4-5-1 or as part of a roaming strike partnership with Andros Townsend in a 4-4-2. From these starting positions he was able to dribble down the left wing and attack on his right foot when close to goal, isolated one v one with the opposition full-back.\n\nBy far and away Palace\u2019s best player, Zaha's form has been poor this season and the team have only scored eight league goals - more than only Newcastle and Watford. The thing is, despite this Crystal Palace are enjoying an impressive start to the season - is he that important after all?\n\nRival managers target Zaha by doubling up on him, and defenders kick him a lot - Zaha is the second most fouled player in the Premier League this season and last - but this is old news and doesn't explain such a drop in performance.", "description": "Wilfried Zaha wanted to leave Crystal Palace in the summer but without anyone willing to pay the money required to pry him from Roy Hodgson\u2019s grip, he remained at Selhurst Park.", "authors": ["Jj Bull", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/24/ss-composite-image-2019-10-24-16-13-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
