Plus, there\u2019s no better remedy for such conditions than their seasoned running back duo of Rodney Smith and Shannon Brooks that combined for 322 rushing yards last week against Illinois.\n\n\u201cWe love the cold. No doubt. That\u2019s our mentality,\u201d defensive end Carter Coughlin said. \u201cYou come up to Minneapolis, and it\u2019s our weather, you better be ready to play in it, because we\u2019re going to be.\u201d\n\nThe skill position players were directed to dip their hands in ice buckets between every series in practice this week, the footballs used were frozen and wet, and the thermostat in the indoor facility was turned down to the upper 50s. Even the defense had ice and water dumped down the backs of their jerseys, just in case.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to look back and say, \u2018I wish I would\u2019ve done something to prepare for that,\u2019\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can.\u201d\n\nWhen Minnesota hosted Michigan State on Oct. 31, 2009, the kickoff temperature was 39 degrees (3.9 Celsius). The forecast is calling for slightly colder than that, with a chance of snow. The coldest pre-November game ever held at TCF Bank Stadium was against Purdue on Oct. 10, 2009, at 31 degrees (minus 0.5 Celsius).\n\nThe Huskers (4-2, 2-1) aren\u2019t about to be psyched out by the chill. They\u2019ve played in these conditions before. Hey, their head coach\u2019s name is Scott Frost, after all.\n\n\u201cI have no control over the weather, so it\u2019s one of those things where God blessed us with the day, so just be thankful for it,\u201d defensive lineman Darrion Daniels said. \u201cI\u2019m not used to playing in cold weather, but I get used to it. After warmups, I\u2019ll be straight.\u201d\n\nQB QUESTION\n\nHuskers quarterback Adrian Martinez left the game against Northwestern last week with a left knee injury, as did star wide receiver J.D. Spielman. Frost sidestepped questions this week about their availability. If Martinez isn\u2019t cleared, Noah Vedral would start.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a lot better place at the quarterback spot than we were a year ago at this time,\u201d Frost said. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019ve got several guys who know the offense and are talented enough to make things happen.\u201d\n\nDOMINANT DEFENSE\n\nThe Gophers held the Illinois offense to three points last week, a stark improvement from the year before when the Illini totaled 646 yards in a lopsided victory.\n\n\u201cEverything that you saw on Saturday, we\u2019d practiced at that intensity for the entire week,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that was kind of missing.\u201d\n\nWHERE\u2019S MO?\n\nMaurice Washington was Nebraska\u2019s leading rusher through four games, averaging 7.7 yards per carry, but over the last two games he has run a total of nine times for a net of 10 yards.\n\nWashington, who\u2019s facing charges in California in connection with a child pornography case, was suspended for the first half of the opener against South Alabama and again for the first half against Northwestern last week. After the Huskers kicked the winning field goal as time ran out, Washington ran directly to the locker room.\n\n\u201cWe hold our players to a certain standard and we want them all to live up to that standard,\u201d Frost said. \u201cWe held him out the first half. We\u2019ll see how he responds this week. We want him to come back and prepare well and get ready to play well and, if he does, this will all be water under the bridge.\u201d\n\nMAKE IT SNAPPY\n\nThe accuracy of freshman center Cam Jurgens\u2019 snaps in the shotgun formation has been one of Nebraska\u2019s biggest concerns. The Associated Press counted seven snaps against Northwestern that required the quarterback to jump to catch it, including one that sailed past Vedral.\n\n\u201cThere is no excuse for it now,\u201d said right tackle Matt Farniok, a team co-captain. \u201cIn week seven we need perfect snaps, and it is just the number one rule of our center, and that is what we expect from our center. He knows he needs to fix it, and he has been working on it.\u201d\n\nSECOND-HALF SLUMPS\n\nBoth teams have been outscored by their opponents this season in third quarters, though Minnesota scored on its first such possession in the last two games. Nebraska has struggled mightily coming out of the half. In four straight games, the Huskers have given up a touchdown or a field goal on the first defensive series of the second half, and the offense has punted on its first possession. Frost has made this an issue with his players.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether to line them up and scrimmage for a couple plays before we start the second half,\u201d Frost said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The weather in Minnesota this weekend is forecast to turn wintry.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Campbell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/illinois_minnesota_football_10429_c0-84-2018-1261_s1200x700.jpg?59bf22b78576e1143a40540ba632938a4b1aac99", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
