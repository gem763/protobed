The sweaters\u2014lovingly knit by his mother\u2014were a cozy and constant presence for his young fans.\n\nBehind the scenes, the production staff of PBS\u2019s Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood had to get creative to keep the classic Fred Rogers\u2019s look alive\u2014a comfy style that Tom Hanks will channel in the upcoming movie, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.\n\nWhen the show debuted in 1968, Mister Rogers wore button-down sweaters. But by the second season, some zip-up sweaters were added to the rotation\u2014much easier to fasten, says David Newell, who played delivery man Mr. McFeely on the show. During one early episode, Fred buttoned his sweater wrong, but he opted to use the footage anyway. \u201cHe wanted to show children that people make mistakes,\u201d Newell recalls in an interview. But zippers were easier to get into, and they didn\u2019t bump against the microphone, so he made the switch.\n\nThe centerpiece of the classic Fred Rogers look was his mother\u2019s handiwork \u2014 Nancy McFeely Rogers knit the sweaters in a variety of colors, making a new one every Christmas. When his mother died in 1981, the supply of new handknit sweaters dried up. By the early 1990s, after hundreds of tapings, the yarn was wearing thin.\n\nWhat viewers of Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood never saw was the frantic search his production staff underwent to replace the iconic cardigans before they wore out entirely.\n\nThe show was a frugal operation, and the art department didn\u2019t have the resources to replicate the sweaters by hand. \u201cIt was a small budget,\u201d says Kathy Borland, the art director for the last decade of the show. \u201cIt was a Pittsburgh show, not New York and L.A. He wanted to keep it small and local. It was homey, not show business.\n\nWell-meaning knitters from the Pittsburgh area brought in their best attempts, but they never worked out. \u201cThey would come in with the sweater, and I knew it would be wrong,\u201d Borland said. The right sweater had to be easy to zip up and down so he wouldn\u2019t get distracted as he sang \u2018It\u2019s a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.\u2019 And it had to be a rich color that would pop on camera. \u201cThis was a television sweater, not a walking-down-the-street sweater.\u201d\n\nThe art department scoured stores and catalogs, but in the early 1990s, men\u2019s zippered cardigans weren\u2019t exactly in fashion. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find them. Nobody wore those zippered sweaters,\u201d said Margy Whitmer, the producer of the show. \u201cThey weren\u2019t cool then.\u201d\n\nAfter striking out at stores, Borland spotted a postal worker on the street wearing a cardigan looked a lot like Fred\u2019s. She asked if she could see the label and jotted down the name of the manufacturer.\n\nThis is where the story gets hazy. Borland said she remembers calling the maker of the postal sweaters but doesn\u2019t remember whether she got them from that company or another supplier they recommended.\n\nA+ School and Everyday Apparel, a sweater manufacturer based in Burlingame, California., has supplied the U.S. Postal Service for decades, and Vince Knoss, co-owner of the company, says it is \u201cvery possible\u201d that the show\u2019s production staff bought their zip-up cardigans from one of the company\u2019s many distributors around the country. \u201cWe always thought Fred Rogers wore our sweaters,\u201d he says but sales records don\u2019t go back far enough to confirm it.\n\nThe cardigans themselves give no indication of their source, since Borland had to buy all-white sweaters and remove the labels before dyeing them. She had plenty of experience as a wardrobe designer dealing with massive tasks \u2014 for George Romero\u2019s Day of the Dead, she worked on some 500 zombie outfits. To dye Fred\u2019s sweaters, she purchased an industrial sized soup pot from a restaurant supplier and hung them on a clothesline in her backyard. \u201cIt was a big decision to buy the pot. It cost $70,\u201d she says. Stirring constantly with a yardstick, she saturated the sweaters in shades of purple, green, red, blue and rust.\n\nThen another problem presented itself\u2014the fabric around the zipper did not absorb the dye. Catherine McConnell, the show\u2019s assistant art director, would fill in the stark white strip with permanent marker. The art department also waxed the zippers for smoother donning and doffing. \u201cEvery time he put that sweater on,\u201d Borland says, \u201cmy heart would go into my feet.\u201d Once they got a smooth zip on camera in the opening scene, she could relax.\n\nThey also performed surgery on the collars. The new sweaters had a folded collar like a dress shirt, while Fred\u2019s original sweaters had the narrow collar of a varsity jacket. \u201cWe had to take off half the collar. We had to make it look good inside and out because he took it off and put it on a hanger,\u201d Borland says.\n\nSometimes, the sweaters required maintenance to keep them up to television standards. Borland remembers the time when Fred wore a green sweater to visit Koko the Gorilla 1998. When he came back, he would smell the gorilla on the sweater. He plucked the chest area of the sweater and asked Borland to smell it, she recalled.\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d she said. It stunk. She washed it, and because it faded a little, she had to re-dye it.\n\n\u201cHe was oblivious to clothes,\u201d Newell says. \u201cSometimes we would say, \u2018Fred, you have to buy a new sports jacket.\u2019 But he would say, \u2018It\u2019s too expensive.\u2019\u201d And keeping his weight at a trim 143 pounds\u2014after the number of letters in each word of the phrase \u201cI love you\u201d\u2014he didn\u2019t have to buy a bigger size.\n\nThe sweater was always more than a costume or a prop. \u201cThey were a symbol of play clothes,\u201d Newell says. \u201cHe was meeting children on their level.\u201d\n\nIn 1984, Rogers donated one of the sweaters knit by his mother to the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History. \"Mister Rogers\u2019 style of comfort and warmth, of one-on-one conversation, is conveyed in that sweater,\" said Dwight Bowers, one-time cultural historian at museum, in 2003. \"Can values be taught via mass culture? I think Mister Rogers is proof that they can.\"\n\nFor fans of the show, the sweater was a symbol of his connection to children and a reminder of our childhoods, but for Fred, it was also a symbol of his mother\u2019s love. As Bill Isler, former president and CEO of Fred Rogers Company, says, \u201cFred was very proud that his mother had knit a sweater that\u2019s in the Smithsonian.\u201d", "description": "The USPS, a $70 soup pot and whole lot of effort went into finding the perfect zip-up cardigan for Fred Rogers", "authors": ["Cristina Rouvalis"], "top_image": "https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/wsVvvak4pXzZF_1UveFJFIYhR-k=/fit-in/1600x0/filters:focal(2711x654:2712x655)/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/95/e0/95e09366-12dc-422e-9af9-5ce698555e51/gettyimages-3408125.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
