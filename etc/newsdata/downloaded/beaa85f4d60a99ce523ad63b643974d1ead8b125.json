Will this be a successful retest and hopefully a buying opportunity or is there a risk of a lower low?\n\nIn this daily bar chart of UNH, below, we can see that prices have made lower highs in the past 12 months - December, February and July. Lower lows were made in late December and April so far. The $64,000 question from late March is whether a new low is made soon or if the pattern is changing?\n\nUNH is trading below the declining 50-day moving average line and the bearish 200-day line. Trading volume shows a big surge in turnover in April into that low but a similar surge is not appearing this month. Low or lower volume at a price low can mean that the market is \"sold out\" and we do not have the same degree of anxiousness to \"get out now\".\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been stable since May and has not declined much from the July high. Prices appear to have fallen of their own weight.\n\nThe 12-day price momentum study in the lower panel shows higher lows from late August into late September despite prices making lower lows. This is a bullish divergence and suggests that the decline is slowing.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of UNH, below, we see a mixed to bearish picture. Prices are below the declining 40-week moving average line. On the positive side we see that the $210 area or level has acted as support a number of times the past two years.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been weakening from October and the MACD oscillator is in a sell mode below the zero line.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of UNH, below, we can see that the software is projecting a possible downside price target of $190. A rally to $238.53 would be bullish.\n\nBottom line strategy: The three charts above each tell a different story so the tricky part is which one(s) do we want to give a greater weighting in our decision. With prices extended on the downside I would be more positive now but a close at $210 makes the picture more vulnerable.", "description": "Let's get the charts and indicators in for a check up....UNH", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "The Mixed Picture On Unitedhealth Group Warrants Closer Monitoring", "Let'S Get The Charts", "Indicators In For A Check Up.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jonathan Heller", "Jim Cramer", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Alex Frew Mcmillan", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/unitedhealthgroupsign-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
