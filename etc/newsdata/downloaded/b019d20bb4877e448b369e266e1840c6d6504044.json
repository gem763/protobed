As well as her allegations over equal pay, she accused the BBC of constructive dismissal, harassment and discrimination.\n\nIn the claim, seen by the Guardian, the former head of product in the corporation\u2019s design and engineering division claimed the BBC was such a discriminatory, hostile workplace environment that her position became untenable, leaving her little choice but to resign.\n\nThe BBC denied Barlow\u2019s allegations, but in May it agreed to an out-of-court settlement on condition that Barlow formally withdrew her claim. Her settlement included a \u201ctermination fee\u201d as compensation for her loss of employment.\n\nIn its response to Barlow\u2019s allegations, the broadcaster admitted she was paid less than 15 male heads of product in her department. The BBC says the discrepancy was because Barlow did not engage in work of equal value to the male comparators, citing \u201cnon-gender\u201d reasons for the differences in pay.\n\nA BBC spokesperson said: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe it is appropriate at this stage to comment on what is an individual matter that was resolved some time ago.\u201d\n\nBarlow, who was not barred from discussing her situation by the terms of the agreement, said she had been unfairly treated. \u201cInequality at the BBC is a choice,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThe BBC destroyed my career, my confidence, my mental wellbeing, and nothing will ever make up for that. So they can give as much money as they like, but it will never bring that back.\u201d\n\nThe disclosure of the settlement comes at a time when the BBC is facing severe scrutiny over its handling of gender pay issues. The corporation is under investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission over historical claims of unequal pay. Last October, a committee of MPs found the BBC was in denial over the issue, and demanded an end to a culture of \u201cinvidious, opaque decision-making\u201d on pay.\n\nBarlow, who joined the BBC in 2012, said she first came to believe she was being underpaid when the corporation published its career path framework data in 2017. In the same year, the BBC found male staff earned an average of 9.3% more than women.\n\nUntil then, she said, she had believed that the broadcaster would act in good faith. \u201cI think at that point, I was still very much believing that they were trying to solve this problem,\u201d she said. \u201cBut goodwill starts to go quite quickly when you see nothing\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nShe embarked on the BBC\u2019s informal pay enquiry process, which differs from a formal grievance in that it does not allow input from the person, or for a grievance meeting to take place. In the process, she received a 25% salary increase. However, with little explanation or transparency over the decision, Barlow suspected she was still being underpaid. She then raised a formal pay grievance and used data protection laws to force the release of her pay review.\n\nBarlow found she was paid at least \u00a39,000 a year less than her male peers, and in her claim stated she believed she was underpaid by up to \u00a369,000 a year in comparison to some of her peers, who were nominally in the same pay bracket. The BBC has yet to provide Barlow with a breakdown of her peers\u2019 pay, despite her requests.\n\nBarlow told the Guardian she believed there was a disconnect between what the BBC publicly saying about its commitment to equal pay and its approach behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cThe BBC refusing to explain my pay, whilst publicly claiming a transparent process was in operation, was infuriating,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cI was sidelined, undermined, and retaliated against. The BBC has spent an enormous amount of time and public money to try and justify why I was considered less value than all of my male peers.\u201d\n\nIn February, Barlow resigned from the BBC citing constructive dismissal. She said the broadcaster left her feeling \u201cdisempowered and discredited\u201d.\n\nWhile there has been much public focus on the pay of the BBC\u2019s on-air, high-profile female presenters, such as the former China editor Carrie Grace, staff behind the scenes have also come forward. By the end of February 2018 more than 1,000 behind-the-scenes staff had registered pay complaints.\n\nLawrence Davies, a discrimination lawyer for Equal Justice, who represented Barlow, said that while the BBC was addressing concerns over equality publicly, he had seen little or no progress since he wrote the report on sexism and ageism at the BBC with Selina Scott a decade ago.\n\n\u201cIndividually it may seem like a few thousand pounds when looking at snapshot, but collectively the debt owed to women continues to grow every year. Women are being forced to leave their jobs after complaining about equal pay, due to retaliation, and prohibitive legal costs.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf the civil offence of failing to pay equal pay were ever criminalised it would easily be the largest and most successful theft in our history.\u201d\n\nBarlow said the BBC was full of intelligent, dedicated staff but that in some areas an \u201cold boys\u2019 club\u201d wielded excessive power.\n\n\u201cThe frustration is immense, because I see a lot of people who work very hard, and they\u2019re just treated badly, or driven into the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so it doesn\u2019t matter how many brilliant women you bring in, if this is what happens to them when they get there.\u201d", "description": "Caroline Barlow filed claim after finding 15 men were paid more for equivalent roles", "authors": ["Rossalyn Warren"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35223f51856f505c0f1dd6c16ff6a2233f505251/0_79_2750_1650/master/2750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=270239966635cc2f6924622c3da9083f", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
