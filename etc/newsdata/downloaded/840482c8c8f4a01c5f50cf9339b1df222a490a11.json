(NYSE:FCX) Have A Place In Your Dividend Stock Portfolio?", "language": "en", "text": "Dividend paying stocks like Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason - some research suggests a significant amount of all stock market returns come from reinvested dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.\n\nA slim 2.3% yield is hard to get excited about, but the long payment history is respectable. At the right price, or with strong growth opportunities, Freeport-McMoRan could have potential. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Freeport-McMoRan for its dividend - read on to learn more.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Freeport-McMoRan!\n\nNYSE:FCX Historical Dividend Yield, October 7th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 29% of Freeport-McMoRan's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.\n\nWe also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Freeport-McMoRan paid out 2079% of its free cash flow last year, suggesting the dividend is poorly covered by cash flow. Paying out such a high percentage of cash flow suggests that the dividend was funded from either cash at bank or by borrowing, neither of which is desirable over the long term. Freeport-McMoRan paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Freeport-McMoRan to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.\n\nIs Freeport-McMoRan's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Freeport-McMoRan has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. Freeport-McMoRan has net debt of 1.94 times its EBITDA, which we think is not too troublesome.\n\nNet interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Interest cover of 3.76 times its interest expense is starting to become a concern for Freeport-McMoRan, and be aware that lenders may place additional restrictions on the company as well.\n\nWe update our data on Freeport-McMoRan every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Freeport-McMoRan Inc.
