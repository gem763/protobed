The parties have been meeting ahead of an Oct. 31 deadline set by Waterfront to reach agreement on topics such as data privacy, land values and geographical boundaries, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private.\n\nSidewalk had proposed investing $1.3 billion alongside local partners to kick off the development, anchoring Google Canadian headquarters in neighbouring Villiers Island.\n\n\u201cThese discussions continue and no decisions have been made,\u201d Andrew Tumilty, spokesman for Waterfront Toronto, said in an email. \u201cBoth parties are working to ensure that a decision can be reached by the October 31 2019 deadline.\u201d A spokeswoman for Sidewalk Labs declined to comment.\n\nNew York-based Sidewalk\u2019s plan for the 12-acre plot along Lake Ontario was launched with great fanfare in 2017. Meant to showcase Alphabet CEO Page\u2019s vision for a modern digital city, ideas included everything from underground garbage disposal to heated bike lanes. But it quickly got overtaken by worries over the data collected to power the neighbourhood, financing and just how much control a foreign tech titan should have over public lands.\n\nSidewalk responded by consulting with more than 20,000 people, proposing to put data collected in the neighbourhood \u2014 key to powering amenities \u2014 into an independent civic trust and build thousands of below-market and affordable housing units. Sidewalk CEO Dan Doctoroff, is the former CEO of Bloomberg LP.\n\nIf the parties resolve the key issues, Waterfront\u2019s board will decide on Oct. 31 whether to move ahead with an evaluation. If that goes ahead, the board will decide on March 31 whether to pursue implementation agreements with a deadline for finalizing a deal by Dec. 31, 2020. If no agreement is struck, the partnership will terminate and Sidewalk Labs will be left empty handed after investing more than $50 million to develop its 1,500-plus-page plan.\n\nSidewalk released its master innovation and development plan in June, which raised many of the controversial issues now being discussed.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "If no deal is struck, Sidewalk will be left empty handed after investing more than $50 million to develop the plan", "authors": ["Natalie Wong", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/sidewalk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
