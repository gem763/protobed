REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\n\nStride was responsible for tax policy as financial secretary to the Treasury from June 2017 until May this year, before serving for two months as leader of the House of Commons, in charge of the Conservative government\u2019s business in parliament.\n\nSpeaking in parliament after his election by fellow politicians, Stride promised to chair parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee \u201cwith the utmost fairness\u201d.\n\nThe cross-party committee regularly questions Bank of England officials, the finance minister and tax officials in charge of Brexit preparations, and has also led inquiries into malpractice in Britain\u2019s financial sector.\n\nHowever, his appointment was greeted with disappointment by campaigners hoping to secure softer treatment for thousands of contractors who avoided income tax for more than a decade through loan schemes which tax authorities have objected to.\n\n\u201cWe will have to take appropriate steps to ensure that there is no conflict of interest when he comes to scrutinizing decisions he was party to at HM Treasury, particularly the Loan Charge,\u201d Wes Streeting, a Treasury Committee member from the opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter.\n\nAfter his election, Stride said the committee\u2019s priority should be scrutinizing new finance minister Sajid Javid\u2019s first budget, due on Nov. 6, the government\u2019s Brexit policy and the appointment of a successor to BoE Governor Mark Carney.\n\nJavid has already refused a request from the committee to provide updated economic analysis on the cost of Brexit, saying that a deal Johnson had reached with Brussels last week was \u201cself-evidently\u201d in Britain\u2019s interest.\n\nStride opposed Brexit before June 2016\u2019s referendum and described himself as \u201crealistic about the challenging consequences of a no deal\u201d in a column for the PoliticsHome website earlier on Wednesday.\n\nHe also said he wanted the committee to look more at whether online businesses were taxed enough, the generosity of tax relief designed to promote business investment, and high marginal effective tax rates faced by poor families on benefits.\n\nStride will serve until the end of the current parliament - which could be soon, if Johnson can persuade the opposition to support an early election which he has said he wants to break the Brexit impasse.\n\nThe previous permanent chair of the Treasury Committee, Nicky Morgan, stepped down when Johnson appointed her as his culture minister in July.\n\nStride received 263 votes in the final stage of voting for the chair, while there were 175 votes for his nearest rival, the Conservative lawmaker Kevin Hollinrake.", "description": "Mel Stride, a former junior finance minister who lost his job in government when Boris Johnson became prime minister, has won an election to chair the British parliament committee which supervises the Bank of England and finance ministry.", "authors": ["David Milliken", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444170968&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1JK", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
