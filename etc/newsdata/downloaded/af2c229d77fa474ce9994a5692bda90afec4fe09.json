He said Colt would still supply revolvers and pistols and is expanding its network of dealers.\n\n\"Colt has been a stout supporter of the Second Amendment for over 180 years, remains so, and will continue to provide its customers with the finest quality firearms in the world,\" he said.\n\nThe move comes as gun manufacturers and dealers have come under intense pressure following a series of lethal shooting sprees involving AR-15-style weapons. Democratic White House contender Beto O'Rourke, who's from El Paso, Texas, where one of those massacres occurred, said recently that would confiscate military-style weapons from gun owners if he captures the presidency.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Yes,\" said O'Rourke, who doubled down on his position during a recent appearance on CNN's \"Cuomo Prime Time, \"When it comes to AR-15s and AK-47s, weapons designed for use on a military battlefield, the high-impact, high-velocity round that is fired from those weapons. When it comes to those weapons ... the answer is yes.\"\n\nWalmart recently announced it would stop selling handguns in Alaska and short-barrel rifle and handgun ammunition nationwide. Dick's Sporting Goods pulled hunting rifles from 125 of its stores earlier this year.\n\nFox News media reporter Joseph A.
