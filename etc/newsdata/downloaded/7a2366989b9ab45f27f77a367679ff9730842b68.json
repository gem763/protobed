In 1925, the school moved to Dessau, before a final school was established in Berlin in 1932. In 1933, the Bauhaus school was shut down by the Nazis. The impact of the school was huge, cities and buildings around the world were inspired by its modernist ideas.\n\nThis year's Frieze is playing host to over 160 galleries from 35 countries.\n\nOne international gallery attending is New York-based Gagosian. Their display is called \"HELIOS\", which takes its name from the ancient Greek sun deity. There are paintings, collages and sculpture.\n\nNew for 2019 is a curated section, dedicated entirely to woven works. Curator Cosmin Costinas has gathered eight international artists that experiment with the technique.\n\nIt is showing woven items have more to offer than just function.\n\nThe section includes Hong Kong based artist Angela Su, who uses hair embroidery in her work. The hair was taken from a wig maker.\n\nCreated during months of turbulent protests in Hong Kong, Su's works reframe sewing \u2014 traditionally seen as a gentle activity \u2014 into an extreme form of protest.\n\nOne shows an eye sewn shut by real human hair, a reference to a lack of freedom of expression.\n\nUltimately, art fairs are about selling works and this year's Frieze is no exception.\n\nFor those with money to spare, British artist Ryan Gander is presenting a new iteration of his project \"Time Well Spent.\"\n\nIt is a black vending machine. For \u00a3500, visitors can make a purchase and be randomly rewarded with either a rock or a diamond.\n\nGander says it explores the value we place on objects and the value of time, rocks and diamonds both take hundreds of years to form.\n\nFrieze London opens to the public 3-6 October in London's Regents Park.", "description": "Influenced by Bauhaus, contemporary artists at Frieze London are dreaming of a utopian future.\nThe annual art bonanza is marking the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Bauhaus school in Weimar, Germany.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/60/68/1000x563_cmsv2_bca08721-1c67-5059-9f2a-7c7f0dbade45-4206068.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
