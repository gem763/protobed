REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo\n\nNigeria\u2019s September crude oil and condensate output was 2.1-2.2 million barrels per day (bpd), the director of its state oil company said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe will (cut) across the assets. The OPEC quota (is) on crude production only, not on condensate, so it doesn\u2019t affect the condensate,\u201d he told reporters at a conference in Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\u201cOur non-conformity is clearly on the crude, and it\u2019s not significant so when you spread it across all the assets it will not be a shock.\u201d\n\nKyari added that Nigeria hoped to raise oil production to about 3 million bpd in the next 2 to 3 years.\n\nThe 14-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed in December with non-OPEC partners including Russia to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd from the start of this year.\n\nOPEC\u2019s share of the cut is 800,000 bpd, to be delivered by 11 members, with exemptions for Iran, Libya and Venezuela.\n\nAccording to a Reuters survey published on Monday, Nigeria had pumped beyond its quota by 265,000 bpd in September, more than any other OPEC state.\n\nIraq, Congo, Ecuador and Gabon had also over-produced but by much smaller margins, the survey found.\n\nNigeria is also discussing potential investment opportunities with Saudi Aramco and ADNOC of the United Arab Emirates in Nigeria, and discussing potential gasoline supply with Aramco trading.\n\nThe NNPC was exploring the possibility of ADNOC investing in mid-stream pipelines and refineries in Nigeria, Kyari said.\n\n\u201cWe are talking to (Aramco Trading) ... We are looking at all opportunities and they are quite keen to supply gasoline to West Africa\u201d, he added.", "description": "Nigeria will make cuts to its crude oil output to comply with OPEC output targets, Mele Kolo Kyari of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435909499&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902YI-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
