Thanks to the Shelby County Sheriff\u2019s Office and one of their K-9 officers, Bandit, the missing three-year-old boy was located in just under 10 minutes.\n\nAccording to a Facebook post made by the Shelby County Sheriff\u2019s Office, deputy Frank Bleigh and K-9 Bandit were dispatched to the scene in front of a home. Within just 10 minutes, Bandit picked up the scent of the missing boy and was able to quickly locate him. According to Fox News, the young boy was found a quarter of a mile away from his home.\n\n\"This is exactly why we have dog units,\" the Facebook post read. \"Watching this track you could tell very well that Bandit had the scent of the child and was well on his way to finding him. I would like to thank Frank and Bandit for a job well done and it was so amazing to watch this unfold.\"\n\nInstantly, the comment section of the post lit up with social media users praising Bandit for a job well done.\n\n\"Heartwarming outcome! Awesome job K9 Bandit and handler,\" one woman wrote. \"So glad the child was found safe and so quickly.\"\n\n\"Way to go K-9 Bandit! You the man! Thank you so much for your dedicated service,\" another shared. \"Officers are so wonderful, but no one can take the place of these special noses, our beloved, K-9\u2019s! God bless them all!\"\n\nOthers asked the sheriff's office to provide Bandit with plenty of dog treats.\n\nFor years, herding dogs like Bandit, who is a German Shepherd, have been trained to use their strength and intelligence to herd livestock \u2014 something that translates well when it comes to police work. Along with several other breeds, K-9s like Bandit help police apprehend suspects, using their noses to detect drugs, explosives, and other crime scene evidence, as well as help find missing people. According to the American Kennel Club, search and rescue dogs are able to cover miles of forests, find those buried in an avalanche, and even find drowned victims underwater.\n\nShelby County Sheriff\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A K-9 in Ohio was able to detect the scent of a missing three-year-old and lead his handler to the boy within only 10 minutes.", "authors": ["Yahoo Lifestyle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/u9Z6lKzBvKqoWuRC8xVc5A--~B/aD0xMDk4O3c9MTkzMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/61560f10-eba2-11e9-bede-1fa890307305", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
