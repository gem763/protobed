Once secured, crews can begin to dismantle the tower of the crane, and remove it piece by piece.\n\nThe crane came down on Sept. 7, as Hurricane Dorian made landfall in Nova Scotia as a post-tropical storm with hurricane-strength winds.\n\nPhotos taken during the site's assessment show the crane bent and twisted. (Government of Nova Scotia)\n\nOn Sept. 9, Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency issued an evacuation order, affecting residents and businesses in the area. At the time, it was estimated the evacuation order would last days, if not weeks.\n\nThe crane removal was originally slated for two weeks ago, but was put on hold when the issue of potential liability was raised among those involved in the removal process.\n\nOnce the crane is secured and anchored to the building, crews can start dismantling the tower of the crane and removing it piece by piece. (Government of Nova Scotia)\n\nOn Sept. 18, the provincial government held a press conference to declare a localized state of emergency, moving the liability onto the province so the removal process could get underway faster.\n\n\"Essentially, we're the insurance company,\" Labour Minister Labi Kousoulis said at the time.\n\nIt's still unclear who will be footing the bill for the lengthy and costly process.\n\nIt's also likely estimated timelines will change, the release said, and further updates will be provided early next week.\n\nEstimated approach and timelines will likely change as the process continues, the province said in a news release.
