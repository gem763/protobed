If President Donald Trump nominated you to the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 or to any high-ranking judicial office, for that matter \u2014 would you seize the moment and say yes?\n\nAfter watching the takedown of Kavanaugh, both Part One and now, the emerging Part Two, no doubt those who would have grabbed at that chance are now thinking twice. After all, nobody has a 100 percent clean and clear past.\n\nNobody has a closet that\u2019s free of all skeletons.\n\nSo the question in today\u2019s vicious political climate, brought to you courtesy of the Democrats, is whether or not you, as an otherwise esteemed member of the court system and community in which you live, could properly address all the skeletons that would be dragged, for all to see, from your closet. The question is whether you could suffer the absolute hate that would be unleashed during the nomination process. And not just at you. At your family, as well.\n\nThis is the giggling Democrats\u2019 long-range plan; this is the message they\u2019re sending with their baseless smears of Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times has finally admitted that the premise of its much-hyped story about an alleged incident with \u2026 Kavanaugh was false, as the alleged victim [of the alleged sexual harassment] says she has no recollection of the incident in-question,\u201d The Federalist reported.\n\nBut not until the damage was done.\n\nNot until Kavanaugh was raked, once again, over the coals for sexual harassment allegations he\u2019s already addressed \u2014 already denied \u2014 and for which the country, minus the left, have already dismissed and decided unfounded.\n\nDemocrats running for the White House took to the national airways, post-New York Times report, to call for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment.\n\nTo low-information voters everywhere, the past 24 hours of media circus generated by the skewed New York Times\u2018 report has shown one thing, and one thing only: Kavanaugh is guilty. And he\u2019s guilty enough to be impeached.\n\nWhatever happens from here is shoulder-shrugging to Democrats because their mission has been accomplished, their messaging has gone out. Future judicial picks from the GOP have been set on notice.\n\nIf Trump wins a second term, which at this point seems very likely, and if Trump gets an opportunity to nominate another Supreme Court justice, which again, at this point seems very likely, the picks he\u2019d like to name may not, quite possibly would not, say yes.\n\nThe picks he\u2019d like to name may say thanks, but no thanks, out of fear of being Kavanaughed.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
