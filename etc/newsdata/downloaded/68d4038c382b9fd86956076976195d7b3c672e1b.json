She mentioned a couple of things about my children.\u201d (See the video above.)\n\nDespite that, he appeared compassionate about Westerhout\u2019s situation.\n\n\u201cShe called me. She was very upset, she was very down,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad. I wished her well.\u201d Trump, who called Westerhout, 28, a \u201cvery good person\u201d who did a great job, didn\u2019t say if she had been fired or had resigned, only that her departure Thursday was \u201cautomatic.\u201d\n\nPolitico reported Friday that Westerhout resigned because she had mocked Trump\u2019s relationship with his children at an Aug. 17 dinner near the president\u2019s golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nAfter a \u201ccouple of drinks,\u201d she boasted that she was closer with Trump than were his daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany, two sources told Politico. She also quipped that the president was so unfamiliar with Tiffany that he couldn\u2019t pick her out in a crowd. The New York Times reported that she also talked about Trump\u2019s eating habits, his thoughts on Tiffany\u2019s appearance, and his youngest son, Barron.\n\nTrump told reporters: \u201cTiffany is great. I love Tiffany.\u201d The president said he would call his younger daughter when he reached Camp David.\n\nWesterhout, a former Republican Party aide, has been with Trump since he was elected.\n\nTrump scolded the \u201cdishonest media\u201d for ignoring the rules of an off-the-record dinner. \u201cThis was an off-the-record dinner and the media blatantly violated that agreement,\u201d an administration official told Politico. Westerhout\u2019s confidences, however, only appeared to have been discussed later at the White House, and not to the public.\n\nA friend of Donald Trump Jr. accused Phil Rucker of The Washington Post of \u201cburning\u201d Westerhout.\n\nBut Steven Ginsberg, national editor at The Washington Post, said in a statement to Politico that Rucker is \u201cone of the best and most scrupulous reporters in the news business. He has always acted with the utmost honor and integrity and has never violated Washington Post standards or policies.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated Westerhout\u2019s age as 27. Also, it had mischaracterized her boast about her close relationship to Trump.", "description": "But Politico reports that Madeleine Westerhout criticized his relationship with his children and said that Trump couldn't pick daughter Tiffany out in a ...", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d69d833240000860071c2cb.jpeg?cache=wv17rpnoc1&ops=1778_1000"}
