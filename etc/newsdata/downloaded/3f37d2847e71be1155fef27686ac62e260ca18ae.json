It focuses on the events of the night.\n\nIn it, inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick criticised London Fire Brigade\u2019s \u201cstay put\u201d policy, and said lives could have been saved if people had been evacuated earlier.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nResidents were told to remain in their flats for nearly two hours after the fire, which began in a fridge-freezer, broke out.\n\nSir Martin praised firefighters\u2019 bravery, and said the \u201cprincipal\u201d reason the blaze spread so quickly was because the block\u2019s flammable cladding \u201cacted as a source of fuel\u201d. But he said many \u201cinstitutional\u201d failures meant the brigade\u2019s preparation for such an incident was \u201cgravely inadequate\u201d.\n\nAnd he censured LFB commissioner Dany Cotton\u2019s \u201cremarkable insensitivity\u201d in saying she would not have changed anything about the night\u2019s response.\n\nThe report also found mistakes made in responding to the Lakanal House high-rise fire, in Camberwell, South London, in 2009, which killed six, \u201cwere repeated\u201d.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe second phase of the inquiry, due to start in January, will analyse the wider situation, including the block\u2019s design.\n\nThe FBU\u2019s Matt Wrack said the inquiry should have first examined \u201cthe real causes of what happened to Grenfell and why flammable cladding was wrapped around the building\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou should look at the causation and who took the decisions... because there are Government ministers who are evading scrutiny. Yet the actions of individual firefighters are being scrutinised.\u201d\n\nHe also tweeted: \u201cFirefighters did not put flammable cladding on Grenfell Tower. Firefighters risked their own lives time and again.\u201d\n\nJeremy Corbyn paid tribute to the firefighters, adding: \u201cThousands are still at risk because of the Government\u2019s failure to remove similar cladding from other tower blocks.\u201d", "description": "Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, said firefighters \"did not put flammable cladding on Grenfell Tower\"", "authors": ["Matthew Young", "Image", "Adam Gerrard Daily Mirror", "Getty", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20751157.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Matt-Wrack.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
