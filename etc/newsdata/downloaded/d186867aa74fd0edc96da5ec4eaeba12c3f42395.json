(Lintao Zhang/Getty Images)\n\nIt was a rough showing for Team USA in the FIBA World Cup this summer.\n\nThe United States, following an 87-74 win against Poland in Beijing on Saturday, finished in seventh place in the tournament \u2014 the team\u2019s worst ever finish in a World Cup or Olympics.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nCoach Gregg Popovich, however, isn\u2019t here for any criticism coming his team\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cSome people want to play the blame game. There\u2019s no blame to be placed anywhere,\u201d Popovich said Saturday, via ESPN. \u201cThey want to play the shame game, like we should be ashamed because we didn\u2019t win a gold medal? \u201cThat\u2019s a ridiculous attitude. It\u2019s immature, it\u2019s arrogant, and it shows that whoever thinks that doesn\u2019t respect all the other teams in the world and doesn\u2019t respect that these guys did the best they could.\u201d\n\nTeam USA struggled to fill its roster throughout the tournament, too. Many notable players skipped the tournament \u2014 which managing director Jerry Colangelo didn\u2019t appreciate \u2014 and only had nine healthy players for the final game on Sunday after losing Kemba Walker, Jayson Tatum and Marcus Smart to injuries.\n\nPopovich, though, defended the players who he did have in China for his inaugural outing at the helm of the national team.\n\n\u201cTheir effort was fantastic,\u201d Popovich said, via ESPN. \u201cThey allowed us to coach them. You give people credit for what they did, and that\u2019s it. But it\u2019s not a blame and shame game. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nA lot can, and probably should, happen in the coming months for USA Basketball as they prepare for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics next summer.\n\nPopovich, though, isn\u2019t there yet. His focus, along with the rest of the players and coaches who made the trek across the Pacific Ocean for the tournament, will shift back to the NBA ahead of the 2019-20 season.\n\nNaturally, that comes first.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t really the time to even think about that,\u201d Popovich said, via ESPN. \u201cIt\u2019s 10 months away.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Gregg Popovich stood by Team USA after its seventh-place finish at the FIBA World Cup, the team\u2019s worst-ever showing in a World Cup or Olympics.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4M6kb7XqivRMuAqB9OU_gQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Yi0NLhopvZqYgC8iQPuZ0A--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/a1c11920-d746-11e9-b96d-1871f334fc2c", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
