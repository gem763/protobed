The Redskins held Keenum out of practice as a precautionary.\n\nIn the session open to reporters, Keenum threw the ball in individual drills and did not have a noticeable limp when walking.\n\nBackups Dwayne Haskins and Colt McCoy also participated Thursday, making it the first time since Aug.13 all three quarterbacks practiced. McCoy had missed the last month-and-a-half with a leg injury.\n\nEarlier this week, Gruden backed Keenum as the starter moving forward, despite the veteran committing five turnovers against the Bears.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
