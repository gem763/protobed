Kosgei won in Chicago last year in 2:18:35.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling good and I am happy because I was not expected to run like this,\u201d Kosgei said.\n\nKosgei\u2019s run came little more than 24 hours after fellow Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge became the first man to run 26.2 miles in less than two hours, clocking 1:59:41 in Vienna. Unlike Kipchoge\u2019s performance, however, Kosgei\u2019s mark was set in an official race on a record-eligible course.\n\nRadcliffe first set a world record at Chicago in 2002 before besting her own mark a year later in London.\n\n\u201cIt was 17 years ago exactly today that I set the first world record here in Chicago,\u201d said Radcliffe, who attended Sundays\u2019 race. \u201cThat was a special day for me today and it\u2019s a very special day for Brigid today.\u201d\n\nKosgei, who also won this year\u2019s London Marathon in 2:18:20, set a fast early pace but slowed a bit after the halfway mark. She was waving to the crowd as she approached the finish line, nearly seven minutes ahead of runners following her.\n\nAbabel Yeshaneh and Gelete Burka, both of Ethiopia, finished second and third. Yeshaneh\u2019s time was 2:20:51 and Burka\u2019s was 2:20:55\n\nLawrence Cherono sprinted across the finish in the men\u2019s race to beat Dejene Debela by one second. The Kenyan Cherono finished in 2:05:45, with Ethiopia\u2019s Debela two strides behind. Asefa Mengstu, also of Kenya, came in third three seconds behind Cherono.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden when we reach 41 kilometer, the (other runners) were not going again,\u201d Cherono said. \u201cI decided to kick and felt I was still having enough energy to sprint. I tried my luck and it worked.\u201d\n\nCherono won the Boston Marathon in April in 2:07:57. Sunday\u2019s win marked his eighth career marathon victory.\n\nDefending champion Mo Farah, who set a European record here last year, finished in ninth in 2:09:58\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Brigid Kosgei of Kenya won the Chicago Marathon on Sunday in 2 hours, 14 minutes, 4 seconds to break the world record in the event.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/chicago_marathon_97428_c0-232-5568-3480_s1200x700.jpg?d042ba9cdffe740cc9608ebfe48d30fe03930ac4", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
