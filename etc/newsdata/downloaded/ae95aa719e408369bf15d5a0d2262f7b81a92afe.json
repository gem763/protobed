Kayla was one of the Americans captured and tortured by ISIS, and was raped by the terror group\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was finally killed during a U.S. raid on Saturday.\n\nPresident Trump spoke to Kayla Mueller\u2018s parents \u2014 Carl and Marsha Mueller \u2014 for nearly 20 minutes by phone on Sunday, answering many of the questions that they had for him regarding the U.S. military operation that resulted in the death of their daughter\u2019s captor and rapist, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to a report by AZcentral.\n\nThe report added that O\u2019Brien first delivered some new, heartwarming information to Carl and Marsha, which was that the military mission to take out al-Baghdadi had been named after Kayla.\n\n\u201cIt was so touching for us to know that,\u201d said Carl.\n\nKayla was taken hostage in 2013 while she was in Syria performing humanitarian work. She was then held captive for 18 months, and personally raped by al-Baghdadi, before her death in 2015, after an unsuccessful rescue mission.\n\nOn Saturday, al-Baghdadi was chased down by a female Belgian Malinois during a U.S. military raid, before evidently giving up and detonating his suicide vest, killing himself in an explosion.\n\n\u201c[Kayla] wants us to get them \u2014 I\u2019ve felt that with all my heart,\u201d said Marsha, who is sure that her daughter would be happy to hear of al-Baghdadi\u2019s ultimate demise.\n\nCarl said that he sat at the dining table and made a list of questions for President Trump, while anticipating his call.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t write it down, you forget in the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very intimidating.\u201d\n\nWhen the president called on Sunday afternoon, the conversation began with condolences, but soon segued into more details involving Kayla, which Carl and Marsha found comforting, as they found that President Trump actually knew their daughter\u2019s story, and what she \u2014 as well as her parents \u2014 had endured, according to AZcentral.\n\n\u201cHe was very cordial,\u201d said Carl, \u201cit was almost like talking to a friend.\u201d\n\nThe report added that Carl told President Trump that he had successfully answered a lot of his and Marsha\u2019s questions. Then, when Kayla\u2019s father paused, the president asked, \u201cDo you have any more?\u201d\n\nThere was reportedly one question that President Trump couldn\u2019t answer, which the president promised would be brought up in a meeting on Monday.\n\nThe report also noted that some relatives \u2014 as well as individuals who worked on the unsuccessful mission to rescue Kayla and other hostages in 2015 \u2014 had blamed the Obama administration for not acting quickly enough on giving the mission a green light.\n\n\u201cNow they get a victory,\u201d said Carl. \u201cNaming it after Kayla would make that victory even sweeter.\u201d\n\nOn Monday morning, the Muellers received another phone call. This time, it had been from Vice President Mike Pence, who also let them know that Kayla was not forgotten.\n\n\u201cThis administration is being proactive, and we are very confident we are going to be be able to get the answers we\u2019ve been wanting for six years,\u201d said Carl. \u201cWe have the ear of the White House now \u2014 it\u2019s what we needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still say Kayla should be here,\u201d said Marsha, \u201cand if Obama had been as decisive as President Trump, maybe she would have been.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "President Donald Trump, VP Mike Pence, and White House National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien have all contacted Kayla Mueller's parents.", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/ht_kayla_prooflife_grab_lf_160818_16x9_992-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
