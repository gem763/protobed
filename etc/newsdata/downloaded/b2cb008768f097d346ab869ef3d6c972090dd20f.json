(Walter Astrada)\n\nWalter Astrada has worked as a photojournalist for 20 years. Born in Argentina, Astrada began his career at his hometown paper, Buenos Aires\u2019s La Naci\u00f3n. After that, he spent several years covering news events for agencies while living in numerous countries. During that time, he also worked on long-term projects on social issues and human rights violations.\n\nFour years ago, Astrada decided to continue exploring the globe on his own. He said, \u201cDriven by my desire to experience more of the world, on May 1, 2015, I left Barcelona with the idea of traveling the world with my camera, a Royal Enfield motorcycle and documenting the countries I am observing as I go along.\u201d\n\nDuring Astrada\u2019s travels, he eventually made his way to Paraguay, where he said he \u201cwanted to go and photograph the Arete Guasu in the Paraguayan Chaco.\u201d Astrada describes the event in the following words:\n\n\u201cArete Guasu is the sacred celebration of the Western Guarani people and has been held since time immemorial, each year, in their ancestral territories of the great South American Chaco (central Chaco in Paraguay, southern Bolivia and northeastern Argentina). The ritual is a meeting of several worlds (of the living, the ancestors, the dead) from the Guarani cosmology, with a rituality, where masks, costumes, musicians and staging come together in a meeting between the sacred, the ancestors, and the so-called \u201cgames\u201d and the uninterrupted music of the bands.\u201d\n\nYou can find out more about Astrada, and follow his journeys, on his website.\n\n\n\nBoys covered with mud arrive to participate in the cuchi-cuchi game.
