A Ruby Guard and a Sapphire Princess,\u201d the boy explained the other day at a coffee shop near his home in Bethesda. \u201cThe Ruby Guard protects the Sapphire Princess. She gets in trouble, and the Ruby Guard saves her, and then \u2014 then they merge together to make Garnet.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe paused, pulling his knees closer to him.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s kind of cool.\u201d\n\nFor children with gender dysphoria \u2014 a mismatch between gender identity and the sex on their birth certificate \u2014 or who are interested in exploring different gender expressions, Halloween can have special significance, said Darren Vance, executive director of the nonprofit Rainbow Families and the father of a non-binary teen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that once-a-year opportunity where people get free license to push the boundaries of identity,\u201d Vance said. \u201cFor kids who are curious, just the spirit of Halloween, the costuming aspect, provides a perfect opportunity to do that.\u201d\n\nThe Bethesda boy, whose parents asked that his name be withheld to protect his privacy, passed a piece of paper to his mother one evening this August. On it, he\u2019d written four words that he says he had already known to be true for several months: \u201cI am a boy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIssues of gender have shaped the family\u2019s conversations this Halloween, said his mother, who agreed to be identified by her first name, Jenny. But the 10-year-old never explicitly raised it as a consideration.\n\n\u201cHe identifies as male, but that\u2019s a very tiny piece of himself,\u201d Jenny said of her son, whose love for Mario Kart is matched by a Die-hard devotion to RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. \u201cHe\u2019s 10. He loves dressing up as whatever he wants.\u201d\n\nTurning to her child, she reminded him of last Halloween. \u201cYou were like a zombie queen, zombie princess, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cEh,\u201d he replied, shrugging. \u201cI think I was just a dead zombie that wore a dress,\u201d\n\nWeeks before this Halloween, Jenny and her son tried to create a Garnet costume but struggled to get it exactly right. They bought a wig to mimic the character\u2019s rectangular hairdo and a pair of star-shaped glasses. But repeated attempts to transform a T-shirt to resemble Garnet\u2019s pink body suit fell apart.\n\nAdmitting defeat, they headed to Party City. If Garnet was not an option, the 10-year-old wanted an inflatable costume \u2014 the kind he had seen on viral YouTube videos and that \u201ccan do stuff where it\u2019s like, it can make it look like something that\u2019s not real.\u201d\n\nHe debuted his inflatable \u2014 and decidedly non-gendered \u2014 T-Rex costume this past Saturday, at a Rainbow Families Halloween party that drew two other blowup dinosaurs as well.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe moment he tottered into the gymnasium at Alexandria\u2019s Browne Academy, the boy was swarmed by kids reaching for the costume\u2019s tail and oversized head.\n\nSome of the young partygoers that night were gay or non-binary, but most had parents who were LGBTQ. In recent years, Vance said, the nonprofit has welcomed a growing number of cisgender, heterosexual parents who have LGBTQ children, and like Jenny, want to expose them to different family structures.\n\nThe boy ran and bounced through the gymnasium, trailed by a shrieking group of princesses, ghosts and zombies. Two mothers dressed as dwarves to complement their daughter\u2019s Snow White. A pair of dads were Toy Story\u2019s Buzz and Woody. Gender roles seemed far less important than having fun.\n\nAD\n\nStanding off to the side, Jenny chatted with other parents, one eye on her little T-Rex. The past few months have not been easy for him, she said. He started at a D.C. private school this fall after being bullied at the public school he used to attend. His struggles with depression and anxiety have worsened in recent weeks, prompting a leave of absence from school that his parents hope will be temporary.\n\nLike many other parents of trans kids, Jenny and her husband say they are trying to affirm their son\u2019s identity with the right clothes and pronouns, while processing the realities of LGBTQ discrimination. They read news accounts of violence against trans people with deepened anxiety, paying especially close attention to the recent assaults on trans women in the Washington area. They want their son to grow up clear-eyed and resilient, Jenny said. But above all, they want him to be happy.\n\nMidway through Saturday\u2019s party, as Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller\u201d came on through the sound system, the 10-year-old masquerading as a dinosaur grew restless. He zipped open the cumbersome Polyester suit and stepped out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe would don it again on Thursday, the actual night of Halloween, but for now, he had other plans.\n\nThe chorus to Jackson\u2019s Halloween classic soared. Jenny walked toward the front of the room, watching her son perform cartwheels and backbends with a friend, dressed just as himself. Holding onto his crumpled, deflated costume, she smiled.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d she said, \u201che wanted to be a little freer.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Experts say Halloween can have particular appeal for children with gender dysphoria.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VWn7kYxqX5LxX9F3bmGtqmwhGZI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OVUWXCH2N4I6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
