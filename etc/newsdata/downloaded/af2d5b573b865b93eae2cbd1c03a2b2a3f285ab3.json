They allege the company deceptively marketed opioids by overstating benefits and downplaying risks.\n\nPurdue has been accused of contributing to a public health crisis that has been marked by nearly 400,000 overdose deaths between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest U.S. data. Purdue and the Sacklers have denied they are liable for the opioid epidemic.", "description": "Purdue Pharma seeks to halt opioid suits against company, Sacklers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8H24P_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
