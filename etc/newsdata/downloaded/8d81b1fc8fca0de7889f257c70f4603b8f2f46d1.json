Trading volume topped 12.9 million shares, well above the full-day average of about 7.3 million shares, FactSet data show.\n\nThe coffee seller said it expects fiscal 2020 earnings-per-share growth to be below its long-term growth target of \u201cat least 10%.\u201d The current FactSet consensus for fiscal 2020 EPS of $3.12 implies 10.6% growth over the fiscal 2019 consensus of $2.82.\n\nAt a Starbucks investor gathering in December, Chief Financial Officer Patrick Grismer said that, as a result of the benefit of share repurchases and efforts to cut general and administrative expenses, he expected EPS growth of \u201cat least 13%\u201d on average for 2020 and 2021.\n\nOn Wednesday, at the Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference, Grismer said one \u201cvery significant headwind\u201d to 2020 EPS growth is the effective tax rate, given the one-time nature of the tax benefit realized in 2019.\n\nRegarding share repurchases, Grismer said the company chose to pull forward about $2 billion in share repurchases that were originally planned next year to the current fiscal year.\n\n\u201cSo in the context of a rapidly appreciating share price and given that we have the liquidity to do it, we pulled forward those share repurchases, and we\u2019re able to preserve what we had expected by way of an EPS growth contribution to or from the share repurchases, net of the associated interest expense,\u201d Grismer said at the Goldman conference, according to a FactSet transcript. \u201cBut again we do expect and EPS growth outlook for fiscal 2020 that is meaningfully below the ongoing algorithm that we had laid out at our investor day.\u201d\n\nThe reason the stock-price appreciation warranted increased share buybacks was that at the investor gathering in December, Grismer said the EPS growth model included an algorithm that supports an EPS benefit from share repurchases of about 2%. If the stock-price appreciation is more rapid than expected, the amount of shares the company can repurchase decreases, which also decreases the benefit to per-share earnings.\n\nStarbucks shares had run up 47% during the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, including a 12.8% rise in the third fiscal quarter, which ended in June, a 15.4% jump in the second quarter and a 13.3% gain in the first quarter.\n\nSince the end of the third quarter, the stock has risen another 14.7%. It closed at a record $99.11 on July 26.\n\nIn comparison, the SPDR Consumer Discretionary Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLY, -2.04% has gained 0.9% since the end of June and the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.94% has lost 4.0%.\n\nIncluding a $2 billion accelerated-share-repurchase agreement effective in March, Starbucks said in its most recent quarterly filing that it had spent $8 billion to buy back 116.1 million shares during the first three quarters of fiscal 2019. That represented about 9.4% of the shares outstanding as of the end of fiscal 2018.\n\nAs of June 30, about 52.7 million shares remained available for repurchase under the current buyback program.\n\nBernstein analyst Sara Senatore said she didn\u2019t believe investors weren\u2019t too surprised by the lowered guidance, given that tax benefits and share-repurchase plans were telegraphed.\n\n\u201cThe timing of the update is a bit puzzling given the company reported [third-quarter] results less than six weeks ago and did not update guidance then, though the decision to provide explicit guidance may reflect consensus\u2019s failure to model accordingly,\u201d Senatore wrote in a note to clients.\n\nGrismer stressed that despite the lowered EPS-growth outlook, Starbucks was \u201cfiring on all cylinders\u201d from an operating-performance perspective. He affirmed the revenue-growth guidance range of 7% to 9% for 2020, while the FactSet revenue consensus for 2020 of $28.42 billion implies 7.6% growth over the 2019 consensus of $26.42 billion.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Starbucks traffic gets a boost from customers who aren\u2019t loyalty members\n\nAlso read: That \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 coffee cup is worth at least $250,000 to Starbucks\n\n\u201cAll in, while there doesn\u2019t appear to be any change in [Starbucks\u2019s] broader fundamental outlook \u2026, these adjustments are a reminder that the [Starbucks] story is complicated and that growth is not always poised to proceed in a linear fashion,\u201d analyst Bonnie Herzog at Wells Fargo wrote in a note to clients.", "description": "Shares of Starbucks Corp. slumped Wednesday after the coffee seller warned that 2020 profit growth will be below its target, citing a \u201cpull forward\u201d of about...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ658_Starbu_ZG_20190904111020.jpg"}
