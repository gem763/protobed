Of course not. I understand what it means to the fans to be behind City and Liverpool, and I cannot be happy about this. I prefer to focus on us rather than thinking about our rivals.\"\n\nUnited's draw with Liverpool on Sunday means they finished the weekend in 13th place in the table, already 15 points behind the league leaders with just nine games played, and it looks as though it will be another season where their supporters are looking enviously at their superior rivals.\n\n(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's side now face a run of four consecutive away fixtures as they look for their first win on the road since beating Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League in March, starting with a trip to Serbia to take on FK Partizan in the Europa League on Thursday.", "description": "United's two biggest rivals have both enjoyed themselves in recent times while the Red Devils have struggled", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Getty Images", "Manchester United Via Getty Imag"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20540573.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
