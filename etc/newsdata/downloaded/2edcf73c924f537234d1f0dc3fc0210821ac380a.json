That\u2019s all that a baseball team can dream of, right?\n\nSo how did Dave Dombrowski go from presiding over that to being on the unemployment line in less than 11 months?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSome of it is the result of self-inflicted wounds. The Red Sox entered the offseason knowing that they\u2019d probably lose Craig Kimbrel and would thus have to address their bullpen problems. They also had a couple of postseason heroes \u2014 Nathan Eovaldi and Steve Pearce \u2014 hitting free agency. Dombrowski spent a good deal of money on Eovaldi and Pearce and almost no money on addressing the bullpen, figuring Alex Cora would work some magic with spare parts and that he\u2019d fix it on the fly if need be. Both of those gambles failed pretty badly.\n\nThose moves alone should not have ended Dombrowski\u2019s tenure, though. And they didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think. Some bad luck definitely contributed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere has been some natural regression, obviously. No 108-win team isn\u2019t going to see that. The rotation has been shaky, with said gamble on Eovaldi, perhaps not surprisingly, not working out, Chris Sale struggling, Rick Porcello cratering and David Price proving less effective than he was last year. It wasn\u2019t the worst plan to enter 2019 like the Sox did, but the plan hasn\u2019t survived engagement with the enemy. Mookie Betts and J.D. Martinez have gone from MVP-caliber last year to merely good or, sometimes, very good this year. Some others have improved, but overall the offense has slid from best in the league to fourth-best and when your pitching betrays you, that\u2019s gonna be felt. Championship teams sometimes experience hangovers and the Sox have experienced one in 2019.\n\nWhat probably killed Dombrowski, though, was just how expensive this hangover happens to be and how expensive it would likely be for the Red Sox to cure it with Dombrowski at the helm.\n\nWhile the Red Sox have the highest payroll in baseball and have shown that they are willing to spend money to win, even the owner of the very, very rich Boston Red Sox doesn\u2019t have a ton of patience for expensive mistakes. Here was what he said about deciding to spend big money around the time of the London Series last June:\n\nIt\u2019s a question of how much money do we want to lose. We\u2019re already over budget and we were substantially over our budget last year and this year. We\u2019re not going to be looking to add a lot of payroll. And it\u2019s hard to imagine fielding a better team. If we play up to our capabilities we\u2019ll be fine. That\u2019s the question: Will we? We\u2019re halfway through and we haven\u2019t. \u2026 It\u2019s a worthy team because we invested. Two years in a row we have the highest payroll. It\u2019s not a matter of investment, it\u2019s a matter of playing well. If we play up to our capabilities we will easily make the playoffs. That\u2019s how I see it.\n\nTranslation: \u201cI\u2019m OK with spending money as long as we\u2019re winning, but I\u2019m not if we\u2019re losing.\u201d Which seems fairly reasonable, of course. It\u2019s certainly a preferable world view to some other ownership groups around the game who seem happier spending less and losing than spending more and winning. But it does show that John Henry has his limits. Based on Dombrowski\u2019s firing, it\u2019d appear that letting Dombrowski spend his way out of the trouble the club is in at the moment is beyond his limits.\n\nAnd really, that\u2019s what you\u2019d have to expect were Dombrowski\u2019s plans. It\u2019s his m.o. It\u2019s what he did to bring that trophy to Boston, really, with his predecessor Ben Cherington building the base and Dombrowski going out and acquiring the big pieces like Sale and Kimbrel and Martinez to put the club over the top. Dombrowski has always done well with the big splash and the bold moves, with his work on Boston over the past few years serving as his best performance in that regard.\n\nWhile he built strong organizations in Montreal, Miami and, in the early going, in Detroit, making more modest, incremental moves to address problem areas less expensively is not a skill set Dombrowski has shown in the latter part of his career. When the Tigers seemed close to stalling out he\u2019d make big and expensive moves, all while hoping they\u2019d paper over the problem areas (i.e. the perpetually underperforming bullpen). Some bad luck and some bad bounces kept that from working out. Even if they had worked out, though, in the end the bill would\u2019ve come due either way, and it did with a vengeance in Detroit.\n\nVery soon the Red Sox are going to have to pay Mookie Betts and Jackie Bradley Jr. some big money or figure out how to live without them if they prove unwilling to do so. The bullpen needs an overhaul. Chris Sale\u2019s shoulder may or may not be a long term concern. We\u2019re also getting to the point where Porcello and Price become too old to expect their up-and-down cycle to always return to \u201cup.\u201d The Red Sox are still enormously talented, but there is no team, however talented, for which you can just lash the wheel, sit back in the captain\u2019s chair and expect things to stay on course. Adjustments have to be made pretty regularly, and the Red Sox, even less than a year removed from a championship, need to make some adjustments.\n\nDombrowski did what he was expected to do in delivering another championship to Boston. But there\u2019s not a ton of reason to believe he\u2019s the guy who can make efficient and refined, as opposed expensive and broad course adjustments. John Henry is well aware of how letting Dombrowski try to work his way through problems in Detroit worked out for the Tigers and doesn\u2019t want to see that happen to the Red Sox. He has shown he\u2019ll spend money, but he said last June he won\u2019t do it frivolously.\n\nIt would appear that his faith in Dombrowski to carry out that brief was too low and thus he canned him.", "description": "The best guess: John Henry does not have the patience for expensive solutions to expensive problems", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eZ.Of39PHrGF0BgByL563g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjIuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/svEOdvRnA.L9eq5TA8wm9Q--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkxNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/46b6ad24412225156c3716943f45db81", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
