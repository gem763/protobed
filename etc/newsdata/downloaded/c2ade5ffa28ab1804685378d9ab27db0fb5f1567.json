He explained, rambled, apologized, rambled some more, teared up, and announced that \u201cI have spent the last five days crying in Argentina.\u201d Whether the \u201cEvita\u201d allusion was deliberate or not has always been a mystery.\n\nMr. Sanford\u2019s marriage fell apart; he is no longer engaged to his Argentine girlfriend, having announced the demise of their relationship via a 2,346-word Facebook post several years ago. It has been a hard experience to live down. \u201cThere was public shame,\u201d said Mr. Sanford, who has a habit of talking about himself in the second person, and who still takes the More is More approach to discussions of his private life. \u201cThere was public failure. You wish you could redo a lot of the things you did.\u201d\n\nAfter the football game, he was being driven back to Charleston, where he has a house (he also has a farm an hour away). The driver was John McKinney, a 23-year-old graduate of Eastern Kentucky University who, at least at that moment, constituted a full 50 percent of Mr. Sanford\u2019s campaign staff. After reading on Twitter that Mr. Sanford wanted to run, he said, he had felt energized by the candidate\u2019s desire to bring the Republican Party back to its core values. He called the next day to sign up.\n\nIt was unclear how much money Mr. McKinney could hope to earn from working for Mr. Sanford, who is facing some fund-raising challenges.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to recognize in this endeavor \u2014 from a capital standpoint, you\u2019re going to be deprived of the big spenders, because no one\u2019s going to risk going against Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Sanford said. \u201cThe A Team is not going to work for you, and even the B Team isn\u2019t going to do something that might end in a few months.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean you\u2019re on the C Team,\u201d he said to Mr. McKinney, who was trying to negotiate the chaotic drive away from the football stadium. \u201cYou want to get in the left lane now, so we can turn.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI know at many levels how uphill and long-shot and David-and-Goliath this is,\u201d he said. He\u2019s still going to try.", "authors": ["Sarah Lyall"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/us/politics/24sanford1/24sanford1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
