He makes guys miss. He breaks the pocket, and there will be guys chasing him everywhere. He knows what to do with the ball - dish it out, go to a checkdown. He makes plays. He\u2019s a playmaker, and that\u2019s what you need in a guy and at the quarterback position. That\u2019s what he is.\u201d\n\nJackson and Wilson will meet on the field or the first time on Sunday when the Seahawks host the Ravens in a showdown between two of the better teams in each conference and two of the early MVP candidates.\n\nJackson has wowed with his combination of running and passing. He\u2019s on pace to rush for 1,200 yards and throw for 4,000. Last week, he became the first player in league history to throw for more than 200 yards and rush for more than 150 in the same regular season game.\n\nJackson is completing 65% of his passes, has 13 touchdowns passing and rushing and causing nightmares for opposing defenses.\n\n\u201cPeople always mention his speed. That\u2019s obvious. But I think the mixture of all the different things he can do - he can throw it down the field, he\u2019s tough, he hangs in there, he\u2019s a smart player too,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou put all those things together with his elusiveness, which is as good as it gets, probably best you\u2019ve ever seen kind of speed, he\u2019s really special.\u201d\n\nWhere Wilson has impressed is his overall command of Seattle\u2019s offense. He\u2019s just the fourth QB in league history to start the season with six straight games with a passer rating of 100 or higher. He hasn\u2019t thrown an interception since Week 17 of last season. Wilson is playing with a confidence and savvy that\u2019s flashed at times throughout his career, but perhaps never for such a prolonged period.\n\n\u201cI know he\u2019s deep in the conversation for the MVP already,\u201d Baltimore coach John Harbaugh said. \u201cWe hope, and we\u2019re going to do everything we can, to make sure that we don\u2019t make that argument any stronger, or help make that argument any stronger.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what else to watch as the Seahawks and Ravens meet for the first time since 2015:\n\nMY NAME IS EARL\n\nAside from the quarterbacks, the biggest story line is the return of safety Earl Thomas, who spent his first nine seasons with Seattle before signing with Baltimore in free agency. Thomas was a star with the Seahawks, a founding member of the \u201cLegion of Boom\u201d secondary and a three-time first-team All-Pro selection. The final image of Thomas with Seattle was being carted off the field last season after breaking his leg in Arizona and flashing the middle finger at Seahawks coach Pete Carroll, angry about not getting a contract extension with the Seahawks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what this game is going to bring, but I definitely respect and love the organization. They gave me my first shot,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nBACKFIELD IN MOTION\n\nThe Ravens have been forced to shuffle their defensive backfield this season to cope with injuries to Tavon Young, Tony Jefferson, DeShon Elliott and Jimmy Smith. First-year general manager Eric DeCosta refurbished the secondary this week by trading for two-time Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters and signing safety Bennett Jackson from the Jets practice squad.\n\nBoth newcomers are expected to play Sunday, so it\u2019s imperative that they work in unison with cornerbacks Marlon Humphrey and Brandon Carr, as well as Thomas.\n\n\u201cCommunication is going to be really critical, especially there,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be quite as loud, because their offense will be on the field, maybe as it would be here. But it\u2019s a loud place, and you\u2019re on the road. It\u2019s terminology.\u201d\n\nWELCOME BACK\n\nSeattle should get a boost on its defensive line with the return of Jarran Reed after he was suspended for the first six games. Reed had 10\u00bd sacks last season, but more important will be his ability to draw attention and potentially open up more on the outside for Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah. Seattle has just 10 sacks through six games and didn\u2019t have a quarterback hit recorded last week against Cleveland.\n\nThe task this week isn\u2019t so much getting pressure on Jackson as it is keeping the elusive QB contained.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we come out here to practice, to get a feel of each other,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe talked a long time. We\u2019re going to get out here. We\u2019re going to work together. We\u2019re going to build that chemistry together.\u201d\n\nHIGH VOLUME\n\nThe Ravens cranked up the music at practice this week to simulate the crowd noise at CenturyLink Field. Jackson played in packed stadiums while at Louisville, and he\u2019s twice started in Kansas City against the Chiefs. But playing in Seattle is taking it to another (sound) level.\n\n\u201cThe coaches have been telling us it\u2019s very loud,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI just have to do a good job of executing, calling out the plays and letting everyone hear me.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There is an understandable mutual admiration between Baltimore's Lamar Jackson and Seattle's Russell Wilson.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/bengals_ravens_football_23328_c0-202-4857-3035_s1200x700.jpg?5a5bbc6e5cc6f1a615d9f339e2516f9b24a2bc60", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
