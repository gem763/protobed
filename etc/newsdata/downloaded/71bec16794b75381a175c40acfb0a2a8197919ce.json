That\u2019s what happened to this couple in Malaysia who ended their night with a car chase after police caught them getting frisky in their vehicle.\n\nThe unnamed college students aged 19 and 25 were busy getting it on when a police officer tapped on their car window in Penang on Saturday, Oct. 19, Asia One reported. The police were inspecting cars parked along an emergency lane when they found the couple.\n\nUpon seeing the officer, the couple panicked and immediately sped off, resulting in a high-speed car chase.\n\nAs they were trying to escape, the driver lost control of the car and crashed into a toll booth railing. This caused them to knock over a motorcyclist before their vehicle fell off the highway and into a large drain. The vehicle sank and the couple was rescued by the police before getting arrested.\n\nThey came out unscathed from the crash but the motorcyclist wasn\u2019t as lucky, sustaining broken legs. He was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.\n\n\"The couple's unusual behaviour raised suspicion, prompting the police to chase them,\" Seberang Perai North District Police Chief Assistant Commissioner Noorikane Mohd Noor told My Metro.\n\nThe lovers were not under the influence of drugs or other substances but the police are looking into charging them for reckless driving.\n\nFind Lia on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "The climax of this story was not what they expected.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5daffbbed9730e008daccc2a/lede/1571815302925-CAR-CHASE-1.jpeg?crop=0.888888888888889xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
