It gave few details beyond denying an imminent release of the currency.\n\nNumerous industry sources and media outlets had reported that Beijing was close to unveiling the digital payment system, and said the process had been accelerated by Facebook\u2019s FB, -1.64% announcement that it would release its own currency, called Libra.\n\nBest New Ideas in Money: Silicon Valley\u2019s final frontier for mobile payments \u2014 \u2018the neoliberal takeover of the human body\u2019\n\nChina would become the first major country to issue a digital version of its currency if the digital currency is released.\n\nIt is also unclear if the apparent postponement is the result of reshuffling at the PBOC. Two weeks ago, central-bank veteran Mu Changchun was elevated to head of the PBOC\u2019s digital-currency research institute. Mu has been a strong proponent of the currency and last month said it was \u201cclose to being released.\u201d\n\nMu also said in August that the currency will be based on a two-tier system similar to that used to produce minted money, with the PBOC producing and managing the currency, then issuing it to commercial banks and other entities, which then circulate it to consumers.\n\nBut unlike bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.39% , China\u2019s digital currency is unlikely to rely on blockchain technology, Mu said, which may not be able to support the enormous volume of transactions that take place at any given moment.\n\nChina\u2019s creation of its own digital currency was spearheaded by a former central-bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, who retired last year. Though many transactions in China are already digital \u2014 through the use of Alipay and WeChat \u2014 PBOC officials have reportedly been concerned that nascent online currencies could leave the country vulnerable or reduce the government\u2019s control over issuance.\n\nMu echoed comments Zhou made over the summer that different agencies should be competing to win acceptance of what technology is used, and that multiple government institutions were developing their own road maps for the payment system. Whether this interagency competition is at the center of the delay is also unknown.\n\nUnlike the U.S. and much of Europe, China largely leapfrogged the credit-card era, with payments moving from cash straight into digital wallets \u00e0 la Alipay and Tencent. Alipay, which is run by Alibaba BABA, -3.03% affiliate Ant Financial, now processes roughly half of mobile payments in China, while Tencent\u2019s TCEHY, +0.23% 700, -0.53% WeChat Pay handles just under 40%, according to Beijing-based research firm Analysys.\n\nThe widespread adoption of mobile payments in China means consumers are unlikely to experience significant disruptions once a digital currency is rolled out. Most changes will be at the government and lending levels, allowing institutions greater control over issuing and tracking exchanges, and could help in detecting money laundering and other illicit activities.\n\nRead on: How to invest in \u2014 or avoid \u2014 what makes China, China\n\nTanner Brown is director of real-time news at Caixin Global in Beijing.", "description": "PBOC says November release date is inaccurate, and Alipay and Tencent won\u2019t be among the first players.", "authors": ["Tanner Brown"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FZ031_PBOC_ZG_20171127113404.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
