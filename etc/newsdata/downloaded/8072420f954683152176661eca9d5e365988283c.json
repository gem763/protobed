The video series is called \u201cUnderstand AD Squad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like not enough people know what AD is. So when they see it, they have mixed feelings or they don\u2019t know how to react,\u201d Mr. Dixon said. \u201cBut if they knew what it is, I feel like there would be less bad reactions to kids or people with AD.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy hope out of this is to raise a broader range of awareness and allow people to be educated on what it\u2019s like and how it affects people\u2019s daily lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a rash on one spot on your arm or your leg. It\u2019s severe.\u201d\n\nMore than 18 million Americans live with atopic dermatitis, which causes a rash that usually develops on the cheeks, arms and legs, according to the National Eczema Association, which released the five-part video series Wednesday on its website and social media channels.\n\nJulie Block, the association\u2019s president and CEO, said the videos articulate the unique challenges teenagers living with atopic dermatitis can face such as peer interactions, school performance, inability to participate in certain activities and issues with self esteem.\n\nChristine Triano, a licensed clinical social worker based in Pasadena, California, described atopic dermatitis as a chronic condition that can cause anxiety, depression, poor sleep and mental health issues. She said students with AD might skip school and avoid social outings and other activities because of flare-ups.\n\nIsaiah\u2019s parents, Lori and Reggie Dixon, said their son is unable to participate in sports such as swimming and many indoor and outdoor activities because of the risk of flare-ups, which they stressed are not contagious. Isaiah was diagnosed with AD when he was 2 years old.\n\n\u201cIt excludes you from a lot of activities,\u201d Mrs. Dixon said.\n\nThe constant scratching that the skin condition invites also makes it difficult for Isaiah to sleep.\n\nThe cause of atopic dermatitis is unknown, but there is a genetic disposition, said Dr. Mercedes Gonzalez, who works at Pediatric Dermatology in Miami.\n\nShe said AD occurs when the skin cells swell and water leaves them. That can lead to itching and uncontrollable scratching, which creates a risk of infection due to skin breakage.\n\nWhile eczema is associated with food allergies, it is not caused by them, Dr. Gonzalez said, noting a common misconception that people can outgrow the condition.\n\nTyler Berryman, 25, of San Jose, California, also is featured in \u201cUnderstand AD Squad.\u201d He said the series\u2019 talking points include the transition from being a teen with eczema to being a young adult and the social interactions those with atopic dermatitis might encounter.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think some of the problems sometimes when we have atopic dermatitis, especially as a teen and young adult, is that it can feel very lonely,\u201d Mr. Berryman said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t talk about stuff like this a lot. It\u2019s very personal.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that eczema does not define a person, commenting on how he wants the public to understand that people living with AD have to build their lives around the skin condition.\n\nFor those living with eczema, Mr. Berryman said it\u2019s important to establish a skin care routine and to have an outlet, whether that\u2019s playing the drums or reading.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not easy to do all the living stuff, especially when you\u2019re in the middle of flare ups and you\u2019ve still got to put on clothes and be uncomfortable and be self conscious or whatever and still go do things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth it. And that doesn\u2019t mean that person isn\u2019t worth it either.\u201d\n\nMs. Block said she hopes the video series elicits compassion from the public while inspiring those with eczema to seek support and persist to create a customized treatment plan that works for them.\n\nFor Isaiah Dixon, part of his approach for handling his atopic dermatitis is simply self acceptance.\n\n\u201cThe way I want to deal with it is just to love who I am,\u201d he said, sitting next to his mother. \u201cFrom both loving who I am and being OK with my condition, I have this drive to be better and to be better physically.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
