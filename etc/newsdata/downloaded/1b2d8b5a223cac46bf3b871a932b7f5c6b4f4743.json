One of her eight deputies, in charge of migration, education and security, was given the title \u201cVice-President-Designate for Protecting our European Way of Life.\u201d\n\nAnother, from Croatia, will become vice president for \u201cDemocracy and Demography,\u201d while a third is tipped to be in charge of \u201cInterinstitutional Relations and Foresight.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you see the expression \u201cour European way of life\u201d as inclusive or xenophobic? Why? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe commission, the executive branch of the European Union, drafts regulations, imposes fines and negotiates trade deals, among other responsibilities. Mrs. von der Leyen has pledged to lead a \u201cgeopolitical commission\u201d able to face down competition from China and the U.S.\n\nShe needs support from parliamentary political leaders to get her team of 26 commissioners voted into office in the coming weeks. If she stands firm on the titles, as she has pledged to, she could face delays in taking office as planned on Nov. 1.\n\nAlongside the title fight, some lawmakers have raised ethics questions about several designated commissioners. The parliament will hold three-hour hearings for each of the 26 nominees in the first week of October before deciding whether to approve or reject them for the proposed posts.\n\nLawmakers in European Parliament have the power to force Mrs. von der Leyen to reshuffle her team. Photo: vincent kessler/Reuters\n\nLawmakers have the power\u2014and have used it with previous commissioners\u2014to force Mrs. von der Leyen to reshuffle her team or ask countries to send new candidates. Newly proposed commissioners would then need to be screened, further delaying the process.\n\nMrs. von der Leyen has made several promises for her first 100 days in office, including new regulations on technology and the green economy.\n\n\u201cOf course, words matter,\u201d she said in an op-ed published on Monday in several European newspapers, her first since EU leaders picked her for the job in July. \u201cFor some, the European way of life is a loaded and politically charged term. But we cannot and must not let others take away our language from us: This is also part of who we are.\u201d\n\nOne day earlier, France\u2019s nationalist and anti-immigrant leader Marine Le Pen said the migration commissioner\u2019s title \u201cconfirms our ideological victory\u201d and that the EU was \u201cforced to admit that immigration poses questions about the future of Europeans\u2019 way of life.\u201d\n\nMrs. von der Leyen\u2019s ally in the European Parliament, German lawmaker Manfred Weber, who leads the center-right caucus in the house, on Tuesday defended the \u201ccorrect definition of the European way of life, which is to rescue people in the Mediterranean, and not to close harbors.\u201d\n\nMr. Weber also sparked outrage when asking reporters: \u201cIs there someone in the room who wants to live the Chinese way of life, the African way of life or the American way of life?\u201d\n\nCentrist, left-wing and Green politicians in the parliament have criticized the migration commissioner\u2019s title and said Mrs. von der Leyen must change it or face trouble during the hearings.\n\nThe current commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, also pitched in. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea that the European way of life is opposed to migration,\u201d he told broadcaster Euronews last week.\n\nMrs. von der Leyen maintains that the European way of life refers to fundamental values and human rights.\n\n\u201cWe have seen foreign powers interfere in our elections\u2026and we have seen homegrown populists with cheap nationalistic slogans try to destabilize us from the inside,\u201d she wrote in the op-ed. \u201cWe should not allow these forces to hijack the definition of the European way of life.\u201d\n\nWhile some EU officials suggested it was a mistake for Mrs. von der Leyen to double down on a potentially poisonous identity debate, some analysts said it speaks to her character.\n\nGiven that she was appointed with the support of conservative governments in central and Eastern Europe, Mrs. von der Leyen made a conscious decision to alienate left-wing rather than right-wing politicians, said Camino Mortera-Martinez, a senior research fellow with the Centre for European Reform, a London-based think tank.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s much less a compromise figure than people thought,\u201d Ms. Mortera-Martinez said.\n\nWrite to Valentina Pop at valentina.pop@wsj.com", "description": "Partisan bickering between Europe\u2019s left and right is threatening to engulf the once-insulated technocratic institutions of the European Commission as new leaders take charge.", "authors": ["Valentina Pop", "Valentina.Pop Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108408/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
