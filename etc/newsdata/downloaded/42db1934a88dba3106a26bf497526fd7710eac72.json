The move came only days after Blizzard created an international political incident after a high-profile player staged a protest in the same manner. They were asking Blizzard to blink: ban us, too.\n\nAt the time, nothing happened to American University team members Casey Chambers, Corwin Dark, and their third teammate, who goes by the online handle TJammer. Blizzard cut away from the sign, and the casters assigned to the stream pretended like nothing happened. (In the original incident, the casters hid under their desks during the protest, and Blizzard, even after taking time to reconsider, still rewarded them with a six-month ban.)\n\nBut Blizzard\u2019s silence towards Chambers and his friends always had a ticking time limit; despite losing a tournament round, they were scheduled to play again. Blizzard\u2019s response came last night, only a few days after the company publicly doubled down on a series of disciplinary actions against Chung \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Ng Wai, who originally set this into motion.\n\nIn a letter to Chambers, Blizzard said that while \u201cEvery Voice Matters at Blizzard, and we strongly encourage everyone in our community to share their viewpoints in the many places available to express themselves,\u201d an official broadcast was that not that venue, as it needs to be a place \u201cwhere all are welcome.\u201d To Blizzard, supporting the protests violates that, a reaction that\u2019s perfectly in line with Blizzard\u2019s ongoing \u201cpolitics is fine, just not here\u201d mantra.\n\nAs a result, the three players were given a six-month competitive ban, the same as Blitzchung. While Blitzchung was originally banned for a year, one of the few concessions from Blizzard\u2019s open letter to the community on Friday was ratcheting down a yearlong ban.\n\n\n\nBlizzard also published their decision online.\n\n\u201cWe knew exactly what we were doing,\u201d said Chambers to me over Discord this morning. \u201cNo regrets.\u201d\n\nAs teased in a piece with VICE Games last week, this incident resulted in Chambers starting to play God\u2019s Unchained, a Hearthstone competitor that openly criticized Blizzard after taking action against Blitzchung. Chambers said the team behind God\u2019s Unchained reached out after the three players took their public stand, saying they \u201csupport\u201d them and wouldn\u2019t have a problem if, in the future, they decided to talk about the Hong Kong protests in public.\n\nBlizzard hasn\u2019t said anything since last week\u2019s late night news dump, but BlizzCon, the company\u2019s annual community event, is only weeks away. BlizzCon kicks off on November 1.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter. If you work at Blizzard and want to reach out anonymously, drop an email: patrick.klepek@vice.com.
