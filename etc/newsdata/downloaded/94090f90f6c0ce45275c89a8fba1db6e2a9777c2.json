This is a reprehensible and un-American view. It would make Trump not a president but a king \u2014 utterly beyond the reach of the law.\n\nTrump is increasingly becoming addicted to his claims of legal immunity. The analogy is intentional \u2014 like an addict, he seeks higher and higher doses to reach legal oblivion. His first foray was to assert that he could not be indicted as a sitting president, relying on two long-standing Justice Department opinions, which is how he escaped consideration of criminal charges by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. But it has since escalated. Trump has argued that his current advisers can\u2019t be required to testify before Congress; that his former White House advisers can\u2019t be required to testify before Congress; that executive privilege protects even former advisers who never worked in the White House from testifying before Congress; that his administration needn\u2019t comply with congressional subpoenas seeking documents; and that he needn\u2019t provide his tax returns in response to state law requiring them. But he has now gone beyond that, too, claiming \u2014 most astonishingly \u2014 that he needn\u2019t participate in any way, including letting government witnesses testify, in the impeachment inquiry undertaken by the House of Representatives to scrutinize his actions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne way to think about the constraints on presidential wrongdoing is using the three I\u2019s: investigation, indictment and impeachment. Any constitutional scholar who thinks one is not available, like indictment, argues to increase the power of the other two to make up for the distortion. So scholars who believe a sitting president cannot be indicted couple that view to a belief that investigation and impeachment must be readily available. And vice versa. No serious person contends that all three are not available.\n\nThat is why Trump keeps losing court cases, including one earlier this month in a major rebuke handed down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. But Trump\u2019s argument this week took things to another level. He was in court to block a subpoena issued by New York prosecutors to Trump\u2019s accounting firm seeking financial records relating to hush-money payments made before the 2016 election \u2014 that is, when Trump was a private citizen, before he was president. One of the judges hearing the case, testing just how far Trump\u2019s claim of presidential immunity from investigation reached, asked whether, if Trump really did shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue as he\u2019d proposed hypothetically on the campaign trail in 2016, \u201clocal authorities couldn\u2019t investigate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d Trump attorney William Consovoy replied.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat is actually not correct \u2014 not by the Justice Department\u2019s own logic, which has been the underlying rationale for many of Trump\u2019s claims of immunity up to now. It\u2019s true that the Justice Department continues to take the position that a sitting president can\u2019t be criminally prosecuted or even indicted, based largely on the notion that the Constitution provides a different remedy for scrutinizing a president while in office: impeachment. But the department\u2019s opinion on this issue doesn\u2019t say that a president can\u2019t be investigated. Indeed, it says precisely the opposite, explicitly recognizing that a \u201cgrand jury could continue to gather evidence during the period of immunity\u201d a sitting president enjoys, \u201ceven passing this task down to subsequently empaneled grand juries if necessary.\u201d That\u2019s critical, the opinion says, for \u201csecuring and preserving evidence\u201d \u2014 thus laying the groundwork for charging and prosecuting a president after he or she has left office.\n\nConsovoy\u2019s claim also runs headlong into the legal position espoused earlier this month by Trump\u2019s own White House counsel. The central argument against allowing a sitting president to be charged and prosecuted is that impeachment offers the appropriate, alternative mechanism for considering whether a president has engaged in improprieties. But Trump\u2019s top White House lawyer wrote to Congress claiming that the president \u201ccannot participate\u201d in the impeachment inquiry. That argument rested, in part, on the fact that impeachment doesn\u2019t offer all of the procedural protections available in the criminal context.\n\nTrump wants to have it both ways: He rejects a criminal investigation because impeachment is available, and he rejects an impeachment inquiry because it\u2019s not a criminal investigation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUltimately, Trump was in court this week to defend a single premise: Donald Trump is above the law \u2014 not just as president but as a person and a businessman. His central argument for resisting the subpoena issued by New York prosecutors was that there is no way to distinguish any of Trump\u2019s activities, even his financial activities before becoming president, from the office Trump now holds, an office that furnishes him with certain immunities. L\u2019etat, c\u2019est moi, as Louis XIV would have it: I am the state.\n\nThat\u2019s a plausible position for a king (though even for monarchs, it has been out of fashion for several centuries). But it\u2019s an outrageous one for a president. It\u2019s in direct conflict with the views of the president\u2019s own Justice Department and White House counsel. And it should be rejected in court \u2014 swiftly \u2014 to ensure that, in the United States, no one is above the law.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The president is arguing that he\u2019s completely above the law.
