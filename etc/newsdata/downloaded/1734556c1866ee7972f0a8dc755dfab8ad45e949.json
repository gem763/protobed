The company also gave lower-than-anticipated current-quarter guidance amid rising competition in the food delivery space.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, GRUB CEO Matt Maloney said the firm will be \"spending more and trying many different strategies over the next 12-18 months,\" including \"investing aggressively in our independent restaurant sales organization.\" This plan has drawn a quick reaction from analysts, with Guggenheim downgrading GrubHub stock to \"neutral\" from \"buy,\" saying the strategy is \"unproven,\" and creates \"greater uncertainty.\"\n\nCraig-Hallum also lowered its rating on GRUB shares, to \"hold\" from \"buy,\" and slashed its price target by $60 to $40. Prior to today, most analysts were bullish on the equity, with 13 maintaining a \"strong buy\" rating, compared to eight \"holds,\" and one \"strong sell.\" Meanwhile, the average 12-month price target of $81.42 is still a 56.7% premium to current levels.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, GRUB stock hit a two-year low of $35.15 out of the gate, and was last seen down 39.6% to trade at $35.26. This puts the equity on the short-sale restricted list, and has options activity running hot in early trading. Already today, roughly 21,000 contracts have crossed -- a near-even split between calls and puts -- surpassing the average daily volume of 9,045 options. The November 35 put is most active, and new positions are being initiated here.", "description": "Analysts have been quick to chime in after GRUB earnings", "authors": ["Karee Venema"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
