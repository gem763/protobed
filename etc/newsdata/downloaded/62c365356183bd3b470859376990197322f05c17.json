It's hard to think of anything which better illustrates this Govt's contempt for people, Parliament & democracy.\"\n\nOminously for the government, some lawmakers who support the Brexit deal said they would vote against the short timetable.\n\n\"Unless you are prepared to contemplate more expansive debate, there is not the slightest possibility of considering the deal that has been obtained within the time available,\" Ken Clarke, a senior lawmaker recently ousted from Johnson's Conservative Party group in Parliament, told the Guardian newspaper.\n\nIf the government loses the timetable vote, it could either agree to a longer period of scrutiny \u2014 all but guaranteeing Brexit won't happen on Oct. 31 \u2014 or withdraw the legislation, go back to square one and try to hold an election to break the political impasse.\n\nThe showdown comes just nine days before Britain's scheduled departure date. Johnson's government had sought a \"straight up-and-down vote\" Monday on the agreement he struck last week with the 27 other EU nations laying out the terms of Britain's exit.\n\nBut the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, refused to allow it because lawmakers voted to delay approving the Brexit deal on Saturday, and parliamentary rules bar the same measure from being considered a second time during a session of Parliament unless something has changed.\n\nBercow's ruling plunged the tortuous Brexit process back into grimly familiar territory: acrimonious uncertainty.\n\nJohnson's only hope of securing Britain's departure on Oct. 31, as he has long promised, is to pass the Brexit-implementing bill through Britain's fractious Parliament before then.\n\nJohnson's Conservatives hold just 288 of the 650 House of Commons seats, so he will need support from opposition and independent lawmakers to pass the bill.\n\nThe bill turns the deal Johnson struck with the EU into law. It sets out the terms of Britain's departure, including measures to maintain an open border between the U.K.'s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. It also enshrines the right of U.K. and EU citizens living in the other's territory to continue with their lives, and sets out the multi-billion pound (dollar) payments Britain must make to meet its financial obligations to the EU.\n\nIt also confirms a transition period lasting until at least the end of 2020 \u2014 and possibly 2022 \u2014 in which relations will remain frozen as they are now while a permanent new relationship is worked out.\n\nOpposition lawmakers plan to seek amendments that could substantially alter the bill, for example by adding a requirement that the Brexit deal be put to voters in a new referendum, or by requiring the government to extend the transition period until a new trade deal with the EU has been agreed.\n\nThe government says such major amendments would wreck its legislation and it will withdraw the bill if the opposition plan succeeds.\n\nWith the Brexit deadline looming and British politicians still squabbling over the country's departure terms, Johnson has been forced to ask the EU for a three-month delay to Britain's departure date.\n\nHe did that, grudgingly, to comply with a law passed by Parliament ordering the government to postpone Brexit rather than risk the economic damage that could come from a no-deal exit.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said Tuesday that EU leaders \"will decide in coming days\" whether to grant Britain another extension to the deadline for leaving the bloc, but said their decision depends on developments in London.\n\nTusk said Tuesday that the decision on prolonging Brexit for three months after Oct. 31. \"will very much depend on what the British parliament decides or doesn't decide.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nLorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this story.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP's full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
