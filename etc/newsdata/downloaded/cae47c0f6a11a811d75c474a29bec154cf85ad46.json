I\u2019m with 69-year-old Gerry Collins at his small, untidy one-bedroom flat in Tulse Hill, South London.\n\nHe is still wearing pyjama bottoms. I notice because the thin cotton fabric seems to draw attention to his twig-like legs.\n\nHe\u2019s now strong enough to make the five steps from his bed to an armchair, he announces proudly.\n\nAt the beginning of this year he\u2019d attempted the journey unaided but promptly collapsed in a heap.\n\nMore than a million Britons are at risk, because they aren\u2019t having enough to eat (stock image)\n\nAnd this was after a six-week spell in hospital intended to nurse him back to health.\n\nI\u2019m here with Michelle Duffy, a dietician from Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital in South London. She\u2019s checking in on him as part of a community project to combat malnutrition in older adults.\n\nThere\u2019s a younger Gerry in photographs on the walls: a stocky, 14st man \u2013 virtually unrecognisable from the sharp, sunken face that sits before me. Gerry, who lives alone, suffers with serious heart problems.\n\nIn the months leading up to the fall that landed him in hospital, he stopped eating properly.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d have maybe two meals a day. Maybe cornflakes in the morning and frozen chips for dinner,\u2019 he says. He separated from his wife eight years ago. \u2018I didn\u2019t really bother to cook for myself often. When you\u2019re by yourself, it\u2019s a lot of effort,\u2019 he adds.\n\nDuring his hospital stay, Gerry, who once worked in printing, lost his appetite completely.\n\n\u2018I knew I needed to eat to get better, but I couldn\u2019t muster the energy,\u2019 he remembers. \u2018It didn\u2019t matter how nice the food was, I felt sick and didn\u2019t want to eat it.\u2019\n\nOne man in his 70s was so malnourished that he couldn\u2019t muster the energy to walk from the bedroom to the front door for more than six months (stock image)\n\nBy the time he was discharged in December 2018, he weighed just under 9st and was too weak to move from his bed.\n\nHe was referred to Michelle Duffy\u2019s team at the Lambeth and Southwark Action on Malnutrition Project.\n\nWith the help of regular visits, meal plans and high-calorie food supplements, Gerry has gained more than a stone.\n\nBut Michelle tells me there are hundreds more Gerrys in the two-mile radius alone. One man in his 70s was so malnourished that he couldn\u2019t muster the energy to walk from the bedroom to the front door for more than six months.\n\nAnother dietician tells me of a woman who suffered starvation-induced delirium and collapsed inside her flat. A carer found her in the same position 48 hours later.\n\nOn further investigation it would seem this is happening up and down the country. It is a problem you might associate with developing countries. Yet more than a million Britons are at risk, because they aren\u2019t having enough to eat.\n\nI THOUGHT MY LOW-FAT DIET WAS GOOD FOR ME. IT WAS THE OPPOSITE Christina Rochdale is a life-long \u2018healthy eater\u2019 \u2013 but her low-fat diet led to worsening health problems after she was injured in a road accident last year. The former casino attendant from Middleton in Greater Manchester, was knocked over by a speeding car. Christina Rochdale (pictured) is a life-long \u2018healthy eater\u2019 \u2013 but her low-fat diet led to worsening health problems Hospitalised for four weeks with a broken leg and bruised ribs \u2013 and not a fan of hospital food \u2013 her weight dropped dramatically. \u2018I looked in the mirror and was shocked. You could see all my ribs,\u2019 says Christina, left, who lives alone. A dietician paid her a visit, warning of the potential consequences of her low weight, such as increased risk of infection and muscle and bone wastage. She was told to choose \u2018full-fat everything\u2019 \u2013 but it felt alien. \u2018I do try to eat cakes and biscuits, but I worry that it\u2019s the wrong type of fat \u2013 maybe it will do more harm than good,\u2019 she says. \u2018I constantly have chest and throat infections or flu, which means I can\u2019t go out of the house. \u2018But I don\u2019t want to be like this. I look in the mirror and I just feel like saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not me.\u201d \u2019\n\nBEING FRAIL ISN\u2019T JUST PART OF GETTING OLD\n\nThe term \u2018little old lady\u2019 has long been used to describe women of a certain age. It\u2019s assumed that as we age, some shrinkage is inevitable. But frailty is not a normal part of ageing.\n\n\u2018It means you\u2019re malnourished,\u2019 explains Professor Jane Murphy, a dietician and nutrition professor at Bournemouth University, who specialises in healthy ageing. \u2018Even disease-related malnutrition is something that can, and should, be prevented.\u2019\n\nAsk most Britons about the most pressing nutritional problems in the UK and they\u2019ll likely point to obesity. Just last week, former Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies suggested banning snacking on public transport might be a good way to tackle Britain\u2019s ballooning weight problem. But eating too little has equally alarming ramifications, for both public health and the NHS bank balance.\n\nAccording to NHS figures, a third of all hospital patients are at risk of or are already malnourished.\n\nThe additional cost to the health service of treating under-nourished patients is estimated at roughly \u00a320 billion a year, triple that of obesity. According to the latest figures, one in ten over-65-year-olds are malnourished \u2013 roughly 1.3 million. They are, for want of a better phrase, at risk of starving to death.\n\nRamifications of malnutrition include bone-wasting diseases such as osteoporosis, kidney disease, hypothermia, potentially lethal infections and heart failure. Then there\u2019s delirium, confusion and hallucinations should patients become both malnourished and dehydrated.\n\n\u2018Malnutrition is a serious slippery slope to severe health problems,\u2019 says Kirstine Farrer, consultant dietician at the Salford Royal Hospital and head of Age UK\u2019s nutrition programme. \u2018It\u2019s behind many of the emergency situations we see. Less cushioning means they could fall over and crack a rib, and they can\u2019t get back up.\n\n\u2018Or their defence system is so poor that they contract a deadly infection, or kidney disease. Then they end up in and out of hospital. But this downward spiral can be prevented with good nutrition.\u2019\n\nEAT A DIET RIGHT FOR THE STAGE OF YOUR LIFE\n\nLeading charities and organisations have joined forces to urge us to take notice of what they are calling a \u2018silent health epidemic\u2019.\n\nThe British Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition and The Malnutrition Taskforce campaign group launch a nationwide crusade tomorrow to educate healthcare professionals, patients and carers about the scale of the problem. A resource pack including tools for identifying malnutrition and tips for weight gain will be sent to thousands of healthcare professionals working with older, at-risk adults \u2013 from care homes to GPs.\n\nAge UK will also be running local events supporting the campaign. At the top of the agenda is challenging some of the Government\u2019s messages about healthy eating.\n\nAccording to Lesley Carter, malnutrition lead at Age UK, billboards telling us to cut down on sugary treats could be unknowingly putting thousands at risk. She says: \u2018Advice to eat low-fat, low-sugar and low-calorie foods isn\u2019t relevant to most of the older population.\n\n\u2018For thousands of people in their 70s, 80s and 90s, the emphasis needs to be on getting more calories in.\u2019\n\nCarter and other campaigners would like to see the Government issue healthy-eating advice on \u2018eating for your stage of life\u2019.\n\nFarrer agrees: \u2018As we get older, increasing calorie intake, specifically from protein and fats, is important.\u2019 Carter adds: \u2018Many older people are of a generation that championed keeping fit and dieting. So switching to full-fat milk, cheese and puddings, and snacking on biscuits to get their weight up, can feel a struggle.\u2019\n\nSurvey data released exclusively to The Mail on Sunday revealed that almost half of the 2,000 Britons polled believe a low-fat, low-calorie diet is always a healthy choice \u2013 even if you\u2019re underweight.\n\nSwitching to full-fat milk, cheese and puddings, and snacking on biscuits to get your weight up, can feel a struggle, Lesley Carter, malnutrition lead at Age UK, explains\n\nMany elderly people shun full-fat milk in favour of 'healthier' alternatives, but they could actually be doing more harm than good\n\nMEALS ON WHEELS LIFELINE IS VANISHING\n\nAnother reason for the rising tide of malnourished older adults is the gradual disappearance of Britain\u2019s Meals on Wheels services over the past decade.\n\nIn 2011, more than two-thirds of local authorities provided the subsidised food delivery service for over-60s unable to shop or cook.\n\nIn 2019, less than half still do so.\n\nIn the past five years, the price of a hot meal has risen by up to 50 per cent \u2013 from \u00a33.62 to \u00a34.30 \u2013 in some areas.\n\n\u2018Losing Meals on Wheels means many older people have lost a lifeline,\u2019 says Prof Murphy. There is also a shortage of care staff, meaning many no longer benefit from regular check-ups or shopping trips.\n\nTraumatic life events often trigger a cycle of under-eating, say the experts. \u2018Bereavement can spark a loss in appetite, especially if someone\u2019s been used to cooking for two people,\u2019 says Farrer.\n\nThe ageing process dampens hunger and thirst signals, so many lack the motivation to eat or drink. \u2018Hard foods can be painful to eat, or get constipated because they of dehydration. This puts them off eating,\u2019 says Farrer.\n\nThe solution lies with prevention. \u2018If we catch people before they become underweight, we stop the cycle of persistent illness and infection. \u2018If you spot some gradual weight loss, try to get them to eat more \u2013 but little and often.\u2019\n\n\u2018Little and often\u2019 is a mantra for 69-year-old Gerry. At 4.30pm, he\u2019s on his third meal of the day \u2013 a tiny corned beef sandwich. He tries to prepare minced beef for his supper at least once a week.\n\n\u2018Now that I\u2019ve got a bit of strength back, I\u2019ve finally regained my appetite,\u2019 he says. On the arm of his chair, buried beneath a pile of papers, I notice a shiny chocolate bar wrapper. \u2018They tell you not to eat sugar,\u2019 he says, picking up the Twix bar. \u2018But a little bit does my body a world of good.\u2019", "description": "Christina Rochdale, from Middleton in Greater Manchester, is a life-long 'healthy eater' - but her low-fat diet led to worsening health problems after she was injured in a road accident last year.", "authors": ["Eve Simmons For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/17/19631350-0-image-a-53_1570899046713.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
