The Rock was ceded to Britain in 1713 but Spain still claims sovereignty over it.\n\nThe territory still remembers how in 1969 Spanish dictator Gen. Francisco Franco slammed shut the border in an attempt to wreck Gibraltar's economy.\n\nThe international operations of Gibraltar-based online gambling companies, meanwhile, need access to the EU market. They account for some 25 percent of Gibraltar's economy, some 40 percent of its corporate tax revenue and about 3,000 jobs.\n\nThe Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party, in an alliance with the Gibraltar Liberal Party, is seeking a third consecutive term in government in Thursday's ballot.\n\nFabian Picardo, the incumbent Chief Minister who heads the government, said in his election manifesto that negotiating within the wider EU-U.K. Brexit talks was the \"hardest thing I have ever done.\"\n\n\"It has literally been my 'Hell on Earth' in politics,\" he wrote.\n\nHis party is proposing a major infrastructure plan, including land reclamation and the construction of affordable housing projects, to help keep the economy ticking over post-Brexit.\n\nThe Gibraltar Social Democrats, the main opposition, are offering tax cuts, a focus on tourism and the building of an industrial park, while reducing debt.\n\nThe recently formed Together Gibraltar promises to crack down on corruption and introduce a fairer tax system.\n\nElection results are expected early Friday.\n\n___\n\nHatton reported from Lisbon, Portugal.", "description": "GIBRALTAR (AP) - An election for Gibraltar's 17-seat parliament took place Thursday under a cloud of uncertainty about what Brexit will bring for the speck...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
