However, The Telegraph reports that Brussels sources are considering several options, including a shorter extension to November 30th. Also being discussed are variations on a \u201cflextension\u201d where the delay would end once the British Parliament ratifies the WAB.\n\nThe EU has said it will not grant extensions without good reason, such as for a second referendum or an election. One source said it is possible to issue one on the grounds of allowing a \u201cnational consensus\u201d on the deal to emerge in parliament.\n\nThe diplomat said: \u201cOf course that is always preferable to the risk of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my prime minister is willing to take the political risk of running into a no-deal Brexit situation,\u201d they added.\n\nBritish MP Lobbies Poland to Defy EU \u2018Mafia Cartel\u2019 and Block Brexit Delay https://t.co/ZcXgNCw6hR \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 23, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Irish Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar spoke to Mr Tusk and confirmed that he would back an extension, according to a statement from the government of the Republic of Ireland. European Union ambassadors will be meeting on Thursday and Friday in Brussels, and if all countries agree, it could be announced early next week.\n\nMPs voted on Tuesday to progress Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill to a second reading. But lawmakers blocked the prime minister\u2019s intensive three-day schedule to ratify it, scuppering plans to take the UK out of the EU by October 31st.\n\nThe Times reports that the prime minister is expected to lobby French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron to resist the full extension and offer a shorter delay to allow enough time to pass the bill through both houses of Parliament.\n\nMr Macron is the most resistant to \u201cnew deadlines\u201d, saying last week: \u201cI think the October 31 date should be respected. We need to end these negotiations and get on negotiating the future relationship.\u201d\n\nDiplomatic sources told The Telegraph on Monday night that Mr Macron will only support a very short extension \u201cof a few days\u201d.\n\nThe EU27 must agree unanimously for a Brexit delay, meaning that if one country rejects the request, the UK will leave the EU as scheduled on Halloween.\n\nBrexiteer Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski has been lobbying Poland to reject pressure from the \u201cmafia cartel\u201d EU and veto the extension. The Polish-born MP said colleagues were also talking to their Hungarian and Czech counterparts to ensure that Brexit is delivered as promised.", "description": "President of the European Council Donald Tusk had told European leaders to grant the UK an extension to Article 50 to stop a no-deal Brexit.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Donald-Tusk-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
