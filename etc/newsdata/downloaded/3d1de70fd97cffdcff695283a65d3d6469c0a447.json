The federal government will have to reschedule flights for those refugees \u2014 who have already passed the lengthy screening process \u2014 once the moratorium is lifted. Travel arrangements for refugees who have already been admitted into the U.S. has been postponed twice before, according to CNN\u2019s report.\n\nThe pause in resettlements may be due to President Trump not having signed off on the refugee ceiling for the new fiscal year started Oct. 1, according to CNN. The Trump administration said in September it plans on setting this fiscal year\u2019s refugee cap at 18,000 \u2014 a 40% reduction from the 2019 cap of fiscal 30,000, which advocates said was already dangerously low. According to federal data analyzed by Pew, refugee admissions for fiscal 2019 did hit the 30,000 cap.\n\nThe steady decrease in refugee admissions has hurt resettlement agencies across the country. World Relief, one of the nine nonprofit groups tasked with resettling refugees, closed one of its offices in Jacksonville, Florida, this year because of last year\u2019s refugee cuts.\n\n\u201cIt's the money,\u201d Elaine Carson, the founding director of World Relief\u2019s Jacksonville program, previously told VICE News. \u201cOur funding was per refugee. So for every refugee we got, the more money we had to be able to have staff and be here. But we don't have the money anymore.\u201d\n\nThe cuts \u2014 not to mention the series of delays in letting already admitted refugees into the U.S. \u2014 have created a new series of problems. Bethany Christian Services, an organization that partners with refugee resettlement agencies and finds foster homes for unaccompanied minors, has had four teenage refugees age out of its services, CNN reports. The four minors all turned 18 while waiting to be let into the U.S., meaning they no longer qualify for foster care and have to wait to be allowed in to the U.S. as adults.\n\nCover: In this June 20, 2017 file photo, refugees and community activists gather in front of the White House in Washington.
