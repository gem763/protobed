He was the main leg-spinner in that era.\n\n\u201cHe was a terrific bowler who bamboozled a lot of batsmen. His record is a terrific one.\u201d\n\nRenowned for his fairly long run-up and a unique bowling action, Qadir was almost unplayable on pitches in Pakistan and one of the favourites of former captain Imran Khan \u2014 now the country\u2019s Prime Minister.\n\nQadir reserved his finest performances for England and his spell of 9-56 in Lahore in 1987 is still the best by a Pakistan bowler in a test innings.\n\n\u201cHe would always ask you whether you had picked the googly,\u201d former England captain David Gower told Sky Sports. \u201c\u2018Have you picked it?\u2019 he would tease. A lovely guy, with a huge skillset. Our condolences to all close to him.\u201d\n\nAfter retiring from the sport, he served as the chief selector for Pakistan.\n\n\"They called him the magician for many reasons but when he looked me in the eyes & told me I was going to play for Pakistan for the next 20 years, I believed him,\" former Pakistan bowler Wasim Akram wrote on Twitter here\n\n\u201cA Magician, absolutely. A leg spinner & a trailblazer of his time.\u201d", "description": "Pakistan cricket great Abdul Qadir, who revived the art of leg-spin bowling, has died at the age of 63, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
