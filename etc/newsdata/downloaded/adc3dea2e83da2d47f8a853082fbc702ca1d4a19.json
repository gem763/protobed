Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nHow much?!\n\nEstate agent comparison website, GetAgent.co.uk, calculates that some sellers are paying a huge proportions of their assets in estate agents fees to sell their home in a stuttering market. And they\u2019re not necessarily where you\u2019d expect.\n\nIn cash terms, of course London is going to be eye-watering. The SW7 post code in southwest London is home to the highest with the average commission of 1.9 per cent equating to a fee of \u00a336,540 on the average house price. In fact, the top 10 post codes by amount are all in Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster.\n\nOutside of London, KT11 in Elmbridge is home to the highest fee paid by UK home sellers, with a 1.6 per cent commission equating to \u00a314,921. GU25 in Runnymede is the second highest at \u00a313,408. Even SG10 in east Hertfordshire, SO42 in the New Forest and HP8 in south Buckinghamshire all come in above \u00a39,000.\n\nThese prices all reflect the cost of the property itself.\n\nBut when it comes to the size of the cut, estate agents in East Ayrshire are taking the most, at an average of almost 3 per cent of the sale price. Properties there may average just under \u00a390,000 each but their former owners are regularly handing over more than \u00a32,640 of it.\n\nEven agents in Thanet, Liverpool and northeast Lincolnshire charge a greater percentage than those in parts of Kensington and Chelsea.\n\nAt the other end of the scale agents in PH7 in Perth and Kinross, IV19 in Highland, PA20 in Argyll and Bute and KA2 in east Ayrshire will charge you only 0.6 per cent of the property value to sell it for you.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder agents\u2019 costs are met with confusion and consternation. Especially from those with buying costs to then consider on top.\n\nSo how can you get your home sold for the right price at the right time for the right fee?\n\nThe good news is that these days there are choices to fit every pocket. The bad news is that this doesn\u2019t make the matter any simpler.\n\nSelling privately\n\nIn the world of property, as in so much of life, you get what you pay for.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt a traditional high street estate agent works for their commission \u2013 from valuation visits and arranging legal requirements, to vetting potential buyers and physically walking interested parties around the home. It\u2019s certainly a solution for those with assets but no time to spare.\n\nBut for the rest of us, the cost involved, the time invested in getting it done and how quickly you need a sale need careful weighing up.\n\nFor starters, don\u2019t go anywhere near a quick home buyer or one whose adverts guarantee to buy your property unless you are really desperate and have exhausted all other avenues to liquidate your cash. From last minute cuts to the offer to problems even identifying the buyer and whether they\u2019re good for the money, these companies have been in the sights of the regulators for years.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s no doubt that selling privately is the cheapest way of selling a home. Aside from the cost of legal obligations and any tax bills, you\u2019ll keep the full amount you sell for yourself, but this is a time-consuming option.\n\nExtensive research will be critical before you even begin marketing your home to ensure you don\u2019t fall foul of everything from the law to a bad valuation. Citizens Advice provides an impartial checklist for private sellers.\n\nAnd somehow, though we Brits baulk at the fees charged by some old-school agents, we\u2019re not quite ready to go it alone either.\n\nPared back service\n\nOnline estate agents are cheaper than traditional agents with a physical high street presence because they\u2019re operated from call centres and websites. If you sign up for a basic package, you\u2019ll be doing all the running around albeit within a clear framework. At least one of the biggest online agents won\u2019t even supply a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign without charging extra.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that in itself, especially if you\u2019re aware of what you\u2019re getting into and are happy taking marketing photos of your home, conducting viewings and the like. It could also save you a packet.\n\nConsumer group Which? estimates that, nationwide, using a traditional agent to sell a \u00a3250,000 property would typically cost around 1.3 per cent in commission, or \u00a33,250. Use an online agent and the figure could be as little as \u00a3300 to \u00a31500 regardless of the property\u2019s value. You may well have to pay up front though, and London sellers will by charged at the top end of that range.\n\nWhich? also found that, on average, online agents sold properties 38 days faster than traditional agents.\n\nBut what if you\u2019re painfully shy and wouldn\u2019t know where to start vetting potential buyers but still don\u2019t think you need 24/7 hand holding?\n\nEnter the hybrid deal. Increasingly popular, this bumped up service provided by online agents is a halfway house between the most stripped back of their services and the full-blown arrangements offered by high street agents.\n\nInstead of basing the value of your property on online data, a real-life person will conduct a real valuation, for example. And though they may not have the in-depth local knowledge of a traditional agent, online agents aren\u2019t known for inflated prices.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth knowing that all estate agents, online or traditional must comply with the Property Ombudsman or Property Redress scheme (they have to tell you which) and abide by the 1979 Estate Agent Act enforced by Trading Standards.", "description": "With selling season in full swing, at least minus the Brexit effect, sellers up and down the country are inhaling sharply at the cost of parting with their last property.
