Delta charges $30 each way for a checked bag on a domestic flight. For a family of four taking a long vacation, just having the credit card can help save $240 \u2014 $30 each bag, each way would mean a total of $240 for the whole family.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which will far outweigh the value of any points or miles. It's important to practice financial discipline when using credit cards by paying your balances in full each month, making payments on time, and only spending what you can afford to pay back.\n\nUsing the benefit is easy\n\nWhen you apply for a Delta Amex card, you're prompted to enter your Delta SkyMiles number. From that point on, as long as the card is open, the benefits are tied to your SkyMiles account.\n\nJust make sure that you're logged in to your Delta account when booking tickets \u2014 or, if you're booking through a third-party portal like Expedia, just enter your Delta number during the booking process. If you go to add a bag when checking in for your flight, you'll see a cost of $0.00. The same will apply for anyone else on the same reservation with you.\n\nThe key is making sure that you're on the same reservation. If you book separately, your travel companions won't have access to free checked bags unless they have their own Delta credit card (or hold elite Medallion status).\n\nDelta SkyMiles credit cards\n\nIf you're thinking about getting a Delta credit card, now is the perfect time. Three of the cards are offering limited-time welcome bonuses that can get you up to 75,000 bonus miles \u2014 but only until October 30.\n\nThe Gold Delta SkyMiles card offers 60,000 Delta SkyMiles when you spend $2,000 in the first three months. You can also get a $50 statement credit after you make a Delta purchase with your card in the first three months.\n\nThe Platinum version is offering 75,000 SkyMiles and 5,000 MQMs when you spend $3,000 in the first three months. You can also earn a $100 statement credit after you make a Delta purchase with your card in the first three months.\n\nDelta's premium card, the Delta Reserve, offers 75,000 miles and 10,000 Medallion Qualification Miles after you spend $5,000 in three months.\n\nDelta and Amex recently announced some significant changes to their lineup of cards, including additional bonus categories for earning miles and new benefits. The annual fees of these three cards will all go up and the new perks will take effect on January 30, 2020.\n\nDon't forget that these welcome bonuses are only available until October 30, so don't wait.", "description": "If you have a Delta credit card, you can get a free checked bag.
