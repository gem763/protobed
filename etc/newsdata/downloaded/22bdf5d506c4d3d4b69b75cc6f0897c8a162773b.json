But he said he wouldn\u2019t cast his world view \u201cas some reaction to that.\u201d\n\nIn March, James Murdoch exited his role as CEO of 21st Century Fox when Disney did a $71.3 billion buyout of its film and TV assets. Brother Lachlan Murdoch was selected by their father to helm what remained of the new Fox Corporation, leaving James Murdoch on the outside.\n\nUnlike his younger brother, Lachlan Murdoch has defended Fox News, whose primetime hosts often praise President Donald Trump with propagandistic coverage while occasionally spewing white nationalist rhetoric.\n\nAsked during last year\u2019s New York Times DealBook conference whether he was embarrassed by the network\u2019s style, Lachlan Murdoch argued that it filled a void in American media.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not embarrassed by what they do at all,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to understand that Fox News is the only mass media company in America, in this country, with conservative opinion, with strong conservative opinion in prime time.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, James Murdoch\u2019s differences with his family have become increasingly evident, most recently in his donations to Democratic presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg and John Hickenlooper (who has since dropped out of the race).\n\nHe continues to lead Quadrivium, a foundation he and wife Kathryn Murdoch founded in 2014, which is taking on a range of initiatives addressing climate change, ocean health and U.S. democratic principles.\n\nMurdoch has also been named a board member of the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank that is collaborating with his foundation on a project called \u201cCountering High-Tech Illiberalism.\u201d According to the center\u2019s website, the initiative will explore how digital technologies are \u201cused to polarize and pervert the politics of democratic societies\u201d and seek to \u201cdevelop the policy and technology innovations necessary to secure a freer and more open future.\u201d", "description": "The son of conservative media titan Rupert Murdoch is worried about growing threats to democratic principles.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8006773b0000c49fd4b500.jpeg?cache=zivvvt9wof&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
