That\u2019s a trick question. They often are not. How would they acquire such skills?\n\nPeople who go into business learn to negotiate proficiently. Or they don\u2019t, in which case they\u2019re soon asking: \u201cYou want fries with that?\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re not a businessperson, perhaps you\u2019ve bargained over a house or haggled with an employer over your salary. When you work for the government abroad such issues are mostly settled for you.\n\nSometimes, too, diplomats\u2019 bosses let them know that it\u2019s OK to cut a bad deal so long as it can be spun as a good deal.\n\nThe most obvious and egregious example: The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that the Obama administration concluded with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The JCPOA provided the world\u2019s leading state sponsors of terrorism with hundreds of billions of dollars in exchange for a promise to slow-walk \u2014 not terminate \u2014 their nuclear weapons program.\n\nThat deal was modeled on the 1994 Agreed Framework under which President Clinton gave North Korea massive aid in exchange for a promise to cease \u2014 not just delay \u2014 its nuclear weapons program. The regime took the money and ran a nuclear weapons program anyway.\n\nAlso the result of American diplomatic incompetence: The 2013 Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons. That deal was intended to ensure that dictator Bashar Assad surrendered his chemical weapons stockpiles and never again used such weapons against his own people.\n\nTwo years later, Ambassador Samantha Power gave the commencement address at the University of Pennsylvania. I happened to be in the audience because my daughter was among the graduates.\n\nMs. Power described the pivotal role she had played in those talks. Though the challenge seemed daunting, she said, President Obama had faith in her, and she told him: \u201cI\u2019ve got this!\u201d\n\nThe Class of 2015 cheered, oblivious to the fact that Mr. Assad retained and continued to use his chemical weapons, as well as other heinous and outlawed weapons. Had my wife not restrained me, I might have stormed the stage and grabbed the microphone from her hand.\n\nMs. Power has just published a memoir, \u201cThe Education of an Idealist,\u201d in which she is more candid, acknowledging that, due to President Obama\u2019s policies, \u201cAssad could reasonably conclude that, going forward, he could starve his people into submission, carpet bomb hospitals and schools, and eventually even resume chemical weapons attacks, all without the United States doing much to stop him.\u201d\n\nWhich brings me to this: Donald Trump entered the White House as \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d grandmaster. That he could put such skills to good use in diplomatic palavers seemed plausible.\n\nSo far, however, he has not been able to strike a bargain with any of America\u2019s adversaries.\n\nAt least part of the explanation: In the business world even the toughest and meanest competitors want to end up with a deal \u2014 a good deal, not a bad deal, to be sure, but they don\u2019t rule out compromise, giving for getting, \u201cwin-win\u201d outcomes.\n\nThe same is rarely true of despotic ideologues. They tend to be zero-sum kind of guys, for whom turning a profit is not the only or even primary objective.\n\nAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, first \u201csupreme leader\u201d of the Islamic Republic of Iran, was certainly no material girl. He famously said that the revolution he sparked in 1979 was \u201cnot about the price of watermelons.\u201d\n\nThough his heirs have made themselves filthy rich, they don\u2019t give a fig about their increasingly impoverished subjects. Spending money on terrorists is a priority. Creating the best darned health care system in the Middle East \u2014 not so much.\n\nSimilarly, I doubt Kim Jong-un has been tempted by President Trump\u2019s repeated offers to help North Korea \u201cenjoy prosperity like he has never seen.\u201d\n\nA year ago, Mr. Trump showed the young dictator a 4-minute video that included images of American missiles and fighter jets producing \u201cfire and fury.\u201d The president seemed to be making Mr. Kim \u201can offer he can\u2019t refuse\u201d (in the immortal words of Vito Corleone). At this point, I suspect Mr. Kim figures it was just a bluff.\n\nHistorically, conflicts often dragged on until it was clear who was victor and who vanquished; who had triumphed and who had suffered defeat. Neither side found ambiguity an appealing option.\n\nAs recently as World War II, Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt held fast against those who argued for a \u201cdiplomatic solution\u201d with Nazi Germany. They insisted instead on \u201cunconditional surrender.\u201d And President Reagan, asked about his strategy for the Cold War, famously said: \u201cWe win, they lose.\u201d\n\nToday, many Americans and Europeans have come to believe that the distinction between winning and losing should be hazy; that maybe we\u2019re not so good and our enemies not so bad, so perhaps detente is a good-enough goal; that at game\u2019s end, all the children should take home a trophy.\n\nIt certainly would be nice if we could convince Ali Khamenei, Kim Jong-un, the Taliban, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping to join what we like to call the \u201cliberal, rules-based order;\u201d to embrace Enlightenment values; to prefer commerce over conquest; to cultivate productive interdependence within an \u201cinternational community.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t we help them see what we see \u2014 that in the 21st century, peace and prosperity are the only sensible objectives?\n\nAs they say in Mr. Trump\u2019s hometown: Fahgettaboudit! And until Western negotiators \u2014 whether diplomats or tycoons \u2014 come to terms with this stark reality and adjust their policies and negotiating strategies accordingly, the chances of achieving good deals are slim to none.\n\n\u2022 Clifford D.
