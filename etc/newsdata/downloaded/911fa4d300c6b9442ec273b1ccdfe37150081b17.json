REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nChinese policymakers have been trying to boost bank lending and lower corporate financing costs, especially for the small and private companies vital for growth and jobs, but they have also cautioned against aggressive stimulus amid worries over debt risks.\n\nSeparate data on Tuesday showed China\u2019s factory-gate prices fell at their fastest pace in more than three years in September, adding to a slew of data in recent months that underline increasing pressure on the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.\n\nConsumer inflation accelerated to 3% in September \u2014 the highest since October 2013 \u2014 but analysts attributed this to the supply-side impact of rising food costs, driven by surging pork prices as African swine fever diminishes hog supplies.\n\nChinese banks extended 1.69 trillion yuan ($238.98 billion)in new loans in September, up from August and exceeding analyst expectations, data released by the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) showed on Tuesday.\n\nAnalysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would rise to 1.4 trillion yuan in September, up from 1.21 trillion yuan in August but largely in line with the tally in September last year.\n\nBanks have boosted lending for the real economy, underscored by a pick-up in medium- and long-term corporate loans, Ruan Jianhong, head of statistics at the PBOC, told reporters. She added that property loans have been slowing.\n\nCorporate loans jumped to 1.01 trillion yuan in September from 651.3 billion yuan in August. Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 755 billion yuan last month from 653.8 billion yuan in August, central bank data showed.\n\nSun Guofeng, head of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy department, told the same briefing that the PBOC will rely on reforms to improve policy-transmission mechanisms and help lower borrowing costs.\n\nSun also said the central bank should manage inflation expectations, although there is no basis for continued inflation and deflation.\n\nBroad M2 money supply in September grew 8.4% from a year earlier, above the 8.2% forecast in the Reuters poll, which was unchanged from August.\n\nOutstanding yuan loans grew 12.5% from a year earlier, quicker than August\u2019s 12.4%. Analysts had expected a 12.3% growth.\n\nMORE EASING SEEN NEEDED\n\nAnalysts expect the central bank to ease policy further to support growth, despite some signs of easing in trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the two sides had reached agreement on the first phase of a deal and suspended a tariff increase, but officials said much work still needed to be done.\n\n\u201cThe upshot is that policy easing is still failing to meaningfully lift credit growth. We think this will ultimately push the PBOC to cut the rates on its lending facilities more decisively,\u201d Martin Lynge Rasmussen, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients after the data release.\n\nChina\u2019s economic growth in the third quarter is expected to slow to 6.1% year-on-year, just below the 6.2% pace in the second quarter, according to a Reuters poll.\n\nAnalysts in the latest Reuters poll expect the PBOC will ease policy further by cutting banks\u2019 reserve retirement ratios (RRR) and the one-year loan prime rate (LPR), its new benchmark lending rate.\n\nThe PBOC has already cut RRR seven times since early 2018, in addition to two modest reductions in the one-year LPR since August.\n\nCentral bank Governor Yi Gang said late in September large interest rate cuts were not urgently needed, following Beijing\u2019s reiteration that it would not use \u201cflood-like\u201d stimulus measures.\n\nBOND DEFAULTS RISING\n\nDespite prodding from Beijing, several bankers have told Reuters they have little appetite for lending to smaller companies because of the uncertain economic outlook, the trade war and a years-long drive to purge risks from the financial system. Some companies also say banks are sharply reducing credit lines.\n\nCorporate bond defaults, meanwhile, look set for another record year, though most have been by smaller, private firms.\n\nGrowth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, rose 10.8% in September from a year earlier.\n\nThe central bank has revised TSF growth in August to 10.8% from 10.7% after a change in the way it calculates TSF.\n\nTSF includes off-balance-sheet forms of financing from outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.\n\nIn September, TSF rose to 2.27 trillion yuan, according to PBOC. It also revised up August\u2019 s figure to 2.02 trillion yuan from 1.98 trillion yuan.\n\nMany analysts believe high debt levels \u2014 a legacy of massive stimulus sprees in the past \u2014 are making policymakers more cautious in their stimulus and more tolerant of slower growth as long as it is gradual.", "description": "China's banks extended more new yuan loans than expected in September, as policymakers ramped up support to stabilize the slowing economy during a bruising trade war with the United States.", "authors": ["Lusha Zhang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441101886&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E10R", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
