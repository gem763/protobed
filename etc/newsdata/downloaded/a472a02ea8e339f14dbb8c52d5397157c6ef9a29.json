But what is different this time now, the fact that you're saying it's progressing?\"\n\n\"I think they want to make a deal; they're losing their supply chain.\" President Trump\n\nBut Partsinevelos jumped in again, asking if the president had something specific.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Well, I don't want to say that,\" Trump responded. \"They want to make a deal.

And that's not good. That's far worse than they thought. And by the way, in the meantime, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs. We\u2019re taking in tremendous numbers in tariffs, and we're helping our farmers who got targeted now.\"\n\nPartsinevelos went on to ask for greater details into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, commonly called NAFTA.\n\nHer hard-hitting questions received accolades on social media.\n\nPartsinevelos admitted there was a method to ensure the president called on her, especially when he only pointed to a handful of reporters.\n\n\"It really helped to be seated in the front row because I was right in the line of sight of the president,\" Partsinevelos told FOX Business after the press conference concluded.\n\n\"I opted to wait out the first round of questions and not raise my hand.
