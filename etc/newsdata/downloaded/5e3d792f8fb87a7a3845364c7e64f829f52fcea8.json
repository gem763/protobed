Well chilled, however, it\u2019s surprisingly refreshing stuff, and refreshingly thrifty as well \u2013 the perfect home for that stale loaf and those over-ripe berries going cheap at the market.\n\nPrep 15 min\n\nChill 4 hr-plus\n\nServes 6\n\nButter, to grease\n\nHalf a loaf of slightly stale, good-quality white bread\n\n225g redcurrants\n\n675g raspberries\n\n2\u20133 tbsp caster sugar\n\n1 Pick the right bread\n\nIf your bread is obstinately fresh, very lightly toast it before use, or it may disintegrate under the weight of the fruit juices. There are advocates for cheap white sliced here, but, like brioche, I find it too soft and squidgy for the purpose. Decent white bread is the way to go, but do try to get it machine-sliced, if possible, because it will make for a neater finish.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pick a slightly stale, but good-quality sliced white loaf, then cut off and discard all the crusts.\n\n2 Prepare the bread and basin\n\nIf you can\u2019t get machine-sliced, cut the loaf into medium slices, then cut off the crusts and set aside to make breadcrumbs (or feed them to the dog). With a little butter, grease a pudding basin or a deep bowl with a capacity of about a litre (measure this by filling it with water, then tipping it into a measuring jug).\n\n3 Line the basin with bread\n\nLine the inside of the basin all over with a single layer of bread, cutting it as necessary to make a base and fitting it around the sides without any gaps. Finally, make a lid in the same way, but leave this off for the time being. Set the basin aside while you prepare the filling.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Use the slices of bread to line the inside of a greased pudding bowl, saving a slice to act as a lid.\n\n4 Start on the filling\n\nAfter removing any stalks, put the fruit (sweet raspberries and sharp redcurrants are the classic combo here, but they\u2019re not the only choice \u2013 see step 9) in a small pan with the sugar and bring to a very gentle simmer over a medium-low heat \u2013 give it a bit of a stir now and then, to help dissolve the sugar, but try to keep the berries intact.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Select the fruit \u2013 raspberries and redcurrants work well \u2013 put in a pan with sugar, and simmer to dissolve.\n\n5 Add the fruit to the basin\n\nTaste and add more sugar, or a squeeze of lemon juice or wine vinegar, if you think it necessary (remember, the bread is fairly bland, so you can get away with strong flavours here). Then, gently spoon the fruit into the bread-lined basin and pour over most of the syrup, reserving any excess fruit or juices for serving.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest When the liquid is syrupy, gently transfer the fruit to the bread-lined bowl and pour over most of the syrup.\n\n6 Cover and leave to soak\n\nPut the bread lid on top of the fruit filling, then put a plate on top of that and weigh it down with some tins or something else heavy. Once it feels cool to the touch, transfer to the fridge, still weighted down, and chill for at least four hours, and ideally overnight, to give the fruit and bread a chance to mingle.\n\n7 Flip and unmould\n\nRemove the weight and plate, and put a large serving plate (one with a pronounced lip is advisable, to keep all the juices in check) over the top. Very carefully turn over the basin, give it a sharp tap on the base and around the sides, then lift off to reveal the pudding.\n\n8 Finishing touches\n\nPour the reserved syrup over the top of the pudding (this is particularly useful for covering any pale patches where the juices haven\u2019t quite soaked in evenly) and arrange any leftover fruit artistically on top; a few mint leaves also look nice, if you have some to hand. Serve at once with a generous jug of cool double cream.\n\n9 Variations on the theme\n\nSummer pudding can be made with a variety of fruit, including blackcurrants and blackberries, and even defrosted frozen fruit, though that will tend to break down into a coulis on heating, so fresh is preferable. I also like to add a dash of rosewater to the fruit, but you could substitute liqueur (sloe gin, for example), orange zest or vanilla sugar.", "description": "Snap up bargain berries and snaffle the last of the crop from the hedgerows and make this seasonal filling, fruity classic", "authors": ["Felicity Cloake"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a706bd8f15a879f8bb66efc57050d8ba95ad712b/0_1171_6712_4028/master/6712.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae7879e4ba9c7898191fe3c136330273", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
