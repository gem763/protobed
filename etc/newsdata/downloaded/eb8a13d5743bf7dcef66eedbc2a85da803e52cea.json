Twitter/@SteveBakerHW\n\nThe UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) confirmed the news and published a note saying that Glint's users' deposits aren't protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). Customers were still receiving their Glint cards and were able to deposit money into Glint on Friday, despite the company reportedly already filing for administration on Wednesday last week. The reason for Glint entering administration remains undisclosed as of now.\n\nGlint's failure may have to do with the fintech taking on too much too soon during a turbulent time:\n\nGlint Cofounder and COO Ben Davies left the company in January, while three members of its 11-person management team were on garden leave, per AltFi. In late November 2018, Mark Mahaffey and Davies stepped down from the Glint board of directors but remained employees. It's likely that these departures came amid early struggles at the company. Moreover, having an unstable management team can make scaling more difficult and lead to more hurdles along the way.\n\nDespite an uprooted team, Glint decided to bring its product to more markets. Although it was delayed by six months, Glint expanded to the US in July. The firm secured a $5 million funding round led by Sequoia last month, which was likely used to fuel its expansion. It seems likely that the company faced some cash flow struggles along the way: It has relatively little capital compared with other fintechs expanding from the UK to the US, like Monzo, a fintech unicorn that's received over \u00a3324 million ($403 million) in funding since launching in 2015.\n\nWe've seen other fintechs struggle throughout 2019 \u2014 a trend we'll probably see intensify in the future. Fintechs including neobank Loot, marketplace lender Lendy, and Ipagoo, which offered multicurrency accounts with an accompanying debit card, have all entered administration this year.\n\nAs the fintech space matures and players in the industry are able to establish themselves by attracting relatively large customer bases \u2014 UK-based neobank Revolut, for example, boasts 7 million users \u2014 it will become increasingly difficult for smaller players to differentiate while still offering good value propositions. Glint's product, while different, may have been too niche to attract a sustainable customer base. In the future, we'll likely see more smaller fintech players fold.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
