On Monday in New York, Britain, France and Germany sided with the U.S. and named Iran as perpetrators of the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Aramco oil facility. \u201cIt is clear for us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other explanation,\u201d said the official statement from French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nThat\u2019s huge, and Merkel also told Iran\u2019s President Rouhani flat out that sanctions would not be lifted.\n\nRemember, the Iran deal was very much a UN creature: it\u2019s the other UN Security Council Permanent members (Britain, France, China, Russia) plus Germany, and the EU, in the JCPOA.\n\nEven more significant, Britain, France and Germany (the E3) now demand strict new terms, quite similar to Trump\u2019s. \u201cThe time has come for Iran to accept a long-term negotiation framework for its nuclear program, as well as regional security issues, which include its missile programs,\" their statement declared.\n\n\u201cE3 paralysis,\u201d ranted sanctioned Iranian foreign minister and Twitter fan Javid Zarif. Nope. It\u2019s a clear win for Trump as Iran failed to split the US and its allies despite the nuclear blackmail and military provocations this summer.\n\nFour Nations Ink Deals to Cut Down the Migrant Caravans. Back in the Western Hemisphere, the White House sewed up a big win on immigration policy on Thursday when Honduras became the third and final \u201cNorthern Triangle\u201d nation to sign a bilateral \u201csafe country\u201d agreement. It\u2019s bigger, in fact, than anything President George W. Bush or Obama accomplished. Trump now has agreements with Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. Talks with Mexico and Panama are underway. Bush 43 signed just one such agreement, with Canada, while the Obama administration signed none.\n\nThe bilateral agreements follow Geneva protocols on refugees. The procedure channels asylum seekers to apply for asylum in the first safe country they reach, not just breeze through and head for the US. The European Union inked a similar agreement with Turkey in 2016 on account of the Syria crisis.\n\nFor Americans, the three agreements complete a crucial triangle covering sites where migrant caravans formed. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said he hopes the policy will discourage people from attempting a \u201cdangerous and often futile journey\u201d to the US border.\n\nThe new policies should also help put coyotes and smugglers out of business and curtail asylum fraud, while streamlining the visa process for agricultural workers, Trump said at the Guatemala signing in July.\n\nChanneling Eleanor Roosevelt, Trump Upholds Global Religious Freedom in UN Session. Ironically, this one got some coverage, much of it condescending.\n\nHere\u2019s the story. At the U.N. General Assembly, President Trump attended a meeting on protecting religious freedom. \u201cWe ask the governments of the world to honor the eternal right of every person to follow their conscience, live by their faith and give glory to God,\u201d Trump said in his remarks.\n\nCue the media disdain.\n\n\u201cTrump skipped the bulk of the summit on climate change to deliver remarks on religious freedom,\u201d snarked The Los Angeles Times. That paper, and other articles, portrayed Trump\u2019s remarks on religious freedom as campaign rhetoric designed to play to voters. TIME likewise dinged him for focusing on religious freedom, not climate.\n\nSad, because the fundamental freedom of religion is enshrined in the UN Charter. The \u201cfreedom of every person to worship God in his own way, everywhere in the world\u201d was how President Franklin Delano Roosevelt phrased it in his 1941 message to Congress. After Roosevelt\u2019s death in 1945, his wife Eleanor Roosevelt carried the freedom of religion theme through her work during the formation of the UN despite massive resistance from the atheist Soviet Union.\n\nYet when Trump talks about religion at the UN, its viewed cynically. And Trump has backed up his UN speech with 5,000 refugee slots specifically for people fleeing religious persecution.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSeparately, Secretary Pompeo picked up the theme, addressing the UN\u2019s concern about China\u2019s internment of 1 million Uighurs and \u201cChina\u2019s attempt to erase its own citizens\u2019 Muslim faith and culture,\u201d in Pompeo\u2019s words.\n\nUnity on Iran, new agreements on immigration, and championing religious freedom are all products of patient, painstaking work. Beyond those issues, Trump also met with leaders from New Zealand, Australia, Poland, and Pakistan, to name a few. The US has urgent military and security cooperation issues ongoing with all four.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd finally, Icy Stares Chill Working Lunch by World\u2019s Top Security Leaders. Not to say it\u2019s all been easy. Far from it. The group photo of the UN Security Council Permanent Members meeting attended by Pompeo and new UN Ambassador Kelly Craft on Thursday looked chilly indeed. No wonder, as Russia and China are working hard to set up an alternative global order, the kind that could make a mockery of the UN.\n\nFor this week at least, Team Trump should get more credit \u2013 or at least more coverage \u2013 when their foreign policy work delivers results.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REBECCA GRANT", "description": "There's been virtually no coverage of a week of solid wins for Trump\u2019s foreign policy team on Iran, immigration and religious freedoms.\u00a0Here are the headlines you should have seen.", "authors": ["Rebecca Grant", "Rebecca Grant Is A National Security Analyst Based In Washington", "D.C.", "She Earned Her Ph.D. In International Relations The London School Of Economics At Age Then Worked For Rand", "On The Staff Of The Secretary Of The Air Force", "Chief Of Staff Of The Air Force.
