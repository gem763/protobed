Elizabeth Warren that had many attendees talking.\n\nThe Democratic presidential hopeful didn\u2019t appear in person at the annual event, billed as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest\u201d drag convention and held at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan. She did, however, record a video message in which she pledged her commitment to LGBTQ equality if elected to the White House in 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in this fight for an America that works for everyone, not just for a thinner and thinner slice at the top,\u201d the Massachusetts senator said in the video, which can be viewed above. \u201cI\u2019m in this fight for full LGBTQ+ equality. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do to make sure that everyone is free to be who they are and to love who they love.\u201d\n\nWarren also pointed to the ongoing epidemic of violence against transgender people, particularly women of color, across the U.S.\n\nMore than two dozen transgender people were killed last year, according to data gathered by CNN, the New York City Anti-Violence Project and the Human Rights Campaign. Last week, Bee Love Slater of Florida became the 18th known transgender person murdered in 2019 thus far.\n\n\u201cWe need to call it out, and we need to fight back,\u201d Warren said. \u201cEveryone should be able to go to school, to work, to get health care or just walk down the street without fear of discrimination or violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cEqual means equal, period. That\u2019s what I\u2019m fighting for,\u201d she added.\n\nGreetings from #DragCon2019! #TeamWarren is in NYC this weekend dreaming big and werking hard. pic.twitter.com/9Sg7L2CrGw \u2014 Team Warren (@TeamWarren) September 8, 2019\n\nDragCon attendees could also pick up Warren placards, stickers and other campaign memorabilia at a small booth set up at the convention center. Not surprisingly, a life-size cutout of the candidate \u2015 appropriately draped with a rainbow boa \u2015 was a big hit among many of the more than 40,000 visitors in attendance.\n\n\u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d veteran Shea Coule\u00e9 said all of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates \u2015 including Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, who is gay \u2015 had been invited to the three-day event.\n\n\u201c[Warren] is the only one that accepted the invitation,\u201d Coule\u00e9 told NBC News. \u201cFor me, that speaks volumes. She\u2019s shown herself to be a great ally.\u201d\n\nSlay @ewarren is only candidate to have a presence at @RuPaulsDragCon - that\u2019s fierce https://t.co/b7VH6pqovs \u2014 Marti Gould Cummings (@MartiGCummings) September 8, 2019\n\n\u201cWe had so many conversations with so many young people and voters,\u201d Coule\u00e9 added. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we get these young voters fired up and excited about the next presidential election.\u201d\n\nAs a senator, Warren has been described as \u201ca persistent champion\u201d for the LGBTQ community. In June, she sponsored a bill to effectively unlock tax refunds previously denied to same-sex couples legally married in some states before a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act was ruled unconstitutional in 2013.\n\nIn July, Warren updated her Twitter bio to note her own preferred pronouns, \u201cshe/hers\u201d \u2015 a gesture that shows solidarity with transgender and nonbinary voters whose pronoun preferences are too often ignored by others.", "description": "The 2020 presidential candidate's virtual \"appearance\" also drew attention to violence against transgender people.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d76b73e3b0000a09bd0c3e5.jpeg?cache=oh7vlt9sqi&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
