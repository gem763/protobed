Two years ago eight on the 12 were fresh blood, including five of six in the NFC.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat is to say the NFL is unpredictable, and delights in smearing our faces with egg. Everything we think we know about these teams will be blown apart within the next few weeks - hell, maybe even days.\n\nWith that in mind here's how I think the turnover will look in 2019. I've gone for a fairly conservative five swaps, but they may not be the ones you'd expect...\n\nAFC - in\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n\nJuJu Smith-Schuster is the new No 1 receiver in Pittsburgh Credit: AP\n\nThe Cleveland Browns may be the hot new toy in the AFC North, but make no mistake, the Steelers are not ready to give up their status as an AFC superpower just yet, and I fully expect them to bounce back from the disappointment of missing the post-season last year not only by righting that wrong, but by winning the division.\n\nFree from the drama of Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell, Pittsburgh have flown under the radar this off-season, and I bet their fans are secretly delighted about it. When you look at this roster they still have one of the league's top quarterbacks in Ben Roethlisberger, an elite offensive line, dangerous weapons like JuJu Smith-Schuster and James Conner and a top-10 calibre defense. Write off the Steelers at your peril. No really - if you write them off Maurkice Pouncey will come to your house and beat you up.\n\nCleveland Browns\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. is Cleveland's new superstar Credit: AP\n\nStory continues\n\nNo team goes into this season with more pressure or expectation on their shoulders than the Cleveland Browns, and that's a lot for first-year head coach Freddie Kitchens to bear. Kitchens only got his first taste of life as a coordinator in relief of the fired Todd Haley last season, but in that short time he developed an excellent understanding with star quarterback Baker Mayfield, and that's why he's been given control of the whole restaurant (geddit?!) for perhaps the most eagerly anticipated campaign for any NFL team in the last decade.\n\nThe weight of expectation is might be the only thing that can bring this team down. The talent is all there. Mayfield is the exact injection of confidence and self-belief this franchise has been crying out for ever since it rose from the ashes in the mid-Nineties, and his supporting cast ain't shabby either. Odell Beckham Jr., brought to Cleveland in that earthquake of a trade in March, has the terrifying potential to go up another level with Mayfield under centre, and the defense, led by former No 1 overall pick Myles Garrett, has all the pieces required to wreck house up front.\n\nIf the Browns have any undoing on the field it's the offensive line, which looks to be the clear weak spot on paper. Even so, anything less than 10 wins - and a playoff berth - would feel like a mighty disappointment.\n\nDenver Broncos\n\nVic Fangio joined the Broncos from the Bears in the off-season Credit: AP\n\nDoesn't Vic Fangio just have all the makings of a Coach of the Year type figure in Denver? Fangio, who built the Bears' defence into the wrecking ball it is today, inherits a unit that boasts Von Miller and Bradley Chubb up front, and a very strong secondary to boot. It's a defense that will put the Broncos into positions to win games, the question is whether the offense is up to that task.\n\nJoe Flacco should be an improvement on Case Keenum, and while the skill positions aren't particularly stacked, Emmanuel Sanders is a solid No 1 receiver and I'm excited to see how Courtland Sutton progresses in his second year. The running back tandem of Phillip Lindsay and Royce Freeman should be strong too. No one really fancies Denver at the moment, but I can see them sneaking into a wildcard berth.\n\nAFC - out\n\nBaltimore Ravens\n\nLamar Jackson is set for his first full year as an NFL starter Credit: AP\n\nI think the emergence of Lamar Jackson into a genuine star is going to be one of the storylines of this season, and I still see the Ravens as a nine or 10-win team, but they've lost a lot of firepower on the defensive line and suddenly find themselves in one of football's toughest divisions, so I think they miss out on the post-season by an inch.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers\n\nLos Angeles Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers Credit: AP\n\nThe Chargers pushed the Kansas City Chiefs all the way in the AFC West last season, before being utterly taken apart by the Patriots in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. This year, I don't think they get that chance. The losses of Melvin Gordon (hold out) and Derwin James (injury) and both significant, and while I still think the Chargers have the potential to be an 11-win type team, I think the Broncos surprise everyone by pipping them to second place.\n\nIndianapolis Colts\n\nJacoby Brissett is the new main man for the Colts Credit: AP\n\nThe Colts were a worthy Super Bowl pick before Andrew Luck's retirement shook the NFL. I don't think they should be immediately written off now he's gone - this is still one of the best-built rosters in the league, being guided by an excellent coach - but the smart money is on Indianapolis regressing with Jacoby Brissett under centre. I'd love them to prove me wrong though - what a story that would be.\n\nNFC - in\n\nMinnesota Vikings\n\nDalvin Cook should find more success this year for the Vikings Credit: USA Today\n\nI don't think Kirk Cousins is worth the money Minnesota are paying him at quarterback, but this roster is so strong that I still think they should be able to make a deep run into the postseason, and claim back a crowded NFC North from the Chicago Bears. Dalvin Cook will be a factor again with a hopefully-fixed running game, Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs are among the best receiver tandems in the NFL, and the defense is loaded with top talent, from Danielle Hunter to Harrison Smith.\n\nThe Vikings could perhaps have made more moves to sort an offensive line which leaked badly throughout the 2018. The hope is rookie centre Garrett Bradbury can step in and make an immediate impact in shoring things up.\n\nCarolina Panthers\n\nCam Newton's shoulder holds the key for the Panthers Credit: USA Today\n\nThe Panthers' hopes hang completely on the surgically repaired shoulder of Cameron Jerrell Newton, but if he's close to 100 per cent - as the signs from training camp seem to suggest he is - Carolina could be a real force in the NFC this season. Remember, they were 6-2 before Newton's injury derailed their campaign in 2018.\n\nChristian McCaffrey is comfortably a top five NFL back, and is in the frame to lead the league in scrimmage yards. In DJ Moore and Curtis Samuel they have two young, exciting receivers primed to break out - a scary thought if they do so simultaneously - and smart moves both in the draft and free agency have addressed what was an uncharacteristically disappointing defense last year. Rookie Brian Burns and veterans Gerald McCoy and Bruce Irving should fix an ailing pass rush. I see the Panthers reclaiming an uber-competitive NFC South.\n\nNFC - out\n\nChicago Bears\n\nMitchell Trubisky had a tough opening night against the Packers Credit: AP\n\nThis is a really tough one. I like the Bears a lot and think there's a chance the defense could even improve this season, despite the loss of Fangio and a likely regression towards the mean in terms of turnover count (they led the league with 2.2 per game in 2018). However, questions remain as to whether Mitchell Trubisky is worth the picks Chicago gave up to take him at No 2 overall in 2017 - especially in a draft which included both Deshaun Watson and Patrick Mahomes.\n\nNew Orleans Saints\n\nWill Drew Brees regress in 2019? Credit: AP\n\nI know, I know, but hear me out. Every year there's at least one shock as a team which looks like a surefire contender collapses and misses the playoffs. Remember how many people were picking the Falcons for the Super Bowl last year? Drew Brees' arm low-key fell apart down the stretch last season, and while he often tends to be stronger in the first half of the year, he's now into his 40s - most QBs tend to go the way of Peyton Manning, not Tom Brady, as they battle with Father Time.\n\nIf Brees is the Brees we know and love then I'd be stunned if the Saints don't make the playoffs again, so this one is a total punt in the dark, but the shock has to come from somewhere.
