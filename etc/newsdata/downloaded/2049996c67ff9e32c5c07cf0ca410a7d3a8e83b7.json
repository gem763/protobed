You try to stay off it when the whole country hates you. That's not a fun feeling.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Everybody's like, 'You can't say (expletive) and not expect consequences.' I'm fine with the consequences \u2013 that's it, I'm not arguing. But I do want everyone to know that I have been reading every one of my death threats in an Asian accent.\"\n\nGillis then said that once he was labeled \"a bad guy\" people assumed he is \"alt-right or something.\"\n\nCOMEDY HEAVYWEIGHTS RAIL AGAINST 'CANCEL CULTURE' IN WAKE OF 'SNL' CAST MEMBER'S ABRUPT FIRING\n\n\"For real, though, I did not vote for Donald Trump,\" he said, while winking at the audience, reported USA Today. \"Look at me: I didn't, but that was tough. His whole campaign was at me. 'Are you a fat idiot? Yeah, dude, what're we doing?'\"\n\nGillis then said \"Trump is funny\" and admitted if the president were to come out on stage and roast him after his set \"he'd bury me. He'd come out and be like, 'Fat. Loser. Fired.'\"\n\nThat's when Gillis pivoted to his joke about Trump being shot in an attempt to prove to his audience he's not \"too pro-Trump.\"\n\nANDREW YANG: NEW 'SNL' CAST MEMBER SHANE GILLIS SHOULDN'T LOSE HIS JOB OVER RACIST REMARKS\n\n\"I don't want you to think I'm too pro-Trump,\" Gillis shared. \"I will say this: Of all the presidents I've been alive for, Trump would definitely be the funniest one to see get shot. Like, without a doubt, that'd be funny. I'm not asking for that; I don't want that to happen, but it would be funny to see. He'd be on stage talking (expletive), the shooter would be coming at him, and he'd be like, 'Sit down.' He'd definitely make a funny noise when he got hit. \u2026 It would be funny.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment.\n\nOn Tuesday, NBC announced Gillis would not be on the new season of \"SNL.\" \"We were not aware of his prior remarks that have surfaced over the past few days. The language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable. We are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGillis later issued his own statement on Twitter: \"Of course I wanted an opportunity to prove myself at SNL, but I understand It would too much of a distraction. I respect the decision they made. I'm honestly grateful for the opportunity. I was always a mad tv guy anyway.\"", "description": "Shane Gillis joked that Donald Trump would be \"the funniest\" president \"to see get shot\" in his\u00a0first return to stand-up after the comic was fired from \"Saturday Night Live\" earlier this week.", "authors": ["Sasha Savitsky", "You Can Find Sasha Savitsky On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/shane-gillis-donald-trump-ap-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
