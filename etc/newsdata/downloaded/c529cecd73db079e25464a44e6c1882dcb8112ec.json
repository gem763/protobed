The attack came as state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco has been plotting a massive initial public offering. Yemen's Houthi rebel group claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe Saudi index fell 2.3% at the opening on Sunday before recovering, Reuters reported. The move erased any stock gains on the index for the year, Bloomberg reported.\n\nSmoke is seen following a fire at Aramco facility in the eastern city of Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia, September 14, 2019.

This is 12 to 25 cents per gallon for gasoline.\"\n\nThe extent of the higher prices might not have the same effect on the US economy that it has had in the past, in part because of the rise in US oil production, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. In the 1970s, sky-high oil prices caused by an embargo imposed by Arab oil producers led to a stock-market crash.\n\nBut if it results in higher energy prices, Ryan Kellogg, an economist at the University of Chicago told The Journal, it could be a key part of a global slowdown, which in turn could affect the US.\n\n\"To the extent those slowdowns are going to ripple through the trade system, we could see some of those impacts in the U.S. as well,\" Kellogg told The Journal.\n\nNOW WATCH: Sharks aren't the deadliest creatures on Earth.
