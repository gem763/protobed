From the start, Warren\u2019s campaign was built on the theory that she\u2019s an outsider whom insiders can live with, and an insider who has credibility with outsiders\u2014in 2016 terms, someone who can attract both Sanders and Hillary Clinton voters. Primary voting is months away. The DNC\u2019s 2020 convention is almost a year from now. But on Friday afternoon, in the huge, bland hotel ballroom where the DNC meeting was held, Warren\u2019s theory seemed to be working out.\n\nRead: Elizabeth Warren has momentum. Can she build a movement?\n\nShe \u201cstretches across a broad spectrum of Democrats,\u201d said Don Fowler, a DNC chair in the 1990s, a longtime Clinton-family loyalist, and someone who\u2019s been to more DNC meetings over more election cycles than most people in Democratic politics today. Explaining what he thinks her appeal is to establishment Democrats, Fowler told me that for all of Warren\u2019s talk of \u201cbig, structural change\u201d\u2014by fundamentally reworking the economy\u2014\u201cshe does not include in her presentation the implication of being against things, except the current president.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s insider-outsider routine is one reason, Democratic operatives and analysts told me\u2014and one another, in private conversations\u2014that they\u2019ve begun to see her as the odds-on favorite to win her party\u2019s nomination. However, a few of the Democrats I spoke with noted that her positioning could become a trap: With Sanders and Warren expected to battle even more intensely in the coming months, the change-hungry part of the Democratic base might begin to ask why establishment insiders seem so comfortable with her.\n\nJay Jacobs, the chair of the New York Democratic Party, told me a few hours after Warren\u2019s Friday speech that although his politics aren\u2019t as far left as Warren\u2019s, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a thing she said today that I could not have written.\u201d Jacobs, who was made chair by the Biden-backing Governor Andrew Cuomo, added, \u201cThe times do call for bolder action.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope Sanders supporters see Warren\u2019s broadening support as a good thing and won\u2019t now cynically try to paint her as beholden to insiders, because she\u2019s not,\u201d said a DNC member who isn\u2019t currently committed to any candidates and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWe will see.\u201d\n\nMost of the Democrats I talked to didn\u2019t seem especially upset that Biden did not attend the summer meeting. But they did have their suspicions about why he skipped it: Multiple state-party chairs and other attendees told me\u2014speaking only on the condition of anonymity\u2014that they assumed he was wary of receiving a less-than-wild reception compared with other candidates.\n\nAsked for comment on those assumptions, the Biden spokesman Andrew Bates wouldn\u2019t say whether they were correct or not, but he noted that the former vice president often attends DNC events. \u201cThis weekend he was in New Hampshire, where he had great events speaking directly to voters about the stakes of this election,\u201d Bates said.", "description": "The party insiders at the DNC\u2019s summer meeting seemed unexpectedly drawn to the senator from Massachusetts.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/AP_19235796383307/facebook.jpg?1566777585"}
