Chelsea gave their rookie manager a seventh straight win, taking them level on points with Leicester. The transformation of an ageing team has been propelled by homegrown youngsters, and a potentially tricky trip to Turf Moor became a sweet affair for the 21-year-old from Hershey, Pennsylvania. Pulisic\u2019s first Chelsea goals were a perfect hat-trick, in more ways than one, scored with his left foot, his right and his head, capping a stunning display. It offered ample evidence of why Chelsea paid \u00a358m for him and brought the rare sound of their fans chorusing: \u201cUSA, USA.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am absolutely delighted for him,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cIt was a fantastic match-winning appearance. He showed the full package. There has been a lot of talk around Christian for the big price tag. He is quite rightly a star in his own country. I know the back story and the pressure of the move. He [only] had a week\u2019s break in the summer, so why am I going to throw him in?\u201d\n\nManchester City\u2019s Raheem Sterling breaks Aston Villa\u2019s resistance Read more\n\nPulisic has had to be patient \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was going to be super easy,\u201d he said \u2013 but after a frustrating two months, when the American has been a bit-part player and has not even made the bench at times, this was an explosion of excellence. Pulisic has been overshadowed by Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham but, on his first league start since August, he upstaged them, taking the striker\u2019s record as Chelsea\u2019s youngest hat-trick scorer in the Premier League. A first treble of his senior career came as such a surprise to the scorer that he forgot to claim the match ball. His teammates duly collected and signed it. It was the least they could do.\n\nRewarded for his catalytic cameo against Ajax, when he set up Michy Batshuayi\u2019s winner, Pulisic made the most of his promotion. His opener was all of his own making. In different ways, he exposed three of the Burnley back four. He caught Matt Lowton dawdling in possession and surged away. He had the skill to dart past James Tarkowski and his angled shot went through Ben Mee\u2019s legs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chelsea\u2019s Christian Pulisic completes his perfect hat-trick with his head after opening the scoring with his left foot before rifling in his, and Chelsea\u2019s second, with his right foot.

Yet this was emphatic and exhilarating, ambitious and auspicious. \u201cIt is a fun team to play with now,\u201d Pulisic said.\n\nChristian Pulisic begins to justify his presence in a Chelsea shirt Read more\n\nThe luckless Lowton was tormented while the demoted Callum Hudson-Odoi produced the wrong answer. The substitute\u2019s brief appearance was notable for the award of a penalty, which was reversed by VAR, with replays proving that, far from being fouled by Tarkowski, the winger had dived. \u201cYoung players are the future of the game,\u201d added Dyche. \u201cIf they are diving now, we have massive trouble in five or 10 years\u2019 time.\u201d\n\nHis own side had a different set of difficulties, even if some were alleviated by a spirited comeback. Jay Rodriguez\u2019s spectacular goal represented a belated first top-flight strike at Turf Moor for his hometown club while Dwight McNeil, who troubled C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, got the goal his excellence merited. Burnley\u2019s more meaningful opportunities were spurned earlier. Often the talisman and a player Chelsea once coveted, Ashley Barnes endured an off-day.\n\nThe \u00a3450,000 signing misjudged and miscued a series of chances. \u201cAt the top end of the market they are often more clinical,\u201d Dyche added.
