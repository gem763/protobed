Obviously, there were too many (missed tackles). Those two wingers are exceptional.\u201d\n\nEdwards was addressing Wales\u2019 almost costly defensive failings against Fiji in the Rugby World Cup, a day before their last Pool D match against Uruguay in Kumamoto.\n\nTo Edwards, the otherworldly brilliance of Tuisova and Radradra mitigates the missed tackles.\n\nNaturally, the backs were the most exposed, and nobody was perfect. Scrumhalf Gareth Davies missed five of his 14 tackles against the Fijians last Wednesday, Dan Biggar three, Hadleigh Parkes three with his broken right hand, and Jonathan Davies two. Josh Adams scored three tries, but after missing two tackles that led to Fiji\u2019s two tries in the first 10 minutes.\n\nThe defense was led up front by captain Alun Wyn Jones, who made 16 of his 18 tackles, fellow lock Jake Ball, who nabbed all 11 of his tackles, and flanker James Davies, who nailed all 13 of his attempts.\n\nBall hasn\u2019t missed anyone within range yet, going 27-0 in tackles in the tournament. Captain Jones has been successful with the most, 47.\n\nAll, apart from Parkes and Adams, are not starting against Uruguay, and Edwards doesn\u2019t expect a similar falloff. He expects much better.\n\nAnd he knows they can\u2019t afford to miss 32 against likely quarterfinal opponent France next week.\n\n\u201cFrance have talented individuals, similar athletes, and we do need to improve that situation,\u201d Edwards said.\n\nAs usual, he has set the Welsh a target to limit the opposition to. Wales conceded 14 points against Georgia and 25 against Australi, both scores more than Edwards wanted. Wales hit its target against Fiji (17).\n\n\u201cYou have to realize there has never been as many points scored in rugby union as there is now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf teams get near your line, it\u2019s pick and go. It\u2019s important I set realistic targets, which I feel like I do.\n\n\u201cThey (Uruguay) are a good attacking unit, but we just have to turn up with the right attitude tomorrow and put in a performance that we can be proud of.\u201d\n\nWales is unbeaten and keen to beat Uruguay to sweep its first Rugby World Cup pool since 1987.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Stopping attacks is Shaun Edwards' pride and joy.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
