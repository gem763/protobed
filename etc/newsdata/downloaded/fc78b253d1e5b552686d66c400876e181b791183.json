Among them: Rats, sugar gliders and a hedgehog.", "language": "en", "text": "Melissa Hamilton, 49; Gregg Nelson, 57; and Susan Nelson, 43, are facing charges of three counts of child abuse and 66 counts of animal cruelty, according to police.\n\nAccording to the charging affidavit, Gregg Nelson was ready to end his relationship with his wife, Susan Nelson, and his live-in girlfriend, Hamilton. He wanted to take his three daughters with him, but his wife wouldn\u2019t allow him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGregg Nelson requested a wellness check, stating that the residence was uninhabitable for his children.\n\nWhen Officer Anthony Binz arrived, Susan Nelson told him that her home was a mess and that she was in the process of cleaning it and re-homing the animals, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe acrid odor of ammonia assaulted Binz\u2019s nose while he was standing in the driveway, according to his narrative in the charging document.\n\nWhen the officer entered the home, he saw various species of animals, according to the police report. Some of the animals were caged and sat in their own urine and feces. Some were without any food or water. All the animals appeared to be infested with fleas, and some appeared to have mange.\n\nAD\n\nBinz also found animals that appeared to have been dead for a while because of inadequate care and nutrition, according to the police report.\n\nAD\n\nA police video shows a dog inside a cage with a plastic funnel and what looks like a sink on top of it. An officer pans to the left, where a small, thin black dog sits on gray material in front of a plastic bin that contains egg cartons. A water bottle and a soda can are in front of the dog. A walk up the wooden hallway exposes a large litter box among various forms of trash as dogs bark in the background. At the end of the hallway are two rooms that appear to be in disarray.\n\nThe police video pivots to the left as a light shines on a bunk bed with no top mattress. The floor wasn\u2019t visible because of the piled-up garbage, which was ankle deep, according to the police report.\n\nAD\n\nThere was nowhere to walk in the home without stepping on debris or animal waste. The counters and furniture were also covered in debris, according to the charging affidavit, and flies plagued the entire house.\n\nAD\n\nBinz wrote that the home was \u201cthe absolute worst residence\u201d he had been to in his five years as an officer because of the \u201coverwhelming odor of ammonia [and] animal hoarding\u201d and the overall living conditions, according to his report.\n\nHe notified the Department of Children and Families, calling for an immediate response. The agency removed the three girls \u2014 a 7-year-old, a 9-year-old and a 10-year old \u2014 from the three-bedroom, two-bath home and sent them to stay with a family member, according to police.\n\nAD\n\nMore chaos followed.\n\nGregg Nelson said he was having chest pains and requested an ambulance. He was later taken to a hospital.\n\nHamilton said she had taken 17 Xanax pills to end her life because she felt everything was going to be taken from her, according to the police report. She was also taken to a local facility for treatment and evaluation.\n\nAD\n\nSusan Nelson, who remained on the scene, signed a consent form that allowed officers to enter her home and another form that allowed the animals to be removed. She wasn\u2019t under arrest at the time and could have revoked her consent at any time, according to the police report.\n\nBy the time paperwork had been completed, Susan Nelson had been transported to the Volusia County Branch Jail with no bond. Gregg Nelson is in Edgewater police custody, according to police, and Hamilton is at another facility because of her suicide attempt. Law enforcement will be notified of her release, as a holdover affidavit will be in place for her arrest.\n\nAD\n\nAgencies in the community are pooling time and resources to help the children and the animals as they recover from conditions that are likely to have lasting physical or psychological effects, experts say.\n\nAD\n\nMore animals died on their way to the Edgewater Animal Shelter, said administrative assistant and volunteer coordinator Renee Sortman.\n\nSortman said two guinea pigs died in the \u201call hands on deck\u201d effort to care for the animals.\n\n\u201cNone of them were in good condition,\u201d she said, noting that all the animals showed some form of neglect, including dehydration.\n\nPolice reported that, in total, the home contained four dogs, two cats, nine live guinea pigs, 12 rabbits, four hamsters, 10 sugar gliders, 14 birds, a gecko, a tortoise, a hedgehog, seven bearded dragons, a leopard-spotted gecko, 95 mice and 60 adult rats with 23 babies.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is a unique case here,\u201d Sortman said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen something like this for a while.\u201d\n\nAnimal hoarding, however, isn\u2019t unique, said Randall Lockwood, former senior vice president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\u2019 Anti-Cruelty Speciality Projects.\n\nAD\n\nLockwood said there have been cases of animal hoarding where the total number of animals nears 1,000, but the average case is 50 to 60 animals.\n\nASPCA estimates that about a quarter-million animals fall victim to hoarding.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell how long the rehabilitation of the animals will take, Sortman said.\n\nEach animal could need a different amount of recovery time, according to Lockwood, who said dogs fare better at being brought back from extreme neglect, compared with their feline counterparts, which are more susceptible to death from parasites. Some animals never completely recover, he said.\n\nAD\n\nWhy the Nelsons and Hamilton lived with so many animals is under investigation, according to Edgewater Police Department officials.\n\nThe department is accepting donations of clothes, toys and money for the girls.\n\nAD\n\nLockwood pointed out that animal hoarding is recognized as a serious mental illness listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\n\n\u201cIt is something that\u2019s very resistant to treatment,\u201d he said, noting that he has seen animal hoarders move from state to state throughout his career. \u201cWe know without intervention, without monitors, there is a very strong likelihood that this would be repeated again.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "A police officer performing a wellness check said it was \u201cthe absolute worst residence\u201d he had visited in his five years on the force.", "authors": ["Lateshia Beachum"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QdpGJshytWZ5mNMxwbC64ct93qU=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-21-2019/t_5652afea92b7401b9b3ad330a64634b5_name_dog.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
