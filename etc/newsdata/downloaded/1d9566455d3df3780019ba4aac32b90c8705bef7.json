And it was interesting that they had a divide between those two things because I don't think I'm the first artist in the world to be funny or to dress up, but they saw those things as exclusive or something. And I thought, 'That's interesting, I can play with this' and whenever anybody throws me out a little unconscious insult like that, I always roll with it. And so I've always thought, 'OK we are going to make them deal with that. I'm both and you got to deal with it.\"\n\nThrough his art Perry challenges perceptions of traditional masculinity.\n\nHe had a lack of male role models throughout his turbulent childhood and explores the idea of a more flexible masculinity,\n\nPerry refers to British society as a 'them and us mentality' which he says arose during the Brexit campaign.\n\nThe exhibition is at the Monnaie De Paris Art Gallery from the 19 October - 3 Feb 2019.", "description": "An English contemporary artist, well known for his cross dressing as well as his ceramic vases, sculptures and tapestries is showing his works at his first French solo exhibition in Paris", "authors": ["Louise Miner"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/38/78/78/1000x563_cmsv2_b753c8a8-6d0f-5fb8-bf00-7ae6bb351eb5-3387878.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-20"}
