America should keep their word.\"\n\nMr Trump defended his decision in a series of breathless tweets, writing: \u201cI was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don\u2019t even like the USA (sic).\u201d\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, a top Republican ally of Mr Trump, said Congress could impose economic sanctions on Turkey and threaten its Nato membership if Ankara invaded Syria.\n\nA female fighter of the US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) flashes the victory gesture while celebrating near the Omar oil field in the eastern Syrian Deir Ezzor province on March 23, 2019, after announcing the total elimination of the Islamic State (IS) group's last bastion in eastern Syria.

This does not include the more than 70,000 women and children held in detention camps would could also be at risk.\n\nThe White House statement announcing the news was released shortly after a phone call between Mr Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday night.\n\nForeign prisoners in Syria detained by the SDF in Baghuz during the battle for Isil's last stronghold Credit: CBS More", "description": "Donald Trump's allies have turned on the president after he took the decision to green-light an offensive by Turkish on its Kurdish allies in Syria.
