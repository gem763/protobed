When he comes up against the Springboks this afternoon, the powerful flanker will be among the more recognisable players to their opponents \u2013 from his Super Rugby days with the Chiefs and the \u201cMiracle of Brighton\u201d four years ago. The carry happy Leitch is the heart and soul of the Japanese, driving them on with each of his runs down the tramlines, with an offload and a stinging hand-off always at the ready.\n\n\n\nKotaro Matsushima (Wing, 26)\n\nSouth Africans have been claiming Matsushima for four years since he came to prominence at the last World Cup, what with his having been born in Pretoria to a Zimbabwean father and a Japanese mother. Who wouldn\u2019t want to claim the joint top try scoring winger at the current World Cup? Before this weekend\u2019s matches, Matsushima was tied on five tries with Wales\u2019 Josh Adams and within three of the tournament record of eight held by Jonah Lomu and Bryan Habana. Matsushima has been critical for Japan, scoring a hat-trick in the nervy opener against Russia, the bonus point try against Scotland and fashioning 11 clean breaks, beating 22 men and running 350m in the process.\n\n\n\nKazuki Himeno (Number eight, 25)\n\nThis guy has got pain in the backside written all over him. He may be the lesser-known third loose-forward in a loose-trio which includes Lappies Labuschagne and Leitch, but Himeno presents multifaceted problems. If he\u2019s not carrying as hard as the day is long, the Sunwolves man is a thieving bastard at rucks \u2013 all of this at a relentless intensity.\n\n\n\nSOUTH AFRICA\n\nSiya Kolisi (Flank, 28)\n\nIf there is a criticism of the Springbok captain, it is that he can concentrate a little too much on his own game and not on the game itself. There comes a time when the skipper has to eschew the whole leading by example thing to keep his finger on the match\u2019s pulse. Looking at how the Boks have chosen their team for this game, sticking to Rassie Erasmus\u2019 playing script will be paramount, and Kolisi has to see to it that the game plan is implemented.\n\n\n\nCheslin Kolbe (Wing, 25)\n\nCompared to Matsushima and Adams, Kolbe has only scored two tries in the competition. Yet he has still captured the imagination, thanks to a rugby intellect that is as razor sharp as he is fast and his body is agile. It\u2019s not just his electric, \u201cwe\u2019re coming for everything\u201d style of play that has caught the eye, the numbers don\u2019t lie as 15 beaten defenders and six clean breaks at almost 13m per carry tell a story.\n\nPieter-Steph du Toit (Flank, 27)\n\nIt speaks volumes for the kind of World Cup Kolbe has had that he has pushed Du Toit out of the limelight somewhat with his performances. But make no mistake, when there\u2019s a big game to be won, there\u2019s usually a big performance from Du Toit, be it through tireless carrying, an insane desire to tackle anything that moves or availing himself as a line-out option.", "description": "Here are three key players from each side.", "authors": ["Simnikiwe Xabanisa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9370/78e20ffaa0084cec9feacd5bb253b50b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
