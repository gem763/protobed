USA TODAY\n\nTimes have been tough for the Kansas football program.\n\nThe Jayhawks entered Saturday night with just five wins in Big 12 Conference play this entire decade \u2013 and one of those victories was against a team that isn't even in the conference anymore.\n\nBut on Saturday, Kansas got its first Big 12 win under Les Miles thanks in part to a catastrophic mistake by Texas Tech.\n\nWith the score tied at 34, Kansas lined up to kick a potential game-winning field goal with 13 seconds to go. Liam Jones' 40-yard try was blocked by the Red Raiders, but Douglas Coleman III fumbled the ball on the return when he appeared to try pitching the ball back to a teammate ... who wasn't really there.\n\nThe Kansas Jayhawks storm the field after beating the Texas Tech Red Raiders.

The Jayhawks sit at 3-5, but nearly beat Texas a week ago in Austin and they secured the program's first road win over a Power Five foe in over a decade when they hammered Boston College earlier this year.\n\nOn Saturday, quarterback Carter Stanley led the way with an impressive 415-yard, three-touchdown day. Kansas fought out of 17-0 and 27-14 holes en route to the exciting victory.", "description": "A Texas Tech fumble after a blocked field goal in the final seconds gave Kansas one final opportunity to get a rare win in Big 12 Conference play.", "authors": ["Jace Evans", "Published P.M.
