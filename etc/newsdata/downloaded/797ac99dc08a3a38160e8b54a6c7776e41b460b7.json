They mentioned names of different battles. But they\u2019re there to help us with their land and that\u2019s a different thing.\u201d\n\nTrump did not specify to which article he was referring, but some on Twitter pointed to an article written in TownHall by conservative Kurt Schlichter that included a reference to the Kurds and Normandy.\n\nThe remarks from Trump at the White House came as Turkey launched an offensive in northern Syria against Kurdish forces that had been allied with the United States in the fight on terror.\n\nTrump paved the way for the Turkish offensive when he announced earlier this week, to a GOP furor, that he was withdrawing U.S. forces from that part of Syria. Some of Trump's staunchest Republican allies have ripped the move, calling it a betrayal of a loyal U.S. ally in the Kurds.\n\nTrump insisted the U.S. has spent \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d helping the Kurds purchase ammunition and weapons.\n\n\u201cWith all of that being said, we liked the Kurds,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\n\u201cWhen you say they\u2019re fighting for us, yes, but they\u2019re fighting for their land,\u201d Trump added.\n\nThe White House announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces abruptly late Sunday after Trump spoke with Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\n\nThe U.S. military partnered with the Syrian Democratic Forces, led by the Kurds, in operations against ISIS. Turkey considers the Syrian Kurds to be a terrorist group.\n\nSyrian Democratic Forces have denounced Trump's decision as a \u201cstab in the back.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to contain the scrutiny over the past days, insisting the president did not give a \u201cgreenlight\u201d to Turkey to conduct the operation and that he made clear to Erdo\u011fan that there would be consequences for Turkey if Kurdish forces were harmed.\n\n\u201cI will wipe out his economy if that happens,\u201d Trump told reporters Wednesday. \u201cI hope that he will act rationally.\u201d\n\nTrump also insisted his decision had \u201ctremendous support\u201d outside Washington and noted he campaigned on withdrawing the U.S. from \u201cendless wars.\u201d", "description": "President Trump on Wednesday criticized the Kurds, saying they didn't help the United States during World War II and that they were only fighting for their land in Syria during the battle against ISIS.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald2_100919getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
