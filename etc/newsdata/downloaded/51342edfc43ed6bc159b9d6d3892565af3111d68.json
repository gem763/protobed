And surviving doesn\u2019t always mean fighting on the front lines.\u201d\n\nMiller, who recently published her critically acclaimed memoir \u201cKnow My Name,\u201d wrote the essay for Glamour\u2019s Women of the Year issue. Before she publicly identified herself for the first time last month, she was honored as one of the magazine\u2019s Women of the Year in 2016 for her now-famous victim impact statement she read in court at Turner\u2019s sentencing hearing.\n\n\u201cSometimes being a survivor means drinking enough water and sleeping well at night. Just facing the day can require courage,\u201d Miller continued. \u201cFight, but just as important, rest. It\u2019s society that needs to do more, to learn how to listen, to hold the space for survivors and hold perpetrators accountable.\u201d\n\nTurner, a former Stanford University student, was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious Miller behind a dumpster during a 2015 fraternity party. He served only three months of a six-month jail sentence after being released early on good behavior in August 2016.\n\nHe faced up to 14 years in prison, but then-Judge Aaron Persky said prison would \u201chave a severe impact\u201d on Turner and handed down the lenient punishment. Outraged voters later approved Persky\u2019s recall from the bench.\n\n\u201cEvery survivor who came before me has taught me how to be ready. They have cleared a path,\u201d Miller wrote. \u201cI have taken my time restoring, learning how to dig my tunnel. Now I proudly walk up it and join them.\u201d\n\nHead over to Glamour to read Miller\u2019s full essay.", "description": "The woman who was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner in 2015 shared her wisdom with fellow survivors in a Glamour essay.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db85851210000bb3634b5e0.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
