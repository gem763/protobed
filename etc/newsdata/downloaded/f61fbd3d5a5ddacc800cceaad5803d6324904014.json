That dwarfs, Crews noted, 2015\u2019s count of 80,260 pages, and it shattered the 2010 all-time record of 81,405 by 15,705 pages.\n\nThe overwhelming number of regulations was just one issue. The former White House also established vague, undisclosed interpretations of federal regulations.\n\nThe Trump Administration moved quickly to reverse Obama\u2019s paradigm. Almost immediately upon taking office, the new President demanded that for every new regulation introduced, 2 old ones must be cut. Agencies have been forced to comply. So far, 14 regulations have been cut for every significant new one implemented.\n\nAdditionally, the White House demanded that agencies place their guidance documents on easily searchable public websites. Bureaucracies are now required to permit citizens to give their input on these guidelines, and they will have the ability to ask agencies to withdraw guidance they believe is wrong. Agencies are also prohibited from enforcing rules that have not been made publicly known.\n\nThe latest Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom notes that,\n\n\u201cThe U.S.\u2019s economic freedom ranking has risen six places, and its overall score in the 2019 Index is the highest recorded since 2011. This improvement reflects the impact of major regulatory and tax reforms on economic growth, investment, and business confidence. In 2018, the unemployment rate fell to its lowest point since 1969. Significant regulatory reform has resulted in the delay or withdrawal of 2,253 pending regulatory actions since January 2017.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the American Action Forum (AAF) noted that the Trump Administration was slashing regulations at a record pace. The study found that approximately $16.4 billion in regulations emanating from 70 agencies were cut.\n\nA Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) analysis found that,\n\n\u201cIn 2017, Trump\u2019s first year, the Federal Register finished 2017 at 61,308 pages, the lowest count since 1993 and a 36 percent drop from President Barack Obama\u2019s 95,894 pages in 2016, which had been the highest level in history.\u201d\n\nIn its 2019 \u201c10,000 Commandments\u201d report, CEI outlines key facts:\n\nThe estimated $1.9 trillion \u201chidden tax\u201d of regulation is greater than the corporate and personal income taxes combined. If the cost of federal regulations were a country, it would be the 9th largest, behind India and just ahead of Canada.\n\nEach U.S. household\u2019s estimated regulatory burden is at least $14,615 annually on average. That amounts to 20 percent of the average pre-tax household budget and exceeds every item in that budget, except housing.\n\nIn 2018, the Trump administration issued 3,368 rules. That\u2019s more than the 3,281 final rules in 2017, which was the lowest number of regulations coming out of federal agencies in a single year since the National Archives began publishing rule counts in 1976.\n\nIn 2017, President Trump\u2019s first year, the Federal Register finished at 61,308 pages, the lowest count since 1993 and a 36 percent drop from former President Barack Obama\u2019s 95,894 pages, which had been the highest level in history. The 2018 Federal Register rose to 68,082 pages (however Trump\u2019s rollback of rules can add to rather than subtract from the Register).\n\nIn the pipeline now, 67 federal departments, agencies, and commissions have 3,534 regulatory actions at various stages of implementation(recently \u201cCompleted,\u201d \u201cActive,\u201d and \u201cLong-term\u201d stages), according to the fall 2018 \u201cRegulatory Plan and the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions.\u201d\n\nOf the 3,534 regulations in the Agenda\u2019s pipeline, 174 are \u201ceconomically significant\u201d rules, which the federal government describes as having annual economic effects of $100 million or more. Of those 174, 38 are deemed \u201cderegulatory\u201d for purposes of E.O. 13,771.\n\nFrank Vernuccio serves as editor-in-chief of the New York Analysis of Policy & Government.", "description": "One of the most significant differences in domestic policy between .10/19/2019 6:41:34AM EST.", "authors": ["Frank Vernuccio", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/175/68b0fae6-b110-476c-a5fd-6f8e7fe5a4eb.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
