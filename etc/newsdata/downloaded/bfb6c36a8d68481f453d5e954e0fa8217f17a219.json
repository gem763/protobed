Lindsey Graham, who has been trying to shape President Donald Trump's thinking on Afghanistan, is one of a number of senators who Trump leans on for advice on matters of war and peace. | Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images Congress John Bolton\u2019s gone \u2014 and Republicans want in The Senate's doves could benefit from the national security adviser's exit.\n\nJohn Bolton\u2019s ouster from the Trump administration creates an immediate void on President Donald Trump\u2019s national security team as the president weighs critical decisions about the war on Afghanistan.\n\nIt\u2019s a vacuum that a number of Senate Republicans are eager to fill.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSenators who have been trying to shape President Donald Trump\u2019s thinking on foreign policy \u2014 especially the peace talks in Afghanistan \u2014 are now jockeying for more influence over the president\u2019s thinking. With an interventionist hawk like Bolton out of the picture, Trump, who campaigned on winding down the United States\u2019 engagement overseas, may be more inclined to limit foreign engagements.\n\nBolton had been a fierce opponent of striking a deal with the Taliban and told the president he could draw down troops without a deal. His exit is likely to boost Capitol Hill\u2019s more dovish members whose advice tends to accord with the president\u2019s own instincts.\n\nManeuvering on the Hill to influence the president on the questions of Afghanistan escalated immediately on Tuesday in the wake of Bolton\u2019s exit.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s long expressed a desire to bring America\u2019s longest war to an end,\u201d said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who celebrated Bolton\u2019s withdrawal. \u201cHe needs to have somebody in the positions advising him that actually agree with his policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president deserves a national security adviser he has confidence in,\u201d agreed Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). But the agreement stops there: Graham is urging Trump to do precisely the opposite of what Paul wants.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n\u201cThe intel is very clear what will happen if you pull the plug on Afghanistan,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that [Trump] will not do in Afghanistan what we did in Iraq.\u201d\n\nBoth Graham and Paul speak with Trump frequently and are almost always at odds over national security, with Graham advocating a muscular military approach and Paul unceasingly advocating diplomacy. They are among a number of senators who Trump leans on for advice on matters of war and peace, including Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Several other senators use the media to make their case on foreign policy, appearing on Fox News and speaking with Capitol Hill reporters hoping their message will reach the White House.\n\n\"We do have a lot of people who talk to the president on a regular basis who have very informed views when it comes to matters of national security and foreign policy,\" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.). \"So I suspect whatever kind of void is there, he\u2019ll have a lot of voices in his ear.\"\n\nBolton\u2019s departure also exposed the messy debate within the Republican Party itself. The GOP remains painfully divided over national security, with Trump\u2019s three years in office leaving unresolved whether the party itself can reach consensus on how and when the U.S. should deploy its armed forces.\n\nThat means that while Trump will be getting plenty of input in the wake of Bolton\u2019s sacking, it will often be contradictory. The first issue on which the two factions are likely clash is on whether the president should continue with a plan to draw down troops in Afghanistan even though the president has called off peace talks with the Taliban.\n\nBolton is \u201ca brilliant man. And his alternate point of view I hoped would be welcomed in decision-making circles,\u201d said Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who panned planned negotiations with the Taliban. On Afghanistan \u201cwe need to rethink our entire approach. And the president said that the negotiations are dead. If that\u2019s the case, well, how we go forward is now an entirely new discussion.\u201d\n\nBolton\u2019s exit \u201cmeans that Pompeo is the guy that\u2019s going to lead the approach. And I have confidence in him. I\u2019m one that has gotten fatigued with the whole process there,\u201d said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), who has a libertarian streak on foreign policy and is open to negotiating with the Taliban. \u201cNow that I know what occurred [with Bolton], I think we\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\n\nLike so much of the president\u2019s decision-making, however, Bolton\u2019s ouster occurred after little apparent coordination with his allies on Capitol Hill. Braun learned about the news from a reporter after spending his morning in meetings: \u201cWhat\u2019s that? Bolton is out. That happened this morning?\u201d\n\nAnd Senate Armed Services Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) learned of the news after a staffer heard about Bolton on the radio.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to miss a lot of real value by not having John Bolton there,\u201d Inhofe lamented. \u201cUnfortunately, personalities override a lot of things.\u201d\n\nBut to some on the Hill, the takeaway from Tuesday was familiar: Trump\u2019s advisers and his allies in Congress can say what they want on Afghanistan. But like his gut decision to get rid of Bolton an hour before he was scheduled to attend a joint press briefing with Pompeo, Trump will always consider himself his top advisor.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s going to do what the president wants to do on Afghanistan. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m suggesting that he\u2019s not listening for input,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). Then he subsequently offered his own.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3857/1155968404_6085050604001_6085042811001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201casking questions: \u2018we\u2019ve been there for a long time, why are we there? My answer is that we\u2019re there to prevent, to the extent that we can, the country from becoming a breeding ground for terrorists that will attack the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen and if Trump makes a decision on whether to follow through on a planned partial withdrawal in Afghanistan, Republicans hope it doesn\u2019t go down like Trump\u2019s pullout in Syria, which shocked them and led to them piling their frustrations onto Vice President Mike Pence at a private party meeting last year.\n\nSo with a power void in the White House and huge decisions about Afghanistan now up in the air, Republicans are making their case ahead of time. One lawmaker who speaks frequently with the White House warned that a pullout in Afghanistan could be a political disaster for Trump\u2019s reelection if the void there leads to a resurgence of terrorist attacks originating from the country.\n\n\u201cI do worry about a total pullout,\u201d added Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). \u201cIf the Taliban is still killing Americans and al Qaeda is still promising to work with the Taliban, we\u2019ve got a long way to go.\u201d\n\nCountered Cruz: \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to begin to bring our troops home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been there a very long time. We have lost a lot of good men and women,\u201d Cruz said, advocating to abandon efforts to \u201cproduce a democratic utopia in Afghanistan. Our mission should instead be focused narrowly on protecting the vital national security interests of the United States.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The Senate's doves could benefit from the national security adviser's exit.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett", "Eliana Johnson"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8a/e6/605579384e599f33e9d3ced59ba1/190910-lindsey-graham-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
