Pringle said the chain planned to open two dark kitchens in the US by the end of the year, having already utilized the design internationally.\n\nWendy's plans to use dark kitchens in high-delivery areas, as well as in regions where the chain has not yet opened locations due to high real estate costs or other restraints. And, the fast-food chain isn't alone in turning to ghost kitchens to boost delivery sales without making massive investments.\n\nRead more: Fast food turns to 'ghost kitchens' and restaurants on wheels as chains like &pizza and Chick-fil-A battle for delivery dominance\n\nChains including The Halal Guys, Sweetgreen, and Chick-fil-A have partnered with leading ghost-kitchen brand Kitchen United to offer delivery out of a shared commercial kitchen. In September, Kitchen United closed on a $40 million Series B funding round led by real estate company RXR Realty and GV (formerly Google Ventures).\n\nKitchen United plans to enter the New York City market as part of its relationship with RXR Realty. The company has 13 more locations in the pipeline, with plans to have eight kitchens open by the end of the year. It aims to ultimately open 400 locations over the next four years.\n\nThe ghost kitchen craze is being driven by the explosion of delivery options in fast food.\n\nUberEats, Postmates, GrubHub, and other third-party delivery companies are partnering with chains, many of which are just now offering delivery for the first time. Food delivery is set to become a $75.9 billion business by 2022, according to a 2018 Cowen & Co. report. That's more than triple the $23.2 billion in delivery sales that were done in 2011.\n\nAs delivery becomes a larger portion of chains' sales, delivery-centric locations are likely to make up a greater number of fast-food shops around the US. The concept of what a fast-food location looks like is fundamentally transforming \u2014 and ghost kitchens are set to play a major role.", "description": "Wendy's became the latest fast-food chain to name-check ghost kitchens on Friday at the company's investor day.", "authors": ["Kate Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0b93e4af909692357b0a4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
