Ostara helps communities and companies around the world clean water and grow more food by recovering valuable nutrients from where they shouldn\u2019t be \u2013in water \u2013 and transforming them into high-performing sustainable fertilizers, proven to increase yields while reducing runoff.\n\nVANCOUVER, BC, CANADA and RIVERVIEW, FL, USA, Oct. 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technologies Inc. (\u201cOstara\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announced today the closing of an initial tranche of financing for proceeds of approximately US$5M, comprising part of a larger financing being conducted by the Company for aggregate proceeds of up to US$16.5M (the \u201cFinancing\u201d). The Financing is being co-led by long-standing Ostara investors, Wheatsheaf Group Limited and VantagePoint Capital Partners, with follow-on participation by other existing Ostara shareholders. Proceeds of the Financing will be used to accelerate near-term scaling of fertilizer production at Ostara\u2019s Southeastern US-based toll granulator, to support continued growth of the Company\u2019s fertilizer sales and nutrient recovery systems in the US, Europe and Asia, and for other strategic purposes.\n\n\u201cOstara is truly at the center of an industry shift where end-users are, more than ever, demanding new crop nutrition solutions that not only provide excellent agronomics but which are also environmentally responsible; our corporate philosophy is built on these fundamentals and we are fortunate to be supported by sophisticated investors who are fully aligned with our strategy,\u201d said Dan Parmar, President and CEO of Ostara. \u201cFor our fiscal year just ended, we outsold production of our Crystal Green\u00ae fertilizer, selling more than four times our volumes sold in the previous fiscal year, and we are on track to significantly better those results this year. As a result, we recently contracted Southwestern US-based tolling capacity to feed into this product demand and funds from this Financing will be used to fast-track production scale-up and capacity enhancements for that facility and to further support fertilizer and technology system sales globally.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the past six months, Ostara has scaled up its sustainable fertilizer production to meet the demand arising from a growing recognition within the market of the value its products offer. We are excited to be playing a key role in supporting Ostara as it continues to expand its profile in this rapidly evolving industry and we believe the consumer trends driving this growth are here for the long term,\u201d said Graham Ramsbottom, CEO of Wheatsheaf Group Limited, a UK-based organization that directly operates, invests in and helps to develop businesses in the food and agriculture sector to meet the growing demands of a changing global population.\n\n\u201cVantagePoint has always been an enthusiastic supporter of companies that combine sound business principles with leading-edge technology and a sustainability focus, and the Ostara story is no exception\u201d, said Tom Bevilacqua, Managing Director with Financing co-lead VantagePoint Capital Partners, a global venture investor, supporting companies from start-up to scale-up with a special focus on resource innovation and efficiency. \u201cWe believe Ostara is uniquely positioned to significantly change the way in which food is grown around the world and we are excited to continue to provide meaningful capital to augment the tremendous growth being made by the Company.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technologies Inc.\n\nOstara reimagines resources, helping communities around the world clean water to grow more food. The Company\u2019s Pearl\u00ae technology recovers phosphorus and nitrogen from industrial, agricultural, and municipal water streams, and transforms these nutrients into its premium, sustainable Crystal Green\u00ae fertilizers which are sold into the agriculture and turf sectors through a network of established distributors in North America and Europe. Crystal Green\u00ae is the first slow-release phosphorus fertilizer to release nutrients in response to plant demand; these Root-Activated\u2122 granules are proven to increase yields, enhance soil health and significantly reduce phosphorus tie-up and runoff, thereby improving food security while protecting local waterways from nutrient pollution.
