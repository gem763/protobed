The \u00a31bn private litigation case was due to resume in the high court's new Rolls building. It was scheduled to be one of the biggest battles in British legal history, with more than 70 witnesses \u2013 some of whom were to give evidence anonymously for their own protection.\n\nDeripaska was scheduled to go into the witness box in November. His fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea FC, had agreed to give evidence in support of Deripaska, one of Russia's richest men and the owner of Rusal, the world's largest aluminium producer. The case would have shed light on one of the murkiest episodes in Russia's bloody post-Soviet history, when rival groups and organised crime bosses fought for control of the country's lucrative aluminium industry. The so-called \"aluminium wars\" were characterised by a series of gangland-style murders, political skulduggery and extortion claimed at the highest levels.\n\nCherney claimed that during this period under President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s he was Deripaska's business partner. Cherney alleged that he had a beneficial interest in the Sibal aluminium company, which later merged with Sibneft to form Rusal. Deripaska vehemently denied the claim as part of his legal battle.\n\nAccording to Deripaska, the arrangement between the two men was simply one of \"krysha\" \u2014 the Russian word for \"roof\" \u2014 with Deripaska paying Cherney and his mafia partners huge sums of money in return for physical and political protection. Cherney denied this and said that without his help Deripaska \u2013 now a close ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin \u2013 would never have become a major player in the industry.\n\nAbramovich successfully used a similar krysha defence in his recent high court battle against the long-term Kremlin critic Boris Berezovsky. The case ended in humiliation for Berezovsky, the plaintiff, who announced this week he would not be appealing against a crushing judgement against him by Lady Justice Gloster.\n\nAides to Deripaska suggested that Gloster's ruling \u2013 acknowledging the existence of krysha arrangements \u2013 had clearly strengthened the Rusal owner's case. But they refused to comment on the nature of the settlement or answer whether one party had paid money to the other.\n\nCherney had claimed that in March 2001 he and Deripaska reached an agreement in a London hotel. In it, Cherney said, Deripaska agreed to pay him $250m (\u00a3154m) for his share of Sibal, together with 20% per cent of the shares, to be transferred at a later stage. Cherney complained that he never got the shares.\n\nThe case began in July. Cherney was unable to travel to London to attend it since authorities in Spain had issued an EU-wide arrest warrant for him. They want to question him in connection with allegations of money-laundering. Cherney left Russia in 1991 and is resident in Israel.\n\nDeripaska is known in the UK having been a long-time friend of Peter Mandelson and financier Nat Rothschild. He achieved notoriety in 2008 after entertaining George Osborne on his luxury yacht, thereby creating a scandal about an alleged request for a political donation to the Conservative party before the last general election.", "description": "Enigmatic settlement comes days before scheduled video testimony for \u00a31bn litigation case over 'aluminium wars'", "authors": ["Luke Harding"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/9/27/1348771621878/Oleg-Deripaska-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=aed5bddc2ae025d4e7b28917b981243f", "published_at": "2012-09-27"}
