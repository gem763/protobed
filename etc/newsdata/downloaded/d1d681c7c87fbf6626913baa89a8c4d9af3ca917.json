We have won six games bringing the car to 200 miles per hour and we will try to do it again.\u201d\n\nInter recovered from conceding early and after equalising could have gone ahead when Martinez forced Wojciech Szczesny into a great save with a powerful cross shot.\n\nBut Juve carved out the best chances with Cristiano Ronaldo denied by keeper Samir Handanovic and then had a goal ruled out for offside before the break.\n\nSarri sent on Higuain and Rodrigo Bentancur as Juve chased a winner in the second half and the changes worked wonders.\n\nJust when it was beginning to look as if the sides would have to settle for a point, Juve worked the ball forward and, after Ronaldo and Bentancur exchanged passes, Higuain was freed to slot home the winner in lethal fashion.\n\n\u201cIt was a great match for Juventus,\u201d Higuain, who replaced Federico Bernardeschi, said. \u201cInter came from six victories but we played with great character and determination and luckily we managed to bring it home.\u201d\n\nAtalanta have 16 points in third after their impressive start continued with a 3-1 home victory over Lecce.\n\nDuvan Zapata opened the scoring in the 35th minute when he punished a defensive mistake and then combined well with Alejandro Gomes who made it 2-0 before halftime.\n\nRobin Gosens added a third early in the second half.\n\nFourth-placed Napoli, on 13 points, were held 0-0 at Torino while AS Roma, fifth with 12, drew 1-1 at home to Cagliari.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Juventus ended Inter Milan\u2019s perfect record in Serie A and took over top spot as Gonzalo Higuain\u2019s superb late strike earned a 2-1 victory in the San Siro on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1174190026.jpg.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
