(Ixiana Wilmot)\n\nIn a highly competitive market like the one in metropolitan Washington, sometimes the key to reaching your goal of buying a home is compromising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re facing a bidding war that could drive up the price by thousands of dollars and your budget is limited, sometimes you\u2019ll have to scale back your expectations and make a few trade-offs to find the house that you can afford, such as:\n\n\u25cf Going for a fixer-upper instead of a turnkey house.\n\n\u25cf Living with a few features you don\u2019t love to get some that you do.\n\n\u25cf Making do with a two-bedroom instead of a three-bedroom house.\n\n\u25cf Settling for a five-block walk instead of a two-block walk to Metro.\n\n\u25cf Bypassing an established neighborhood for an up-and-coming one.\n\n\u25cf And especially giving up your desire for a red-hot neighborhood for simply a hot neighborhood.\n\n[Buying a home? These are ways to improve your credit score to make a mortgage more affordable.]\n\nWe asked Redfin to help us identify neighborhoods around the Washington area that strike a balance between popularity and affordability.\n\nRedfin scored neighborhoods based on their desirability as measured by bidding wars. Neighborhoods garnering a \u201ccompete score\u201d of 90 to 100 are likely out of reach for buyers not in a position to escalate their bids. Those with compete scores of 60 and below are neighborhoods likely lacking amenities \u2014 including easy access to Metro \u2014 that many buyers want these days.\n\nWe compiled a list of 30 Washington-area neighborhoods in the sweet spot \u2014 those ranking in the 70s and 80s. We include entry-level and move-up neighborhoods.\n\nThis may be an additional tool to help you identify neighborhoods within your budget that can give you most of what you want. By thinking outside the box and keeping an open mind, you might be able to find the right house for your family.\n\nThe list contains the name and location, median sales price and compete score of 30 communities. The median sales price includes condos, single-family houses and townhouses unless specifically noted as only condos.\n\n\n\nThe three-bedroom, three-bathroom home at 4917 Minnesota Ave. NE in Washington is listing for $495,000.
