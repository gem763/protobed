From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe mild relief that the meshuggenah-in chief has yet to wage nuclear war behoves us to reign in the doomy superlatives about the torrent of military-related dementia gushing from his every orifice this week.\n\nBut my oh bleedin\u2019 Aunt Ada, what fresh pinnacles of Mount Doolally is the tangerine kraken scaling now? Hot on the scorching heels of his self-impeaching public plea to China to help him smear the Family Biden, he is withdrawing US troops from northeast Syria \u2013 leaving the Kurdish fighters who have fought Isis on America\u2019s behalf to the tender mercies of Turkey\u2019s President Erdogan, and freeing Vladimir Putin to extend his influence there.\n\nWhen this news was met with shock even from segments of the fan base, he responded with a threat. He would, so he tautologically tweeted, \u201cdestroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if Erdogan accepted his kind invitation to invade Syria.\n\nEven some of the colon-dwelling amoebae formally known as congressional Republicans were openly horrified. If they expected the cork to be reinserted in the bottle of Chateau Cray-Cray, their optimism was short lived.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He plans to withdraw from the Open Skies treaty which enables the US and its allies to monitor Russian military activities throughout Europe, most pertinently in Ukraine.\n\nThis decision seems far too lavish a present to Putin to be explained by any previous theorising about the contents of the Kremlin safe.\n\nIf the pee-pee tapes are little more than the amuse bouche in the blackmail banquet, you wonder with nausea what the entree could possibly be.\n\nWhat Erdogan might have on Trump is a comparatively trivial matter. A photo of Donald and Ivanka posing with Erdogan in 2012, upon the opening of a Trump hotel in Turkey, has seeped into social media. While one might suspect some accounting peculiarities in that construction project, as evidence it is too circumstantial to be worth much.\n\nWhat\u2019s known for sure is that last week, towards the end of a call about unrelated matters, Erdogan casually dropped in the request that Trump pull the troops out of Syria.\n\nBut however repugnant the betrayal of the Kurds, pulling out of the Open Skies treaty represents a massive ratcheting of the threat to the world order.\n\nAny lingering claims America has to be the leader of the free world would evaporate. It would spell the end of Nato \u2013 or at the very least its suspension in cryogenic stasis.\n\nSo what, if anything, can Trump be thinking?\n\nIs he flirting with feeding Ukraine to the Russian wolf to punish its leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, for failing to lend credibility to the debunked conspiracy theory about Joe and Hunter Biden? Is it an inducement to Zelensky to get working on digging the imaginary dirt now?\n\nOr is he the victim rather than the perpetrator of a mafia shake-down? Did Moscow, fearing impeachment, put the frighteners on him to pay off Putin in full while there\u2019s time?\n\nMaybe Alex Jones of Infowars told him that marine biologists in Kiev are developing a new breed of amphibious flying killer shark fitted with radar-defying stealth-jet technology.\n\nIt could be something else, or nothing at all.\n\nAttempting logical engagement with a massively diseased mind verges on an act of lunacy itself. In all his great and unmatched wisdom, he is now so maniacally unhinged that removing him before he does damage beyond repair is all that matters.\n\nIt has been a while since there was serious talk about prising him from office on unfitness grounds, and it will be a while yet. Activating the 25th amendment relies on the willingness of the vice president, and Mike Pence\u2019s apparent collusion in the impeachable offence makes it unthinkable.\n\nThis Don, like any other capo di tutti capi, deploys mutual incrimination as a lethal weapon to enforce his made men\u2019s loyalty.\n\nThe fealty of the Republican senators who will vote on impeachment is another matter. Until now, it\u2019s been taken for granted that only when Trump is deemed a liability to their re-election chances will the invertebrates turn.\n\nBut in the last 24 hours, there has been a trickle of mutinous public hints about their hitherto private judgement concerning the mental state of President Cuckoo Bananas von Bonespurs.\n\nA man capable of tossing his country\u2019s Kurdish allies on to the bonfire of his demented vanities, let alone contemplating gifting Ukraine to his Russian controllers, must be reckoned capable of anything. And anything, as the word implies, means literally any thing.\n\nIn Nixon\u2019s last days, those who served at his pleasure were petrified by what he might do for his swansong as possessor of the codes.\n\nUnstable and paranoid as Nixon was, never in a billion light years would he have blatantly exposed himself as the asset of a hostile power.\n\nIf these senators still find the siren call of duty resistible, perhaps it would focus their minds if New Zealand\u2019s prime minister issued a declaration that no one who votes against impeaching Donald Trump will ever be given a passport.", "description": "Before we turn to the latest from the medieval bedlam moonlighting as the West Wing, a preemptive caution against hyperbole.
