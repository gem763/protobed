But the exact fate of our planet\u2019s diverse ocean dwellers at the time \u2014 shelly ammonites, giant mosasaurs and other sea creatures \u2014 has not been as well understood.\n\nNew research now makes the case that the same incident that helped bring an end to the reign of the dinosaurs also acidified the planet\u2019s oceans, disrupted the food chain that sustained life underwater and resulted in a mass extinction. The study, published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, aims to shore up the hypothesis that the Chicxulub event\u2019s destruction of marine life \u2014 the result of sulphur-rich rocks depositing acid rain into the oceans \u2014 was just as severe as the fire and fury it brought to land.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s flash acidification, and it transformed ecosystems for millions of years,\u201d said Noah Planavsky, a biogeochemist at Yale and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cWe were shocked that we actually found this.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But the connection between the crash and the marine extinction has been less solid.\n\nThat gap in understanding was on the mind of Michael Henehan, a geochemist, when he attended a conference in 2016 in the Netherlands that included a group outing to the cave system at Geulhemmerberg, which contains stones from the end of the Cretaceous period. There, he came upon a surprisingly thick rock layer made of grey clay that formed just after the asteroid hit. Lacking proper rock sample bags, he emptied the contents of his lunch into his pockets, collected some rocks and put them into his lunch bags.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In shells like these, Mr Planavsky explained, proportions of the boron isotopes shift when the acidity of the oceans rises. And because this ancient shift happened in the first 100 to 1,000 years after the impact, it means the oceans became acidic practically overnight.\n\nThe flash acidification would have devastated organisms that formed the foundations of ecosystems, leading to problems for other creatures like the ammonites that lived higher up the food chain.\n\n\u201cThis is a big leap forward,\u201d said Chris Lowery, a paleoceanographer at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the new work.\n\nThe study offers evidence of what sustained the marine extinction after the asteroid impact got things rolling. That, and it confirms that the asteroid triggered the extinction in the first place.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

For a long time, it was not clear if the marine mass extinction stemmed from changes wrought by the volcanism or by the asteroid. But because the boron shift happened exactly at the boundary, it is now obvious that the asteroid had the bigger effect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very strong evidence that the ocean acidification was caused by the impact and not volcanoes,\u201d Mr Lowery said.\n\nThe flash acidification and mass extinction, though ancient events, are relevant to our modern world. According to reports from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, human emissions of carbon dioxide are not only warming the planet, but also acidifying the oceans. And that modern acidification, Mr Planavsky says, is happening at a rate and scale comparable to the asteroid-triggered acidification. A similar result, he said, \u201cis on the extreme end of what we could get in the next 100 years.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "What happened to the dinosaurs when an asteroid about six miles wide struck Earth some 66 million years ago in what is today Mexico is well known: it wiped them out.
