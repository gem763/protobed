(Picture: Amy Brammall/ITV)\n\nNate Robinson (Jurell Carter) reveals that he is Cain Dingle\u2019s (Jeff Hordley) son is tonight\u2019s explosive episode of Emmerdale.\n\nAfter the boat explosion leaves three Emmerdale characters for dead as a result of Cain\u2019s murderous revenge plot which has dramatic consequences, the revelation from Nate adds further fuel to the fire.\n\nBut who is Nate, Cain\u2019s long lost son in Emmerdale and who is Cain\u2019s relative Nathan who was mentioned in tonight\u2019s episode?\n\nWho is Nate, Cain\u2019s son in Emmerdale?\n\nA newbie to Emmerdale earlier this year, Nate has been getting up to all sorts of trouble when it comes to coming in between Cain and his wife Moira (Natalie J Robb) and seducing various women in the Yorkshire Dales including Amy Wyatt (Natalie Ann Jamieson) and Tracy Metcalfe (Amy Walsh).\n\nNate first entered the soap over the summer as the guy Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry) had kissed on a night out in Hotten. He got a job at Butler\u2019s farm but was quickly fired when Rhona\u2019s boyfriend Pete found out the truth about her kiss with him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSubsequently Nate got a job working for Moira, which seemed to suit the hunky farmhand quite well, as it gave him a perfect excuse to meddle in the lives of Cain and Moira.\n\nNate\u2019s vendetta against Cain and intent to destroy his marriage to Moira has become more and more evident for some time and now we know it is because Nate is the Emmerdale bad boy\u2019s long lost son.\n\nWho is Nathan Dingle?\n\nNathan Dingle gets a mention in Emmerdale tonight, which is the first time he\u2019s been mentioned since 1995.\n\nHis name was last brought up when Tina Dingle mentioned that she had a brother named Nathan whilst in the Woolpack over two decades ago.\n\nNathan is the son of Zak and Nellie Dingle, counting Butch, Ben and Sam as siblings as well as Tina \u2013 making Cain and Belle his half-siblings.\n\nTina mentions in that scene from 1995 that Nathan is married and lives in London, although because he is stuck up and ashamed of his roots, his family had shunned him and not spoken to him since his wedding.\n\nNot much is known about Nathan Dingle other than that and the character has never appeared on screen in Emmerdale \u2013 at least not yet anyway.\n\nEmmerdale airs weeknights on ITV at 7pm.\n\nMORE: Emmerdale spoilers: Charity Dingle\u2019s criminal past exposed\n\nMORE: Emmerdale star Jurell Carter \u2018hurt by hate\u2019 from fans towards Nate Robinson\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Nate Robinson (Jurell Carter) revealed that he is Cain Dingle's (Jeff Hordley) son is tonight\u2019s explosive (literally) episode of Emmerdale.", "authors": ["Rachael Martin"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_78728264_1571769592.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
