This year it was Armenia\u2019s turn to be at the center of the IT world map. The consortium of ICT associations from 83 countries claims to represent 90% of the industry. Technologists, entrepreneurs, and big thinkers in tech arrived in Yerevan to explore the power of decentralization the effects of technology in our lives.\n\nHowever, this tech conference had something different up its sleeve. An eclectic mix of guests such as Kim Kardashian, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Giphy founder Alex Chung, and former System of a Down frontman Serj Tankian gathered inside Armenia\u2019s largest venue. But, it was Gary Vaynerchuck that I was able to sit down with and explore his thoughts on the digital Landscape.\n\nAudio consumption is exploding\n\nVaynerchuk passionately understands how people have a desire to do multiple things at once. We are multitasking at a level that we\u2019ve never seen before. Many of us are now listening to a podcast, watching TV, and working on our smartphones. He told me how he firmly believes that our capacity to do more is far higher than most people realize.\n\nVaynerchuk told me for these reasons alone, \u201cJoe Rogan is going to eventually sign a $100 million-plus deal to go exclusive on a platform because of the level of attention he has.\u201d Rather than just consuming podcasts, maybe it\u2019s time to take creating audio content such as podcasts seriously too.\n\nWhy we need to pay more attention to our history\n\nThere are endless examples of businesses that have steadily got further and further behind the digital curve. Despite readily admitting he was a terrible student, Vaynerchuk is quick to highlight how his love of history plays a big part in his success.\n\nLooking back throughout history helps us see that everything we are experiencing has happened before. Factories turned to machinery to increase productivity and farmers turned to tractors, it\u2019s nobodies fault it\u2019s just progress.\n\nHowever, here in 2019, it seems to be easier to demonize technology than take responsibility for our own actions. \u201cPeople used to not have traffic lights, and somebody used to get paid to help you get through intersections.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes everybody cry when they get to the airport, and they go through a machine now, not somebody who checks your passport? No, they\u2019re happy, because they don\u2019t want to wait 15 minutes.\u201d Gary went on to say that if you only care when your own job is in jeopardy, it makes you a hypocrite.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a 28-year-old truck driver, and you know that autonomous vehicles will be arriving in 20 years when you will be 48 years old. Is it an autonomous truck\u2019s fault? Or is it your fault for not creating a new skill and getting a new job?\u201d\n\nAs we enter the fourth industrial revolution and head towards web 3.0, maybe it\u2019s time to admit that it\u2019s nobodies fault and focus on accountability rather than blaming technology for everything.\n\nAn online land of opportunity\n\nBad news sells and generates more traffic for websites that are desperately trying to keep their advertisers happy. It can be difficult to see opportunities when your newsfeeds and timelines are bombarding you with scary stories painting a dystopian future after the rise of the machines.\n\nHowever, when others see a crisis, maybe we should look for hidden opportunities. Vaynerchuk told me how he believes that we\u2019ve never lived in a time where if you love sneakers, that you can build a $200,000 a year business around talking about sneakers. He also added, \u201cPeople didn\u2019t believe me ten years ago. People may think it\u2019s hard today, but they believe it can be done.\u201d\n\nFollow attention, not platforms\n\nAfter investing in Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat early on, Gary Vaynerchuk has a reputation for spotting a platform\u2019s potential before most of us have hit the create account button. Now that the regulators have Facebook in their sights, I asked him if he was still a fan of the social media behemoth.\n\nVaynerchuk advised that he is only a fan of Facebook when it\u2019s the most underpriced potential. But he is less a fan if he\u2019s trying to reach those age 40 and under. For that, he\u2019s much more of a fan of Instagram, and if 15-year-olds are your target audience, then he would opt for TikTok.\n\nThe message was clear. Gary Vaynerchuk follows attention and doesn\u2019t fall in love with any platform. The only things that matter are how and where people are consuming content today.\n\n\u201cI was a huge fan of email in 1997. I was an enormous fan of Google AdWords in 2001. I loved direct mail in 1994. I believed in television commercials. I don\u2019t believe in those things anymore. The same way I don\u2019t believe in MySpace today.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time to get serious about esports\n\nThe next LeBron James or Tom Brady might not be a sports star in the traditional sense. Kids are now looking up to guys like Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins and his gaming streams on Twitch. This is just one example of how esports is continuing to take the world by storm, and the audience figures don\u2019t lie.\n\nWhen I asked Vaynerchuk why he chose to invest in esports, he told me how the market has matured and much more organized now. \u201cIt\u2019s less of the Wild Wild West. I saw an opportunity to invest in a franchise with NFL owners in a very established market.\u201d\n\nFollow your own path\n\nGary Vaynerchuk has his fair share of critics and is very aware of why some people may think that he doesn\u2019t bring value. But he argues that his substance has been very historically correct and it\u2019s the way that he\u2019s creating awareness that really matters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that every business would like to figure out how to never come to Armenia in their lives and when they come here, many, many, many people want to talk to them. That\u2019s called a building brand. Every business and organization can learn from that.\u201d\n\nArmenia showed the world that it could talk tech and put on a show just as impactful than anything Silicon Valley has to offer. After securing some of the biggest names in tech and entertainment, every individual and business should learn to follow their own path and silence their own critics too.\n\nWhether you see crisis or opportunity on the horizon will depend entirely on your mindset. So which will you adopt and be accountable for?\n\nThis post is part of our contributor series.
