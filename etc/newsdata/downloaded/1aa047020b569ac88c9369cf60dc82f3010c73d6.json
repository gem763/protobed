Over time they will both increase and be what fuels strong net worth growth.\u201d\n\nMany of the millionaires \u201cstarted with very minimal paying jobs\u201d and worked hard to develop the skills needed to increase their salary, John said. They also diversified their income, most commonly with investment dividends, side hustles, and income-producing real estate.\n\n2. Control your spending\n\nOne of the most surprising patterns to John was that the vast majority of millionaires don\u2019t live by a budget.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean they never did.\n\n\u201cDeveloping a spending self control is vital to becoming wealthy and a budget is the best tool for doing so,\u201d John wrote. \u201cEven if it\u2019s just for the first few years of your financial journey, develop and live on a budget at least until you know you can manage your spending impulses.\u201d\n\nDespite not determining their spending for the month or year, many of the millionaires still track where their money goes, John said. The point is to save and invest as much as possible, and you achieve that by keeping expenses and discretionary spending low.\n\nOnce you\u2019re spending less than you earn, saving automatically, and investing prudently, a self-control mechanism takes over and it\u2019s no longer necessary to budget every dollar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Invest now\n\nThe maths proves that time is on your side in investing.\n\n\u201cSock away as much money as you can as early and as often as you can to get compounding working for you,\u201d John wrote.\n\nHe found that, like himself, millionaires overwhelmingly favour simple investments, like index funds. They made their fair share of mistakes early on, but most realised quickly that they aren\u2019t killer stock-pickers.\n\nIndex funds are a type of passive investment that exposes investors to a broad selection of stocks in order to diversify and ultimately minimise risk. They\u2019re low-cost and regularly outperform actively managed funds. One of the easiest ways to invest in index funds is through your retirement accounts, such as a 401(k) or IRA (superannuation in Australia).\n\n\u201cOver time you can keep at it or look to expanding into real estate depending on your goals and interests,\u201d John wrote. \u201cAfter that, it\u2019s simply time. Give it long enough and one day you wake up wealthy.\u201d\n\nThis story first appeared in Business Insider.
