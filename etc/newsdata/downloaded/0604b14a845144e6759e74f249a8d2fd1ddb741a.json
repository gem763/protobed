Maybe in the grand scheme of things,\u201d Hunter Biden said in an ABC News interview that aired on Tuesday. \u201cBut did I make a mistake based on some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden is a front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest, and the interview with his son aired hours before the fourth Democratic presidential debate.\n\nHunter Biden said he did not discuss his foreign business dealings with his father. He served on the board of an energy company in Ukraine, a fact he said his father learned from press reports.\n\nThe younger Biden was a lawyer at a top Washington law firm with expertise in corporate governance. But he acknowledged on Tuesday that he probably would not have been asked to serve on the board if not for his name.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies have targeted Hunter Biden for his work in Ukraine and China, making baseless claims of corruption.\n\nTrump\u2019s July 25 phone call pressuring Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate the Bidens is the focus of a whistleblower complaint that triggered the formal House impeachment inquiry into Trump. Trump has denied wrongdoing.\n\nHours after Hunter Biden\u2019s interview aired, Trump said in a tweet that the former vice president\u2019s son was \u201creally bad\u201d in the ABC interview and that \u201cSleepy Joe has real problems.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden recently said he would step down from the board of directors of a Chinese-backed private equity firm because his service had become a \u201cdistraction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I have committed that I won\u2019t serve on any board or work on any foreign entities when Dad becomes president,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the rule I\u2019m going to adhere to.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden said on Sunday that if he\u2019s elected: \u201cNo one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in meetings as if they\u2019re a Cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationships with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or foreign country.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement \u201cHunter was forceful and spoke with conviction,\u201d and after \u201can unprecedented smear campaign by the president of the United States, who is engulfed in a scandal of his own making.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, then Vice President Joe Biden was at the forefront of American diplomatic efforts to support Ukraine\u2019s fragile democratic government as it sought to fend off Russian aggression and root out corruption. President Barack Obama\u2019s White House said there was no conflict with Hunter Biden\u2019s work for a Ukrainian gas company because the younger Biden was a private citizen.\n\nBesides Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call to Ukraine\u2019s leader pressing for investigations, Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, began reaching out to Ukraine\u2019s president and his aides to press for a government investigation into the company, Burisma, and Hunter Biden\u2019s role.\n\nHunter Biden blamed his father\u2019s political opponents, including Trump, for spreading a \u201cridiculous conspiracy theory.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That\u2019s where I made the mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing the subject of Donald Trump\u2019s ire is a feather in my cap,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I go to bed nervous about at night at all. The reason I\u2019m able to do that is because I am absolutely enveloped in love of my family.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has relentlessly mocked Hunter Biden, to the point that his presidential campaign began selling shirts that say, \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d highlighting that the former vice president\u2019s son had been out of the public spotlight for weeks. At a recent political rally, Trump noted that Hunter Biden had been thrown out of the Navy.\n\nHunter Biden was discharged from the Navy Reserve in 2014 after failing a drug test and has struggled with alcohol and drug abuse. He told ABC News that, \u201clike every single person that I\u2019ve ever known, I have fallen and I\u2019ve gotten up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done esteemable things and things that are \u2014 have been in my life that I regret. Every single one of those things has brought me exactly to where I am right now, which is probably the best place I\u2019ve ever been in my life. I\u2019ve gone through my own struggles.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hunter Biden, acknowledging that his family name created business opportunities, rejected assertions by President Donald Trump that he", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/a4ebb7_presidential-families-35833-in-jan-30-2010-file-photo-vice-president-joe-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
