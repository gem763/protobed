The pound fell.\n\nAccording to a British official, Merkel told Prime Minister Boris Johnson that Northern Ireland must remain part of the European Union\u2019s customs union if he wants to secure a divorce agreement. Johnson responded by saying that condition, together with the EU\u2019s unwillingness to engage with his latest proposals, paved the way to a no-deal Brexit.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk hit back.\n\nThe sniping is more evidence that the U.K. and EU could fail to strike a deal ahead of next week\u2019s summit.\n\nWithout that, Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the EU by the month\u2019s end. But, under the Benn Act, he also is required to seek an extension if he doesn\u2019t have a deal by Oct. 19 -- something that may still force him to seek a delay and hold a general election before going back to Brussels again.\n\nEU officials privately believe the British government\u2019s strategy is to pin responsibility for a delay or no-deal Brexit onto them. The bloc has signaled it is willing to permit an extension, seeing a general election as a likely consequence.\n\nThe turmoil helped send the pound to the lowest level in a month against the euro on Tuesday.\n\nThe EU has always argued that Northern Ireland must remain inside the European customs union in order to ensure there are no physical checks on goods crossing the land border with Ireland. The British government has long insisted Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union along with the rest of the U.K., to avoid splitting off the region into a different economic zone from mainland Britain.\n\nLate on Monday night, an 800-word text message attributed to someone in Johnson\u2019s office was published on the Spectator magazine\u2019s website, blaming the EU\u2019s refusal to move on the Irish question for the imminent collapse of the talks. The author accepted that an extension was likely, and that Johnson would fight an election promising a no-deal Brexit immediately if he won.\n\nJames Slack, a U.K. government spokesman, described the conversation between Johnson and Merkel as a \u201cfrank exchange\u201d and denied Tusk\u2019s characterization.\n\nHe said it was unacceptable for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and that Johnson had told Merkel that the U.K. had made a significant offer and that it was time for the EU compromise. Slack also said that the U.K. hasn\u2019t asked an EU member state to use its veto power to block another delay to Brexit day later this month.\n\nGerman officials disputed the British account of the call, while others in Europe found it difficult to believe that the typically cautious Merkel would have expressed herself so strongly. Nevertheless, relations were strained by the encounter.\n\nOne German official said Merkel was well aware of the blame game Johnson\u2019s office has started, but did not intend to join in trading blows in public.\n\nAfter the call, Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which supports Johnson\u2019s Brexit stance, said accepting the EU\u2019s position would amount to \u201csurrender.\u201d\n\nHours later, the U.K. government published a report on its preparations for a no-deal exit. Such an outcome could cause shortages of some fruit and vegetables, force drugmakers to stockpile medicines, and require the government to deploy a reserve fleet of 80 oil tankers to maintain fuel supplies.\n\nRead more: Boris Johnson Plays a Shameless Game With Merkel: Lionel Laurent\n\n--With assistance from Tim Ross, Patrick Donahue, Arne Delfs, Helene Fouquet, Jasmina Kuzmanovic, Andra Timu, Dara Doyle and John Follain.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ian Wishart in Brussels at iwishart@bloomberg.net;Alex Morales in London at amorales2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Edward Evans, Flavia Krause-Jackson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0sign up to our Brexit Bulletin.\u00a0The blame game over the likely failure to reach a Brexit deal escalated, with the U.K. accusing German Chancellor Angela Merkel of making an agreement effectively impossible.
