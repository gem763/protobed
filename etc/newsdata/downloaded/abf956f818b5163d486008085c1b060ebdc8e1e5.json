House speaker in fight in redrawn district", "language": "en", "text": "Bynum-Coleman, the daughter of a former Richmond police officer, was clear in the interview that she wants police at schools to ensure safety but doesn\u2019t think they should handle minor disciplinary matters.\n\nThe ad represents a departure from Cox\u2019s mostly upbeat messaging, suggesting that the speaker is feeling pressure from his underdog challenger in a pivotal election year, with all 140 House and Senate seats on the ballot and Republicans defending razor-thin majorities in both chambers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCox is running for a seat he has held for a generation but he\u2019s in unfamiliar territory: As a remedy to racial gerrymandering, a federal court ordered more than two dozen House districts redrawn. The speaker\u2019s district, a suburban-rural mix just south of Richmond, became significantly less white and less Republican.\n\n\u201cThe court-ordered redesign of the district has created a greater threat to his reelection than he\u2019s faced in many years,\u201d said Stephen J. Farnsworth, a University of Mary Washington political scientist. \u201cAnd this is how many incumbent politicians respond to increased threats. . . . Context is the first casualty of October. As the election draws near, people look for sound bites or sometimes sound half-bites that can be of use.\u201d\n\nBynum-Coleman\u2019s campaign manager, Rob Silverstein, said the ad misrepresents the challenger\u2019s position in \u201can attempt to stoke fear among the residents of the 66th District.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy father was a Richmond City police officer and I am a mom with kids in public schools, so the safety of our communities, and particularly of our children, is my top priority,\u201d Bynum-Coleman said in a written statement. \u201cAs I said in the actual clip, when police are in our schools, they should be able to focus on safety and not on disciplining our children, which too often disproportionately affects students of color and leads to a school-to-prison pipeline.\u201d\n\nCox\u2019s campaign stood by the ad, which quotes one sentence from an interview Bynum-Coleman gave on an Internet radio show in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to be a misrepresentation of Ms. Bynum-Coleman, when the ad uses a recording of her own words,\u201d Cox spokesman Parker Slaybaugh said in a written message.\n\nAD\n\nRoles were reversed last month, when Cox\u2019s campaign said Bynum-Coleman misrepresented his position on teacher raises in one of her ads. PolitiFact gave its worst rating \u2014 \u201cPants on Fire\u201d \u2014 to her commercial.\n\nAD\n\nAs the state\u2019s most powerful Republican, Cox (Colonial Heights) has mostly used a soft sell to introduce himself in his revamped district south of Richmond. The retired teacher and baseball coach wooed voters with moon bounces and outdoor movie nights during the summer, and aired feel-good biographical commercials, including a 60-second cinematic ode to his time as \u201cCoach Cox.\u201d\n\nThe new TV ad strikes an entirely different tone. It opens with an image of Bynum-Coleman, combined with a short clip of audio from an interview she gave to a program called \u201cReasonable Voices.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn extended remarks in the interview, Bynum-Coleman said she was concerned that police were being used to enforce minor infractions at schools, a practice that she says feeds the school-to-prison pipeline. But she also expressed a need to have police at schools for safety reasons.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want children getting into fights, we don\u2019t want them walking into class late, we don\u2019t want them being disruptive in the classrooms, but do we want to send them to prison?\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cI think there\u2019s an alternative here, and I think that we need to get the police out of the schools. The police need to be there for safety measures and to make sure the school is safe, not to incarcerate children and deal with disciplinary actions. And that\u2019s what\u2019s taking place, and so the school-to-prison pipeline is exploding.\u201d\n\nCox\u2019s TV ad quotes only one line from the interview \u2014 \u201cWe need to get the police out of the schools\u201d \u2014 playing the audio, then flashing those words several times on the screen. A group of mothers \u2014 \u201cReal moms. Not actors\u201d \u2014 are shown sitting around a table, clutching coffee cups and fretting about the prospect of unpoliced schools.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s scary,\u201d one says. \u201cI don\u2019t want my kids in an environment where they\u2019re not going to be safe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re community helpers. They\u2019re heroes. They\u2019re good people,\u201d another says.\n\nA third pipes up: \u201cThey\u2019re there as an added layer of protection.\u201d\n\nA fourth: \u201cI just want my daughter to be safe.\u201d\n\nThe first mom sums things up: \u201cAs a mom, I just wouldn\u2019t vote for Sheila Bynum-Coleman. I just wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hardly uncommon for political messaging to go negative as Election Day nears.\n\n\u201cThe sweetness of summer is moon bounces and hot dogs,\u201d Farnsworth said. \u201cThe gritty reality of fall is the attack ad.\u201d\n\nLast month, Bynum-Coleman aired an ad claiming that \u201cCox joined special interests to deny teachers raises.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne of the votes cited to support that claim was a 2013 vote against the budget \u2014 cast by another Cox, then-Del. John Cox (R-Hanover). Kirk Cox voted for the budget.\n\nThe campaign came up with new citations to back the claim, but PolitiFact still found them wanting. Since 2005, Cox voted for seven budgets that raised teacher salaries and voted twice to cancel the raises because of lagging state revenue, PolitiFact found. It said there was no proof that \u201cspecial interests\u201d were behind his votes to rescind the raises.\n\nAD\n\nBynum-Coleman, a real estate agent, has never held elective office. In 2017, amid backlash against President Trump\u2019s election, she came close to unseating veteran Del. Riley E. Ingram (R-Hopewell) in an adjacent district. The new maps placed her in Cox\u2019s district for this year\u2019s race.\n\nAD\n\nThe redrawn district swung from favoring Republicans by 26 points to tilting toward Democrats by six, from 76 percent white to 58 percent, and from 18 percent black to 34 percent, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project.\n\nMany independent political observers say defeating the speaker remains a tall order. But a competitive race will force Cox to spend time and money that otherwise could go to other Republicans.\n\nBynum-Coleman raised $470,000 from January through Aug. 31, with $341,000 on hand heading into September. Cox raised $1.2 million over the same period and had $590,000 in the bank.\n\nAD", "description": "Republican Kirk Cox appears to be feeling pressure from Democrat Sheila Bynum-Coleman.", "authors": ["Laura Vozzella", "Local Reporter Covering Virginia Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MM0oHpRypuHLxfHzFcYvie9Ea4M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y3E7F3FVDQI6TLGIDWCHXLGKOM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
