Here are seven things you need to know about the fearless and passionate 16-year-old.\n\nAt just 16, Sweden's Greta Thunberg has already taken on two problematic factors troubling the globe: impending ecological collapse and US President, Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nYou may recognise the teen from her recent gut-punching speech at the UN Climate Action Summit, one which Mr Trump found fit to mock.\n\nWatch speech below or on YouTube :\n\nIn all-too-typical Trump fashion, the world leader took to Twitter to troll the Swedish teen.\n\n\"She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\" He wrote, for which he has since received intense backlash on the platform.\n\nBut instead of being offended by the president's diss, the teen simply updated her bio with the shady Tweet.\n\n\n\n\n\nHas the Twitter sparring king finally picked on someone his own size?\n\nGiven that she's single-handedly managed to mobilise teens across the world to not only take an interest in an issue impacting their future but to also do something about it, the young girl is definitely one to watch.\n\nHere are 7 things you need to know about the teen taking on giants\n\n\n\nShe skipped school to start a revolution\n\nIt's been a little over a year since Greta began her efforts to raise awareness on climate change.\n\nInspired by what she learned in school about ecological collapse, as well as the protests held by Parkland teen gun activists in the US, the then 15-year-old Greta started skipping school to picket outside the Swedish Parliament.\n\nThis was the start of what has now become the Fridays For Future movement, a fully-fledged organisation operating in 30 countries all consisting of teen activist who regularly\n\nShe has a \"superpower\"\n\nGreta learned about global warming at the age of 8, and became incredibly depressed as a result.\n\nAt 11, she was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and selective mutism.\n\nLabelling the disorders the source of her \"superpower,\" the teen says she probably would not be as tell-it-like-it-is otherwise.\n\nHer parents weren't always supportive of her activism\n\nWhen she was asked to speak at the 2018 People's Climate March, Greta's parents were concerned that due to her selective mutism, she would not be able to address the crowd.\n\nThanks to her drive, the teen managed to convince them to that she could do it.\n\nGreta has since said that having the condition means she only speaks \"when I think it's necessary. Now is one of those moments.\"\n\nHer mom and dad are entertainers\n\nGreta is the child of Malenda Ernman, an opera singer and Svante Thunberg, an author, producer, and actor.\n\nThe family have come a long way since their apprehension about Greta's activism, and along with their younger daughter, Beata, have co-written a book titled Scenes from the Heart.\n\nThe family's forthcoming title Our House Is on Fire: Scenes of a Family and a Planet in Crisis is set to published next year.\n\nShe never travels by plane\n\nThe teen has been vocal about her no-fly policy, preferring to travel by boat instead. During a recent appearance on the Daily Show, she explained this is due to \"the enormous impact aviation has on the climate.\"\n\nShe writes her own speeches\n\nFew people have the ability to deliver the kind of gut-punching speeches that seem to come so naturally to the 16-year-old, and she's previously confirmed the words are her own.\n\n\"There is no one 'behind' me except for myself... And yes, I write my own speeches. But since I know that what I say is going to reach many, many people I often ask for input,\" she commented in a Facebook post addressing rumours that her speeches are not her own.\n\nShe's made the Time 100 list and is in the running for a Nobel Peace Prize\n\nThe ability to make the world sit up, listen and act is an ability few can claim, so it's easy to see why Greta has made Time's Magazine's most influential people of 2019 list.\n\nThe teen has also been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nA bright spark in a sometimes dark world, if anything Greta gives us hope that future generations are in good hands.\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
