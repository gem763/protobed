Kids of poor immigrants rise no matter where they come from", "language": "en", "text": "Children of poor immigrants rise no matter where they come from and have higher rates of upward mobility than US born peers, according to a new study.\n\nThe report by Princeton, Stanford and the University of California, Davis, shows how immigrants today are no slower to move into the middle class than immigrants from 100 years ago.\n\nUsing millions of father-son pairs from the poorest quartile across three different time periods, academics say they have shown how both now, and in the past, immigrants may not earn as much as US born workers but their children do.\n\nAnd it also shows how the sons of Indian and Chinese immigrants now fair the best after coming to the US, compared to those from Ireland and Italy 100 years ago.\n\nThe report notes: 'No matter when their parents came to the U.S. or what country they came from, children of immigrants have higher rates of upward mobility than their U.S.-born peers.\n\n'What\u2019s more, their rates of mobility today are strikingly similar to rates of mobility in the past.'\n\nIn fact, those born to poor Mexican and Dominican legal immigrants now are able to reach the same relative economic success as those born to poor immigrants from Finland or Scotland a hundred years ago the study claims.\n\nAnd in both eras these children have done better than those born to US natives.\n\nChildren of poor immigrants rise no matter where they come from and have higher rates of upward mobility than US born peers, according to a new study. The report by Princeton, Stanford and the University of California , Davis, shows how immigrants observed from 1980 to 2015 are no slower to move into the middle class than immigrants from 100 years ago\n\nUsing millions of father-son pairs across three different time periods (those observed between 1910 and 1940 pictured here) academics say they have shown how both now, and in the past, immigrants may not earn as much as US born workers but their children do\n\nTrump said in August he was considering issuing an executive order to get rid of the longstanding measure that guarantees citizenship to those born within the borders of the U.S.\n\nHis biggest campaign promise was to crack down on illegal immigration and build a wall to stop people from unlawfully crossing the border and living off of U.S. benefits. He also said during the 2016 campaign that he would do away with birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants.\n\nWHAT THE CHARTS SHOW The charts used in this report show the average income rank for children born to 25th percentile, the lowest quartile, by father\u2019s birthplace. These graphs highlight how the average boy in that group will go on to make more money than his parents. And the sons of immigrants will climb that ladder higher than those born to US native dads. The patterns continues over a hundred year period. It is important to note the data for America compares only white boys for the 1880 and 1910 census.\n\nThe administration also announced a new 'public charge' rule that would allow the government to deny entry to individuals it felt would likely end up relying on Medicaid, food stamps or other public benefits.\n\nBut Ran Abramitzky, a professor at Stanford and one of the paper\u2019s authors, said: 'The short-term perspective on immigrant assimilation that politicians tend to take might underestimate the long-run success of immigrants.\n\n'By the second generation, they are doing quite well.'\n\nIn January 2018 Trump again made headlines when he lashed out in a meeting with lawmakers about immigration reform, demanding to know why the US should accept citizens from what he called 's**thole' countries.\n\nHe was speaking about people from Haiti, El Salvador and various African nations, people briefed on the meeting told the Washington Post.\n\nTrump then suggested the US should welcome immigrants from places like Norway.\n\nBut this study shows that in fact Norwegians have been shown to be among the least successful after they arrived.\n\nImmigrants to the USA landing at Ellis Island, New York circa 1900. A report by Princeton, Stanford and the University of California, Davis, shows how immigrants today are no slower to move into the middle class than immigrants from 100 years ago\n\nMigrants are brought to a processing center after crossing the international border between the United States and Mexico in March 2019. Those born to poor Mexican and Dominican legal immigrants are able to reach the same relative economic success as those born to poor immigrants from Finland or Scotland a hundred years ago the study claims\n\nCrucially for those born at the bottom of the income distribution the gap in mobility rates is much bigger, the reports authors say.\n\nComparing three groups, from the 1880 and 1910 censuses and data from legal immigrants who first came to the U.S. around 1980, the study shows how 'children of first-generation immigrants growing up in the poorest 25 percent of the distribution end up near the middle as adults'.\n\nThe study adds: 'These children of immigrants have rates of economic mobility that are 3\u20136 percentage points higher than their U.S. born peers.\n\n'For those in the top quarter of the income distribution, the gap in mobility is about 1-5 percentage points.'\n\nThe authors conclude: 'Our research suggests that politicians crafting immigration policy shouldn\u2019t be so short-sighted.\n\n'Even immigrants who come to the U.S. with few resources or skills bring something that\u2019s hugely beneficial to the U.S. economy: their children.\n\n'Most importantly, our research suggests there\u2019s room to be optimistic about the American Dream. For millions of families, coming to America can and does improve their children\u2019s opportunities.'", "description": "The study showed a comparison in mobility between those born to poor Mexican and Dominican immigrants now and those from\u00a0Finland or Scotland 100 years ago.", "authors": ["Lauren Fruen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/21/20348466-0-image-a-114_1572385358283.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
