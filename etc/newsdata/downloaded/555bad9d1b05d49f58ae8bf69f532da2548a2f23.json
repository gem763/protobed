Mandatory Credit: Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports\n\nOne day removed from a victory at Chicago, the Los Angeles Chargers fired offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis is not an easy decision and definitely not one that I take lightly,\u201d Chargers coach Anthony Lynn said in a statement. \u201cYou win as a team, and you lose as a team. It\u2019s never about just one person. At the end of the day, however, I simply felt a change was needed at this time.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Ken for his years of service to the Chargers organization and wish him nothing but the best moving forward.\u201d\n\nThe Chargers (3-5) have struggled to run the ball in historic fashion this season, a fact that even the 17-16 victory over the Bears could not hide. In rushing for 36 yards Sunday, the Chargers became the first team in the Super Bowl era to rush for fewer than 40 yards for four straight games.\n\nAnd that\u2019s with running back Melvin Gordon in the backfield. Gordon missed the season\u2019s first four games holding out.\n\nLynn did not name an immediate replacement for Whisenhunt, who served as the Chargers\u2019 offensive coordinator in 2013, then left to be the head coach at Tennessee for two seasons before returning to the Chargers for the 2016 season.\n\nWhisenhunt, 57, has a 48-71 career record as a head coach including stints with the Cardinals (2007-12) and the Titans. He led Arizona to the Super Bowl after the 2008 season.\n\nA season removed from going 12-4 and winning a playoff game, the Chargers are two games behind the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC West.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "One day removed from a victory at Chicago, the Los Angeles Chargers fired offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446056119&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S06A-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
