Sixteen countries attended this summit which included 10 ASEAN countries and six trade partners (China, Korea, India, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, etc.).\n\nIndia indeed has a large trade deficit with China which stood at $57.86 billion in 2018, and that has widened from $51.72 billion in 2017. Comparatively, India\u2019s overall was $187 billion in 2018. This shows that China accounts for about one-third of the total trade deficit that India has on a global level.\n\nThe summit was held to negotiate over the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in which there would be a call for lowering tariffs among nations. However, further lowering of tariffs on the products that India imports from China would mean that there would be a flood of goods from China. This scenario will worsen the already vast trade deficit that India holds with China. It will be interesting to understand if India indeed accepts the RCEP agreement.\n\nSo what are the reasons why India is having such a huge trade deficit and what are the implications of it?\n\nIndia imports several goods from China that includes textiles, metals, dairy, chemicals, electronics, etc. On a global level, India meets 80% of its needs through Imports. is another product that India imports. In July alone, India\u2019s imports of Crude Oil and Gold stood at $9.60 billion and $1.71 billion respectively.\n\nThe reason why a ballooning trade deficit hurts India is the widening of (CAD). Lowering of CAD allows the government to spend money on other development activities, which is imperative for boosting economic growth. This explains why Jaishankar is rightly concerned about India\u2019s growing trade deficit with China.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Investing.com (Puneet Sikka/Investing.com) covering: XAU/USD, Gold Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
