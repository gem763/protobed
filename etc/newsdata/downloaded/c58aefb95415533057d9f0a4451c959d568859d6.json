In our view, the better-than-expected revenue displays Alphabet\u2019s network effect economic moat source as the firm\u2019s growing ecosystem keeps increasing the usage of its products and services, attracting advertisers and creating further monetization opportunities. Search remained one of the main top line growth drivers as the firm has again enhanced its search offering. The firm\u2019s quarterly results also supported our view that its cloud business may grow impressively while it diversifies Google\u2019s overall revenue. We have not made material changes to our model and are maintaining our $1,300 per share fair value estimate for Alphabet. While this wide-moat name remains a 3-star stock, we believe it becomes attractive on any pullback.\n\nTotal third-quarter revenue came in at $40.5 billion, up 20% from last year. Since the firm\u2019s first-quarter revenue miss (with respect to the S&P Capital IQ consensus at the time), it appears that Google is back on track attracting advertisers and users, and comfortably selling its ad inventory, as we anticipated at the time. Advertising revenue increased 17% year over year, as ads sold on the firm\u2019s owned and operated properties, such as YouTube, continued to grow. In addition, further usage of Google\u2019s search, whether on mobile devices or desktops, kept attracting advertisers. The company has improved its search capabilities with further investment in machine learning focusing on natural language processing which helps better interpret a user\u2019s questions or phrases. Google is also trying to further monetize users by providing additional relevant content on the search site to keep users engaged. The firm refers to this as Google Discover (formerly Google Feed).", "description": "Shares of the wide-moat firm are fairly valued today, and we believe it becomes attractive on any pullback.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/bltf5c9f6de4daaa773/5cb4f480fe8386be234ac8fb/QuarterEndReview_Sectors_Bars_1x1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
