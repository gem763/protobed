The mass adoption of smartphones has made the government\u2019s job much easier, allowing for universal 24-hour surveillance.\n\n\u201cAll this information that used to be ephemeral\u2026now, these things are stored. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re doing anything wrong,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cThat\u2019s how bulk collection - the government\u2019s euphemism for mass surveillance - works. They simply collect it all in advance in the hope that it will one day become useful.\u201d\n\nGoogle Street View cars, wireless access points, and seemingly-innocent apps are all tools of surveillance, he continued, explaining that \u201cthere\u2019s an industry that is built on keeping [bulk data collection and surveillance] invisible.\u201d Smartphone users, Snowden said, need to demand the right to control what their devices actually do - if we could see what was going on at any given time, we\u2019d be horrified.\n\n\u201cIf there was a button on your phone that said \u2018Do what I want, but not spy on me,\u2019 you would press that button, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately Google and Apple\u2026neither of them allow that button to exist. In fact, they actively interfere with it, because they say it\u2019s a security risk,\u201d Snowden continued, lamenting that the devices\u2019 complexity has rendered them vulnerable to exploitation by government spies. The constant, desensitizing flood of stories about data manipulation \u201chappens as a result of a single problem - an inequality of available information. They can see everything about you, they can see everything about what your device is doing, and they can do whatever they want with your device.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou on the other hand\u2026you paid for the device, but increasingly these corporations own it. Increasingly, these governments own it.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com What Fourth Amendment? Court ruling says FBI snooped on private data of MILLIONS of Americans\n\nThat inequality is at the heart of the problem of government surveillance, Snowden believes. In the stifling climate of fear that descended following 9/11, \u201cwe had lost our seat at the table of government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were no longer partnered with the government, we had simply become subjects of the government.\u201d\n\nSnowden blames that fear for the rise of Trump, explaining, \u201cWhen we become fearful, we become vulnerable to anyone who promises they will make things better - even if they have no ability to make things better, even if they will actively make things worse even if they will make things better for themselves and their buddies by taking from you.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump - along with every president that comes after him - has access to the same monstrous system of \u201cturnkey tyranny\u201d constructed in secrecy by then-Vice President Dick Cheney and his lawyer David Attington almost two decades ago. Presidents are given a good \u201cfearing-up\u201d - given an inflated idea of the threats facing them - and they invariably succumb to the demands of the intelligence agencies. Those who don\u2019t are mercilessly tormented by them, as Trump is quickly learning. Either way, the intelligence agencies continue slurping up secrets with impunity.\n\n\u201cThe scandal isn\u2019t that they\u2019re breaking the law - the scandal is that they don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Whoa,\u2019 tweets Snowden, as Bernie Sanders says he would not prosecute government whistleblowers under Espionage Act\n\nStellarwind, the surveillance program Snowden revealed to the world back in 2013, was crafted in such secrecy that just eight members of Congress knew about it. The two congressmen who objected were reduced to \u201csort of doing these weird Lassie barks to the press\u201d - trying to tip journalists off to the existence of the program without leaking classified information - but no mainstream media outlet would take the bait.\n\nSnowden would like to come home someday, but he doubts he\u2019ll never get a fair trial. Threatened with prosecution under the Espionage Act - \u201ca law the government exclusively uses against people who tell the truth\u201d - he does not believe he\u2019s safe, even in Russia, where he lives in exile. But safety is not exactly a priority - if it was, he\u2019d still be getting paid to spy on Americans.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to eliminate all risks from you\u2019re life, what you\u2019re actually doing is eliminating all possibility from your life. if you\u2019re trying to collapse the universe of outcomes, you\u2019ve actually lost the ability to act because you\u2019re afraid, and that\u2019s what got us into this mess.\u201d\n\nLike this story?
