Harris, like many Democratic lawmakers, is calling for an impeachment inquiry of President Trump. But her Twitter account and her presidential campaign have issued a second call to action in recent days: Suspend Trump\u2019s @realDonaldTrump account from Twitter.\n\nLook let's be honest, @realDonaldTrump's Twitter account should be suspended. \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 1, 2019\n\nIn a letter sent to Twitter on Tuesday, Harris\u2019s presidential campaign asked Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey to suspend Trump for violating the site\u2019s rules against \u201ctargeted harassment.\u201d The Harris camp says that multiple recent tweets from the president were meant to \u201ctarget, harass, and attempt to out the whistleblower\u201d who has alleged that the president pressed Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n[Live updates: House Democrats to subpoena White House for documents in its impeachment inquiry focused on Ukraine]\n\nThe California senator and her campaign have singled out a few tweets that they believe break Twitter\u2019s rules. Here they are:\n\nSounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn\u2019t a Whistleblower at all. In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019\n\nLike every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \u201cWhistleblower,\u201d represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way. Then Schiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2019\n\nHarris\u2019s letter also pointed to Trump tweets promising \u201cBig Consequences\u201d to anyone who provided information to the whistleblower and questioning whether House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who is leading the investigation against Trump, should be arrested for \u201ctreason.\u201d And Trump\u2019s tweet quoting the Rev. Robert Jeffress that invoked the idea of a \u201ccivil war\u201d if he\u2019s removed from office.\n\nIf @realDonaldTrump were a normal Twitter account run by a random person, Twitter would evaluate these tweets for potential violations. If the company then determined that the tweets were breaking their rules, it would either temporarily lock Trump\u2019s account (and ask him to delete the offending tweets) or suspend the account.\n\nBut @realDonaldTrump is not a normal account, and over the years, Twitter has established a few loopholes that protect him from having to play by the rules. Below is a guide to those loopholes, how they\u2019ve applied in the past, and how they might apply to Trump\u2019s recent tweets.\n\nA rule loophole for \u201cmilitary or government entities\u201d\n\nTwitter announced in late 2017 that it would begin enforcing new rules designed to stem hateful and abusive content. Twitter bans \u201cspecific threats of violence or wishing for serious physical harm, death, or disease to an individual or group of people.\u201d\n\nThe Harris campaign suggested that Trump\u2019s civil war and \u201cArrest for Treason?\u201d tweets were \u201cblatant threats.\u201d In the past, some have also argued that Trump violated that policy when he tweeted about his \u201cNuclear Button,\u201d or how North Korea \u201cwon\u2019t be around much longer\u201d or ... this\n\nTo Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2018\n\nBut in the section of Twitter\u2019s rules that bans \u201caccounts that affiliate with organizations that use or promote violence against civilians,\u201d the company has created an exemption for \u201cmilitary or government entities.\u201d\n\nThe president of the United States would certainly qualify.\n\nIn January 2018, a few days after Trump tweeted about the size of his nuclear button, Twitter outlined how it approaches enforcing its rules against world leaders.\n\n\u201cTwitter is here to serve and help advance the global, public conversation,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post. \u201cElected world leaders play a critical role in that conversation because of their outsized impact on our society. Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate. It would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions.\u201d\n\n[Twitter adds labels for tweets that break its rules \u2014 a move with potentially stark implications for Trump\u2019s account]\n\nTwitter has since tweaked how it handles some rule-breaking tweets in this category. The company announced that it would begin flagging tweets by national political figures with more than 100,000 followers that violate its policies.\n\nAs my colleagues Tony Romm and Elizabeth Dwoskin wrote in June, flagged tweets would require users to click on a screen that carries a warning message: \u201cThe Twitter Rules about abusive behavior apply to this Tweet. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public\u2019s interest for the Tweet to remain available.\u201d Flagged tweets would also circulate to fewer people in Twitter\u2019s algorithms and search.\n\nTwitter confirmed that, to date, it has yet to apply its public interest notice to a rule-breaking tweet.\n\n\u201cNewsworthiness\u201d\n\nTrump tweeted two years ago that North Korea \u201cwon\u2019t be around much longer\u201d if it doesn\u2019t change its tune toward the United States, prompting calls to ban Trump for violating Twitter\u2019s rules against physical threats.\n\nJust heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017\n\nTwitter defended its decision to keep the tweet and Trump\u2019s account online, saying that the platform considered \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d as a factor while examining potential rule violations.\n\n\u201cWe hold all accounts to the same Rules, and consider a number of factors when assessing whether Tweets violate our Rules,\u201d Twitter\u2019s public policy account wrote in a statement. \u201cAmong the considerations is \u2018newsworthiness\u2019 and whether a Tweet is of public interest. This has long been internal policy and we\u2019ll soon update our public-facing rules to reflect it. We need to do better on this.\u201d\n\n[The one word that lets politicians get away with breaking the rules on social media]\n\nOther platforms have used \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d as a factor that limits its enforcement of the rules against major politicians. Last week, Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global affairs, cited Facebook\u2019s newsworthiness exception in outlining why the company will keep most rule-breaking content from politicians on the site.\n\n\u201cIt is not our role to intervene when politicians speak,\u201d Clegg said. \u201cWe do not submit speech by politicians to our independent fact-checkers, and we generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules.\u201d\n\nTwitter\u2019s \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d exemption doesn\u2019t necessarily protect every piece of content the president touches. In July, when the president retweeted a conspiracy-theory-laden account claiming that \u201cDemocrats are the true enemies of America,\u201d Twitter suspended that account, causing the tweet to disappear from Trump\u2019s otherwise newsworthy timeline.\n\nThe rules themselves\n\nTwitter has done a lot of work over the past couple of years to clarify its rules and how they are enforced, but the company still leaves itself room to interpret the rules as it wants in any given situation. And that gives Trump a third loophole \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t just apply to the president. Twitter could determine that something he tweeted doesn\u2019t violate its rules.\n\nThis is a kind of flexibility social-media companies tend to afford themselves. Reddit chief executive Steve Huffman once alluded to the \u201cspecifically vague\u201d approach to writing rules for social platforms. The argument is that sites should always have the leeway to interpret their own rules as needed, because if the rules are too specific, bad actors will be able to get off on a technicalities.\n\nTwitter doesn\u2019t believe that Trump\u2019s tweet about the size and effectiveness of the president\u2019s \u201cNuclear Button\u201d broke its rules. In a statement at the time to Business Insider, Twitter said the tweet was not a \u201cspecific threat\u201d and therefore wasn\u2019t banned under the company\u2019s rule against \u201cspecific threats of violence or wishing for serious physical harm, death, or disease to an individual or group of people.\u201d\n\nTwitter declined to comment to The Washington Post on whether the tweets flagged by Harris violate the platform\u2019s rules. But the company acknowledged having received her campaign\u2019s letter and said it intends to respond.\n\nMore reading:\n\nPlaying \u2018Untitled Goose Game\u2019 is the new punching a wall\n\nThe dangerous cycle that keeps conspiracy theories in the news \u2014 and Trump\u2019s tweets\n\nWill taking down 8chan stop the worst people on the Internet?", "description": "Harris's campaign accused Trump of issuing \"blatant threats\" on Twitter.
