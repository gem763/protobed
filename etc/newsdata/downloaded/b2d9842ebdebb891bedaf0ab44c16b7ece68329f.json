The letter states:\n\n\u201cAmong other things, we do not believe that current purchasers of Bitcoin are relying on the essential managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of others to produce a profit. Accordingly, because Cipher intends to invest substantially all of its assets in Bitcoin as currently structured, it does not meet the definition of an \u2018investment company\u2019 under the Investment Company Act and it has inappropriately filed on Form N-2.\u201d\n\nIf Bitcoin was a security, issues would occur\n\nFurthermore, the SEC also noted that if Bitcoin was a security, \u201cit would then raise substantial other issues.\u201d More precisely, the cryptocurrency in question would be \u201can unregistered, publicly-offered security, and, among other things, it potentially would render the proposed fund an underwriter of bitcoin.\u201d\n\nLastly, the securities regulator also noted that Cipher did not adequately comply with legal and investor protection norms. The letter concludes by saying that the SEC \u201cstaff will not conduct additional review of Cipher in its present form.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported a week ago, debates are still ongoing on whether XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is a security.", "description": "Bitcoin is not a security, says the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in a letter to Cipher Technologies Bitcoin Fund", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNDQwZjNlZGJkYmY1NTEyMmFhMGI3YjU2Y2FjZGQ0YWUuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
