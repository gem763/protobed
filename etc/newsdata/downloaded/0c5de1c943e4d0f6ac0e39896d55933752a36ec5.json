He brings the rest of his family, one by one, into the fancy Park compound, getting his dad hired as a driver, his sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) brought in as a therapist, and his mom, Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), installed as a maid. It\u2019s all a subterfuge, and it\u2019s all accomplished through tricks of privilege: knowing the right people, producing the right college diploma, and knowing when to be obsequiously deferential.\n\nOnce the entire Kim family is assembled within the Park household, things unsurprisingly start to spiral out of control, though because this is a Bong Joon-ho film, conflicts develop in a manner that\u2019s hard to predict. Initially, Parasite seems like a Dickensian thriller of sorts, a black comedy of haves and have-nots doing silent battle. But one of Bong\u2019s strengths is his love for every character he creates, even the comically uninformed Mrs. Park (Jo Yeo-jeong) and her snooty husband (Lee Sun-kyun). Everyone in the movie is something of a fool, which is just about the only thing that bonds them together.\n\nAs the plot of Parasite metamorphoses, the film becomes more of a bleak tale about how financial polarization and late-stage capitalism have made it literally impossible for people to understand each other across the class divide. Bong accomplishes that partly through his incisive script. But the insular setting of Parasite also lets the director experiment with searing imagery that uses human faces and simple household environments to create visions of hilarity as well as pure horror. One of the film\u2019s pivotal moments revolves around a misunderstanding: One character mistakes another for something terrifying. Bong revels in showing viewers both sides of the encounter, one scary and the other sad, a microcosm of Parasite\u2019s parable of division.\n\nBong has always been a political storyteller, in the sense that he knows any kind of story can be political. Memories of Murder is a taut, true-life whodunit, but it\u2019s also a portrayal of how police investigations balance on a knife-edge of justice and corruption. The Host is a classic monster movie, but it delivers thrills while showing how so many modern cities fail their citizens. Okja is a fairy tale about one girl\u2019s love for a magical pig, but it follows that narrative right into an industrial slaughterhouse. Parasite stands out for having less of an outr\u00e9 genre selling point, but that just makes its narrative swerve even more chilling. All the viewer knows is that Bong is telling a story about humans, which means it can be a perfect comedy until it becomes a tragedy.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
