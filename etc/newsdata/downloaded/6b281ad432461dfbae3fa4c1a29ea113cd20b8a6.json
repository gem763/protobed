The show is a labyrinthine, immersive journey through 10 wildly imaginative photoshoots. As Walker puts it: \u201cEach shoot is a love letter to an object, sometimes several objects.\u201d\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Style, beauty and black identity\n\n- What does it mean to be camp?\n\n- The dress that made the world gasp\n\nThe exhibition is named after the phrase used by an awestruck archaeologist in 1922 on seeing for the first time the glittering contents of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb: \u201cwonderful things\u201d. And the trademark Walker-wonderland preoccupations are all here \u2013 the English countryside, fairy tales, male nudes, and his influences in art and photography, from Beaton and Lartigue to children\u2019s book illustrator Arthur Rackham.\n\nA leading international fashion photographer, Walker rose to prominence in the 1990s, becoming a star contributor to British Vogue. He has since become well-known for his otherworldly, surrealist, and occasionally grotesque images, both in fashion and portraiture.\n\nThroughout, the V&A artefacts are displayed alongside the photographic work that they inspired, lending the objects that ignited Walker\u2019s imagination a certain talismanic quality. \u201cWe had a special time through the whole journey of the exhibition,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like the exhibition guided us itself. Nothing was forced; it was a really gentle process. It lifted us up and it felt like it had a power all of its own.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the whole experience of creating Wonderful Things has been \u201chealing\u201d says Walker. In what way? \u201cThere was a point where I was having a bad time. It was a low point. But by engaging with beauty, it put my predicament into perspective. It was a balm that elevated me in that low period, and I managed to ascend my mood by engaging with a 16th-Century stained-glass window, or an embroidered casket, or a Constable painting of clouds. For me it was a meditation and medication.\u201d\n\nThe photographic series Illuminations, in which models are depicted, cocoon-like, in long Moncler puffer coats, was inspired by a 16th-Century stained-glass artwork, Tobias and Sara on their Wedding Night, 1520. The transparent piece struck Walker as a \u201ctouching depiction\u2026 the depth of the room and an atmosphere of cosiness and domesticity \u2013 the slippers, the dog, the couple in bed \u2013 it makes me feel very peaceful.\u201d The vibrant red of the curtains brought to mind his childhood. His mother made red silk lampshades which illuminated the family home, a welcoming glow to come home to.\n\nWhy Not Be Oneself?, a striking set of images of the actor Tilda Swinton in elaborate Gucci turban and tunic and giant Lisa Eisner jewellery, was inspired by a 1962 photograph of the poet Dame Edith Sitwell by Sir Cecil Beaton. In the pictures Swinton, who is a distant descendent of Sitwell, channels her ancestor \u2013 complete with distinctive pencilled eyebrows \u2013 at Renishaw Hall, the Sitwell family seat in Derbyshire. The piece is \u201ca celebration of age and a celebration of difference. Tilda manifested Edith Sitwell\u2019s striking weirdness and her belief in her weirdness.\u201d\n\nThis exhibition is fantasy, yes, but it connects to the real world \u2013 Susanna Brown\n\nCurator of Photographs at the V&A Susanna Brown worked closely with Walker throughout the process. \u201cHe has a boundless imagination,\u201d she tells BBC Culture. \u201cThe exhibition features 10 distinct worlds, each with their own soundscape, in which he weaves together all the different threads. There is a narrative in his work, he\u2019s a conjurer, and he conjures up scenes of make-believe.\u201d He is also, importantly, a collaborative artist, she adds. \u201cHe\u2019s like a conductor of an orchestra, coaxing the best out of them. He has a shared vision with his collaborators, whether he\u2019s making a portrait or creating a fashion fantasy.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no denying the magical, fairy tale quality of Walker\u2019s vision \u2013 a word often used to describe his work is \u2018fantastical\u2019. But at a time when the world is full of challenges \u2013 climate crisis, poverty, political instability \u2013 where does \u2018fantastical\u2019 fashion and photography fit in? It is an existential question facing the fashion world at the moment. Are such things merely an indulgence, frivolity, a form of escapism? No, in Brown\u2019s view. \u201cThere\u2019s space in the creative world for a broad spectrum of work,\u201d says the curator. \u201cWe need functional clothes but we need to express ourselves, our personalities, our emotion, our mood \u2013 through our dress. And this exhibition is fantasy, yes, but it connects to the real world.\u201d\n\nOf this world\n\nWalker\u2019s long-time collaborator, the art director Shona Heath, agrees that Wonderful Things is \u201cvery much of this world,\u201d for all its fairy-tale mood. Heath tells BBC Culture: \u201cFor instance, all body types are shown here \u2013 small, big, fat, thin, all beautiful. It\u2019s also a celebration of gay love, and of strong women. For Tim, Edith Sitwell is incredibly beautiful, as beautiful as any young woman. It\u2019s all beautiful. That\u2019s not exactly the message of the exhibition, but that\u2019s where it comes from.\u201d\n\nThe art director, who creates the sets for Walker\u2019s pictures, describes the exhibition as \u201ca gift\u201d and Walker as a great collaborator: \u201cWe genuinely inspire each other. We both had a good grounding in art history before we met each other, and we shared a love of many things, including photographic influences and children\u2019s book illustration.\u201d\n\nThese shared passions can be seen in the exhibit Box of Delights, another series of images. The idea was inspired by a 17th-Century embroidered casket and a court mantua from the museum collection. Heath created a chintzy sitting-room in which the photographs are displayed, as well as a large-scale secret garden, used in the shoot. As Heath explains: \u201cIt\u2019s about a young man brought up in a [British] northern working-class world, and feeling caged like a butterfly; he then flourishes and shows his true colours. It\u2019s about being transgender and the flamboyance \u2013 and the hardship \u2013 involved in that. The performers are not \u2018styled\u2019, these are their own personas.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Cloud 9 has a contemporary, real-world narrative. The vision for the photographic shoot was sparked by an exquisite 16th-Century, watercolour-and-gold painting, Krishna and Indra, from the Mughal Empire. The images it inspired are set in the English countryside on a glorious summer\u2019s day, with models of Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage. As Editor-in-chief of British Vogue Edward Enninful puts it in the book of the exhibition: \u201cCertain individuals might be preaching hate, but look, here is a celebration of a culture that\u2019s not just Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi, but also British, a new Britain you could say.\u201d\n\nThe V&A objects are a balm from the darker times of humankind \u2013 Tim Walker\n\nIn Cloud 9, as in all the other shoots, the models and performers contributed ideas and played a creative part. Walker is passionate about the collaborative process. \u201cI think with the type of pictures I do, I can\u2019t do it on my own, it needs a team of people,\u201d he tells BBC Culture. \u201cBeing a photographer can be lonely but the pathway I\u2019ve chosen is never lonely because I\u2019m engaging with the team and with the performers and they become friends. It\u2019s like a family, a party celebration.\u201d\n\nIn another section of the show, the artefact that ignited the photographer\u2019s imagination is a hand-painted photograph of the Bayeux Tapestry. In Walker\u2019s interpretation of the tapestry, the soldiers are depicted as eco-warriors, and all the sets, props and costumes have been knitted, crocheted, crafted, homemade and recycled. The section is named Soldiers of Tomorrow.\n\nCreating the exhibition has been an emotional experience, Walker tells BBC Culture, and an answer of sorts to the world\u2019s woes. How does he see the role of art? \u201cWhen I pick up a newspaper I see darkness,\u201d he says. \u201cBut not all humanity is dark. Any kind of fashion, art, photography, decorative art, if it\u2019s genuine, is valid. And a sense of playfulness is the nobler thing.\u201d The dazzling, exquisite objects and artefacts in the V&A\u2019s collections are, he says, \u201ca balm from the darker times of humankind, they\u2019re the voices of light.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s enlightening, this level of beauty, and humbling. I had an emotional response to it, so what we\u2019re doing with the exhibition is to honour the beauty of these things. I want it to be a celebration of the healing properties of humankind\u2019s beauty.\u201d\n\nTim Walker: Wonderful Things is at the V&A Museum, London, runs from 21 September to 8 March 2020.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.
