(AP) - Ilya Samsonov was stellar in his NHL debut and helped the Washington Capitals stay perfect in two road games to start the season.\n\nT.J. Oshie scored the tiebreaking goal, Samsonov stopped 25 shots, and the Capitals beat the Islanders 2-1 Friday night to spoil New York\u2019s season opener.\n\n\u201cFirst win in the NHL, I feel wonderful,\u201d the 22-year-old Samsonov said, before getting a shaving cream pie to the face from teammate Tom Wilson. \u201cEverybody helped me, played a good game.\u201d\n\nCapitals coach Todd Rierden was also pleased with the debut of his young goalie, the 22nd overall pick in 2015 who played for Hershey of the AHL last season.\n\n\u201cI thought he played great,\u201d Rierden said. \u201cHe looked very comfortable. I thought it was a great first game for a highly touted prospect.\u201d\n\nJakub Vrana got his second goal in two games for the Capitals, who opened the season with a 3-2, overtime win at St. Louis on Wednesday night.\n\nDevon Toews scored for the Islanders and Semyon Varlamov, making his Islanders debut, made 26 saves.\n\n\u201cI thought we\u2019d be a little bit rusty not having played already,\u201d New York coach Barry Trotz said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mind our first (period). \u2026 The second period I thought we played a little bit better, certainly got a little bit of momentum. They scored a power-play goal and in the third they were the better team.\u201d\n\nBoth teams had chances in this matchup of the Metropolitan Division\u2019s top teams from last season. The Capitals finished first but were beaten by Carolina in seven games in the first round. The Islanders, who finished a point behind, swept Pittsburgh in the first round before being swept by the Hurricanes.\n\nLars Eller nearly extended Washington\u2019s lead to two goals but his shot went off the crossbar 5:40 into the third period, and Mathew Barzal\u2019s attempt to tie it hit a goalpost nearly two minutes later.\n\nThe Islanders pulled Varlamov for an extra skater with about a minute left, but couldn\u2019t get the tying goal.\n\n\u201cIt was a really good road win,\u201d Oshie said. \u201cYou get up on a team in their barn, especially on opening night, you know they will keep coming. We did a good job of deterring them from many chances and making them go 200 feet every time.\u201d\n\nWith the score tied 1-1 after 20 minutes, Samsonov made a nice glove save on a shot by Cal Clutterbuck 17 seconds into the middle period.\n\nTom Wilson nearly put Washington ahead at the 5 1/2-minute mark of the period as he beat Varlamov with a hard shot, but the puck went off the left post.\n\nOshie gave the Capitals a 2-1 lead with a power-play goal late in the period. With the Islanders\u2019 Brock Nelson off for hooking, John Carlson\u2019s shot was blocked by Scott Mayfield, but the puck came to Oshie in the middle and he backhanded it in from his knees up over Varlamov\u2019s glove with 2:17 left.\n\nVrana, who scored in overtime to give Washington a 3-2 win at St. Louis on Wednesday night, got the Capitals on the scoreboard first. He got a pass from Eller as he crossed the center line on the right side, skated up and fired a shot from the right circle that went off Varlamov\u2019s glove and in with 9:35 left in the opening period.\n\nThe Islanders tied it with a fluky goal that deflected off multiple Capitals players with 7:33 left. Toews sent a harmless looking shot toward the goal from the left side, and the puck deflected off Nic Dowd\u2019s right skate toward the middle, where it deflected off Garnet Hathaway\u2019s right skate and then Radko Gudas\u2019 left skate toward the right corner of the net. Samsonov slid over and stretched his left leg out, but the puck bounced off his left skate and then the post and in.\n\nNOTES: Carlson has three assists in two games this season. \u2026 Since trailing St. Louis 2-0 in the first period on Wednesday night, the Capitals have a 5-1 scoring edge. \u2026 The teams meet three more times this season: Dec. 31 at Washington, Jan. 18 at the Nassau Coliseum, and Feb. 10 at Washington. Last season, the teams split their four-game series, with the road team winning each contest. \u2026 Varlamov signed a four-year deal on July 1, replacing Vezina Trophy finalist and fan-favorite Robin Lehner. \u2026 C Derick Brassard, signed to a one-year deal, also made his Islanders debut. \u2026 The Islanders, beginning a season at home for just the 10th time in franchise history, dropped to 0-4-3 in their last seven season openers on home ice.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCapitals: Host Carolina on Saturday night in their home opener\n\nIslanders: Host Winnipeg on Sunday night for the middle game of a season-opening three-game homestand.\n\n___\n\nFollow Vin Cherwoo at www.twitter.com/VinCherwooAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ilya Samsonov was stellar in his NHL debut and helped the Washington Capitals stay perfect in two road games to start the season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Vin A.
