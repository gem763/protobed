It\u2019s the only one,\u201d Murdoch said. \u201cFrankly, I feel in this country we all have to be more tolerant of each other\u2019s views\u2026 we\u2019ve come to this point where we are more and more intolerant of each other and frankly that has to change.\u201d\n\nMurdoch said Fox News programs its content \u201cto everyone,\u201d calling it an \u201call-state media organization\u201d and that targets viewers from \u201cCalifornia and New York but also, everywhere in between.\u201d\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % FOXA FOX CORP. 30.05 -0.55 -1.78% DIS WALT DISNEY COMPANY 128.47 -2.43 -1.86%\n\nMurdoch explained that many detractors of Fox News only see small, often-out-of-context viral clips from the network\u2019s opinion shows that air in the morning and during primetime\u2013 but the audience tuning in for straight news is significantly larger.\n\n\u201cFrankly, our biggest critics of Fox News are not watching Fox News. They\u2019re picking up pieces from Twitter\u2026 social media and elsewhere,\u201d he said.\n\nMurdoch pointed to Chris Wallace, Shepard Smith and Martha MacCallum as hard news anchors that helps make up the majority of the network\u2019s programming -- explaining that opinion hosts only make up a few hours of content per day on the 24/7 network.\n\n\u201cFar more people watching the news hours than the opinion hours,\u201d Murdoch said.\n\nRoss Sorkin asked Murdoch how he feels about President Trump \u201cliking\u201d the network, but the 21st Century Fox executive chairman didn\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cI think he dislikes us less than everyone else,\u201d Murdoch said. \u201cIf you look at Shepard Smith, if you look at Chris Wallace, Geraldo was on \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 this morning criticizing the president\u2026 there is a huge number of hours per day\u2026 that do not agree with Trump.\u201d\n\nRoss Sorkin then brought up whether or not Fox News is responsible for a recent bombs sent to Democratic leaders after Cesar Sayoc \u2013 who has a lengthy rap sheet -- was arrested as the suspected bomber.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility for a criminal who was a criminal before Fox News even started,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s unfair to make that criticism.\u201d\n\nMurdoch reminded the audience that several non-political media business are also under the New Fox umbrella, such as Fox Sports 1. Ross Sorkin pondered if Murdoch considered the \u201coptics\u201d when he hired former White House communications director Hope Hicks to run communications for the new company. But the media mogul explained that he was simply putting the \u201cabsolute best\u201d team in place.\n\n\u201c[Hicks] is an incredible executive with incredible experience,\u201d he said. \u201cNo connection to the White House.\u201d\n\nMurdoch explained that New Fox \u2013 which is largely an American company -- is built to thrive on live events but he plans to invest \u201caggressively\u201d when it comes to adding entertainment content to the brand.\n\n\u201cWe will buy other things,\u201d he said. \u201dWe will be acquisitive and we intend to grow.\u201d\n\nWhile Murdoch hopes to build New Fox, he wouldn\u2019t be shocked if his father eventually sold the Wall Street Journal -- because nothing would surprise him after 21st Century Fox assets were sold to Disney.\n\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d he said.\n\nThe extensive chat then shifted to Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News star who is currently negotiating her exit from NBC News after a disastrous stint ended with her show being canceled over comments about whether or not \u201cblackface\u201d is racist. While New Fox is looking to acquire assets, he didn\u2019t seem open to a return for the former FNC host.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Megyn\u2019s. I like her a lot, we didn\u2019t want her to leave Fox when she did. Having said that, I\u2019m very happy with our current lineup,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be making any changes.\u201d\n\nAs far as Murdoch\u2019s personal politics, he explained that he doesn\u2019t necessarily fit into a specific category, as he is often Conservative on economic policy issues but socially liberal.\n\n\u201cRunning media organizations, you need to be an independent thinker,\u201d he said.\n\n21st Century Fox is the parent company of FOX Business and Fox News.", "description": "Lachlan Murdoch speaks candidly about the future of the New Fox.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/11/0/0/Lachlan-Murdoch-Top.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2018-11-01"}
