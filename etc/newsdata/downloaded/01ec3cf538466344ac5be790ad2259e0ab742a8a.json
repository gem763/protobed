First there was \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d (because he refuses to do anything significant to stop Russian interference in U.S. elections), and then there was \u201cMassacre Mitch\u201d and even \u201cMurder Turtle\u201d (because he refuses to take up gun-violence legislation despite massacre after massacre). At the risk of hurting the Kentucky Republican\u2019s tender feelings still further, I suggest another moniker: Muzzle Mitch.\n\nMcConnell, who styles himself a champion of free speech, has lately not been such a fan of free speech directed against him. The psychological boo-boos done to his thin skin have stirred him to hypocrisy.\n\nOn radio host (and Post contributor) Hugh Hewitt\u2019s show this week, McConnell renewed his complaint that calling him Moscow Mitch is unacceptable \u2014 \u201cmodern-day McCarthyism,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, I can laugh about things like the Grim Reaper, but calling me Moscow Mitch is over the top.\u201d\n\nOh? McCarthyism, by definition, is a type of defamation using indiscriminate allegations based on unsubstantiated charges. But the allegations underlying Moscow Mitch are specific and well-substantiated. He has blocked virtually every meaningful bill to prevent a repeat of Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference. He led the effort to help a Russian oligarch\u2019s business evade sanctions, and when that business then made a substantial investment in Kentucky, former McConnell aides lobbied for it.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s view that the speech he dislikes is defamatory clashes with his professed First Amendment devotion. His money-is-speech argument has prevailed at the Supreme Court, causing the current flood of unlimited dark money in politics and the unparalleled vitriol it injected. He has, to his credit, defended flag burning, saying, \u201cin this country we have a long tradition of respecting unpleasant speech.\u201d He also has championed free speech on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cHearing criticisms of one\u2019s beliefs and learning the beliefs of others is simply training for life in a democratic society,\u201d he said in June 2017. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean one has to agree with those opinions, but no one is served by trapping oneself and others in cocoons of ignorance. That is hardly the recipe for a free and informed society.\u201d\n\nHe and his aides have certainly asserted their own rights to make objectionable speech. Hours after the El Paso shooting in August, his campaign tweeted a photo of fake tombstones bearing the name of McConnell\u2019s Democratic Senate challenger Amy McGrath, among others. McGrath protested that McConnell used \u201cimagery of the death of a political opponent (me).\u201d In another contemporaneous incident, young men (apparently volunteers) wearing \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d campaign T-shirts posed in an Instagram photo groping and choking a cardboard cutout of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\nMcConnell\u2019s campaign brushed off both, saying the tombstones were a light-hearted homage to a cartoon, and the young men were not campaign staff and their actions not \u201csignificant news.\u201d\n\nBut Team Mitch takes a less tolerant view of speech directed at him. In July, McConnell delivered a tirade on the Senate floor denouncing criticism of him (by me and others) as a threat to America\u2019s survival. \u201cKeeping our Republic means we can\u2019t let modern-day McCarthyism win,\u201d he said.\n\nIn August, when I detailed McConnell\u2019s role in helping Russian interests escape sanctions, his former campaign manager (and still informal adviser) Josh Holmes proposed that McConnell file \u201ca defamation suit\u201d against me, adding: \u201cThis guy deserves to lose his job and the Post should pay a price.\u201d\n\nAnd when 25 anti-gun-violence demonstrators protested outside McConnell\u2019s Louisville home in August, McConnell\u2019s campaign said these were \u201cserious calls to physical violence, and we\u2019ve alerted law enforcement.\u201d But Louisville police told the New York Post the group was \u201cprotesting peacefully.\u201d\n\nExamples of threats, taken from expletive-laden Facebook Live footage, included signs saying \u201cF--- YOU MURDER TURTLE\u201d and a woman who encouraged somebody to stab a hypothetical voodoo doll representing McConnell in the heart and wished that McConnell, in a recent fall, had broken his neck.\n\nTalk of violence against public officials (and journalists) is disgusting, albeit commonplace these days, and I deplore the vulgar speech outside his residence. But this sounds more like the \u201cunpleasant\u201d but protected speech McConnell once defended than the criminal \u201cactual threats\u201d McConnell\u2019s team claimed. (Ironically, a McConnell campaign tweet showing demonstration footage caused Twitter to make the dubious call to block the campaign\u2019s account.)\n\nCongress returns next week, and McConnell will again do his muzzling thing. He has served notice that he will squelch debate on any gun-related proposal unless President Trump supports it. \u201cIf the president is in favor,\u201d he told Hewitt, \u201cI\u2019ll put it on the floor.\u201d\n\nNo alternative ideas will be considered. Thus spake Muzzle Mitch.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "Mitch McConnell hasn\u2019t been a fan of free speech lately.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "September At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
