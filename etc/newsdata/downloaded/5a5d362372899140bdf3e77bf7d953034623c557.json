He says he made that decision after an insurance settlement from the fire failed to cover the cost to rebuild.\n\nThe building burned down in December 2017. Investigators determined that kitchen rags self-ignited to start the fire.\n\nSpontaneous combustion can occur when heat generated through rapid oxidation causes various materials to catch fire.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: KCCI-TV, http://www.kcci.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The owner of a popular Des Moines bowling alley that burned to the ground nearly two years ago says he will not rebuild the venue.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
