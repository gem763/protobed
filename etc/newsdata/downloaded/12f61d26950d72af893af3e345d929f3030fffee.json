Vietnam, Heineken's second most profitable market, was strong as the company pushed deeper into the country. Cambodia was even stronger.\n\nBy contrast, beer sales in the Americas unexpectedly fell, by 0.5%. There was a sharp decline in the United States, where its Mexican lager Tecate slid further.\n\nThere was also a slight decline in Brazil, where Heineken became the second largest player in 2017 by buying the loss-making operations there of Japan's Kirin (T: ).\n\nHeineken said sales of cheaper beers there had declined after a price rise, while volumes of higher-priced beers such as Heineken, Amstel and Devassa grew by a double-digit percentage.\n\nEconomic growth has been erratic in Brazil, with a contraction in the first quarter. The country's central bank last month raised its growth forecast for 2019 to 0.9%, albeit with a high degree of uncertainty.\n\nIn Mexico, the company's largest market, sales were up by a low single-digit percentage, helped by the launch of low calorie Amstel Ultra. However, the company is now facing competition from rival AB InBev (BR: ) in the nationwide OXXO supermarkets where its brands were previously the only beers on sale.\n\nHeineken's beer sales in Europe, where it is the market leader, grew by 1.6%, against expectations of a decline a year on from the soccer World Cup and drinking boosted by good weather.\n\nGrowth in Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe was also 1.6%, but below expectations with unrest in Ethiopia leaving volumes flat there.", "description": "Brewer Heineken tempers profit hopes as Americas slip", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9M0EK_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
