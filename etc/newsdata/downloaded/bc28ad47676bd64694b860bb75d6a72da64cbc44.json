Actor Hugh Laurie described the behaviour as \"insolent\" and \"insufferable\".\n\nHowever, for others, the moment may underline the seeming stagnation of Parliament, swamped in debates and protocols, while the country waits for the Brexit crisis to be resolved.\n\nIn that sense, Mr Rees-Mogg's posture may actually be applauded by those who think Parliament is at odds with the people.\n\nFor others, it simply encapsulates the notion that the government's current approach to Brexit has been determined by an \"entitled elite\" that has little respect for the traditional democratic process.\n\nIt largely depends on your own point of view, probably.\n\nFor further interpretations of Mr Rees-Mogg's eye-catching repose, see the world wide web.\n\nSocial media users glued to the debate in Parliament unleashed a flood of creativity in response:\n\nSome questioned the political consequences of the Jacob Rees-Mogg meme outbreak.\n\nAs the BBC's technology desk editor, Leo Kelion, noted: \"The question is who it will best serve.\"\n\nOthers argued that jokes and memes would distract from the seriousness of what is happening in Parliament - and to the UK as a whole.", "description": "The Conservative MP's relaxed posture in Parliament unleashed a flood of creativity from web users.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mdnwd.jpg"}
