But even many leading Republicans have decried the American retreat from Syria \u2014 which allowed the Turkish invasion into northeast Syria earlier this month \u2014 as a foreign policy debacle.\n\n\u201cLet someone else fight over this long bloodstained sand,\u201d Mr. Trump said from the Diplomatic Room at the White House, flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the White House national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien. All three went to Ankara, the Turkish capital, last week to negotiate a pause in the fighting between Turkish forces and the Kurds.\n\nBut on Tuesday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia committed his military to joint security patrols with Turkish forces to enforce the cease-fire in northern Syria. Those patrols are part of an effort by Turkey and Russia to force Kurdish fighters from areas they had controlled in Syria, after American forces withdrew this month on Mr. Trump\u2019s order.", "description": "\u201cLet someone else fight over this long bloodstained sand,\u201d President Trump said of the fighting between American-allied Kurds and Turks.", "authors": ["Michael Crowley", "Lara Jakes"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/us/23dc-trump-sub/merlin_163179336_d784e0f2-9c32-4905-8852-359f5e00d520-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
