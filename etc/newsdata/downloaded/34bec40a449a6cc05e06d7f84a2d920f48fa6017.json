The curses and spells used in the books are actual curses and spells; which when read by a human being risk conjuring evil spirits into the presence of the person reading the text,\u201d the Reverend Reehill wrote, apparently in all seriousness.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Rowling\n\nRebecca Hammel, the superintendent of schools for the Catholic Diocese of Nashville, told The Tennessean that the Reverend Reehill had indeed sent the email and has the final say on the matter, since the Catholic Church does not have an official position on Ms Rowling\u2019s best-selling series.\n\n\u201cEach pastor has canonical authority to make such decisions for his parish school,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s well within his authority to act in that manner.\u201d\n\nThe school has recently opened a new library for its students, Ms Hammel explained, prompting the faculty to reassess its catalogue.\n\n\u201cI know that in the process they were going through and kind of weeding out some of the content in hopes of sprucing it up and improving the circulation,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Hammel did say the school would not stand in the way of students reading Harry Potter at their parents\u2019 discretion.\n\n\u201cShould parents deem that this or any other media to be appropriate we would hope that they would just guide their sons and daughters to understand the content through the lens of our faith,\u201d Hammel said.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t get into censorship in such selections other than making sure that what we put in our school libraries is age appropriate materials for our classrooms.\u201d", "description": "A Roman Catholic\u00a0school in Tennessee has banished JK Rowling's\u00a0universally popular series of Harry Potter novels from its library shelves after its pastor took exception to their portrayal of magic, warning the spells and curses the author describes are real\u00a0and \u201crisk conjuring evil spirits\u201d when read.", "authors": ["Joe Sommerlad"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/20/17/jk-rowling.jpg"}
