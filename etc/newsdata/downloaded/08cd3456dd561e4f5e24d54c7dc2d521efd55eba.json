Japan's Nikkei rose 0.13%.\n\nThe Brexit maelstrom, worries over slowing global growth and\n\ninternational trade frictions have kept investors on edge over\n\nrecent months. Oil futures fell as lingering economic growth\n\nconcerns and excess supplies of crude prompted speculators to\n\ntrim their long positions.\n\nThe pound slipped from a five-month high against the dollar\n\nand the euro after the British parliament forced Prime Minister\n\nBoris Johnson to seek a delay to an Oct. 31 deadline for\n\nBritain's departure from the bloc.\n\nThe vote for an extension dealt a blow to optimism that a\n\ndeal agreed last week would ensure Brexit happens with little\n\neconomic disruption. While the British government insisted Brexit will take place\n\non Oct. 31, uncertainty over whether the EU will agree a delay\n\nand how British lawmakers will respond could weigh on sentiment\n\nover the week.\n\n\"There is some uncertainty about Brexit, but it may not\n\nrattle investors too much because this is not an outright\n\nrejection of the deal,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market\n\nstrategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.\n\n\"Trading volumes are around 40% of what they would normally\n\nbe, which shows there's not a lot of conviction in the market.\"\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 fell 0.7% to $1.2908 and was off about\n\n0.4% to 86.50 per euro.\n\nU.S. stock futures nudged 0.06% higher in Asia as\n\ninvestors brace for high-profile earnings this week from\n\nMicrosoft Corp , Amazon.com and others.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.4% on Friday partly due to worries about\n\nfallout from the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nA 15-month long trade war between the United States and\n\nChina has shown few signs of a durable resolution being reached\n\ndespite several rounds of talks.\n\nFinancial markets have been whipsawed over this period as a\n\nsteady increase in tit-for-tat tariffs have slowed global trade\n\nand raised the risk of recession for some countries.\n\nUnderscoring the damage, Japan's exports fell in September\n\nfor the 10th straight month, while South Korea's exports for the\n\nfirst 20 days of October dived 19.5% year-on-year, data on\n\nMonday showed. Elsewhere in the currency markets, the dollar edged 0.1%\n\nhigher to $1.1158 per euro EUR=EBS but held steady at 108.45\n\nyen JPY=EBS as investors pondered the shifting scenarios for\n\nBrexit.\n\nU.S. crude fell 0.45% to $53.54 per barrel.\n\nMoney managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and\n\noptions positions in the week to Oct. 15, the U.S. Commodity\n\nFutures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.\n\nLong bets on U.S. crude have dropped sharply in the last two\n\nweeks after a spate of weak economic figures worldwide fanned\n\nconcerns about global energy demand.\n\nTreasury prices rose in Asia as investors sought safe\n\nhavens. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes\n\nfell to 1.7414%, while the two-year yield\n\nfell to 1.5675%.\n\nGold , another safe-haven asset, edged 0.11% higher to\n\n$1,491.28 per ounce.\n\n\n\n(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)\n\n", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian share markets cautious, pound stumbles on Brexit drama", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_1_800x533_L_1413124982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
