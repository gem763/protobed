The NASA astronaut Kathryn Sullivan became the first American woman to do so later the same year.\n\n\"You're right now on television all over the world, so don't get nervous,\" Trump added.\n\nHe paused for five seconds, then started to ask a question as one of the astronauts began responding to his initial comments. An aide explained to the president that there was \"about a four- or five-second delay.\"\n\nWhen the astronauts got the chance to respond, Meir politely corrected President Trump.\n\n\"We don't want to take too much credit because there have been many other female spacewalkers before us,\" Meir, who was doing her first-ever spacewalk, said. \"This is just the first time that there have been two women outside at the same time, and it's really interesting for us. We've talked a lot about it up here, you know, for us, this is really just us doing our jobs. It's something we've been training for for six years.\"\n\nSpace.com shared the video of the call (below) on its Youtube channel.\n\nMeir continued: \"We do, of course, want to give credit to all of those that came before us. There has been a long line of female scientists, explorers, engineers, and astronauts, and we have followed in their footsteps to get us where we are today. We hope that we can provide an inspiration to everybody, not only women, but to everybody that has a dream, that has a big dream and is willing to work hard to make that dream come true.\"", "description": "Christina Koch and Jessica Meir paused their important work on the space station to politely correct the president.
