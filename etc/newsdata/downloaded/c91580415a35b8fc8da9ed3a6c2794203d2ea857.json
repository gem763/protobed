Then she won him over.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "Luther \u201cLuke\u201d Campbell, the former 2 Live Crew frontman and \u201coriginal bad boy of hip-hop,\u201d absolutely torched Kamala Harris a few weeks after she announced her bid for president.\n\nWriting in the Miami New Times, Campbell argued many blue-collar African Americans, especially men, had made up their minds not to vote for the onetime prosecutor. He lumped her in with politicians who have denied defendants rehabilitation and targeted innocent people.\n\nAnd in a riff that critics slammed as sexist, Campbell questioned Harris\u2019 marriage to a white man. He even suggested she used a romantic relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown to advance her career.\n\n\u201cLike everyone else, black voters want help from one of their own,\u201d Campbell wrote, slipping in that Harris\u2019 mother was from India. \u201cThe Bushes made sure their people got oil money. Bill Clinton let the telecommunications industry gobble up small radio and TV stations. And Donald Trump is looking out for his developer buddies through a tax cut and opportunity zones that gentrify minority neighborhoods. Meanwhile, Harris has let black people know they can\u2019t count on her.\u201d\n\nRelated Video: Lower-Tier Democrats Shut Out of September Debate\n\nSo it was more than a little curious when Campbell announced very publicly he\u2019d changed his mind. In an Instagram video last week, he said he and Harris had recently talked on the phone about her record and presidential priorities, from gun control to the rehabilitation programs she started. Campbell said he wanted to determine whether she\u2019s a \u201creal sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went back and looked deeper at the record,\u201d Campbell said in an interview with POLITICO.\n\nBut the story of Campbell\u2019s about-face isn\u2019t so simple: It\u2019s a window into how Harris is working to allay skepticism of her among African Americans \u2014 particularly black men wary of her background in law enforcement \u2014 and of how far she has to go to make inroads with a critical constituency that Joe Biden so far is dominating in the polls.\n\nHarris and her surrogates routinely reach out to black influencers like Campbell, in most cases before they might publicly air any concerns. The campaign at times dispatches its chairman, the candidate's sister, Maya Harris, whose background in criminal justice reform and close relationship with the senator help provide insight only she could.\n\nThat Campbell could make the unexpected turn gives hope to an underlying theory Harris advisers have: that her courtroom experience will prove more of an asset than an anchor. But people on the outside involved in the discussions with Campbell stress that his hesitation underscores the work Harris must do to introduce herself while fleshing out her motives as California\u2019s attorney general and the district attorney of San Francisco.\n\n\u201cShe obviously has bona fides in certain parts of the black community: She\u2019s an HBCU graduate, an AKA. She is a black woman in every sense of the word,\u201d said Tiffany Cross, founder and managing editor of the Beat DC, a newsletter on the intersection of politics, policy and people of color, referring to Harris\u2019 time at Howard University and in the oldest African American sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha.\n\n\u201cBut the black community is not a monolith,\u201d Cross added. \u201cIn certain parts of the black community, HBCUs and AKAs just don\u2019t resonate. And, when people only hear whispers that you were the prosecutor who locked up black men, that\u2019s something that\u2019s an uphill climb. The campaign is trying to combat it, and trying to address it, but they have a long way to go.\u201d\n\nTo Harris, Campbell represents a hard-to-reach demographic she\u2019ll need to convince. Campbell, whose raw lyrics and videos with scantily clad women put him at the center of free speech fights decades ago, calls it the \u201csilent majority\u201d that powered Barack Obama.\n\nCampbell\u2019s evolution on Harris unfolded over many months. It started with calls from a surrogate and ended with Harris herself. In between, the rapper said he heard from a Florida congresswoman who endorsed Harris. He got beat up in testy interviews and at home: His wife, sister-in-law and mother-in-law are AKAs. He said they all really like Harris.\n\n***\n\nCampbell\u2019s New Times column landed online like a thunderclap. Symone Sanders, then a free-agent Democratic strategist who later took a job with Biden, essentially told Campbell to shut up.", "description": "The California senator has a ways to go to win over African American voters.
