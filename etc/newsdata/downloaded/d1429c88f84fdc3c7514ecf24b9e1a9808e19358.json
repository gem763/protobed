(Courtesy of the Clark Art Institute)\n\nNot for the first time, today\u2019s hysteria-fueled feminism looks barely distinguishable from a Victorian-style hysteria-fueled feminism.\n\nIt can\u2019t be in earnest, this headline. Can it? Did a human being actually strike the keys that formed these words that set out this accusation? And yet the evidence suggests we are not dealing with self-satire. Someone at The New Yorker typed the following headline: \u201cRenoir\u2019s Problem Nudes.\u201d\n\nRenoir\u2019s nudes are now . . . a problem? After Sonny Bunch\u2019s pioneering work on this matter \u2014 \u201cEverything\u2019s a Problem!\u201d declared the headline on his important 2015 piece in the Washington Free Beacon \u2014 you might guess that thoughtful individuals would quell any tendency to attach the noun in question to things that nobody thought posed difficulties until 17 seconds ago. Few, you would think, would risk being That Lady who stands up in a packed room of enthusiasts to declare, \u201cIt\u2019s a PROBLEM, I tell you!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet while factories may have closed in the Rust Belt, in Cambridge, San Francisco, and Brooklyn, their modern successors are chugging to life: These are the new Detroits of the problematization industry. Journalists and academics tirelessly work the line, allowed only one ten-minute break every 15 minutes to refresh themselves at the Kombucha cooler.\n\nWhat are the facts available to the prosecution in the case of People v. Renoir, indicted for multiple counts of being problematic in the first degree? Well, he painted nude women. But he didn\u2019t just paint them nude, he painted them beautiful. Attractive, sensual, voluptuous. He liked his naked ladies, Pierre-Auguste. He thought you would probably like them too. Renoir\u2019s nudes aren\u2019t an interrogation or a subversion. He isn\u2019t looking sideways or undermining expectations. He merely celebrates. Artists did that quite a lot in the 19th century. They didn\u2019t know that 21st-century minds would acclaim art in proportion to how expertly it administered a cosmic noogie to the bourgeoisie.\n\nBilled as the \u201cfirst-ever comprehensive investigation of Renoir\u2019s nudes\u201d (\u201cinvestigation\u201d!), Renoir: The Body, the Senses, at the Clark Art Institute, in Williamstown, Mass. (through September 22, then moving on to the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth this fall), comes with a thick catalogue of a trigger warning, by art historian Martha Lucy, that wonders how much we\u2019re allowed to enjoy Renoir\u2019s enjoyment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRenoir has \u201ccome to mean \u2018sexist male artist,\u2019\u201d according to Lucy in the catalogue, which bristles with reproving mentions of that toxic thing, the \u201cmale gaze.\u201d Men enjoy looking at women, especially nude, and the feminists are on this. \u201cIt is now well understood,\u201d says Lucy, \u201cthat Renoir\u2019s images of women \u2014 particularly nude women \u2014 are problematic.\u201d The paintings are also \u201cwidely understood as a prime example of what theorists and historians have termed \u2018the male gaze.\u2019\u201d In his nudes, \u201cwomen are passive, simply to be looked at. Deeply rooted in patriarchal culture, this dynamic . . .\u201d All right, that\u2019s enough of that.\n\nNew Yorker critic Peter Schjeldahl springs to his feet to endorse Lucy, saying the exhibition \u201csparks a sense of crisis\u201d because \u201cRenoir took such presumptuous, slavering joy in looking at naked women \u2014 who in his paintings were always creamy or biscuit white, often with strawberry accents, and ideally blond.\u201d Renoir might not have been a misogynist \u2014 but then again, maybe he was. \u201cIt feels wrong to term Renoir a misogynist, though he was certainly patriarchal,\u201d Schjeldahl writes, adding darkly that a letter in which Renoir celebrated \u201cancient times\u201d when \u201cwomen sang and danced for free\u201d might be \u201cworse than misogyny.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot for the first time, today\u2019s hysteria-fueled feminism looks barely distinguishable from a Victorian-style hysteria-fueled feminism. Then: Don\u2019t look at these nudes, they\u2019ll ignite your lust! Now: Don\u2019t look at these nudes, they\u2019re objectifying women! Schjeldahl adds that \u201cthe tactility of the later nudes, with brushstrokes like roving fingers, unsettles any kind of gaze, including the male.\u201d Renoir is unsettling? Art criticism enters the realm of Orwellian. Lies are truth, beauty is ugliness, and Renoir, that big comfy sofa of blooming luxury, is unsettling. Schjledahl throws in a jibe at the faces of Renoir\u2019s models: They \u201clook dumb,\u201d which is further evidence that Pierre-Auguste was more interested in painting women\u2019s forms than publishing lists of all the books they\u2019d read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchjeldahl musters a half-hearted defense of Renoir on grounds that he was \u201crevolutionary,\u201d that he helped engineer \u201cjolting aesthetic breakthroughs.\u201d This, too, is backwards: The circumstances of the era in which art is produced, with all of the squabbles and obsessions of the moment, fall away. What endures, drifting further and further from historical context, is the intrinsic quality of the art. A work must stand increasingly on its own two feet as the decades pass; a century after Renoir\u2019s death, his admirers stand less and less likely to be interested in boning up on whatever people were arguing about on Twitter in 1886.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour years ago, in the year 2 P.M.T. (Pre-MeToo), a more prescient art critic wrote an essay entitled \u201cHating Renoir Is Just a Phase\u201d in which he sketched out a trajectory of Renoir response: First you love, then you recoil to prove to everyone that you\u2019re sophisticated, then you acquire a bit of maturity and accept that love was the proper reaction the whole time. This critic was Peter Schjeldahl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRenoir\u2019s canvases bound into your lap like a friendly puppy, Schjeldahl wrote then. Just so! And friendly puppies are great. Much more enjoyable to have one of those thrown into your lap than, say, a rusty pair of oversized hedge trimmers. Making rusty hedge trimmers, alas, is mainly what contemporary art does. Guided by the tastes of critics and academics, the museums and galleries fill up with the ugly, the sordid, the cruel, the bilious, the strange. Sophisticated arts criticism is what\u2019s left behind after a laborious, slow strangulation of natural reaction (\u201cHey, that\u2019s pretty!\u201d) and replacement by an academy-manufactured cyborg programmed with a political module instead of an aesthetic one. Iconoclasm, interrogation, perpetual aggrievement, revolutionary fervor, the error of judging everything in the past by whatever the cadres of the unhappy are blaming for their woes today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShould you go to the Renoir exhibition? Of course. It\u2019s \u201ca hedonist\u2019s dreamland \u2014 a glorious celebration of the nude,\u201d in the words of Lance Esplund, writing in the Wall Street Journal. Revel in the canvases, ignore the chin-stroking about \u201cthe male gaze.\u201d", "description": "Art critics are jumping on the feminist bandwagon, calling acclaimed painter Renoir\u2019s famous nudes \u2018problematic.\u2019", "authors": ["Kyle Smith", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jonah Goldberg", "Kevin D.
