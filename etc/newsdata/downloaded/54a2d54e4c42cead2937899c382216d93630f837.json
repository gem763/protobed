Also, in the first episode, slain rapper Nipsey Hussle makes one of his final appearances, coaching aspiring musicians at 1500 Sound Academy in Inglewood, California.\n\nCardi B brings plenty of quotable commentary and colorful hairstyles to Netflix's hip-hop competition \"Rhythm + Flow.\" (Photo: Eddy Chen/Netflix)\n\nCardi B. stars alongside T.I., who serves as the sophisticated record-producer judge \u2013 with his upturned chin and dignified nods of approval \u2013 and Chance the Rapper, the friendly smiley emoji come to life who apologizes even when delivering quiet and gentle criticism.\n\nBut it\u2019s Cardi who lights up the room, with a fresh hair color in each location and a novel quip for every contestant. \u201cI\u2019m paid to be the mean one,\u201d she says with a twinkle in her eye and a fruity cocktail in her hand.\n\nCardi B\u2019s best lines from the \u201cRhythm + Flow\u201d auditions\n\nTo Inglewood IV, who ended his song with shouts of \u201cMurder! Murder! Murder!\u201d: \u201cI really wasn\u2019t feeling that murder thing. You know that scares white people.\u201d\n\nTo artist CNG after he didn\u2019t move much onstage: \u201cImagine you\u2019re performing in the strip club. People are going to look at you like (appears bored). \u2018Cause you don\u2019t wanna be a snooze fest.\u201d\n\nTo the less-than-emotive Streeb: \u201cI was really likin\u2019 what you said, but I just wanted it to touch me a little bit more. I want you to touch me... Oh, no no, I\u2019m married, I have children!\u201d\n\nTo the bespectacled, makeup-free Rae Khalil: \u201cI like you. You\u2019re very different from me.

I don\u2019t wanna make people mad because you ain't give them back they money.\u201d\n\nTo Steven Bonus, who was wearing a flannel shirt and glasses: \u201cYou really surprise me, because you look like you work in Best Buy.\u201d\n\nTo Ant Beale, whose nipples showed through his mesh shirt: \u201cWhen it comes to you, you didn\u2019t stab my heart, but you sliced it. I need you to stab me. You (just) pierced the nipple.\"\n\nTo fresh-faced Kay Makavel: \u201cAre you gonna make me some money? Because when you go into a label, these white folks be like (strokes an imaginary beard). They need to see the whole S sign with the whole ca-ching on it.\u201d\n\nTo the bilingual, jumpsuit-clad D Smoke: \u201cWhen I saw you, you look like you was gonna wash the floor, (but) you can write for me if you want to.\u201d\n\nAnd to T.I., after he described something as having an \u201cintangible benefit\u201d: \u201cHow do you know all of these fancy words?\u201d His reply: \u201cI\u2019ve been to prison, Cardi.
