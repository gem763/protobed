(AP) - The Latest from ACC men\u2019s basketball media day on Tuesday (all times local):\n\n11:10 a.m.\n\nDuke coach Mike Krzyzewski says he won\u2019t be surprised if the NBA expands its annual draft to include more than two rounds in the not-so-distant future.\n\nWith the league\u2019s increasing reliance on the G League to develop young players, Krzyzewski says \u201cif I\u2019m the owner of an NBA team and I have a G League affiliate I don\u2019t want to just protect two guys - I want to protect everybody.\u201d\n\nKrzyzewski says that could have an impact on the college game with more players turning professional earlier so they can get paid.\n\nHe says the NBA isn\u2019t going to stand still - and college athletics can\u2019t either, adding \u201cwe cannot keep our heads in the sand. \u2026 We are not good game planners. We are very reactionary.\u201d\n\nHe also says he expects the G League will increase in popularity, predicting it won\u2019t be long before its games are broadcast on national television.\n\n___\n\n10:45 a.m.\n\nAtlantic Coast Conference Commissioner John Swofford says he is \u201copen minded\u201d when it comes to college athletes being paid for endorsement deals.\n\nLast month California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law that goes into effect in 2023 allowing athletes at universities in his state make money from their images, names or likenesses. The law also bans schools from kicking athletes off the team if they get paid.\n\nSwofford says that California law is \u201cextreme,\u201d but added that he is not opposed to \u201cmodernizing\u201d rules for amateur athletics. However, he says he would prefer a consistent national approach rather than individual states laws that can vary.\n\nSwofford says, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to be the end of college athletics by any means. We\u2019ve been resilient in the past and we will be now and we will be in the future.\u201d\n\n___\n\n10:15 a.m.\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference will open the season trying to replace a significant amount of star power.\n\nThe league holds its preseason men\u2019s basketball media day on Tuesday in Charlotte, North Carolina. The ACC is coming off its third national championship in five years with Virginia winning that program\u2019s first title.\n\nYet the league must replace several big names, including national player of the year Zion Williamson from Duke, the headliner among the league\u2019s 10 NBA first-round draft picks in June.\n\nLouisville\u2019s Jordan Nwora and Notre Dame\u2019s John Mooney are the only returning all-ACC players.\n\nTuesday\u2019s schedule includes a full day of interviews for players and coaches, which includes Virginia Tech\u2019s Mike Young as the lone new coach.\n\nThe ACC will release media picks for preseason favorite and all-conference players Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest from ACC men's basketball media day on Tuesday (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/acc_media_day_basketball_93830_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
