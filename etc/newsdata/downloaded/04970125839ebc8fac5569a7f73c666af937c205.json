Fuck \u2019em,\u201d he said defiantly, as CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter reminded De Niro that although he hadn\u2019t violated FCC regulations, it was still a Sunday morning.\n\nDe Niro\u2019s comments may have shocked viewers, but he received a standing ovation with similar remarks at the 2018 Tony Awards when went from introducing Bruce Springsteen to engaging in political activism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer down with Trump, it\u2019s fuck Trump,\u201d he declared.\n\nThe actor\u2019s latest statements come just before the London Film Festival screening of Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Irishman\u201d in which De Niro stars as Frank Sheeran, the alleged Bufalino crime family hitman suspected of having killed Teamster Jimmy Hoffa in 1975.", "description": "The actor said he \"can't wait\" to see the occupant of the White House behind bars.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da0bc90210000b908acd0bd.jpeg?cache=8jrruftw15&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
