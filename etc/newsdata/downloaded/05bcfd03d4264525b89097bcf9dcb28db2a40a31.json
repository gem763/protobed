Which means our Elevator Interview \u2014 the weekly chats we\u2019ve been conducting with Times writers and editors to get inside their heads about how they do their jobs \u2014 took place over email.\n\nThat was no problem for Veronica Chambers, who has an early morning writing ritual that, at times, has involved her sleeping on her kitchen floor to ensure that she would be so uncomfortable that she wakes up early. It appears to have worked: She is the author of more than a dozen books, including her most recent, \u201cQueen Bey: A Celebration of the Power and Creativity of Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter,\u201d and is editor of the Times archival storytelling project, Past Tense.\n\nIHW: Tell us about your morning routine, if you have one.\n\nI am all about the morning. I was a night person for a really, really long time. And then, little by little, I trained myself into being a morning person. When I wrote my first book , I loved sleeping in so much. But I wanted to be a writer so I had to work it out because I had a full-time job. I would literally set the oven timer for six hours, which was the max time on my oven, and then I\u2019d sleep on the kitchen floor so I\u2019d be uncomfortable enough that I\u2019d wake up.\n\nToni Morrison once said about writing at dawn: \u201cWriters all devise ways to approach that place where they expect to make the contact, where they become the conduit, or where they engage in this mysterious process. For me, light is the signal in the transaction. It\u2019s not being in the light, it\u2019s being there before it arrives.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been really lucky to interview Ms. Morrison onstage three times, and although there is an entire universe that worships her, I take her writing advice very, very personally and seriously. So I try to do a little reading or a little writing most days at sunrise.", "description": "Shouldn\u2019t we all take a lesson from Queen Bey?", "authors": ["The New York Times"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/30/us/08-30-2019-IHW-VChambers-Illustration/08-30-2019-IHW-VChambers-Illustration-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
