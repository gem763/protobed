Here, in exclusive excerpts from her new book, Harry recalls Blondie\u2019s meteroric rise to the top \u2014 and the sex, drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll along the way ...\n\n\"Fame was a sensual sort of feeling, initially,\" she said.\n\nDEBBIE HARRY REVEALS SHE WAS RAPED AT KNIFEPOINT, BELIEVES SHE ESCAPED TED BUNDY\n\n\"It felt like having sex, a wash of electricity coursing through your fingers and your legs, sometimes a flushed feeling at the base of your throat. It was exciting, but at the same time strangely anticlimactic.\n\n\"I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that for me, the best of Blondie was the early days of the band, when we were struggling artists scuttling around New York\u2019s Lower East Side just trying to get something going. Everybody got by on no money.\n\n\"Nobody talked about mainstream success. Who wanted to be mainstream? What we were doing was so much better than that.\n\nBLONDIE CANCELS U.K. SHOWS AFTER ARIANA GRANDE MANCHESTER ATTACK\n\n\"Blondie had become a recognizable name in some small way but nobody in the music business was looking at us. Chris was on welfare, I was a bikini bartender in the financial district and we occasionally sold some pot to make a few bucks. At this point, Blondie was an underdog, way down at the bottom of the heap.\n\n\"CBGB\u2019s, at 315 Bowery, has become a legend, but in those days it was a dive bar on the ground floor of one of the many flophouses that lined the avenue.\n\n\"We played CBGB\u2019s every weekend for seven months straight. We didn\u2019t make money, we got paid in beers.\n\n\"You were lucky if they were charging two dollars at the door.\n\n\"The crowd was almost all our friends, all the other bands, downtown artists and freaks.\n\n\"It was an immediate, smaller, tighter, more private world then. Everybody on the scene did drugs. That\u2019s how it was back then, part of your social life, part of the creative process, chic and fun and really just there.\n\n\"The first time I had done heroin was with Gil Fields, my boyfriend at the time and the drummer in my first band, The Wind In The Willows.\n\nDEBBIE HARRY'S KEY PIECE OF ADVICE FOR ASPIRING ARTISTS\n\n\"I remember his tapping out this tiny little line of grey powder. And we snorted it up. And I felt a kind of rush I\u2019d never felt before.\n\n\"I thought: 'Oh, this is so nice, so relaxing. Aah, I don\u2019t have to think about things.' It was so delicious and delightful. For those times when I wanted to blank out parts of my life or when I was dealing with some depression, there was nothing better than heroin. Nothing.\n\n\"No one thought about the consequences. I can\u2019t remember if any of us even knew the consequences.\n\n\"It may sound strange when you are talking about drugs but it was a more innocent time. They weren\u2019t doing scientific studies and setting up methadone clinics.\n\n\"If you wanted to do drugs, you did drugs. And if you got hung up or got sick, you were on your own. Curiosity was a big factor too \u2014 drugs were another new experience to check out.\n\nFRIARS ROAST SENDS TRUMP, BLONDIE RUNNING\n\n\"Back in the early days of the band, we were living in the 'Blondie Loft' \u2014 we also rehearsed there, even played a show there.\n\n\"Chris shot some great photos of me in and around the loft. I knew I looked OK. I had a good face, but I was always unsure about my body.\n\n\"Chris made me look better. He had these voyeuristic leanings, staring at me fixedly for hours in the heat of the lights, as I posed as sexily as I could to get him going. But he didn\u2019t need any help in getting going, he was already going. Chris and I would always end up in bed after a shoot.\n\n\"We had been living in the Blondie Loft for a little over a year when the landlord threw us out.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know why he did it. The timing was pretty terrible. It was August 1976 and we had started working on Blondie\u2019s debut album.\n\n\"Years later, our crazy ex-landlord would claim it was his pact with the devil that had made Blondie successful.\n\nKATEY SAGAL HAD ON-OFF ROMANCE WITH GENE SIMMONS\n\n\"We were tenacious. We kept working. We sharpened up and built a following. Now, finally, we had a record deal.\n\n\"Strapped to a rocket and ready to be launched, this was that time when we really took off. I mean, took off.\n\n\"It was a riotous, breathless, restless, crazy period, much of it a blur now, from the speed with which it all unfolded. After the release of our first album, we played a bunch of shows in New York \u2014 then in February \u201977 we hit the road for the first time. And we stayed on the road.\n\n\"Playing the Whisky in LA was a big turnaround for Blondie. Tom Petty opened for us the first week.\n\n\"The second week we played with the Ramones, which was when things got crazier. There were just a few very small dressing rooms upstairs at the Whisky, which we all shared.\n\n\"Bands, girlfriends, guests and hangers-on all crammed into these little rooms.\n\n\"One night Malcolm McLaren of the Sex Pistols got into some kind of argument with Johnny Ramone and Johnny chased him out of the dressing room, swinging a guitar at his head.\n\n\"Another night, a man came upstairs dressed entirely in black, including his hair, his beard, and his moustache.\n\n\"He wore a cape, aviator shades, a huge cross on a chain and an 'In the Flesh' button on his lapel. Phil Spector.\n\n\"He was flanked by two tall, good-looking, impeccably dressed twins who were his entourage that night.\n\n\"They ushered the Ramones and everyone out of the room, except us.\n\n\"While the glamorous twins stood by the door, keeping everyone out \u2014 or maybe keeping us in \u2014 Phil kept up a long monologue into the early hours of the morning.\n\n\"Buried somewhere within the endless ramble was an invitation to his mansion.\n\nINSIDE VAN HALEN'S HEDONISTIC PARTIES\n\n\"Phil\u2019s walled mansion was really quite close to the Strip. I remember the icy air conditioning and how very 'Phil Spector' he was. Chris remembers Phil greeting us with a Colt .45 in one hand and a bottle of Manischewitz (wine) in the other.\n\n\"There were a few other guests that night and everyone had to sit down. Phil didn\u2019t want anyone walking around.\n\n\"Then he started playing the piano. He wanted me to sit on the bench next to him and sing 'Be My Baby' and some Ronettes songs with him. He kept making me sing and sing.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t want to, because I had so many shows, but Phil was in his zone and was not to be denied.\n\n\"Then a little later, when we were sitting together on the couch, Phil took out his gun, stuck it into the top of my thigh-high leather boot, and said, 'Bang, bang!' He was a genius, he had a gun and his paranoia was enormous \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t always end well. I do find it sad he\u2019s in prison \u2014 sadder still for the poor woman he lured to his mansion then shot and killed.\n\n\"After our last Whisky show we went to San Francisco and played the Mabuhay Gardens.\n\n\"The girls were stylish and pretty, so the boys in the band had some appropriately wild times.\n\n\"I had a few wild times of my own fighting off some very aggressive women \u2014 some were after me and some were after Chris.\n\n\"And there was a wild party in an art gallery that the guys broke into \u2014 literally broke into, a brick or a cinder block through the front door.\n\n\"We were high on the energy of those few weeks in LA, everyone was walking in the footsteps of rock history \u2014 and we had a reputation to build! Next up was Blondie\u2019s first real tour. With Iggy Pop and David Bowie. We played more than 20 shows with them. Offstage, we would hang around a bit and talk, just day-to-day stuff, but it was a little different for me being the only girl there.\n\n\"I was with Chris, we were a couple, but there still isn\u2019t anything to equate to being the only woman on the road with all guys.\n\n\"One time David and Iggy were looking for some blow.\n\n\"Their connection in New York had suddenly died and they were out. A friend had given me a gram but I had barely touched it.\n\nIGGY POP ONCE PERFORMED WHILE HIGH ON ELEPHANT TRANQUILIZERS\n\n\"I didn\u2019t care for coke too much \u2014 it made me jittery and wired and it affected my throat. So I went upstairs with my vast quantity of cocaine and they just sucked it right up in one swoop.\n\n\"After they did the blow, David pulled out his c\u2014k \u2014 as if I were the official \u2014k-checker or something. Since I was in an all-male band, maybe they figured I really was the c\u2014k-check lady. David\u2019s size was notorious, of course, and he loved to pull it out with both men and women. It was so funny, adorable and sexy.\n\n\"A moment later, Chris walked into the room but the show was already over. Nothing to see. Which was kind of a relief.\n\n\"Probably the guys said, 'Oh, David and Iggy took Debbie upstairs,' and he got his testosterone in a tizzy. As Chris and I left the room, I had to wonder why Iggy didn\u2019t let me have a closer look at his d\u2014k.\n\n\"David Bowie once described the music business as a mental hospital \u2014 you\u2019d only be let out to promote something or make another record \u2014 then back in you\u2019d go. That sounds about right.\n\n\"Once Blondie became successful, the pressures of the music industry and the continuing demands for more material, more tours, more press, had taken us to pretty much our limit.\n\n\"But then you\u2019d just keep moving, like a moth drawn to the flame.\n\n\"Those times where when we came closest to real rock \u2019n\u2019 roll madness \u2014 the show we played at CBGB\u2019s before leaving on that first Iggy tour; the room so oversold that someone, probably our manager, called the fire department and I was on stage watching all these helmets and uniforms trying to wade through the crowd.\n\n\u201cThey shut us down twice but we kept on playing.\n\nTHE REAL REASON DAVID BOWIE'S EYES ARE DIFFERENT COLORS\n\n\"Then there was the in-store at Our Price records in London when there was such a mob that the cops had to block off the street.\n\n\"Or Germany, where we had fans clinging to our bus or throwing themselves in front of it.\n\n\"I would be on stage and there\u2019d be 5,000 people pulsing their desire at me. You could feel the heat of it. The raw, animal physicality.\n\n\"Feel them transmitting this strong sexuality. Picking up on it, then working to turn them on even more. And the frenzied feedback cycle would keep building and building.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"This was real.
