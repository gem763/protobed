(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nThe LGBTQ activists outside the Supreme Court were a diverse crowd.\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\n\u2018Equal justice under law\u201d reads the engraving on the front of the Supreme Court, where around 70 campaigners for women\u2019s and children\u2019s welfare (and about 700 LGBTQ activists) were gathered. Yesterday the Court heard three cases related to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Acts, which prohibits discrimination in the workplace \u201con the basis of sex.\u201d But as those in attendance know, these decisions will have further implications about whether sex is defined for legal purposes as anatomical, as observed at birth.\n\nThe day began at the northeast corner of Constitution Avenue and Second Street. Off to one side were ten people from the Westboro Baptist Church. They held placards saying, \u201cGo and sin no more\u201d and \u201cGod hates pride.\u201d Nobody was paying the slightest bit of attention to them. In the middle were a diverse bunch holding differently colored flags: Rainbows for LGBT; pink, white, and blue for trans; navy blue and yellow for the Human Rights Campaign (an enormously well-funded LGBT lobby group). Some signs:\n\nThis is what democracy looks like.\n\nThe life expectancy of a black trans woman is 35.\n\nBreak the binary.\n\nMy faith does not discriminate.\n\n\u201cHey ho! Hey ho! Donald Trump has got to go!\u201d a man in fishnets, floral shoes, and a pink kippah shouted as another a man draped in rainbows and carrying a megaphone lead the crowds in a chant:\n\nWhat do we want? Equality?\n\nWhen do we want it? Now!\n\nWhat do we want? Equality?\n\nWhen do we want it? Now!\n\nIf we don\u2019t get it \u2014 shut it down.\n\nIf we don\u2019t get it \u2014 shut it down.\n\nShut what down? I wondered. Just then, a very friendly young man in a \u201cPride\u201d T-shirt approached. I asked him what brought him out today. \u201cI\u2019m homosexual,\u201d he said. I asked what he thought of LGBT activism. He explained his theory of \u201csocial evolution.\u201d First, lesbians were excluded from the women\u2019s movement; then gays and lesbians were excluded from civil rights; now trans people are excluded from gay rights. That obviously needs to change, he said; and it obviously will. What\u2019s after trans? I asked. \u201cGood question,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n\nI asked if he thought, like Martin Luther King, that it\u2019s healthier for societies to define people by their character rather than by this or that attribute that they cannot control (e.g. sexual desires) and which aren\u2019t even that interesting. He said that this was a reasonable point of view. I asked whether he thought it is bigoted to acknowledge that a man presenting as a woman is still a man, or whether it is hateful to recognize that there are multiple contexts (e.g. prisons, sports, and public facilities) where a person\u2019s sex remains relevant even after they transition. Again, he thought that was a valid perspective. I pointed out that some people in our present company would find the views I\u2019d just expressed abominable. He seemed surprised by this. But, then, this was his first rally.\n\nWandering through the crowds I then came across a group of four 18-year-old girls. They had just started as freshmen at American University and this was also their first rally. I asked what brought them out here today. To celebrate their queer and lesbian identities and to offer support to other LGBT people! Why all the labels? \u201cBecause it gives us a name to how we\u2019re feeling,\u201d one explained. None of them knew what the cases being heard at the Supreme Court were about, but they had a vague idea. They were about discriminating against LGBT people. Which they\u2019re obviously against. How did they hear about the rally? \u201cWe found out about this event at our [college\u2019s] center of diversity,\u201d one explained. What\u2019s that? \u201cIt\u2019s a really good community for LGBTQ people and their allies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the first young man, I put the Martin Luther King idea to them. They considered it. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t hurt to respect someone else\u2019s identity,\u201d one said. I agreed but gave a handful of scenarios \u2014 real scenarios \u2014 in which overlooking a person\u2019s biological sex has hurt people, mostly women and children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know how much we can read into these kinds of one-off cases,\u201d one said. I then walked them through some of the feminist arguments about redefining sex (which they had never heard before). \u201cAre you talking about terfs?\u201d [trans-exclusive radical feminists] \u201cBecause terfs are really problematic for a number of reasons,\u201d one said. I gave an example of a \u201cterf\u201d I know, a lesbian who is not attracted to trans women because, though it\u2019s considered impolite to say, trans women are men. Is it transphobic for her not to want to date a trans woman? \u201cA woman with a penis?\u201d At this, the girls became visibly uncomfortable. \u201cOh, we\u2019re only 18,\u201d one said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know so much about the sex stuff. You\u2019d need to ask someone older.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNear a line of cops blocking the road to the Supreme Court were a handful of quiet people from \u201cthe other side.\u201d As far as I could see, only the women\u2019s-rights groups \u2014 a.k.a. the \u201cterfs\u201d \u2014 had posters and placards, though I knew for a fact that there were concerned parents and citizens standing with them. Several posters had the face of Selina Soule, the 16-year-old female athlete who shot to fame for her stand against her state\u2019s transgender sports policy (which allowed boys to compete in the girls\u2019 athletic category). Other signs read \u201c#SexNOTgender\u201d and \u201cProtect fairness for women.\u201d These attracted the attention of a nearby LGBT activist with a megaphone. She walked over to the front of the crowd and yelled through the megaphone, as close to her perceived enemies as possible: \u201cGo home homophobes!\u201d This was met with much hooting and laughter.\n\nAs I sat on a wall, waiting for the cops to move, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear a conversation between two rainbow clad men. They are talking about \u201cterfs.\u201d I turned and asked how they defined \u201cterf.\u201d \u201cA terf is a person who thinks that trans women are not women because they were assigned male at birth,\u201d one explained. The other snorted at the very idea! \u201cThey think that women can never have penises. Ever.\u201d I must have looked confused by what is so unreasonable about this belief because he continued: \u201cThey think that a trans woman\u2019s claim to womanhood is a violation of their womanhood.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked who he thought was worse \u2014 terfs or religious bigots. \u201cGood question,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is no hierarchy of bigotry.\u201d A nearby woman then explained that some feminists have even cooperated with the Heritage Foundation \u2014 the greatest of right-wing bogeymen \u2014 where (I neglected to tell them) I was speaking the next day.", "description": "The Court heard three cases related to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Acts, which prohibits discrimination in the workplace \u201con the basis of sex.\u201d", "authors": ["Madeleine Kearns", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Rich Lowry", "Kevin D.
