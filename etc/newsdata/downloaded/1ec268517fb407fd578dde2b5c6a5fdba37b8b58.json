Asked by Pirro whether Yovanovitch would \u201ckeep her job\u201d or \u201cwill you fire her,\u201d Trump initially wavered, claiming he had no idea what her testimony included.\n\nBut he wouldn\u2019t rule out the possibility of her getting axed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know very much about her. I know that supposedly she was very partisan, and she was a Clinton-type person, but whether or not she keeps the job, I\u2019d leave that up to Mike Pompeo,\u201d he said.\n\nHe went on to insist that he knows nothing about Yovanovitch, who in fact \u201cmay be a very fine person,\u201d despite having disparaged her in the same phone conversation with the Ukrainian president that is now at the center of an impeachment inquiry against him.\n\nTrump and his personal attorney are accused of using backchannels and shadow diplomacy in Ukraine to both target Trump\u2019s biggest potential political rival in 2020, former vice president Joe Biden, and try to legitimize claims that pro-Clinton Ukrainian officials conspired against Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nYovanovitch\u2019s ouster is at the center of those efforts, as she has reportedly said she was sidelined to clear the way for Giuliani\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukrainian officials.\n\nTrump claimed it was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky who took issue with the ambassador.\n\n\u201cBut even if you listen to the very good conversation that I had \u2014 a very, very good, no pressure, congenial conversation with the new president of Ukraine \u2014 he had some things that were not flattering to say about her. And that came out of the blue,\u201d he told Pirro.\n\nAccording to the White House\u2019s own readout of Trump\u2019s July 25th call with Zelensky, however, it was Trump who first criticized Yovanovitch, telling Zelensky he just wanted to \u201clet him know\u201d that Yovanovitch, at that point already the former ambassador, was \u201cbad news.\u201d Zelensky, who appeared desperate to please throughout the phone call, told Trump he agreed with him.\n\nYovanovitch was unexpectedly forced out of her post in May, months ahead of schedule, at the height of Giuliani\u2019s endeavors to have Ukrainian authorities pursue investigations into widely debunked corruption allegations against Biden.\n\nGiuliani has admitted that he reminded Trump ahead of Yovanovitch's removal that she was not loyal to him and complained to the president that she was hindering efforts to have the Bidens investigated. Trump reportedly ordered her out after those complaints.", "description": "He claims he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow very much\u201d about the ex-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who testified that he forced her out. But he told Ukraine\u2019s president she was \u201cbad news\u201d back in July.", "authors": ["Allison Quinn", "News Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2350,w_4178,x_0,y_121/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570940830/RTS2QTCU_ea5zzo", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
