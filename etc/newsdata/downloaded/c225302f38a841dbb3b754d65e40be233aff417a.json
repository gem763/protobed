The Solo Pro are the official followup to the Solo 3, a branding shift that\u2019s in line with its other technologies.\n\nThe noise canceling is the same introduced with the Studio over-ear line, way back in 2017. It\u2019s adaptive technology, meaning that rather being tuned to a specific sound like, say, an airplane drone, an array of microphones listen for ambient sound and adjust accordingly.\n\nI was pretty impressed in the case of the Studio line and expect much of the same here. There\u2019s also an on-board button for Transparency, which lets in ambient noise for those times when you need to hear what\u2019s around you. Beats being an Apple company, the microphones are also optimized for Siri use, while the W1 and H1 chips mean quick syncing to iOS products, along with the new audio sharing.\n\nBeats says the headphones should last \u201cup to 22 hours\u201d with either active noise canceling or Transparency on and \u201cup to 40 hours\u201d with them shut off. I might have to test them out on my upcoming trip to Asia. They\u2019re charged up via Lightning \u2014 kind of a bummer, but Apple. A 10-minute charge should get you up to three hours of playback.\n\nThey arrive October 30, priced at $300.", "description": "Beats this morning announced that it will be bringing its excellent noise-cancellation technology to its Solo line of on-ear headphones.
