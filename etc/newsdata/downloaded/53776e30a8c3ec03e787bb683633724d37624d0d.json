But mortgage giant Freddie Mac notes that 30-year fixed mortgage rates have remained under 3.6% for four straight weeks \u2014 and it's the first time we've seen that kind of string since the fall of 2016.\n\nBorrowers are noticing and have been blazing their way through mortgage applications.\n\nIf you spot a good rate and are shopping for a house or could benefit from a refinance, you may want to lock that rate now.\n\nThis week's numbers\n\nAndrey_Popov / Shutterstock\n\nHomeowners who refinance are finding they can save about $140 a month, on average.\n\nMore\n\nThe average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has gone up this week to 3.56%, from 3.49% last week, says Freddie Mac.\n\nThe loans in the survey come with an average 0.5 point.\n\nOne year ago, the benchmark mortgage rate was more than a full percentage point higher, averaging 4.6%.\n\nRates have fallen so far that it might be worth your while to refinance an existing home loan, even if it's just a year old. Take a look at today's best rates where you are.\n\nFreddie Mac said recently that homeowners who refinanced in the spring are saving an average of $1,700 a year, or about $140 a month.\n\nRefinance activity is up 169% from a year ago, says the Mortgage Bankers Association. Refi applications edged up 0.4% last week, and mortgage applications overall were up 2%.\n\nWhy rates are doing what they're doing\n\nMonkey Business Images / Shutterstock\n\nLow mortgage rates are making it very easy for agents to sell homes.\n\nMore\n\nLow interest rates are helping to keep the market for homes humming, says Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist.\n\n\"The improved demand reflects the still healthy underlying consumer economic fundamentals such as a low unemployment rate, solid wage growth and low mortgage rates,\" Khater says.\n\nPeople shopping for houses have not gotten rattled by trouble signs for the economy, such as weakness in U.S. manufacturing, and all of the uncertainty over tariffs and trade, he adds.\n\nMortgage rates are likely to stay down and continue bolstering home sales going into next year. Freddie Mac's current forecast looks for rates to remain in the neighborhood of 3.6% through the first half of 2020.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to do its part to keep borrowing costs down. Central bankers meet next week, and the widely followed CME FedWatch forecasting tool shows a high probability that the officials will cut interest rates again.\n\nStory continues", "description": "We've had an extended run of reduced rates like we haven't seen in a long time.", "authors": ["Doug Whiteman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HXo5fhD5wk4ZlWDwxBE65Q--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/moneywise_327/bb185e9ab0a51199d666e1b8cdf06f4c", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
