Strauss died in 2005, so answers must come from decades-old records, the 300-plus accusers , former colleagues and others who knew him.\n\nThe State Medical Board of Ohio is reviewing whether any licensed doctors violated a duty to report concerns about Strauss. If so, they could face discipline from the board, though the window for criminal prosecution of that has passed.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge said men suing the university over Strauss\u2018 misconduct can pursue sworn statements from ex-employees who didn\u2019t cooperate with the investigation conducted for Ohio State by the law firm Perkins Coie.\n\n\u201cThese are highly significant witnesses with substantial knowledge about Dr. Strauss and OSU\u2019s response to Dr. Strauss, and we look forward to getting their testimony under oath as we seek justice for OSU survivors,\u201d said Ilann Maazel, an attorney for some of the men who say they were abused by Strauss.\n\nThe number of accusers has grown since 177 men provided firsthand accounts of sexual abuse for the OSU investigation. Their allegations span 1979 to 1997, nearly Strauss\u2018 entire career there, and included his work with athletes and at the student health center and his off-campus clinic.\n\nWith the lawsuits in mediation toward a potential settlement , the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers argue information from the \u201cnon-cooperative\u201d witnesses could bolster survivors\u2019 claims about Ohio State\u2019s failure to stop abuse by Strauss.\n\nThe university, which has publicly apologized for its failure to stop Strauss, unsuccessfully argued those depositions aren\u2019t necessary for mediation.\n\nThe Perkins Coie investigation identified at least six \u201cnon-cooperative\u201d witnesses, including two Ohio State doctors who dealt with complaints about Strauss in the mid-1990s: former student health director Ted Grace, who now has a similar role at Southern Illinois University, and former head team physician John Lombardo, who also was then and remains the NFL\u2019s adviser on performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nGrace cut off Strauss\u2018 work with the Student Health Men\u2019s Clinic after a student complained about being fondled during an exam in January 1996, about a year after two other male patients complained about Strauss. The second of the three who complained, Steve Snyder-Hill, alleges Grace mishandled the situation by having him subsequently meet with Strauss to discuss it and lied to him by telling him there had been no previous complaints about Strauss.\n\nGrace didn\u2019t respond to messages from the AP but told The Southern Illinoisan newspaper that he didn\u2019t intend to mislead Snyder-Hill, \u201cdid the best I could\u201d in a difficult situation and is \u201cthe only one who did anything at all.\u201d\n\nGrace told the paper he provided records about Strauss for an investigation by the State Medical Board of Ohio but didn\u2019t think he was required to report the adult patients\u2019 complaints to police.\n\nGrace declined to be interviewed for the Perkins Coie investigation because Ohio State wouldn\u2019t cover any resulting legal fees, but he told the newspaper he\u2019d welcome an opportunity to testify about what happened.\n\nThe investigators also unsuccessfully sought to interview another student health physician from that era, as well as Grace\u2019s predecessor.\n\nStrauss was never disciplined by the medical board, which, ironically, started investigating Strauss in 1996 after he first complained to the board about Grace. A recent state review found that credible evidence against Strauss was ignored in that 1996 investigation, but it couldn\u2019t determine why.\n\nA now-deceased fencing coach had raised concerns at Ohio State about her male athletes\u2019 discomfort with Strauss even earlier, in 1994. Lombardo, then the university\u2019s lead athletics physician, wrote that he investigated, talked about the issue with Strauss and concluded it was based on years of unfounded rumors, according to Perkins Coie\u2019s investigation report .\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what steps Lombardo took to investigate back then, because no evidence of that was found and he declined a voluntary interview with Perkins Coie. Lombardo didn\u2019t respond to a phone message from The Associated Press.\n\nThe fencers\u2019 subsequent physician didn\u2019t respond to investigators\u2019 interview requests and questions from AP.\n\nAn Ohio State physician and retired professor who worked with Strauss in the early 1980s to study wrestlers also declined to be interviewed by Perkins Coie. He didn\u2019t respond to email and phone messages from AP.\n\n___\n\nFollow Franko on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/kantele10 .
