He has a real sense of relief that George Pell is behind bars tonight,\" Lisa Flynn told AFP news agency.\n\nThe three judges also unanimously dismissed two so-called \"fallback\" arguments for Pell related to alleged procedural errors during his trial.\n\nHis lawyers argued they should have been allowed to show an animated reconstruction of peoples' movements in the cathedral on the days of the assaults.\n\nThey also took issue with the fact that Pell was not arraigned in the presence of the jury. The process was completed via video link so the large pool of potential jurors was able to watch.\n\nPell had already faced two juries, after his first trial in 2018 ended in a hung jury.\n\nFollowing Wednesday's ruling Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed sympathy for the victims.\n\nHe said the \"courts had done their job\" and indicated Pell would be stripped of his Order of Australia honour.\n\nDuring Pell's trial under the court-ordered veil of secrecy, the Vatican gradually removed him from top Church bodies with little explanation.\n\nShortly after his conviction, Pell was removed from the so-called C9 Council of Cardinals that are effectively the Pope's cabinet and inner circle of advisers.\n\nThe Vatican dropped him as the Church's finance chief and opened its own probe into his actions after his conviction was made public in February.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
