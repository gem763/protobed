This regime has failed to lead Lebanon and it must be toppled and replaced,\u201d said Mohammad Awada, 32, who is unemployed.\n\nPrime minister Hariri gave his government partners a 72-hour deadline on Friday to agree on reforms that could ward off economic crisis, hinting he may otherwise resign.\n\nIn a televised speech addressing the protests on Saturday, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the group was against the government resigning, and the country did not have enough time for such a move given the acute financial crisis.\n\n\u201cEveryone should take responsibility rather than being preoccupied with settling political scores while leaving the fate of the country unknown,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll of us have to shoulder the responsibility of the current situation that we arrived at,\u201d added Nasrallah, whose Iranian-backed Shi\u2019ite group is Lebanon\u2019s most influential.\n\nDemonstrators carry national flags during an anti-government protest in the port city of Sidon, Lebanon October 19, 2019.

They prevented TV crews from filming the protests.\n\nIn the speech, Nasrallah predicted that imposing more taxes would lead to an \u201cexplosion\u201d of unrest.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t work towards a solution we\u2019re heading towards a collapse of the country, it will be bankrupt and our currency will not have any value,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe second danger is a popular explosion as a result of wrong handling of the situation.\u201d\n\nProtesters from across the political spectrum filled the streets.\n\n\u201cI am taking part because over the last 30 years warlords have been ruling us. I am about to be 30 and my parents still tell me tomorrow will be better. I am not seeing better days ahead,\u201d said Sylvia Yaqoub, 29, a laboratory manager.\n\n\u201cWe want back the money they stole because 30 families are ruling five million people. We won\u2019t accept this any longer.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nFadi Dhaher, 21, a university student, said his generation felt they had no future. \u201cWe are protesting because we don\u2019t want to emigrate ... they are pushing us to leave our country.\u201d\n\nGovernment sources said the cabinet might hold an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss a way out of the crisis.\n\nThe budget could help it unlock billions of dollars pledged by international donors who have made their support conditional on long-delayed reforms to curb waste and corruption.", "description": "Tens of thousands took to the streets of Lebanon on Saturday for a third day of anti-government protests, directing growing rage at a political elite they blame for entrenched cronyism and driving the country to the economic brink.", "authors": ["Laila Bassam", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442691680&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0DU", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
