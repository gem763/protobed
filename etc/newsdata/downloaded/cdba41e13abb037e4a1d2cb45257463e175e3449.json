It is unclear whether the EFL are also looking into Chirivella\u2019s involvement in the second competition.", "description": "Liverpool\u00a0face the prospect of being expelled from this season\u2019s\u00a0EFL Cup after fielding an ineligible player in their third round victory at Milton Keynes Dons.
