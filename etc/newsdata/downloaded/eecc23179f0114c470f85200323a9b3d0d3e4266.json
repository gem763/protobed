Guyer had been engaged in an off-and-on sexual relationship with Rivera, the Dallas Morning News reports.\n\nIn fact, Guyger was reportedly on the phone with Rivera when she pulled into her complex\u2019s parking garage just a few minutes before she entered Jean\u2019s apartment.\n\nCop Who Killed Neighbor in His Home Was Allegedly Distracted by Sexually Explicit Calls, Texts More\n\nOn Sept. 6, 2018, Guyger, 31, parked her vehicle on the fourth floor of her apartment building after working a 13-hour shift at the Dallas Police Department. Still in uniform, she walked into Jean\u2019s apartment instead of her own. She claims she did not realize she had entered the wrong apartment and that she mistook Jean for an intruder before shooting at him twice, striking Jean once in the chest.\n\nJean worked as an accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers and originally hailed from Saint Lucia. He was a graduate of Arkansas\u2019 Harding University, his family told CNN.\n\nRELATED: Murder Trial Begins for Off-Duty Cop Who Shot, Killed Man Inside His Apartment\n\nGuyger was charged with murder and pleaded not guilty.

Rogers during his opening statement at the Dallas County Court House. \u201cIt was a perfect storm of innocent circumstances that all came together \u2026 that led to this tragedy.\u201d\n\nBut the county\u2019s assistant district attorney argued that Guyger never gave Jean a chance to explain.\n\n\u201cAmber Guyger comes through his front door uninvited,\u201d says prosecutor Jason Hermus. \u201cThere was no opportunity for de-escalation, no opportunity for him to surrender.
