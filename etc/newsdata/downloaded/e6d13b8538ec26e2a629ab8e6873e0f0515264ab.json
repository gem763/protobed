I think both sides are needing to have a win,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, at OANDA in New York.\n\n\"So there is less safe-haven demand for the dollar. If we get some type of trade deal or mini-agreement or mandate, you're going to see that being supportive of European assets. We're seeing the euro now back above $1.10, which has been the resistance,\" he added.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He said on Thursday China is willing to reach an agreement with the United States on matters that both sides care about so as to prevent friction from leading to any further escalation, the state news agency Xinhua reported.

The euro was last at $1.1017, up 0.4%, as hedge funds cut back their extreme short bets.\n\nAgainst the safe-haven yen, however, the dollar was last up 0.4% at 107.87 yen .\n\nThe dollar was little moved after data showed U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in September and underlying inflation slipped.
