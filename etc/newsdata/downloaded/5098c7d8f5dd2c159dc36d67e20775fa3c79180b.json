This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the president\u2019s main domestic political rivals.\u201d\n\nAs Maguire appeared before the lawmakers, networks were faced with covering the drama of the hearing but at the same time the revelations from the release of the complaint. CNN\u2019s banner read: \u201cWhistleblower: Trump tried to get Ukraine to interfere in election, and White House tried to cover it up.\u201d CNN, Fox News and MSNBC also included a chyron message directing viewers to their websites to read the complaint.\n\nAt the hearing, Democrats grilled Maguire about why he initially withheld the whistleblower\u2019s complaint from Congress, as is required by law.\n\nMaguire defended his decision to not immediately turn over the whistleblower\u2019s complaint to Congress, citing an exception for executive privilege. But he also was careful not to delve into thornier issues of whether the claims of the whistleblower had credibility. He said that he thinks that \u201cthe whistleblower did the right thing. He followed the law every step of the way.\u201d\n\nSome of the Republicans on the committee fixated on the fact that the whistleblower was not a witness to Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but based the complaint on colleagues\u2019 accounts of what happened.\n\nYet Maguire agreed that the whistleblower\u2019s details of the Trump-Zelensky conversation mirror those in the transcript memo released by the White House on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI would say that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint is in alignment with what was released by the president yesterday,\u201d Maguire said.\n\nMuch of the hearing was devoted to complex legal issues of how Maguire handled the whistleblower complaint after receiving it in August \u2014 and less so on the substance of the complaint itself.\n\nStill, the networks stayed on coverage throughout, a signal of the type of attention they will devote to the impeachment inquiry. ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, CNN en Espanol, Fox News Channel, MSNBC and C-SPAN were among those that carried it live. The local Fox affiliate in Los Angeles did not.\n\nOther highlights of the hearing: Maguire testified that he shared the complaint with the Justice Department in making the determination that it did not meet the threshold of being \u201curgent,\u201d triggering the need for its immediate release to Congress. He also said that he shared it with the White House\u2019s office of legal counsel in determining that it involved issues of executive privilege, given that it dealt with the substance of Trump\u2019s call with a foreign leader.\n\nThe hearing also put the spotlight on Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who said that \u201cwhat you saw on this committee is democracy, as ugly as it can be, as personal as it can be.\u201d\n\nAt the start of the hearing, Schiff gave his interpretation of the call as a \u201cclassic organized crime shakedown,\u201d reciting line-by-line what he thought Trump was trying to convey.\n\n\u201cThis is some in character what the president was trying to communicate,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIt would be funny if it wasn\u2019t such a graphic betrayal of the president\u2019s Oath of Office.\u201d", "description": "The broadcast and cable networks gave a glimpse of what is in store for the House impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, as they devoted live coverage of Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire's testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.
