In July, tourist arrivals had fallen 5% from a year ago.\n\nVisitors and shoppers are getting caught up in the clashes, which have sometimes turned violent, quickly move between districts and have shut subway stations for hours at a time. Bystanders are being exposed to tear gas and fire bombs.\n\nMonths of protests combined with the U.S.-China trade dispute and slowing Chinese growth are threatening to tip Hong Kong\u2019s economy into recession, officials have warned.\n\nThis past weekend\u2019s demonstrations signal that recent moves by the government\u2014including withdrawing a bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China for trial\u2014have failed to quell the city\u2019s protest movement. On Monday, hundreds of students formed human chains throughout Hong Kong before school started in a show of solidarity with the protesters.\n\n\u201cThe social events of the past few months\u2014especially the continuous violent activities, blockage of airport and roads\u2014have severely damaged Hong Kong\u2019s image as a safe city, and a trade, aviation and financial hub,\u201d said Mr. Chan, the financial secretary, in a blog post published Sunday. \u201cIt has also hit the local economy, with impact on the travel, retail and hospitality sectors being the most severe.\u201d\n\nMr. Chan added, \u201cThe most worrying thing is that the outlook is not likely to turn around in the near future.\u201d\n\nTourism, retail and hotel bookings have directly suffered, he said, and several meetings and business trips have either been postponed or moved to other locations. In some districts, hotel occupancy rates dropped by more than half, while prices have fallen by as much as 70%, he said.\n\nFor instance, Ecco, a Danish shoe maker and retailer, was previously scheduled to have a companywide training course in Hong Kong in November, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company has since moved the course to Thailand, the person said. A company spokeswoman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe tourism industry is a pillar of Hong Kong\u2019s economy, contributing around 5% of Hong Kong\u2019s gross domestic product in 2016 and employing more than 250,000 people.\n\nStudents formed human chains throughout Hong Kong on Monday.

But reports of violent clashes between police and demonstrators made him cancel their trip.\n\n\u201cWe decided it was too great a risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted a peaceful getaway, not tear gas and water cannons.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson went to middle school in Hong Kong and said he was eager to show his girlfriend the city that shaped him.\n\n\u201cI keep telling her, \u2018This is not the Hong Kong that I remember.\u2019 The images I see today make me sad.\u201d\n\nThe protests have rippled through the economy in various ways. Retail sales and consumer spending have fallen. Long lines outside restaurants frequented by tourists have recently disappeared.\n\nHousing prices have dropped and the stock market has declined. Fitch Ratings downgraded Hong Kong\u2019s credit rating on Friday, saying the unrest has tested the city\u2019s relationship with mainland China and hurt its reputation.\n\nA survey of private businesses published last week by IHS Markit showed purchasing activity in Hong Kong fell to the lowest level in the 21-year history of the series.\n\nEvents have suffered too. A spokesman for the Hong Kong Watch and Clock Fair, an annual industry gathering that bills itself as the world\u2019s largest watch fair, said there were 18,000 attendees at last week\u2019s trade show, a seven-year low and down about 15% from a year ago.\n\nWilliam Shum, founder and chief executive of Memorigin, a nine-year-old local luxury watch brand, said his sales in Hong Kong have dropped by about 50% during the protests. He attributed the decline to fewer tourists, particularly those from mainland China who typically account for a large percentage of sales for his high-end watches.\n\nMr. Shum said this has been the worst slowdown in Hong Kong sales he has seen. The drop has prompted him to consider more opportunities overseas\u2014including Japan, where he has recently seen a pickup in demand.\n\n\u201cHong Kong has played an important role for international trading for a long time, but with the protests, foreign clients have stopped coming,\u201d Mr. Shum said.\n\n\u2014Cl\u00e9ment B\u00fcrge contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com and Preetika Rana at preetika.rana@wsj.com", "description": "The number of tourists visiting the city suffered one of the biggest drops on record in August, one of the clearest indications that months of antigovernment protests are decimating parts of the local economy.", "authors": ["Steven Russolillo", "Preetika Rana", "Steven.Russolillo Wsj.Com", "Preetika.Rana Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105188/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
