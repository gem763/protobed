Nine sectors including electronics, autos, pharmaceuticals and telecoms will be targeted.\n\nThe move to scrap the tax on open cell panels is a step in the right direction, said Vikas Agarwal, the India head of OnePlus, a Chinese firm known for high-end Android smartphones.\n\n\u201cTV is the next big focus for us. Any incentives or benefits are good for us,\u201d said Agarwal, whose firm is seen making a foray into television sales in the country.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s decision would also provide respite to local TV manufacturers, which have been hit by cheap imports from Vietnam, said Manish Sharma, CEO of Panasonic India, the fourth biggest TV manufacturer in India.\n\n\u201cThe move will allow us to pass the (cost) benefits to the end-consumer, which would mean an about 3-4% reduction in price, thus providing the necessary thrust to the market,\u201d he said.", "description": "India has scrapped a tax on imports of open cell TV panels, used to make television displays, in a move likely to boost television manufacturing in the country and counter incentives offered by nations such as Vietnam.", "authors": ["Sankalp Phartiyal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
