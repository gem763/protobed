He claims China called him. No one can confirm. And Trump won't talk about it.\n\nAsked later in the day to clarify whom the calls were with, Mr. Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about calls. We\u2019ve had calls. We\u2019ve had calls at the highest levels.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative didn\u2019t respond to questions about when the call took place and between whom.\n\nIn softening his rhetoric, Mr. Trump also sowed some confusion. Mr. Trump said China had called U.S. officials on the previous evening and said \u201clet\u2019s get back to the table.\u201d The spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, said he was \u201cnot aware of\u201d such a phone call by China to the U.S.\n\nMr. Trump on Monday said the U.S. negotiations with China were \u201cmuch more meaningful than at any time.\u201d Asked if he would consider delaying or canceling planned tariffs on China, he replied: \u201cAnything\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n4-D Chess Not\n\nDoes anybody remotely believe the above synopsis as describe by Trump?\n\nIt's not 4-D chess, nor 3-D chess, nor any kind of chess as I have commented numerous times.\n\nTom Luongo has an excellent writeup on the subject.\n\nPlease consider Trump's Not A 4-D Chess-Player, He's A Very Simple Creature\n\nIf you listen to Trump carefully, seeing him for what he is not what you think he is, what you want him to be or, most importantly, what he wants you to see, you hear a man who fully believes the Fed controls the economy.\n\nYou hear a man that firmly believes in the power of the government to remake the world in whatever image it wants, whenever it wants. You hear a man so solipsistic he can only see the world in terms he defined more than thirty years ago.\n\nYou hear a man who fundamentally doesn\u2019t believe trade results in both sides winning but that everyone either wins a deal or loses. If he didn\u2019t extract maximum pain from the other side he \u2018lost.\u2019 It\u2019s the source of Trump\u2019s inherent mercantilism.\n\nAnd that fault in Donald Trump\u2019s character is leading him to ever more extreme behavior as he refuses to reconcile the world we have versus the world he wants. So he keeps pressuring, embarrassing and humiliating people he wants to make deals with. And when they refuse to do so, he explodes and, like a child who didn\u2019t get his cookie, uses the power of the Presidency to still try to get what he wants.\n\nTrump\u2019s not a multi-dimensional analyst. He isn\u2019t a 4-d chess player. He\u2019s actually a very simple creature. He believes the crap spewed by CNBC. He\u2019s hired advisers who worked there for pity\u2019s sake.", "description": "Trump eased back on China this morning.
