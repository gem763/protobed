Prices for the line range from $39.50 to $2,998.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn animal-print jacket from Ralph Lauren's \"Friends\" collection.\n\nWhile Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Joey and Phoebe might not have been able to afford to shop the looks, the actors who played them likely could. \"Friends\" stars got paid $1 million an episode (or $22 million per season) on the show back in 2002.\n\nThe show continues to cash in years after it first aired in 1994. Warner Bros. TV debuted a \"Friends\" pop-up experience in New York City earlier this month with set re-creations, props and costumes used in the series. Tickets are priced at $29.50 each.\n\nRalph Lauren's line will be available at Bloomingdale\u2019s in New York City on Sept. 21 and Sept. 22. A section of the store has been transformed into the \u201cFriends\u201d famous coffee shop, Central Perk, where shoppers will get the ultimate fan experience.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Ralph Lauren's \"Friends\" collection pays homage to the sitcom's 25th anniversary with chic, Rachel-inspired looks.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/ralph-lauren-friends.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
