Walmart expects its share of ammunition sales to drop to between 6% and 9% as a result of the newly announced changes. The company will continue to sell the shotguns and rifles that it carries.\n\n\"We are trying to take constructive steps to reduce the risk that events like these will happen again,\" McMillon said.\n\nIf you work at Walmart and have opinions or experiences to share, email this author at hpeterson@businessinsider.com.\n\nMcMillon also said he sent letters to the White House and Congress encouraging debate around stronger gun-control measures.\n\n\"We encourage our nation's leaders to move forward and strengthen background checks and to remove weapons from those who have been determined to pose an imminent danger,\" McMillon said. \"We do not sell military-style rifles, and we believe the reauthorization of the Assault Weapons ban should be debated to determine its effectiveness.\"\n\nWalmart asks shoppers to stop openly carrying guns into its stores\n\nMcMillon said the company was \"respectfully requesting\" that shoppers stop openly carrying firearms into its stores because of a string of recent incidents involving gun-carrying shoppers that caused store evacuations. The policy change won't affect shoppers carrying concealed firearms.\n\nRead more: 'Customers no longer feel as safe': Walmart employee emails petition protesting gun sales to CEO Doug McMillon\n\n\"There have been multiple incidents since El Paso where individuals attempting to make a statement and test our response have entered our stores carrying weapons in a way that frightened or concerned our associates and customers,\" McMillon said. \"These incidents are concerning and we would like to avoid them, so we are respectfully requesting that customers no longer openly carry firearms into our stores or Sam's Clubs in states where 'open carry' is permitted \u2014 unless they are authorized law enforcement officers.\"\n\nGoing forward, Walmart store managers will have the discretion to decide how to handle situations where shoppers openly carry guns inside stores, a Walmart spokesman told Business Insider.\n\nStore managers may ask a shopper openly carrying a gun into their store to leave and safely secure their firearm in their vehicle before returning. The policies will vary by location, however, and shoppers who are openly carrying guns may not always be asked to leave the store, the spokesman said.\n\nRead more: Walmart: 'It's time' for Congress to debate an assault-weapons ban\n\nIn closing out the memo, McMillon said he owned a gun and that Walmart remained committed to its \"long heritage\" of \"serving responsible hunters and sportsmen and women.\"\n\n\"My family raised bird dogs when I was growing up in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and I'm a gun owner myself,\" he wrote. \"We understand that heritage, our deeply rooted place in America and our influence as the world's largest retailer. And we understand the responsibility that comes with it.\"\n\nRead McMillon's full memo:", "description": "Walmart says the changes to its firearm policies will roughly halve its share of ammunition sales in the US.", "authors": ["Hayley Peterson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d5ce5b3cd97840db4720d22-1536-768.jpg"}
