U.S. West Texas\n\nIntermediate crude fell 86 cents to $54.95.\n\n\"Doubts about OPEC+\" are weighing on prices, said\n\nCommerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch, referring to the future of\n\na supply-cutting pact between the Organization of the Petroleum\n\nExporting Countries and other nations including Russia.\n\nBrent has gained 13% in 2019, supported by the OPEC+ deal,\n\nwhich for now calls for a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per\n\nday until March. The producers meet on Dec. 5-6 to decide\n\nwhether to extend or adjust the pact.\n\nWhile OPEC officials have said a deeper supply cut is an\n\noption, news agency TASS on Monday cited Russian Deputy Energy\n\nMinister Pavel Sorokin as saying such talk was premature.\n\nLast week, Brent rose more than 4%, supported by a drop in\n\nU.S. inventories and signs of an easing in the U.S.-China trade\n\ndispute. Hopes of progress are now fading, some analysts said.\n\n\"A cautious market sentiment remains in place, with optimism\n\nfrom last week's progress on a China-U.S. trade deal ebbing\n\naway,\" JBC Energy said in a report.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to reduce interest\n\nrates when it concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nInvestors will be watching for any indication that further cuts\n\nare likely. \"Brent found resistance around $62 but that may prove\n\ntemporary if trade headlines continue to improve and central\n\nbanks keep slashing interest rates,\" said Craig Erlam, an\n\nanalyst at broker OANDA.\n\nBP Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary was cautious on the\n\noutlook for prices, telling Reuters on Tuesday Brent was \"finely\n\nbalanced\" at around $60 with more downside than upside risk\n\nafter BP reported a fall in profit. After the API report, attention will focus on official\n\ninventory figures from the U.S. Energy Information\n\nAdministration due on Wednesday.
