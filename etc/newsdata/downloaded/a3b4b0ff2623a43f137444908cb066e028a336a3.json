He joins Stefani's beau, Blake Shelton, John Legend and Kelly Clarkson.\n\nInstead, Stefani, 50, will focus on the final dates of her \"Just a Girl\" Las Vegas residency at Planet Hollywood's Zappos Theater in February and May 2020.\n\nGWEN STEFANI DIDN'T KNOW WHO BOYFRIEND BLAKE SHELTON WAS BEFORE 'THE VOICE'\n\n\"I didn't expect to be doing [the Vegas show] and 'The Voice' at the same time,\" the singer told Entertainment Tonight. \"I just feel like I'm alive in a way I've never been before, because I have to be! Because doing both is a lot.\"\n\nIn addition to her Las Vegas residency, Stefani, who just rang in the big 5-0, has another reason to celebrate.\n\nShe and fellow coach Shelton, 43, are reaching a milestone in their relationship: four years of dating.\n\nThe couple first met on the set of \"The Voice\" in 2014 and sparks quickly flew.\n\nBLAKE SHELTON IN NO RUSH TO MARRY GWEN STEFANI, 'CAN'T IMAGINE' WORKING ON 'THE VOICE' WITHOUT ADAM LEVINE\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually shocking that it has already been that long,\u201d Shelton admitted to People in June. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a blur. It still feels like it\u2019s pretty new to me. I guess it is, relatively. Four years isn\u2019t forever, but man, it seems like it just happened in no time.\u201d", "description": "Gwen Stefani announced she will not be returning as a coach for Season 18 of \"The Voice.\"", "authors": ["Sasha Savitsky", "You Can Find Sasha Savitsky On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/gwen-stefani-the-voice-nbc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
