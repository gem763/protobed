The Foreign Office has held only one meeting with the Dunn family since the accident on 27 August, Tim Dunn told LBC on Friday morning.\n\nThe judicial review will also examine the US-UK exchange of notes dating back to 1995 that, according to the FCO, waived diplomatic immunity for staff at RAF Croughton base but not for their spouses \u2013 an apparently untested arrangement that the FCO has admitted is anomalous. Sacoolas was married to Jonathan Sacoolas, who worked at the base.\n\nThe family has also referred Northamptonshire police to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) over its role in allowing Sacoolas to leave the country. The police have insisted it would not in retrospect do anything differently.\n\nFinally, the family are trying to launch civil proceedings against Sacoolas in a US court. A lawyer for the Dunn family, Radd Seiger, is due to travel to the US to discuss such an action with lawyers. He is being advised by two leading human rights lawyers, Geoffrey Robertson and Mark Stephens.\n\nSeiger said: \u201cWe did not want to get this legal ball rolling. It\u2019s absolutely clear that Ms Sacoolas was involved in a very serious collision that ended in the loss of Harry\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cWe are clear she\u2019s admitted her culpability, that she \u2026 committed a very serious crime that night.\n\n\u201cAt the very least careless, causing death by careless driving, and at the worst causing death by dangerous driving. She is a fugitive from this country and she is on the run.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to her to come back to this country and face the music.\u201d\n\nHarry Dunn death: a timeline of key events Read more\n\nSeparately, Northamptonshire police has applied for visas to travel to the US to see if they can meet Sacoolas, interview her under caution and persuade her to return to the UK to face a police investigation.\n\nShe has expressed deep remorse at Harry Dunn\u2019s death, but insisted she will not return, leaving Tim Dunn to claim that Northamptonshire police\u2019s trip to the US was \u201clittle more than a PR stunt\u201d.\n\nThe US state department has said diplomatic immunity is \u201cno longer pertinent\u201d now that she is back in the US, but has not said whether it intends to allow a prosecution in the US.\n\nAn extraordinary effort by President Donald Trump to engineer a reconciliation meeting between the Dunn family and Sacoolas in the White House ended in failure after they rejected Trump\u2019s attempt.\n\nAn FCO spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have done everything we can properly to clear a path so that justice can be done for Harry\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cAs the foreign secretary set out in parliament, the individual involved had diplomatic immunity whilst in the country under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.\u201d", "description": "Family says efforts to persuade Anne Sacoolas to return to UK have reached \u2018end of the road\u2019", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a28968f32ed31624467aa00b3997cde452b25dc/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bc294eb5dd65dc9b52d6d08c52d95104", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
