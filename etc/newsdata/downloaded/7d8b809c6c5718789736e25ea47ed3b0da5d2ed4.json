It\u2019s a fascinating examination at the business contortions required to secure funding for an ambitious literary adaptation \u2014 to say nothing of the challenges of adapting a doorstopper-sized novel into something manageable for cinematic audiences.\n\nUnfortunately, the account of making The Goldfinch may prove more compelling than the film itself. As of this writing, it currently scores 25 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Metacritic\u2019s score for it is slightly better \u2014 but 41 is hardly the stuff of universal acclaim. And yet Tartt\u2019s novel was a massive commercial and critical success. Nothing about it, save perhaps its size, suggests that it would be difficult to film: there are numerous sequences that lend themselves to a cinematic treatment, a host of memorable characters, and a globetrotting narrative.\n\nIf the film of The Goldfinch does end up filed under \u201cgood ideas, bad execution,\u201d it won\u2019t be alone. Annie Proulx\u2019s The Shipping News \u2014 winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award \u2014 was adapted in 2001 with an all-star cast, toplined by an arguably miscast Kevin Spacey. The film arrived to middling reviews and mediocre business. Two of Philip Roth\u2019s late-career masterpieces, PEN/Faulkner Award-winner The Human Stain and Pulitzer Prize-winner American Pastoral, were adapted for the big screen and received similar fates.\n\nTo be fair, a \u201cmeh\u201d reaction still seems preferable to the fates of some other high-profile book-to-film adaptations. Ron Rash\u2019s novel Serena \u2014 a finalist for the 2009 PEN/Faulkner Award \u2014 is about a woman whose ambition and determination lead to a series of harrowing and blood-soaked events, all set against a sweeping historical backdrop. Director Susanne Bier\u2019s 2014 adaptation had as its leads Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper \u2014 their third onscreen pairing after Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle. And the film arrived with a thud. Writing for Vulture, Adam Sternbergh observed, \u201cUnlike more famous movie disasters, it plays out not like the product of one unchecked monstrous ego but of a thousand tiny decisions gone wrong.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side of that, there\u2019s Brian De Palma\u2019s infamous 1990 adaption of Tom Wolfe\u2019s satirical novel The Bonfire of the Vanities \u2014 a production so complex, with such a frustrating end product, that it led to one of the best behind-the-scenes books on filmmaking ever written. It\u2019s not hard to see some parallels between this and the contretemps surrounding The Goldfinch: both books were hugely successful novels that seemed to lend themselves to cinematic adaptations. Both attracted high-profile casts. And both sparked a disappointed receptions.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that all high-profile literary adaptations are doomed to failure. Director Stephen Daldry\u2019s take on Michael Cunningham\u2019s Pulitzer-winner The Hours was a critical success, as was Jonathan Demme\u2019s 1998 adaptation of Toni Morrison\u2019s Pulitzer-winning novel Beloved. More recently, Barry Jenkins\u2019s adaptation of James Baldwin\u2019s If Beale Street Could Talk earned impressive reviews and a number of award nominations.\n\nAnd there\u2019s always television \u2014 but even some high-profile literary adaptations for the small screen have encountered a very different problem. Both The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and Big Little Lies received impressive acclaim for their respective first seasons, which drew from the plots of the novels from which they were adapted. But as each has moved into more uncharted territory, each has also encountered some critical bumps in the road, metaphorically speaking.\n\nIn her review of The Goldfinch for Vox, Alissa Wilkinson explores the question of what makes for a faithful literary adaptation \u2014 and how that can actually conflict with a given story\u2019s actual themes. Wilkinson cites Tartt\u2019s penchant for \u201creminders of the importance that mere objects \u2014 like, say, an antique table, or a simple painting of a bird \u2014 can have in a person\u2019s life.\u201d Here, though, is where the film manages to miss the point: \u201cIn the film, those are glanced over before we\u2019ve got to move on to the next thing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that one more high-profile book-to-screen adaptation due later this year, though clearly a labor of love, is unafraid to break with its source material in at least one very significant way. That would be Edward Norton\u2019s take on Jonathan Lethem\u2019s stylized mystery Motherless Brooklyn, first published in 1999. Reading the novel, one finds abundant references to then-contemporary New York. Watch the trailer for Norton\u2019s adaptation and you\u2019ll see a film clearly set in the 1950s. Will that decision work out in the end? It\u2019s possible \u2014 but it\u2019s a good sign that the filmmakers understand the difference between admiring their source material and treating it as a sacred text.", "description": "The poor reviews for the the film adaptation of Donna Tartt's The Goldfinch is the latest famous book that doesn't translate well to the big screen.", "authors": ["Tobias Carroll"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hero-32.jpg?fit=1200%2C750", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
