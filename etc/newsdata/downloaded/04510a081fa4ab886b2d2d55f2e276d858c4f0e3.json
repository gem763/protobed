That\u2019s where all the samurais lived. Every time the samurais fought, one lived and one died.\n\n\u201cIt will be the same on Saturday \u2014 someone is going to live and someone is going to die.\u201d\n\nWith powerhouse number eight Billy Vunipola recovered from an ankle injury, England will hope \u201ckamikaze kids\u201d Tom Curry and Sam Underhill can star at the battle of the breakdown against celebrated Australia duo Michael Hooper and David Pocock.\n\nBehind the scrum, they will look to Farrell to direct operations as they try to contain the threat of Australia\u2019s strong-running Fiji-born centre Samu Kerevi.\n\n\u2013 \u2018He\u2019s a warrior\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cOwen\u2019s got quite a big job for us. He\u2019s captain and he\u2019s goal-kicker,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cBut I feel like sometimes, maybe earlier in the tournament, he spent too much time in the captaincy area and not enough on his own individual prep.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a real change in that this week,\u201d added Jones, whose side\u2019s final pool match against France was cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a warrior. He leads from the front. He competes, he\u2019s tough.\u201d\n\nThe 2015 World Cup saw an Australia side coached by Michael Cheika go all the way to the final after they ended hosts England\u2019s involvement at the pool stage with a 33-13 win at Twickenham.\n\nThat prompted England to bring in Jones and they have since won all six of their Tests against Australia, still coached by Jones\u2019s former Randwick team-mate Cheika.\n\nIf doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result is a sign of madness, Cheika\u2019s bold move in handing the 19-year-old Jordan Petaia a first Test start at centre is evidence of his determination to shake things up.\n\n\u201cHe is more than ready to do this,\u201d said Cheika, who has opted for Will Genia and Christian Lealiifano as his half-backs, with Kurtley Beale passed fit after a head injury.\n\n\u201cI trust him infinitely, and that\u2019s why he has been chosen.\u201d", "description": "Oita (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Rival coaches Eddie Jones and Michael Cheika have both sprung selection surprises heading into a \u201cdo or die\u201d World", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/4ee043_england-captain-owen-farrell-has-restored-fly-samurai-time-as-england-australia-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
