The index was already under\n\npressure from Micron Technology Inc's tumble after it\n\nforecast a disappointing first-quarter profit. The S&P technology sector dropped 1.8%.\n\nU.S.-listed shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N , Baidu\n\nInc and JD.com Inc were sharply lower.\n\nHigh-level trade talks between Washington and Beijing are\n\nscheduled for next month before the start of the third-quarter\n\nearnings season.\n\n\"If our policies spark a major sell off in Shanghai where\n\nthat creates problems for China that could negatively impact the\n\ntrade negotiations which are supposed to start on Oct. 10. That\n\nis where the U.S. based fear would come from,\" said Michael\n\nO'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich,\n\nConnecticut.\n\nAdding to the negative momentum, the S&P 500 index fell\n\nbelow its 50-day moving average in afternoon trading.\n\nAt 2:55PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell\n\n162.36 points, or 0.6%, to 26,728.76, the S&P 500 lost\n\n30.49 points, or 1.02%, to 2,947.13 and the Nasdaq Composite\n\ndropped 136.58 points, or 1.7%, to 7,894.08.\n\nThe three main indexes are set to end lower in a volatile\n\nweek, which included U.S. Democrats launching an impeachment\n\ninvestigation on President Donald Trump.\n\nShares of Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N rose 3.6% and the stock\n\nwas among top gainers on the S&P 500 after the lender\n\nnamed banking veteran Charles Scharf as chief executive officer.\n\nData earlier showed U.S. consumer spending barely rose in\n\nAugust, suggesting that the economy's main growth engine was\n\nslowing after accelerating sharply in the second quarter. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a\n\n1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.05-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the\n\nNasdaq Composite recorded 26 new highs and 104 new lows.", "description": "US STOCKS-Wall St drops; White House considers delisting Chinese companies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/general-use-news-image3_800x533_L_1412758447.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
