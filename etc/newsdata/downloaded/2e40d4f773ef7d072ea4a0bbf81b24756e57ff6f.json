Both runs ultimately scored, turning a two-run deficit into a four-run hole.\n\nAnd when going against Gerrit Cole, those runs all but ended the game, an eventual 4-1 Houston win.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAs Ottavino watched the inning unfold, his inability to deliver on this night ate at him.\n\n\u201cI was just mad at myself,\u201d Ottavino said afterward at his locker. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating when you go out there and don\u2019t perform the way you want to when you have a good mindset. I wanted it. Just didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nAs the Yankees try to navigate October without elite starting pitching and instead riding their high-priced relievers, Ottavino has thus far been the weakest link, the one blemish that could derail this 103-win team and leave them out of the World Series for a 10th straight year. Ottavino owns an 11.57 ERA, and recognizes he could be demoted from high-leverage work.\n\nNew York Yankees relief pitcher Adam Ottavino has struggled in October with an 11.57 ERA. (Brad Penner/USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet. I think I\u2019ll get another opportunity, hopefully. I\u2019m not going to let it define me, dwell on a couple pitches here and there. It\u2019s frustrating,\u201d Ottavino said. \u201cThese are the type of games I want to be in and why I came to this team and everything I wanted my whole life. I want to do better and I want to get out there again. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nAll it takes is one pitcher to be off\n\nSince the Yankees don\u2019t have a standout rotation, they need their bullpen to lead them to a championship.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe biggest concern for teams relying on their bullpens in October \u2014 compared to riding starting pitchers like the Astros and Washington Nationals \u2014 is that it requires each cog in the wheel to be on each night.\n\nWhile the Astros can ride an ace like Justin Verlander or Gerrit Cole, the Yankees are hoping that four to five pitchers, if not more, are going to be at their best each time they\u2019re called upon.\n\nAll it takes is one pitcher to be off to put the Yankees in a bad spot. And that pitcher has been Ottavino. His postseason began by walking Nelson Cruz in Game 1 of the ALDS, leading to an immediate removal from the game, and the same result happened in Game 3.\n\nTwo days ago, Ottavino blew a 2-1 lead in the sixth inning of Game 2 against the Astros when he hung a first-pitch slider to George Springer and the outfielder crushed a game-tying homer.\n\nTommy Kahnle had to strand two runners that reached against Ottavino to keep the game tied.\n\nTen of the 16 batters Ottavino has faced have reached against him, a stark contrast to when he posted a 1.90 ERA, his best ERA for any season in which he appeared more than 10 times.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s not making pitches at a high enough clip I\u2019m accustomed to,\u201d said Ottavino, who signed a three-year, $27-million deal this offseason. \u201cIt\u2019s a game based on results, you got to get them.\u201d\n\nOttavino can\u2019t put his finger on why he\u2019s struggled, believing he has gotten past his recent mechanical issues, but he\u2019s been burned by his struggles to retire the leadoff batters.\n\nHe entered a 2-0 game in the seventh inning Tuesday to face the top of the Astros lineup, which means facing Springer, who torched him two days ago with that series-changing blast. Ottavino got ahead in the count, 1-2, but couldn\u2019t put him away.\n\nHe felt he overthrew the next pitch, and then credited Springer for laying off the 2-2 pitch. Ottavino then missed on a 3-2 pitch, walking a leadoff batter for the third time in six outings.\n\nThe Astros then executed a hit and run with Jose Altuve shooting a single to right field through the vacated hole at second base to put runners on the corners. Ottavino departed to a chorus of boos, and the Astros all but ended the game by plating the next two runs on a wild pitch by Zack Britton and a sacrifice fly to left field by Yuli Gurriel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay ready for my next chance,\u201d Ottavino said. \u201cI\u2019ll work really hard behind the scenes and be confident when I go in there and that\u2019s all I can do. I want to be out there. See what happens.\u201d\n\nAdam Ottavino failed to record an out in ALCS Game 3 on Tuesday night. (Robert Deutsch/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nTime for a change?\n\nAfter relying on Ottavino in critical spots all season long, Boone is now left with the tough decision of whether to remove Ottavino from high-leverage situations or keep the faith.\n\nThe playoffs force managers to react to small sample sizes that they would dismiss in the regular season. A rough six-game stretch in May or June would not sound the alarms. In October, when four games decide your season, a manager can\u2019t be too late to react or his team will watch other teams sip champagne.\n\nBoone seemed to indicate some concern before the game about Ottavino when asked of the righty\u2019s struggles along with those of designated hitter, Edwin Encarnacion. Boone was adamant Encarnacion would be fine, but said Ottavino is needed to get big outs. There seemed to be more conviction that Encarnacion will return to form.\n\nAfter the game, Boone reiterated that this team needs Ottavino to deliver.\n\n\u201cWe'll continue to use him. He was in the midst of a pretty good opening at-bat there with Springer and loses him. That's obviously difficult when you come in from the pen and you have a leadoff walk, especially at the top of the lineup. We've put him in some tough spots obviously in the lineup, and then they're running. And Altuve's first-pitch hit and the night's over,\u201d Boone said. \u201cJust got to be a little sharper with his command, a little sharper with his stuff. We're going to need him moving forward.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees certainly will encounter situations in the remainder of the series that would normally be reserved for Ottavino. But it\u2019s possible this skid could cost him his high-leverage spot, with the Yankees perhaps instead turning to Chad Green.\n\nOttavino can only hope that he can redeem himself.\n\n\u201cI just want to win for the team and for the guys. I just want to do my job,\u201d Ottavino said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most frustrating thing. I feel good. I feel my mindset is good, not letting anything get in there, just consistently not getting the job done so it\u2019s a little frustrating.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Since the Yankees don\u2019t have a standout rotation, they need their bullpen to lead them to a championship.
