Pictured: A silicone gel breast implant\n\nDr Stuart Linder, a board-certified plastic surgeon based in Beverly Hills, California, told DailyMail.com that he thinks the warnings are beneficial.\n\n'A patient cannot have too much information,' he said.\n\n'The more informed patient, the better it is for the doctor ... and for the woman. This is an investment. We're investing in the body and health and cosmetic appearance.'\n\nBreast augmentations were the most popular cosmetic procedure performed in 2018, with more 313,000 operations, according the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\nHowever, about one in five women who get implants for cosmetic reasons need to have them removed within eight to 10 years, according to the FDA.\n\nThe agency also wants companies to explain that breast implants often require repeat surgeries and they should not be considered lifelong devices.\n\n'Having placed over 14,000 implants in my career, we explain pre-operatively to every patient that they will require another operation down the road,' Dr Linder said.\n\n'The average is 10 to 12 years and it could be less. But we tell them that they will have to replaced them down the road.'\n\nThe FDA says it will take public comment on the proposed guidelines before adopting them.\n\nIn recent years, the FDA and regulators elsewhere have grappled with a link between a rare cancer and a type of textured implant.\n\nIn 2017, the FDA linked textured breast implants to ALCL, a rare form of cancer of the immune system, which has killed at least nine people.\n\nAnd, earlier this year, the agency said implants caused the same cancer in 457 American women, up from 414 cases in the previous report.\n\nThis led to the FDA calling on manufacturer Allergan to pull its Biocell implant in July.\n\nThe company issued a worldwide recall for the implants, which had already been restricted or removed from numerous countries, including the US.\n\nIn a separate issue, the FDA has received thousands of reports from women who blame their implants for a host of health problems including rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue and muscle pain.\n\nCurrently, the FDA does not recognize so-called 'breast implant illness' as a diagnosis but, on its website, urges doctors to not dismiss patient concerns until 'much larger and longer' studies are conducted.\n\nThe FDA has stood by its longstanding position that the implants are essentially safe so long as women understand they can have complications.", "description": "On Wednesday, the US Food and Drug Administration called for breast implant manufacturers to add a boxed warning, warning women about potential risks and side effects.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/18/wire-20094216-1571850516-201_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
