Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said she was wrong about a previous statement she made during her 2012 campaign for U.S. Senate calling gender-reassignment surgery for inmates not a \u201cgood use of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\nIn her revised view, Warren called the operation \u201cimportant and appropriate\u201d when posed the question by CNN host Chris Cuomo.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nCUOMO: Senator, quick follow. Speak to your evolution on this. In the 2012 campaign for Senate, you criticized a judge\u2019s ruling that granted transition-related surgery to a transgender inmate. You said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good use of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\nWARREN: Right.\n\nCUOMO: Do you regret that?\n\nWARREN: Yep. No, it was a bad answer. And I think it was a bad answer. And I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care that they need, and that includes people who are transgender, who \u2014 it is the time for them to have gender-affirming surgery. I just think that\u2019s important and the appropriate medical care.\n\nCUOMO: So if you help people get to where they want to be, you also have to protect them as what they are. Do you think that a crime against somebody who is transgender should be charged as a hate crime in statute?\n\nWARREN: You know, I think we could if we think that\u2019s going to be the most effective way to make change. So I\u2019m certainly \u2014 I\u2019m open to this. But I\u2019ll tell you what I really want. I want a Justice Department that takes this seriously. I want to create a Justice Department that says these crimes matter.\n\nAnd when they\u2019re not federal crimes, when they are state crimes, in the same way that our Justice Department is empowered to step in if a state is failing to enforce laws and as a result it\u2019s leaving women unprotected, it\u2019s leaving people of color unprotected, the same should happen for LGBTQ people. We need a Justice Department that is on the side of the people, all of the people.", "description": "Thursday during CNN's LGBTQ issues town hall for the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, Sen.
