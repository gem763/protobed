They appear because they have offended by doing nothing, they have offended by failing to notify changes in their circumstances, they have simply allowed matters to continue.\n\n\"In contrast you took positive steps to take advantage of the benefits system, a system that supports many families in significant need who claim properly, fairly and legitimately from its public purse.\n\n\"But I have received additional information about your family circumstances and more particularly the needs of your son.\n\n\"He is very much dependent upon your support and the support of his father who is the main bread winner.\n\n\"Whilst the presence of children in a household isn't a matter which necessarily prevents carers and others from being imprisoned in appropriate cases it is a matter that I have to take account of.\n\nEarlier prosecutor Fiona Clancy said: \"The total amount of the fraud is \u00a316,138.81 and covers a period of 20 months from 29th June 2016 to 28th February 2018.\n\n(Image: Copyright Cavendish Press)\n\n\"Ms Walton lives with her partner and two children and on May 5 2015 she made a legitimate claim for universal credit due to low household income and she was under a duty to provide information on change of circumstances.\n\n\"On the 13th August 2016 she reported to the DWP she had incurred separate care costs of \u00a3577.60 at Hazelwood Nursery but that proved to be false.\n\n\"A further telephone call reported child care costs with the same after school club of \u00a31057.81 and there was a further false conversation with further physical evidence of forged receipts.\n\nIn mitigation barrister James Preece said: \"The childcare costs were originally genuine childcare costs, however her child couldn't go to the childcare because of his behaviour.\n\n\"At that stage she made the decision that she now deeply regrets to continue to suggest to the DWP that there were child care costs.\n\n\"Whilst the sum has been accepted and was received over this period of time this is not a case where she was living an extravagant lifestyle. The money went back into supporting the family and the family needs.\n\n(Image: Copyright Cavendish Press)\n\n\"Ms Walton has never done anything like this before and finds herself for the first time in crown court, it has caused her to think long and hard about her offending. It has over the few weeks she has been awaiting sentence been at the forefront of her mind.\n\n\"There were full and frank admissions and guilty pleas she wants me to communicate she is very sorry for what she had done.\n\n\"Another factor is where immediate custody results in harmful impact upon others, this is a case where she has two children and the pre-sentence report concludes the impact of custody upon the children would be detrimental in terms of their emotional wellbeing and educational needs.\n\n\"Ms Walton's son needs further support she is the main carer for him and if she were not around he wouldn't be able to cope without her.\n\n\"He needs to be taken to the door of the school that is one of the things that she does for him. Her partner being the main breadwinner and having to go out early in the morning and having to run the scaffolding work that he does the duty falls to Miss Walton.'\n\n\"She is somebody who is important in providing the extra support that her son requires. This court hearing has had a salutary effect on Ms Walton.\"", "description": "Adele Walton, 34, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, was spared jail after a judge decided her 'breadwinner' husband would be forced to give up work to look after their children", "authors": ["Neil Murphy", "Image", "Copyright Cavendish Press", "Adele Walton", "Cavendish Press", "M"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20755345.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Cavendish-Press-Manchester.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
