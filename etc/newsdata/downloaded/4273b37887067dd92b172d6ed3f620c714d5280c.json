Giuliani criticized the president\u2019s nominee for ambassador to Russia Wednesday night for \u201cincorrectly speculating\u201d at his confirmation hearing about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s role with Ukraine.\n\nOn Twitter, the embattled Mr. Giuliani took issue with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who told senators earlier Wednesday that he was aware of a \u201ccampaign\u201d by Mr. Giuliani to oust the previous U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe Amb. nominee doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about and shouldn\u2019t be incorrectly speculating,\u201d Mr. Giuliani tweeted. \u201cThis is an orchestrated attempt to harass and hinder me in my role as @realDonaldTrump\u2019s attorney.\u201d\n\nMr. Sullivan told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he had been aware since last spring of a smear campaign by Mr. Giuliani and others outside the Trump administration to remove then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\n\n\u201cI was aware that Mr. Giuliani was involved in Ukraine issues,\u201d he said. \u201cMy knowledge\u2026was focused on his campaign basically against our ambassador to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nHe said Ms. Yovanovitch served admirably in the post.\n\nMr. Giuliani countered that he had gathered the information while defending the president from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe of alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign in 2016.\n\n\u201cAll of the information I obtained came from interviews conducted as private defense counsel to [the president], to defend him against false allegations,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI began obtaining this information while Mueller was still investigating his witch hunt and a full 5 months before [Democratic frontrunner Joseph R.] Biden even announced his run for Pres. It won\u2019t work!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump and his allies have taken issue with Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter, who held a lucrative post with a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president.\n\nMr. Giuliani has acknowledged working to have Ms. Yovanovitch removed, and said those efforts were coordinated with the State Department.\n\nMr. Sullivan told lawmakers that neither he nor Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked Mr. Giuliani to intervene on behalf of the State Department with Ukraine.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
