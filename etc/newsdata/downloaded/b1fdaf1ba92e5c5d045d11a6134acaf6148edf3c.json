Boris Johnson leads the most demented to date. He uses \u201cthe will of the people\u201d to justify the replacement of parliamentary scrutiny with coercion and deceit. Mr Johnson won power because two-thirds of the Tory members preferred the worst foreign secretary in living memory to his successor. Many feared, to quote Mr Johnson\u2019s hero Winston Churchill, that his was the worst appointment since \u201cCaligula made his horse a consul\u201d.\n\nMr Johnson has proved better organised and more ruthless than his opponents. If he can, he aims to offer MPs a Hobson\u2019s choice next month of implementing Brexit either via a \u201cnegotiated\u201d deal or with no deal at all. Then Britain will leave the EU on 31 October, \u201cdo or die\u201d. If his MPs try to force Mr Johnson to ask the EU for a three-month delay to the Brexit leaving date, he apparently will deselect them. Labour should support the Tory rebels, not least because parliament has voted against a damaging no-deal Brexit.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s strategy is to save his job rather than Brexit. He casts himself as reasonable and his opponents as unreasonable, placing himself as a populist champion of the people against a remainer parliament. So from the steps of Downing Street he called on Tory MPs not to vote with the opposition, warning this would \u201cchop the legs\u201d from under the UK. Yet European leaders say there is nothing to talk about. Even Mr Johnson\u2019s idea that the Irish backstop could be replaced by alternative arrangements is demonstrably false. The prime minister said he did not want an election, understandable given that he has just entered No 10. The truth is he has a parliamentary majority of one and would struggle even to pass a Queen\u2019s speech. If thwarted by a combination of Labour votes and those of his own MPs, Mr Johnson would attempt to popularise a no-deal EU exit in an election, blaming a liberal elite for stopping Brexit. This would counter the threat of the Brexit party and also crowd out his opponents\u2019 truthful message of no-deal doom.\n\nJeremy Corbyn has repeatedly called for an early election. Labour does not actually need to vote against a motion for an early election; its MPs could deny the government a two-thirds majority by abstaining. The risk here is that Mr Johnson would be able to stoke the belief in leave-voting constituencies that Mr Corbyn was either frit or a remainer. It is hard to see how Labour could not accept Mr Johnson\u2019s challenge. Hostility to immigration was central to the 2016 leave victory. Since access to the EU\u2019s single market and the customs union are irreconcilable with ending free movement of its citizens, Brexiters ought to level with the public over the issue of immigration. But they instead prefer to appeal in populist fashion to voters \u2013 yesterday\u2019s \u201cbogus asylum seekers\u201d are today\u2019s migrants storming English beaches.\n\nSince 2007, the UK has been run by six regimes, five Tory and one Labour. But only one has obtained high office by winning a parliamentary majority at a general election \u2013 and David Cameron\u2019s mistakes provide an abject lesson of how power not only corrupts but also breeds folly. Being in command often causes a failure to think; the responsibility of power fades as it is exercised. Governments need to be constrained by facts. There ought to be detailed white papers setting out the consequences of departure, rather than a \u201cGet ready for Brexit\u201d information blitz. All misgovernment is contrary to self-interest in the long run, however much it might strengthen a regime temporarily. An election victory for a hard Brexit Tory party would come at a dismal cost to the country: not only would we perversely persist with a counter-productive and probably unworkable EU exit but we will be doomed to sterile enmity with our nearest friends and partners.", "description": "Editorial: The prime minister wants an election because he wants to stay in post.
