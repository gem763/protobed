And a significant chunk of those who live on the streets are in one state: California.\n\nAll told, 47% of all unsheltered homeless people nationwide \u2014 meaning those who sleep in areas not meant for habitation such as sidewalks, parks, cars and abandoned buildings, rather than shelters \u2014 are found in the Golden State, according to a new report on homelessness from the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Unsheltered homeless people represent just over a third (35%) of the overall homeless population nationwide.\n\nAt the city level, four of the five cities with the highest rate of unsheltered homelessness are located in California: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Santa Rosa and San Jose. The other city on this list is Seattle.\n\nIn recent weeks, reports have suggested that the Trump administration may stake a federal intervention in California to address homelessness in the state.\n\nAs for overall homelessness rates, the District of Columbia has the highest in the country, at 5.8 times the U.S. rate. New York is next, followed by Hawaii, Oregon and California. Altogether, these five states comprise 45% of the country\u2019s entire homeless population, despite only having 20% of the overall population.\n\nThe White House report teased out certain trends in homelessness across the country. Communities along both coasts have a much larger homeless population than those in the middle of the country. One driver of this trend is likely the more notable rise in housing prices along the coasts than in the Midwest.\n\nAnd states with warmer climates were generally more likely to see larger concentrations of people living on the streets. However, some warmer states such as Texas and Florida has smaller homeless populations than would otherwise be expected given these factors.\n\nTo that extent, the White House report identified local laws and policing practices as a potential differentiator. \u201cSome [states] more than others engage in more stringent enforcement of quality of life issues like restrictions on the use of tents and encampments, loitering, and other related activities,\u201d the report noted.\n\nDeregulation and policing are among the Trump administration\u2019s proposals for reducing homelessness\n\nThe Trump administration has floated a range of proposals on how to curb the homelessness crisis across the nation.\n\nFor starters, the White House cited the need for deregulation. Many states and municipalities have zoning rules regarding the construction of single- and multi-family homes that have impeded builders\u2019 ability to meet the high demand for housing. The lack of new housing units has driven up prices.\n\nExperts and politicians across the political spectrum have suggested that relaxing these regulations could give a boost to building activity and alleviate some of the pressure people face in securing affordable housing.\n\nBut the Trump administration has gone a step further in suggesting that law enforcement could also play a role in curbing homelessness. \u201cOf course, policies intended solely to arrest or jail homeless people simply because they are homeless are inhumane and wrong,\u201d the report stated. \u201cAt the same time, when paired with effective services, policing may be an important tool to help move people off the street and into shelter or housing.\u201d\n\nThe report went on to say that homelessness is worsened by \u201cthe tolerability of sleeping on the street, which among other factors may be affected through policing of street activities.\u201d The report did not outline specific policies that law enforcement should adopt, but did argue that more research to this end was needed.\n\nIn the past week, affordable-housing advocates have criticized the Trump administration\u2019s rumored plans to use policing in addressing homelessness. The White House has reportedly considered razing tent camps in cities like Los Angeles and directing those people into government-run facilities.\n\n\u201cThe solution to homelessness is affordable homes \u2014 not further criminalization, punishing poor people for their poverty, sweeping people experiencing homelessness into increasingly unsafe areas, or warehousing people in untenable and unsustainable conditions, all of which are proposals that the White House is seriously considering. These proposals are abhorrent and unconscionable,\u201d the National Low Income Housing Coalition said in a statement.", "description": "The Trump administration proposed multiple solutions to the homelessness crisis, including deregulation and policing.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR478_tentci_ZG_20190917161144.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
