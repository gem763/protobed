They claim Biden, during his tenure as vice president, withheld $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to compel the country\u2019s firing of a top prosecutor in order to protect his son, Hunter Biden. While it\u2019s true that Biden, following a foreign policy position of the Obama administration, urged Ukrainian leaders to oust the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, there\u2019s no evidence that he did it to help his son.\n\nDespite the facts, the Times still disseminated this conspiracy theory, Bedingfield said.\n\nShe pointed specifically to a widely criticized article published in the paper on May 1 that said in its headline that Biden was facing \u201cconflict of interest questions\u201d regarding Ukraine that were \u201cbeing promoted by Trump and allies.\u201d\n\nThe story, written by reporter Ken Vogel and freelance writer Iuliia Mendel, described how Biden had appealed to Ukrainian leaders for Shokin\u2019s ouster and how his son Hunter Biden had a \u201cstake in the outcome\u201d as he was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that had been in Shokin\u2019s \u201csights.\u201d\n\nVogel\u2019s and Mendel\u2019s story included a line stating that \u201cno evidence has surfaced that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing\u201d for Shokin\u2019s dismissal. However, as The Washington Post\u2019s Erik Wemple pointed out at the time, that caveat comes 19 paragraphs into the story.\n\n\u201cIn those first 19 paragraphs is a knot of details bound to be mangled by cable-news hosts and pundits in the coming months,\u201d Wemple, the Post\u2019s media critic, wrote in a column.\n\nIn her letter to Baquet, Bedingfield pointed out that the Times\u2019 reporting had promptly been challenged by Bloomberg News, which said the investigation into Burisma had been \u201cdormant\u201d at the time Biden was discussing Shokin\u2019s future with Ukrainian leaders.\n\nBedingfield also noted that Mendel, one of the co-authors of the Times story, joined the Ukrainian government as a spokesperson for the president of Ukraine just weeks after the article was published.\n\nConservative author Peter Schweizer gets top billing in the New York Times today! pic.twitter.com/dqcNamHKuc \u2014 Sal Rizzo (@rizzoTK) October 9, 2019\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign also took issue with an op-ed critical of the Bidens published in the Times on Wednesday by author Peter Schweizer, who was lambasted by Bedingfield as a \u201cdiscredited, right-wing polemicist.\u201d\n\nSchweizer \u201chas been one of the top people pushing the claim that Biden abused his office,\u201d Darcy wrote in CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources newsletter, adding that Schweizer \u2015 a senior contributor at right-wing site Breitbart \u2015 previously pushed the debunked conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton benefiting from a \u201cpay-for-play\u201d scheme involving uranium reserves.\n\nGovernment Accountability Institute President @PeterSchweizer revealed the Joe and Hunter Biden corruption scandals in Ukraine and China over a year and a half ago. The Establishment Media is finally catching up--and blocking and tackling for the Bidens. https://t.co/HIg2vxW4Vb \u2014 Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) September 30, 2019\n\nIn response to the Biden campaign\u2019s letter, the Times defended its coverage of Biden and his son as \u201cfair and accurate.\u201d\n\nThe Times \u201cwill continue to cover Joe Biden with the same tough and fair standards we apply to every candidate in the race and we\u2019re happy to sit down with Biden advisers anytime to discuss news coverage,\u201d a spokesman told Darcy, adding that Schweizer\u2019s op-ed had been published in the Opinion section of the newspaper, \u201cwhere their mission is to invite intelligent discussion on a range of opinions and ideas.\u201d\n\nBedingfield\u2019s dressing-down of the Times follows two other letters sent this week by the Biden campaign to Facebook and Twitter. In those letters, Biden\u2019s team criticized the companies for allowing a Trump campaign video ad that pushes the Biden-Ukraine conspiracy to run on their platforms \u2015 and urged them to block the clip.\n\nFacebook has refused to remove the ad, citing a \u201cfundamental belief in free expression\u201d and \u201crespect for the democratic process.\u201d Twitter has yet to respond publicly to the request.\n\nThe dissemination of \u201cobjectively false information to influence public opinion poisons the public discourse and chips away at our democracy,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo said in a statement about the ad to CNN.\n\n\u201cWhether it originates from the Kremlin or Trump Tower, these lies and conspiracy theories threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections in America,\u201d Ducklo added.\n\nAs NBC News\u2019 Dylan Byers reported Wednesday, Facebook and Twitter aren\u2019t the only platforms that have continued to air Trump\u2019s Biden-Ukraine ad despite its unfounded content.\n\nCNN is the only media or tech company that\u2019s banned the ad from its airwaves, Byers said. NBC News, ABC News and YouTube are among the organizations that have not.\n\nThese are the media/tech companies that have banned Trump\u2019s misleading Biden/Ukraine ad:\n\n\n\n\u2022 CNN\n\n\n\nThese are the ones that have not banned it:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Fox News\n\n\u2022 MSNBC/NBC\n\n\u2022 ABC\n\n\u2022 CBS\n\n\u2022 Facebook\n\n\u2022 Google/YouTube\n\n\u2022 Twitter \u2014 Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) October 9, 2019", "description": "The Times was criticized for prioritizing \"sensationalism\" over \u201ctruth\" in its spread of a \"baseless conspiracy theory\" about Biden and Ukraine.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9ecd3621000042073436da.jpeg?cache=l9jn0vkta8&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
