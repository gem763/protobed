Mr. Gantz was the chief of staff who oversaw the devastating, 50-day war against militant groups in Gaza five years ago.\n\nThen the numbers began to change.\n\nThree of the 13 Arab lawmakers, from the hard-line Balad party, opposed the Gantz endorsement and demanded that their seats be withdrawn. Writing in Haaretz on Thursday, Dr. Mtanes Shehadeh, a Balad lawmaker, cited Mr. Gantz\u2019s military record and what he called his \u201cglorification of the murder of civilians in the Gaza Strip in the previous election campaign.\u201d\n\nMr. Gantz had ignored the demands of the Arab parties, including repealing a law that declared Israel the nation-state only of the Jewish people, and denied holding talks with them, Mr. Shehadeh wrote.\n\nThe Joint List wanted to oust Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Shehadeh wrote, \u201cbut we never promised to do so by supporting the ostensibly less dangerous candidate, Gantz, at any price.\u201d\n\nThat brought Mr. Gantz\u2019s endorsements down to 54, one fewer than Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nBut that may have been part of Mr. Gantz\u2019s plan.\n\nAyman Odeh, the leader of the Arab alliance, said Wednesday that a Blue and White lawmaker approached him and told him that 10 recommendations were preferable to 13, because Mr. Gantz did not want to come out on top and go first in trying to form a coalition.\n\nMr. Gantz believed that if Mr. Netanyahu went first he would fail, Mr. Odeh explained in a Facebook Live video. By going second, he said, Mr. Gantz hoped that other parties would have to compromise and enter a Gantz-led coalition because they would be under pressure from the public to avoid a third election.", "description": "A week after an election appeared to jeopardize his career, Prime Minister Netanyahu is tapped to assemble a government.
