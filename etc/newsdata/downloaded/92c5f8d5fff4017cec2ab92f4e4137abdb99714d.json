They've put in so much work so far against a background of pressure from off the field, not on it.\n\n\"You know that I am coming here to win with our team.\"\n\nFor the Fiji clash, Cheika has selected the world-class pair of David Pocock, returning from a calf injury ahead of a post World Cup retirement, and captain Michael Hooper in the back row.\n\nHe has also been prepared to give players fresh starts.\n\nJames O'Connor, the one-time \"bad boy\" of Australian rugby, plays at outside centre in a back division where cancer survivor Christian Lealiifano is at fly-half.\n\nMeanwhile Tolu Latu, who faced a drink-driving charge this year, has been selected at hooker.\n\nCheika, who brought O'Connor back into the Australia fold in August after a six-year absence having never worked with him previously, insisted the playmaker's \"work ethic and the way he has reintegrated himself into the team says a lot about him.\"\n\n- 'Scrum factory' -\n\nAs for Fiji, they face similar difficulties as other Pacific island nations in retaining their best players in the face of greater commercial and sporting opportunities in wealthier nations.\n\nAustralia, for example, have three Fijians in their starting XV -- Samu Kerevi, Marika Koroibete and Isi Naisarani.\n\nAnother perennial problem for Fiji, who knocked pool rivals Wales out of the 2007 edition, is a lack of major matches between World Cups, although they did beat France 21-14 in Paris in November.\n\nWhile backs of the quality of Semi Radradra maintain Olympic Sevens champions Fiji's reputation for running rugby, there have long been doubts about their forwards.\n\nThey have, however, benefitted from a decision by World Rugby, which has provided some \u00a360 million ($75 million) to Tier Two nations for World Cup preparation, to set up a \"scrum factory\" in Fiji a few years ago.\n\nBut with 12 of Fiji's starting XV at overseas clubs -- many in Europe -- they lack the same cohesion as countries reliant on one or two leagues.\n\nThe failure to set-up a global Nations League has not helped Fiji's cause, with a place in Super Rugby, the southern hemisphere's major annual international tournament, seemingly no nearer for any of the Pacific island nations.\n\nIt is 65 years since Fiji last beat the Wallabies, although coach John McKee still insisted: \"We know Australia are a very good team and present a big challenge for us but, because of our preparation, I know that our team is mentally and physically ready for that challenge.\"", "description": "Australia and Fiji will look to put their off-field worries aside with their World Cup opener in Sapporo on Saturday.
