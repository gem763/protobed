Catherine has lost a significant amount of weight over the years, going from a size 22 to a 10, which can often result in a loss of breast tissue,\" says the expert.\n\n(Image: BPM)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"In my professional opinion, there is an obvious increase to Catherine's breasts that suggest she may have undergone a breast enlargement procedure; the upper breast volume has increased quite significantly and they now sit much higher on the chest wall.\n\n\"It's particularly noticeable when you compare these photos to previous images where she appears to have a lack of breast tissue altogether following the weight loss.\n\n\"I also believe that Catherine may have undergone the non-surgical treatment of dermal fillers to her lips as she appears to have slightly fuller lips compared to previous images.\n\n(Image: SOPA Images/LightRocket via Gett)\n\n\"The average cost of lip fillers in the UK can range depending on the provider and the amount of filler used, however, you can expect to pay anything from \u00a3200 to \u00a31,000 per treatment.\"\n\nCatherine's rep added: \"She absolutely has not had hasn't had a breast enlargement or lip fillers.\"\n\n*Strictly Come Dancing continues tonight at 6.40pm on BBC1", "description": "Catherine Tyldesley underwent a dramatic body transformation in her 20s after losing five stone", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Bpm", "Getty Images", "Sopa Images Lightrocket Via Gett"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20640992.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EL090908FILM-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
