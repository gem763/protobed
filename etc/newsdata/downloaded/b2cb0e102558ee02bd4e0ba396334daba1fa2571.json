Other patrons yelled at the man, who spit on them as they left early, said Nathanael Hood, who was in the theater.\n\n\"I was scared. I'm sure a lot of other people were,\" Hood said in an interview conducted by private messages.\n\nRead more: 'Joker' makes an explicit connection between mental illness and violence. Here's why that's dangerous and wrong.\n\nSocial media users posted photos of police, security sweeps and safety notices at theaters in California and Florida. And in Tennessee, a drive-in theater banned moviegoers from wearing costumes to a screening of the R-rated \"Joker,\" which scored an October box-office record with $13.3 million in earnings.\n\nThe Warner Bros. film, directed by Todd Phillips, presents the backstory of the man who becomes Batman's classic foe. Starring Joaquin Phoenix, it probes the journey of a disturbed man with a penetrating laugh into a killer.\n\nWhile Phillips has said he hopes the film inspires discussions about guns, violence and the treatment of people with mental illness, some feared the movie could inspire violence, particularly after a mass shooting killed 12 at a Colorado theater during a screening of another Batman movie in 2012.\n\nA disruption began in the seats when the on-screen action grew intense\n\nHood, who attended an afternoon viewing of \"Joker\" at AMC Empire 25 in Times Square, said a disruption began in the seats when the action on the screen grew intense.\n\n\"About halfway through when Joker started killing people and monologuing about how society is evil he started clapping really loudly and incessantly for a good minute. People started yelling for him to shut up, but he kept clapping and cheering like mad,\" Hood said.\n\nThe man started clapping and cheering again \"really loudly\" during a climactic gunfight, he said, and got \"belligerent\" when people told him to quit.\n\nRead more: 12 details and references you may have missed in 'Joker'\n\n\"Finally security came and got him. He was still being interrogated outside the theater when we came out,\" said Hood. Plenty of police were around the theater, he said.\n\nAnother moviegoer, Etai Benson, said the loud man was sitting beside him at the start of the movie and poured what appeared to be a full bottle of alcohol into a drink. The man's behavior \"combined with the carnage happening onscreen got people nervous,\" he said.\n\n\"This was most likely a harmless drunk guy, but all the nervousness built around the film made what happened (Friday) night really unsettling,\" Benson said in an interview conducted by private messages.\n\nA spokesman for the Kansas-based AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., which operates AMC Theatres, did not immediately return an email seeking comment.\n\nMoviegoers have been on alert across the country\n\nThe FBI told local police agencies to monitor potentially threatening online posts related to the film.\n\nPhotos posted on social media showed officers and a police dog outside a theater where \"Joker\" was being shown in Orlando, Florida, and a police SUV was parked on the sidewalk outside a cinema in suburban Birmingham, Alabama, during a screening. In Bristol, Tennessee, the owner of the Twin City Drive-In Theater, Danny Warden, posted a warning on Facebook that anyone wearing a costume or mask to see \"Joker\" wouldn't be allowed in, and anyone who smuggled in an outfit would be asked to leave. Warden told that the decision was \"common sense\" after the film sparked concerns about its violent content.", "description": "The \"Joker\" movie's opening weekend left some moviegoers in New York uneasy with extra layers of security and a frightening incident inside a theater.", "authors": ["Jay Reeves", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d98faaf5d21aa22693e8f77?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
