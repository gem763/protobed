You can\u2019t make this up\u201d\n\nOne even suggested that this may be the podcaster\u2019s new normal.\n\nSpeculation arose as to who the mysterious guest may be. One person pointed to Dr. Steven Greer an American ufologist and founder of the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence and the Disclosure Project. Another posited that it may be Bob Lazar, an entrepreneur who blew the Whistle on area 51.\n\nSo, are we about to witness a transition into conspiracy theories for one of bitcoin\u2019s most prominent advocates? Will pomp become the next Alex Jones?\n\nPomp Wants to Believe\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first example of Pomp\u2019s predilection towards extraterrestrials; in fact, we should have probably this coming, he\u2019s been pretty hot on the topic in the past.\n\nAs early as 2018, Pomp has been questioning the validity of otherworldly beings.\n\nHe\u2019s even taken to asking a few of his guests about their views on alien life. On fellow crypto podcaster Peter McCormack\u2019s show, \u2018What Bitcoin Did,\u2019 Pomp elaborated on how the alien question came about:\n\n\u201cAliens though, I actually really care what your answer is. But I also get to see how do you think and so there\u2019s some people who come in and they\u2019re funny. They say, \u2018oh, we\u2019re the pets\u2019, or \u2018we\u2019re the aliens\u2019. It gives me a lot of insight of who they are.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Might Kill the Search for Alien Life\n\nRegardless of the synergy Pompliano seeks between crypto and aliens, he might have to pick a side reasonably promptly. According to researchers from Seti (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), the hunt for ET is being bottlenecked by crypto miners hoarding all the equipment.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Dan Werthimer said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to use the latest GPUs [graphics processing units]\u2026 and we can\u2019t get \u2019em \u2026 That\u2019s limiting our search for extra-terrestrials, to try to answer the question, \u2018Are we alone? Is there anybody out there?'\u201d\n\nHowever, not all hope is lost. A discounted discovery of organic life on Mars made in the 1970s has resurfaced. Gilbert Levin, a former NASA scientist, recently disclosed information from the Viking program \u2013 an experiment to discover life on the Red Planet. A probe sent to Mars apparently uncovered the existence of organic microbes, but the investigation wasn\u2019t replicable by NASA and therefore dismissed. Levin, however, argues that this was one of the first of a few discoveries of extraterrestrial life.\n\nSo it seems that Pomp may be on to something. Who knows, if this next interview goes well we could see the bitcoin bull become a full-time alien conspiracist.", "description": "Bitcoin bull, Anthony 'Pomp' Pompliano has apparently put his preferred subject to bed in favor of a more otherworldly topic, aliens.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aliens.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
