Both for the UK and for the EU.\"\n\nIt was after this, as reporters began to shout questions, that Mr Juncker expressed his sadness, before the pair walked away without taking any questions from reporters.\n\nDespite his triumphant announcements, the PM faces a uphill battle to have his deal passed by Parliament.\n\nThe DUP, which backs the Tories in a confidence and supply agreement, has said it will not support it.\n\nMeanwhile. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn branded the agreement worse than Theresa May's, which the House rejected multiple times.\n\nRead more\n\nBoris Johnson seals Brexit deal - but DUP says no", "description": "Boris Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker appeared divided on sentiment as they stood united to announce details of their new Brexit agreement.The PM said the agreement could deliver a \"real Brexit\", and promised it will allow the UK to leave the EU \"whole and entire\".", "authors": ["Jacob Jarvis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hXt2dPqPSWexI5fWc1wqhQ--~B/aD0zMzE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/df42baeee551c351ba8b695a082bfa94", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
