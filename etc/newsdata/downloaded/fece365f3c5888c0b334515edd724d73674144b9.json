I didn\u2019t expect them to play so deep, they only shot on target at set pieces, but they did what they did so well,\u201d said Guardiola, who praised Sterling for his improved finishing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a player who is always there, he has this talent he loves to score goals, you always have that feeling. We had chances but they defended really well and that\u2019s why it was difficult to score a goal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think still he can improve his finishing. Today the pass for Phil was perfect. But still there is a gap to be even more clinical but it\u2019s important that all the time he\u2019s there and that\u2019s why he\u2019s been able to score the goals,\u201d he said.\n\nFoden\u2019s instant impact, with his goal coming four minutes after he came on, left Guardiola feeling sorry that he was unable to find more minutes for the talented 19-year-old.\n\n\u201cI know, he deserves to play, I want to give him minutes, I\u2019m unfair to him, I\u2019m sorry but he has (Kevin) De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Rodri (ahead of him).\n\n\u201cI know the best way is for him to play minutes but he\u2019s so young. I don\u2019t know many players of his age (who) have played so many minutes, he\u2019s going to be incredible in the future but it is what it is.\u201d", "description": "Manchester City made it two wins out of two in Champions League Group C after goals from substitutes Raheem Sterling and Phil Foden gave Pep Guardiola's side a 2-0 victory over Dinamo Zagreb on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436180355&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910LP-OZASP"}
