He thought that education ideally was a collaborative process in which the instructor draws out ideas in conversation with students rather than simply lecturing to them.\n\nThat educational philosophy used to be more widely used than it is today. For one thing, it\u2019s easier to just talk at students (or, worse yet, put power-point screens up for them to copy) than to try engaging their minds. For another, many educators are trying to fill vessels \u2014 they want students to believe what they believe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Socratic (or classical) approach to education isn\u2019t gone, however. In today\u2019s Martin Center article, Shannon Watkins writes about a recent conference she attended that was devoted to reviving it. She writes, \u201cThe symposium\u2019s overarching theme was \u2018Reading as Soul-Formation: How Great Books Change Lives.\u2019 During the symposium, educators spoke about living the examined life, cultivating one\u2019s \u2018moral imagination,\u2019 and how words provide an understanding of objective reality.\u201d\n\nProfessor Matthew Post of the University of Dallas emphasized that Socratic method is beneficial because it breeds intellectual humility in both students and instructors, and because it leads to better retention of concepts.\n\nAt least two colleges have programs to help future teachers absorb the Socratic method \u2014 Hillsdale and Grove City.\n\nWatkins concludes:\n\nModern cognitive research affirms truths about human nature that Socrates recognized years ago: \u2018[E]ducation is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.\u2019 He understood that education is not simply about giving students the \u201cright answers,\u201d but about compelling them to participate in the lifelong search for wisdom.", "description": "The Socratic method and intellectual humility.", "authors": ["George Leef", "Jim Geraghty", "William Z.
