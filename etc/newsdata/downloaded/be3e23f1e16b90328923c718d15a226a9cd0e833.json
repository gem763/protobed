He wasn\u2019t tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.\u201d\n\nThe conversation, several Democratic officials said, only devolved from there, and reached a fever pitch after Ms. Pelosi told the president that Russia, which has quickly stepped in to fill the void left by American troops in Syria, \u201chas always wanted a foothold in the Middle East.\u201d It was at this point that she told Mr. Trump that all roads with him led to Mr. Putin.\n\nAt another point, Mr. Trump told Ms. Pelosi that he cared more about defeating terrorism than she did.\n\n\u201cI hate ISIS more than you do,\u201d the president declared.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d the speaker replied.\n\nWhat happened next is now a matter of ammunition by both the Democrats and the White House.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just a politician,\u201d Mr. Trump said to Ms. Pelosi.\n\n\u201cSometimes I wish you were,\u201d Ms. Pelosi shot back.\n\nMr. Schumer interjected, telling Mr. Trump that name-calling was not necessary.\n\n\u201cIs that a bad name, Chuck?\u201d Mr. Trump asked, then turned to Ms. Pelosi. \u201cYou\u2019re not a politician, you\u2019re a third-grade politician.\u201d (Or \u201cthird-rate,\u201d depending on which politician was doing the retelling.)\n\nMs. Pelosi stood up to leave, but then sat back down. At this point Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the House majority leader \u2014 who later said he was \u201cdeeply offended\u201d by the president\u2019s treatment of the speaker \u2014 said it was time to go.", "description": "\u201cI hate ISIS more than you do,\u201d President Trump said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi replied.
