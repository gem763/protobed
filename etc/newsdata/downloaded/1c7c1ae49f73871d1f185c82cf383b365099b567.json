She became known as \u2018Emily Doe\u2019 \u2013 and her assailant served just three months in prison. Now she\u2019s ready to tell the world who she really is\n\nIt has been just over three weeks since Chanel Miller allowed her name to become public and the 27-year-old is still trying to adjust. For a while, it seemed as if everyone she had ever known was going to email. \u201cHi! We were in bio-chem class together, how are you doing?!\u201d she\u2019d read. Or: \u201cHey, I always knew you\u2019d write a book!\u201d She smiles at the bleak comedy of a situation which no one, least of all Miller herself, knows quite how to handle. At some point in the emails, every sender would jettison the pleasantries and make the awkward turn towards saying: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nAround midnight on 17 January 2015, Miller was spotted by two students at Stanford University being sexually assaulted by a third student as she lay unconscious on the ground behind some bins. She was 22, a recent graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara, working in her first job at a tech firm and living with her parents in Palo Alto. Earlier that evening she had, on a whim, agreed to accompany her younger sister to a fraternity party at Stanford University, a 10-minute drive from the house. By the early hours of the morning, Miller was in a hospital having her vagina and anus swabbed by police doctors \u2013 and 19-year-old Brock Turner was in custody.\n\nWhat happened next has become a textbook example of the double standards applied to sexual assault victims and their assailants. While Turner was characterised as a champion swimmer, conscientious student and upstanding young man surely incapable of assault, Miller became the \u201cdrunk girl at the party\u201d.\n\nIn that moment, her life split in two. To the majority of her friends and family, she was still Chanel \u2013 an anglicised version of her Chinese name, Zhang Xiao Xia \u2013 albeit a more muted version of the woman they knew. Within the legal system, and in a small, dark chamber of her own mind, she was \u201cEmily Doe\u201d, the pseudonym of the \u201cBrock Turner sexual assault victim\u201d, a woman reduced to the sum total of what someone else had done to her. After Turner was convicted of three counts of felony sexual assault and sentenced to just six months in prison \u2013 of which he ultimately served three \u2013 Miller read out a victim impact statement in court. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d she said, addressing Turner directly, \u201cbut you\u2019ve been inside me, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u201d Over 12 subsequent pages, Miller delineated, with devastating precision, the experience of being sexually assaulted by a man for whom the legal system had more sympathy than his victim. In June 2016, when the statement was published by BuzzFeed, more than 18 million people read it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A woman carries a sign in solidarity for Miller during graduation at Stanford University.

Miller is slight and softly spoken, with long hair and a mildly sardonic air, the kind of details that the victim in a sexual assault is used to having raised. Since the trial, every decision Miller makes \u2013 what to wear, how to comport herself, the extent to which she should smile or not smile, where she should go and what route she should take to get there \u2013 has, for a split-second, been refracted through what she calls \u201cthe lens of court\u201d, a reflex audit of how her most trivial choices might be levelled against her by lawyers. \u201cI know how to dismiss and turn down the volume on those voices, that question and reprimand,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s all there and it is really inhibiting.\u201d\n\nKnow My Name is written in vivid, punishing detail. The fraternity house has \u201ca sour, yeasty atmosphere, where you could hear the soles of your shoes unpeeling from sticky floors\u201d. After the assault, Miller\u2019s body is \u201ca nerveless mannequin\u201d. She is bitterly funny about the dehumanising absurdity of the rape processing suite, where, after being swabbed and photographed (\u201cI wondered if I was suppose to smile with teeth, where I should be looking\u201d) she is given some sweatpants and a pamphlet, which together seem to say: \u201cWelcome to the club, here\u2019s your new uniform. In your folder you\u2019ll find guidelines that will lay out the steps of trauma and recovery which may take your entire lifetime.\u201d\n\nThe amazing thing, says Miller, is that at the time, the circumstances of her assault seemed so open and shut that in her innocence she imagined there was no case to be answered. \u201cIf someone is found humping an unmoving body, what is the case?\u201d she says now. The case was one of consent; Turner pleaded innocent and claimed not only to have asked Miller \u201cif she wanted me to finger her\u201d, but to have asked if she liked it and heard her confirm: \u201cUh-huh.\u201d\n\nYou get to choose how the experience serves you; what you draw from it. I use my anger as fuel, my grief as strength\n\nMore broadly, however, the case turned less on the specifics of Miller\u2019s conduct that night and more on her credibility as a victim. Miller\u2019s sexual history, relationship status and the question of whether or not she \u201cdid a lot of partying in college\u201d were all considered permissible points of access for Turner\u2019s defence, as was the fact that, prior to blacking out and waking up in the hospital, she had peed outside. A man who drunkenly takes a leak under a tree is unremarkable; a woman who does so is lewd.\n\nThere were other biases at work, among them the broad assumption that alcohol excuses sexual assault, particularly on campus. Oddly, this presumption is nowhere more starkly on display than in journalist Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s new book, Talking to Strangers \u2013 the publicity for which promises to examine a \u201cseries of encounters and misunderstandings\u201d between people and in which he quotes extensively from Miller\u2019s case.\n\nSet aside, for a moment, the ethics of a man using the raw transcript of a woman\u2019s sexual assault trial to prop up his theory about communication, and focus on Gladwell\u2019s assertion that: \u201cPeople v. Brock Turner is a case about alcohol.\u201d The entire case, Gladwell writes, \u201cturned on the degree of Emily Doe\u2019s drunkenness\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brock Turner leaves the Santa Clara County Jail in San Jose.

But in answer to the question: \u201cHow did an apparently harmless encounter on a dancefloor end in a crime?\u201d Gladwell describes the assault as a \u201ctransparency failure on steroids\u201d, and offers the apparently blithe summary: \u201cA young woman and a young man meet at a party, then proceed to tragically misunderstand each other\u2019s intentions \u2013 and they\u2019re drunk.\u201d Little credence is given to the possibility raised at the trial that Turner, far from \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d the signals from Miller, could have understood them perfectly, nor that the pivotal disinhibiting agent in this case may not have been alcohol but misogyny. An unconscious woman cannot object when a man inserts his fingers and foreign objects into her vagina; what Emily Doe did or didn\u2019t want was irrelevant.\n\nAt mention of Gladwell, Miller smiles and zips her mouth. Who needs it? But a moment later, she says: \u201cWe say alcohol is the cause, but to me it\u2019s such a small way of thinking. Alcohol could never be the root of something that is part of such a greater pattern: when you look at the thousands of cases [of violence against women], the common thread is not that we are drinking too much. The fact that we continue to minimise and rationalise violence is so insanely damaging. This is not an intellectual conversation; it\u2019s not a time for posturing. And it\u2019s not OK that, in Gladwell\u2019s book, I was treated and regarded as a case, as something locked in, and not as a person who is actively functioning and speaking and writing and prepared to provide my opinion.\u201d\n\nShe says: \u201cYou have trolls, then you have this very sophisticated way [of writing]; it\u2019s the same amount of damage, but disguised as this reasonable [critique]. It\u2019s so easy for someone to copy and paste these sections from the transcript, to take my statement and analyse it however they may please, but it\u2019s so difficult to live it. I\u2019m not interested in making excuses any more. When a drunk man beats a woman, we don\u2019t say: well the alcohol affected his decision-making. You\u2019re accountable for that behaviour. It\u2019s a crime.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s infuriating how much victims have to sacrifice, how we have to speak in gruesome detail about private things\n\nOver the past 18 months, Miller has been emboldened to speak out and ultimately shed her anonymity by the examples of the women testifying against Harvey Weinstein, and by Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony against Justice Brett Kavanaugh. \u201cI watched them literally sacrifice themselves for the greater good, with the single hope that it\u2019s going to help someone. It\u2019s infuriating when we see how much victims have to sacrifice and give away from themselves, and how much we have to speak in gruesome detail about things that feel very private, in order to make this apparent to people. How many times we\u2019re caught in that cycle of saying: \u2018Doesn\u2019t this mean something to you? Why can\u2019t you see me? Why doesn\u2019t this hurt you? Why aren\u2019t you alarmed?\u2019 Each one has propelled me forward, and has cleared out a little more space in order for me to step out today. I think it would have been a much slower process for me coming to terms with going public had they not laid that groundwork.\u201d\n\nDoes she think Kavanaugh should be impeached? Miller smiles. \u201cI think a lot about that. Hmmm. I think when Christine Blasey Ford or Debbie Ramirez comes forward with their story, it is our job to create a space for them to speak the truth without being automatically converted into political punching bags. And, yes, I do think that people in power need to be held to a higher standard of behaviour. So many of these conversations feel so absurd.\u201d\n\nThe point about gruesome detail is particularly relevant in Miller\u2019s case; she writes about how it felt to discover, after the fact, that a huge closeup of her exposed genitals had been flashed before the court as part of the presentation of evidence, moments before she walked in to testify. To attach her name to that image; to invite people to imagine her being assaulted was grotesque and terrifying and, in the first instance, she says: \u201cAnonymity was essential to self-preservation and processing.\u201d She was also fearful for her safety. At every stage of the trial and its aftermath, she has received death and rape threats from random men set on defending Turner online.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chanel Miller.

Shame loves growing in a contained environment, that\u2019s the only way it can fester and thrive. You have to let your story breathe in order for some of that shame to be cleared out.\u201d\n\nThe panic attacks have not gone away, and neither has the depression. She is still subject to bouts of anger and despair. At the end of the trial, Turner\u2019s father read out a statement in which he said harsh punishment of his son would be \u201ca steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of his 20-plus years of life\u201d. Those 20 minutes have cost Miller most of her 20s.\n\nShe tries to be gentle with herself, and to \u201caccept this is going to dominate major chunks of my life\u201d. She has also come to understand that what happens now \u201cis not eternally out of my control. I\u2019ve realised that each time I revisit this story, I\u2019m changing. And I\u2019m growing stronger, and becoming more clear-headed and assertive and articulate. So I\u2019m not wasting time by returning to the story; that is my way of moving forward. Once I realised that, I could breathe a little easier.\u201d\n\nBesides which, she says: \u201cThere are no deadlines for healing. Ultimately this experience will always be a part of you, but you get to choose how it serves you; what you draw from it. I get to use my anger as fuel, I get to use my grief as strength, and my ability to empathise with anyone who\u2019s going through this; I\u2019m thankful for the ability to do that.\u201d\n\nThe awful truth is that by the standards of most women who are raped or sexually assaulted, Miller\u2019s has been a \u201cgood\u201d experience; according to some analyses of Justice Department data, fewer than 1% of rapes in the US result in felony convictions. Turner was found guilty of sexual assault with intent to rape and, after a campaign online, the judge responsible for his light sentence was removed. Miller had sympathetic cops and a great district attorney. She was one of the lucky ones. To which she can only laugh and say, as women have been saying repeatedly for years: \u201cIf this is what\u2019s considered a smooth trajectory through the system, it is my duty to report that it\u2019s not working.\u201d", "description": "After she was assaulted while unconscious, Miller\u2019s life split in two.
