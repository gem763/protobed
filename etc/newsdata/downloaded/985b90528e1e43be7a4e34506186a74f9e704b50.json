We assure you that mitigation strategies are being put in place as required,\u201d she said in a statement on Monday.\n\nA clearer picture has also emerged of the internal RCMP investigation \u2013 dubbed Project Ace \u2013 that led police to arrest Ortis, the highest-ranking civilian in the organization.\n\n\n\nThe search for the mole began after US police arrested Canadian citizen Vincent Ramos, the CEO of a Vancouver company which sold modified Blackberry devices to organized crime rings, including the Sinaloa drug cartel. According to the US department of justice, Ramos made more than $80m between 2008 and 2018.\n\n\n\nRamos was charged with conspiring to distribute narcotics and racketeering and after pleading guilty in October, was sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy then, investigators had discovered internal RCMP documents on Ramos\u2019s laptop, prompting the separate inquiry to find the source of the leak. By May, digital evidence led Canadian police to Ortis, a longtime academic who oversaw and coordinated the relationship between the country\u2019s intelligence service and the country\u2019s police force.\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Ortis spent nearly a decade at the University of British Columbia, researching cybersecurity and developing an interest in Asia, before becoming an an adviser to the Canadian government in 2007.\n\nOrtis faces five charges under Canada\u2019s Security of Information Act, as well as the two under the Criminal Code, all in relation to alleged incidents that occurred between 2015 and 2019. If convicted, he could spend 14 years in prison.\n\nOrtis appeared by video link in an Ottawa court on 13 September is set to appear again in court on Friday to determine bail eligibility.", "description": "Theft of classified information by a senior intelligence officer could \u2018cause grave injury to Canada\u2019s national interests\u2019", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1adce5ce3ad4ea28e3b0bf699d3c8178a9dc78f4/0_67_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0fa3e20f354bdcf68dab55a9ba873e75", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
