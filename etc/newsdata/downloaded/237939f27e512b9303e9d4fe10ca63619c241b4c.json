Some\n\nshuffled with their ankles manacled and others were chained by\n\ntheir legs to large metal wheels to prevent escape.\n\nOne boy, held by the hand by a police officer as he walked\n\nunsteadily, had sores visible on his back that appeared\n\nconsistent with injuries inflicted by a whip.\n\nSome children had been brought from neighbouring countries\n\nincluding Burkina Faso, Mali and Ghana, police said, while\n\nothers had been left by their parents in what they believed to\n\nbe an Islamic school or rehabilitation centre.\n\n\"This place is neither a rehab or an Islamic school because\n\nyou can see it for yourselves,\" Kaduna state's police\n\ncommissioner, Ali Janga, told reporters. \"The children gathered\n\nhere are from all over the country... some of them were even\n\nchained. They were used, dehumanized, you can see it yourself.\"\n\nKaduna police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said seven people who\n\nsaid they were teachers at the school had been arrested in\n\nThursday's raid.\n\n\"The state government is currently providing food to the\n\nchildren who are between the ages of five and above,\" he said.\n\nIt was not clear how long the captives had been held there.\n\nRELATIVES SUSPICIOUS\n\nReports carried by local media said the captives had been\n\ntortured, starved and sexually abused. Reuters was not\n\nimmediately able to confirm those details.\n\nOne young man, Hassan Yusuf, said he had been sent to the\n\nschool because of concerns about his way of life following a few\n\nyears studying abroad.\n\n\"They said my lifestyle has changed - I've become a\n\nChristian, I've left the Islamic way of life,\" said Yusuf, who\n\ndid not specify the nature of his relationship with the people\n\nwho sent him to the centre.\n\nAs news of the raid spread, some relatives gathered near the\n\ncompound, where a sign over the gate, topped with rolls of\n\nbarbed wire, read: \"Imam Ahmad Bun Hambal Centre for Islamic\n\nstudies\".\n\nHassan Mohammed, told Reuters he was the uncle of three of\n\nthe freed children who had been sent to the school by their\n\nmother after their father died. He said he grew suspicious about\n\nwhat was going on after the family was denied access to them.\n\n\"I begged, they said no, we can't see these children until\n\nthree months. When we went back home... we said the only thing\n\nnow is we should report this issue to the police station, that\n\nis exactly what we did,\" said Mohammed.\n\nThe rescued children have been moved to a temporary camp at\n\na stadium in Kaduna, and would later be moved to another camp in\n\na suburb of the city while attempts were made to find their\n\nparents, police said.\n\n\n\nSCHOOL SHUTDOWNS?\n\nIslamic schools, known as Almajiris, are common across the\n\nmostly Muslim north of Nigeria - a country that is roughly\n\nevenly split between followers of Christianity and Islam.\n\nParents in northern Nigeria, the poorest part of a country\n\nin which most people live on less than $2 a day, often opt to\n\nleave their children to board at the schools.\n\nSuch schools have for years been dogged by allegations of\n\nabuse and accusations that some children have been forced to beg\n\non the streets of cities in the north.\n\nEarlier this year, the government of President Muhammadu\n\nBuhari, himself a Muslim, said it planned to eventually ban the\n\nschools, but would not do so immediately.\n\n\"Any necessary ban on Almajiri would follow due process and\n\nconsultation with relevant authorities,\" said Buhari's spokesman\n\nGarba Shehu in a statement issued in June.\n\n\"The federal government wants a situation where every child\n\nof primary school age is in school rather than begging on the\n\nstreets during school hours,\" the statement said.\n\nA presidency spokesman did not immediately respond to calls\n\nand text messages seeking comment on the raid in Kaduna and\n\nwhether it would alter the government's approach to such\n\nschools.\n\nProfessor Ishaq Akintola, director of the Nigerian human\n\nrights organisation the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), said\n\naround 10 million children across the north of the country are\n\neducated at Islamic schools.\n\n\"Those responsible for abuse, if found guilty, should be\n\nheld accountable but these schools should continue because\n\nshutting them down would deprive so many students of an\n\neducation,\" he said.\n\nAkintola said Islamic schools needed funding to train\n\nteachers and improve the buildings.\n\n\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 4-\"Used and dehumanised\": Dozens of boys found chained in Nigeria", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_3_800x533_L_1412601605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
