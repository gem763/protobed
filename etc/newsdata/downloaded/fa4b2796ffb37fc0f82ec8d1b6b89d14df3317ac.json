(Parwiz/Reuters)\n\nVoters trickled into polling stations across the jittery Afghan capital Saturday morning, as violence struck several locations across the country. One person died in an explosion in eastern Jalalabad province, 15 were wounded in a polling site bombing in southern Kandahar province, and two were wounded in minor attacks in Kabul.\n\nMany voters in the fourth presidential election since the end of Taliban rule in 2001 appeared to be staying away from the polls, which the insurgents had repeatedly vowed to attack. The two main contenders are President Ashraf Ghani, who is seeking a second 5-year term, and Abdullah Abdullah, the government\u2019s chief executive, who also ran against him in the 2014 election.\n\nThe capital was blanketed by police, and security cordons were set up around each polling place, sometimes several blocks away. Many streets were blocked by cargo or police trucks, and security personnel searched passing vehicles, as well as all voters who approached the polling places on foot.\n\nGhani, 70, cast his ballot soon after the polls opened, at a fortified high school near his palace. His wife Rula and his top running-mate, Amrullah Salah, voted there with him. The president then declared, \u201cwe are waiting for the decision of the people as to whether they will give us the authority \u2026 to bring peace on the basis of the Afghan people\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\n[Afghan election challenger warns of dire consequences if polls marred by fraud]\n\nThe election, which had been delayed twice, came weeks after negotiations collapsed between U.S. and Taliban leaders. It is seen by officials, and by many voters, as a key step toward beginning peace talks with the Taliban, which has been waging an especially aggressive and violent campaign in recent months.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic chance for the country that won\u2019t come again,\u201d said Abdul Mohammed Abdali, 25, a business student, after he emerged from voting at another Kabul high school with his forefinger dipped in purple ink. \u201cIt is time for Afghans to sit down together and stop killing each other.\u201d\n\nAbdul Nazari, 67, a retired security officer who voted in a Shiite mosque in the minority ethnic Hazara district of west Kabul, said he had no fear of the Taliban, \u201ceven if they set off a bomb down the street. The Taliban failed this country and closed the door on education,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been waiting for this day to bring change and opportunity for Afghans, especially the young.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfghan Sikhs show their inked fingers after casting their votes at a polling station in the city of Jalalabad, east of Kabul, Afghanistan, Sept. 28, 2019. (Mohammad Anwar Danishyar/AP)\n\nFew voters Saturday expressed concerns about fraud, although Abdullah and other opponents had warned that Ghani would attempt to rig the vote by paying off local officials and other abuses of power. Both U.N. officials here, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, issued strong statements this week saying they expected the election to be fair and transparent.\n\nThe short lines in voting centers, largely due to fear of attack, aroused some concerns that the turnout would be only a fraction of the 6.9 million registered voters, making the vote less credible. But the speedy voting process, a result of technical improvements in voter identification, also appeared to lower voters\u2019 worries about ballot-box fraud.\n\n\u201cThis is 100 percent better than last time,\u201d said Hakimullah Azizi, 50, a poll monitor working his third election. \u201cThere are no crowds, no delays, and people are leaving happy.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah holds up his ink-stained finger as he casts his vote at a polling station in Kabul, Afghanistan Sept. 28, 2019. (Omar Sobhani/Reuters)\n\nIn other cases, though, familiar glitches left frustrated citizens wandering from room to room in schoolhouse poll centers, unable to find their name on any registration list. One was a turbaned truck driver named Sadruddin, 60, who left a poll center in the Kabul suburbs a huff after failing to find his name.\n\n\u201cLast year, I voted in this same school. There was a suicide bombing outside, and when I ran out I saw bodies everywhere,\u201d he said, referring to the violence-plagued parliamentary elections in October. \u201cThis time I came back, because we need to choose a leader and we need to bring peace, so we can walk freely again. I am very disappointed,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite fears of violence, women voted in unexpectedly large numbers. In southwest Kabul at the Nabi Akram mosque, a young woman who gave her name as Sajaya, 18, searched and patted down a steady line of women entering to vote in a separate section from the men. She said she planned to vote later in the day.\n\n\u201cI am very optimistic about the election,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course I am worried about the Taliban like everyone else, but I trust and believe this election will start negotiations with them.\u201d Asked about the chances of fraud, she said, \u201call of the people hate cheating, and the people will make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nSayed Salahuddin and Sharif Hassan contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nTaliban threats, poll closures raise fears for credibility of Afghan elections\n\nEven as rallies are bombed, Afghanistan\u2019s Ghani plows ahead with a populist campaign\n\nWith U.S.-Taliban peace talks canceled, Afghan president is on the hot seat\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The vote is seen by the government as a key step toward peace talks with the Taliban insurgents.", "authors": ["Pamela Constable", "Foreign Correspondent Covering Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "South Asia", "Latin America", "Susannah George", "Foreign Reporter Covering Afghanistan", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/N_qe5lKT6zGmqfWl3IWmkkIpKSI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OMCH7QHBWII6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
