After nine eliminations, it\u2019s time for a winner to be crowned as this 10th series of The Great British Bake Off draws to a close. As is customary on the show, three bakers are left vying for the final prize: Alice, the 28-year-old geography teacher, Steph, the 28-year-old shop assistant who has won the Star Baker title an impressive four times, and David, a 36-year-old health adviser \u2013 and a skilled baker who has somehow consistently missed out on the Star Baker honour.\n\nUnlike other Bake Off episodes, the final doesn\u2019t have a theme tying all three challenges together. Instead, judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith are free to pick whichever bakes they view as the biggest curveballs for the three finalists.\n\nIt\u2019s off to an exciting start with the signature challenge, during which the bakers are asked to create the \u201cultimate chocolate cake\u201d in just two hours. I might be biased, as a huge advocate of chocolate in all its forms, but this is a genuinely interesting bake. While a chocolate cake might sound easy on the surface, it\u2019s hard to get the texture and the flavour right. Specifically, it\u2019s tricky to hit that perfect balance between fudgy and cakey, and for some reason it\u2019s surprisingly difficult to make a chocolate cake actually taste like chocolate. (I know all this, by the way, from eating many chocolate cakes, not from baking them.)\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nDavid opts for a chocolate Armagnac and prune cake with a mirror glaze. Alice goes for a chocolate, pear, maple and ginger cake, while Steph\u2019s pick is a classic Black Forest gateau. Choosing to craft such an uncool (I say this with love, I for one love Black Forest cake), retro confection (the popularity of Black Forest cake famously peaked in the Eighties) for the Bake Off finale is clearly an act of bravery.\n\nCome judging time, it turns out that David\u2019s cake, while beautiful, tastes a little too strongly of Armagnac for Hollywood and Leith\u2019s tastes, while Alice\u2019s bake tastes good but looks \u201ca bit clumsy\u201d, according to Leith. Steph\u2019s Black Forest gateau is a bit overbaked, but its rich cocoa flavour and neat architecture mean that Steph makes it out of the signature challenge slightly ahead of her two fellow finalists.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Meet the new Bake Off contestants 1/13 Henry Age: 20 Job: Student Lives in: Durham Bio: Henry became interested in all things culinary and baking at the age of 12, as he was intrigued by the Bake Off tent that was pitched up in his local park. He started experimenting in the kitchen and supplied his family, friends and teachers with a variety of bakes. Now studying English literature at Durham University, he enjoys feeding his housemates with his creations. Baking style: He is fond of elegant bakes composed of delicate and carefully combined flavours. He says: \"I have wanted to get into the tent since series two. They filmed it at the end of my road, so I used to see Paul Hollywood when I walked past the tent to go to school in the mornings, so I really got into it. To be inside the actual tent was totally wonderful.\" C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA Wire 2/13 Phil Age: 56 Job: HGV driver Lives in: Rainham Bio: This year's oldest competitor, Phil took up baking seriously six years ago, but was always fond of baking bread in his home economics classes in his school days. Regularly baking four or five times a week, he focuses on breads such as focaccia, granary and brioche, but he also likes trying pastry and relishes the challenge of hot-water crust, puff and choux. Baking style: A fan of breads in particular, he also spends time perfecting the art of decoration and piping, crafting delicately decorated cakes. He says: \"The most surprised [that I am in Bake Off] will be a couple who are long-term friends and they had been staying with us recently and said you make such wonderful cakes, but have never mentioned to me that I should go on Bake Off, so I think they haven't a clue that I would be in it.\" C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA Wire 3/13 Rosie Age: 28 Job: Veterinary surgeon Lives in: Somerset Bio: Rosie's passion for baking started when she was given a baking book at the age of five, and it has continued into her adult life. When she is not treating sick animals, she can be found baking through the night to unwind and also to keep the practice nurses well-fed. The amateur baker grew up in Oxfordshire and studied at Cambridge, is married to her childhood sweetheart and has many animals, including ducks and chickens. Baking style: She enjoys patisserie and her baking is inspired by her rural surroundings. She says: \"The nurses at work are going to be so surprised, they will have no idea. They asked me the other day would I apply again and I could honestly and categorically answer, no I don't think I will!\" C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA Wire 4/13 Alice Age: 28 Job: Geography teacher Lives in: London Bio: Alice started baking at the age of 15 when a back operation for scoliosis left her unable to do sport. She lived in New Zealand in her early twenties, where she studied art and also perfected the art of a pavlova, before returning to the UK to become a geography teacher. She now uses her cakes in her lessons, demonstrating natural events such as coastal erosion and volcanic activity with her edible creations. Baking style: She is keen on intricate and delicate bakes, full of flavour and enthusiasm and aiming to impress. She says: \"I have wanted to be in Bake Off ever since the show has started, but I wasn't really good enough when I was 18. To be on such a big show doing something that you are passionate about is a huge thing. I also felt that to be accepted into the tent gave me the confidence to feel that I could bake. It was a dream come true!\" C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA Wire 5/13 Michael Age: 26 Job: Theatre manager and fitness instructor Lives in: Stratford-upon-Avon Bio: Michael was taught to bake by his mother using old, handwritten recipes passed down from her grandparents. Born in Newcastle, he was raised in Scone in Scotland from the age of seven and later studied in Edinburgh, and he considers himself Scottish. He currently works as a manager at a theatre company in Stratford-upon-Avon. Baking style: He is inspired by the flavours of his Indian heritage and, although he has attempted nearly every discipline in baking, his strengths are in cakes and pastry. He says: \"This was the very first time that I applied, one night I applied as I was a bit bored, I never thought I would get to the audition process. So when I found out it was a mixture of shock and blind panic!\" C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA Wire 6/13 Priya Age: 34 Job: Marketing consultant Lives in: Leicester Bio: Priya, a self-professed perfectionist, started to take baking seriously 10 years ago as a means to relax, but her first foray into baking was in her youth at a baking club at primary school. A wedding present of a stand mixer seven years ago only boosted her passion even more, and she is known to toil for hours into the night baking bread and also for delivering bags of tasty treats to friends and family. She lives in Leicester with her husband and their two children. Baking style: Priya has recently started experimenting with vegan bakes. She says: \"I downloaded the application for Bake Off in 2012 the year I got married but I thought I would never get in. I applied again last year, and then this year I got in and it was so dreamy and unreal. I was in no doubt it would change my life. And it taught me to pursue the things you love, and you just have to go for it.\" C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA Wire 7/13 Helena Age: 40 Job: Online project manager Lives in: Leeds Bio: Helena's introduction to baking came at a young age as she watched her Spanish grandmother in the kitchen, but it was moving to Las Vegas and living with a Mormon family for a school exchange trip that prompted her to start baking herself. Born in Ceuta \u2013 an autonomous Spanish city on the north coast of Africa \u2013 Helen was raised in Lanzarote and studied in mainland Spain, but now lives in Leeds with her husband and baby daughter. Baking style: A fan of using American flavours such as pumpkin, pecans and maple, Helena also enjoys using Spanish flavours and is often inspired by Halloween in her bakes. She says: \"I won a baking competition at work and that gave me the confidence to apply. Although when I learned that I had got in I had a bit of a confidence crisis thinking, can I possibly be good enough?\" PAC4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA Wire 8/13 David Age: 36 Job: International health adviser Lives in: London Bio: Having grown up in rural Yorkshire with a mother who would always bake and refuse to buy a loaf from the shops, Dan was inspired to bake as a child. He became further interested in the art of baking after travelling to Malawi with his job as a health adviser, where he learnt to build an oven out of an oil drum and invented a cake that could steam cook over a village fire. He studied art and design before switching to nursing, and enjoys cycling and ceramics. Baking style: His strengths lie in baking bread and he prefers robust flavours and solid bakes to fancy, colourful icings. He says: \"I have watched Bake Off from the start, and I have daydreamed so many times walking to work about being in it for such a long time. And when I got accepted it was such a mixture of emotions. Then I thought this is really crazy, am I good enough, will I have enough time to practice?\" C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA Wire 9/13 Michelle Age: 35 Job: Print shop administrator Lives in: Tenby, Wales Bio: Michelle, who grew up on a farm, has been a lover of baking since she was a child, watching her mother whip up traditional bakes. She now bakes almost every other day, whether it is a loaf of bread or a dessert for her husband and teenage son. Baking style: Experimental flavour combinations are key, as well as the inclusion of seasonable vegetables and local produce, with a precise and finessed edge. C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA Wire 10/13 Amelia Age: 24 Job: Fashion designer Lives in: London Bio: Born to a Caribbean father and a half-British/half-Polish mother, Amelia has been baking for 19 years after watching her mother and grandmother creating beautiful cake decorations as a child. She grew up in Halifax and studied in Leeds and Leicester, and honed her baking skills while at university, baking for friends and college fundraising events. She currently lives in London and works as a sportswear designer. Baking style: Inspired by her northern roots, she believes that freshly farmed produce is essential for a satisfying bake. She says: \"I have wanted to get into the tent since series one. It's still not sunk in, but it's a dream come true.\" C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA Wire 11/13 Jamie Age: 20 Job: Part-time waiter Lives in: Surrey Bio: Jamie was taught the basics by his grandmother and his parents, but it was after watching an episode of Bake Off and being inspired to make a plaited loaf that really saw his baking passion take hold. He was born and raised in Surrey with his identical twin and currently has a job as a part-time waiter before studying sports science at university. Baking style: He is not afraid to tackle more technically challenging bakes such as croquembouches and croissants, but has a fairly traditional approach to flavours. He says: \"When they called to tell me it was a real shock, I really wasn't expecting it at all. But a nice shock. All my mates don't even know that I bake so they will get a shock to see me in an apron!\" C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA Wire 12/13 Dan Age: 32 Job: Support worker Lives in: Rotherham Bio: Dan says he is largely a self-taught baker, but has memories of watching his mother bake a Victoria sponge as a child and his Army chef father coming to his school to teach how to bake and plait bread. He became serious about baking at the age of 21 while trying to impress his girlfriend Laura, who is now his wife, with a themed birthday cake. Dan, who lives with Laura and their three dogs, even made their wedding cake. Baking style: He is a fan of the decorating process and he loves to produce awe-inspiring bakes. He says: \"I have been trying for a few years now, so finally I am here. It's absolutely crazy, really amazing, I was so adamant to get on, it's very hard to describe the feelings, all strange and surreal. And then when you are in the tent it all feels normal pretty quickly.\" C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA Wire 13/13 Steph Age: 28 Job: Shop assistant Lives in: Chester Bio: Steph took up baking when her grandfather inspired her thanks to his love of homemade bread. Although it has long been a hobby of hers, she really became serious around three years ago and is largely self-taught. She lives in Chester with her mother, and her passion for sports and wellness inspires her in the kitchen as she enjoys making healthier bakes, adding vegetables and fruit and lowering the refined sugar content and upping nutritional fats. Baking style: She is particularly fond of biscuits, but her signature bake is a sourdough load using her starter, affectionately called Sammy. She says: \"It's a bit like a lottery, it wasn't really joined up thinking, I didn't think that I would get in, I wanted to give it a go. It's just beyond anything that I can imagine, because I didn't really dream that I would get in, it has been the most incredible surreal experience.\" C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA Wire 1/13 Henry Age: 20 Job: Student Lives in: Durham Bio: Henry became interested in all things culinary and baking at the age of 12, as he was intrigued by the Bake Off tent that was pitched up in his local park.

Hollywood wants the bakers to whip up stilton souffles with snappy biscuits on the side \u2013 so far, so good, but the souffles must for some reason be served out of the dishes they\u2019re baked in. I\u2019m no expert, but I am 1) French, and 2) able to search \u201cstilton souffles\u201d on Google Images, and although stilton souffles do appear to be served out of their dishes every once in a great while, this presentation appears to be the exception, not the rule. Souffles at large are typically served inside the dish, and in fact, the American food writer Amanda Hesser wrote in The New York Times in 2000: \u201cAny failed souffle can simply be turned out of its dish and served without shame, like an unmolded custard\u201d \u2013 suggesting that if you have to take your souffle out of its dish, then it means your souffle is a failed one.\n\nAll this to say, it\u2019s a little rattling to watch Hollywood, a man who has the nerve to serve souffles out of their dishes without any justification whatsoever, judge other people\u2019s souffle skills. Nevertheless, judges render their opinions and Steph comes last while Alice is second, meaning David emerges as the winner of this technical challenge.\n\nThe challenges, by the way, are interspersed with sequences that see the three bakers\u2019 loved ones reflect on their journey towards the final. This serves a double purpose: fill some airtime, since the final must last about an hour even though there are only three people left in the running, and raise the emotional stakes by showing us what a potential victory would mean for each baker. In a touching segment, Steph\u2019s mum informs us that her daughter was \u201cnot in a good place this time last year\u201d and was struggling to figure out what to do with her life \u2013 until she found solace in cooking. These segments serve as a reminder of Bake Off\u2019s biggest strength, which has enabled it to stand out from other TV contests: its ability to be unabashedly genuine and to delve into its participants\u2019 emotional vulnerability with kindness.\n\nSpeaking of emotional vulnerability, it\u2019s time for the showstopper challenge, and poor Alice is worried sick. While finalists typically get to walk out of the tent at the end of the final to be greeted by their families and friends, Alice\u2019s parents are stuck in Ireland due to a cancelled flight and might not be able to make it back to England on time. Through tears, Alice progresses through the challenge, for which the bakers must create a deceptive picnic basket and its contents, meaning \u2013 as explained by co-hosts Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig \u2013 that each element must look like one kind of food but taste like another (for example, the bakers may craft cheese-shaped biscuits). Oh, and each basket must contain variations of cake, enriched bread, and biscuits.\n\nThe showstoppers, naturally, are marvels of creativity. David somehow crafts peaches out of spiced bread, cheese out of lemon cake, and sausage rolls out of fig rolls. Alice makes strawberries out of raspberry macarons, ice cream cones out of bread buns, and a pork pie, chicken drumsticks, and scotch eggs out of carrot cake. Steph goes for fairy cakes made out of bread buns, strawberries made out of macarons, and an impressive chicken burger consisting of lemon-poppyseed cake.\n\nThis finally brings us to the big reveal we've all been waiting for, as Leith and Hollywood pick (drum roll, please)... David as the winner of this year's series! There's no doubt in my mind that the verdict will elicit a lot of reactions on social media, but the fact that David was never crowned Star Baker throughout his time on the show, establishing himself as this year's underdog before rising as the programme's champion, has a daring, rather pleasant edge to it. Congratulations, David, and until next time!", "description": "In the words of the singer Shania Twain, it looks like we\u2019ve made it!
