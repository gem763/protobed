England are up and running at Japan 2019, though their 35-3 victory over Tonga last Sunday was hardly impressive and a big improvement will be needed as the tournament wears on. Eddie Jones has been keen to stress that this week, but he also knows that the four-day turnaround for today's match will require fresh legs, so a number of changes have been made to the starting line-up with the Australian making full use of his 31-man squad. USA meanwhile are preparing to make their World Cup bow as the final team to begin their campaign, having received a bye in round one of the pool stages. In truth, the US will be eyeing an upset against one of the big three and a win over Tonga in their pool stage to try and seal third place and automatic qualification for the 2023 World Cup - but who knows, this is the best US team to arrive at a World Cup and one that for the first time is fully professional.
