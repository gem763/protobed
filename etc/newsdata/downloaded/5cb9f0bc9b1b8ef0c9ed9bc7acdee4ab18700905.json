Andrew Ryu has stepped down from his role as Chief Executive Officer and will assume the position as the Company\u2019s Chairman. Jeff Stevens has stepped down as Chief Operating Officer, but will continue as President, focussing on Capital Markets and Business Development.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese management changes are inline with the company\u2019s strategy to focus on operations and drive growth in both revenue and share price,\u201d says Charles Schade, independent director.\n\nMr. Gunter\u2019s engineering background is rooted in big data analysis and machine learning at scale. Working with Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners, Marshall was responsible for bringing Varagesale to the mass market. Marshall took Varagesale from a one room shop to a powerhouse engineering department of 60 plus people and played a leading role in their $35-million-dollar raise. Marshall led the team that built iSentium\u2019s sentiment engine. iSentium uses patented Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract sentiment from unstructured social content then instantly transforms it into highly actionable indicators in finance, brand management and politics, handling billions of data points to harness the power of the masses as they tweet and text.\n\n\u201cI am honoured to take on the CEO role at Datametrex. Having joined Nexalogy in April of 2018 as CTO, I was excited to lead the engineering team in developing best in class products for social discovery. I then took on the CEO position at Nexalogy in January of 2019 to restructure the company and focus on revenue and new product development. I look forward to taking my experience and passion for the technology into my new role as CEO of Datametrex. I believe this transition should demonstrate to the markets that Datametrex is focused on being dominant player in the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning industry,\u201d said Marshall Gunter, CEO of the Company.\n\n\u201cMarshall taking the CEO role of Datametrex is a key strategic move for the growth of the company. I am very proud of what we have accomplished since founding the company and feel confident that the time is right to step aside and have an industry expert take on the CEO role. Marshall\u2019s leadership style, industry expertise, and market understanding will help drive growth and shareholder value,\u201d said Andrew Ryu.\n\n\u201cAs a founder of the company, acknowledging the correct time to step aside and make room for industry experts to lead is key for growth and prosperity. I look forward to working with Marshall as CEO and will support him in all Business Development and Capital Market endeavors,\u201d said Jeff Stevens.\n\nFor more information on this project or to learn how Datametrex can assist your organization in social media discovery, Fake News Filters and BOT detection please go to: www.nexalogy.com\n\nAbout Datametrex\n\nDatametrex AI Limited is a technology focused company with exposure to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning through its wholly owned subsidiary, Nexalogy ( www.nexalogy.com ).\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nJeff Stevens - President & COO\n\nPhone: (416) 482-3282\n\nEmail: jstevens@datametrex.com\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis news release contains \u201cforward-looking information\u201d within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
