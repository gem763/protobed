Does that mean she'll hold off on the impeachment talk for a moment? Well, watch for yourself. pic.twitter.com/e8NXlSCugH \u2014 Townhall.com (@townhallcom) September 25, 2019\n\n\"I haven\u2019t seen it,\" Pelosi admitted. But, \"the fact is that the president of the United States, in breach of his constitutional responsibilities, has asked a foreign government to help his political campaign at the expense of our national security.\"\n\nThe supposed damning conversation between Trump and Zelensky, in which the former reportedly threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine if Zelensky didn't agree to investigate Joe Biden, was used as ammunition for Pelosi and the Democrats to announce a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday. Again, they hadn't heard the phone call or seen the transcript.\n\nFox News reporter John Roberts was confused.\n\n\"She said, 'I haven't seen the transcript,' and then proceeds to condemn the president based on a transcript that she hasn't read,\" he reminded viewers on Wednesday following Pelosi's hasty conclusion.\n\nWhen she does read it (she can do so here), she'll see that Trump did ask Zelensky to investigate the Biden scandal, but he did not mention anything about withholding military aid. Also, he did not ask about Biden eight times as originally reported.", "description": ".09/25/2019 19:24:46PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/4eac3f1e-f209-4120-b351-68e1cf258b71.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
