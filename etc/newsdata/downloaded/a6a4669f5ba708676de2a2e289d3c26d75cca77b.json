There\u2019s a lot of talk in Washington about Trump trying to goose the economy with either Keynesian monetary policy or Keynesian fiscal policy.\n\nIt would be much better, as I discuss in this interview with Yahoo Finance, if Trump instead declared a ceasefire in the trade wars he\u2019s started.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interview largely revolved around trade policy and monetary policy, so I was mostly critical of Trump.\n\nBut I want to focus on the point I made midway through the discussion, when I said that Trump is undermining and offsetting some of his Administration\u2019s good policies \u2013 most notably tax reform and regulatory easing.\n\nAs an economist, I\u2019m frustrated by this inconsistency. It\u2019s akin to a watching a kid get good grades in some classes and bad grades in others (and I worry his GPA is declining).\n\nThough I suppose I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. This is what the theory of \u201cpublic choice\u201d tells us to expect.\n\nI can only imagine, though, how frustrating this must be for Republican political operatives. They\u2019re focused on winning in 2020 and the President is sabotaging that goal with bad trade policy.\n\nP.S. Toward the end of the interview, I pointed out that Trump should have gone through the World Trade Organization in his effort to curtail China\u2019s protectionism. When the history of the Trump presidency is written, I suspect this will be viewed as a major mistake.", "description": "I\u2019m worried.
