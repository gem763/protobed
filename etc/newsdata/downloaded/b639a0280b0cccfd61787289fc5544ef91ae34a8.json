As youngsters they were inseparable and always up to mischief.\n\n\"That broke me, really broke me. \u2018It was the first time in six weeks I\u2019ve really cried \u2014 really, really cried. There have been little breakdowns but we've all had to try to be stoic for Niall.\n\n(Image: Peter Summers)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"Bless his heart, he\u2019s said it really upsets him to see us upset so we\u2019ve had to be strong for him.\"\n\nNow the parents are flying to the US this weekend to fight for a face-to-face meeting with President Trump .\n\nEarlier this week Trump waded into the international diplomatic immunity row and was condemned for his clumsy analysis of Harry\u2019s death.\n\nBut in a follow up press conference the US leader softened his stance, revealing Sacoolas was \u201cbeing spoken to\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019re trying to work something out.\u201d\n\n(Image: JIM LO SCALZO/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n(Image: Justice4Harry)\n\nThey will continue their fight for justice by giving interviews on major news channels.\n\nLawyer Radd Seiger, who is representing the family, is understood to have arrived in Washington DC last night for talks. He said: \u201cBringing her back to Britain is our priority.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson revealed that this is unlikely.\n\nHe said: \u201cAmerica is reluctant to allow its nationals to be tried overseas. We\u2019ve got to keep working to get justice for Harry.\u201d", "description": "The teen died when his motorbike was struck by a car driven by Anne Sacoolas - who has since claimed diplomatic immunity", "authors": ["Sam Elliott", "Image", "Sky", "Peter Summers", "Pa", "Jim Lo Scalzo Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20537380.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Harry-Dunn-victim-of-fatal-car-accident.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
