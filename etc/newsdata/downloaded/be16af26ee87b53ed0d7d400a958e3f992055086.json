A coastguard helicopter has been hovering close to the chimney top with police, fire and ambulance services on the scene below.\n\nNaim Asghar (@naim_asghar) Poor man still stuck at Dixon chimney.Police have been trying to bring him down since 2:50 am but no luck so https://t.co/fQC9xi0fVx just goes on to show that carlisle city council needs to be more resourceful when it comes to handling emergencies like this pic.twitter.com/KRhDSIy9IA\n\nThere is no information on how, or why, the man came to be trapped. Roads around the structure, a prominent local landmark built in 1836, have been closed.\n\nLocal reports said shouts and wailing could be heard from the chimney in the early hours of Monday before police arrived. As early morning mist cleared, the figure could be seen at the top.\n\nJohn McVay, an area manager at Cumbria fire and rescue service, said: \u201cThis is a very complex and difficult process given the obvious dangers to the man and the extreme difficulty in gaining access to him in a way which will keep him and emergency services safe.\n\n\u201cI can assure the public that the emergency services are working tirelessly and effectively together to resolve this issue safely for all and that the protection of life is our first priority.\n\n\u201cI ask people impacted by the incident and the road closures to continue to show patience. I\u2019d also like to ask anyone who has a cherry picker in excess of 90 metres within Cumbria to please contact Cumbria police or Cumbria fire and rescue service on 999.\u201d", "description": "Appeal for cherry picker after man seen hanging upside down at top of 80m-tall structure", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7f7f8b140f672cf8d44b3169efa10398e7c7c12/142_189_3180_1908/master/3180.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=693d1a2fccbde410e11f77fa28b44f9a", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
