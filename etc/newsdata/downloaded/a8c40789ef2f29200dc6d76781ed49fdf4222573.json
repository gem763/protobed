It was the lowest reading since June 2013, when the currency area\u2019s economy was starting to emerge from a government debt and banking crisis. A reading above 50.0 points to an increase in activity, while a reading below that level points to a decline.\n\nServices account for 73% of economic activity in the eurozone, a smaller share than in the U.S., where they account for four-fifths of output.\n\nIHS Markit said the composite PMIs for the three months of the third quarter point to growth of just 0.1% \u201cat best.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe risk of recession is now very real,\u201d said Chris Williamson, IHS Markit\u2019s chief business economist.\n\nAround the world, policy makers have been cutting their key interest rates since April, with both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank easing policy in September. The ECB tried to prevent contagion from the manufacturing sector to other parts of the economy by launching a package of new stimulus measures.\n\nGermany, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy and an export powerhouse, is the eurozone\u2019s weak spot. Its central bank has acknowledged the economy may have entered recession in the third quarter, while its leading economic institutes Wednesday cut their growth forecast for this year to 0.5% from 0.8% previously.\n\n\u201cGerman industry is in recession, and this is now also impacting the service providers catering to those companies,\u201d said Claus Michelsen, an economist at the German Institute for Economic Research.\n\nThe composite PMI for Germany fell to 48.5 in September from 51.7 in August, pointing to an economic contraction. It was the lowest reading in almost seven years.\n\nServices activity also declined in the U.K., where providers face uncertainty about the timing and terms of the country\u2019s exit from the European Union, and the prospect of a general election.\n\n\u201cDeferred client orders and reduced consumer spending as a result of Brexit uncertainty and a slowing global economy meant hard-pressed businesses started to lose their battle against the hardest conditions for about a decade,\u201d said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply.\n\nA similar survey for Japan also released Thursday pointed to a less sharp slowdown in services activity, with the PMI for that sector falling to 52.8 from 53.3. Data for the U.S. will be released later Thursday, but a preliminary estimate pointed to a slight pickup from a low level.\n\nWrite to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "description": "Activity in the eurozone\u2019s services sector slowed more sharply than first estimated in September, according to surveys of purchasing managers, suggesting a manufacturing downturn is spreading to other parts of the economy.", "authors": ["Paul Hannon", "Paul.Hannon Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-113264/social"}
