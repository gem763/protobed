Predictably, the same cast of characters are either breathlessly exclaiming that the Trump administration is again at the precipice of an existential crisis, or refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of the inquiry or the seriousness of the actions of the president. All of the network news channels provide an endless loop of impeachment talk, ranging from reports of leaked testimony by witnesses before supposedly closed House committee hearings to supposedly impartial representatives and senators who are eager to proclaim on camera the guilt or innocence of the president before the evidence is even heard.\n\nMeanwhile, opponents of the president can hardly contain their giddiness at shifting polls which show roughly half of respondents now support his impeachment and removal. Having abandoned hope that the former special counsel would deliver a single fatal blow of collusion, the strategy against the president now appears to involve death from a thousand cuts. While presumably the best case for Democrats would be a quick impeachment and removal of Donald Trump, the next best is a steady drumbeat of bad news all the way through to the election next year. This way even if the evidence does not materialize, perhaps the aggregate effect of scandal fatigue will do the trick.\n\nThis means we should expect one more year of this. That is not a good thing. Every hour of every day that the Washington establishment is fixated on impeachment they are not addressing the issues affecting the daily lives of Americans. Immigration, inner city crime, homelessness, gun violence, deficit spending and the exploding national debt, climate change, health care costs, white nationalism, and student loan burdens are all effectively ignored while our political leaders are consumed by this fight. Partisan battle lines within Congress solidify, public anger is stoked, and what little chance exists of progress between the branches is minimized.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is not to say that Congress should neglect its legitimate oversight function. The need to address policy issues should not be used as an excuse to ignore Congress\u2019 obligation to serve as a check and balance to the executive. Nor is it fair to argue there is nothing to see here regarding President Trump Donald John TrumpGraham to introduce resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry Support for impeachment inches up in poll Fox News's Bret Baier calls Trump's attacks on media 'a problem' MORE\u2019s call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. After narrowly dodging a bullet with respect to the Russia probe, Trump handed his enemies a ripe issue to dig into. Elections have consequences, and the Democrat-controlled House has every right to investigate this matter and determine if it rises to the level of an impeachable offense.\n\nBut Congress and the media can decide whether to tone this down and proceed in a more deliberate and discrete manner, or to maintain the 24/7 fever pitch which unfortunately has become the new normal. While we do not know the details of what House investigators will uncover, we do know that Trump will fight tooth and nail to defend himself, Republicans in Congress will likely remain steadfast behind him, and Republican voters will most certainly remain unimpressed with it all. This means the current stalemate will drag on through the fall, the holidays, and through the 2020 election.\n\nAll sides have the opportunity to lower the temperature, conduct the oversight this situation requires, and resist it consuming all of Washington\u2019s focus for the next year. Congressional Democrats and Republicans will be judged by history and the American public on how they handle themselves during this critical time. President Trump will be judged based on what they find. But they should all look past short-term tactical advantages and think about how their actions affect those Americans on the sidelines whose lives continue regardless of what is happening in Washington. That is what really matters.\n\nJoseph Moreno is a former federal counterterrorism prosecutor with the Department of Justice, a former staff member with the FBI 9/11 Review Commission, and a United States Army combat veteran.
