The problem is, nobody can figure out where the hell that notion came from.\n\nSome have suggested the commander-in-chief \u2014 a man famously fond of fabrication \u2014 made it all up.\n\nFrom nearly the moment the news of Badgdadi\u2019s death was made public, Trump said he died \u201crunning into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming.\u201d And he didn\u2019t back off the claim when asked for more info at a press conference on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI don't want to talk about it, but he was screaming, crying and whimpering. And he was scared out of his mind,\u201d Trump told reporters when asked about the comments.\n\nOfficials have shied away from backing the president on that claim, mostly because they can\u2019t figure out where the president got the idea.\n\nFive senior unnamed Trump administration officials who watched Trump\u2019s address on Sunday said they had no idea where the president came up with the detail that the ISIS leader was crying, according to a report from The Daily Beast. The officials were reportedly messaging things like \u201cuh where is he getting that?\u201d\n\nREAD: Baghdadi is dead. That doesn\u2019t mean ISIS is.\n\nOn the record, officials have dodged talking about Trump\u2019s characterization of Baghdadi\u2019s final moments.\n\n\u201cI know the president had planned to talk down to the unit and unit members,\u201d General Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what the source of that was. I assume it was talking directly to unit and unit members.\u201d\n\nActing Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, meanwhile, said he didn\u2019t \u201chave those details.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible, but unlikely, that Trump spoke with troops who carried out the raid. Two senior officials told the Daily Beast it was possible Trump talked with the commandos who were on the ground, but that has rarely happened in past operations.\n\nAnd while Trump was able to watch an overhead livestream of the raid on Baghdadi, that video did not include audio or capture footage inside underground tunnels, according to a report from the New York Times.\n\nCNN reporter Daniel Dale pointed out that the president has a habit of inventing tears \u2014 Trump does have a whole spiel about big, strong men crying around him.\n\n\u201cRule of thumb: If a Trump story involves a man crying, the man likely did not cry,\u201d Dale tweeted. \u201cHe has repeatedly invented male tears \u2014 to make opponents sound \u2018weak,\u2019 to make supporters sound fawning.\u201d\n\nCover: President Donald Trump speaks in the Diplomatic Room of the White House in Washington, Sunday, Oct. 27, 2019.
