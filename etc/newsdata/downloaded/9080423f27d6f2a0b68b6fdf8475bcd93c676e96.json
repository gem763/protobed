An ordinary voter could easily conclude the Democrats want to spend every federal dollar in sight on green energy, with nothing left for roads, troops or airports.\n\nEvery major Democratic presidential candidate supports the concept of the Green New Deal, which is a socialist manifesto for remaking the energy, transportation and real-estate sectors by government diktat. One think tank estimated this plan would cost the average U.S. household at least $36,000 per year. Got that kind of spare change under the cushions?\n\nSome of the Democratic candidates break with the GND on specifics such as guaranteed jobs for everybody and \u201cfree\u201d health care, which don\u2019t have any actual connection with climate policy. Yet the opening bid for a Democratic climate plan is at least $1 trillion in new spending over a decade, with many of the leading candidates going much higher than that.\n\nBernie Sanders\u2019 plan would cost $16 trillion over a decade. Kamala Harris comes in second in the spending derby, with a $10 trillion plan. Looking modest, by comparison, are plans by Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker ($3 trillion each), Pete Buttigieg ($2 trillion), Joe Biden ($1.7 trillion) and Beto O\u2019Rourke ($1.5 trillion).\n\nThese plans all aim to eliminate carbon energy in the United States within a couple of decades, through measures ranging from a government takeover of the energy sector to new funding for breakthrough technology. The goal is appropriate, and the urgency is probably justified, given the destructive reality of rising seas, rougher weather and the other troubling consequences of global warming. But totally missing is any effort to harness the power of capitalism to address the problem, which is often the fastest way to force change, if incentives are structured correctly.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 heads are in the sand\n\nRepublicans once had pragmatic, effective ideas on climate policy, such as the \u201ccap and trade\u201d plan that helped end the scourge of acid rain. But the party has its head in the sand now, as the tide laps higher and higher. Some Republicans still believe junk science claiming global warming is a hoax. President Trump may be the Denier-in-Chief. His climate policy involves more burning of fossil fuels, not less. He thinks windmills cause cancer. When reporters asked him about climate change at an August summit meeting in Paris, he defended his record by citing all the environmental impact statements he\u2019s been forced to sign as a developer.\n\nPresidential hopeful and Vermont Sen.

A practical plan based on free-market incentives would involve a carbon tax along with some kind of cap-and-trade system that allows the large-scale trading of emission credits. More would be needed, including technological breakthroughs in energy storage, smart grids, hydrogen power and possibly carbon capture. Nuclear power should probably play a role.\n\nIf fostered in a capitalist model, new forms of energy could become large industries that employ millions, create new forms of national wealth and help arrest global warming. If the government is in charge, we\u2019ll have much slower progress, debacles such as Solyndra and trillions of new dollars for politicians to misspend and direct toward favored constituents.", "description": "There's no pragmatic alternative to Democratic climate plans that would cost trillions.", "authors": ["Rick Newman", "Senior Columnist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FRidSOyzKdHiirRtCLw0Gw--~B/aD0xNjUxO3c9MjQ3NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/31594210-cf4f-11e9-935e-63e16ca26114"}
