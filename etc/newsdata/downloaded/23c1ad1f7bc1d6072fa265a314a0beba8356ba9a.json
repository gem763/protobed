A top Defense Department official certified to congressional committees on May 23 that Ukraine had made sufficient progress on anti-corruption efforts to merit the security funds. The Pentagon announced the $250 million aid package June 18.\n\nThat\u2019s how it typically works. But, on Trump\u2019s orders, the White House informed the Pentagon on July 18 that Ukraine\u2019s aid was being frozen, and didn\u2019t release the funds until Sept. 11, weeks before the deadline.\n\nAD\n\nIf the Defense Department certified in May that Ukraine had made enough progress on corruption to merit the security assistance funds, what was left for the White House to investigate?\n\nThe Facts\n\nTrump didn\u2019t raise corruption concerns in his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to the rough readout released by the White House. He made two requests. First, Trump asked Zelensky to look into a conspiracy theory involving Ukraine, the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and a Democratic National Committee server. Second, Trump asked for an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden, a potential Democratic opponent in the 2020 election, and his son Hunter Biden, who had business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNo evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden has surfaced. The CrowdStrike conspiracy theory \u2014 as it goes, Ukrainians secretly hacked into the DNC\u2019s servers in 2016 and then framed Russia for the intrusion \u2014 has been roundly debunked. But Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, this year pushed to get Ukraine to investigate both the Biden and CrowdStrike claims.\n\nAn ongoing impeachment inquiry in the House is focused on whether Trump abused his office by making these requests of Zelensky, and whether Trump conditioned the security assistance funds, or a meeting Zelensky was seeking with the U.S. president, on the CrowdStrike or Biden probes. Trump has denied a quid pro quo. The top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, William B. Taylor, testified to the House impeachment inquiry committee Oct. 22 that Ukraine\u2019s security assistance was withheld \u201cfor domestic political reasons.\u201d\n\nRooting out corruption in Ukraine is a security issue for the United States and Western allies: anti-corruption reforms check Russian influence, and economic reforms facilitate more ties with Western nations. The $250 million aid package included funds for counter-artillery radar and secure communication equipment, tactical vehicles and ambulances, sniper rifles, grenade launchers and ammunition, and military training. The White House also froze a separate $141 million aid package through the State Department.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUkraine is the most corrupt country in Europe, ranked 130 out of 180 countries on Transparency International\u2019s 2017 Corruption Perceptions Index,\u201d USAID said in a report outlining its Ukraine strategy from 2019 to 2024. \u201cThe abuse of entrusted power for private gain is endemic in the kleptocratic misuse of public resources, which has eroded the GOU [government of Ukraine] resource base for self-reliance, threatens the democratic state, and increases Ukraine\u2019s vulnerability to external manipulation.\n\n\u201cIndeed, a 2015 corruption assessment found that tax avoidance is widespread, a symptom of viewing the state as incapable of using public funds for the benefit of society, and has bankrupted state budgets. This keeps state officials\u2019 salaries low, incentivizing civil servants to live off bribes; in response, citizens continue to pay bribes in order to get things done, and are reassured that they should seek to avoid paying taxes. The continued participation of most Ukrainians in such exchanges serves to paralyze reforms seeking to change the status quo.\u201d\n\nBut Trump didn\u2019t mention any of that in his call with Zelensky. He doesn\u2019t bring up Ukraine\u2019s well-documented corruption in his public remarks; he focuses on Biden and the CrowdStrike-DNC server tale.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey want to have more corruption in Ukraine,\u201d said Anders \u00c5slund, a Swedish economist at the Atlantic Council who is heavily involved in Eastern European market reforms. \u00c5slund said the claim that Trump held up Ukraine\u2019s security aid due to corruption concerns didn\u2019t make sense because Giuliani\u2019s pressure campaign ended up ousting the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, \u201cbecause she was fighting corruption.\u201d\n\nCongress has sent more than $1.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, but the $250 million package this year appears to be the first one delayed by the White House.\n\nFor each year since 2017, the National Defense Authorization Act has required \u201ca certification by the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, that the Government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions to make defense institutional reforms ... for purposes of decreasing corruption, increasing accountability, and sustaining improvements of combat capability enabled by assistance.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe law also says \u201cthe certification shall include an assessment of the substantial actions taken to make such defense institutional reforms and the areas in which additional action is needed.\u201d So, the Defense Department is required to review Ukraine\u2019s progress on corruption before security assistance funds are released each year and note where there\u2019s room for improvement.\n\nThe Defense Department\u2019s undersecretary for policy, John C. Rood, sent a letter May 23 to congressional committees certifying that \u201cthe Government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing corruption, increasing accountability, and sustaining improvements of combat capability enabled by U.S. assistance.\u201d\n\nRood said the Defense Department made this certification after \u201cpersistent U.S. engagement with Ukraine\u201d including high-level meetings. Rood listed these milestones:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Ukrainian Government adopted legislation to authorize the Ministry of Defense to conduct direct procurement from international manufacturers, including through the Foreign Military Sales program. Furthermore, to strengthen civilian control of the military, the ministry is making progress toward increasing civilian staff, as most prominently illustrated by the fact that the Minister of Defense is now a civilian. Minister Poltorak also initiated an ambitious program to reform the command and control system in line with Euro-Atlantic principles, which will improve the management of Ukraine\u2019s forces. Lastly, Ukraine committed in writing to defense industry reforms and requested a Senior Defense Industry Advisor to improve the ability of Ukraine\u2019s domestic industry to provide critical material to the Ukrainian armed forces and transform the state-owned enterprise.\n\nIn its report for 2018, USAID said its partnership with Ukraine yielded \u201cseveral notable achievements\u201d on the anti-corruption front, including \u201csystemic reforms that created three new [health] ministry agencies and initiated a new \u2018money follows the patient\u2019 health system finance model,\u201d and \u201ca new five-year, $85 million Energy Security Project that will enhance Ukraine\u2019s energy security by: (1) helping key government agencies and the energy regulator meet European Union requirements; (2) supporting unbundling transmission and distribution from generation and supply in both the gas and electricity sectors; and (3) establishing competitive energy markets in the electricity, natural gas, and district heating sectors; and (4) advancing renewables.\u201d\n\nUSAID\u2019s report says it trained Ukrainian judges on spotting corruption in 2018, fostered more decentralization and local government control, and \u201chelped automate many standard government processes, thus making corrupt practices more difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Government of Ukraine (GOU) has laid the foundations of a new system to fight corruption; it is working to reform comprehensively the police and law enforcement systems; and it is advancing constitutional reforms and decentralization, including by steadily incorporating a vibrant civil society into policymaking and reform processes,\u201d the U.S. government says on its foreign-aid website, ForeignAssistance.gov. \u201cU.S. assistance has played an indispensable role in supporting reform in these and other critical areas.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs required by the NDAA, Rood in his May 23 letter also listed areas in which Ukraine could improve. That list includes implementing a \u201cmodern human resources management system\u201d and better procedures \u201cto ensure technology security, proper accountability, and end-use controls for U.S.-provided equipment.\u201d\n\nWe asked the White House how its Ukraine review differed from the Defense Department\u2019s, but received no response.\n\n\u00c5slund said he doubted there was a formal review. A Democratic congressional aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told us: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen no evidence that there was a \u2018White House review\u2019 of corruption in Ukraine. ... State/DoD never identified any concerns in this case. In addition, we have seen no evidence that the White House seriously requested any kind of information on corruption in Ukraine as part of its hold on security assistance.\u201d The White House has not held up assistance funds for other countries as it did with Ukraine\u2019s, the aide said.\n\nAD\n\nOn June 18, the Defense Department announced the $250 million in Ukraine security assistance.\n\nOn July 18, a week before Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky, White House \u201cofficials at the Office of Management and Budget relayed Trump\u2019s order to the State Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting,\u201d The Washington Post reported. \u201cAdministration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an \u2018interagency process\u2019 but to give them no additional information \u2014 a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported that Trump \u201cissued his directive to Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who conveyed it through the budget office to the Pentagon and the State Department, which were told only that the administration was looking at whether the spending was necessary.\u201d\n\nMulvaney also said the White House held up the security assistance funds while it reviewed how much other European countries contribute to Ukraine. Such figures are public and readily available. We ran them down while reporting this fact check:\n\nEurope has been a major funder to Ukraine since Russia annexed its Crimean Peninsula in 2014, often providing more aid than the United States. The European Union has provided more than 15 billion euros ($16.5 billion) in grants and loans to Ukraine, according to an E.U. fact sheet on relations with Ukraine. Meanwhile, NATO has its own military cooperation program with Ukraine, establishing six trust funds to assist the country in improving its military readiness. The United States provided $1.3 billion to Ukraine since late 2013, according to a 2017 Congressional Research Service report. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the top 10 donors in gross overseas development assistance for Ukraine in 2016-2017 are: European Institutions ($425.2 million), United States ($204.4 million), Germany ($189.8 million), Japan ($180.8 million), Global Fund to fight diseases ($44.8 million), Canada ($44.5 million), Poland ($42.5 million), Sweden ($34.6 million), Britain ($31.6 million) and Switzerland ($29.6 million). Trump would be on more solid ground if he had kept his complaint strictly to military aid. \u201cThe United States is the largest provider of military aid to Ukraine,\u201d said John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine now at the Atlantic Council.\n\nOn \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Mulvaney said: \u201cOnce we were able to satisfy ourselves that corruption was actually \u2014 they were doing better with it, we got that information from our folks from the conversation with Minister [President] Zelensky and once we were able to establish we had the Office of Management and Budget do research on other countries\u2019 aid to Ukraine, it turns out they don\u2019t get any lethal aid, but they do give a considerable sum of money and nonlethal aid. Once those two things were cleared, the money flowed. There was never any connection between the flow of money and the server.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nThere\u2019s simply nothing that shows the White House conducted a review of corruption in Ukraine while it withheld the $250 million in aid through the Defense Department or the $141 million in aid through the State Department. How was the review done? What did it find? How was it different from the Pentagon\u2019s legally mandated review? Mulvaney\u2019s bare-bones description on Fox News cited \u201cinformation from our folks\u201d and Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky, in which corruption was not discussed but Biden and CrowdStrike were.\n\nThe most recent detailed accounts from U.S. government officials say Ukraine is making progress in stemming corruption, including a certification from a top Defense Department official in May and a report from USAID covering 2018.\n\nThey show that Trump and Mulvaney\u2019s stated rationale for withholding the $250 million in security aid from Ukraine flies against the facts. The White House isn\u2019t rebutting the Defense Department\u2019s finding that Ukraine made sufficient progress on corruption to merit the security funds. It hasn\u2019t offered a counterargument to the U.S. agencies and officials detailing Ukraine\u2019s progress on corruption. As far as we can tell, Trump\u2019s concern is limited to Biden and the DNC server.\n\nSo, without any evidence in support, and much evidence to the contrary, we give Trump and Mulvaney\u2019s claim Four Pinocchios.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter", "description": "Defense Department and USAID documents show that President Trump and Mick Mulvaney\u2019s stated rationale for withholding security aid from Ukraine doesn\u2019t add up.", "authors": ["Salvador Rizzo", "Reporter For The Fact Checker"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/S5Lfk8xJEdF79pAg8RBVQPmwVh4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WHAT6SXREYI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
