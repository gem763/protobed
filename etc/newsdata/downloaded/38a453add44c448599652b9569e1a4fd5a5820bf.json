But when it came out in 1969 the record industry did not know what to do with it, despite reviews in the music press saluting a creative masterpiece.\n\nThis autumn the Kinks\u2019 lyrical story of an ordinary man caught up in a time of great national change has been turned into a BBC Radio 4 show, broadcast next month. For Sir Ray Davies, the band\u2019s revered frontman, the radio revival and a 50-year anniversary re-release of the album this week could not have come at a more fitting moment.\n\n\u201cIt has found its voice. By sheer coincidence, it resonates more now that it did then,\u201d he told the Observer. The struggles and uncertainty of the postwar era are matched, he believes, by the current search for what it means to be English or British.\n\n\u201cToday, I feel we have got a similar atmosphere. To be fairly critical, looking back at the 60s, I think we blew it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was a generation that made great art, but the politics and the country was falling apart.\u201d\n\nDavies, 75, describes the album as a \u201cpop documentary\u201d rather than a \u201cpop opera\u201d. Featuring his well-known songs Shangri-la and Victoria, it tells of a working-class family split in two when the father figure, Arthur, decides to move to Australia to make a better life.\n\n\u201cI brought in all these characters I knew and used the break-up of family as a metaphor for the break-up of empire,\u201d Davies explained.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ray Davies in 2016.

Another generation up,\u201d said Davies. \u201cBut anyway there was a falling out between the producer and the director and Granada TV. Words were said to the effect of \u2018If I don\u2019t get what I want I\u2019m walking.\u2019 And they said, \u2018Go ahead.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe playwright Julian Mitchell had written a script, inspired by the life of Davies\u2019s brother-in-law, and Davies wrote 12 accompanying songs.\n\n\u201cAs an album it is a signpost of where the Kinks were going,\u201d said Davies. \u201cWe stopped being a pop band with the album The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society the year before, which was a homage to my spiritual or fantasy world. Then, with Arthur, I turned back to reality. I wanted to write about England, damn it. And so I stood my ground after Village Green failed commercially, if not artistically. I was quite stubborn and I\u2019m still quite stubborn.\u201d\n\nThe tracks were not all designed for release as singles and some space for longer guitar solos was \u201cnegotiated\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really win any battles with the record company. You never do. They say they\u2019ll do something, then they bend your arm and do what they want. So I just thought I would make the record I want to make,\u201d said Davies.\n\nThe hour-long radio version, together with a longer stage show, has been adapted in collaboration with the playwright and musician Paul Sirett, with whom Davies wrote the show Come Dancing.\n\nThe cast includes Lee Ross as Arthur, Davies\u2019s real-life brother-in-law, and Rosie Cavaliero as his beloved elder sister, Rose, and there are key songs from the original album, along with other Kinks\u2019 hits Waterloo Sunset and You Really Got Me. It is also likely to come to the stage as a musical in the new year.\n\n\u201cIt is a play set 50 years ago that is about now,\u201d said Sirett, adding: \u201cRay is a very important English voice. He can still tell us things we haven\u2019t even spotted about ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe Davies brothers were born into a large, close-knit family in north London and suffered poverty and bereavement before they achieved fame. Their eldest sister, Rene, a dance hall star, had died suddenly when Ray was 13.\n\n\u201cIt is a more emotional album for me than Village Green, as it is based on my own family,\u201d said Davies. \u201cArthur and Rose were a surrogate father and mother to me. Arthur didn\u2019t know the word \u2018mentor\u2019 and didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what he was. He was disciplined after his time in the army and it was character-building for me. He thought I was an annoying little bastard but we really missed them. Yet if Arthur had not left for Australia, my brother and I might not have formed the band. He wanted me to get a job and I would have stayed at art school for longer.\u201d\n\nThe remastered re-release of the original album includes extra tracks that show the genesis of the key musical themes. It also features the solo music that Dave Davies, the band\u2019s lead guitarist, was making at the same time.\n\n\u201cI wanted to put out a balanced overview,\u201d said Ray Davies. The brothers notoriously fought throughout the latter part of their careers, but things are on the mend. The inclusion of his brother\u2019s tracks from a solo album that was never released is a sign they are now, as Davies has admitted, if not exactly back together again, then at least \u201cback to our dysfunction\u201d.\n\nThe Kinks\u2019 musical mood has been called nostalgic, but Davies isn\u2019t keen on the word. He prefers \u201cremembrance\u201d or \u201cmelancholy\u201d and also points out his hits All Day and All of the Night and You Really Got Me hardly fit this bill. He does concede though that the sadnesses of his youth \u201cmay have had an effect\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was traumatised by Rene\u2019s death,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was a kid if you had an issue you kept quiet about it. There was shame. So I didn\u2019t sit down and say I am going to write a melancholy theme. I was sensitive and couldn\u2019t express myself. Then I found music and the outpouring began. I\u2019ll never stop writing because I think of tunes incessantly \u2013 it bugs me. They come into my head \u2013 literally voices in my head.\u201d\n\nWhen the Kinks toured Australia in 1971, Davies met up again backstage with his brother-in-law Arthur. \u201cHe told me he liked my work and that he knew I had written about him,\u201d said Davies. \u201cThe overall impression I got was that the trip out to Australia was a success, although Rose didn\u2019t want to go.\u201d", "description": "As \u2018pop documentary\u2019 Arthur is reissued and turned into a radio drama, the singer explains why it is more relevant than ever", "authors": ["Vanessa Thorpe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc5fac5c3fd02d2e2f82592ae12676d70d6ce0ea/0_213_5017_3010/master/5017.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=72bd213a757d4931d2f1905c957ceb88", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
