His death garnered national attention and sparked a wave of protests against racial bias and police use of excessive force.\n\nThe case came to a close with an emotional two-day sentencing hearing that included testimony from both the Guyger and Jean families. The jury deliberated for less than 90 minutes before determining Guyger\u2019s sentence, which begins immediately. She\u2019ll be eligible for parole in five years.\n\nJean\u2019s little brother, Brandt, gave a gut-wrenching victim statement after the sentencing, telling Guyger he forgives her and \u201cwants the best\u201d for her. He then got Judge Tammy Kemp\u2019s permission to give her a hug.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want you to go to jail. I want the best for you, because I know that\u2019s exactly what Botham would want,\u201d the 18-year-old said in court.\n\nAt one point, Kemp also gave hugs to Jean\u2019s relatives and Guyger\u2014offering both parties words of encouragement.\n\nDozens of people expressed outrage over the sentence outside of the courtroom, with some shouting \u201cjustice was not served.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy give her a murder conviction and then only give her 10 years? That\u2019s a slap in the face,\u201d one protester said.\n\nDuring the hearing, the former cop\u2019s mother, Karen Guyger, stunned the courtroom when she told the jury her daughter had been sexually assaulted when she was six, reiterating the defense\u2019s argument that Guyger had experienced adversity as a child that prompted her to become a police officer.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to take his place. She always would tell me she wishes she could\u2019ve taken his place. She feels very bad about it,\u201d she said through tears while holding a crumpled tissue.\n\nThe Jean family reportedly arrived at court early on Wednesday, bringing two small bottles of sparkling cider and a crate full of snacks, including water bottles with Jean\u2019s face printed on them alongside the words, \u201cJesus Loves You. Celebrating the Life of Botham Jean.\u201d\n\nThe hearing opened Tuesday with a tearful testimony from Jean\u2019s mother, Allison, who raised her hands in elation when the verdict was read.\n\n\u201cMy life has not been the same. It\u2019s just been like a roller coaster,\u201d Allison Jean said while wearing her middle son\u2019s favorite color, red. \u201cI cannot sleep. I cannot eat. It\u2019s just been the most terrible time for me.\u201d\n\nJean, an accountant at PricewaterhouseCoopers, was sitting on his couch eating vanilla ice cream around 10 p.m. when the five-year police veteran entered his apartment, believing it was her own. Guyger took the stand in her own defense on Friday, claiming she truly believed someone was inside her home when she arrived after a 13-hour shift.\n\nShe testified that she believed she was acting out of self-defense when she shot at him twice.\n\n\u201cI thought that he was coming at me. I was scared he was gonna kill me,\u201d she said, admitting she was shooting to kill when she pulled the trigger. Her lawyers called the incident a tragic misunderstanding after the \u201cexhausted\u201d off-duty cop\u2019s long shift.\n\nBut prosecutors said it was \u201cunreasonable\u201d for Guyger to confuse his unit with her own, and grilled her for calling 911 instead of giving Jean proper medical aid, prosecutors alleged.\n\n\u201cHow could that happen to our son, how could we lose Botham? Such a sweet boy,\u201d Botham\u2019s father, Bertram Jean, told the jury on Wednesday through tears. \u201cHe tried his best to live a good, honest life. I\u2019ll never see him again and I still want to see him.\u201d\n\nDallas County prosecutors argued throughout the week-long trial Guyger was \u201cdistracted\u201d by her affair with her married partner and missed all the signs that should\u2019ve led her to realize she wasn\u2019t in her own apartment. Guyger also testified she texted her married police partner right after the fatal shooting: \u201cHurry, I need you. I fucked up.\u201d\n\nAllisa Findley, Jean\u2019s sister, told jurors Tuesday her brother\u2019s death has had a ripple effect on their entire family, causing her once \u201cbubbly\u201d younger brother to live in fear of the police and become a \u201cshell of himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want my brother back,\u201d she said of Botham. After the sentencing was read, Findley held her head in her hands crying while family members tried to console her.\n\nIn addition to victim testimony, prosecutors showed jurors Guyger\u2019s text messages, saying they show her lack of sensitivity toward black people. In one January 2018 exchange while the former cop was working security during the Dallas Martin Luther King Jr. Day Parade, she groaned the event could take up to three hours and suggested pepper spraying participants to get them to leave.\n\nJurors were also shown texts between Guyger and her married partner, Officer Martin Rivera.\n\n\u201cDamn I was at this area with 5 different black officers !!! Not racist but damn,\u201d Rivera texted Guyger in March 2018, to which she quickly responded: \u201cNot racist but just have a different way of working and it shows.\u201d", "description": "Amber Guyger was convicted Tuesday of murdering her black neighbor, Botham Jean, after mistaking his Dallas apartment for her own.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570032957/amber_guyger_zi1csy"}
