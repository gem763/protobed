No one else was going to.", "language": "en", "text": "Columnist\n\nThe NFL player who puts his self-interest first is always labeled a little crazy. Why is that? Whenever a man bucks the ideology of team fealty, he\u2019s painted as an unpredictable danger and a threat to the entire city\u2019s infrastructure. Antonio Brown was the most reliably great wide receiver in the league for six years, but suddenly, because he exercised some canny self-determination and busted himself out of a lousy situation, everyone wants to know if this selfish lunatic can sublimate his ungovernable personality. That, or they think he somehow played them.\n\nIt\u2019s never the degenerate league owner, or the coach whose hoarse voice holds the rattling of a thousand bourbon-soaked ice cubes, who is supposed to show some loyalty and discretion. It\u2019s only the player. In this case, Brown wrested his fate into his own hands, outwitted all of those who would have shackled him to bad organizations and outmaneuvered all of the NFL rules that are about hobbling player movement in the marketplace by treating players like third-graders in need of a hall pass, to land with the New England Patriots. Good for him.\n\nBrown is 31, with only a couple of contracts left in him, and he was tired of dealing with a punch-drunk balloon-head of a quarterback in Ben Roethlisberger on a downward-trending team in Pittsburgh. When the Steelers shipped him to a sinkhole in Oakland, he got a load of the chaotic sham-ism and dumpster igniting that Coach Jon Gruden and General Manager Mike Mayock call leadership, and he decided he couldn\u2019t choke it down even for $30 million.\n\n[Jerry Brewer: It\u2019s Antonio Brown\u2019s NFL now, and everyone else is just living in it]\n\nSo he turned himself into the very picture of a malcontent, broke every rule of training camp truancy and violated all of the respect-for-authority norms in a league that is literally terrified of loose-change individualists until he was free and could take his pick of teams. Again, good for him. May he win a Super Bowl ring with New England and get his $20 million extension.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether Brown is a complicated man \u2014 \u201cthis attention-craving drama queen\u201d in the words of ESPN\u2019s Dan Orlovsky \u2014 or just a supremely calculating one. Either way, I root for him and hope he wins in the bigger context, which is to own himself and not let this disloyal profession turn him into another disposable piece of hamburger in a fast-food wrapper.\n\nPerhaps not since Deion Sanders has a player judo-flipped the league so effectively to gain career leverage. It\u2019s instructive to look back at Sanders\u2019s NFL experience and the way he parlayed his baseball talent and instinct for marketing himself as \u201cPrime Time\u201d into a series of big paydays for good teams, managing to win two Super Bowl rings with the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers. Sanders always understood something crucial, if painful, about NFL celebrity: A hundred thousand people can scream for you, but they don\u2019t even \u201cknow your middle name,\u201d he observed once.\n\n[The Patriots looked unbeatable against the Steelers. And now they add Antonio Brown.]\n\nSanders played the best season of his career in 1994 for the 49ers, was the defensive player of the year, made all-pro and helped them win the Super Bowl. And then they didn\u2019t even make him a worthwhile offer. Which taught him, as he wrote last year in an interesting letter to his younger self for the Players\u2019 Tribune, something crucial.\n\n\u201cYou play this game because you love it. But these teams and these owners and these fans? They don\u2019t love you. They say they do, but they don\u2019t. They love what you do. And when you cease to do what you do, their love for you will cease, as well.\u201d\n\nThe moral of that story is: Never love the institution, because it won\u2019t love you back, not in the end.\n\n\u201cThe game can provide for you,\u201d Sanders points out. \u201cIt can sustain you financially. It can give a lifestyle that you\u2019ve always dreamed of having. But it can\u2019t possibly love you.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, the Patriots under Coach Bill Belichick make no pretenses about love. It\u2019s a highly transactional franchise. Whatever Belichick demands of his players, he doesn\u2019t do it under the pretext that they owe him some measure of personal devotion. What they owe is dedication to craft, supreme professionalism. The demands are based simply on a recognition that winning is in everyone\u2019s self-interest, and everyone will get paid. If affection develops, too, well, great.\n\n[Ben Roethlisberger brushes off Antonio Brown questions with a curt, \u2018Whatever\u2019]\n\nIf you think about it, you don\u2019t hear much about the Patriots fining players. They don\u2019t pick needless fights with their guys or challenge their pride just to establish the authority chain. If someone isn\u2019t with the program and makes mistakes that waste their teammates\u2019 efforts, they\u2019re simply gone. You don\u2019t hear Belichick saying something as silly as Mayock\u2019s chesty demand to Brown, \u201cIt\u2019s time for him to be all-in or all-out.\u201d\n\nThat was a profound insult to a grown man whose entire career has been about league-leading performances, who has been a four-time all-pro and who never once has cheated when it came to on-field effort.\n\nThe prediction here is that Brown will be just fine with the Patriots. The idea that it\u2019s a team made up of automatons is silly: Tom Brady and Julian Edelman maintain two of the more entertaining, and at times revealing, Instagram accounts in the league. The franchise, which is known for player evaluation, has had its share of nonconformists and must have every expectation that Brown can dial back his temperament and need for attention. Yeah, so he batted over a water cooler in Pittsburgh. You\u2019ve never seen Brady scream at a teammate or coach and hurl his helmet?\n\nThe narrative that Brown is too much the diva and lacks the self-control to be a Patriot is nonsense.
