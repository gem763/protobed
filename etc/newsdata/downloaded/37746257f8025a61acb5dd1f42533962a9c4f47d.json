To be fair to the liberals, they do have much to fear.\n\nThe entire edifice the left has built in the United States and abroad is based on a foundation of laws and policies that depart from defensible ideas about the natural rights of humans. Instead, we have been promoting compulsions that trample these rights.\n\nAmerica decided at its very beginning that the individual has unalienable rights to free speech, freedom of conscience, self-defense, private property (which is the physical manifestation of our labor), and so on.\n\nGood governments secure these universal rights, while bad governments abridge them.\n\nOur founding documents say that these are God-given rights, a statement that nobody from Aquinas to John Locke to Thomas Jefferson (who wrote those words into the Declaration of Independence) would have found controversial. One does not need to have faith, however, to understand that these are universal axioms that precede the creation of government.\n\nWe can observe in our own human nature, for example, what Leo Strauss\u2014one of the 20th century\u2019s leading proponents of the theory of natural rights\u2014called \u201cthe equality of all men in regard to the right of self-preservation.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t need government\u2014or the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), for that matter\u2014to tell us that each of us would fight to prevent our murder. The right to liberty and property are really extensions of our survival instinct.\n\nThere is a debate within conservative circles at the moment as to whether rights regarding freedom from government interference are truly universal or, just like rights regarding freedom from want, they are the product of tradition and cultural values.\n\nStrauss has Aquinas clarifying the matter this way: \u201cthe axioms from which the more specific rules of natural right are derived are universally valid and immutable; what are mutable only are the more specific rules.\u201d\n\nIn other words, cultural habits tend to produce governments that put a premium on the defense of universal natural rights, and others that do not.\n\nThe United States and other freedom-loving nations have the responsibility to criticize those governments that quash the universal rights to religious conscience, to life, to property, etc.\n\nThese nations also have an obligation to stay out of each other\u2019s internal debates over the size of the welfare state, for example. Ditto for such issues as abortion, same-sex marriage, or identity group rights, about which we ourselves continue to have a robust debate.\n\nThe promotion of these cultural values would undermine real universal rights. As The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Emilie Kao and Grace Melton write, in a warning about United Nations mischief-making, \u201ccreating new rights based on membership in special identity groups corrodes principles of equality and universality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe freedom to live according to one\u2019s conscience is integral to the flourishing of all human rights,\u201d Kao and Melton add, yet Europe and the U.S. provide \u201cnumerous cases\u201d of \u201cnon-discrimination laws being used to force individuals to endorse a new sexual orthodoxy by supporting same-sex relations or same-sex marriage, under threat of economic punishment.\u201d\n\nProgressives may have a problem with these issues being considered at the State Department; no one else should.", "description": "\u201cEvery human law has just so much of the nature of law as is derived from the law of nature,\u201d Thomas Aquinas\u00a0wrote. \u201cBut if at any point it deflects from the law of nature, it is no longer a law but a perversion of the law.\u201d\n\nAquinas\u2019s observation that human law either ratifies natural law or perverts it is a good North Star in promoting human rights around the world.", "authors": ["Mike Gonzalez", "Senior Fellow", "Center For Foreign Policy", "Mike Gonzalez Is A Senior Fellow At The Douglas", "Sarah Allison Center For Foreign Policy At The Heritage Foundation."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-06/GettyImages-117019464.jpg?itok=Q0BFJxG3"}
