The Ninja Foodi is on sale today for $120, which is a sweet savings of $130 from the list price of $250 (that\u2019s 52% off for those who like the details). It crisps! It air fries! It tender-crisps! It\u2019s awesome, mostly because of the time savings. In about 20 minutes, you can thaw and cook meat at the same time, then close the crisping lid to finish things off. To say that in a different way: The Ninja is a pressure cooker that seals in liquids in minutes, plus it\u2019s also a crisper that adds an extra layer of, well, crispness.\n\nA nice bonus is that you can cook multiple side dishes at the same time as the meat, all in one pot -- so veggies, potatoes, multiple types of meat. It\u2019s also an air fryer, so you can drop in some fries and go full-on McDonald\u2019s if you want. The Ninja Foodi has five temperature settings, a non-stick ceramic coating, has a 6.5-quart capacity, and cooks at 1400 watts. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
