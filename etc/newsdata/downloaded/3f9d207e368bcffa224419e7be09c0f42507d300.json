It embodies the Nissan Intelligent Mobility vision of personal transportation \u2013 one where electrification and vehicle intelligence will offer seamless and adaptive travel experiences free of accidents or harmful emissions.\n\nThe Ariya Concept expands on design elements first hinted at by the Nissan IMx concept at the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show. They include the bold electrified V-motion signature \u201cshield\u201d and striking rear light blade, short overhangs, and an interior that feels more like a lounge than a conventional vehicle.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s a concept vehicle, the crossover EV\u2019s bold styling and unconventional interior and exterior elements could make it into production in the near future.\n\n\u201cThe Ariya Concept represents a strong collaboration between design and engineering,\u201d said Yasuhiro Yamauchi, representative executive officer, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. \u201cIt is the next stage of Nissan\u2019s future design language as we embark on a new era for the company \u2013 the next stage in our evolution.\u201d\n\nThe Ariya Concept shares the stage at the Tokyo Motor Show with the Nissan IMk, an EV urban commuter concept revealed earlier this month. The two vehicles serve as \u201cbookends\u201d for Nissan\u2019s new vision of an electrified brand identity.\n\nNissan Intelligent Mobility \u2013 a new design language\n\nThe Ariya Concept represents an entirely new design direction for Nissan.\n\n\u201cA new vehicle architecture means fresh opportunities to redefine how vehicles interact with society, how an EV paired with advanced driving capabilities can offer a new perspective,\u201d said Alfonso Albaisa, Nissan\u2019s senior vice president of global design. \u201cWith this vehicle and the IMk concept, we wanted to ensure that the soul of every Nissan car possess a distinctive Japanese DNA conveyed in a simple-yet-powerfully modern way, something we call \u2018Timeless Japanese Futurism.\u2019\u201d\n\nCharacterized by the concepts \u201csleek,\u201d \u201cseamless\u201d and \u201csexy,\u201d the Nissan Ariya Concept features examples of this new design language throughout the exterior, including wide front fenders, super-thin LED headlights, as well as the front shield (typically a grille on a gasoline-powered vehicle) which is emblazoned with a bespoke, illuminated Nissan emblem. The shield incorporates a subtle geometric pattern that reveals itself when the electrified V-motion signature is illuminated.\n\n\u201cWe replaced the conventional grille with what we call a \u2018shield\u2019 \u2013 an expressive piece with innovative 3-D texture within that goes beyond cosmetics, but also as a way to highlight the technology lurking within the vehicle,\u201d said Albaisa. \u201cIn this case, it\u2019s a radar sensor and other technologies that help the Ariya Concept read the road and visualize things the driver can\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the vehicle\u2019s profile are five-blade, 21-inch aluminum wheels with custom tires. A low, sleek roofline allows the vehicle to slice through the air. The styling of the Ariya Concept\u2019s rear is also a departure from traditional SUVs, with a steeply raked C-pillar that blends seamlessly into a muscular rear deck. A one-piece light blade with blacked-out lenses runs across the width of the body. Rear fender flares and a high-mounted rear wing offer not-so-subtle suggestions of the vehicle\u2019s power.\n\n\u201cThe exterior strikes a balance between dynamic beauty and \u2018tech sharpness,\u2019 with proportions that show what\u2019s possible with Nissan\u2019s 100% electric vehicle platform,\u201d Albaisa said. \u201cThe surprisingly short overhangs, large cabin, large wheels and tailored two-tone paint scheme provide an elegant appearance that balances sport and luxury.\u201d\n\nThe Ariya Concept\u2019s Suisei Blue paint scheme creates a dual appearance, depending on the distance viewed. From afar, the deep blue color takes on a matte-like finish. Upon closer inspection, large embedded glass flakes produce billions of light refractions, reminiscent of a comet crossing the night sky.\n\nAccenting the Ariya Concept\u2019s roofline and wheels is a new signature color for future Nissan EVs: copper, the color of the sun as it breaks through the night to start a new day. It symbolizes the dawn of a new automotive era while also giving a nod to traditional Japanese artisans who formed copper into works of functional art.\n\nWhile the Ariya Concept\u2019s exterior mainly expresses the ideas of \u201csleek\u201d and \u201csexy,\u201d the interior reflects a notion of seamlessness \u2013 represented by the integration of technology with daily life and the precise nature of Japanese craftsmanship.\n\n\u201cWith a flat floor \u2013 made possible by the battery pack layout and absence of an internal combustion engine\u2013 the Ariya Concept welcomes occupants as they step in the cabin with a feeling of expansion and openness,\u201d said Albaisa. \u201cPanels blend naturally into each other and flow seamlessly from the front, sides and rear, giving a panoramic impression from any seat position.\u201d\n\nThe minimalist dashboard is uncluttered by the buttons and switches found in conventional vehicles. When the Ariya Concept is energized, seamlessly integrated haptic touch controls along the instrument panel come to life with a glow. When the car is not in use, they disappear into the surface. The only physical controls are the start button, a single knob to operate the 12.3-inch display monitor, and the climate controls, which are artfully ingrained into the instrument panel\u2019s genuine-wood lower section. The instrument panel transitions flawlessly into the doors and interior elements, to be out of sight when not in use.\n\nThe Ariya Concept\u2019s supportive, comfortable seats feature a super-thin frame, providing even more free interior space and enhanced visibility. The front and rear seats are positioned to ensure that everyone has a great view of the surroundings and offer a sensation reminiscent of floating on a magic carpet. To make long drives more comfortable, the seat back and seat bottoms feature perforated leather upholstery, with material concentration where the occupant\u2019s lower back and hip touch. A brilliant copper fabric under the perforation adds beauty and depth.\n\nThroughout the cabin, interior materials were carefully selected to give an impression of solidness, technology and utility. Fine black synthetic leather covers the instrument panel and inner door panels. A different grade of synthetic leather with a textured grain lines the A-pillar and ceiling. This provides a subtle yet effective visual contrast. Satin copper-colored aluminum accents, incorporated into the instrument panel, seats and steering wheel, exude a sense of unity with the exterior color.\n\nAn icon of Nissan Intelligent Mobility\n\nNissan designed the Ariya Concept to fully embody the three pillars of Nissan Intelligent Mobility \u2013 Intelligent Driving, Intelligent Power and Intelligent Integration. Combining advanced electric-vehicle technology with a new level of seamless human-machine interface connectivity, it offers an entirely new driving experience.\n\nThe Ariya Concept features the latest version of Nissan\u2019s award-winning driver assistance system, ProPILOT 2.0, for a more confident and comfortable drive. The system combines navigated highway driving with hands-off single-lane driving capabilities. By engaging the vehicle's navigation system to help maneuver the car on a predefined route on designated roads, the system can assist the driver with passing, lane diversions and lane exiting on multi-lane highways.\n\nProPILOT 2.0 also enables hands-off driving while cruising in a given lane.i,ii When approaching a road diversion or preparing to pass another vehicle, the system judges the appropriate timing of branching off or passing based on information from the navigation system and 360-degree sensing. The driver receives intuitive audio and visual guidance and is prompted to put both hands on the steering wheel and confirm the start of these operations via a switch. When driving with ProPILOT 2.0 engaged, the interior lighting changes colors to signal that hands-off driving is enabled, while creating a relaxing atmosphere.\n\nBuilt with a high-performance, 100% electric drive system, the Nissan Ariya Concept delivers instant torque to the wheels from a dual front/rear motor drive configuration. This layout delivers balanced, predictable power to all four wheels, equal or better than many premium sports cars.\n\nThe Ariya Concept promises excellent cornering performance and traction on slippery surfaces such as snow and loose dirt, without drivers needing to change their driving style, steering input or even pedal position. It accomplishes this thanks to the high-power, twin-motor, all-wheel control system. Employing knowledge gained from years of vehicle control development \u2013 including the Nissan GT-R\u2019s ATTESA E-TS torque split system and the Nissan Patrol\u2019s intelligent 4X4 system \u2013 engineers created this new system to manage the EV\u2019s power delivery and brakes automatically, ensuring smooth passage with minimal tire slippage. Drivers can maintain their driving posture and comfort, letting the system do all the work.\n\nSeamless integration\n\nIntuitive technology allows the Ariya Concept to fit seamlessly into the driver\u2019s daily life, on-board and off-board, providing the freedom and enjoyment of mobility anytime and anywhere.\n\nTraveling assistance isn\u2019t limited to the vehicle. Among the human-machine interface features is Door to Door Navigation, which allows anyone to set a destination on their smartphone, transfer it to the Ariya Concept and have the vehicle\u2019s navigation system continue offering directions. If the final destination is reached by foot, the system will transfer the remaining route back to the driver\u2019s smartphone.\n\nWhen approaching the Ariya Concept, the driver is greeted with a welcome light as the vehicle unlocks automatically, eliminating the need to fumble with a key fob. Even before getting inside, settings such as the driver\u2019s seat position and climate controls are adjusted to the driver\u2019s personal preferences, which the driver can save to a smartphone as a unique profile. The car can sync with the driver\u2019s schedule to anticipate departure times and prepare the vehicle to be climate-controlled and ready to hit the road \u2013 maximizing driving range by using grid power to heat or cool the car.\n\nOnce the driver is inside, the Virtual Personal Assistant can help look up information and locate parking, so that the driver can keep their eyes on the road.\n\nWhile traveling, the Nissan Ariya Concept\u2019s Smart Route Planner automatically identifies and plots charging stops along the way, ensuring that the driver arrives at the desired destination, whether near or far.\n\nExcellent power storage management allows for long-distance driving, without lengthy charging times interrupting travel plans. When it\u2019s time to charge, the Ariya Concept uses CHAdeMO quick charging to energize the battery swiftly and conveniently. The charging port unlocks upon the driver\u2019s approach and uses distinct colors to show the vehicle\u2019s charge status at a glance.\n\nIf the plan includes picking up friends along the way, an integrated video chat feature can help confirm details before setting off. It can also link with their smartphones and the Ariya Concept\u2019s center information display to show their exact location.\n\nUpon arrival at their destination, drivers can use a smartphone or dedicated device to park the car automatically from a nearby location, thanks to ProPILOT Remote Park. This can be of help to passengers who need additional space or assistance to exit the car.\n\nFirmware Over The Air (FOTA) technology provides constant, hassle-free updates for the navigation system, graphic user interface and driving characteristics to ensure the car is running effectively and has the latest versions and features, keeping the driver\u2019s experience fresh and enjoyable.\n\nWhen parked at the office or home, the Ariya Concept supports Nissan Energy technology. The technology makes it possible to connect with energy systems to charge the EV battery, power homes and businesses, and even selling energy back to the power grid. Nissan Energy helps drivers fully harness the Ariya Concept\u2019s capabilities by expanding its use from just driving to include every aspect of life.\n\nAriya Concept \u2013 the new world of Nissan EVs\n\n\u201cNissan has a clear vision of global mobility. The Ariya Concept is just the beginning, as Nissan considers how design, packaging and driver enjoyment can be transformed through the architecture of new EV platforms,\u201d said Yamauchi. \u201cThe Ariya Concept is not a concept car designed from far off ideas, but rather a car that embodies Nissan Intelligent Mobility at its core and highlights a promise of an entirely new driving experience on the horizon.\u201d\n\nNissan Ariya Concept Dimensions Length 4600 mm Width (excluding door mirrors) 1920 mm Height 1630 mm\n\nAbout Nissan Canada Inc.\n\nNissan Canada Inc.
