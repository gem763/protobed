We're talking about a country to which we owe a debt because their efforts in the battlefield allowed us to defeat the Islamic State.\n\n\"We want there to be very stringent sanctions and we would like to see an EU initiative, which would lay down the basics of a stop to that intervention.\"", "description": "Turkey's military incursion into northern Syria is \"an act of war\", says EU Parliament President David Sassoli, who said the EU must do what is necessary to bring the operation to an end.", "authors": ["Rachael Kennedy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/06/16/1000x563_cmsv2_0a84a783-27b5-5a21-b0f8-000bb3181007-4240616.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
