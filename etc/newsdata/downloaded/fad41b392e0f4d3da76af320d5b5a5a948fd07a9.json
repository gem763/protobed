Hell, no", "language": "en", "text": "The video for the pop star\u2019s new single has outraged many Christians. But it\u2019s no sin to sing about the climate crisis\n\nAnd the Bible said: \u201cGod did not spare the angels when they sinned\u201d (2 Peter 2:9). Nor, it seems, did God spare Billie Eilish.\n\nThe 17-year-old pop star\u2019s unsettling new video finds her a fallen angel, ejected from Heaven and landing on Earth to find it a deserted, fiery hellscape. \u201cPeter\u2019s on vacation, an open invitation,\u201d she sings, against jaunty keys, suggesting that \u201ceven God herself \u2026 will want the Devil on her team\u201d.\n\nTarred and feathered, Eilish eventually goes up in flames herself as, in the background, silhouetted women dance sexily, like the singers she has deliberately positioned herself against. The video for the single all the good girls go to hell (the insistently nonchalant lower-case formatting is hers) has amassed 37m views in just five days, reflective of the controversy the clip has caused in corners of the internet.\n\nOn the Q&A website Quora, a conflicted fan fretted: \u201cCan I be a good Christian and like Billie Eilish\u2019s new music?\u201d On Twitter, a woman responded to Eilish\u2019s share of the video, saying: \u201cPrayers sent.\u201d \u201cNobody asked for your prayers, Tina\u201d came another fan\u2019s retort.\n\nPop stars playing with religious iconography is hardly a new idea: in March, Madonna marked the 30th anniversary of the Like a Prayer video, wherein she danced in front of burning crosses, kissed a black saint and caused so much controversy she claims it cost her a multi-million-dollar deal with Pepsi.\n\nMore recently, Lady Gaga portrayed herself as Mary Magdalene in the video for Judas, released close to Holy Week and Easter 2011, though Gaga said it was not a purposeful attack on religion: \u201cThe only controversial thing about this video is that I\u2019m wearing Christian Lacroix and Chanel in the same frame,\u201d she joked to E!.\n\nIn July, the SoundCloud rapper Lil Uzi Vert invoked the Rapture during his set at Wireless festival in London, telling his fans that they were \u201cgoing to Hell\u201d with him and that his hit XO Tour Llif3 was \u201cwhat it\u2019s going to sound like for eternity\u201d.\n\nFar from becoming immune to the shock tactics, however, some Christians seem to find Eilish\u2019s embrace of Satanic imagery especially concerning in light of her tender years. To quote from the Everyday Christian Parent blog: \u201cSatan no longer hides, and kids think its [sic] cool. \u2026 Contrary to Billie Eilish\u2019s songs of hopelessness, we have hope in Jesus.\u201d\n\nA closer reading of Eilish\u2019s lyrics suggests the outrage is misplaced: hills are burning in California, sea levels are rising, the Pearly Gates are a picket fence \u2013 far from idolising the devil, Eilish has confirmed the song is largely about the threat from the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s being ruined by us, you know \u2013 it\u2019s literally us,\u201d she said of the song in an interview. And all the good girls will find themselves in Hell along with the bad girls when it eventually comes to Earth.\n\nThose looking for hope after watching Eilish\u2019s video on YouTube might have found it in the description, where she has posted a personal note urging fans to take part in the global climate strikes on 20 and 27 September. The top tag is #climatestrike.\n\nAnd so Eilish\u2019s glory is revealed \u2013 praise be to Billie.\n\nElle Hunt", "description": "The video for the pop star\u2019s new single has outraged many Christians.
