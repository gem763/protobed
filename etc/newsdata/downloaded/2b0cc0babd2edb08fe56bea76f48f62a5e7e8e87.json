But you\u2019d be wrong.\n\nHis new seven-part BBC series, Seven Worlds, One Planet, covers new ground and reveals an animal Sir David has longed to track down since the 60s.\n\nBack then he read a scientific paper about China\u2019s golden \u00adsnub-nosed monkey, a loner who lives in dense forest. But he could not get into China.\n\n(Image: BBC Studios/Nick Green)\n\nSir David said: \u201cIt is a wonderful creature. I\u2019ve never seen a film of it before. I always had it in the back of my mind and this lot (his crew) got it. The footage shows the \u00admonkeys have snubbed noses to stop them getting frostbitten.\u201d\n\nA dozing sloth, rare indri lemur and a nearly extinct bird of \u00adparadise also feature in the hour-long programmes that look at each of the seven continents.\n\nFilming the series, which starts in the freezing, hostile Antarctica, was a huge task. A crew of more than 150 went on 80 expeditions in 41 countries and filmed more than 2,000 hours of footage.\n\n(Image: BBC NHU/Alex Board)\n\nSir David said the challenge was to make the series distinctive.\n\nHe said: \u201cEach of these \u00adcontinents has a different \u00adgeological issue.\n\n\u201cThey have \u00addifferent ways on how life has \u00adarrived there and how they survive in isolation.\n\n\u201cEvery one of our shows has one or two sequences that take my breath away and have never been seen before.\u201d\n\nAmong some of the gripping images in the series are shots of huge starfish under sea ice, a mum and baby orangutan and the once critically \u00adendangered Iberian lynx. There is also footage of cute Weddell seal pups and a \u00adcolony of nervous gentoo \u00adpenguins.\n\n(Image: BBC/Nick Green)\n\n(Image: BBC Studios/Fredi Devas)\n\nSir David said: \u201cI would like the audience to appreciate how beautiful these things are. But also how they \u00adintegrate with others and how we are dependent on them.\n\n\u201cEach continent has its own systems. Our influence is \u00adeverywhere and we\u2019ve made a tragic, desperate mess of it so far.\n\n\u201cBut at last \u00adnations are coming \u00adtogether and recognising we all live on the same planet.\n\n\u201cAll these \u00adseven worlds are one and we are \u00addependent on it for every bit of food we eat and every breath we take.\u201d\n\n(Image: BBC Studios/Chadden Hunter)\n\nSir David\u2019s programmes have hugely influenced how people see their world. Blue Planet 2 was crucial in raising awareness about plastics in seas.\n\nBut the film crew are very \u00adcareful about how they interact with the natural environment.\n\nSir David said: \u201cIn some \u00adcircumstances when the animal is in isolation, like a penguin, if it gets into trouble maybe you can help it and that\u2019s OK.\n\n(Image: BBC Studios/Fredi Devas)\n\n\u201cBut when you have a \u00adcheetah stalking a baby \u00adantelope, if you interfere with it you are likely to cause more trouble than not.\n\n\u201cIf you frighten the cheetah away, you frighten the \u00adantelope. The cheetah will be without its food and it will go and find another one.\n\n\u201cSo you end up causing more problems if you don\u2019t let \u00adnature takes its course. Those baby cheetahs have to feed so you have got to be careful that you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nSir David, who was knighted in 1985, admitted he is \u00adfinally slowing down. For the new series he \u00adtravelled only to Kenya and Iceland.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am reasonably active and I can walk around but I can\u2019t walk for five hours a day with a heavy rucksack.\n\n(Image: BBC NHU/Alex Board)\n\n\"I don\u2019t think you should fly just for the hell of it. Apart from \u00adanything else the BBC would be absurd to spend money on unimportant air flights.\n\n\u201cI make television programmes. Before that I was a zoologist.\n\n\u201cTo be able to spend my life combining those two things has been great luck.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to see a jungle. I thought there\u2019d be \u00admonkeys hanging from every tree but it was not like that.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have \u00adchemistry with animals particularly. It is easy to empathise with our closest relations but you can\u2019t empathise with a millipede or a bird.\u201d\n\nDavid has no plans to retire and has TV \u00adprojects lined up for 18 months.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen you are 93, 18 months is quite significant. Who knows what will happen. Your voice changes and if you are not careful, maybe it becomes aged. Maybe it has nothing to do with care.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA Wire/Press Association Images)\n\nHis wife Jane died in 1997 and daughter Susan helps run the house now.\n\nHe said: \u201cLosing your wife is a traumatic and devastating experience. It changed my life profoundly. On the other hand my son and \u00addaughter were grown up and established in their careers.\u201d\n\nHe said he was \u201cvery lucky\u201d to have Susan helping him.\n\nAnd despite his age, death is not a taboo subject.\n\nHe said of it: \u201cI think nothing happens, to be truthful. I am \u00adworking on that basis. I am not such an atheist that I say with \u00adconfidence or true belief that there is no God.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHe recalled cutting open a termite mound to film \u00adinside and thinking the blind \u00adworker insects did not know what was happening.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey don\u2019t have the \u00adsenses. I can\u2019t help think that we don\u2019t have a particular sense. So I am \u00adresistant to saying without question \u2018There is no God.\u2019 I cannot say that.\u201d\n\n\u201cLife is precious. I have had fantastic luck \u2013 doing this since the 50s.\u201d Not as lucky as your audiences, Sir David.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The national treasure is back and he can't wait for viewers to see the elusive golden snub-nosed monkey", "authors": ["Ed Gleave", "Marc Baker", "Image", "Bbc Nhu Alex Board", "Bbc Studios Nick Green", "Bbc Nick Green", "Bbc Studios Fredi Devas", "Bbc Studios Chadden Hunter", "Pa Wire Press Association Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653992.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Seven-Worlds-One-Planet.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
