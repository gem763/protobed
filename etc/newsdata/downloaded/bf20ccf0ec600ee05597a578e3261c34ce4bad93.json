Here\u2019s a list of titles in the works, including the release date of the original.\n\nThe Lion King\n\nThis highly anticipated live-action remake of 1994\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King\u201d will hit theaters in July, and is Jon Favreau\u2019s follow-up to his successful \u201cJungle Book\u201d remake. Seth Rogen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover, Beyonce, Billy Eichner, Keegan-Michael Key and more star.\n\nMaleficent: Mistress Of Evil\n\nAdapted from 1959\u2019s \u201cSleeping Beauty,\u201d the first \u201cMaleficent\u201d helped energize Angelina Jolie\u2019s career and introduced an entire generation to the tale\u2019s terrifying villain. Now, its sequel will hit theaters in October and will also stat Ed Skrein, Michelle Pfeiffer and Elle Fanning. Joachim Ronning directs.\n\n\n\nMulan\n\nThis is a particularly anticipated title, slated for release on March 27, 2020. Niki Caro is directing, while Liu Yifei is starring as the titular character. Donnie Yen and Jason Scott Lee also star.\n\n\n\nJungle Cruise\n\nOkay, okay, \u201cJungle Cruise\u201d might not count as live-action based on a previous animated classic, but it is based on a ride at Disneyland, so we\u2019re going to include it. Plus, we\u2019ll take any chance to talk about Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt in the same sentence. But we\u2019re still a long way away from its release: it will hit theaters July 2020.\n\nPinocchio\n\nPinocchio is the next up to go into production, with Tom Hanks playing Geppetto. \u201cPaddington\u201d director Paul King is attached to direct.\n\nCruella\n\nExtracted from the famous villainess of 1961\u2019s \u201cOne Hundred and One Dalmatians,\u201d this origin story of a woman who declares open season on purebred puppies\u2013 Cruella DeVil \u2014 is set to star Emma Stone. The reigning live-action Cruella is Glenn Close, who herself starred in two live-action adaptations.\n\n\n\nJames and the Giant Peach\n\nIn one of the more interesting adaptations, this beloved Roald Dahl book became a quirky claymation hit for Disney in 1996 with director Henry Selick. Heavy dramatist director Sam Mendes was attached to take a stab at it, but he has since dropped out.\n\n\n\nRose Red\n\nThis one is trippy (no pun over producer Tripp Vinson), but promising creatively. In the German fairy tale, Rose Red is Snow White\u2019s sister. Disney and Vinson are collaborating on introducing the world to the sibling of the famous apple-loving princess. Disney released the original \u201cSnow White\u201d in 1937.\n\n\n\nTinker Bell\n\nThis movie has also been in the works for quite some time, with Reese Witherspoon attached as the cute little fairy from \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d\n\nSnow White\n\nForget her sister \u2014 the original baddest chick in the Disney animated kingdom is coming back for her own standalone film. It was announced at the end of October 2016.\n\n\n\nPeter Pan\n\nNeverland will get a practical set if Disney has its way updating the 1953 animated film.\n\n\n\nOliver Twist\n\nWhile Disney never formally made a direct animated take on Charles Dickens\u2019 beloved orphan, they did release the adorable 1988 \u201cOliver and Company,\u201d inspired by Dickens\u2019 tale but told with animals. They also made a small-screen live-action version in 1997 with Richard Dreyfuss.\n\n\n\nSnow White (1937)\n\nForget her sister \u2014 the original baddest chick in the Disney animated kingdom is coming back for her own standalone film. It was announced at the end of October 2016.\n\n\n\nThe Jungle Book 2\n\nThis is a no-brainer follow-up to Favreau\u2019s hit from spring 2016, based on the animated classic released in 1967.\n\n\n\nOliver Twist\n\nWhile Disney never formally made a direct animated take on Charles Dickens\u2019 beloved orphan, they did release the adorable 1988 \u201cOliver and Company,\u201d inspired by Dickens\u2019 tale but told with animals. They also made a small-screen live-action version in 1997 with Richard Dreyfuss.\n\n\n\nLady And The Tramp\n\nAnother film that is in some stage of development but has no active release date is \u201cLady and the Tramp.\u201d Tessa Thompson is set to voice Lady, while Justin Theroux is attached to play Tramp. Other cast members include Ashley Jensen, Janelle Monae, Kiersey Clemons, Benedict Wong and Thomas Mann. Charlie Bean is directing.\n\nLilo & Stitch\n\nAnd another film that is supposed to get the live-action treatment and some point. This project was announced in October with Mike Van Waes attached to pen the script. Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich of Rideback are producing.\n\nHunchback\n\nEarlier this year, a live-action film based on 1996\u2019s \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\u201d was announced. Tony-winning playwright David Henry Hwang was tapped to pen the script, with Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz handling the music.\n\nRead original story 16 Live-Action Disney Movies in the Works After \u2018Maleficent: Mistress of Evil\u2019 (Photos) At TheWrap", "description": "Disney will be pumping out live-action versions of their animated classics for a long time time to come.
