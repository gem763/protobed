If you break it down - we have the best front-row in the world, the best second-row and the best back-row. At this point we have the best of each row in the pack.\n\nThe Kamikaze Kids - Sam Underhill and Tom Curry - give England a huge advantage, and that will be telling on Saturday having breakdown specialists.\n\nNick Easter (second from right) believes England will get revenge for the 2007 World Cup final\n\nSouth Africa ran out winners in Paris but England will get a chance at revenge out in Japan\n\nI don't think Rassie Erasmus will change anything for South Africa - he won't drop the captain Siya Kolisi, Pieter Steph du Toit or Duane Vermeulen - so I see another field-day for our boys on the ground.\n\nWe have got ball carriers who are ball players - the likes of Kyle Sinckler, Mako Vunipola and Billy Vunipola have hands like centres as well as power.\n\nSouth Africa will be physical, but when you're moving the point of attack with the ball and you're getting front-foot ball with it it doesn't matter how good your defence is, you're going to struggle.\n\nBecause South Africa have such big lumps their lineout isn't overly complicated - they tend to use their locks more and just try and beat teams for height.\n\n'Kamikaze Kids' Sam Underhill (left) and Tom Curry (centre) can make the difference in the final\n\nSouth Africa have been criticised for their style at the Rugby World Cup - but they don't care\n\nThat'll be an area England's lineout guru Steve Borthwick will target.\n\nI respect the Boks hugely - they can move the ball \u2013 but all I have seen is centre Damian De Allende crashing it up and a maul from the Boks.\n\nOur defence is just as strong as theirs, our attack is as good as anyone's in the world, and so it comes to the top two inches. Who is going to crack first? John Mitchell has been huge for England working on the defence- before he came in England shipped 60 to the Barbarians and 40 in the first Test in South Africa.\n\nEngland have more players who have played in big games than they have. South Africa will perceive themselves to be underdogs - that's a dangerous proposition.\n\nSouth Africa can mix the brute force with an expansive style, but I can't see it happening because they've shown none of that at this World Cup and it's a six-day turnaround.\n\nRassie is very pragmatic, he will go with tried and tested, will rev up his forwards and make it about the physical stakes.\n\nThe physicality thing is true, but it is slightly over-done. We have huge athletes and big boys as well.\n\nSQUADS FOR THE 2007 RUGBY WORLD CUP FINAL IN PARIS FB 15 Jason Robinson RW 14 Paul Sackey OC 13 Mathew Tait IC 12 Mike Catt LW 11 Mark Cueto FH 10 Jonny Wilkinson SH 9 Andy Gomarsall N8 8 Nick Easter OF 7 Lewis Moody BF 6 Martin Corry RL 5 Ben Kay LL 4 Simon Shaw TP 3 Phil Vickery (c) HK 2 Mark Regan LP 1 Andrew Sheridan Replacements: HK 16 George Chuter PR 17 Matt Stevens N8 18 Lawrence Dallaglio FL 19 Joe Worsley SH 20 Peter Richards FH 21 Toby Flood CE 22 Dan Hipkiss Coach: Brian Ashton FB 15 Percy Montgomery RW 14 JP Pietersen OC 13 Jaque Fourie IC 12 Fran\u00e7ois Steyn LW 11 Bryan Habana FH 10 Butch James SH 9 Fourie du Preez N8 8 Danie Rossouw BF 7 Juan Smith OF 6 Schalk Burger RL 5 Victor Matfield LL 4 Bakkies Botha TP 3 CJ van der Linde HK 2 John Smit (c) LP 1 Os du Randt Replacements: HK 16 Bismarck du Plessis PR 17 Jannie du Plessis LK 18 Johann Muller FL 19 Wikus van Heerden SH 20 Ruan Pienaar FH 21 Andre Pretorius CE 22 Wynand Olivier Coach: Jake White\n\n\n\nEaster (centre, pictured in 2007) believes England's current crop have big-game experience\n\nBoks head coach Rassie Erasmus will stick with tried and tested when his side face England\n\nSouth Africa's limited, combative style was highlighted in their semi-final win over Wales\n\nTraditionally England, South Africa and France produce the biggest lumps. That hasn't changed.\n\nWhat they do have - whether you are an amateur or a Springbok - is a willingness to hit people hard. An in-built aggression across the board.\n\nTo be honest, it's to their detriment though. I have coached the Sharks in two Currie Cups and then in Super Rugby too. It was brilliant. Rugby is rugby - it's not a different sport over there as much as people try to make it out.\n\nWe tried to play more of an expansive style at the Sharks - the Bulls and the Stormers do more what South Africa do, no rugby in your own half.\n\nWe tried to move the ball into space and keep it alive without forgetting the roots.\n\nSouth Africa haven't been easy on the eye at this World Cup and I don't see that changing. In six days you can't change much.\n\nRassie is a wily coach and he's forward-orientated. When you only had to put two front-rowers on the bench, he would put three on there just to have an extra forward.\n\nEddie Jones has set out England's destiny since their shock elimination back at home in 2015\n\nEaster, who has experience as a player and a coach, believes England can control the contest\n\nIt's been disappointing in the World Cup that they've not played more of an expansive style, but you can't complain if it takes you to a final.\n\nIf England play with the composure they've shown they will control the game. They just seem mentally and physically on it.\n\nI just feel it is their destiny, what Eddie Jones has set out for them. You can see that hurt from the last tournament (which I was involved in at the end) sits with a lot of them as well.\n\nI hope they complete the job. I won't be able to deal with all the texts coming through from the Sharks boys if they don't win!", "description": "NICK EASTER - 2007 WORLD CUP FINALIST: The Kamikaze Kids - Sam Underhill and Tom Curry - give England a huge advantage, and that will be telling on Saturday having breakdown specialists.", "authors": ["Nick Easter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/12/20323828-0-image-a-73_1572351259721.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
