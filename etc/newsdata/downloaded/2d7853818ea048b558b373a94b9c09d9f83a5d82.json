The balance of power has shifted away from the government, exacerbated by the weak performance of Hong Kong\u2019s political institutions. The anti-mask regulation, introduced on October 4, has not yet helped authorities gain some control over the protests.\n\nA protester prepares to throw a molotov cocktail at the Tsim She Tsui police station during the latest weekend of violence. AP\n\nA power vacuum brings risks beyond those of street politics. Like it or not, the weakness of Hong Kong\u2019s political institutions could mean that Beijing increasingly seeks to guide socio-economic change in Hong Kong in ways not previously envisaged. Its recent rhetorical intervention targeting property developers is an example.\n\nUnrest looks set to continue. Radical protestors have dug in for prolonged urban warfare against the government, police and even Hong Kong\u2019s mass transit rail system, using increasingly violent measures.\n\nDialogue and compromise are not on their agenda, only the pursuit of goals and ambiguous slogans which are unlikely to be realised under Hong Kong\u2019s current political framework. The government continues to resist the demand which attracts most popular support \u2014 for an independent commission of inquiry \u2014 without explaining convincingly why it opposes the idea.\n\nThe persistence and scale of the protests also reflect deep dislocations in Hong Kong, ranging from a fundamental dislike of Beijing to localist or independence sentiment, protectionist identity politics and socio-economic problems. These go beyond questions about the constitutional arrangement of \"one country, two systems\".\n\nGiven the depth of the wounds and hatred, there is little chance that Hong Kong\u2019s problems will be solved. There is no consensus on what a political solution looks like.\n\nBut can things to some extent managed?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChief Executive Carrie Lam\u2019s annual policy address, delivered last week, was an opportunity to set out a way forward. Lam focused on housing, land supply, livelihood issues and economic development, announcing a raft of measures and the goal that every family would be able to have \"their own home in Hong Kong\".\n\nThis could contribute positively to the longer-term challenges facing the city, though housing in particular will remain a running sore. More could probably be done in the short term with Hong Kong\u2019s fiscal surplus and reserves, targeting sectors most affected by the turmoil and finding ways of ensuring that money reaches the grassroots.\n\nLam ended up delivering her address by video link, after disruption of the legislative sitting by opposition lawmakers. This shows the limited appetite for dialogue across the community, following a set-piece dialogue on September 26 which, incidentally, highlighted the differences between Hong Kong and the rest of China.\n\nBefore her address, Lam rejected calls for immediate resumption of political reform, even though this is again moving up the popular agenda - and seen by some as a panacea. The problem remains that changes require a broad consensus.\n\nProgress on universal suffrage needs agreement by the central government, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government and two-thirds of the legislature. This is where things came unstuck in 2014, when it was opposition legislators, not the government, that vetoed change. Prospects for consensus look even bleaker now.\n\nIn spite of the challenges facing Hong Kong, the cacophonous politics of this summer have highlighted the distinctive nature of Hong Kong\u2019s system, and the ability of its citizens to express their views locally and internationally.\n\nThe city\u2019s wider value for China and international business needs to be retained, even as the US Congress seems determined to make its distinctiveness more difficult to maintain with the passage of a new Hong Kong Act, the most likely impact of which will be an erosion of confidence in Hong Kong and a reduction in its actual autonomy.\n\nForeign governments have been heavily lobbied to \"stand with Hong Kong\". But to do this effectively requires understanding the full range of views across the community \u2014 not just those who lobby in Washington, London or Canberra. It also means giving some support to the Hong Kong government and encouraging it to find the right balance between the interests in Hong Kong and those in Beijing, difficult though this may be politically.\n\nMost important of all, this wave of violence must come to an end. Unless this happens, Hong Kong\u2019s society may never recover from the current crisis.\n\nTim Summers is a Senior Consulting Fellow of the Asia-Pacific Program at Chatham House and Lecturer at the Centre for China Studies, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).
