But, boy, do passions run hot when coffee preparation becomes the subject of a discussion. Take this recent Kickstarter, called The Automatica, as a good example. What I see is a cute gadget with a really appealing promo video. Set to a minimalist soundtrack of guitar strumming and engine rumbling, the video treats us to a view of the Salt Lake City skyline at sunset before moving on to pleasing closeups of bubbles foaming up as the coffee is filtered through the machine. The narration is calming and friendly. I kind of want to hang out with the makers of this gadget, they seem like good, chilled-out people.\n\nCoffee-loving gadget nerds, though, they see through all of this facade and ask, \u201cwait, isn\u2019t this just a kettle that tilts?\u201d To which the brief answer is \u201cyes.\u201d The longer answer, as per the Kickstarter pitch, is that the Automatica \u201ccontrols temperature, flow rate, volume, pour pattern, and time so you don\u2019t have to.\u201d My colleagues are in uproar over this completely unnecessary design \u2014 engineered solutions for automated pour over coffee already exist and they\u2019re self-contained little boxes \u2014 but, in all honesty, I like it exactly because it\u2019s unnecessary. The tipping motion is like a one-step Rube Goldberg machine, and for me it triggers childhood memories of quirky inventions I\u2019ve seen in comics and animated movies where the human is replaced by a clumsy mechanical concoction.\n\nIn the end, though, my sober friends are right. Mostly because of the price of this thing. Were it a cheap and fun little gadget, we\u2019d give it a pass. But The Automatica costs a ridiculous $450 for early backers and aspires to an MSRP that\u2019s $250 higher. All that and the Kickstarter doesn\u2019t even include any images of existing prototypes. Just a slick promo video. So it\u2019s neither for casual design fans like me nor for coffee enthusiasts who expect a tiny bit more engineering than just a timed tilting mechanism. In other words, don\u2019t back this, just enjoy the video.", "description": "The Automatica is a crazy expensive Kickstarter solution to the problem of automating pour over coffee", "authors": ["Vlad Savov", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GlxCojH0btUBNzCNiTkIFCDSvs0=/0x49:680x405/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12319315/4b48454f8db063563264978bfe195b9a_original.jpg", "published_at": "2018-08-20"}
