Grand Designs UK\u2019s big man Kevin McCloud is headed down under with his live show, with a string of nights across the country throughout February.\n\nKev\u2019s been the ever-sceptical and delightfully British observer over the last 20 years as folks from all over the UK countryside have brought to him their lofty dreams and ideas of building their homes, from shipping containers plonked in the middle of a Scottish meadow to the dealbreaker of a home built on the cliffs of Devon (which actually ended in the couple splitting up over it.)\n\nI mean just listen to his pure disbelief about this couple wanting to build a huge brutalist building in the middle of gorgeous countryside.\n\nHe\u2019s truly seen the whole spectrum of human emotion as the stressful process of building a dream home unfolds, warts and all, and he\u2019s bringing his wealth of knowledge \u2013 and frankly incredibly interesting personal life and early days in theatre design \u2013 to stages across Perth, Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, and Hobart in 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s pitched as a theatre show, but let\u2019s be real we\u2019re all gonna go to just here his beautiful British dulcet tones and wildly descriptive and emotive language about peoples\u2019 dreams and how they turn that into a home.\n\nSeriously, this shit is like architecture ASMR.\n\nOh, and if you\u2019ve got a burning question for Kevin McCloud, each show will have a Q&A so you can piff you grandest design queries to the man himself.\n\n\u2018The World According To Kevin\u2019 hits Perth\u2019s Concert Hall on Feb 13, Adelaide\u2019s Festival Theatre on Feb 15, Melbourne\u2019s Hamer Hall on Feb 16, Brissy\u2019s QPAC Concert Hall on Feb 20, Sydney\u2019s State Theatre on Feb 21, Canberra\u2019s Theatre Centre on Feb 23, and finally round out at Hobart\u2019s Wrest Point on Feb 25.\n\nIf you wanna get along to the show, presale tickets are going on sale from November 4 and Melbourne\u2019s presale begins on November 11. For more ticket information and to join the waitlist, you can check out the tour\u2019s website.", "description": "Noted king of architecture porn, Kevin McCloud, has announced a tour of Aus, where he'll explore two decades of the show and take yr burning questions.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/kevin-mccloud-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
