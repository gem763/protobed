But senior EU sources said the developments in London had left the situation in flux and an announcement was expected on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nThe Guardian view on Boris Johnson\u2019s election demand: MPs should call his bluff | Editorial Read more\n\nSuggestions that the Labour leader could reject Johnson\u2019s demand for a general election on 12 December provoking the prime minister to pull his deal set alarm bells ringing.\n\nSources said the French government wanted to see the outcome of the vote on a general election before making a decision, but that the other 26 member states were ready to grant the three-month extension.\n\nThe final offer could differ from the extension requested in the Benn act by specifying that the UK could leave on 15 November if the deal was ratified in the UK and European parliament.\n\nBefore Johnson\u2019s ultimatum to the Labour leader, the EU looked set to offer a three-month extension, which could be cut short at the point at which the Brexit deal was ratified.\n\nIt remains the most likely outcome. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be dragged into British politics and this is what was requested,\u201d said one senior EU diplomat. \u201cThey can leave earlier if they ratify the deal. To echo your prime minister, we just want Brexit done.\u201d\n\nBut France\u2019s EU minister, Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, told RTL radio that clarity over the next steps in London were needed for decisions to be made in \u201cthe next hours and days\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cOur position is that simply giving more time \u2013 without political change, without ratification, without an election \u2013 would be useless \u2026 The French position is to give more time if it is justified, if we understand why more time is needed. That could be more time to ratify, because there\u2019s a deal on the table. Or it could be because they say want to hold elections. Then we\u2019ll look at that.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s one thing to say we\u2019d like to maybe have elections and another thing to say elections have been organised \u2026 Simply giving more time alone leads to getting stuck in a rut. If there\u2019s a clear scenario that will change things, for example a ratification or elections \u2013 not just suggested but organised \u2013 then we can take decisions.\n\n\u201cBut we ask Britain for facts - we\u2019re not in fictional politics, we need facts to make decisions. Decisions will be taken in the next hours and days in terms of what the UK parliament says and what has really been actioned [in the UK]\u201d.", "description": "PM\u2019s threat to pull deal if Corbyn rejects general election leaves Brussels in state of fluxLiveblog \u2013 latest Brexit developments", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41bf6c988ebc868140431710f319f99d233aeed9/0_298_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b51b44f8dc8e999c5a3f98bc1da7beae", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
