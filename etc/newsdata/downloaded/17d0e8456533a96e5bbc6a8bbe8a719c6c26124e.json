(Sebastian Scheiner/AP)\n\nRabbi Joseph Berman\u2019s sermon for the Jewish High Holidays, which begin Sunday at sunset, highlights a core ethos of this new synagogue in Northwest Washington \u2014 Jews aren\u2019t just white people from Europe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to talk about how we are and always have been an \u2018Erev Rav,\u2019 \u201d Berman said this week, using a term from Exodus defined as the \u201cmixed multitude\u201d of people who fled biblical Egypt with the Israelites.\n\nThe message will resonate with members of his New Synagogue Project, which is one of an increasing number of U.S. Jewish organizations that are challenging the modern American image of Jews as Jerry Seinfeld-ian (or Sarah Silverman-ish) and bringing much more visibility and voice to Jews whose roots are African American, Middle Eastern, Asian and everything in between. The trend has opened conversations on racism, equity of power in the Jewish community, conversion and what it means to be \u201creally Jewish.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this problematic narrative, that Jews of color are new to the community because they\u2019re converts or part of mixed marriages, and that\u2019s not true,\u201d Berman said. \u201cFor some Jews of color, that\u2019s part of their story, but there have always been Jews of color. It\u2019s where Judaism started.\u201d\n\nGroups and projects have been popping up increasingly around the country in the last couple years. Community leaders say the rising national conversation about racism has prompted a more intense confronting of how it plays out among white Jews. Jews of color in 2019 are also more comfortable challenging racism and institutional underrepresentation.\n\nThere are new synagogues like Berman\u2019s, which began last year in Petworth; new affinity groups within synagogues for Jews of color like the Kehilah Multiracial Engagement Project at the large Conservative synagogue Adas Israel; and new national groups like the California-based Jews of Color Field Building Initiative, which gives grants to efforts that are \u201cintentionally developing/nurturing environments in which multiracial Jewish community can thrive,\u201d according to its website. Their first year, they gave out $200,000.\n\n[How taking a break from tech for Shabbat brought new purpose to this Internet pioneer\u2019s life]\n\nSunday night begins Rosh Hashanah, the start of the Jewish calendar and an intense 10-day sacred period called the High Holy Days, or \u201cYamim Noraim,\u201d or Days of Awe. The period, which ends with Yom Kippur on Oct. 9, calls Jews to self-reflect, to turn to God, to repent, soul-search, forgive, move on with gratitude. It\u2019s among the most observed rituals for U.S. Jews, and the most likely time for them to come to synagogue (about 40 percent of Jews almost never, or never, go to synagogue, according to Pew Research. Another 35 percent attend sporadically for the High Holidays or other services).\n\nThe increased institutional attention to Jews of color during this time is taking different forms. For some, it\u2019s meant weaving personal and societal confessions for racism into the Yom Kippur confessional prayer, called Ashamnu, adding mass incarceration, police violence and racially unequal access to housing. With a spike in reported anti-Semitic hate crimes, U.S. Jewish institutions have been pouring more money into security, which often means uniformed police and visible firearms. Leaders of several institutions said they were thinking hard this year, with bigger crowds, at what security should look like in a diverse community.\n\nA phalanx of police conducting security checks \u201cis definitely a turnoff for folks of color,\u201d said Emma Rafaelof, 24, an international affairs policy analyst who is ethnically Chinese and was adopted by a Mom who is Ashkenazi (or Eastern European) and a father from Iran. She grew up in Colorado. \u201cSome may not want to come to services because they don\u2019t want to get into a situation where they\u2019re facing law enforcement.\u201d\n\nRafaelof is a team leader of the Jews of color group at Berman\u2019s Project. The group is called \u00adPOCISM \u2014 People of Color, Indigenous people and Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, the latter two terms referencing Jews with roots in the East, North Africa, or Spanish-speaking places. The group is keeping these issues in mind as they plan security this year.\n\nEstimates of the number of Jews of color vary. A Washington Post analysis of General Social Survey Data found that in this decade, 89 percent of U.S. Jews are white, down from 99 percent in the 1970s. The reason for the increase in Jews of color isn\u2019t clear, but it\u2019s happening as the country overall is diversifying. About one-third of married Jews have a spouse who is not Jewish, Pew Research found.\n\nWhile Jews in the United States have for centuries been considered legally \u201cwhite,\u201d they weren\u2019t until recent decades considered culturally part of the social mainstream \u2014 living largely in enclave and banned in some places from getting jobs, spots in universities, slots at clubs or houses in certain neighborhoods. Jews have a hugely wide range of views about what makes someone \u201cJewish\u201d \u2014 whether it\u2019s culture, theology, practice, birth, or a mix. Because of immigration peaks in the last century or so, many American Jews have roots in Eastern Europe, and are ethnically Ashkenazi.\n\nThe new movement to look at what some call \u201cAshke-normification\u201d challenges assumptions about what it means to look like and be Jewish.\n\n[How evangelical leaders surrounded Clinton during the last presidential impeachment process]\n\nThere was never one answer in Judaism, and it\u2019s only getting more complex.\n\nUnder Jewish law, Jewish status is defined by whether one\u2019s birth mother is Jewish. Much of institutional U.S. Judaism has broadened, including people as Jews if their fathers are Jewish or if they\u2019ve converted in a process recognized by one\u2019s community. This is not a small issue in more orthodox communities, and in Israel, where state rabbis in recent years have been tightening the restrictions on which conversions they will accept.\n\nFrom an official point of view, one cannot simply state that they accept Judaism and be recognized formally as a Jew, even in the more progressive parts of institutional Judaism. At the same time, much of institutional U.S. Judaism has been rapidly opening up to interfaith families and the inclusion of people exploring Judaism but who have not converted.\n\nSo the question of one\u2019s heritage isn\u2019t trivial in Judaism. However, to see these questions of legitimacy raised in otherwise liberal Jewish communities, where standards are fluid on everything from keeping the Sabbath to belief in God, to some smacks of simple racism.\n\nJews of color interviewed for this piece described entering Jewish spaces and being asked, essentially: Why are you here? Even if it\u2019s well-intentioned, Jews of color say, being asked if you\u2019re married to a Jewish person or converted is part of an \u201cothering\u201d that can push people out.\n\n\u201cHow can Jews of color be totally engaged if they\u2019re profiled on their way to synagogue?\u201d said Ilana Kaufman, executive director of the Field Building Initiative. \u201cJews of color are asked: Who do they know here? What\u2019s the rabbi\u2019s name? Someone using the facilities might be asked if they\u2019re janitorial staff.\u201d She said she believes there is some American Jewish anxiety around the topic of nonwhite Jews that\u2019s not unlike American anxiety and racism about national demographic shifts.\n\n\u201cThey worry about diluting Jewishness, that people of color celebrating their Jewish identity will eclipse our \u2018Jewishness.\u2019 It\u2019s like we\u2019re dealing with a finite pie,\u201d she said.\n\nNew efforts are focusing on racial sensitivity training for clergy and community leaders, leadership pathways for people of color and the inclusion of Jewish role models of color.\n\nCarla Mays, 39, a San Francisco planner and research analyst, is a board member of the Jewish Multiracial Network. Founded in the 1990s by parents working to support multiracial Jewish families, the Network is one of the older groups working on advocating for Jews of color.\n\nMays says she has limited patience with conversations that are limited to sensitizing language. She wants to see Jews of color have a fair crack at grants and leadership positions.\n\n\u201cWe want inclusion, not to talk about difference,\u201d she said this week. Mays, who is African American, traces her Jewish roots to her great-grandmother, who considered Judaism part of her religious identity. Growing up in Los Angeles, she saw how her mother and grandmother considered Judaism a core part of who they were and their heritage, but did not feel welcome in institutional Jewish life. Mays said she felt torn once she moved to San Francisco as she tried to balance between Jewish and African American spaces.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t worship in peace, and was constantly questioned about who I was. And I saw [young Jews of color] having to bear that brunt. . . . That\u2019s why I stepped into this role,\u201d she said of her work in the Network.\n\nAndrew Esensten has been studying and writing about Jews of color in the U.S. and Israel for a decade. He calls today \u201cthe most exciting time since then, because race and how it plays out in the Jewish community is finally being taken seriously.\u201d He studies everyone from Andy Cheng, a Chinese American convert who just became president of a major Palo Alto synagogue, to the Hebrew Israelites, a diverse group of people of color who believe they, not white people, are descendants of ancient Israel.\n\nRight now, he says, the focus of these new efforts is simple: Raising awareness about the diversity of Jewish people that has always been there.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s surprisingly harder than it might seem.\u201d", "description": "The trend has opened conversations on racism, equity of power in the Jewish community, conversion and what it means to be \u201creally Jewish.\u201d", "authors": ["Michelle Boorstein", "Religion Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5v3837tmAlzMHnv0Ruv2zxjo0jM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LB6KEDXCLQI6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
