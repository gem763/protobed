And during a prolonged era of struggles by American men and difficulties growing the sport, equipment makers face a challenge: how to make a product effective enough to help players have success if they pick up a racket, but safe enough to keep them healthy so they can stick with it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been focused on saving arm injuries for a long time,\u201d said Michael Schaeffer, Wilson\u2019s global product line manager for performance rackets and bags. \u201cBut generally it\u2019s been a bit of a trade-off, where you could get a really arm-friendly racket but it would lack in playability at some level.\u201d\n\nSchaeffer believes Wilson got both earlier this year with the launch of the Clash, saying it was more flexible than the old wooden rackets but more stable when balls were hit off-center, so it wouldn\u2019t vibrate as violently as many of today\u2019s rackets.\n\nUnlike a sport such as basketball or football, where the size and weight of the ball are roughly the same from the youth level straight the pros, a racket that\u2019s good for a tour player can be too much for children.\n\nWhile commentating on Stan Wawrinka\u2019s victory over Novak Djokovic - who himself has battled elbow and shoulder problems in recent years - John McEnroe noted that pro players nowadays are \u201cgoing heavier to help with the serve\u201d when it comes to their racket selection.\n\nYet a heavier racket is not only tougher to control for young players, but also more likely to cause injuries.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why John Isner, a Prince racket user who at 6-foot-10 is one of the biggest servers in tennis history, said he would be looking for \u201csomething light with a lot of power\u201d when choosing a racket for his children.\n\nPower actually didn\u2019t make the top five in a survey of what players sought in a racket when Wilson was developing the Clash, with 92 percent of respondents favoring control. By increasing how long the ball interacts with the strings - even by as little as half a millisecond - the ball can be angled better, keeping shots that may have been sprayed around the court in play.\n\n\u201cIf people try a sport and they\u2019re not successful, they don\u2019t have a level of enjoyment, a lot of times they won\u2019t go back. That\u2019s true of any sport,\u201d Wilson spokeswoman Kristina Peterson-Lohman said.\n\nIsner is the highest-ranked American man at No. 14. Andy Roddick is the last U.S. man to win a Grand Slam tournament, way back at the 2003 U.S. Open, and that long stretch of futility has likely hindered the sport\u2019s popularity.\n\nSchaeffer said statistics show participation in the U.S. has been flat to slightly down, which in turn has impacted the racket industry. While recreational players were formerly buying new rackets every two to three years, he said, that number had dropped to an average of every seven.\n\nThat has slowed the development of new products that could have benefited players, leaving some playing with equipment that was wrong for them.\n\n\u201cSome kids play with rackets that are too heavy, too small. The head size is too small. I think a lot of that comes into play,\u201d said Sloane Stephens, the 2017 U.S. Open women\u2019s champion who uses Head.\n\n\u201cObviously the racket companies are trying to make the best technology that are softer for your arm, softer to play with, longer lasting, keep your shoulders intact.\u201d\n\nOf course, even that can only do so much. Alena Spielberg, a former college tennis player whose two children are ranked junior players in North Carolina, has had wrist and elbow surgery. She changed her daughter\u2019s racket after she began feeling shoulder pain last winter, but believes bad technique or bad luck can outweigh good equipment.\n\n\u201cMy personal feeling is you can take preventive measures with your equipment - the weight, flexibility, tension and string composition - but wear and tear and the repetitive grind of tennis and other sports do take their toll,\u201d she said while attending the U.S. Open with her children.\n\nThe hard courts that the U.S. Open and the tournaments preceding it are played on are demanding on knees and hips. Schaeffer said that makes it more important for the racket manufacturers to do their part to preserve the upper bodies.\n\n\u201cNot only do we want to obviously have this racket be successful but we want to help grow the sport and we felt that the equipment at some level was a barrier for people to continue to play tennis because tennis elbow is such an issue and injuries are an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we felt that if we could create a racket that could keep people in the game and help them enjoy it more, we could help create more excitement and keep the participation in tennis.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Plenty of Roger Federer wannabes had the same experience when they first tried tennis.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Mahoney"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/05/us_open_tennis_68961_c0-809-2261-2127_s1770x1032.jpg?dae12917517d34d3c642bf3b25c9295159bbc4d8", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
