Apple just released iOS 13.1.2, just three days after iOS 13.1.1 was released. Both updates include bug fixes for the software that runs on Apple's iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.\n\nApple first released iOS 13 on Sept. 19 and followed that with the release of iOS 13.1 and iPadOS on Sept. 24. That update included new features, as well as bug fixes.\n\nThe changelog for iOS 13.1.2 lists fixes for iCloud backup, the camera app, fixes the flashlight not activating, a bug that \"could result in the loss of display calibration data,\" fixes the running of Shortcuts on the HomePod, and resolves a Bluetooth issue related to certain vehicles.\n\nApple being so proactive and responsive in fixing bugs and issues with the latest version of iOS and iPadOS is a welcomed thing, but it also proves complaints about iOS 13's reliability and performance during the beta program leading up to its release were accurate.\n\nHopefully, the majority of the larger issues are fixed now.\n\nAfter updating to iOS 13.1.2, are you still experiencing any issues?
