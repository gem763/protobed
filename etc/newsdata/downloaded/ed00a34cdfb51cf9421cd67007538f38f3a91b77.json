At the centre of each is a woman who has set herself against the male-dominated corporations we collectively know as big tech. What is happening is about high politics and the grind of government rather than street-level noise and mass activism, which is maybe why it still seems overlooked.\n\nThe frontrunner in the US Democratic party\u2019s crowded nomination contest seems to be the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. Over the past couple of years she has hardened her intentions to tackle the power of Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook. Thanks to leaked recordings of Mark Zuckerberg addressing a meeting of his staff, we know he seems to consider her plans an \u201cexistential\u201d threat that would \u201csuck for us\u201d, and that he would \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to fight them.\n\nHer point was effective: 'Facebook have decided to let political figures lie to you \u2026 while getting richer off the ads.'\n\nWherever the \u201cmat\u201d is, Warren seems to be there already. Ten days ago, she highlighted Facebook\u2019s mixture of massive power and abject irresponsibility by confronting Zuckerberg with its decision, taken last year, to exempt political ads from its rules on false and misleading content \u2013 something recently manifested in Trump campaign ads that tell demonstrable lies about Warren\u2019s Democratic rival Joe Biden. In response, Warren\u2019s organisation put material on Facebook that told users that Zuckerberg was a Donald Trump supporter \u2013 before pointing out the falsehood, and reminding users that the company has given the president \u201cfree rein to lie\u201d.\n\nHer basic point was punchy and effective: \u201cFacebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. They\u2019ve decided to let political figures lie to you \u2013 even about Facebook itself \u2013 while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies.\u201d\n\nIn response, with his usual cosmic levels of chutzpah, Zuckerberg used a speech last week to frame his blithe attitude to political lying in terms of free speech, citing Martin Luther King, claiming Facebook was founded in the wake of the Iraq war to ensure people had \u201ca voice\u201d (short correction: its origins actually go back to a \u201chot or not\u201d website for Harvard students) and that his company represents a new \u201cfifth estate\u201d central to the workings of democracy. The whole thing would have been funny, if it hadn\u2019t shown us Zuckerberg does not have the sensitivity or humility to match his company\u2019s power.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018If she got her way, Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp would be reversed.\u2019 Elizabeth Warren at a Democratic presidential primary debate in Ohio. Photograph: John Minchillo/AP\n\nTrue to the way that a news cycle tied to social media tends to work, the clash over political ads is already obscuring the key issues Warren is talking about. She has two big objections to the way Facebook and other tech giants exercise their power. One is how they have endlessly been allowed to acquire potentially threatening competitors \u2013 so if she got her way, Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp would be reversed. She would also classify big companies that offer their users an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties as \u201cplatform utilities\u201d, and if their annual global revenue exceeds $25bn (\u00a319bn), insist they cannot carry on selling their own products via the spaces they host.\n\nAs a result, Apple would no longer be able to offer Apple Music and Apple News on its online store, and Amazon couldn\u2019t hawk its own goods alongside those of third-party sellers. This is big stuff: whatever its chances of getting through a future Congress, it at least represents the kind of clear, coherent programme for starting to deal with big tech that has so far tended to get lost in a haze of ifs and buts.\n\nA parallel story is unfolding in Europe. For five years, the Danish former politician Margrethe Vestager has been the European commissioner for competition. Her record is studded with big moves on the same corporations targeted by Warren \u2013 among them, a demand for \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in unpaid Irish taxes from Apple, and a \u20ac1.5bn fine levied this year against Google for abusive advertising practices. Her take on social media is crisp: \u201cI would like to have a Facebook in which I pay a fee each month, but I would have no tracking and advertising and the full benefits of privacy.\u201d\n\nTrump thinks Vestager \u201chates the United States, perhaps worse than any person I have ever met\u201d, an opinion which seems only to have propelled her further: she is about to start work as European commission vice-president in charge of \u201cEurope fit for the digital age\u201d, and combine her anti-monopoly activities with a dedicated focus on tech.\n\nWhile Britain may be sailing off into whatever zero-regulation dystopia the Conservatives have in mind, Vestager wants EU countries to at last get to grips with what tech is doing to the most basic aspects of society. She apparently wants to prioritise people\u2019s control of their data, and insists that Europe\u2019s use of artificial intelligence must be within the kind of ethical guidelines absent in the US and China.\n\nWhat this will mean in practice is so far unclear. But it dovetails with EU plans for restrictions on facial recognition technology \u2013 and potentially, the kind of malignant AI lately chronicled in the Guardian\u2019s series on what automation is doing to the welfare state and how it treats poor and vulnerable people.\n\nThe great break-up of big tech is finally beginning | Matt Stoller Read more\n\nSomething is belatedly happening, on both the right and left, as well as in the heart of national governments: from France\u2019s new tax on the local profits of tech corporations to the US Federal Trade Commission\u2019s robust noises about their reach, the most unbridled kind of corporate power is at last being meaningfully contested.\n\nMeanwhile, every week seems to bring signs that the companies\u2019 old veneer of invincibility is cracking, something vividly highlighted by the mounting crises befalling Facebook\u2019s hubristic plans for a new online currency, which Zuckerberg will try to explain to a congressional committee this week. Big tech\u2019s lobbyists are clearly readying themselves for a series of showdowns about the extent of its power.\n\nThe key problem comes down to the difficulty of pursuing big tech in a world that it not only controls, but defines. We read about Warren and Vestager on the same feeds that dissolve even the best intentions into the usual meaningless noise. But, on a good day, what seems to be happening brings to mind the call to action that concludes Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism. \u201cIt is up to us to use our knowledge, to regain our bearings, to stir others to do the same, and to found a new beginning,\u201d she says. Maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 we are starting to see what that might look like in practice.\n\n\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon are rattled.
