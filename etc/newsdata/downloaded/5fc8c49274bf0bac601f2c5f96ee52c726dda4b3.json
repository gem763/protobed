Moehringer of the Wall Street Journal:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare in our lives when we envision and picture something and it comes together the perfect way you envision it. [Winning a title] was the only time in my life that happened, and that summer was the most exhilarating time. Every day I woke up I just felt so good about myself, so good about life.\u2026 That was a defining moment in my life\u2014not just my basketball life.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to reconcile those two quotes. I\u2019d love to hear Durant eventually explain.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he didn\u2019t relish the championship aftermath as much he initially expected but, looking back, now realizes how much he actually enjoyed it. The end of his time with Golden State wasn\u2019t totally pleasant. That might have provided perspective on the better times. Or maybe the difference is simply his mood on the day of each interview.\n\nDurant is continuing to try to find himself while in the public eye. That isn\u2019t easy, and it\u2019ll lead to contradictions like this along the way. I appreciate his openness, even when he\u2019s still difficult to understand.", "description": "Following his first NBA title, Kevin Durant said, \"After winning that championship (last season), I learned that much hadn\u2019t changed.
