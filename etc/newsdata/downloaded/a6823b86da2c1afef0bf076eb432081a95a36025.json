Indeed, the first planet they found, 51 Pegasi b, orbits a sun 50 light years away that heats its surface to more than 1,000 degrees centigrade, the award-giving academy said.\n\nWith numerous ongoing searches for more exoplanets, this science might eventually also \"find an answer to the eternal question of whether other life is out there,\" it said.\n\nAt a news conference in London, Queloz said the focus of research had now shifted from finding more planets to finding out more about them - about their atmosphere, chemistry and formation. Queloz also fielded inevitable questions about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n\"I can't believe that we're the only living entities in the universe,\" he said when asked if he believes \"aliens\" exist. \"The chemistry that led to life is everywhere, so I'm a strong believer that there must be life elsewhere.\"\n\nDARK MATTER\n\nPeebles thanked the Nobel committee for the award, although he said his advice to young people wishing to go into science would be not to be lured by the prospect of such prizes.\n\n\"The awards and prizes, well, they are charming and very much appreciated, but...you should enter science because you are fascinated by it. That's what I did,\" he told reporters by telephone after the award announcement.\n\nPhysics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week; William Kaelin, Gregg Semenza and Peter Ratcliffe shared the medicine prize on Monday for discoveries about how cells respond to oxygen levels. Nobel prizes were created in a bequest by Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901. This year's physics prize will be followed by the awards for chemistry on Wednesday, literature on Thursday and the peace prize on Friday.\n\nAmong the Nobels, physics has often taken centre stage with winners featuring some of the greatest names in the history of science such as Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and Niels Bohr, as well as inventors such as radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi.\n\nUsing theoretical tools and calculations, Peebles was able to interpret trace radiation from the infancy of the universe and discover new physical processes, the Nobel academy said.\n\nHe showed that matter readily seen around us, be it pebbles, mountains or stars, actually make up only 5%, with the rest made up of dark energy and dark matter.
