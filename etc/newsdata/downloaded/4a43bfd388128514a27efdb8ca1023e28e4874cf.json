A deterministic algorithm selects block validators based on the number of tokens a given node has staked in their wallet \u2014 i.e. deposited as collateral in order to complete the addition of the next block to the chain.\n\nTen largest crypto assets for staking, as of Oct. 2019. Source: Binance Research\n\nExcluding Ethereum, the cumulative staking market capitalization, as of Oct. 24, is worth around $11.2 billion \u2014 $6.4 billion of which is staked.\n\nLock-ups and liquidity\n\nAcross all blockchains, Binance\u2019s data indicates that 43% of tokens are staked vs. 57% in free circulation.\n\nAmong coins listed on its platform, altcoins Algorand, Tezos, and Cosmos displayed high staking ratios \u2014 the ratio of the amount staked at a particular point in time divided by the total circulating supply \u2014 at over 70% of coins staked. Tron and Qtum meanwhile exhibit a staking ratio of under 25%.\n\nBinance outlines the potential risk-return profile of staking as a passive investment strategy vs. active trading. It notes that entrants should analyze the possible liquidity risks posed by different blockchains\u2019 lock-up period.\n\nWhile some chains may allow users to \u201cun-stake\u201d their coins instantaneously \u2014 but forfeit any unclaimed rewards \u2014 others may entail a mandatory lockup period that renders funds illiquid and could lead to missed active investment opportunities.\n\nEthereum 2.0 to roll out in January 2020\n\nAs reported yesterday, a senior ConsenSys executive has revealed that Ethereum 2.0 validators can expect to earn from 4.6% to 10.3% as rewards for staking on an annual basis.\n\nTo become a validator, participants are required to hold a minimum of 32 Ether (ETH) \u2014 worth $5,952 by press time.
