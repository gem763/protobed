REUTERS/Gergely Szakacs\n\n\u201cWhenever there is a slowdown and we cannot speak of an acceleration of growth cycles, positions of balance always come to the fore,\u201d Varga told a meeting of Hungarian economists.\n\n\u201cWe must avoid fiscal profligacy and maintain fiscal discipline and rigour,\u201d Varga said.\n\nOn Thursday, central bank Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy said risks to global growth, such as Brexit, the U.S.-China trade war and a slowdown in the euro zone, mean Hungary should consider a new programme to bolster economic growth.\n\nVarga said, however, that the government\u2019s commitment to cut the budget deficit to 1% of gross domestic product and set aside fiscal buffers worth the same amount next year was the best approach to curb risks to growth in the current environment.\n\nIn the longer run, Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s government, which has sharply lowered Hungary\u2019s budget shortfall and public debt over the past decade, is aiming for a balanced budget.\n\n\u201cWe cannot say one week that we should do a budget with zero deficit and cut the shortfall as quickly as possible only to say the following week that we should start overspending and launch new stimulus,\u201d Varga said.\n\nHe said the budget must remain on a conservative path and Hungary should strive to maintain its high investment rate to keep convergence towards richer Western European peers on track.\n\nVarga said of about 100 new foreign investment projects in the pipeline, three have been scrapped for reasons he did not specify. Another three projects were on hold due to the global economic slowdown, he said.\n\n\u201cBut the overwhelming majority of these projects will be implemented,\u201d Varga said, adding that Hungary needed a stable and predictable exchange rate EURHUF=D3.", "description": "Risks to global economic growth are unlikely to trigger an outright recession, Hungary's Finance Minister Mihaly Varga said on Saturday, adding that the best way to tackle a slowdown was to maintain fiscal discipline and market stability.", "authors": ["Gergely Szakacs", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427239642&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860H1", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
