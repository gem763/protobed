The privately-funded space industry is still in its infancy, but there has been an explosion of startups and investors in the sector, and the fever has, in the last few years, spread to Europe. The development of SpaceTech startups will be crucial to the advancement of services we have come to rely on in our daily lives, be it navigation, delivery services or more.\n\nFor the past ten years, the SpaceTech sector has seen over $9 billion invested in it, roughly 60% of the space industry\u2019s investments.

The second is the huge and booming area of the data analytics market which is the underlying value of satellites.", "description": "A new space race is forming globally, energized by venture capital and the hype around companies like Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin.
