USA TODAY\n\nWelcome to the era of the Streaming Wars.\n\nHollywood is getting more crowded than ever as two new online streaming services, Apple TV+ and Disney+, join the digital fight for your eyeballs and money in November. And there's still more to come: Next spring, WarnerMedia's HBO Max and Comcast's Peacock join the mix.\n\nWith Netflix, Hulu and Amazon already dominating the streaming world, and smaller players like CBS All Access, Shudder and Acorn TV fighting for their place in the mix, the new TV landscape can be a daunting avalanche of choices, and subscribing to every new service can easily end up costing more than that cable bill you already cut.\n\nBut not all streaming services are created equal. Before you subscribe to the latest, consider our list of the major services, ranked from best to worst. We've included only services not available as a cable channel (sorry, HBO Now), and those streaming in 2019 (we\u2019ll get back to HBO Max and Peacock later).\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale was Hulu's first breakout hit. (Photo: Hulu)\n\n1. Hulu\n\nCost: $5.99/month with ads; $11.99/month commercial-free\n\nOriginals: A mix of award-winning high profile dramas (\u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d \u201cThe Act\u201d), tiny, quirky and acclaimed comedies (\u201cPEN15,\u201d \u201cShrill\u201d) and occasional theatrical or streaming-only films (\u201cLittle Monsters,\u201d \u201cFyre Fraud\u201d).\n\nLibrary: Includes currently airing TV shows on ABC, NBC and Fox (\u201cThe Masked Singer,\u201d \u201cStumptown\u201d) paired with archival series (\u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201d \u201cDesigning Women,\u201d \u201cSeinfeld\u201d) and films (\u201cBoyz n the Hood\u201d).\n\nKid-friendly? A robust kids' section has mostly older shows (\u201cSailor Moon,\u201d \u201cDoug\u201d) but a few originals like \u201cThe Bravest Knight.\u201d\n\nHulu tops our list because it's a broadly appealing service that offers plenty of genres and styles without scraping the bottom of the barrel for new content. The ability to watch current broadcast shows in-season is a huge advantage. And Hulu has the best selection of archival TV series with a solid showing of films, too. Its originals could be better, but the service has wisely chosen not to overload us with shoddy new programming, a mistake its biggest competitor, Netflix, has unfortunately made. Hulu\u2019s value is likely to grow in the next few years, now that Disney effectively owns the service. Adult Marvel content will likely gravitate here, along with a trove of FX series.\n\nSadie Sink, Noah Schnapp, Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, and Caleb McLaughlin in Stranger Things 3 .

Netflix\n\nCost: $8.99/month to watch on one screen at once, $12.99/month to watch on two screens or $15.99/month to watch on four screens in Ultra HD.\n\nOriginals: Has the largest crop of originals, which means the biggest mix in quality as well. Notables include \u201cStranger Things,\u201d \u201cQueer Eye\u201d and \u201cThe Crown,\u201d in addition to Oscar-bait movies like Martin Scorsese's \u201cThe Irishman.\u201d\n\nLibrary: Shrinking every year. Although some stalwarts remain on the service (\u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d \u201cDexter,\u201d \u201cSupernatural\u201d), Netflix is investing in originals, not in holding onto the rights for legacy series and films. (\"Friends,\" \"The Office\" and \"Parks and Recreation\" are among those shifting elsewhere by 2021 for U.S. subscribers).\n\nKid-friendly? Netflix\u2019s kids\u2019 section is massive, populated mostly with dozens of originals (A \u201cBoss Baby\u201d series, an upcoming \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d adaptation) and some library content (\u201cPokemon\").\n\nNetflix may be synonymous with the idea of streaming content, but while it pioneered the format, it hasn\u2019t perfected it. The service has a huge number of films and TV shows to choose from, but that library isn\u2019t as good as it once was. Netflix\u2019s biggest flaw is that it is abandoning its archival content in favor of an ever-more-mediocre slate of originals across all genres of TV and film. Some of these series are brilliant (\u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d), others are decent (\u201cQueer Eye\u201d), but most are poor facsimiles of better TV (\u201cOzark,\u201d \u201cFuller House\u201d). The movies that premiere on the service without a theatrical run (and thus, aren\u2019t vying for Oscars) have a distinct \u201cTV movie\u201d vibe. Still, Netflix is a really valuable service and the biggest name in the game, only slightly edged out by Hulu.\n\nPedro Pascal stars as the title character in the new Disney+ series, \"The Mandalorian.\" (Photo: Francois Duhamel, Lucasfilm Ltd.)\n\n3. Disney+\n\nCost: $6.99/month or $69.99/year (available Nov. 12)\n\nOriginals: The first Star Wars live-action series (\u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d), teen comedy \u201cHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series,\u201d \u201cToy Story\u201d spinoff \u201cForky Asks a Question\u201d and a slew of nonfiction series. More Star Wars and Marvel series are promised over the next few years.\n\nLibrary: The Disney Vault has opened, and classics (\u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\") and duds (\u201cThe Shaggy D.A.\u201d) alike will flood the service, along with recent blockbusters (\u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d) from the studio. Some titles inherited from the merger with 20th Century Fox (\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d) also are available.\n\nKid-friendly? Extremely. All content on the service is family friendly to some degree, to fit with the Disney brand.\n\nThe biggest threat to existing services comes from the biggest conglomerate in Hollywood. Disney is flexing its considerable muscle by offering its classic films paired with original series from its biggest brands: Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel. Its huge library is its biggest advantage, as is the ability to reboot and revive (\u201cLizzie McGuire,\u201d here we come). But the biggest disadvantage is the lack of diversity in programming. Everything here will be very Disney in tone and style, and the service has no plans for mature programming and mindless reality TV, which has its time and place. If you have kids, the value of the service goes up exponentially, but for those of us not trying to entertain tykes, other streamers have more to choose from.\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge takes a smoking break as the titular character in Amazon's \"Fleabag.\" (Photo: STEVE SCHOFIELD/AMAZON)\n\n4. Amazon Prime Video\n\nCost: $12.99/month, but comes with free two-day shipping\n\nOriginals: \"Jack Ryan,\" \"Bosch,\" \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" and lots of small, awards-friendly fare, a lineup that's changing rapidly as the company embraces genre shows like an upcoming \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series.\n\nLibrary: A wide assortment that most notably includes Masterpiece dramas(\u201cDownton Abbey\u201d), mid-2000s procedurals (\u201cThe Closer,\u201d \u201cBones\u201d), USA Network shows (\u201cMr. Robot,\u201d \u201cSuits\") and some older HBO programming.\n\nKid-friendly? Yes, Amazon includes originals like \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d and Nickelodeon series like \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d and \u201cDora the Explorer.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s TV output is perfectly acceptable, especially if you like quaint British television and series your grandparents will enjoy. The streamer excels at comedies (Emmy-winning \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d and \u201cFleabag\u201d) and has an impressive selection of British TV (\u201cDoctor Who,\u201d \u201cBroadchurch\u201d). Its library of old series and originals is not as big as Hulu and Netflix, but it does have Oscar-nominated films (\"The Big Sick\" and \"Manchester by the Sea\") acquired from festivals. Your money goes further, because it pays for two-day shipping with TV as a bonus, but it still offers a higher proportion of niche programming than its rivals. Unlike Netflix or Hulu, it can\u2019t replace your cable subscription all on its own, but its lineup will expand to include a fashion series from Tim Gunn and Heidi Klum and an expensive \u201cRings\" adaptation.\n\nSonequa Martin-Green returns as Michael Burnham for a third season of \"Star Trek: Discovery.\" (Photo: JOHN MEDLAND/CBS)\n\n5. CBS All Access\n\nCost: $5.99/month with commercials, $9.99/month without\n\nOriginals: \u201cStar Trek: Discovery,\u201d \u201cThe Good Fight,\u201d \u201cThe Twilight Zone,\u201d \u201cWhy Women Kill\u201d\n\nLibrary: Current (and recent) CBS series, classics (\u201cI Love Lucy\u201d) and movies (\u201cRocky\u201d).\n\nKid-friendly? Some library content like \u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch\u201d and \u201cEverybody Hates Chris,\u201d but nothing for preschoolers and no originals.\n\nDon\u2019t knock the Eye\u2019s streaming service until you\u2019ve tried it. It's a little on the expensive side for the number of originals, but its streaming shows have a better batting average when it comes to quality (\u201cThe Good Fight\u201d is one of the best shows on TV). In addition to CBS shows, its library includes a treasure trove of classic films and TV, such as \u201cHappy Days\u201d and \u201cThe Brady Bunch.\u201d However, it's still limited in scope, so seeing some episodes of \u201cStar Trek: Picard\u201d a few times a year may not be worth the expense.\n\nJennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon star in the new Apple TV+ series \"The Morning Show.\" (Photo: Apple)\n\n6. Apple TV+\n\nCost: $4.99/month; free for one year with purchase of an Apple product (available Nov. 1)\n\nOriginals: \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d \u201cSee,\u201d \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d \u201cDickinson,\u201d \u201cThe Elephant Queen,\u201d \u201cOprah\u2019s Book Club,\u201d and other new shows from M. Night Shyamalan and Steven Spielberg.\n\nLibrary: None\n\nKid friendly? Nope\n\nDespite its low price tag, Apple has a distinct disadvantage in value because it has no back library of classic shows or films. You could burn through their entire new catalog in a few weeks. And you wouldn\u2019t get much from binge-watching the new series, which include \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d a mediocre soap starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. The best of the bunch is alternate history drama \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d from the creator of \u201cBattlestar Galactica,\u201d but is it worth the money to see just one maybe-good show? Probably not.\n\nThree decades after \"The Karate Kid,\" Johnny (left, William Zabka) and Daniel (Ralph Macchio) face off again in \"Cobra Kai.\" (Photo: YOUTUBE RED)\n\nHonorable mentions: AcornTV, Britbox, Shudder, YouTube and Facebook Watch\n\nA few other, much smaller streaming services are vying for your wallet. AcornTV and BritBox are for serious Anglophiles (Acorn has more mysteries, Britbox has all of classic \"Doctor Who\"). Shudder is devoted to horror. Facebook Watch and YouTube are a mix of user-created and professional content. Facebook Watch has one good original series (\"Sorry for Your Loss\" starring Elisabeth Olsen); so does YouTube (\"Karate Kid\" sequel \"Cobra Kai\"). Facebook Watch is free if you have time for it, and YouTube also has a free tier, with ads.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/29/apple-tv-netflix-disney-all-streaming-services-ranked/2484448001/", "description": "How many streaming services do you actually need?
