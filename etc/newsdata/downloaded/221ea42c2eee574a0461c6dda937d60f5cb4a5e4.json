She already has been indicted by the Southern District of New York on obstruction of justice charges.\n\nA cache of emails obtained by the Dossier Center, which is a Russian opposition organization based in London, exposes the depth of foreign asset entanglement in Trump\u2019s America at the precise moment that the president\u2019s dealings with Ukrainian officials threaten to pull the Department of Justice and State Department into an unseemly impeachment fight.\n\nThe leaked emails offer an unprecedented look into the cynical world of Russia\u2019s remorseless influence campaign within the U.S. Veselnitskaya was representing a company called Prevezon, which was facing an American trial over a $230 million fraud that began in Russia and implicated the Russian authorities.\n\nAn American law firm that had been working for Prevezon at the direction of Veselnitskaya was barred from the case by an extremely rare writ of mandamus handed down by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals because of conflict of interest with a former client. Emails suggest BakerHostetler, a major U.S. law firm that has also worked for The Daily Beast and its parent company IAC, continued to operate as a kind of shadow counsel in what would have been a clear breach of the court order.\n\nOther emails suggest another court order was violated when the testimony given by a Russian witness leaked, endangering his life before he was due to return to New York to give evidence at the trial.\n\nIt was later reported in the Russian media that the witness\u2014Nikolai Gorokhov\u2014had fallen five floors from an apartment building in Moscow. He survived with a fractured skull. He said his fall was no accident, but could not remember exactly what happened.\n\nCristy Phillips, a former U.S. government prosecutor with the Southern District of New York (SDNY) who worked on the case, said she fears that the emails shared with The Daily Beast indicate deep corruption hidden within the American legal system.\n\n\u201cThe integrity of our judicial system depends on lawyers upholding their obligations as officers of the court. Most fundamentally, if a court issues an order, lawyers have to follow it and make sure that others on their side follow it. There were numerous senior lawyers on these emails and they all clearly violated a Second Circuit court order. And these were not inexperienced lawyers, several of them are former Department of Justice attorneys,\u201d she told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cWe're talking about a case where witnesses had died and other witnesses' lives and safety had been threatened. These were not low-stakes decisions.\u201d\n\nA WITNESS AT RISK\n\nThe cache of emails that detail Veselnitskaya\u2019s legal campaign and lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C., were shared with The Daily Beast by the Dossier Center, which is funded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, one of Putin\u2019s most prominent exiled critics.\n\nThe emails cannot be independently verified by The Daily Beast via a digital signature but elements contained within them including cell phone numbers, bank details, planning, email addresses, and hearing dates can be confirmed by cross-checking with subsequent court papers, lobbyist filings and other reporting.\n\nEmails from the same leak led to an indictment against Veselnitskaya, who has known Kremlin links, that was filed by prosecutors from the SDNY earlier this year. U.S. government officials obtained the emails\u2014first published by the Dossier Center and NBC\u2014which suggest that Veselnitskaya conspired directly with Russian officials to mislead an American court.\n\nLine Between Trump Tower Meet Lawyer Natalya Veselnitskaya and Moscow Gets Even Blurrier\n\nWhen Veselnitskaya was confronted with some of the Dossier Center emails on camera by NBC, she confirmed that she recognized some of the documents. She later told Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency that her emails had been hacked.\n\nNew emails from the same cache, which includes messages from and to Veselnitskya and her aide and translator Murat Glashev, shed light on Veselnitskaya\u2019s lobbying and legal campaign against the Magnitsky Act and appear to suggest that it may have been carried out in breach of another U.S. law and court orders.\n\nSome of the emails suggest the breaking of an order put in place by a New York court to protect the identity of Gorokhov, a Russian witness who testified in a sealed deposition. His evidence was hidden amid fears of reprisals back home.\n\nAccording to the Dossier Center leak, Veselnitskaya\u2019s lawyer, Mark Cymrot, wrote a series of emails concerned that his Russian client may have allowed details of Gorokhov\u2019s testimony to be passed on after she was granted access to the testimony under U.S. discovery laws\u2014but only under tight restrictions.\n\nThe emails suggest Gorokhov\u2019s secret deposition was leaked to Andrei Nekrasov, a Russian filmmaker who was making a pro-Kremlin movie against the Magnitsky Act at the time.\n\nAccording to an email dated April 17, 2016, Cymrot says to Veselnitskaya: \u201c[Nekrasov] was using part of Gorokhov\u2019s deposition and separately he said we showed him non-public information \u2026 we are under court order to keep [Gorokhov\u2019s] deposition and name confidential.\u201d\n\nNekrasov told The Daily Beast that he does not have this material in his possession. \u201cNeither Mark nor myself have done anything illegal, or just wrong, professionally or morally,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not recall anyone sharing any confidential material from that case with me.\u201d\n\nCymrot did not answer detailed questions put to him by The Daily Beast.\n\nPreet Bharara, who was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time, was so concerned about Gorokhov\u2019s safety that he submitted a letter to the judge under seal in October 2015 requesting additional measures to protect him. Bharara informed the court that \u201cMr. Gorokhov and his family are temporarily staying in the United States due to well founded concerns that they could be endangered by individuals in Russia seeking to prevent Mr. Gorokhov from testifying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's totally unacceptable that that information got out,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIt is on the record that the government took extraordinary measures to protect him. But at the end of the day, we could only protect him insofar as the defense respected the court order that said the information was highly confidential and should be shared with no one.\u201d It is not suggested that any leaked information from the case led to Gorokhov's fall.\n\nThe civil forfeiture case in question concerned allegations of money laundering by a company called Prevezon accused by American prosecutors of disposing of some of the proceeds of a $230 million dollar fraud in Russia. The defendant, Prevezon, eventually settled the case, paying $5.9 million.\n\nThe alleged fraud took on major geopolitical significance after the lawyer who uncovered it, Sergei Magnitsky, died in Russian custody amid allegations that the Russian state and its criminal accomplices had tried to cover it up. The Magnitsky Act, which sanctioned the individuals involved, was named in his honor after former client and fraud victim Bill Browder, a U.S.-born hedge-fund CEO, launched a global campaign for justice.\n\n\u201cTHE ADOPTION ISSUE\u201d\n\nThe emails also reveal new details about Veselnitskaya\u2019s efforts to have America\u2019s Magnitsky sanctions overturned on behalf of Moscow. The sanctions in question were targeted against corrupt Russian officials by the Magnitsky Act, which had infuriated President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn retaliation for the Magnitsky Act, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2012, Putin banned American adoptions of Russian babies. It was supposedly to discuss the so-called \u201cadoption issue\u201d Veselnitskaya met in Trump Tower with Jared Kushner, Don Jr. and Paul Manafort, who was chairman of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign at the time.\n\nOverturning the Magnitsky Act was one of Putin\u2019s top foreign policy goals at the time, and spawned an extensive lobbying and public relations effort.\n\nLeaked emails between Veselnitskaya and her American lawyers raise a number of potential legal issues in their campaign.\n\nBakerHostetler, a major firm that represents Major League Baseball and was briefly hired by House Republicans to sue President Barack Obama, never registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) to cover the work for Veselnitskaya and Prevezon. FARA registration is required to operate on behalf of foreign principals and a leading lobbying expert said the emails appeared to show that Baker did provide strategic and communications advice to Veselnitskaya and her employer, Denis Katsyv, who owns Prevezon.\n\nRussian Official Linked to Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Trump Tower Lawyer, Is Dead\n\nOn May 30, 2016, an email suggests Cymrot wrote to Veselnitskaya to prepare for an upcoming congressional hearing at which she would give evidence. \u201cDo you want us to prepare your written statement or at least the first draft? We also should prepare you for the questions.\u201d\n\nAfter the hearing, which took place in June 2016 during the trip to the United States when Veselnitskaya went to Trump Tower, Cymrot reached out again according to a leaked email to say that one of his colleagues had written a draft of Veselnitskaya\u2019s supplementary evidence to the committee. According to a leaked email dated July 27, he followed up to say that he had made some edits personally, and could deliver the document to Congress on her behalf.\n\n\u201cHere you have multiple pieces of evidence that would seem to trigger registration under FARA,\u201d said Brendan Fischer, the director of federal reforms at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that scrutinizes campaign finance and ethics. \u201cThese emails and documents certainly raise serious questions about whether Cymrot and BakerHostetler violated FARA by failing to register.\u201d\n\nBakerHostetler declined to comment.\n\nAnother part of the lobbying effort included an attempt to recruit Sen. Jeff Sessions, according to the leaked emails. Sessions had become the first senior Republican to formally endorse Trump in the presidential race in February. He would go on to be named U.S. Attorney General once Trump was elected.\n\nRinat Ahkmetshin, a former Soviet counterintelligence officer and Washington lobbyist, boasted that he had recruited the Alabama senator to launch an investigation into U.S. sanctions against Russia, according to a leaked email from Cymrot.\n\nAkhmetshin reportedly was hired by Prevezon before he started to get paid by an ostensible human rights NGO, which BakerHostetler and Akhmetshin helped to set up.\n\nTHE JEFF SESSIONS CLAIM\n\nThe leaked emails suggest Cymrot wrote to Veselnitskaya on April 17, 2016 to outline their progress: \u201cRinat has told us that Senator Jeff Sessions is willing to start an investigation into how the Magnitsky Law came about.\u201d\n\nAfter denying any 2016 contact with Russian officials during his attorney general confirmation hearing, Sessions admitted that he had failed to disclose meetings with the Russian ambassador. His story about whether he discussed the election with Sergei Kislyak changed over the months but even by October 2017\u2014when he appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee and confirmed his meetings with Kislyak\u2014he was still adamant that he had not discussed the sanctions with anyone. \u201cI don't believe I've ever had any discussion at any time about the Magnitsky Act,\u201d he said, under oath.\n\nSessions, who was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time, never did publicly call for an investigation into the Magnitsky Act.\n\nSessions\u2019 lawyer Charles Cooper told The Daily Beast that Sessions \"has no recollection of the matters discussed in the emails that you referenced. Nor do any of the people who were the relevant members of his Senate staff in 2016. Neither he nor his Senate staff recall meeting any of the people referenced in the email you sent. And he certainly did not pursue any kind of hearings or other inquiry into the Magnitsky Act, which he cosponsored in 2011.\u201d\n\nAnother arm of the pro-Kremlin lobbying effort was orchestrated by an ostensible NGO called the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation (HRAGIF).\n\nAt the end of April 2016, emails suggest a BakerHostetler invoice addressed to HRAGIF described professional services worth $111,387.45 which included issues relating to the Magnitsky list, which named the sanctioned individuals, \u201creview and markup materials regarding issues with Magnitsky Act,\u201d and \u201cmaterials for Congressional committee.\u201d It also included numerous line items on time spent discussing \u201clobbying registration requirements\u201d and \u201creview of \u2026 FARA requirements,\u201d as well as drafting the \u201ccertificate of incorporation\u201d to set up HRAGIF in the first place.\n\nAccording to a leaked email dated July 14, 2016, Cymrot wrote to Veselnitskya to explain the invoices. \u201cNatalia: I am attaching the HRAGIF and Prevezon matter,\u201d the email says. \u201cIt now contains 5 months of Baker time, which is largely support for the public relations effort.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems that the purpose in creating this nonprofit was to avoid registration under FARA, and they would not be the first law firm to try and use that tactic to avoid registration,\u201d Fischer, from the Campaign Legal Center, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThat's what Manafort did on behalf of the Ukrainian political party and it's also what helped lead to the charges against him because the evidence showed\u2014and he knew\u2014that the beneficiary of his activities was actually the Ukrainian political party not this innocuously named sham non-profit.\u201d\n\nPaul Manafort was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison on a raft of charges that stemmed from the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in U.S. politics.\n\nBROWDER, FOR AND AGAINST\n\nBefore working with Veselnitskaya for Prevezon, BakerHostetler previously had been engaged by Browder, a major target of Veselnitskaya and the Kremlin. BakerHostetler\u2019s John Moscow had signed up in September 2008 to help Browder bring a U.S. prosecution over the $230 million fraud even before Magnitsky was arrested in Russia. He met with the U.S. Department of Justice in December of that year to lay out the entire criminal enterprise.\n\nFive years later, by the time the DOJ finally acted against the Russian fraud when the Southern District of New York (SDNY) filed a forfeiture and money laundering claim against Prevezon in September 2013, BakerHostetler was about to effectively switch sides.\n\nIn October 2013, John Moscow appeared in court on behalf of Prevezon, having previously advised Browder\u2019s Hermitage, the alleged victim of the fraud implicating Prevezon. Crossing over to fight for the other side in a legal battle is not allowed under U.S. law. Browder\u2019s lawyers filed a complaint, which would ricochet through the courts for the next three years until the Second Circuit Court of Appeals eventually disqualified BakerHostetler from serving as counsel to Prevezon in October 2016.\n\nWhen handing down the disqualification, the judge explained why BakerHostetler must not be allowed to represent Prevezon after working so closely with Browder, who was now being accused of wrongdoing. \u201cThe danger here is not limited to BakerHostetler overtly using confidences in the litigation. There is a risk that BakerHostetler, while not explicitly using confidences, may use such confidences to guide its defense of Prevezon in other ways.\u201d\n\nEmails apparently sent to and from lawyers at BakerHostetler, however, suggest that the law firm continued to serve Prevezon as a kind of shadow counsel even after the disqualification.\n\nOnce that ruling had been handed down, leaked emails indicate that in November 2016 Cymrot at BakerHostetler suggested an alternative lawyer who could be hired by Veselnitskaya to work for Prevezon. In an email sent five months later, Cymrot said BakerHostetler had still discussed the case \u201con a regular basis\u201d and would continue to hold \u201cteam\u201d meetings with the new counsel.\n\nDespite being disqualified from taking part in the case, the emails suggest BakerHostetler helped draft the settlement with the U.S. government in May 2017 and even acted as a go-between passing on messages and an invoice from the new lawyer, Mike Hess. Hess did not respond to questions from The Daily Beast. BakerHostetler was asked about this and other allegations, but did not respond.\n\nA second new lawyer also joined the team. At the time, Faith Gay was working for Quinn Emanuel, the U.S. law firm that also replaced BakerHostetler in the Republican case against Obama when staff at Baker raised fears that the case was too heavily partisan.\n\nEmails indicate that she also continued to work with the disqualified BakerHostetler firm. According to a leaked email dated May 1, 2017 she wrote to Veselnitskaya and her colleague Glashev, reassuring them that she was still working closely with BakerHostetler. \u201cThe judge removed Baker from the case. We have been trying to talk with them informally as much as possible.\u201d\n\nGay declined to comment.\n\nWhen faced with possible disclosure of emails later that year, one of Gay\u2019s associates emailed Veselnitskaya on August 16, 2017 raising concerns that, \u201cDisclosure could also result in a question being raised about Baker representing Prevezon\u2019s interests well beyond the district court\u2019s disqualification of them as Prevezon\u2019s counsel.\u201d\n\nThe issue could be particularly sensitive because Prevezon\u2019s defense effectively accused Browder of committing the fraud.\n\nFormer prosecutor Phillips said: \u201cThey violated the very essence of the order.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
