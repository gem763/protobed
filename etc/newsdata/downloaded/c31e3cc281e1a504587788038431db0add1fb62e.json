There\u2019s a lot of breathless trying on in Zadie Smith\u2019s first collection of short stories \u2013 as if she\u2019s late to a fancy dress party but still can\u2019t decide what costume to wear. Or whether to go in fancy dress at all. Or maybe go to the cinema instead? There is autofiction here, along with formal experimentation, dystopian sci-fi, surrealism, social satire, parable and a story from the point of view of God that reads like a droll reflection on creative restlessness.\n\n\u201cTo me, it was beautiful to move between these parallel projects, never getting bogged down, not feeling defined by one way of doing things, feeling light, feeling free\u2026 Doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t avoidant behaviour,\u201d says the omnipotent creator in Blocked.\n\nEach of Smith\u2019s five novels, from White Teeth (2000) to Swing Time (2016), have danced from one identity to the next, shifting accent, cadence, tone. Meanwhile, her protean essay collections, Changing My Mind (2009) and Feel Free (2018), have revealed a terror of intellectual calcification. Changing her mind is essentially how Smith feels free. But it\u2019s also a trap. Even for a writer, Smith seems unusually anxious about time: wasting it, running out of it \u2013 or having it stolen from her. Time is freedom \u2013 to be curious. But aagh! Curiosity also takes a lot of time. Smith, now 43, suffers from a kind of intellectual Fomo, a rapacious interest in everything, which means just as she\u2019s trying to knuckle down and focus, she\u2019s giving herself more work.\n\nThe best stories here act as commentary on her fluctuations and doubts and blend her criticism with the energy and verve of her fiction\n\nIn Grand Union, the \u201cparallel projects\u201d proliferate. So, too, do her cultural references, from hip-hop duo Dead Prez to French poet and essayist Francis Ponge. There are 19 stories here, most set in the US (she teaches at New York University) and many of which ruminate on the conditions and attitudes that will best inspire creativity.\n\nIn Downtown, the narrator is an artist in New York who is visited by an artist who lives in a Hungarian forest. As he leaves her apartment, he says: \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you can live here, and be an artist, amongst all this social noise and all of these people.\u201d The exchange sends the narrator into a \u201cfrenzy of self-hatred\u201d. She wonders if it\u2019s possible to live among the chaos of the city and be a \u201creal artist\u201d? Would a forest or even a jungle be more conducive? In its pace and its tangle of artistic and political angst, the tale is reminiscent of Olivia Laing\u2019s short novel Crudo, only less batty and self-satisfied. Smith shows she can pull the same autofiction trick and be funnier and more knowing.\n\nThe writing in Grand Union is most alive when Smith is channelling versions of herself, that is, the storyteller (The Canker; Blocked), the teacher (Now More Than Ever), the mother (The Lazy River) or the bookish swot (Kelso Deconstructed). We find a combination of the last two in her best story, Sentimental Education, in which a harassed mum who is contemplating the menopause remembers her time at an Oxbridge college, where she and her boyfriend, Darryl, were among the few students of colour. His means of coping with the college\u2019s cloistered privileged was to bring along his schoolfriend Leon, a cheerful, tracksuited petty criminal who dossed on his floor, charming his way into the affections of everyone from the cleaners to the posh totty.\n\nIt\u2019s an intriguing tale of education, class, betrayal and sexual chemistry in which the female protagonist reflects on the ways in which she has objectified men: \u201cThere were people to whom you wanted to abase yourself, and people you wanted to abase; there were people you wanted to meet on a flat playing field \u2013 which was called \u2018love\u2019, for capitalism\u2019s and convenience\u2019s sake \u2013 and people you really didn\u2019t know what to do with\u2026 wealth for somebody, but not her.\u201d\n\nThis idea of inconsistency hangs over many of Smith\u2019s stories. Is consistency important? Is it even possible? She is tacitly arguing a point that she has made more explicit in essays: that it is OK to change your mind.\n\n'Identity is a pain in the arse': Zadie Smith on political correctness Read more\n\nThe inconsistency of quality is a more serious flaw. At least eight of the 19 stories in Grand Union aren\u2019t very good. Two dystopian efforts, Meet the President! (a post-apocalyptic ramble about a child\u2019s virtual reality game) and Escape from New York (inspired by the urban myth that Michael Jackson, Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando fled the city together after 9/11), are cute ideas but on the page, both dawdle along. Her more conventional, naturalistic pieces, such as Big Week and Miss Adele Amidst the Corsets, are mannered and self-conscious; she struggles to locate the drama or interest.\n\nThe best stories here are those that act as commentary on her fluctuations and doubts, that blend her criticism with the energy and verve of her fiction. Smith has always been a bit of a smartarse and when she owns that smart-arsery, she\u2019s not only incredibly funny but full of heart, wisdom and truth. At the end of Downtown, as the narrator gets ready for a night out in New York, she says: \u201cI tried on four different outfits and then just went ahead and wore them all.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Grand Union by Zadie Smith is published by Hamish Hamilton (\u00a320).
