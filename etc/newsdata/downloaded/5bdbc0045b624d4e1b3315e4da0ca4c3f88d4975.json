Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +3.01% said the exact opposite.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nJ.P. Morgan reported third-quarter profit, revenue and net interest income (NII) that beat estimates, sending the stock surging 3% and touching a record intraday high of $121.59.\n\nThe blue-chip bank\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said on the post-earnings conference call with analysts, according to a FactSet transcript, that equity underwriting results soared 22% amid a \u201cstrong\u201d performance in IPOs, boasting that the bank \u201csignificantly\u201d outperformed its peers.\n\nGoldman\u2019s also suffered from some bad stock bets, an area the bank used to excel. Revenue in equity securities plunged 40% to $662 million, which Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said was because of, to put it mildly, a \u201creduction in market value on our public investment portfolio.\u201d\n\n\u201cExpectations for Goldman Sachs this quarter were already low, but the bank failed to deliver even on these revised forecasts, stumbling in areas where rival J.P. Morgan Chase just announced far more favorable results,\u201d said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management consultant Opimas.\n\nMarenzi said most troubling was Goldman\u2019s troubles in investing and lending, which had previously frequently \u201ccarried the day\u201d in previous quarters. \u201cHere, [Goldman] uncharacteristically stumbled badly, with bets on WeWork and other unicorns turning sour,\u201d Marenzi said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Here\u2019s a look at how WeWork\u2019s $50 billion pile of office leases could unravel.\n\nMeanwhile, Citigroup Inc. C, +1.40% beat profit and revenue expectations, sending the stock up 1.4% and to a fifth straight gain, while Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +1.70% profit fell well below expectations although revenue rose more than projected to push the stock 1.7% higher.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, +8.16% was the big winner, however, as the stock soared 8.2% to pace the Dow\u2019s and S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +1.00% gainers.\n\nThe health services company\u2019s stock had slumped 10.9% during the third quarter, compared with a 1.2% rise in the Dow, amid uncertainty over the political landscape ahead of the 2020 elections and increasing competition.\n\nAfter beating profit and revenue expectations and raising its full-year revenue, however, the shares headed toward the biggest one-day percentage gain in 8\u00bd years, and the biggest price gain since the company went public 35 years ago.\n\nAlso in the health-care sector, Dow component Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.62% impressed, as the stock rallied 1.6% after earnings rose more than expected. Total revenue also beat forecasts, as consumer, pharmaceutical and medical devices results all beat.\n\nAnd like its blue-chip peer UnitedHealth, J&J also raised its full-year earnings guidance.\n\nMeanwhile, the unofficial start of earnings season hasn\u2019t changed the outlook for the earnings recession that started in the second quarter to continue into the third. S&P 500 EPS is projected to decline 5.0% from a year ago, according to FactSet, compared with expectations of a 0.6% decline as of the start of the third quarter.\n\nUnited Airlines raises 2019 guidance\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, +1.05% reported third-quarter earnings after the closing bell and shares rose more than 1% after the airline raised its guidance for the year and posted an adjusted profit above Wall Street expectations. The company added that it was \u201cahead of pace\u201d to reach its goal of an adjusted EPS between $11 and $13 for 2020.\n\nJ.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. JBHT, +1.84% and Interactive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR, +0.85% , the other two major companies in the after-hours earnings lineup, saw their shares head lower, however. Interactive Brokers reported quarterly per-share earnings in line with expectations, while per-share profit at J.B. Hunt rose but not as much as Wall Street analysts forecast.", "description": "The kick-off of earnings season Tuesday was a tale of both winners and losers on Wall Street as a number of blue-chip companies reported both profit and...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HB534_goldma_ZG_20190108094623.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
