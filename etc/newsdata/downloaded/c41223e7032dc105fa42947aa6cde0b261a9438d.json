During that time, they used death threats to get information and were heavily compensated by law enforcement agencies, including the district attorney\u2019s office and sheriff\u2019s department in Orange County, California. They were paid $335,000 and got, among other things, an Xbox and leniency on charges as compensation.\n\nCuevas and Paredes are representative of the kind of informants Orange County has worked with for more than 30 years to extract information and confessions from jailed defendants, according to an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit. They were used in more than 300 undercover operations.\n\nProsecutors used informants to do what would have been illegal for them to do directly \u2014 question individuals awaiting trial without their lawyer present and, even worse, use threats of murder and violence to coerce confessions.\n\nThe Orange County district attorney's office used that information in court without disclosing how it was obtained.\n\nThese practices fly in the face of the fundamental duty of prosecutors: to seek truth and pursue justice.\n\nUnfortunately, Orange County is not unique. High-profile scandals regarding prosecutors and law enforcement illegally using informants have erupted in Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, Milwaukee and Spokane. In each place, prosecutors were burying evidence of illegal and disturbing practices, causing open cases to unravel and closed ones to be reopened. In some instances, law enforcement fed information to informants and coerced false testimony on the stand.\n\nAll over the country, defendants' constitutional right to a fair trial is being trampled. As a result, innocent people are going to prison. Some are going to death row.\n\nThe ACLU has appealed a ruling that blocked their challenge to the decades-old Orange County jailhouse informant program. The lawsuit seeks to spotlight law enforcement and prosecutorial conduct, including unethical and illegal activity that's still being investigated.\n\nPOLICING THE USA:A look at race, justice, media\n\nDespite the California court of appeals decision finding systemic misconduct and recusing the district attorney from the criminal case that uncovered the scandal, there has been no full accountability.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, the California Department of Justice, and the sheriff\u2019s and district attorney's offices have all conducted some form of investigation, but none has ordered a halt to the troubling jailhouse informant program, nor have they held those involved accountable or publicly disclosed the full scope of the problem. The California attorney general's investigation is now closed; other investigations have been ongoing for four years since the informant scandal was first uncovered.\n\nAs the gatekeepers of information, prosecutors have constitutional and ethical obligations to turn over evidence establishing conflicts of interest. When they fail to do so, the system breaks down. Significantly, according to the Innocence Project, testimony from informants has played a role in nearly 1 in 5 convictions later exonerated based on DNA.\n\nLaw enforcement can prey upon jailhouse informants\u2019 poverty, fear and desire for freedom. This coercive pressure, coupled with the inherent conflict of interest of compensation, casts doubt on the reliability of their testimony. Further, it threatens to subvert justice, especially when defendants are denied critical information needed to challenge the informant through cross-examination and help juries assess the impact of the evidence.\n\nThere are good reasons to question the ongoing propriety of jailhouse informant programs. If the immorality of sending innocent people to prison is not enough to propel reform, these programs also cost taxpayers millions of dollars. Restitution and statutory compensation from informant scandals have already topped $290 million to date. With more scandals being revealed, we can only imagine what is on the horizon.\n\nMany states, including California, have adopted some legislative restrictions on the way informants are used.\n\nBut reforms should include not simply a fresh look at the use of jailhouse informant programs, but also requirements that prosecutors immediately and fully disclose any incentives offered or expected, including payments, immunity or reduced sentences (which the ACLU seeks in its lawsuit); pretrial reliability hearings to screen fabricators early; and conviction integrity reviews that revisit troublesome jailhouse informant cases (something the new Orange County district attorney appears to have implemented).\n\nAt the same time, there is a simpler solution to work toward: good old-fashioned investigation and community trust-building. Instead of paying or coercing individuals in custody to help build a case, police and prosecutors should engage with their communities, build legitimate relationships with victims and witnesses, uncover the facts and follow them wherever they lead \u2014 even if that means dropping a case against someone whose guilt is cast in doubt by subsequent investigation.\n\nHopefully, the Orange County debacle will remind prosecutors and police that their charge is, at all times, the pursuit of justice. Our justice system and community deserve no less.\n\nMiriam Aroni Krinsky is a former federal prosecutor and the executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution, a national network of elected prosecutors working toward commonsense, compassionate criminal justice reforms.\n\nRonal Serpas is the former superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department, and former chief of police in Nashville and of the Washington State Police.
