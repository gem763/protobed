I think Leicester will finish above United, and I believe they will finish in the top four.\n\n\u2018Rodgers has proved his near-miss with the title at Liverpool in 2014 was no flash in the pan, and he would have completed the \u2018Treble Treble\u2019 at Celtic if he had stayed to the end of last season.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018In short, he is the real deal as a manager.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I repeat: I am not advocating that Solskjaer is removed from his job at Old Trafford. He deserves to be given more scope to rebuild that squad.\n\n\u2018But when the time is right, and United are looking for their next manager to play fluent, progressive football, Rodgers \u2013 not Mauricio Pochettino \u2013 would be my pick.\u2019\n\nManchester United travel to St James\u2019 Park to face Newcastle on Sunday, while Rodgers\u2019 Leicester visit Premier League leaders Liverpool this weekend.\n\nMORE: Unai Emery responds to criticism from Arsenal fans over Granit Xhaka captaincy decision", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer deserves more time to turn things around at Manchester United but Brendan Rodgers is the natural candidate to become the club's next manager.
