But that\u2019s ancient history today, and the party has also scratched up some big wins: The individual mandate is dead, the system is about as stable as it\u2019s ever been, and various executive actions have freed Americans to buy non-Obamacare plans if they want to. Amid all the chaos and ineptitude, the GOP somehow managed to keep what was popular about the law while eliminating the worst bits.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the Democratic candidates are touting expensive, disruptive ideas such as Medicare for All. Especially if the more moderate Joe Biden doesn\u2019t win the nomination, Republicans could have a field day with this. Voters want stability in health care: When Obamacare was passed, it was unpopular \u2014 but it gained popularity when Republicans went after it. It\u2019s not hard to see what happens when Democrats don\u2019t just want to reform and beef up the individual market, but are directly attacking employer-based health care.\n\nSo why is the Fifth Circuit, at the behest of several red states and with considerable support from the Trump administration itself, entertaining yet another lawsuit to strike Obamacare down?", "description": "", "authors": ["Robert Verbruggen", "Nationalreview.Com Gop-Health-Care-Conundrum-Court-Decisions-Threaten-Individual-Market-Chaos"], "top_image": ""}
