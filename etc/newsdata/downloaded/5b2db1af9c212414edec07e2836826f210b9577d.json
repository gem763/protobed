And there were moments in Thursday night\u2019s debate when he looked the part.\n\nStanding between a pair of liberal senators offering radical change, he unabashedly embraced his more moderate position on health care, forcefully pressuring Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to level with Americans about the steep cost of implementing a fully government-run system. He was more polished and practiced than in previous contests. And he repeatedly leaned on the legacy of former President Barack Obama, who remains the most popular Democrat in the nation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for Barack \u2014 I think the Obamacare worked,\u201d he declared.\n\nBut the debate was punctuated by moments that highlighted why Biden can\u2019t shake questions about his consistency and whispers about his fitness for office, despite his lead in most national polls and early state surveys. Most glaringly: a meandering answer near the end of the debate about his past statements on racial inequality. Biden said poor parents should play the \u201crecord player\u201d for their children before veering off into comments about Venezuela.\n\nBiden\u2019s standing in the Democratic contest is the source of much debate within the party. Is he an experienced elder statesman who can calm an anxious nation and peel back some of the white working class voters who helped send President Donald Trump to the White House? Or is the 76-year-old past his prime and out of step with a party that is growing younger, more diverse and more liberal?\n\nThursday night\u2019s contest provided fresh fodder for each of those theories.\n\nBiden was at his best in his lengthy exchange with Sanders and Warren over the future of health care in America. He confidently pressed them over the cost of their sweeping \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposals, exposing Warren\u2019s unwillingness to say whether middle class Americans would see a tax increase under her plan (Sanders says they would, but argues the rise would be offset by lower health care costs).\n\nIn a retort to Sanders, who has said he expects employers would pass on health care savings to their workers, Biden exclaimed: \u201cFor a socialist you\u2019ve got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.\u201d\n\nBiden was the focus of fierce criticism from his rivals in both of the previous Democratic debates. But those attacks did little to diminish Biden\u2019s standing atop polls, nor has a series of verbal flubs and misstatements throughout the summer.\n\nThe other reality: The candidates who have launched the sharpest attacks on Biden have gained little ground or already dropped out of the race. Sen. Kamala Harris, for example, bested Biden in the opening debate with a highly personal critique over his decades-old position on federally mandated school busing, but any boost for her candidacy was short-lived.\n\nPerhaps mindful of that reality, most candidates sidestepped overt criticism of the vice president in Thursday\u2019s debate.\n\nThe one notable exception was Juli\u00e1n Castro, who served as Obama\u2019s housing secretary and is in need of a jolt to break out of the lower tier of candidates. In a highly charged moment, Castro challenged Biden\u2019s memory \u2014 a barely veiled reference to questions about the former vice president\u2019s age.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting already what you just said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro said during an exchange on health care.\n\nIn a post-debate interview, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker laid into Biden as well, saying there were many people concerned about Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball \u201cacross the end line without fumbling.\u201d\n\nCastro and Booker were zeroing in on real questions that are being asked about Biden. Is he too old to serve as president? If he were the nominee, would he make a mistake at a critical moment that could clear the way for Trump?\n\nBiden\u2019s stumbles later in the debate magnified those questions. He struggled through an answer about the war in Iraq and gave a grab-bag answer to a question about how to repair the legacy of slavery in America. He appeared to suggest that poorer families needed help learning how to raise their children.\n\nBiden\u2019s supporters argue that ultimately, those answers \u2014 and the questions they raise \u2014 matter less to voters than their overall impressions of the former vice president. Indeed, there is a deep reservoir of goodwill for Biden in the Democratic Party, shaped in large part by the eight years he served as Obama\u2019s No. 2.\n\nWhich leaves little doubt as to why Biden spent much of the debate reminding Americans about those years, urging them to see him as the rightful heir to legacy of the last Democrat to occupy the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years \u2014 good, bad, indifferent,\u201d Biden said.", "description": "Biden can't seem to shake questions about his consistency and whispers about his fitness for office.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7b992d230000e90352c60f.jpeg?cache=irkzsnhlhg&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
