Justin Turner, who is 34, tied a career high with his 27th homer.\n\n\u201cBaseball doesn\u2019t discriminate age,\u201d Martin said. \u201cYou can be a good player and be young, and you can be a good player and be a little bit older, and this team fortunately has both.\u201d\n\nThe three homers pushed the Dodgers\u2019 season total to 248. They slugged seven homers - one off their season high - in beating the Rockies 16-9 Monday.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like we needed every bit of it,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.\n\nThe Rockies lost their eighth in a row overall, tying a season-long skid, and dropped their 12th in 13 games.\n\nCaleb Ferguson (1-1) got the victory with two strikeouts in one inning of relief.\n\nColorado led 2-0 on solo homers by Daniel Murphy in the second and Nolan Arenado in the fourth. Arenado\u2019s 38th homer was his fourth in his last six games at Dodger Stadium.\n\nRockies starter Chi Chi Gonz\u00e1lez took a two-hit shutout into the seventh. The Dodgers advanced just one runner to second base until that inning.\n\n\u201cToday was a grind,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWe persevered. It was good to steal one from those guys.\u201d\n\nCody Bellinger drew a leadoff walk against Gonz\u00e1lez before A.J. Pollock took a called third strike. Matt Beaty singled sharply to right field and Bellinger rounded second, nearly getting caught too far off the bag, but Ryan McMahon failed to get the tag down in time on Charlie Blackmon\u2019s throw.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez was replaced by Bryan Shaw (2-2), who retired Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez on a fly out. Martin followed and launched a 2-2 pitch into left field, giving the Dodgers their first lead of the game.\n\n\u201cHe still has that pulse,\u201d Roberts said of Martin. \u201cOne of the biggest hits of the year for us.\u201d\n\nFreese\u2019s solo shot made it 4-2.\n\nTurner\u2019s solo shot into the lower left-field seats in the eighth extended the Dodgers\u2019 lead to 5-2.\n\nCloser Kenley Jansen survived another shaky ninth to earn his 28th save. He walked McMahon with one out before pinch-hitter Yonder Alonso doubled to center. Pinch-runner Yonathan Daza scored on Tony Wolters\u2019 groundout to second, making it 5-3. Raimel Tapia grounded out to first with a runner on third for the final out.\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t have that walk,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t command the baseball like you\u2019re expected to it\u2019s hard to put guys away.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies had the potential tying runs on first and third via singles by Blackmon and Arenado in the eighth, but Casey Sadler induced a fly out to center by Murphy to end the inning.\n\nJulio Ur\u00edas made his first appearance for the Dodgers since Aug. 16 after serving a 20-game suspension for a domestic violence allegation in May. He wasn\u2019t charged in the incident, but was punished by MLB. The left-hander allowed one run and two hits in three innings of a spot start. Ur\u00edas struck out three and walked none.\n\n\u201cJulio is a guy we\u2019re counting on and he looked sharp,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez gave up two runs and three hits in a season-high 6 1/3 innings. He struck out three and walked three on 101 pitches, a season high. The Rockies lost all of his first eight starts this season.\n\n\u201cI executed every pitch and only made a few minor mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like it was a good outing and it will help my confidence.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nDodgers: OF Joc Pederson wasn\u2019t in the lineup but was available off the bench after sustaining an abdominal contusion from crashing into the lower wall in right field making a catch a night earlier. \u2026 INF Max Muncy (right wrist fracture) took ground balls and will be swinging the bat soon. \u2026 RHP Dustin May will face hitters Wednesday. He was struck on the right side of his head by a liner in Arizona last weekend. \u2026 C Austin Barnes will rejoin the team Friday after being sent down to Triple-A Oklahoma City.\n\nDE-LUX\n\nRookie Gavin Lux went 1 for 4 in his second big league game for the Dodgers. He had two hits, including a single on the first pitch of his first MLB at-bat a night earlier. \u201cHe looks like he belongs,\u201d Martin said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: RHP Antonio Senzatela (8-9, 6.95 ERA) hasn\u2019t won since July 14. He\u2019s making his third start since returning from Triple-A on Aug. 25.\n\nDodgers: LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu (12-5, 2.35) is enduring his toughest stretch of the season. He\u2019s 0-3 with an 11.05 ERA over his last three starts, having allowed five of his 15 homers in that span.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The older guys can still slug.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Beth Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/rockies_dodgers_baseball_41090_c0-150-2348-1519_s1770x1032.jpg?1d5af4980245be7213eb8462865cdaf9dd1f99e6"}
