There were simply too many injuries and one athlete who ran the sixth quickest 1500m time in history while towing an enormous cloud.\n\nThat being Sifan Hassan of Holland and that cloud being Alberto Salazar, her coach up until Monday when he was launched out of the sport for being guilty of doping offences.\n\nHassan ran 3:51.95, which is the fastest ever run at a World Championships, and her gold completed a remarkable, unprecedented double here of titles at 10,000m and 1500m.\n\nBritain's Laura Muir produced a gutsy display in the 1500m final in Doha on Saturday\n\nShe has always denied any wrongdoing and pointed this week to joining the Nike Oregon Project after the period that was under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency, but she will have to live with her choices and whatever they might mean for her public standing.\n\nNot that those considerations will serve as comfort to Muir. Her time of 3:55.76 was exceptional, only a fraction outside her personal best, and in relation to her broken preparations it was quite something. She missed six weeks of track running because of a calf injury in July and shortly before the race it was disclosed to the Mail on Sunday that she had also battled a knee injury last week and a stomach bug the week before.\n\nIn those circumstances, it was a fine run, and yet a further disappointment for the European champion, who finished fourth at London 2017. With a cleaner bill of health she would have been a contender, though surely not in the reckoning for gold. To understand Hassan's time, it is worth noting the five quicker are divided between Genzebe Dibaba, who was coached by the wanted doper Jama Aden, and four Chinese athletes in the Nineties.\n\nMuir, who joined Hassan at the front at the bell but was burnt off in the final 250m, said: 'There is a cloud - there is no avoiding that.'\n\nSifan Hassan took victory in a championship record time of three minutes 51.95 seconds\n\nOf her performance, she added: 'To run 3:55, especially when I missed so much training, I am speechless but so proud of myself.\n\n'I couldn't ask any more than that for myself. If I can run that sort of time, off the amount of training I have done, then If I am 100 per cent fit, I will be so confident going into next year.'\n\nDefending champion Faith Kipyegong took silver and Gudaf Tsegay claimed bronze.\n\nIn the wake of victory, Hassan was furious with the insinuations about her that have followed Salazar's four-year ban.\n\nShe said: 'I with I was so angry at the world. I am clean and I'm showing everyone how clean I am.'", "description": "RIATH AL-SAMARRAI IN DOHA: In the end it was all too much for Muir.
