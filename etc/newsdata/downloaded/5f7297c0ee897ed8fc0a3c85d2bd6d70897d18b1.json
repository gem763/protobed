Now, Pilgrim\u2019s son, Ken Pilgrim, is bringing the Pittsburg, Texas, home to auction without reserve on Oct. 15 with Concierge Auctions. It\u2019s the first time the house has even been for sale.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis estate was custom-built to my father\u2019s exact specifications with superior materials and craftsmanship, and our family has enjoyed it for many years,\u201d Mr. Pilgrim, 61, said in a news release.\n\n\n\nListing photos show the French-style mansion tucked behind a gated driveway. Locally referred to as \u201cCluckingham Palace,\u201d according to The New York Times, the six-bedroom, 10.5-bathroom house sits on 43 acres of manicured gardens, including three ponds, streams, a deep water well with drinking water and gardens of various trees and azalea bushes.\n\n\n\nInside, listing photos show an ornate, double-height foyer decorated with gilded details that also run throughout the living rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms and indoor pool area. Beside the indoor pool is a bar, a seating area and a hot tub. The house also features a spa, a wet and dry sauna, a fitness center, a home theater, and a glass elevator that overlooks the grounds.\n\n\n\nMore: Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas Buy and Sell in the New York Suburbs\n\nLonnie \u201cBo\u201d Pilgrim co-founded Pilgrim\u2019s Pride with his brother, Aubrey, as a small feed store in Pittsburg in 1946. He took over as CEO upon Aubrey\u2019s death in 1966 and oversaw the company as it garnered a national reputation for producing high quality chicken, turkey and eggs, as well as through bankruptcy, product recalls, animal cruelty allegations and a political scandal involving the Texas Senate. Pilgrim passed away in 2017 at age 89.\n\n\n\nThe house was listed Tuesday for $8.95 million with Clayton Pilgrim, the grandson of Bo and nephew of seller Ken, and a listing agent from Century 21 Harvey Properties, according to listing records. Clayton Pilgrim, along with Sanders Avrea and Kyle Crews of Allie Beth Allman & Associates and Matt Kreston of Concierge Auctions are marketing the property.\n\n\n\nMr. Crews said in a news release that he suggested that Mr. Pilgrim go straight to auction in order to attract the necessary global attention to sell the house within his preferred time frame.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Gagosian Highlights Zao Wou-Ki\u2019s Friendship with I.M.
