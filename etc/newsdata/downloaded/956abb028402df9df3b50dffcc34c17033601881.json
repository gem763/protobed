But ahead of their Premier League clash at Old Trafford this afternoon, their current positions could not be more different.\n\nThe hosts, who have two more titles than their rivals, are just two points from the relegation zone and coach Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is under mounting pressure to produce results \u2013 starting with this afternoon\u2019s game.\n\nLiverpool, on the other hand, are riding the wave of success, continuing from where they left off last season, when they won the Champions League and finished second in the Premier League with the highest ever points total for a non-champion.\n\nGoing into matchday nine, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team had an eight-points lead after winning their opening eight games and will remain at the top of the table irrespective of the outcome of today\u2019s game.\n\nLiverpool players are taking nothing for granted though, with Scotland captain Andy Robertson saying that they should not underestimate United, irrespective of their current league position.\n\nI have no doubt that they\u2019ll produce a reaction after a poor performance against Newcastle Scotland captain Andy Robertson\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that they\u2019ll produce a reaction after a poor performance against Newcastle. I\u2019m absolutely sure that they will be firing and wanting to kick-start their season.\n\n\u201cFor them, there would be no better time to do it, than against us. But we have our own objectives and our own aims. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to be striving for.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it matters what your form is like in these games. It doesn\u2019t matter that we\u2019ve won eight on the bounce and they\u2019re struggling. It\u2019s Man United vs Liverpool. It will be a one-off game and we\u2019ll see who comes out on top,\u201d said the left back who has played in every minute of Liverpool\u2019s Premier League campaign so far.\n\nRobertson added that he thought the rivalry between the two teams was so special because it was historic. There have been such great battles down the years.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve always had top teams that have always fought against each other for everything on the pitch. There was some good news for Klopp ahead of the game as defender Joel Matip has declared himself fit for the game after missing the last two fixtures.\n\nGoalkeeper Alisson Becker is also back in contention after having to sit out more than two months with a calf injury.\n\nMohamed Salah, who had to leave the field against Leicester after twisting his ankle, should also be available.\n\nBut if Klopp can relax, the same can certainly not be said of Solskj\u00e6r, who not only has to deal with media reports speculating that United are in negotiations with former Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri, who is said to be waiting on the sidelines for Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s dismissal.\n\nThe United coach will also go into the crunch match with a host of injuries ruling out key players.\n\nStriker Paul Pogba has been ruled out, while there is a question mark over the availability of goalkeeper David de Gea, who had to be substituted while playing for Spain during the international break.\n\nSpeaking to reporters this week Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cDavid needs a scan. I think he\u2019ll be out. It certainly looked like it anyway.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s one of those things. Paul had a scan after the Arsenal game [at the end of last month] and maybe needed a few weeks\u2019 rest in a boot so hopefully he won\u2019t be too long, but he won\u2019t make this game, no,\u201d the coach said. The Norwegian could also be without Anthony Martial, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Jesse Lingard, while Luke Shaw and Eric Bailly have been ruled out. \u201cOnce we get them back fit, I think we\u2019ll look a stronger team again,\u201d he said.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r said that despite the lack of results, he had not been disappointed in the youngsters who had been thrown in the deep end.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy with the young boys.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve stepped in during difficult circumstances, at a difficult time with loads of injuries to key players.\n\nBut I feel they\u2019ve held their own.\u201d", "description": "United coach under a lot of pressure to arrest the decline after a poor run that has left the Red Devils in 12th position, two points above relegation.", "authors": ["Peter Auf Der Heyde"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9371/8eb313f7281c4ac39352783afbcceaf6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
