Or you could start on the street level, on the group of people dancing, or a woman holding the perfect angle for a selfie.\n\nNo matter where you start on The Chronicles of New York City, a nearly 21 by 32ft mural housed at the Brooklyn Museum it\u2019s easy to get a different reading of the mural each time. There are 1,128 faces looking up, down, straight ahead or turned away. One thousand, one hundred twenty-eight distinct New Yorkers, each with their own story and relationship to the city.\n\nAnd in The Chronicles of New York City, created by the acclaimed artist JR, all 1,128 people that make up the mural get to tell their story \u2013 there\u2019s life beyond their images. JR wanted to take the mural form a step further \u2013 to be able to hear from the subjects themselves. \u201cI wish you could click on a painting at the Louvre or in Mexico and hear what the people had to say. Imagine!\u201d he told the Guardian. Here, you can do just that. For each person in the Chronicles of New York City, there\u2019s accompanying audio, housed in an app, in which they tell their story, be it their to-do list for one day in mid-2018 or their life\u2019s journey.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Artwork by JR.

The Chronicles of San Francisco, a mural preceding New York\u2019s, includes over 1,200 people. Chronicles of New York City translates the same process to the US\u2019s largest city, where JR has lived for the past nine years.\n\nThe photography shoots for Chronicles occurred over six weeks in May and June 2018. JR and his team of 15 people drove their mobile studio, housed in a tractor-trailer, through all five boroughs of New York City, approaching potential subjects on the street. Soliciting participants was \u201ccompletely random \u2013 there\u2019s no selection or casting, audition,\u201d JR said.\n\nOnce they\u2019ve agreed to a photo, it\u2019s essential to the spirit of the project that each subject make it into the final mural. \u201cI have to do everything I can to make sure that the photo and the video and the audio will be good enough to make it into a mural so that no one is left behind,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s important. People come, and they know they\u2019ll find themselves in the museum.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ll find themselves photographed, according to JR, in the position of their choosing; the photoshoots are not so much staged as giving a stage to each person\u2019s whim. Each subject is encouraged to act spontaneously, in a way that best encapsulates who they are or what they would normally be doing. Hence the mural\u2019s dynamism, in which people dance, play the saxophone, check their phone, or stare ahead, seemingly unposed.\n\nThe photos are printed on-site, the figure then cut out around the body so JR and his team can arrange them in small \u201csketches\u201d \u2013 pinned arrangementson a bulletin-board size scale. (These sketches, as well as smaller \u201clight box\u201d mini-murals and a behind-the-scenes short film, are now on exhibition as The Chronicles of New York City - Sketches at the Perrotin gallery in Manhattan \u2013 which acts as a complement to the mural exhibit.) From this bulletin-sized model, JR can begin envisioning the mural at large, arranging and rearranging cut-outs first in print, then digitally, to achieve the larger tableau.\n\nThe interviews are similar to the photography, open to individual interpretation. They are \u201cnot interviews \u2013 that is really important\u201d, JR gently corrected me when I ask about his method. \u201cWe tell the people: \u2018Whatever you record here, will stay forever, embedded in the mural. Don\u2019t think of the Brooklyn Museum, don\u2019t think of next year, don\u2019t think of today. Think of your grandchildren [who] might hear this one day. What do you want to say?\u201d\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Artwork by JR.

Some define themselves \u2013 dentist, football coach, parent, teacher, cop, firefighter, New York native Robert De Niro (presumably not found at random on the street). Others react more to the moment and talk about their day, what they\u2019re up to, where they\u2019re going.\n\n\u201cMy base is that I want people to go there physically and hear a story together,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then I\u2019m always surprised at what might happen.\u201d I ask: like the miracles of what could happen when you bring people together, when you meet someone new with whom you share a space but no connection? He shrugs, already taking that as a given.\n\n\u201cWell of course magical things happen all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s common sense.\u201d\n\nJR: Chronicles open 4 October 2019 at the Brooklyn Museum\n\nThe Chronicles of New York City - Sketches runs until 26 October 2019 at Perrotin.", "description": "For each person in the Chronicles of New York City, the artist\u2019s new work at the Brooklyn Museum, there\u2019s accompanying audio in which they tell their story", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/208f6ab251a6541568d256bba2773dec24dfdddc/345_0_4879_2929/master/4879.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=beb51c8dc84a80cb76ac598c421dd280", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
