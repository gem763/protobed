A Voice of America report revealed Turkey to be the \u201cmost prolific abuser\u201d of the Interpol Red Notice system, which requests that its members arrest any individual with a notice to their name and extradite them to the requesting country.\n\nKanter is a member of Hizmet, an Islamic movement led by Pennsylvania-based cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen, who Erdogan claims was responsible for the failed coup against him in 2016. The 78-year-old religious leader, a former Erdogan ally, denies involvement in the coup.\n\nAccording to Nordic Monitor journalist Levent Kenez \u2013 former editor-in-chief of the banned Turkish journal Meydan \u2013 Kanter\u2019s name came up in the trial of Murat G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc, a former specialist at Turkey\u2019s Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BDDK) arrested in the aftermath of the 2016 coup for \u201cillegal investigations\u201d into corrupt practices in Erdogan\u2019s government, according to the pro-Erdogan newspaper Sabah. Like nearly everyone rounded up following the coup, G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc is being tried on \u201cterrorism\u201d charges and accused of being a member of Hizmet, which Erdogan\u2019s government refers to as the \u201cFethullahist Terrorist Organization\u201d (FETO).\n\nAmong the evidence prosecutors used to accuse G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc of terrorism was following Kanter on Twitter and the appearance of two news articles about Kanter in his internet history. Anadolu Agency, the Turkish state-run government, regularly publishes news articles about Kanter \u2013 including positive ones prior to the 2016 failed coup. As Kanter is a \u201cterrorist,\u201d prosecutors argued, the Twitter follow linked G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc to \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe extraordinary document shows that prosecutors were unable to find anything illegal concerning G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc and the graft probe and therefore pursued absurd pretexts for prosecuting him by inventing new crimes that have no basis in law,\u201d Kenez wrote.\n\nKanter \u2013 who has remained outspoken against Erdogan despite his regime arresting Mehmet Kanter, his father, and sentencing him to 15 years in prison \u2013 reacted to the Nordic Monitor report with dismay on Twitter.\n\nUnbelievable!! This is just sad. I\u2019m speechless. I really don\u2019t know what to say. \u2013 Nothing Good Comes Easy. https://t.co/u1CHX8iszV \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 23, 2019\n\nKanter\u2019s father is currently embroiled in another legal proceeding, this time reportedly facing ten years in prison for ties to \u201cterrorism,\u201d with his son the only evidence against him\n\nErdogan\u2019s police have detained over 110,000 people for \u201cGulenist\u201d ties since the 2016 coup, firing thousands of others from government jobs and forcing many into exile. The legal proceedings used against suspected Gulenists are often secretive, but the little that the Turkish government reveals indicates a complete lack of due process or serious legal administration of justice. Andrew Brunson, an American Evangelical pastor arrested in 2016 for, among other things, being a \u201cGulenist,\u201d told Breitbart News this week that, of the 30 or so individuals he shared a prison cell with during his two years in captivity, \u201cnot a single one of them was involved with anything to do with the coup.\u201d Brunson shared prison cells only with other \u201cGulenists,\u201d many who had no ties to the Hizmet movement at all, much less to the alleged political conspiracy.\n\nBrunson escaped prison after President Donald Trump imposed harsh economic sanctions on Turkey for its violation of a U.S. citizen\u2019s human rights. He stood accused of being a \u201cGulenist,\u201d a supporter of the Marxist Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), and of \u201cChristianization.\u201d Like the G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc case, Turkish prosecutors used a haphazard collection of weak links and unsubstantiated claims to accuse Brunson of terrorism.\n\nTurkish government media openly refer to Kanter, a center for the Boston Celtics, as a \u201cterrorist,\u201d without providing any evidence that he has engaged in violent behavior.\n\n\u201cEnes Kanter clearly supports the head of terrorist organization. l won\u2019t send any messages to the supporters of terrorist organizations,\u201d Hidayet Turkoglu, head of the Turkish Basketball Federation, said in September.\n\nThe government-run Anadolu news agency, which printed Turkoglu\u2019s comments, also accused Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey of endorsing terrorism last week for retweeting Kanter.\n\nThe founder of Twitter took a political position against Turkey by retweeting NBA player Enes Kanter, a wanted terrorist in Turkey for his links to the Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETO),\u201d Anadolu reported.\n\nThe tweet in question listed the many ways that Erdogan has persecuted Kanter, followed by the message \u201cFREEDOM IS NOT FREE.\u201d In the context of the growing NBA controversy over Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey expressing support for anti-communist protests in Hong Kong, many interpreted Kanter\u2019s tweet as a direct response to LeBron James, who dismissed Morey as \u201cuneducated\u201d for defending democracy.\n\nKanter and James have clashed in the past; Kanter referred to James derisively as \u201cprincess\u201d in response to a perceived insult at New York Knicks rookie Frank Ntilikina in 2017, when Kanter was still on that team.\n\nKanter has continued to criticize Erdogan\u2019s government for attacking minorities in Turkey and silencing media outlets. In an appearance on CNN on Tuesday, Kanter said Erdogan \u201chas no respect for human rights\u201d and reiterated his description of the Islamist leader as \u201cthe Hitler of our century.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "A report revealed Turkey was using the fact that a former banker followed Enes Kanter on Twitter as evidence of \"terrorism.\"", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/ap-david-zalubowski-2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
