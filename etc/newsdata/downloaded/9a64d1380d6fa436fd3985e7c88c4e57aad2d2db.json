It took years but now it is in the past.\n\n\u201cIt is the same for the Djibouti national team. New players, new coach, new methodology. The mentality of the players is naive and we are working on changing that.\u201d\n\nLiberia edged Chad 1-0 in Paynesville through a Kpah Sherman goal while South Sudan beat the Seychelles 2-1 in a match moved to Sudan because the national stadium is being renovated.", "description": "Johannesburg (AFP) \u2013 Argentina-based Luis Leal scored twice as Sao Tome e Principe ended a 21-year wait for a first Africa Cup of Nations away", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/12e1cb_file-photo-sao-tome-principe-captain-luis-leal-playing-mexican-club-chiapas-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
