The ship is owned by Australian-based Aurora Expeditions and is due to be christened quayside on October 31, 2019, in Ushuaia, prior to setting sail for Antarctica. So, what makes it special?\n\n1. It has a curiously shaped bow\n\nDesigned and built for expedition cruising in the Polar regions, the 80-cabin Greg Mortimer is the first expedition ship to incorporate the patented Ulstein X-Bow. Instead of the conventional bulbous bow this one slopes the opposite way \u2013 in fact it looks a bit like the Concorde nose. The inverted bow means gentler sea crossings, faster transit speeds and reduced emissions due to a huge reduction in fuel consumption.\n\n2. How does that help passengers?\n\nThe X-Bow splits wave energy and eliminates slamming and bow impact so passengers feel fewer vibrations and less motion at sea, which should be music to the ears of those crossing the notorious Drake Passage to Antarctica.\n\n3. Who is Greg Mortimer?\n\nIn 1998 Australian explorer Greg Mortimer hatched an audacious plan to sail to Antarctica and attempt to climb Mt Minto, the highest unclimbed peak in the Admiralty Range. He had already become the first Australian to reach the summits of Mt Everest, K2 and Annapurna without the aid of supplementary oxygen. Mortimer launched Aurora Expeditions in 1991 with his wife, Margaret, following that inspirational trip to the White Continent. His contribution to mountaineering has been recognised through an Order of Australia and three Australian Geographic Society Medals.\n\n4. Will Greg be on board?\n\nIndeed. Passengers travelling on the ship\u2019s maiden voyage at the beginning of November will be lucky enough to have Mortimer as their expedition leader. Joining him is multi-award-winning nature and wildlife photographer Scott Portelli. Margaret Mortimer will christen the ship in Ushuaia, in her role as godmother.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Everything there is to know about new ice-class expedition ship Greg Mortimer, including where it will be sailing and what it will offer adventurous travellers", "authors": ["Teresa Machan", "Travel Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/Cruise/Greg-Mortimer-Aurora-Expeditions-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
