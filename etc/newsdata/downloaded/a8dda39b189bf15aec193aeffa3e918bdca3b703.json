It\u2019s hard to consider them as true Black Friday deals since they\u2019re launching in late October. Nevertheless, the deals are good, and they are likely a strong sign of what other sale prices are expected in the next few weeks.\n\nAs for what\u2019s discounted right now, we\u2019re seeing the best prices yet on the Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS + LTE, 38mm), the Xbox One S gaming console, the sixth-generation iPad, and a lot more. We\u2019ll be updating this post as new Walmart deals arrive from now until Black Friday, which kicks off on Friday, November 29th.\n\nThe best Black Friday deals from Walmart so far\n\nApple Watch Series 3 (GPS + LTE, 38mm) is $229 right now. This matches the current price at Amazon, though Walmart\u2019s deal on the Watch (pictured above) includes a free Motile 5,200mAh power bank that can wirelessly charge the smartwatch.\n\nFor context, the Series 3 that comes without cellular capability is priced at $199, so the extra $30 (plus a monthly charge from your carrier) is a small price to pay for the freedom to be able to leave your iPhone at home without missing out on messages and calls.\n\nRelated How to enable LTE cellular service on your Apple Watch\n\nThe newer Apple Watch Series 4 with GPS + LTE (44mm) connectivity costs $429 at Walmart. That\u2019s a big $200 price jump over the Series 3 listed above, but it might be worth it for several reasons: it\u2019s bigger, it\u2019s faster version with fall detection and EKG support, and it has Apple\u2019s newer design (similar to this year\u2019s Series 5 model).\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Xbox One S with 1TB of storage costs $249 and includes a copy of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare with purchase. Walmart lets you pick between a few different console bundles, each containing a different free game (like NBA 2K20, Gears of War 5, or Battlefield V) in addition to a free copy of COD.\n\nYou should know about an Xbox One S offer going on at Sam\u2019s Club during its one-day sale event taking place on Saturday, November 9th. The same console comes with a second controller (but no game) for $199, though you\u2019ll need a Sam\u2019s Club membership.\n\nApple\u2019s sixth-generation iPad with 128GB of internal storage is $299 right now. That\u2019s around $30 cheaper than we\u2019ve seen the price drop in the past, even during Black Friday last year. Compared to the latest seventh-generation iPad, this discounted model has a smaller screen (9.7 inches versus 10.2 inches), and it lacks a Smart Connector for use with Apple\u2019s Smart Keyboard. However, it contains the same A10 Fusion processor and also supports the Apple Pencil. And at $100 less, you won\u2019t have to sacrifice storage to get a good deal on an iPad.", "description": "Walmart has unveiled its early round of Black Friday deals with weeks to spare until the shopping holiday actually kicks off.
