Tonight, we broke the all-time attendance record previously held by Elton John at #SNHUArena in Manchester, New Hampshire!\u201d the US president tweeted.\n\nIn the days that followed, he repeatedly asked aides if his triumph over Sir Elton was capturing headlines. It was not.\n\nAlthough aides were not surprised as they did not view the accomplishment as a major story, to the president, it represented an emotional wound \u2014 his belief that he is perpetually demeaned and never receives his due, according to people close to him.\n\nDuring the campaign in 2016, Mr Trump would blast Sir Elton\u2019s music aboard his private aeroplane so loudly that people could not sleep, according to former campaign aides.\n\nAnd at the time, Mr Trump\u2019s advisers pointed to his public celebration of Sir Elton\u2019s civil union with his partner, David Furnish, in 2005, as evidence of his tolerance towards gay rights. (That support, expressed on Mr Trump\u2019s now-defunct blog, has been deleted, and the president\u2019s administration has established a track record of repeatedly curtailing rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, targeting transgender people in particular).\n\nStill, when the president was elected, he knew exactly whom he wanted to perform at his inauguration. He informed his friend Anthony Scaramucci that Sir Elton would play, without waiting for an actual response from the singer, according to Mr Scaramucci.\n\n\u201cThis will be the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance,\u201d Mr Scaramucci said on television at the time. \u201cElton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration.\u201d\n\nThe singer\u2019s spokeswoman, Fran Curtis, quickly made clear that that was \u201cincorrect\u201d.\n\nA day later, Sir Elton sent an email through his personal assistant to an official on the inaugural committee.\n\nAsked by The New York Times about the inauguration email from the singer, Sir Elton\u2019s husband, Furnish, initially denied it existed, saying: \u201cNo correspondence sent to President-elect Trump with an apology and no offer was ever made to perform at a UK state dinner in the US.\u201d\n\nWhen told of the details, which were provided by two people who had seen it, he quickly said it was so far back that no one immediately remembered it and provided a copy to a reporter.\n\nSir Elton has made clear since then that he wants daylight between himself and the US president\u2019s politics. Yet in the final sentences of his letter, Sir Elton suggested something of a compromise.\n\n\u201cI was honoured to perform at a White House State Dinner for the UK during the Clinton presidency and I would be delighted to do the same for you if the opportunity arises,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cI also want to wish you every success with your presidency. I love America deeply, a country that has always welcomed me and my music with kind, tolerant and open arms.\u201d\n\nSo far, no such dinner has been scheduled.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The email was cordial, warm and deferential. \u201cThank you so much for the extremely kind invitation to play at your inauguration,\u201d wrote one of Donald Trump\u2019s favourite musicians, Sir Elton John. \u201cI have given it at lot of thought, and as a British National, I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s appropriate for me to play at the inauguration of an American president.
