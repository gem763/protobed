This year, state lawmakers already have been revising the budget to factor in the additional resources, according to a recent Associated Press report.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said data points like this were part of what brought New Mexico to his attention.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese tariff fight is bringing jobs back here and oil and gas industry exploding,\u201d Parscale said. He spoke to Fox News before a \u201cVamos to Victory\u201d Latino outreach event in Los Ranchos de Albuquerque in New Mexico -- one of many they\u2019ve planned to hold in the months ahead.\n\nBut, why come to a state the president lost by eight points just four years ago? That answer may be found in the El Paso, Texas, rally the team hosted earlier this year.\n\n\u201cAt the El Paso rally, we noticed that a significant number of those who were registering were actually New Mexico voters,\u201d Trump 2020 campaign press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. \u201cWe saw 50 percent of the registrants were Democrats [and] 25 percent were swing voters. That\u2019s 75 percent who were not Republican.\u201d\n\nSeveral of those in line at the rally in Rio Rancho said they saw themselves as the \u201csilent majority\u201d in New Mexico whom Republicans finally have been recognizing. They pointed to trade, the economy and the border wall as reasons they\u2019ve remained loyal to the president.\n\n\u201cThe immigration right is now flooding New Mexico,\u201d one woman from Rio Rancho said. \u201cI work in the medical field so I see it everywhere... A lot of us New Mexicans who need the help are getting turned down \u2019cause the money has to come from somewhere.\u201d\n\nTRUMP DEMANDS RESIGNATIONS AT NY TIMES DURING NEW MEXICO RALLY\n\nMcEnany said Trump\u2019s immigration policy has been one of the biggest misunderstandings of the Hispanic electorate.\n\n\u201cIt is a complete falsehood to suggest that Hispanic voters do not care about immigration,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the contrary, Latino voters care about border security.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats, however, rejected this notion wholeheartedly, calling Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigrants \u201chateful\u201d and \u201ctoxic.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust last year, New Mexico Latinos rejected Trump\u2019s toxic agenda and broken promises by helping elect Democrats up and down the ballot in this state -- they see right through his weak attempt to court our community and are not buying it,\u201d said Democratic National Committee (DNC) Director of Hispanic Media Enrique Guti\u00e9rrez.\n\nThere is no doubt the president and his team have an uphill climb in the West. Democrats flipped New Mexico's only red House seat in 2018 and took the governor\u2019s mansion. Democrats said this trend will only continue in the upcoming election and the fact that Trump thought he could win here showed the team\u2019s desperation.\n\n\u201cWe take nothing for granted,\u201d DNC Battleground State Communications Director David Bergstein said, \u201cbut this GOP strategy looks like they\u2019re concerned about a realistic pathway to 270 electoral votes.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, Democrats apparently have been winning the battle for Hispanic voters. According to a Pew Research Center report, an estimated 69 percent of Hispanic voters voted for a Democrat in 2018 compared to 29 percent who voted for a Republican. Still, it\u2019s not a group either party could afford to forfeit.\n\nHispanics have been on track to be the largest voting minority group in 2020 with an estimated 32 million eligible to vote in 2020, according to Pew. As many as 10 percent of voters this coming cycle are expected to have been born outside the U.S.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMembers of the Trump team said, despite the skeptics, they remained committed to Hispanic voter outreach.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of skeptics,\u201d Parscale said. \u201cPennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan... There was also a lot of noise about what the president's policies would be. Now, we have policies to run on that are proving victorious for Hispanics in America.\u201d\n\nFox News' Kevin Corke and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s campaign team thinks he has a shot at winning New Mexico with a message on immigration and trade.", "authors": ["Sally Persons", "Sally Persons Is White House Producer For Fox News Channel.
