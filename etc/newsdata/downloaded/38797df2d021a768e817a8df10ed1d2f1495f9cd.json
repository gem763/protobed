Growing up in Kansas City, the famed jazz musician Milton Abel Sr. immersed his son in the vibrant world of live music, where he was exposed to dedicated artists like his father. When the younger Abel moved to New York and embarked on his dream of working in the culinary arts, it only followed that he would pursue that path with fervor.\n\n\u201cMy dad was the best at what he did,\u201d says Milton Abel II in Ben Proudfoot\u2019s short documentary That\u2019s My Jazz. \u201cSo it was important for me to carry on that legacy, and try to be a part of an elite few in whatever profession I chose.\u201d In the film, premiering on The Atlantic today, Abel reflects upon his ascension to the upper echelons of the restaurant world. After talking the celebrity chef Thomas Keller into hiring him at French Laundry, Abel went on to work at Per Se and Noma, then the best restaurant in the world. He nurtured his career as a world-class pastry chef with an ardent devotion to the craft, infusing the essence of jazz into his desserts.\n\n\u201cI was totally enamored with how his story inextricably tied music and cuisine together,\u201d Proudfoot told me. The filmmaker evokes this unique fusion with dramatic black-and-white cinematography of Abel preparing elegant desserts with the virtuosic spirit of his father\u2019s jazz.\n\nWhen Abel Sr. passed away, Abel II was forced to reevaluate his priorities. \u201cHe was able to be a professional and a father, and do them both at the highest level\u2014Hall of Fame jazz musician and Hall of Fame dad,\u201d Abel says in the film. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to be able to do both, so I had to choose what was more important to me.\u201d In the film\u2019s most emotional moments, Abel ruminates on the regrets he has about not being there for his father in his time of need. These feelings contribute to his ultimate decision to step away from the fast-paced life of an elite chef, and instead open a modest bakery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dilemma a lot of young adults face when our star is rising, just as our parents are retiring,\u201d Proudfoot said. \u201cIt\u2019s this common sunrise-sunset moment that I very much connect with.\u201d", "description": "Milton Abel II reflects on the event that led to his decision to leave the upper echelon of the restaurant world.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/09/THATSMYJAZZ_COLOR_STILLS_190410_1.7.1/video-featured.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
