How China\u2019s Giant Pig Purge Is Shaking Up the $118 Billion Pork Industry\n\n(Bloomberg) -- China\u2019s large-scale hog farms that survived the world\u2019s worst animal disease outbreak are expanding their herds, driving a recovery in sow numbers as early as next year, a pig conference heard.\n\nThe restocking of industrial-scale farms will result in a shift in hog production in the world\u2019s largest pork-consuming nation, said Qiu Huaji, head of swine infectious diseases with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences\u2019 Harbin Veterinary Research Institute. Their scale-up will lead to greater improvement in measures to protect pigs from African swine fever.\n\n\u201cThe disease will cause an industrywide shuffle, forcing breeders to boost biosecurity and accelerating the expansion of large-scale farms,\u201d Qiu told a conference on African swine fever in Zhengzhou, Henan province, attended by about 5,000 people on the weekend.\n\nThe virus, which kills most pigs in two weeks but isn\u2019t known to harm humans, has slashed China\u2019s swine herd by half since it was first reported in August last year, according to Rabobank. That\u2019s led to a massive shortfall in pork supplies that has caused domestic prices to more than double, ratcheting up the cost of meat worldwide.\n\n\u201cMany producers have exited the industry and others are reluctant to restock due to ongoing disease risk,\u201d the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in an Oct. 10 report. Still, the possibility of record profits is a strong motivation to restock and increase production, it said.\n\nMuyuan Foodstuff Co., which raises pigs and supplies livestock feed, expects to have 1.3 million sows by the end of 2019 after rebuilding its herd and expanding its animal-feed and slaughtering operations. Net income more than tripled to 1.54 billion yuan ($217 million) in the third quarter, Muyuan reported this month.\n\nThe company, based in Nanyang, Henan, has implemented measures to mitigate disease threats, Chairman Qin Yinglin told the conference. \u201cWe are confident that African swine fever virus can be eradicated on large farms in China and that a vaccine isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d he said without elaborating.\n\nEncouraging Hogs\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs released guidelines last month for the restocking of African swine fever-affected farms. The government has made expansion a priority, encouraging provincial and local authorities to set production goals and make additional land available for hog production, according to the USDA.\n\n\u201cLocal authorities have also been instructed to ease up on environmental regulations that limit where farms can be built -- a reversal of policy over the last four years that had made building new hog farms difficult or impossible in many regions,\u201d the USDA said.\n\nNew Hope Liuhe Co., which raises pigs and supplies 15 million tons of animal feed to 250,000 users annually, is trying to meet the dual needs of increasing pork supply and protecting the environment. The company, based in Chengdu, Sichuan province, aims to have the capacity to breed 25 million pigs in 2022, Chairman Liu Yonghao said last month.\n\nPig Effluent\n\nNew Hope\u2019s expansion efforts include animal waste treatment, Vice President Ji Chongxing told the conference.\n\n\u201cLarge firms are trying their best to boost their sow herds,\u201d said Lin Guofa, a senior analyst at Bric Agriculture Group. \u201cSmall ones are about to be phased out of the business as many have been left penniless after the disease.\u201d He expects the number of farms that raise more than 5,000 hogs annually could double next year.\n\nAbout half of China\u2019s 26 million pig producers raise fewer than 500 hogs each. The country\u2019s agriculture ministry detailed a plan in 2017 to ensure farms producing at least 500 hogs a year account for 52% of domestic output by 2020, versus 42% in 2014.\n\n\u201cFor big operations, the speed of recovery is very rapid\u201d once disease-control measures have been implemented, said Bao Hongxing, chairman of Twins Group Co., one of the country\u2019s major animal-feed producers.\n\nFarms raising fewer than 3,000 pigs a year have less confidence to rebuild, and those lacking the biosecurity needed to prevent disease outbreaks have difficulty gaining approval for bank loans, Bao said, adding that Twins Group is aggressively buying these farms to expand.\n\nSow-led Recovery\n\nSows, which can produce 20 or more piglets a year, are critical to boosting China\u2019s domestic pork supply. Sow numbers in September were 40% below year-earlier levels. Still, the breeding herd should rebound to pre-outbreak levels next year, Muyuan and New Hope Liuhe executives told the Zhengzhou conference.\n\nWens Foodstuffs Group Co. Ltd., the country\u2019s largest pig breeder, and COFCO Meat both said they retained their sow herd as breeding stock instead of being slaughtered for meat. Wens will accelerate its expansion to reach a targeted 70 million pigs a year, or the equivalent of 10% of the country\u2019s total number of hogs slaughtered.\n\nA 15-kilogram (33 pound) gilt, or female piglet, for breeding purposes recently fetched as much as 5,000 yuan, compared with 1,800 yuan for a piglet destined for meat production, Bric Agriculture\u2019s Lin said.\n\nChina had about 30 million before African swine fever. A rebound in sow numbers will boost pork supply in the fourth quarter of 2020 or early 2021 at the earliest, assuming no further widespread outbreaks, Lin said.\n\n\u2018Like an Enemy\u2019\n\nStill, there\u2019s no certainty of that, the Harbin institute\u2019s Qiu said.\n\n\u201cThe disease is like an enemy who may break into your house any time,\u201d said Qiu, who has studied ways to protect farms, including the protective effects of Chinese medicines.\n\nEven if pork production bounces back, it\u2019s likely consumer demand for it won\u2019t fully recover, according to John Deen, a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\u201cConsumers are so shocked by high pork prices and they may never come back to the same level as before,\u201d Deen said.\n\nDomestic pork consumption may drop by 40% to 50% as surging pork prices led restaurants to serve less pig meat, said Yan Zhicun, chief science officer with New Hope Liuhe Group.\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Niu Shuping in Beijing at nshuping@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anna Kitanaka at akitanaka@bloomberg.net, Jason Gale, Tony Jordan\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "How China\u2019s Giant\u00a0Pig Purge Is\u00a0Shaking\u00a0Up the $118 Billion Pork Industry", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEBB80A2_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
