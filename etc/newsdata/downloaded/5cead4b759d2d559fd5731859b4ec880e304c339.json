(TropicalTidbits.com/NOAA)\n\nTropical Storm Karen once looked as if it would hold together during its westward trek toward land, possibly threatening the Bahamas and Southeast United States. Now, \u201cbarely a tropical storm,\u201d Karen is predicted to dissipate entirely in three or four days, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nMeanwhile, Hurricane Lorenzo, though no threat to land, has stolen the show by rapidly intensifying to a Category 4 hurricane. And there could be more tropical activity on the horizon.\n\nKaren\n\nKaren\u2019s life as a tropical cyclone has been a tumultuous one. It formed early Sunday morning but was downgraded to a tropical depression Monday afternoon before impacting Puerto Rico as a tropical storm on Tuesday. While the system didn\u2019t produce much in the way of wind as it breezed through the island territory, up to half a foot of rain fell in spots \u2014 with radar-estimated totals topping a foot just offshore.\n\nKaren is set to make its long anticipated loop-de-loop as it reverses direction into Friday. Maximum winds were estimated at 40 mph Thursday morning, but in reality they\u2019re probably less. It\u2019s located midway between the Virgin Islands and Bermuda.\n\nOn satellite, Karen resembled more a large cluster of thunderstorm activity akin to a Great Plains-style \u201cmesoscale convective complex\u201d rather than a tropical system. The National Hurricane Center called the storm \u201cquite disheveled,\u201d referring to the messy circulation and unbalanced wind field. While a small area of tropical storm force winds exists southeast of the center, there\u2019s little else keeping Karen a tropical storm at this point.\n\n\n\nTropical Storm Karen continues to cling to life by a thread, struggling in the presence of increasing wind shear and a tattered, misaligned central vortex. (TropicalTidbits.com/NOAA)\n\nThe struggling system will likely cling to life over the next 24 hours before diminishing into a tropical depression. All the while, the storm will slow to a crawl, then reverse entirely and drift west in an increasingly unfavorable atmosphere. Strong upper-level winds will prove hostile to Karen\u2019s longevity, while pernicious dry air erodes the storm.\n\nBy early next week \u2014 if not sooner \u2014 Karen is forecast to be gone.\n\nLorenzo\n\nBut Karen is not alone. You may recall mention of Lorenzo, now a major hurricane over the open Atlantic. It was clear Lorenzo would be a formidable storm from the start; the Hurricane Center predicted it would rapidly organize even when it was a fledgling tropical wave still over Guinea and Mali in Africa.\n\nAs forecast, Lorenzo strengthened very quickly after exiting Africa\u2019s west coast and emerging in the Atlantic. On Monday morning, it was a tropical depression. By lunchtime, it became a tropical storm. Lorenzo then metastasized into a hurricane Wednesday morning with 80 mph winds; barely a day later, Lorenzo rapidly intensified into a major Category 4 hurricane with 130 mph winds. It\u2019s the third major Atlantic hurricane of the 2019 season.\n\nA storm is considered to have undergone rapid intensification when its maximum central winds spike by 35 mph or more in 24 hours.\n\nFortunately, Lorenzo isn\u2019t going to bother anyone. Instead, Lorenzo is just eye candy for meteorologists, forecast to spend the entirety of its life whirling over the open Atlantic.\n\n\n\nLorenzo has become the second farthest-east Atlantic major hurricane on record. (TropicalTidbits.com/NOAA)\n\nOn satellite, Lorenzo\u2019s appearance is striking; an eye developed just after sunrise Thursday. But its meteorological beauty may belie a clandestine climatic warning.\n\nLorenzo is the strongest hurricane this far east out of any on record in the Atlantic, save for Julia in 2010. That\u2019s according to Colorado State hurricane researcher Philip Klotzbach, who carefully maintains tropical cyclone records and statistics.\n\nEric Blake, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center, tweeted that only 10 Atlantic hurricanes had ever formed east of 40 degrees west longitude. Five of them have occurred in the last decade \u2014 which he described as \u201cprobably no coincidence.\u201d His tweet alludes to the likely connection between climate change and more rapidly intensifying storms, not to mention the expected tendency toward stronger storms overall.\n\nAfter Lorenzo reached Category 4 strength, Blake tweeted: \u201cYou won\u2019t find anything comparable in that part of the [Atlantic] basin for strength and size except for Gabrielle 1989, and that was several degrees west.\u201d\n\nVery happy that #Lorenzo is turning out to sea- that is a beastly hurricane. You won\u2019t find anything comparable in that part of the basin for strength and size except for Gabrielle 1989, and that was several degrees west. pic.twitter.com/YMeETd334n \u2014 Eric Blake \ud83c\udf00 (@EricBlake12) September 26, 2019\n\nElsewhere in the tropical Atlantic\n\nEyes also turn to the Gulf of Mexico in the coming weeks as we begin the downward slope in the back half of hurricane season. Signs point to the development of a \u201cCentral American Gyre,\u201d a large closed circulation in the middle atmosphere, in about seven to 10 days or so. It looks to set up somewhere from the western Caribbean into the Gulf.\n\nSince it is looking increasingly likely #Karen will fizzle out in the NATL, the next looming tropical threat is a large broad Central American Gyre (#CAG) that has been hinted on in the guidance in 5-7 days. Shows up in both the ECMWF & GFS.\n\n\n\nURL: https://t.co/oZ3C817p9A pic.twitter.com/gy5gI5jnBD \u2014 Philippe Papin (@pppapin) September 25, 2019\n\nWhile this in no way guarantees tropical activity, large areas of cyclonic spin can sometimes encourage borderline systems to develop, and can intensify existing ones. It\u2019s simply another feature we\u2019ll have to watch as the active hurricane season continues.", "description": "Karen is expected to dissipate into a tropical depression, but Lorenzo's leap to major hurricane strength may belie a hidden climate warning.", "authors": ["Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist", "Capital Weather Gang", "September At Pm", "Matthew Cappucci Is A Meteorologist For Capital Weather Gang.
