Preemptively addressing an issue is one way, an effective way, to keep the government from crushing your business, but it\u2019s also a way some companies are hoping to fend off further scrutiny from legislators. This week we saw two examples: one from Facebook and the other from Juul.\n\nIn one case, Facebook is pretending to be pro-free speech, and in the other, Juul is pretending to care about children. Moves by both companies are, in reality, cynical attempts to appeal to government for their own benefit.\n\nFacebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave a strong speech in favor of free speech this week. Zuckerberg ended his speech at Georgetown with, \u201cI believe in giving people a voice because, at the end of the day, I believe in people. And as long as enough of us keep fighting for this, I believe that more people\u2019s voices will eventually help us work through these issues together and write a new chapter in our history \u2014 where from all of our individual voices and perspectives, we can bring the world closer together.\u201d\n\nNice, flowery language. But does he really believe in freedom of speech on his platform, which is where he has absolute control and his opinion matters most? That\u2019s another story.\n\nFacebook, along with Twitter and YouTube (which is owned by Google), have a long track record of deplatforming conservatives. While Twitter and YouTube get a lot more press, Facebook\u2019s actions are just as bad.\n\nThere is no more calm, reasoned person on the planet than Dennis Prager. Yet Facebook declared some of his Prager University videos (short explanatory videos on issues of the day) to contain \u201chate speech\u201d and banned them. They eventually lifted the ban and apologized, but apologizing isn\u2019t the issue; committing the offense in the first place is. You don\u2019t error on the side of banning when you\u2019re truly committed to \u201cgiving people a voice.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, many conservative websites have been made and broken by Facebook changing its algorithm, which determines what people can see in their newsfeed. You\u2019d think if you liked a page or a friend shared a post from a website that is would show up, since that\u2019s what the newsfeed is supposed to be. You\u2019d be wrong. Just because you\u2019ve decided to follow someone or some website doesn\u2019t mean Facebook will automatically show you what they\u2019ve posted.\n\nFacebook drives an enormous traffic, particularly to news sites. If you fall out of favor with whatever they determine to be acceptable, you\u2019re screwed. And you could be done.\n\nA speech is good PR when there\u2019s the prospect of the government moving in the regulate your business over that very issue, but actions matter more. (Ironically, they support net neutrality, which would preemptively regulate the Internet Service Providers to protect Facebook\u2019s ability to consume as much bandwidth as it likes.)\n\nAnother company sucking up to government regulators in hopes of helping itself is Juul, the e-cigarette giant.\n\nPoliticians have declared the vaporizer market to be public enemy number one, and are scrambling to go further than others to \u201cprotect the children\u201d from the most effective smoking secession tool ever created. The Trump administration, for reasons known only to them and have nothing to do with science, are allegedly considering banning all vaping products regardless of flavor.\n\nNormally when regulators set their sights on an industry, that industry bans together to protect itself and fight back, since regulation adds costs and drives many smaller companies out of business and a ban by the Trump administration is an existential threat to the entire industry.\n\nBut Juul, the top dog in the market, is embracing government interference, openly supporting the idea.\n\nThat Juul would publicly embrace the banning of flavors under the banner of public health, even going so far as to end producing certain flavors critics say appeal to children. But if vaping is unhealthy, what does the flavor matter?\n\nIt turns out, flavor matters a lot.\n\nJuul announced they were voluntarily ending production of flavors like mango, cr\u00e8me, fruit, and cucumber. It\u2019s their choice to produce or not produce whatever flavors they want.\n\nBut they aren\u2019t doing this for magnanimous reasons. By agreeing that certain flavors should be banned, Juul is throwing its weight behind government action to officially do just that. That\u2019ll harm their smaller competitors who need every sale they can get, while protecting Juul\u2019s top sellers \u2013 mint and menthol flavors \u2013 where they dominate the market.\n\nIt\u2019s a shrewd move \u2013 if their competitors are crowded out as their specialty flavors are banned, users not wanting to return to smoking will naturally flow to the most readily available options \u2013 Juul\u2019s most popular flavors.\n\nBy the way, if Juul is supporting the banning of certain flavors out of concern of children, why aren\u2019t they concerned with the fact that the Food and Drug Administration found just last month \u201cthe overwhelming majority of youth e-cigarette users cited the use of popular fruit and menthol or mint flavors\u201d? To be exact, the FDA found 63.9 percent of high school students who used vape products used menthol or mint flavors in 2019. Again, if the idea is \u201cprotect children,\u201d why exempt the flavors that saw an increase in percentage of high school use (up from 51.2 percent in 2018) when the \u201csweet\u201d flavors, which critics say appeal to kids, decreased from 75.5 percent to 65.9 percent?\n\nBecause Juul is willing to support a ban on the option they don\u2019t dominate, just like the cigarette industry didn\u2019t mind the banning of clove cigarettes in 2009. If you can suck up to government regulators while eliminating your competition and simultaneously driving more customers to your product, you\u2019d be crazy not to. That doesn\u2019t make you any less hypocritical.\n\nNo business voluntarily embraces government action in their industry, unless they see a strategic advantage in doing so. With Facebook, they\u2019re hoping to fend off regulators by presenting themselves as already in line with stated objective. For Juul, they see an opportunity to increase their sales while eliminating competition, merging their strategy to increase their market share.\n\nNone of this would be possible were it not for government growing well beyond where it has any business being, which is the real problem. Were government limited to its constitutional duties, neither of these stories would be possible. Then again, were the federal government limited to what it\u2019s supposed to do, no company would even think of them at all.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "Whether you like them or not, a lot of big .10/20/2019 1:11:15AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Bronson Stocking", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/260/461adef4-9c24-4bee-9ed7-f00b8a28a13e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
