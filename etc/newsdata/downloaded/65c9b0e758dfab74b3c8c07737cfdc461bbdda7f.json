Second of all, there are other possible articles of impeachment to which McGahn is irrelevant.\u201d\n\nNadler\u2019s comments were notable as his committee prepares to embrace procedures that it says will help expedite Democrats\u2019 investigation of whether to bring articles of impeachment against Trump. Though the committee has been trying to collect evidence on several episodes of potential obstruction \u2014 first laid out by special counsel Robert Mueller \u2014 lawmakers are also eyeing allegations that Trump paid hush money to silence two women who have accused him of affairs, that he is using his luxury resorts to profit off his government service and that he was seeking a business deal in Russia while campaigning in 2016.\n\nMcGahn has, in many ways, been viewed as a linchpin of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s probe. He was Mueller\u2019s chief witness to allegations of obstruction by Trump, describing multiple attempts and orders by the president to constrain or fire the special counsel. But so far, McGahn has refused to cooperate with a Judiciary Committee subpoena to testify, blocked by Trump\u2019s claim that his former aide is \u201cabsolutely immune\u201d from congressional inquiry.\n\nThe matter is being litigated in U.S. District Court in Washington, a process expected to take at least two months to resolve, not counting appeals or delays.\n\nBut Nadler\u2019s comments open up the possibility that the committee could decide that it has a critical mass of evidence without McGahn\u2019s direct testimony.\n\nNadler declined to say whether he had a timetable to finish the committee\u2019s work on potential impeachment, especially given the approaching 2020 election.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it as rapidly as possible.", "description": "\"There\u2019s a lot of testimony we have without McGahn,\" Nadler said.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cd/0b/f34b93c943628f2adbaed062857d/190909-nadler-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
