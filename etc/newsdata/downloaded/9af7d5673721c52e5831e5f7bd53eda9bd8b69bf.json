Lower-polling candidates made occasional efforts to break out but were largely unable to deliver on their attempts to needle the trio of septuagenarians at center stage.\n\nBiden repeatedly claimed the mantle of President Barack Obama\u2019s de facto successor, as he did when he attacked Warren\u2019s embrace of Sanders\u2019 Medicaid for All health care plan.\n\n\u201cI know the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie but I\u2019m for Barack,\u201d Biden said, arguing for improvements to Obamacare rather than the government takeover of health insurance advocated by Sanders and Warren.\n\nThe most aggressive attempt to cut down the front-runner came from his former Obama administration colleague Julian Castro. He asserted his health care plan was better than Biden\u2019s because people who qualified would automatically be enrolled, saying that they would have to opt in to Biden\u2019s Medicare for Choice plan.\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have a buy in,\u201d Castro said.\n\nWhen Biden shot back, \u201cThey do not have to buy in,\u201d Castro pounced.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re forgetting that?\u201d\n\nBut Biden had said earlier that people who can\u2019t afford insurance would be \u201cautomatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option that we have.\u201d\n\nCastro\u2019s not-so-subtle attack on the 76-year-old Biden\u2019s memory exposed what had been a largely unspoken question in the Democratic field: whether Biden has the energy and endurance to fight a campaign against President Donald Trump.\n\nThe attack seemed to cement the idea that criticizing Biden, especially for his age, may end up hurting them more than Biden.\n\nAt that point, other Democrats made an appeal to unity. \u201cThis is why debates have become unwatchable,\u201d Pete Buttigieg said. \u201cWe\u2019re all on the same team,\u201d Andrew Yang said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president,\u201d Cory Booker said. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t lose it by the way we talk to each other.\u201d\n\nBut Biden fought on for the rest of the debate, even defying moderators who tried to cut him off toward the end. \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to go like the rest of them do, twice over, OK?\u201d\n\nDespite the occasional rancor, the Democrats also made more of an attempt to unify on two things they agreed on: praising Obama and condemning Trump.\n\nParty officials recently have been warning against criticizing the former president at risk of turning off voters and instead focus on Trump.\n\nJulian CastroCory Booker\n\nTrade Policy\n\nTrade brought a full round of criticism of the current president. The candidates who responded to questions on trade all agreed that Trump\u2019s approach to trade -- especially his erratic approach to negotiations with China -- isn\u2019t working, but didn\u2019t offer detailed solutions.\n\nBiden, Sanders and Warren all agreed that labor, farmers and environmentalists should be at the table for future trade talks.\n\n\u201cWe can use trade not to undermine American workers,\u201d farmers or small businesses but to \u201chelp build a stronger economy,\u201d Warren said, also bemoaning the role that she said corporate interests have had in recent trade talks. Over the last two decades, trade has been the fourth biggest issue for Washington lobbyists, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nSanders noted his opposition to the North American Free Trade Accord and permanent normal trade relations with China, both measures that Biden had voted for while serving in the Senate. But Biden reiterated the plan for China trade talks that he\u2019s also mentioned on the campaign trail, that the U.S. should \u201corganize the world to take on China.\u201d\n\nThe candidates clashed again over gun control. Biden has said Kamala Harris\u2019 proposal to ban assault weapons by executive order would be unconstitutional.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Joe Biden battled Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on health care in a fight emblematic of the Democratic Party\u2019s deepest schism.The struggle between the Democrats\u2019 left wing and a faction of moderates over whether to promote a sweeping government-run health care plan or to build on", "authors": ["Gregory Korte", "Jennifer Epstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ln31xqnHjx1kvDiv1dlZyg--~B/aD03NzY7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/51d671f9956602f5559ee011efbdf581", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
