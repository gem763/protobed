I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe image is thought to have been given to him as part of a morning intelligence briefing, prompting nuclear proliferation expert Joshua Pollack to tell CNBC: \u201cThis will have global repercussions\u201d.\n\nMr Pollack marvelled at the president\u2019s actions: \u201cThe utter carelessness of it all... So reckless.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is extremely unlikely that the US had anything to do with the explosion. And it\u2019s a monumentally bad idea to hint that we might have,\u201d added Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear weapons expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, California.\n\nThe United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran.
