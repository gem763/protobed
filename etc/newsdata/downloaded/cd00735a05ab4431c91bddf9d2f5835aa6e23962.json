Things got especially heated when other candidates, namely Julian Castro, joined in.\n\nThe acrimony got so great that some candidates warned that the infighting would only hurt the Democrats as they seek to oust President Donald Trump from office.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nThe issue was where the candidates stand on healthcare, as Biden proposes a plan designed to expand coverage and offer a public option, and Warren and Sanders favor a much larger Medicare for All. Stephanopoulos asked Biden whether his more progressive rivals were going \u201ctoo far\u201d in their plans.\n\nBiden tried to draw a contrast from Warren, who steadily gained in the polls over the summer.\n\n\u201cI know the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie. Well, I\u2019m for Barack,\u201d he said. He criticized Warren, saying that she has not said how she would pay for her plan. Sanders, he said, has done that, but his plan only gets \u201chalfway there.\u201d\n\nWarren and Sanders defended their approaches, and said that the country needed bolder solutions that wrest control of the healthcare system away the influence from insurance companies.\n\n\u201cI have never actually met anybody who likes their health insurance company. What they want is access to healthcare,\u201d she said.\n\nSanders noted that healthcare companies, i.e. insurance and pharmaceutical firms, would be advertising during the ABC commercial breaks.\n\n\u201cMaybe you have run into people who love their premiums. I haven\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nIn contrast to previous debates, Stephanopoulos and other moderators did not stop the back and forth between the candidates, even as they stepped up their attacks on each other. The one minute, fifteen second time limit to answer questions was barely enforced.\n\nCastro stood out in his attacks on Biden. At one point, as he was trying to contrast enrollment in his healthcare plan to Biden\u2019s, he crossed the line into a swipe about the former vice president\u2019s age.\n\n\u201cThe difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in,\u201d Castro said. And I would not require them to opt in. They would automatically be enrolled. That\u2019s a big difference.\u201d\n\nBut Biden insisted, \u201cThey do not have to buy in.\u201d\n\nCastro shot back, \u201cYou just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in\u2026Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d\n\nSome in the audience gasped and booed, and a few clapped, at Castro\u2019s dig at Biden\u2019s age.\n\nThey didn\u2019t end their tiff there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you\u2019re not,\u201d Castro said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be a surprise to him,\u201d Biden snapped back.\n\nOther candidates tried to take the high ground.\n\n\u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg. \u201cThis everybody of what they can\u2019t stand about Washington.\u201d\n\nBut Castro defended the tone. \u201cThat\u2019s called the Democratic primary election. That\u2019s called an election.\u201d\n\nAmy Klobuchar then said, \u201cA house divided cannot stand.\u201d\n\nAccording to the transcript, though, Biden did not say that people would have to buy in. He had just said that \u201cevery single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan.\u201d\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
