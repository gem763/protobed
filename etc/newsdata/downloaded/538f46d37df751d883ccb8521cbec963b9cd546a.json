A week ago, Politico\u2019s David Siders reported, \u201coutside Washington, there\u2019s creeping anxiety throughout the party [impeachment] might only help the president clinch a second term.\u201d Monday, Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett and James Arkin report that \u201cSenate Democrats are growing increasingly giddy at the prospect of seeing a half-dozen vulnerable senators squirm for weeks and months about Trump\u2019s behavior before eventually being forced to go on the record to convict or acquit Trump if he\u2019s impeached by the House.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolling now suggests most Democrats and a nonzero fraction of Republicans support an impeachment inquiry (though see FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Mark Blumenthal for a caveat). Multiple Republicans in Congress, as well as former Trump officials, are castigating the president for his behavior.\n\nThe rapidity with which all this has happened stands in stark contrast to the two-year Mueller investigation. In the words of Marvin the Martian, after the Mueller report dropped there was the distinct lack of an \u201cEarth-shattering kaboom.\u201d Some wags are even suggesting that the past week shows that Mueller was actually a bad investigator.\n\nSo it is worth asking: Why is this the scandal that will lead Trump to be impeached rather than all of his previous scandals?\n\nAD\n\nI may be just a small-town political scientist, but I reckon that there are multiple reinforcing answers to this question:\n\nAD\n\n1) This is a presidential scandal. Trump\u2019s treatment of women, his tax fraud, even the Mueller investigation primarily concerned Trump\u2019s activities prior to becoming president. The Ukraine business is entirely about his abuse of presidential power for personal gain. This is not (really) about his staff or subordinates; it\u2019s about him.\n\n2) Trump\u2019s staffers are making everything worse and not better. As the Mueller report concluded, \u201cThe President\u2019s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.\u201d It is a credit to those staffers that in refusing Trump\u2019s orders they helped stop him from, you know, committing crimes.\n\nAD\n\nThat was then, and Trump\u2019s current support staff is of lower quality. Their response to the Ukraine call was to try to cover up its contents. The whistleblower wrote that he \u201clearned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to \u2018lock down\u2019 all records of the phone call.... The transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature. One White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\"\n\nAD\n\nIn attempting to conceal information, Trump\u2019s staff has successfully added a coverup to the original scandal. This is in direct contrast to Ty Cobb\u2019s strategy of giving the Mueller investigation every document it wanted. This time around, Trump\u2019s staff is clearly off-balance.\n\n3) Trump is making everything worse. Maybe Trump believed that after the Mueller investigation he was bulletproof. This time around, however, every Trump response has been a disaster. If he thought the release of his conversation with Zelensky would put this all to rest, he was mistaken. His Twitter attacks on the whistleblower, on Adam Schiff, on anyone in the line of fire have only added another possible article of impeachment to the list.\n\nAD\n\nOne GOP congressional aide told The Post\u2019s Ashley Parker, \u201cIt\u2019s such a cliche that Trump doesn\u2019t think anyone can defend him the way he can defend himself, but they need to try, because right now it\u2019s just him tweeting about Adam B. Schiff.\u201d The aide is right.\n\nAD\n\n4) The White House\u2019s talking points stink. Jake Tapper filleted Jim Jordan. Chris Wallace vivisected Stephen Miller. Scott Pelley pantsed Kevin McCarthy. Rudy Giuliani beclowned himself multiple times. The reasons for this are unsurprising, as White House talking points cannot obscure Trump\u2019s abuse of power. Efforts to muddy the waters have not really succeeded. As Esquire\u2019s Charles Pierce correctly notes, \u201cAnd these guys are the best they\u2019ve got. Wait\u2019ll Louie Gohmert and Matt Gaetz get to center stage.\u201d NOTE: We don\u2019t have to wait.\n\nFinally...\n\nAD\n\n5) Previous Democratic reticence gives this more meaning. No one can say that Nancy Pelosi wanted to take this path. She had been the primary brake on impeachment since January. Now she is saying that pursuing impeachment would be worth losing the House in 2020. GOP partisans will dismiss her previous reluctance, but for everyone else, that switch in her rhetoric is a powerful signal.\n\nMaybe SNL is right and nothing is going to happen. But getting impeached is definitely something, and given the evidence that everyone already has, it sure seems like it is going to happen.\n\nAD", "description": "Five reasons this is far worse than the Mueller prove for Trump.", "authors": ["Daniel W.
