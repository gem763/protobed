It strenghtened slightly after Bloomberg reported Barnier saying Northern's consent was not an obstacle to a deal and that a deal was almost completed.\n\nAgainst the euro, the pound was down 0.3% at 86.63 pence , after rising on Wednesday by the same extent as against the dollar.\n\nIn less than a week, sterling had managed to gain more than 6% in value against the dollar as hopes of a Brexit deal by the end of Oct. 31 have risen.\n\nAnalysts revised up their expectations of a Brexit deal by the end of the October deadline and traders cut back their short positions on the British currency.\n\nSterling shorts were already low, the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed. In the week to Oct. 8, positions fell to $5.58 billion, the lowest in three months.\n\n\"It's difficult to see a return of a no-deal Brexit risk,\" said Lee Hardman, a currency analyst at MUFG.\n\nThe bank now attached a 60% probability to a deal, and has lowered the probability of a no-deal Brexit to 30%. If a deal is reached, MUFG sees sterling/dollar rising back to between $1.30 and $1.35, it said. In case of a no-deal, the pound would fall sharply back towards $1.20 and beyond, the bank added.\n\nThe pound was untouched by flat monthly retail sales volumes in September in Britain, as the currency was primarily driven by Brexit developments.\n\n\n\n\n\n(By Olga Cotaga, Editing by William Maclean)", "description": "The pound weakened on Thursday after Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party said it could not support a Brexit deal proposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the European Union, though it traded close to a five-month high.
