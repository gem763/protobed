Overstock said Robert Hughes, its previous principal financial officer, will serve as acting chief financial officer while the company searches for a permanent replacement. Mr. Hughes also will remain president of Overstock\u2019s Medici Land Governance Inc. unit, a blockchain-based platform.\n\nShares were down 18% to $12.21 on Monday, after the company also cut earnings guidance. Overstock announced the news before regular trading hours.\n\nOverstock, an online seller of rugs, furniture and other goods, also named Jonathan Johnson chief executive, removing the interim tag he had carried since August. Mr. Johnson took the helm at the company on an interim basis last month after Patrick Byrne, the company\u2019s founder, resigned as CEO.\n\nDuring his tenure as CEO, Mr. Byrne targeted short sellers, picked fights with journalists and spent millions of dollars on cryptocurrency projects. Last month, he announced his resignation in a letter to shareholders that alluded to a relationship with jailed Russian agent Maria Butina and covert activities on behalf of the U.S. government.\n\nMr. Iverson, who joined as CFO in April 2018 from Apollo Education Group Inc., declined to comment on why he left his role, but said Mr. Byrne\u2019s departure contributed to recent volatility at the company. \u201cOver the past few months, things have been turbulent with regard to the former CEO\u2019s dealings, among other factors,\u201d Mr. Iverson told CFO Journal. He said he is starting to look for a new CFO position.\n\nA new, permanent finance chief would need experience in developing and managing blockchain assets, analysts said, as the company shifts away from its e-commerce furniture business.\n\nOverstock said on several earnings calls it has held strategic discussions over the fate of its retail business. Mr. Byrne\u2019s exit now clears the way for the company to sell the retail business to a bricks-and-mortar player, said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co. who follows Overstock.\n\nAn Overstock spokesman didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\n\nShould the company decide to sell the retail business, the CFO position could be reshaped, focusing on several early-stage blockchain investments, said Mr. Forte. \u201cThe right CFO could help Johnson usher in a period of tranquility after the volatility of Byrne\u2019s tenure,\u201d Mr. Forte said.\n\nOverstock has posted a string of money-losing quarters over the past year. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating part of its crypto business.\n\nOverstock, which previously forecast an increase in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from its retail business in the third quarter, said actual results for the quarter to date have been roughly break-even.\n\nOverstock\u2019s previous full-year forecast of adjusted Ebitda of $17.5 million for the retail business had been based on stronger earnings in the third quarter.\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com and Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com", "description": "Overstock.com, having just named a new chief executive, is now on the hunt for a new finance chief.", "authors": ["Mark Maurer", "Colin Kellaher"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109950/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
