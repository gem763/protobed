We\u2019ve had BHS, we\u2019ve had Carillion, we\u2019ve had Patisserie Valerie and now we have Thomas Cook. How many more do we need before your industry opens its ideas and recognises that you are complicit in all of this and that you need to reform?\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe can\u2019t rely on you to do the right thing and legislation is needed. We need tougher regulation because your industry is not willing to make the changes needed. Reform is long overdue.\u201d\n\nReeves was speaking as MPs on the committee grilled bosses from PricewaterhouseCoopers and EY, which both audited Thomas Cook\u2019s accounts, and questioned them about potential conflicts of interest. Both firms also did other lucrative work for the collapsed travel company, as well as providing auditing services.\n\nMPs heard that PwC was paid \u00a321m for providing consultancy and non-audit work for Thomas Cook between 2007 and 2016, which included advising the company on pay for its executives. EY, which took over from PwC in 2017, provided non-audit services totalling \u00a32.4m.\n\nHermione Hudson, PwC\u2019s head of audit, said there are now \u201csignificant restrictions\u201d on other work that can be done by a firm\u2019s auditor. She insisted: \u201cI don\u2019t think doing those non-audit services would have impacted the quality of the audit work, but I do think it\u2019s very important that we do have a trusted audit profession.\u201d\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\n\nMPs also questioned the auditors about Thomas Cook\u2019s use of exceptional items \u2013 one-off costs \u2013 that were stripped out of the main income statement. Hudson acknowledged that \u00a31.8bn of exceptional items over eight years was \u201ca large number\u201d. Both PwC and EY said they had challenged Thomas Cook\u2019s management on the use of exceptional costs.\n\nThe auditors were also asked why the travel company carried more than \u00a31bn of goodwill \u2013 the intangible asset of an acquired company which measures things like reputation, customer base and brand value \u2013 on its balance sheet for years, despite its problems, and why it was not written down gradually, rather than being slashed abruptly this year.\n\nRichard Wilson, an audit partner at EY, said \u201cwith hindsight\u201d the writedown should have come sooner. The \u00a31.1bn writedown of its MyTravel division pushed Thomas Cook into a \u00a31.5bn first-half loss in May.", "description": "Rachel Reeves, chair of business committee, says legal reform needed", "authors": ["Julia Kollewe", "Larry Elliott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a37381b5130ea794787a1074b29259d8b138a34/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e0f9f2e96cce12016311c6906b81ca39", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
