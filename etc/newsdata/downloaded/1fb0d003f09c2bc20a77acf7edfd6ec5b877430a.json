That has a number of consequences.\n\n\u2018That means that the Americans have made a false claim. She would not have been entitled to claim diplomatic immunity.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Mrs Sacoolas\u2019 legal representative Amy Jeffress, from the law firm Arnold and Porter, said: \u2018Anne is devastated by this tragic accident.\n\n\u2018No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\u2019\n\nOn Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said America was \u2018absolutely ruthless\u2019 in its safeguarding of Mrs Sacoolas following the decision to grant her diplomatic immunity.\n\nMr Johnson said although President Donald Trump was sympathetic towards Mr Dunn\u2019s family\u2019s views on the use of diplomatic immunity, the US was \u201cvery reluctant\u201d to allow its citizens to be tried abroad.\n\nSpeaking ahead of taking their campaign to the US, Harry\u2019s family said in a statement that they \u2018continue to live in a nightmare\u2019 and have so far been unable to grieve after his death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA statement released on behalf of the family said: \u2018As if losing Harry was not enough, they now find themselves having to expend enormous time and energy, which they can ill afford, generating sufficient publicity to garner public support to persuade the US government to help achieve closure and return the driver Mrs Sacoolas to England to face the consequences of her actions.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
