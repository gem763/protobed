These are the six things that we're going to sit down and say, 'We need action on these six things, otherwise we're not going to be able to move ahead,\" he said.\n\n\"These are our terms of what we're going to fight for.\"\n\nAccording to CBC's Poll Tracker, the Liberals and Conservatives are neck-and-neck nationwide, with the most likely outcome at this point being a minority government.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh laid down six priorities he said he wants to see met in exchange for working with another party in the next Parliament. He spoke to reporters in Ottawa Thursday ahead of the French-language debate. 1:12\n\nSingh ruled out working with the Conservatives in response to comments Leader Andrew Scheer made against same-sex marriage during a debate in the House of Commons nearly 15 years ago \u2014 so his party's list of conditions is directed at Justin Trudeau's Liberals.\n\nSingh said that, while today's announcement isn't about a formal coalition, any such negotiation with another party would have to cover his six \"urgent priorities\":\n\nA national, single-payer universal pharmacare plan a national dental care plan.\n\nInvestments in housing.\n\nA plan to waive interest on student loans.\n\nA commitment to reduce emissions, to end subsidies for oil companies and to deliver aid to oilpatch workers to transition them out of fossil fuel industries.\n\nThe introduction of a \"super wealth\" tax and a commitment to closing tax loopholes.\n\nReducing cellphone bills.\n\nHe also said his party will continue to push for reconciliation and proportional representation.\n\nSingh still urged Canadians to vote as many New Democrats into the House of Commons as possible on Oct. 21.\n\n\"I want you to vote for hope. I want you to vote because you believe in something. I want you to vote for something, not vote against something. Vote for something you believe in,\" he said.\n\n\"I want you to know you do not have to settle.\"", "description": "NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has started to lay down some of the conditions his party would want to see met in exchange for supporting another party in a minority Parliament scenario.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5316211.1570720905!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-ndp-20191010.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
