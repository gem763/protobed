Limuru Road and the Mathare River are on the southern side, and the Thika Super Highway and Kiambu Road are on the east. Six Parklands Avenue forms the western border.\n\nPrice Range\n\nIn addition to the size of the land, housing prices are determined by a home\u2019s size, age, finishes and amenities, according to Anthony Havelock, head of agency at Knight Frank Kenya.\n\n\u201cHouse-sale values in Muthaiga, by virtue of being owned by eminent personalities, are largely personal and confidential in nature,\u201d he added. \u201cThis makes it difficult for the market to have reliable collective data on the number of transactions and prices achieved.\u201d\n\nHe noted that, based on the available data on land sales, prices range from around KES160 million to KES200 million per acre (US$1.54 million to US$1.93 million), depending on the location in Muthaiga as well as the shape and gradient of the plot.\n\n\u201cThat said, property prices in Muthaiga are amongst some of the highest in Nairobi,\u201d he added.\n\nMore: Cultural Riches and Traditional Architecture in Kyoto\u2019s Kamigyo Ward\n\nNili Dodhia and Sansi Dietz, real estate brokers for Pam Golding Properties Kenya, said single-family houses on a half acre of property can command prices from KES120 million for an older residence to KES250 million for a newly constructed home.

He said that prime residential rents also declined over the same period\u2014by 1.68% compared to 0.33%.\n\nMore: Residential Resorts of Africa Are a Draw for Their Scenery and Serenity\n\n\u201cWe expect this trend to continue for the medium term\u2014two to three years\u2014as we head into the general elections in 2022 and if the capping of the interest rates is not repealed,\u201d he said. \u201cPurchasers, aware of the market dynamics, have become more discerning in their price expectations; eventually they offer what they consider to be the property\u2019s worth in the current market. This emerging trend has, to a large extent, begun to correct price levels in the property market as a whole.\u201d\n\nMs. Dodhia believes things are picking up.\n\n\u201cMuthaiga is a highly sought-after, top-end area that holds its prices very well,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have seen some properties experience price adjustments downward in the region of 20% over the last five years in Muthaiga. Last year, the market did soften while prices were adjusting and sellers were getting their heads around the new prices. Now, with the price adjustments, buyers have been more active in the market, and we are seeing a lot more movement.\u201d\n\nThis has not been the case, she added, in Kenya in general. \u201cPrices in some areas of the country have not changed very much. However, there are some areas where prices have been reduced,\u201d she said. \u201cThe infrastructure is changing, and this is having an impact on the housing market. The new roads that have been introduced are resulting in positives for some residents while some have sold.\u201d\n\nMs. Dietz added that \u201cthere is always an opportunity for buyers and sellers in any market. The Kenyan market continues to grow, and there is always room for more development and growth.\u201d\n\nClick for more profiles of high-end neighborhoods around the world", "description": "", "authors": ["Nancy A.
