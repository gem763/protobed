Neither has the BBC published any further reasoning for the director-general's decision to overturn that finding.\"\n\n'A matter of urgency'\n\nThe case \"highlights the need for the BBC to provide more transparency on the reasons for its findings\", the watchdog said, adding that it \"will be addressing the BBC's lack of transparency as a matter of urgency\".\n\nKevin Bakhurst, Ofcom's director for content and media policy, said: \"We have serious concerns around the transparency of the BBC's complaints process, which must command the confidence of the public.\n\n\"We'll be requiring the BBC to be more transparent about its processes and compliance findings as a matter of urgency.\"\n\nIn response, a BBC spokesman said: \"We note Ofcom's finding and the fact they agree with the director-general's decision.\"\n\nThe BBC's complaints framework says that, whenever the ECU upholds or resolves a complaint, it publishes a summary of its findings, rather than its full reasoning.\n\nOfcom received 18 complaints, mostly about the ECU's original decision, which said Munchetty was wrong to criticise Mr Trump's motives after he said four female politicians should \"go back\" to \"places from which they came\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption This exchange, broadcast on 17 July, sparked the complaint\n\nLegal advice\n\nLetters between the BBC and Ofcom were published by the regulator and revealed a disagreement over whether Ofcom had the right to investigate a BBC programme for breaches of content standards.\n\nThe BBC took legal advice on the matter and declined to supply additional information to Ofcom while the regulator was deciding whether to investigate the Breakfast hosts' comments.\n\nThe ECU's full reasons for partially upholding the original complaint were sent to the complainant, but had not been provided to Ofcom, the watchdog said.\n\nOfcom said: \"We had an exchange of correspondence with the BBC in which we invited the BBC to provide any further background information that it considered relevant for the purposes of helping us to carry out our assessment of the programme against the code.\n\n\"The BBC stated that it did not wish to provide any further information at this time. It also questioned whether it was within Ofcom's remit under the BBC Charter and Agreement to assess this programme.\"", "description": "Media regulator Ofcom has \"serious concerns around the transparency of the BBC's complaints process\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/76D0/production/_108961403_nagagetty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
