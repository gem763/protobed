Or rather, a grinning frog with extended alien eyes that Johnston rendered in black spray paint on the side of the old Sound Exchange at 21st Street and Guadalupe beckoned to me: \u201cHi, How Are You.\u201d Texans can be known for their gentle friendliness, but something about Johnston\u2019s greeting felt different, unguarded and maybe even a little nervous. It wasn\u2019t quite a question so much as an entreaty, a desire to reach out and find a connection with a stranger, from one of Austin\u2019s strangest, most endearing, and most misunderstood musical icons, Daniel Johnston, who died this week of natural causes at the age of 58.\n\nIf you were a native Texan, you were maybe already acquainted with Jeremiah the Innocent (as its own dedicated Yelp page describes the frog), as well as any number of Daniel Johnston characters, like the empty-headed Joe, Joe the Boxer, a flying eyeball, Captain America, and of course, Casper the Friendly Ghost. They could always be seen on the hand-drawn covers of his self-released cassettes, for sale at the front counter of the local record stores. These cassettes had songs with titles like \u201cI Am a Baby (in My Universe),\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Sun Go Down on Your Grievances,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Nervous,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll Do Anything But Break Dance for Ya, Darling.\u201d Over the years, they\u2019ve been lovingly covered by the likes of Tom Waits, Yo La Tengo, Death Cab for Cutie, the Flaming Lips, and Beck.\n\nJohnston was born in Sacramento but grew up in West Virginia, the youngest of five children in a Christian fundamentalist household. He was taken with drawing and became obsessed with the Beatles. \u201cWhen I was 19, I wanted to be the Beatles,\u201d he would later recall in a 1989 interview. \u201cI was disappointed when I found out I couldn\u2019t sing.\u201d That didn\u2019t stop Johnston from sitting in his parents\u2019 basement and pouring his heart and quavering emotions into a $60 Sanyo boom box, first while attending an art program at a branch of Kent State and then in Houston, where he worked at the River of No Return ride at AstroWorld by day and recorded songs on a detuned guitar, piano, and chord organ into the wee hours.\n\nWhen he landed in Austin in the mid-\u201980s, he found kindred spirits in weirdos like the Butthole Surfers and Glass Eye. He passed out tapes at the local McDonald\u2019s he worked at or on the Drag across the street from the University of Texas. \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cI\u2019m Daniel Johnston, and I\u2019m gonna be famous.\u201d Texas Monthly\u2019s Michael Hall recalled an early performance from Johnston at this time, bursting out from the busboy\u2019s closet \u2014 not as an act of showmanship, but rather deep fear and shyness \u2014 appearing \u201cso nervous he looked like he was about to cry\u201d before winning the crowd over in the span of a single song, \u201cI Live My Broken Dreams.\u201d He couldn\u2019t sing like the Beatles, but he could sing like someone who had huffed helium and was trembling with a fear akin to asking a crush out for the first time, ready to detail how he was feeling in embarrassing, but sincere detail.\n\nDaniel Johnston\u2019s songs might not get spun immemorially at a caf\u00e9 or public space \u2014 they feel far too raw, awkward, and intimate for that. His songs could be simultaneously off-putting and endearing, unfailingly sweet even as they verged on the questionable (Spin called his major-label debut, Fun, \u201cultra-lo-fi stalker ballads\u201d). There were well-crafted verses and choruses even as they began to wobble and spiral ever wider, with more lines and details crammed into them. Even when he was ranting about the chicken head-biting (and child-eating) perils of smoking marijuana, his pathos felt real when he got to the chorus (\u201cYou wanted to be somebody / But you ain\u2019t nobody / You ain\u2019t got no body / You\u2019re just a head\u201d). He could natter on about bicycle safety, but he also reproduced the thrill of speed on \u201cSpeeding Motorcycle.\u201d Johnston\u2019s songs were fragile in a way that could disarm even the most cynical of us. His enthusiastic yip and uncanny knack for soaring choruses was undeniable no matter the low fidelity. The music could feel silly and sincere, diaristic and voyeuristic, sometimes even in the space of a single line.\n\nIt\u2019s the only way to explain the glorious triumph of a song like \u201cWalking the Cow.\u201d Since covered by the likes of Pearl Jam and TV on the Radio, it\u2019s simple and jumbled, full of confusing feelings that instantly slip away from Johnston. He\u2019s jostled by the wind, riddled with fear, and yet undeterred, delivering the undeniable sweetness in an image like \u201cLucky stars in your eyes / I am walking the cow.\u201d\n\nMTV featured him in the mid-\u201980s on the show The Cutting Edge, and he found favor with the likes of Sonic Youth and Dead Milkmen. But as he crept toward fame \u2014 or at least a bigger audience and more professional recording setups \u2014 he had a number of nervous breakdowns and was ultimately diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. But if you were a kid in the \u201990s, you might have seen Jeremiah the Innocent in a most auspicious place, onstage at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards. Broadcast to an audience of millions, Kurt Cobain wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the cover art from Johnston\u2019s 1983 album Hi, How Are You: The Unfinished Album. A co-sign from the most powerful band on the planet meant a major-label bidding war soon followed for Johnston, never mind that he was still in a mental hospital. The end result was Johnston\u2019s unlikely appearance on Atlantic Records\u2019 Fun (1994), which Spin once ranked as the second weirdest album of the post-Nevermind era, notoriously selling in the neighborhood of 12,000 copies (or about .004 percent of what Nirvana sold).\n\nBut even without much fame or success, Johnston\u2019s influence began to spread. His drawings caught notice in the world of outsider art and galleries. His songs comprised a rock opera. He wound up in the Times art section and his drawings at the Whitney, but even during that time, a 2006 Pitchfork profile noted: \u201cIf you saw him on the street, you might assume he was homeless.\u201d The moving 2005 documentary The Devil and Daniel Johnston captured the many contradictions of the man. His health issues mounted but he also found himself collaborating with the likes of Sparklehorse\u2019s Mark Linkous, and on at least one occasion counted Wilco\u2019s Jeff Tweedy as a member of his backing band.\n\nThe same man who gazed out in childlike wonder at the world also faced very serious consequences of his mental disease. Stories abound about how he nearly killed himself and his father on a flight. And in one disturbing incident, Johnston believed an elderly woman was possessed by Satan and broke into her home, making her leap out of a window and break both legs. At times when such mental illness can become tragic and violent (and not just harmless and quaint), Johnston\u2019s work and life continue to resonate. The nonprofit Hi, How Are You Project was established to help cast light on mental illness, and Austin last year declared January 22 to be \u201cHi, How Are You?\u201d Day. Johnston outlived the likes of Cobain and Linkous, while his mural not only outlasted the record store that commissioned it back in 1993, but almost every other business on the Drag. His music and his message will continue to greet the dispossessed and depressed, those unable to say how they are feeling or even what they are feeling. In that way, Daniel Johnston will continue to welcome the most fragile of us.", "description": "One of Austin\u2019s strangest, most endearing, and most misunderstood musical icons died this week.
