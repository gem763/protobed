Presented by\n\nPresident Donald Trump now says he won\u2019t meet with Iran without preconditions. | Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nTHE PRESIDENT at 7:02 p.m.: \u201cThe Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, \u2018No Conditions.\u2019 That is an incorrect statement (as usual!).\u201d\n\n\u2026 THE PRESIDENT in June to NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd: \u201cNo pre-conditions.\u201d NBC\n\n\u2026 Secretary of State MIKE POMPEO, on Tuesday: \u201cHe is prepared to meet with no preconditions.\u201d\n\nWOMP WOMP ... NYT: \u201cIran has dismissed the possibility of a meeting between the country\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, and President Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly next week, Iran\u2019s state-run news media reported.\n\n\u201c\u2018Neither is such a plan on our agenda nor will such a thing happen,\u2019 Seyed Abbas Mousavi, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, said at a news conference on Monday, according to Fars, a state-run outlet. \u2018This meeting will not be held.\u2019\u201d NYT\n\nMEANWHILE -- \u201cSaudi Oil Attack Photos Implicate Iran, U.S. Says; Trump Hints at Military Action,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Eric Schmitt, Farnaz Fassihi and David Kirkpatrick: \u201cThe government released satellite photographs showing what officials said were at least 17 points of impact at several Saudi energy facilities from strikes they said came from the north or northwest. That would be consistent with an attack coming from the direction of the northern Persian Gulf, Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen, where the Iranian-backed Houthi militia that claimed responsibility for the strikes operates.\n\n\u201cAdministration officials, in a background briefing for reporters as well as in separate interviews on Sunday, also said a combination of drones and cruise missiles \u2014 \u2018both and a lot of them,\u2019 as one senior United States official put it \u2014 might have been used. That would indicate a degree of scope, precision and sophistication beyond the ability of the Houthi rebels alone.\u201d NYT\n\n-- WAPO: \u201cHis administration was contemplating what U.S. officials characterized as a serious military response, though some in the Pentagon were said to be urging restraint. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Trump met with Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper on Sunday afternoon.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- WSJ: \u201cSupply Shock Sends Oil Prices Soaring,\u201d by Benoit Faucon in London, Summer Said in Dubai and Amrith Ramkumar: \u201cThe loss of nearly 6% of global oil output in weekend strikes in Saudi Arabia sent crude prices soaring as officials said the kingdom was racing to restore roughly one-third of the disrupted production by day\u2019s end Monday.\u201d\n\nJOE BIDEN on Sunday night at a fundraiser in Miami, per Miami Herald\u2019s David Smiley: \u201cHis embrace of [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un -- he\u2019s a thug. There is no other answer. This is a guy who had his uncle\u2019s brains blown out sitting across the table. \u2026 And he\u2019s writing love letters to him, talking about love letters.\u201d\n\nROAD SHOW \u2026 THE PRESIDENT will travel to Houston with Indian PM NARENDRA MODI and Wapakoneta, Ohio, with Australian PM SCOTT MORRISON on Sunday.

Trump issued a veto threat on the House\u2019s background-checks bill earlier this year, and few Republicans in Congress support it.\n\n\u201cBut in a conversation with Trump on Sunday morning, the House speaker and Senate minority leader indicated to Trump that they were taking a much harder line than rank-and-file senators involved in the talks.\n\n\u201c\u2018This morning, we made it clear to the president that any proposal he endorses that does not include the House-passed universal background checks legislation will not get the job done, as dangerous loopholes will still exist and people who shouldn\u2019t have guns will still have access,\u2019 Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cThe two leaders said they promised to join Trump \u2018for a historic signing ceremony at the Rose Garden\u2019 if the president would endorse the legislation and lean on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to pass it \u2018to save as many lives as possible.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\nELECTION TOMORROW \u2026 AP/JERUSALEM: \u201cIsraeli PM vows to annex \u2018all the settlements\u2019 in West Bank\u201d: \u201cIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Monday to annex \u2018all the settlements\u2019 in the West Bank, including an enclave deep in the heart of the largest Palestinian city, in a last-ditch move that appeared aimed at shoring up nationalist support the day before a do-over election.\n\n\u201cLocked in a razor tight race and with legal woes hanging over him, Netanyahu is fighting for his political survival. In the final weeks of his campaign he has been doling out hard-line promises meant to draw more voters to his Likud party and re-elect him in Tuesday\u2019s unprecedented repeat vote.\u201d AP\n\nGood Monday morning.\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

It wasn\u2019t clear how long the walkout would last, with the union saying GM has budged little in months of talks while GM said it made substantial offers including higher wages and factory investments.\u201d AP\n\n2020 WATCH -- \u201cBiden Has Deep Connection to Black Voters. Will It Translate Into Votes?\u201d by NYT\u2019s Katie Glueck in Birmingham: \u201cAt the Democratic primary debate last week, Joseph R. Biden Jr. prompted some distress within the party with a rambling, discordant answer to a question about the legacy of slavery, a moment that highlighted his unsteady instincts, and mixed record, on matters of race. Three days later, a heavily African-American crowd gave Mr. Biden a warm welcome as he delivered a passionate address at the 16th Street Baptist Church, a symbol of the civil rights struggle, where he denounced institutional racism to mark the 56th anniversary of the bombing that killed four young black girls here in 1963.\n\n\u201cThe divergent responses underscore the uncertainty surrounding whether Mr. Biden can translate his longstanding connection to black voters into votes next year. His deep ties to black leaders, his service as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president and his popularity among older, more conservative African Americans have given him a commanding lead in the polls among a constituency that is crucial to any Democratic candidate seeking the nomination.\n\n\u201cBut that support has never been rigorously tested at the ballot box outside of his home state of Delaware, and missteps like his meandering debate answer on slavery, as well as his legislative record on issues like busing and criminal justice, have intensified questions among progressive activists, and some party leaders, about whether he is the best standard-bearer for African-American priorities.\u201d NYT\n\nA message from Softbank: We're on track to invest $50 billion in U.S. companies by the end of 2020.

Until a Trump Forecast Brought a Storm,\u201d by Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Steve Eder in Calera, Ala.: \u201cIt had been a sleepy Sunday morning in the National Weather Service\u2019s office outside of Birmingham. The hot temperatures in the forecast were not out of the ordinary for the waning days of summer. There was a faraway tropical storm that the office was keeping an eye on \u2014 one with the name of Dorian \u2014 but with each passing day, it seemed more likely to veer in a different direction.\n\n\u201cThen, out of nowhere, there came a flurry.\n\n\u201cIt was incoming phone calls from Alabamians energized about Hurricane Dorian, suddenly confused and worried about whether they were in the path of the giant Caribbean storm. At one point, the few people on duty were all answering calls at the same time. In response to the alarm, one employee dashed off a short message to the office\u2019s 50,000 Twitter followers that reaffirmed what the latest models were saying: Alabama had little to worry about. \u2026\n\n\u201cSeveral forecasters said the employee who sent the tweet hadn\u2019t even been aware of Mr. Trump\u2019s post and had simply reacted to an influx of calls from the public. \u2018We don\u2019t monitor the president\u2019s tweets,\u2019 said Michael Garrison, who manages the office\u2019s data on rainfall and temperatures and is the local steward for the National Weather Service Employees Organization. \u2018Up until this point, it has nothing to do with what we do.\u2019\u201d NYT\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.
