Six in 10 Democratic voters in the state are black.\n\nIn receiving the award on Friday, Trump extolled his record on race and criminal justice before a largely handpicked and appreciative audience. The award recognised Trump last year signing bipartisan legislation including easing harsh minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.\n\n\"This president has been fueling racism. He has been preaching racism from our highest office in this land,\" said US Senator Cory Booker. \"He does not have the support of communities like this that he actively demeans, degrades and disempowers.\"\n\nTrump hopes his support for a sweeping criminal justice reform law will help him pick up votes among African Americans next year after only winning 8 percent of the black vote in 2016. The president easily won South Carolina, where Republican voters outnumber Democrats two-to-one, in 2016.\n\nOn Twitter, the president shot back at Harris, calling her a \"badly failing presidential candidate\" and said low unemployment and new criminal justice reforms achieved during his administration are \"more than Kamala will EVER be able to do for African Americans!\"\n\nBiden, Warren\n\nTen Democrats seeking the presidential nomination are speaking at events in South Carolina this weekend and presenting plans on legalising marijuana, ending the death penalty and eliminating sentencing disparities for offenses involving crack cocaine and powder cocaine, which have disproportionately affected black people.\n\n190720065631261\n\nIn South Carolina, Democrats are working to chip away at a strong lead in the polls held by presidential candidate Joe Biden. Bolstered by the eight years he served as vice president to Barack Obama, the first black US president, Biden has deep connections with black politicians and clergy.\n\nBiden leads his closest rival in South Carolina, Senator Elizabeth Warren, by nearly 20 percentage points, according to a RealClearPolitics average of recent polls.\n\nThe state may end up being crucial for the former vice president as a last line of defense if he continues to lose ground to rivals in Iowa and New Hampshire.", "description": "Seven Democrats participated in a forum, a day after Trump was presented an award there for his work on criminal justice", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/26/c8c80c2c5f764c5eae3a415fcf816cdd_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
