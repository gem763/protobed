AstraZeneca added 2.3% after the pharmaceutical giant raised its annual product sales forecast for the second time this year, thanks in part to strong demand for new cancer treatments. the other end of the spectrum was Royal Bank of Scotland that skidded 3% as it swung to a third-quarter loss due to a fresh 900 million pound provision to settle mis-selling claims in Britain's biggest consumer banking scandal.\n\nFTSE 100 heads for fourth session of gains", "description": "FTSE 100 heads for fourth session of gains", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB8506G_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
