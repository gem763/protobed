The infusion was instigated at the behest of Farah's then-coach Salazar.\n\nHead of US Anti-Doping Travis Tygart has re-opened the question as to why England football team doctor Rob Chakraverty (above) failed to record level of infusion he gave Sir Mo Farah. Tygart has made no criticism of Farah\n\nChakraverty was questioned by a House of Commons Select Committee inquiry for failing to record the amount with which he infused Farah but said it was well under the 50ml limit.\n\nTygart said: 'In the US it is standard practice to record the volume of infusion you give someone. I don't know what it would be in the UK but in the US it's absolutely standard practice.'\n\nDr Chakraverty said his was a 'busy job' because of the travel involved and told the House of Commons: 'If you don't record it straight away, which I didn't in this case, it can get forgotten.'\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate said that the England team had never used the supplement in question nor infusions of any kind.\n\n'I'm not familiar with L-Carnitine,' said Southgate.\n\n'Only from reading about this case. We don't use the infusion at all. In terms of Rob, I think, as an organisation, we feel that the investigation that took place when there was a select committee went through procedures, went through everything was correct and everything that should've been done better, but nobody saw fit from all the authorities to take things any further at that time.\n\n'Although other areas have altered in that time, I don't think that anything about Rob has.'", "description": "Dr Chakraverty, chief medical officer at UK Athletics at the time, gave an L-Carnitine infusion to Farah before the 2014 London Marathon.
