She said:\n\n\u201cAny woman, especially when they\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re really vulnerable, and so that was made really challenging. And then when you have a newborn, you know. And especially as a woman, it\u2019s a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed.
