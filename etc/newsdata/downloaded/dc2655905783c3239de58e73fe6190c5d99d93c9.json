Nadiya is a fantastic teacher, she is the best partner I could have had on this show.\n\n\"But there is a goal and that's to be successful on the show too, so it's great that we work so well together.\"\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSpeaking about the Strictly curse, which has seen several relationships form over the years between celebrities and their professional dance partners, David said: \"My view is that, in life itself, if two people are attracted to each other then something might happen, and it doesn't need to be Strictly that causes that.\n\n\"I think the situation with Nadiya and myself... there's a goal in this. Nadiya is a fantastic teacher, I want to be a fantastic student, but we're on Strictly Come Dancing , not Love Island or some other show where people get themselves together.\n\n\"As I said, I think the chemistry between the two of us is perfect because we know what we're here for and we're enjoying the process, even though being in the dance-off isn't fun.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nDavid is reportedly single but Nadiya is in a relationship with Slovenian footballer Matija Skarabot.\n\nJames joked that he would not use the word \"desperate\" to describe how much he wants to stay in the competition.\n\nHe added: \"I don't want to be desperate about anything, I just want us to perform at a better level than we've done before and show some sort of progression.\n\nHe said being in the bottom two is \"not a nice place to be in\".\n\nLast week they were saved from elimination by the judges after a dance-off with Anneka Rice.\n\nThe previous week they had seen off Olympian James Cracknell.\n\n*Strictly Come Dancing airs on BBC One on Saturday at 6.40pm.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
