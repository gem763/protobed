It sounds as if Justin Trudeau\u2019s future as Prime Minister is still hanging by a thread at the moment:\n\nVoting ended in Newfoundland and Labrador, which account for seven of the 338 seats in the House of Commons\u2026 Darrell Bricker, an Ipsos pollster, said: \u201cThe truth is it\u2019s a coin toss right now.\u201d\u2026 If the Liberals are the largest party they may seek to form a minority government with the backing of the NDP. Should the Conservatives be the largest party they may seek to govern with Quebec\u2019s separatist Bloc Quebecois party.\n\nThe National Post reports some dirty tricks are being investigated. An unknown number of people received robocalls telling them the election was Tuesday instead of Monday:\n\nOn election day itself, a new controversy arose, with Elections Canada reporting that people in Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia had received robocalls telling them that voting was Tuesday, not Monday, CBC reported. It was not immediately clear how many people received the robocalls.\n\nSpeaking of Tuesday, CTV says the hashtag #TrudeaulessTuesday is trending on social media:\n\nThe hashtag \u201c#TrudeaulessTuesday\u201d had been used more than 25,000 times on Twitter by Monday evening and was one of the top four most trending phrases on the social media platform, just 2.5 hours before the polls closed. \u201cLet\u2019s pray that Canada becomes \u2018Trudeauless\u2019 again Tuesday morning,\u201d wrote one user. The hashtag was also widely used on Facebook posts throughout the evening.\n\nYou can track the results of the election here at the Toronto Star or at the National Post homepage. I\u2019ll update this post if it looks like there are any surprise trends in the results but for now the expectation is that this is going to be a late night:\n\nIf Quebec and Ontario vote counts take as long as the Atlantic, we won't know anything definitive by 11 PM. Long night ahead. #cdnpoli #elxn43 \u2014 Susan Delacourt (@SusanDelacourt) October 22, 2019\n\nUpdate: The Star reports Trudeau will remain PM, but the Liberal Party will need to form a minority government.", "description": "\"The truth is it's a coin toss right now.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Trudeau.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
