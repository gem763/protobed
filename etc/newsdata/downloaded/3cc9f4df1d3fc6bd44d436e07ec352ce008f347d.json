At the end of every debate, The Fix\u2019s Aaron Blake ranks the winners and losers from the night. Below is our analysis of what each candidate needs to do to land in the winner column.\n\n[Who has qualified for the fourth Democratic debate?]\n\n[Fix rankings: The Democratic candidates' likelihood off winning]\n\nWe\u2019ve also included their average in high-quality polls of Democratic primary voters, as compiled by The Post\u2019s Polling team, and where they fall on the Fix\u2019s rankings of who\u2019s most likely to be the nominee.\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nPolling average: 26 percent | Fix ranking: 1\n\nShe has leads in some polls, nationally and in early-voting states. She is raising millions more than former vice president Joe Biden. And she\u2019s been declared a winner by The Fix in the last three debates as other candidates have either declined to or not figured out how to attack her. But with more standing comes more scrutiny, as the Massachusetts senator saw recently when political opponents drummed up accusations she wasn\u2019t fired for being pregnant as a teacher. (She maintains she was.) Warren still faces questions about the financial cost of Medicare-for-all on middle-class taxpayers, as experts question her and Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s (I-Vt.) assertion that costs will definitely go down. Still, with Biden focused on how to respond to President Trump and Sanders having his own problems, this is the moment Warren could stand out in a way she hasn\u2019t yet on the debate stage: As the unequivocal leader.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nPolling average: 27 percent | Fix ranking: 2\n\nAfter largely ignoring Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated allegations that Biden as vice president intervened in Ukrainian politics to help his son\u2019s business ties, Biden has recently switched tactics to confronting the allegations and the president. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. \u201cTrump won\u2019t destroy me, and he won\u2019t destroy my family.\u201d Some of his supporters warned him that Trump and his conservative media machine will flood the information stage if he doesn\u2019t speak up and call Trump out when he\u2019s wrong. Biden seems to now agree. But it means that he\u2019s running an election campaign while still in a primary. And especially for that reason, his team is playing whack-a-mole with Trump allies spreading disinformation on social media and in the media. A recent poll shows a plurality of Americans are wondering if the allegations are true, and at least one of his 2020 opponents said they wouldn\u2019t let family members have such close business ties to their work. In addition, Biden hasn\u2019t shaken off questions about his acuity from sluggish previous debate performances. Given all this, how can Biden show Democratic voters he\u2019s up to the task of such relentless confrontations with Trump?\n\n[In Trump's attacks against Biden, Democrats see a worrisome repeat of 2016]\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nPolling average: 16 percent | Fix ranking: 3\n\nThe debate comes at a tough time for Sanders, who was hospitalized for a heart attack and paused campaigning, right after he shared he raised the most money of all candidates these past three months. Sanders is 78 and the oldest candidate running for president. He would be the oldest president ever (though Biden and Warren are in their 70s, too, and would set a record if elected). His campaign waited days to announce he had a heart attack and won\u2019t answer questions about how serious it was. Sanders is resting now and it\u2019s possible Tuesday\u2019s debate will be his first campaign appearance since the heart attack. It\u2019s fair to say his age and health are the last things Sanders will want to talk about on the debate stage \u2014 but that\u2019s reality when you\u2019re running for president and every aspect of your life is under scrutiny.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nPolling average: 5 percent | Fix ranking: 4\n\nShe had a dream first debate this summer, after attacking Biden for his position on school busing. But Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) failed to translate that momentum to the campaign trail. Her polling has dropped precipitously since this summer, into the single digits, according to an average of top polls from RealClearPolitics. Even her home state, California, is indifferent to her candidacy, reports The Post\u2019s David Weigel. Harris needs an extra-strong debate performance. That will be extra tough to do on a crowded stage of 12 candidates, where the national story is elsewhere, like on impeachment.\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nPolling average: 5 percent | Fix ranking: 5\n\nThe South Bend, Ind., mayor continues to pull in impressive fundraising hauls \u2014 $19 million in the quarter that just ended \u2014 and has had steady debate performances. But he hasn\u2019t dominated headlines since his entrance in the race, when some compared him to a young Barack Obama. Like Harris, his candidacy just hasn\u2019t gained the traction he needs to reach the first tier. His biggest moments on the debate stages so far have come from criticizing Warren and Sanders\u2019s take-it-or-leave-it liberal policy proposals, so there could be an opening there for him to be more aggressive \u2014 and more noticeable.\n\nCory Booker\n\nPolling average: 1 percent | Fix ranking: 6\n\nThe New Jersey senator has no problem with aggressive campaigning and debating. \u201cMr. Vice President, there\u2019s a saying in my community, you\u2019re dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don\u2019t even know the flavor,\u201d he said in a July debate in a back-and-forth with Biden over their criminal justice reform records. This past week, Biden has been Booker\u2019s ticket again to national headlines. More than the other senators running, Booker leveraged his role as a senator who would be a jurist of Trump\u2019s impeachment by defending Biden from the unsubstantiated Ukraine allegations that Trump peddled to the Ukrainian president. \u201c... If you come after Joe Biden, you\u2019re going to have to deal with me\u2026,\u201d he told CNN last week. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, went after Booker afterward. A few days later, a fired-up Booker got a standing ovation while speaking to a receptive crowd of 300 in Iowa.\n\nJulian Castro, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard\n\nFor these candidates, all of whom are polling at one or two percent, they need to make a moment in this debate. Controversy is always a good bet to get noticed, but there\u2019s a way to take that overboard. (See former Obama administration Cabinet member Julian Castro in September\u2019s debate, who appeared to go there on Biden\u2019s age: \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d)\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is raising the bar for who qualifies for the Nov. 20 debate, above the polling averages of a number of candidates here. Yang has made it in but the rest are in danger of not.\n\nTom Steyer\n\nPolling average: 1 percent | Fix ranking: 11\n\nThe only new person on the debate stage Tuesday will be billionaire Tom Steyer. His campaign to date is mostly self-funded, and he entered the race late, after Biden, Warren and Sanders were already dominating the polls. Steyer is best known for his activism (and his willingness to put money behind it) on climate change and to push Democrats to impeach Trump. Now that impeachment may be happening, can Steyer have an \u201cI told you so?\u201d moment on the debate stage that helps place his candidacy in perspective?\n\nEmily Guskin and Kevin Uhrmacher contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/O7wH4XT-vKzzltQROQ_wWDgxb8E=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YQI3LX6QGRGKRFGDHZONTEQLFM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
