This little office serves the same purpose now.\n\n\u201cIt is really important,\" he says, looking around him. \"We have all the staff in here after games. We have had some great results, especially at home, over the last couple of years. But we have had long nights in here after defeats as well. A number of times we have walked out of here at 3am having just tried to put everything right. It is quite easy when you are successful but you dig deeper when you lose.\u201d\n\nThe setting may have changed, but his approach is still pretty much the same. Chris has spent 17 years building his reputation working with little money at clubs like Alfreton Town, Halifax, Oxford and Northampton. Now he is adjusting to life in the Premier League with his beloved United, the club he has supported all his life, and played for in the late 1980s during a career in the lower leagues.\n\nHe started out as an apprentice at Southampton learning from manager Lawrie McMenemy and senior pros, all England internationals, like Mick Mills and Peter Shilton. It was a different game then. \u201cPlayers used to take more responsibility about their own performances and the person sat next to them. I don\u2019t think the manager had to do as much as he does now because we used to problem solve out on the pitch. I would problem solve more than they do now and that is not being critical.\n\n\"We used to get into other players\u2019 heads mentally and physically. In my day it was me versus you, my future versus your future. It is not like that now. There is a handshaking culture now and we are all pals - \u2018what are you doing later?\u2019 That kind of thing. I sometimes struggle to get my head around it. I used to think: 'what can I say to him that might put him off his game?' That was a mentality we had.\u201d", "description": "We are sat in Chris Wilder\u2019s office at Sheffield United, just a few steps away from the double doors that lead out onto the pitch at Bramall Lane.", "authors": ["Michael Vaughan", "Jamie Carragher"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000213383560-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqQTrJsyUJrJfQCV7bNQW3tMtg8Zy97RVY00fOTlVjnvQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
