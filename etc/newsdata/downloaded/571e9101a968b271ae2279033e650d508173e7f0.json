But as stablecoins \u201cmight be more readily usable\u201d as a means of payment and store of value, issuers should ensure regulations are followed through.\n\n\u201cNo global stablecoin project should begin operation until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks [...] are adequately addressed, through appropriate designs and by adhering to regulation that is clear and proportional,\u201d said G7.\n\nThe Libra Association responded to G7 on the report, saying that Libra stablecoin will \u201coperate with transparency and in partnership with regulators,\u201d adding: \u201cLibra is being designed to work with existing regulatory institutions and apply the protections they provide to the digital world -- not disrupt or undermine them.\u201d\n\nThe G7 in its report further said that governments across the world should develop road maps for improving the efficiency and lowering the cost of payments and financial services. Further, \u201ccentral banks, individually and collectively, will assess the relevance of issuing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in view of the costs and benefits in their respective jurisdictions,\u201d said the group.", "description": "Cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, have so far failed to provide a \"reliable and attractive\" means of payment or store of value, according to a report from the Group of Seven (G7) nations.The post Bitcoin has failed as a means of payment or store of value: G7 report appeared first on The", "authors": ["Yogita Khatri"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fgyxYiZv1kQu8uSyOlODMw--~B/aD00NTA7dz02NzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_block_83/6a43105bbdd04803c8acc215d6488bf4", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
