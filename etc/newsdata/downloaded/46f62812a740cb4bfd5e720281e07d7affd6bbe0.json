We\u2019re going to have our game plan, and we\u2019re going to execute it.\u201d\n\nThe 25th-ranked Spartans host Indiana on Saturday, and it sounds like the Hoosiers plan to wait until kickoff before indicating if quarterback Michael Penix Jr. will play. He has missed the last two games with an undisclosed injury, giving Peyton Ramsey - last year\u2019s starter - a chance to reclaim the job, at least temporarily.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Indiana coach Tom Allen said Thursday on the topic of Penix\u2019s availability. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make that decision. It will be announced at kickoff, but just continue to progress and we\u2019ll see where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nDespite using two different starting quarterbacks, Indiana is No. 2 in the Big Ten with 308.5 yards passing per game. The Hoosiers (3-1, 0-1) face quite a test this weekend, though. Michigan State (3-1, 1-0) is tremendous against the run and can rush the passer as well. Willekes, Raequan Williams and the rest of the Spartans\u2019 defensive front will be ready to pressure whoever is taking snaps for Indiana.\n\nThe questions for Michigan State are on offense. It\u2019s still hard to tell what to expect from the Spartans in a given week. They were fairly unimpressive in a season-opening win over Tulsa. Then they rebounded with a 51-point effort against Western Michigan. That was followed by a desultory 10-7 loss to Arizona State at home - and then last weekend\u2019s 31-10 win at Northwestern.\n\n\u201cEvery game, it\u2019s probably little things,\u201d offensive coordinator Brad Salem said. \u201cAfter the Arizona State game, our big focus is finish. You\u2019re moving the ball, but the reality is you have to score.\u201d\n\nAgainst Northwestern, Michigan State had five red zone trips and came away with four touchdowns and a field goal.\n\nA few more things to watch when the Spartans host Indiana:\n\nTROPHY\n\nThe winner of this game gets the Old Brass Spittoon, and recently the series has been dominated by Michigan State. The Spartans have won two in a row and 17 of their last 20 against Indiana.\n\nTACKLE BY COMMITTEE?\n\nAllen continues to search for the best way to replace left tackle Coy Cronk, a four-year starter who suffered a season-ending lower right leg injury.\n\nAfter Cronk was carted off the field last Saturday, Allen moved right tackle Caleb Jones to the left side. Freshman Matthew Bedford finished the game at left tackle and on Monday, the depth chart listed Jones as the starting left tackle, DaVondre Love at right tackle and Bedford backing up Jones.\n\nThat could change based on whether the left-handed Penix is healthy enough to play or the right-handed Ramsey makes his third straight start.\n\n\u201cJust trying to get those guys ready to roll, so - but that\u2019s what you have to do,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you recruit and that\u2019s why you develop your guys and I just think it\u2019s a great opportunity for somebody to step up and take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nPOSSIBLE MILESTONE\n\nOnly one Michigan State quarterback has thrown for 6,000 yards and rushed for 1,000 in his career. That was Drew Stanton, who played for the Spartans over a decade ago.\n\nBrian Lewerke can join Stanton with 39 more yards rushing.\n\nTARGET\n\nMichigan State\u2019s Darrell Stewart leads the Big Ten with 30 receptions and 439 yards receiving.\n\nFIRST TRIP\n\nThis is Indiana\u2019s first true road game of the season. The Hoosiers faced Ball State in Indianapolis and played their other three games at home.\n\nOf course, home-field advantage didn\u2019t help much in Indiana\u2019s first Big Ten game - a 51-10 loss to Ohio State on Sept. 14.\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kenny Willekes expects his Michigan State defense to be ready, no matter who is playing quarterback for Indiana.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/indiana_penix_football_78061_c0-118-2814-1758_s1770x1032.jpg?726ffb50cf34401b768b2f62da2bdef97cbc891c", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
