(Don Wright/AP)\n\nWith Ben Roethlisberger out for the season due to an elbow injury and backup Mason Rudolph still in concussion protocol, the Pittsburgh Steelers will turn to their third quarterback of the season when undrafted rookie Devlin Hodges gets the start against the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday night.\n\nHodges filled in for Rudolph after the second-year QB out of Oklahoma State suffered a concussion from a hit delivered by Baltimore Ravens safety Earl Thomas early in the third quarter of last week\u2019s game. Hodges led the Steelers to a game-tying touchdown on that drive and then a go-ahead field goal two drives later. The Ravens eventually won in overtime.\n\nHodges originally joined the Steelers as an undrafted free agent out of Samford following a May tryout. He was cut in training camp but joined the practice squad in mid-September after Pittsburgh traded quarterback Josh Dobbs, a 2017 fourth-round selection, to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Hodges was then promoted to the active roster days later when Roethlisberger was placed on injured reserve.\n\n[Steelers\u2019 season could rest in the hands of QB Devlin Hodges]\n\nWhile Hodges isn\u2019t a household name among NFL fans, he entered the league with a reputation.\n\nHodges broke Steve McNair\u2019s Football Championship Subdivision record by throwing for 14,584 yards while at Samford. His 2018 season earned him the Walter Payton Award, given annually to the best offensive player in the FCS.\n\nAs a redshirt freshman, he earned the nickname \u201cDuck\u201d for his prowess as a skilled duck caller, a hobby he picked up as a kid. He quickly honed the craft and won the 2009 Junior World Duck Calling Contest at age 13.\n\nDevlin Hodges: World Champion Duck Caller Quarterback. Duck Caller. Devlin Hodges shows us what it takes to become a world champion in duck calling. Posted by Pittsburgh Steelers on Wednesday, August 28, 2019\n\nHodges will have former Denver Broncos first-round pick Paxton Lynch serving as his backup Sunday night. The Steelers promoted Lynch from the practice squad on Friday.\n\nHodges\u2019s teammates have faith in the rookie\u2019s ability to help lift the 1-4 Steelers out of their current doldrums.\n\n\u201cHe was a star in camp. He was patient, poised,\u201d center Maurkice Pouncey said Wednesday. \u201cYou could tell he has been around offenses a long time and knows how to adjust to things. It was awesome to see. He was the star at camp. All of the guys thought he was going to make it here. We are all happy for him to be back. He is a positive kid and we like being around those type of guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Devlin is in there, he has that voice in the huddle he is able to get everybody under control, say everything with confidence, get everybody lined up, know where the hots are and know where the line is working,\u201d newly-acquired tight end Nick Vannett said. \u201cAll of that. Everything a quarterback needs to know in this offense, he knows. I think he has the confidence. You saw it in the game. I don\u2019t think there is any drop off. He is stepping up and we aren\u2019t missing a beat.\n\n\u201cWe all have full confidence in him and full trust in him.\u201d\n\nWide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who is still looking for his first 100-yard game of the season after posting eight of them in 2018, likes his new quarterback\u2019s fearlessness.\n\n\u201cOne thing about Hodges is he\u2019s going to throw it regardless,\u201d Smith-Schuster said Friday. \u201cHe trusts it to us, he puts it out there \u2026 Either we catch it, nobody catches it, and that\u2019s when he runs it. He\u2019s very confident in the huddle.\u201d\n\nWhat separates Hodges from the competition is his mental makeup, according to Samford offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Russ Callaway.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have an unbelievable arm like [Los Angeles Rams quarterback Jared] Goff,\u201d Callaway told ESPN. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have that elite of an arm, but it\u2019s not far behind. His moxie, his cockiness, his quick release and just his ball playin', to me, makes up for what he lacks in all that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is an exciting kid,\u201d Pouncey said. \u201cHe\u2019s motivated. He has a lot of confidence. That is what you like to see in a quarterback.\n\n\u201cHe is cool as hell, too.\u201d\n\nMore NFL:\n\nEagles\u2019 Zach Brown calls Kirk Cousins \u2018weakest part\u2019 of the Vikings offense\n\nChristian McCaffrey is doing the impossible: Building an NFL MVP case as a running back\n\nRob Gronkowski drops comeback hint during debut as Fox Sports analyst", "description": "Nicknamed \"Duck,\" the undrafted rookie signal-caller set the FCS record for career passing yards in 2018.", "authors": ["Jake Russell", "Sports News Aide", "October At Am", "Jake Russell Has Been A Sports News Aide", "Blogger With The Washington Post Since His Book", "Things Nationals Fans Should Know", "Do Before They Die", "Was Published In"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VrGmmnJtNUil6zOSiFuDTSCBqeQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NYEFGMHIPAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
