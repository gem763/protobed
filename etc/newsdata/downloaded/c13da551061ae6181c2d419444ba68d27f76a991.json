There were no real digs at Warren, who is played by one of the show's most popular stars, and who is the darling of the sorts of progressives who work at places like Saturday Night Live. We'll see how and if they decide to ridicule her at some point; I mean, how is this not the stuff of comedy gold? By the way, SNL lumped Harris in with the group of candidates who actually have a shot at winning the nomination, but does that reflect reality? She's been tanking over the last month-plus of polling -- nationally, in key early states, and even in her home state. I'll leave you with Harris going the \"leave Joe Biden alone\" route, trying to call any questions about the Bidens' ethics a very distracty distraction from the One True Scandal involving President Trump:\n\nIt will be fascinating to see how the other Democratic candidates handle the Hunter Biden matter when it comes up in the next debate https://t.co/75AVC6AgGE \u2014 Rich Lowry (@RichLowry) September 29, 2019\n\n\n\nMaybe she's trying to make nice after launching her famous and somewhat ironic attack on Biden, for which she's mocked in the SNL skit above. Finally, how does this stupid, demagogic garbage align with Harris' supposedly dogged opposition to distractions from Ukraine?\n\nKamala Harris calls for formal impeachment inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh https://t.co/Sl2hVXbsiD \u2014 Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) September 27, 2019\n\n\n\nHer hacktastic desperation is palpable, and her collapse has been satisfying to watch. And for what it's worth, Warren did the same thing:", "description": "Lampoon..09/30/2019 20:07:37PM EST.", "authors": ["Guy Benson", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/272/65d5886e-6e37-4180-8bfc-0ed82137400f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
