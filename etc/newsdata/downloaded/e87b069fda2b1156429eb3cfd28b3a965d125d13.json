Taylor delivered an opening statement on Tuesday linking a delay in U.S. military aid to Ukraine and an agreement to investigate President Trump\u2019s political foes.\n\nSee: It took career diplomat Bill Taylor \u2014 who complied with a House subpoena to appear, after the State Department reportedly sought to block his testimony \u2014 a full hour just to read his opening statement\n\nAs a reminder, the articles of impeachment against both Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon included abuse of power as a key pillar. But, today, Whitaker, with Ingraham in support, sees it as an attack by \u201cglobal elitists and careerists\u201d who want to punish Trump for \u201cupsetting the apple cart.\u201d\n\nWatch the interview:\n\nWhitaker immediately began trending on Twitter TWTR, -1.42% , where his unorthodox Fox remarks were received in a perhaps more predictable manner:\n\nAnd the nominees for the 2019 Gaslight Awards are...\n\n\n\nRudy Giuliani's \"The Truth is not the truth.\"\n\n\n\nMatthew Whitaker's \"Abuse of power is not a crime.\"\n\n\n\nMark Levin's \"While Trump's been president there hasn't even been a hint of scandal. Not a hint.\" \u2014 Jeremy Newberger (@jeremynewberger) October 23, 2019\n\nIt appears Whitaker is the best \u2066@realDonaldTrump\u2069 can do in terms of defenders right now. pic.twitter.com/yGfts3xoxa \u2014 Andrew Feinberg (@AndrewFeinberg) October 23, 2019", "description": "Former acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker offered up an unexpected defense of Trump in a Fox News interview with Laura Ingraham on Tuesday night.", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HC850_whitak_ZG_20190128182926.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
