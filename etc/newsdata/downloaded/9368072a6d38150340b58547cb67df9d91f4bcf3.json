Photo: Netflix\n\nIn the run-up to today\u2019s world premiere of Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman, speculation understandably focused on the extensive de-aging technology used to transform Robert De Niro (current age: 76), Al Pacino (current age: 79), Joe Pesci (current age: 76), and some other members of the cast into younger versions of themselves throughout the film. Truth be told, many of us were worried \u2014 especially after some brief advance footage and a not-very-good trailer revealed a \u201cyoung\u201d De Niro with an eerily smooth sheen on his face.\n\nSo, how was the de-aging in The Irishman? It is, on one level, incredibly impressive \u2013 this isn\u2019t just Young Jeff Bridges seen amid dark shadows in Tron: Legacy, or Young Carrie Fisher showing up briefly at the end of Rogue One. A good chunk of this three-and-a-half-hour epic (I\u2019m not here to review the movie, but let the record state that I loved this movie) takes place between actors who are in reality nowhere near the ages they\u2019re playing. One marvels at all the effort it must have taken to make this even remotely possible. That\u2019s not just a technological accomplishment; it\u2019s a strategic stroke of brilliance: So much of The Irishman involves de-aging that even if you\u2019re not entirely on board with how these actors look, after a while you just kind of stop noticing, or at least minding. It might have been more problematic if you were watching a two-hour film that had, say, 20 or 30 minutes of shiny-faced de-aged actors.\n\nBecause yes, the actors do often still have that weird sheen on their faces. Especially De Niro. Perhaps because he\u2019s playing a somewhat passive character \u2014 a guy who basically does what he\u2019s told, and keeps quiet \u2014 so most of the time we\u2019re focused on the tense, submerged expression on his face. By contrast, Al Pacino\u2019s performance as Jimmy Hoffa is so broad \u2014 wild gestures, angry bellows with sharp detours into whispered asides, and oddly emphasized words \u2014 that you never really worry about whether the lines on his face seem too smooth or unreal. His whole presence is unreal, probably because he\u2019s playing one of American history\u2019s great larger-than-life figures.\n\nA de-aged Al Pacino.

Especially for an audience that remembers what a young Robert De Niro did look like, and sound like, and move like. This issue of movement is something that Scorsese and his team were clearly aware of: At the post-film press conference, he and Al Pacino told a story about shooting a scene in which Pacino had to get up from his chair during an angry tirade about John F. Kennedy. Scorsese said he did a couple of takes, both of which looked great, and was ready to move on when his camera people and technical advisers reminded him that the 79-year-old Pacino\u2019s character was supposed to be 49 in the scene. So the actor had to do the whole scene again, making sure to move like a much younger man. (\u201c62!\u201d they said after the next take. He got closer after that.)\n\nThere is something very poignant about all this, particularly in the case of De Niro, who in his heyday was an actor with a mythically powerful physical presence. When we imitate a Robert De Niro performance \u2014 and admit it, you and I both have \u2014 we imagine not just a voice and a face, but a series of gestures and steps and movements. Think of the whipsawing energy of Taxi Driver\u2019s Travis Bickle, moody and reflective one minute, anxious and menacing the next. Think of the way his Jimmy Conway destroys that phone in Goodfellas (or the way he menacingly invites Lorraine Bracco to just mosey on down a dark alley to pick up some bootleg goods). Or those manic, adorable/creepy shoulder shrugs of The King of Comedy. Or the way he wields that baseball bat and puffs up his chest in The Untouchables. As he\u2019s gotten older, De Niro has, like all humans, lost that versatility of movement, which has softened his unpredictability and intensity. Maybe this is why he often disappoints us. But it\u2019s also why, in the right part, he can still shine, as he did in The Intern, and Silver Linings Playbook, and (fuck you) Dirty Grandpa.\n\nRobert De Niro \u2014 wrinkles, scowl and all. Photo: Netflix\n\nThe Irishman uses this very mortal limitation to its artistic advantage. It turns De Niro\u2019s age and slowness into an existential ethos: Scorsese\u2019s film is framed very much as the memories of an old man looking back on a life of violence and regrets \u2014 De Niro\u2019s character sits in a wheelchair in a nursing home, mostly unresponsive, in the opening scene \u2014 it makes sense that the film\u2019s version of \u201cyoung\u201d De Niro exists in this neither-here-nor-there space somewhere between youth and old age. This mimics the way memory often works: When we remember incidents from earlier in our lives, we imagine ourselves as younger versions of the people we are now, instead of the people we really were back then. As has already been memed to death, De Niro in The Irishman carries the same glower throughout the film, whether he\u2019s a young man executing Nazis in World War II, a middle-aged man doing mob hits, or a geriatric man reflecting on his joyless, loveless, empty life. That\u2019s sort of the point of the film.\n\nAdmittedly, this might have been a response on Scorsese\u2019s part to technology that didn\u2019t quite land where he initially hoped he would. But I\u2019d argue that seeing the real Young Robert De Niro \u2014 the twitchy live-wire of Mean Streets, or the muscle-bound steamroller of Raging Bull \u2014 would have romanticized the character too much, threatening to undo Scorsese\u2019s intentions here. He\u2019s making a movie about a sad, old, impoverished world. The Irishman in that sense could be seen as the opposite of this summer\u2019s The Lion King remake, which had mind-blowing effects that ultimately wound up working against the film\u2019s emotional effect. It was technologically dazzling, but ultimately lifeless. The effects in The Irishman are far from perfect, but they actually help give the movie its soul.", "description": "The effects in Martin Scorsese\u2019s movie, starring de-aged Robert De Nior and Al Pacino, are far from perfect, but \u2014 unlike those of this year\u2019s Lion King remake \u2014 they actually help give the movie its soul.", "authors": ["Bilge Ebiri"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/27/the-irishman/27-the-irishman-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
