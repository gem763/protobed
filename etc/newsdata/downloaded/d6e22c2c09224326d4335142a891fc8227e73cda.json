But it's the inventor Nikola Tesla who should have been more famous for his inventions than history has awarded.\n\nTesla was a scientist and visionary who developed the basis for AC electric power that most of the planet uses today and pioneered numerous technologies that improve our everyday lives. A Serbian-American who emigrated to New York City in 1884, Tesla held approximately 300 patents.\n\n\"There's not a lot of modern conveniences that we currently enjoy that weren't touched by Nikola Tesla in some way,\" said Marc Alessi, executive director of the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe in New York, where teams are refurbishing Tesla's lab into a museum and innovation hub.\n\nNikola Tesla's lab at Wardenclyffe in New York, which is being transformed into a science, education, and technology center.\n\n\"If Tesla didn't accelerate the AC current system, we would be 50 years behind technologically than where we are today.\"\n\nBut it's not just AC power that Tesla worked on. Motors, radios, X-rays, neon signs and other technology was advanced by his extraordinary mind. We take a look at the most famous and important inventions that Nikola Tesla contributed to.\n\nAlternating current\n\nThis is the Tesla technology that sparked a war with Edison, the developer of direct current, and it's the subject of the new film.\n\nBack in 1884, Tesla left Europe to work for Edison, who supposedly promised him $50,000 to fix the problems with DC power. Meanwhile, Tesla's alternating current had fewer issues. With AC power, the current is reversed numerous times per second, making it easy to convert to higher and lower voltages.\n\n\"He was working 20 hour days, and the whole time he was saying 'let's switch to AC current, it will work better,' \" Alessi told CNN. But Edison never paid him the money, and claimed the promise was a joke. \"Tesla quit and he ended up in a battle with Edison,\" Alessi said.\n\nInventor and physicist Thomas Edison (1847 - 1931) looking at a lightbulb (Photo by Nathan Lazarnick/George Eastman House/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to the US Department of Energy, Edison did not want to lose royalties he was earning from his DC patents, so he attempted to discredit Tesla's AC power through a misinformation campaign that touted alternating current as dangerous. Edison even publicly electrocuted stray animals using AC power as a scare tactic. Tesla countered by publicly shocking himself with 250,000 volts using alternating current to showcase its safety.\n\nBut Tesla had the last laugh, because today, alternating current is predominantly used to power most of the world's electricity.\n\nAC motors are also used in refrigerators, power tools and fans. Meanwhile, DC motors are still used for some industrial machines and conveyors, but often require more maintenance.\n\nRadio\n\nHistory often touts Italian entrepreneur Guglielmo Marconi as the inventor of radio. But sometimes history is wrong.\n\nMarconi is credited with sending the first transatlantic radio transmission, using technology from 17 of Tesla's patents.\n\nThe two inventors became embroiled in a patent war. In fact, the United States Supreme Court revoked Marconi's radio patents in 1943 in favor of Tesla and two other scientists, Oliver Lodge and John Stone. Unfortunately, Tesla and Marconi had already passed away by the time the court handed down their decision.\n\nItalian electrical engineer and nobel laureate Guglielmo Marconi with the one of his wireless radio apparatuses.

He experimented with radiation and managed to take some of the first X-ray images of the human body, which he called \"shadowgraphs.\" Tesla was also one of the first scientists to hypothesize that X-rays could be harmful.\n\nBut this is another area of research where he rarely gets credit.\n\nAccording to one 2008 academic article published in RadioGraphics , \"Every radiologist is aware of Nikola Tesla's research in the field of electromagnetism ... but if the discovery of X-rays is mentioned, only a few radiologists associate it with Tesla's name.\"\n\nNikola Tesla demonstrates an experiment in his New York City lab in 1895.\n\nTesla contributed to medicine in other ways as well. The unit of energy named after Tesla is used to measure the strength of the magnets in MRI systems.\n\nHydroelectric power\n\nTesla was also a pioneer of renewable energy. Nine out of the 12 patents used to build one of the world's first hydroelectric stations, erected at Niagara Falls, New York belonged to Tesla.\n\n\"As a child, when his uncle read him a book about Niagara Falls, the first thing he thought was about energy. \"That water falling is energy,\" explained Alessi. \"At the dawn of our using fossil fuels for the industrial revolution, Tesla was already saying 'That's not the way we should go. That's dirty and finite.' \"\n\nPart of the American portion of Niagara Falls, New York, where Tesla harnessed the power of the water to create one of the worl's first hydroelectric power stations, The Adams Plant.

Experts say he wanted to bring safe electric power to the masses -- to make factory worker's lives easier at work, and light up worker's homes so they study in the evenings to improve themselves.\n\n\"He loved the technology and what it could do,\" said Alessi. \"Tesla would be willing to lose money if it would help people.\"", "description": "Nikola Tesla -- you might recognize the name because of the car brand named after him -- was a scientist and visionary who developed the basis for AC power and pioneered numerous technologies that improve our everyday lives.", "authors": ["Lauren Kent"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120821143405-nikola-tesla-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
