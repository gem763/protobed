Here are their plans to upend the $3.5 trillion industry.\n\nWedbush also raised concerns about Best Buy's long-term growth targets.\n\nBest Buy has benefitted in recent years from the closure or weakening of rivals such as Radio Shack, Circuit City, and Sears, the Wedbush analysts wrote.\n\nBut \"there are few remaining vulnerable brick-and-mortar retailers who are in danger of losing share to Best Buy, and we don't think that the core market for the company's product offering is growing nearly as fast as its five-year forecast suggests,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nIn summary, the analysts added, \"The management team is doing everything right, but faces a difficult situation with a mature core product offering and intense competition from online retail.\"", "description": "Best Buy is making a massive best on the aging population of the US with a suite of health services and devices.", "authors": ["Hayley Peterson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/548752afeab8ea49519000d6-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
