I'd say they get pizzas delivered and all that. But to be honest, that doesn't happen.\n\n'You eat rice and beans. The showering is cold shower. Bathroom situation is you basically poo in a bucket and I had to empty that. So after (fellow camp mate) Edwina Currie had eaten a curry - emptying the toilet - it's curry by name, curry by nature.'\n\nSavage: Jake was quick to tell Kate that she would be 'pooing in a bucket' as he reflected on the famous 'dunny'\n\nCheeky: Kate was also left flustered when a clip of Jake's Hollyoaks' debut was played which showed him going shirtless in just a high-vis vest\n\nAs they descended into hysterical laughter, Ben added: 'We've had a lot of people coming on talking about it but no one has ever been this blunt with Kate.'\n\nHowever Jake did have some positive words for Kate, adding: 'If somebody was to go in, I would tell them it is the best experience I have ever had.'\n\nJake was standing in for Richard Arnold as Good Morning Britain's showbiz correspondant, and also spoke his soap debut in Hollyoaks, which will air on Channel 4 on Thursday night.\n\nThe X Factor star is set to play Woody, a hunky builder who gets caught up in a dramatic stunt when a tunnel collapses leaving several residents trapped.\n\nFlustered: She appeared to get a bit hot under the collar watching Jake during the clip\n\nTogether: Kate once again hosted the show with Ben Shephard, as they stand in for Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid during the half term break\n\nDuring GMB a clip of Jake's first scene was shown with the hunk going shirtless in just a high-vis vest and hard hat.\n\nThe clip left Kate in a complete fluster as she gushed: 'Never mind Magic Mike! Can I just say, you are building to some sort of stripping role. You have a super slow-mo going on.'\n\nSpeaking about his new soap role Jake added: 'He's been dragged in by Cindy to start work on a restaurant and he is a bit of a rogue, he's not really bothered about health and safety.'\n\nHollyoaks airs weeknights at 6.30pm on Channel 4, with first look screenings at 7pm on E4. Good Morning airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.", "description": "The presenter was left in hysterics by the revelation on Thursday's Good Morning Britain just minutes after getting hot under the collar as she watched a clip of Jake in his Hollyoaks debut.", "authors": ["Laura Fox For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/14/20129694-0-image-a-126_1571925501483.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
