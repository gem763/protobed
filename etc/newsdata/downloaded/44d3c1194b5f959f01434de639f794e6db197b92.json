She\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s assessment came amid the ongoing feud between Clinton and Gabbard, which was sparked by comments the former first lady made last week.\n\nAppearing on former Obama aide David Plouffe\u2019s \u201cCampaign HQ\u201d podcast, Clinton did not mention Gabbard specifically by name, though Plouffe ended the podcast by noting Clinton\u2019s \u201cbelief that Tulsi Gabbard is going to be a third-party candidate propped up by Trump and the Russians.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm not making any predictions but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said, in an apparent reference to Gabbard. \u201cShe's the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nShe then accused Stein, who ran against her and Donald Trump in 2016, of also being an asset of Russia: \u201cThat\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she\u2019s also a Russian asset.\u201d\n\n2020 DEMS DISMISS HILLARY CLINTON'S ATTACKS, RALLY TO TULSI HABBARD'S DEFENSE OVER RUSSIA ACCUSATION\n\nOther Democrats have made similar claims about Gabbard, a Hawaii congresswoman and Hawaii Army National Guard major who served in Iraq.Gabbard -- as well as other prominent Democrats -- have slammed Clinton for the comments.\n\n\u201cTulsi is not being groomed by anyone. She is her own person,\u201d former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke said over the weekend.\n\nTrump said he doesn't know Gabbard or Stein personally, but dismissed the allegations against both women.\n\n\"I don't know Jill Stein. I know her as an environmentalist and probably a good woman. The last thing she is is a Russian asset. I don't know Tulsi Gabbard, but I know one thing: she's not an asset of Russia. These people are sick. There's something wrong with them,\" Trump told Hannity.\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang defended Gabbard in a tweet, writing she \u201cdeserves much more respect and thanks than this. She literally just got back from serving our country abroad.\u201d\n\nHILLARY CLINTON FLOATS CONSPIRACY THAT TULSI GABBARD IS BEING 'GROOMED' BY RUSSIANS\n\n\u201cThe Democratic establishment has got to stop smearing women it finds inconvenient!\u201d Marianne Williamson, the self-help author, tweeted. \u201cThe character assassination of women who don\u2019t toe the party line will backfire. Stay strong @TulsiGabbard. You deserve respect and you have mine.\u201d\n\nSouth Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, also a veteran, was asked on CNN whether he felt Gabbard was a Russian asset and said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the basis is for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer to have the conversation be about policy, about what we\u2019re going to do, and about how American lives are going to be different,\u201d Buttigieg said Sunday. \u201cWhen it comes to any of my Democratic competitors, that\u2019s my focus, making sure that we make very clear the differences -- and there are very real differences among us\u2014and making it clear to voters what their choices are. That\u2019s where I\u2019d like the focus to be.\u201d\n\nTULSI GABBARD SLAMS CRITICS DURING DEBATE OVER 'DESPICABLE' 'SMEARS' OVER SYRIA, RUSSIA\n\nMeanwhile, Gabbard herself posted a video message over the weekend claiming Clinton\u2019s accusation was simply payback for her defiance of the party establishment during the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIf they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone\u2014and in fact, that\u2019s exactly the message they want to get across to you,\u201d Gabbard said in the video. \u201cIf you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers\u2014if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cBut, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.\u201d\n\nDuring his exclusive interview on \u201cHannity\u201d Monday, Trump also said he hoped Attorney General William Barr would look into potential ties between Ukraine, Clinton and the controversial anti-Trump dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele.\n\n\u201cYou hear about Ukraine, and you\u2019ve been hearing about it. I heard Clinton was involved,\u201d the president said.\n\nMULVANEY INSISTS NO QUID PRO QUO WITH UKRAINE AFTER WHITE HOUSE COMMENTS\n\n\u201cI heard they got somebody who wrote the fake dossier was out of Ukraine. All of the things that happened.\n\n\u201cAnd, I assume that the attorney general -- I would like the attorney general to find out what\u2019s going on. Because, you know what? We are investigating corruption.\u201d\n\nTrump has continued to face criticism over allegations he temporarily delayed $391 million in aid in order to leverage Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating potential Ukrainian involvement with Democrats during the 2016 election.\n\nThe investigation request was part of a phone call between the two world leaders, but both Trump and Zelensky have insisted there was no pressure involved.\n\nThe call was the basis for an anonymous whistleblower complaint that sparked House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry that has included several closed-door interviews with officials related to U.S.-Ukraine relations.\n\nThe complaint also alleged that Trump wanted Ukraine to help the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHouse Democrats have been looking into whether the president engaged in a political quid pro quo when he asked the new Ukraine president to do a \"favor\u201d during the controversial conversation.\n\nIt is illegal to solicit or receive anything of value from a foreign entity in U.S. elections.\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman and Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump reignited his feud with Hillary Clinton, taking aim at his 2016 rival for her recent comments about Democratic presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard.", "authors": ["Liam Quinn", "Liam Quinn Is A Senior Editor At Fox News.
