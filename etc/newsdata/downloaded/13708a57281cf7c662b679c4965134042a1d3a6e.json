This is different\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "The pioneering musician was raised among gangsters and has battled with anxiety, as documented in his new memoir. But nothing could prepare him for the grief of losing his daughter this year\n\nUntil recently, Tricky had a picture of his mother as the screensaver on his phone. He never got to know her properly \u2013 she killed herself when he was just four years old \u2013 but he had gone through life believing that she was out there, somewhere, keeping an eye on him.\n\n\u201cAnd I did believe that,\u201d he says. \u201cUntil 8 May this year. Because that was the day my world ended. So if she was supposed to be looking after me, what the fuck\u2019s happened?\u201d\n\nThe date he is referring to is the day his daughter Mazy \u2013 also known as Mina \u2013 died at the age of 24 (there is currently an ongoing NHS trust inquiry into the cause). At the time of her death, Tricky put out a brief statement saying: \u201cI thought I knew what loss was, but now my daughter is gone I realise I had no idea what it was after all.\u201d\n\nToday, several months on, he still sounds utterly bereft: \u201cI\u2019ve lost my belief,\u201d he says at one point. \u201cHopefully I will get it back.\u201d\n\nHe is here to talk about his autobiography, and you wouldn\u2019t, on the surface, know that he was grieving. We are sitting at an outdoor bar alongside Regent\u2019s canal in north London. Tricky is drinking \u201cwater with bubbles\u201d and smoking rollups. He is outgoing, cheeky and full of warmth. He speaks with a thick Bristolian burr, loudly and quickly, a surprise to people who have heard his music \u2013 which can be dark and claustrophobic \u2013 and expect a moody personality to match.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tricky as a child in Bristol. Photograph: Courtesy of Tricky\n\nThe memoir charts Tricky\u2019s unlikely rise from young Bristol tearaway to one of British music\u2019s most creative visionaries. His hushed style of rapping, unusual production methods and ability to reconstruct soul, punk, reggae and hip-hop into strange new shapes has long left critics scrabbling for words to define his 13-album career. He hates being called \u201cthe godfather of trip-hop\u201d \u2013 hates the phrase \u201ctrip-hop\u201d, in fact \u2013 but it is probably as close as you will get to a neat label and it is hard to argue with.\n\nTricky shaped the sound of Massive Attack\u2019s landmark 1991 album Blue Lines, and four years later \u2013 thanks in part to the beguiling vocals of his then partner and the mother of Mazy, Martina Topley-Bird \u2013 changed the face of pop with his baffling, beautiful debut solo album, Maxinquaye, named after his mother.\n\nThe book\u2019s title \u2013 Hell Is Round the Corner \u2013 is taken from a track on Maxinquaye, and it aptly describes a life in which violence and tragedy have lurked beside every success story. Born Adrian Thaws and raised in Bristol by his grandmother and aunties, Tricky had a happy, but unconventional, childhood: food often consisted of rabbit stew sourced from the family\u2019s poaching expeditions; criminality was an accepted way of life.\n\nWithout his musical gift, Tricky\u2019s prospects would not have looked bright: \u201cWhere I come from, a lot of people are either on drugs, in prison or dead,\u201d he says. His uncles were gangsters and Tricky grew up noticing how people would treat him differently whenever their names were dropped: his food in a curry house would be upgraded; the atmosphere in a pub might suddenly change.\n\n\u201cOnce, I asked my auntie why everyone was scared of my uncle Martin,\u201d he says. \u201cShe said: \u2018Because if he says he\u2019s going to cut your throat, he\u2019ll cut your throat.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe saw unimaginable violence from a young age. Several social workers, including his other daughter, Marie, have read his book, and told him that the way he was brought up would, in their professional eyes, count as neglect.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Massive Attack with Tricky in concert, SOBs, New York City, 30 October 1991.

He loved life in Bristol\u2019s Knowle West, a tough, predominantly white neighbourhood, and says his upbringing was full of affection. Still, you can see where the social workers are coming from. His grandmother would often say things like: \u201c\u2018Oh, it\u2019s cold today, you don\u2019t wanna go school, stay at home with me.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe would also tell him to always empty his pockets before going out, in case he accidentally left something behind at a crime scene. \u201cWhat I consider normal ain\u2019t really normal,\u201d he concedes.\n\nPerhaps the most startling example of this in the book is when he introduces a character from his youth as a \u201clovely guy\u201d and then, a paragraph or so later, breezily mentions that said character had also shot someone in the neck. Tricky pauses when I mention this, as if trying to work out who I\u2019m on about. Then he breaks out in an explosion of affection: \u201cOh, Wayney Lomas! Yeah! Aw, Wayney was a brilliant guy! But yeah, he got found with his head chopped off. They shot him in the head, in his house, then took his body, chopped him up and put him in a concrete floor.\u201d\n\nEr \u2026 who did?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tricky\u2019s mum, Maxinquaye. Photograph: Courtesy of Tricky\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know who did it. But he was a lovely, lovely guy. But yeah, he\u2019d shot someone in the neck, apparently.\u201d\n\nHe checks my startled reaction to this tale and laughs. Is it any wonder, he says, that his music can sound dark to some people? Darkness is what he has always known. His first memory is peeking into his mum\u2019s coffin while it was resting in the family home before burial. Didn\u2019t that mess with his head a bit? \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be a great thing, would it?\u201d\n\nThe men in his life were tough guys, but the women who raised him were tougher. He saw his grandmother and aunties street-fight like his uncles (\u201cThe fighting was more vicious, cos men care more about their ego\u201d) and observed them being strong in other ways, too: running the household and feeding the family while the men were away doing time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve a kinship with women,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve always put women in strong positions in music.\u201d\n\nTopley-Bird was the most important of these. He met her by sheer luck in about 1992 \u2013 she had been singing with schoolfriends outside his house. A few years later, they became a couple and had Mazy together; the relationship didn\u2019t last, but they continued to collaborate musically on several more albums.\n\nThat music as restless and ruthlessly experimental as Tricky\u2019s found commercial success is perhaps surprising, not least to him. He expected to be an underground producer \u2013 instead Maxinquaye went to No 3, and was followed by a string of Top 40 albums. His sound became hugely influential and he was sought after by everyone from David Bowie to U2. Everyone wanted to be associated with him \u2013 even Samantha Cameron claimed to have spent time hanging out with him while she was at university in Bristol (Tricky has always remained sceptical of this, saying he has no recollection of her).\n\nBut he didn\u2019t enjoy being in the limelight. A tempestuous relationship with Bj\u00f6rk turned him into a tabloid fixture for a while, and he increasingly tried to self-sabotage his career. One time, in New York, he failed to turn up to a meeting in his hotel with Madonna because he wanted to sleep instead. He was also terrible when it came to money. He knows that he once owned a house in New Jersey with acres of land around it, but he can\u2019t remember where exactly it was, how it got sold or where the cash went.\n\nHis mental state wasn\u2019t helped by the amount of weed he was smoking, while he believes candida \u2013 a yeast infection rarely taken seriously by conventional doctors \u2013 was largely responsible for some of his more erratic behaviour. Even without these problems, the spotlight of fame didn\u2019t suit him. His subdued rapping style comes, he says, from shyness; the same goes for his live shows, which use minimal stage lighting: \u201cIt\u2019s all lack of confidence\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tribute video released by Tricky after his daughter\u2019s death.\n\nThis proved to be an issue in 2011, when Tricky was invited by Beyonc\u00e9 to appear as a guest vocalist for her headline set at Glastonbury. He says he wanted to say no, but his manager insisted, so he wrote a verse to perform during her song Baby Boy. When he got on stage and saw the lights, huge crowd and celebrity faces \u2013 Chris Martin, Jay Z \u2013 staring back at him, he froze. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready for it \u2026 it was too much,\u201d he says. \u201cI told the press that my mic wasn\u2019t working, but it was working fine.\u201d\n\nAnxiety has sometimes overcome him in more destructive ways. In his book, he talks about living in Los Angeles in the 00s, when he would keep an Uzisubmachine gun underneath his bed for protection. Would he have been prepared to use it?\n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t bad-guy talk, cos I\u2019m not a bad guy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut people don\u2019t realise what fear can do. I\u2019ve had situations where I\u2019ve been so scared, where I can\u2019t sleep, I can\u2019t eat, and it\u2019s gone on for weeks and it\u2019s ruining my life. It makes you sick, it makes you mentally ill.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nanny Violet. Photograph: Courtesy of Tricky\n\nHe continues: \u201cSo I had this person \u2013 I can\u2019t tell you who \u2013 on my mind day and night. And there was a chance I could bump into them. My mate brought me over some gloves, a different gun, and I had to polish the bullets so you don\u2019t leave your finger prints on them. And then I went out in the car, to see if we were going to bump into each other.\u201d\n\nHe notices my eyes widening \u2013 not for the first time today. \u201cFear can be very dangerous. You should never make someone too scared of you.\u201d\n\nProcessing emotions has never been easy for Tricky. He admits he was a terrible, absent boyfriend to Bj\u00f6rk. She apparently told him he was \u201cemotionally numb\u201d. And it is true that, throughout the book, there is a sense of indifference to some of the people and situations in his life.\n\nBut it is striking how Tricky shakes off that detachment whenever he writes about Mazy. When talking about her, he is anything but emotionally numb: he recounts with love taking her on Australian tours (where she was babysat by Perry Farrell of Jane\u2019s Addiction, of all people), and buying that house in the New Jersey wilderness so she could play safely away from the New York streets. His adoration for her is so clear and, now, so heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest problems with my daughter is that I\u2019ve never loved anybody that much before,\u201d he says. \u201cI was there at her birth. And all of a sudden I started feeling things. And it was too much for me. Because I was emotionally numb, and it was easier for me to get through life being emotionally numb, but then suddenly I was feeling things.\u201d\n\nHe tries to explain how he\u2019s feeling now. \u201cI\u2019ve lost people before, like grandmothers, but I\u2019ve bounced back,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is different. Everything looks different, even music doesn\u2019t sound the same. I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. I was in Islington yesterday and I was hoping I was going to see her, hoping she\u2019s gonna walk up to me.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tricky, AKA Adrian Nicholas Matthews Thaws. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nI ask how he is coping, and he says therapy. \u201cIt\u2019s good. Like, really good.\u201d But getting through each day is tough. He says there is a girl in his apartment building in Berlin, where he lives, who is the spitting image of Mazy. When she was alive, he even connected the pair of them on FaceTime, just to freak them both out. \u201cAnd now, when I see her, it\u2019s like: \u2018Whoa!\u2019\u201d\n\nMazy was a musician herself, and Tricky has plans to work on some of the songs she left behind. He already has two tracks that he wants to put on his next album. There are other things, too, that give him hope. Like the time a \u201cwhite ghetto dude\u201d stopped him in Notting Hill and said: \u201cYour music got me through prison.\u201d Or the moment a young Texan revealed that his family had played Tricky\u2019s music to him while he was in a coma. Then there\u2019s the nurse in a Chicago burns unit who told his drummer they played his music to the kids there. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew: \u2018This ain\u2019t just about me,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nHe has been thinking of these stories a lot recently. About how others have found something in his music that has got them through.\n\n\u201cI never thought of my music as dark,\u201d he says before we part. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that dark to get people through a dark period, can it?\u201d\n\nHe gives me a huge embrace before he leaves, an acknowledgement that it has been a difficult conversation for him. He is going through unimaginable darkness right now, but hopefully he, too, can find some light.\n\nHell Is Round the Corner is published by Blink on 31 October. Tricky will be in conversation at the Royal Festival Hall, South Bank Centre, London, on 26 October.", "description": "The pioneering musician was raised among gangsters and has battled with anxiety, as documented in his new memoir.
