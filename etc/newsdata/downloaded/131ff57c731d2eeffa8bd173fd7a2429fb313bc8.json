The Nations League contenders have yet to be confirmed, but Scotland will meet Serbia or Norway or either Israel or Bulgaria, depending on the outcome of the tournament\u2019s tortuous elimination process.\n\nIn the meantime, Clarke will focus on the tattered remnants of the Scots\u2019 Euro 2020 campaign, beginning with Thursday\u2019s meeting with Russia in the Luzhniki Stadium and the visit of San Marino to Hampden Park next Sunday, followed by Cyprus away and Kazakhstan at home in November.\n\nClarke was hailed as the people\u2019s choice when he succeeded Alex McLeish in May but he has so far been unable to arrest a deeply dispiriting slump which began with humiliation by the Kazakhs in Astana.\n\nAccording to HMRC, sales of Scotch reached a record high of \u00a33 billion in the first half of this year. We need not look far for the cause. The Tartan Army\u2019s need of a general anaesthetic is explained by the Group I table, currently led by Belgium, followed by Russia, Kazakhstan and Cyprus.\n\nSan Marino, the section makeweights, are bottom but, if one excludes the microstate whose population equals that of Dumfries (33,000), then the Scottish record makes pitiable reading \u2013 one scrabbled win away to the Sammarinese and another at home to Cyprus. Clarke\u2019s task, if he is to retain credibility amongst a battered support, is to finish best of the stragglers.", "description": "As he looks to the Nations League play-offs that represent Scotland\u2019s only chance of competing in the Euro 2020 finals \u2013 during which Hampden Park will host four ties \u2013 Steve Clarke will not experiment or add friendlies to the Scots\u2019 schedule between now and March.", "authors": ["Roddy Forsyth", "Scottish Football Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000208603672-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqEXEAsywcpHbOWpOveeDQc7KAPxgvQjLeVYwUS0X096g.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
