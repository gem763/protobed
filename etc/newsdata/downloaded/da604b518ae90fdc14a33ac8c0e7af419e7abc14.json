Barr testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee in May. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nWilliam P. Barr penned a strong endorsement of a book published in 2017 that alleges colleges were unfairly finding students guilty of sexual misconduct amid a national outcry about campus rape.\n\nIn a blurb written before President Trump nominated him to serve as attorney general, Barr said \u201cThe Campus Rape Frenzy: The Attack on Due Process at America\u2019s Universities\u201d was a \u201cmasterful account\u201d of how the Obama administration had promoted a false narrative of rape culture on college campuses.\n\n\u201cYour blood will boil as the authors meticulously examine scores of cases where, in the name of political correctness, male students are sacrificed to the mob, with academic leaders happily serving as the hangmen,\u201d Barr wrote in a blurb for the Kindle edition of the book, sold by Amazon. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nBarr also praised the book by KC Johnson and Stuart Taylor Jr. for its critique of President Barack Obama\u2019s Education Department, which Barr said \u201ccreated a regime of kangaroo justice.\u201d Male students\u2019 lives were being destroyed by accusations of sexual misconduct without adequate evidence, Barr wrote in the blurb, first reported by NBC News.\n\n[The true story behind \u2018Unbelievable,\u2019 Netflix\u2019s gripping new drama about the women who solved a serial rape case]\n\nThe emergence of Barr\u2019s praise of the book comes the same week Trump suggested the Justice Department \u201crescue\u201d Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh from new allegations that he exposed himself to a female student at a dorm party while attending Yale University. The Justice Department does not handle most sexual assault investigations, though it does prosecute sex trafficking and child sexual exploitation.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Barr\u2019s endorsement of \u201cThe Campus Rape Frenzy.\u201d\n\nNadine Strossen, a professor at New York Law School and a former president of the American Civil Liberties Union, also endorsed the book when it was first published. Dorothy Rabinowitz, a member of the Wall Street Journal editorial board, and Alan Charles Kors, a professor emeritus of history at the University of Pennsylvania, endorsed a later edition.\n\nJohnson told The Post that he and Taylor asked Barr to endorse their book because he previously had written a blurb for another of their books, \u201cUntil Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case.\u201d Barr called that book \u201ca gripping, meticulous, blow-by-blow account of the whole grotesque affair ... exposing how vulnerable the prosecutorial system is to abuse and how ready the liberal media and PC academics are to serve as leaders of the lynch mob.\u201d\n\nThe authors sought endorsements for \u201cThe Campus Rape Frenzy\u201d from legal minds on both sides of the ideological spectrum because they wanted to make the point that fair treatment of defendants should concern people of all political persuasions, Johnson said. Barr\u2019s endorsement, Johnson said, \u201cshows that he\u2019s at least not indifferent to civil liberties.\u201d\n\n[Trump defends \u2018brilliant\u2019 Kavanaugh, says New York Times should \u2018close its doors\u2019 over sexual misconduct report]\n\n\u201cTo the extent that he is agreeing with the argument of the book, the basic argument is that adjudications need to be fair and that the rights of everyone need to be respected,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThere is nothing in the book that suggests that universities should not take sexual assault seriously.\u201d\n\nIn December 2018, Trump announced that he was nominating Barr as attorney general, replacing Jeff Sessions. Senate confirmation hearings were held in February, and Barr was confirmed by the full Senate on Feb. 14. It is his second stint as attorney general, having served in the George H.W. Bush administration.\n\nTom Mentzer, a spokesman for Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the Democrats did not know about the blurb at the time of Barr\u2019s confirmation hearings. A spokesperson for the committee\u2019s Republicans did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince \u201cThe Campus Rape Frenzy\u201d published, Trump\u2019s Education Department has sought to roll back Obama-era rules that outlined how K-12 schools and colleges had to respond to sexual assault allegations. The Obama administration said at the time that the 2011 guidance was merely clarification of the obligations schools already had under Title IX, which bars sex discrimination at federally funded schools. Critics said the guidance encouraged colleges to brand innocent students as rapists.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos has proposed a new rule that she said would restore balance between the rights of the accusers and the accused. The rule, proposed last year, narrows the definition of sexual harassment, decreases the cases that schools must investigate, allows colleges to create a higher legal standard for finding a student guilty and codifies certain rights for the accused.\n\nRead more:\n\nSenate panel headed for clash over several diplomatic and development nominees\n\nDemocrats dubious of Trump administration\u2019s push to renew controversial spy power\n\nJeffrey Epstein\u2019s alleged abuse of teenage girl detailed in lawsuit against his estate executors\n\nMcCabe\u2019s legal team says Trump\u2019s attacks have made fair prosecution an \u2018impossibility\u2019", "description": "\"The Campus Rape Frenzy\" argues that defendants in college cases are being denied fair treatment and the presumption of innocence.", "authors": ["Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter", "September At Pm", "Marisa Iati Is A Reporter For The General Assignment News Desk", "The Metro Desk.
