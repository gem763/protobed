Not strange in the sense that it had a virtual koi fish assistant, or that it resembled a boxy, Blade Runner-y sedan, or that it sings. No, the new Nissan Ariya concept is strange because of how normal it looks. For the first time in a few years, you can look at the newest Nissan concept and get a real sense of what the company might do with an electric car that isn\u2019t the Leaf.\n\nThat\u2019s on the design side, at least. Nissan didn\u2019t tease too many technical details with the Ariya, save for saying that it was designed to be powered by a twin electric motor setup that will enable all-wheel drive performance. (Which, personally, I find sort of ironic considering the automaker\u2019s team in all-electric racing series Formula E got twin-motor setups banned from the series after quietly using one this past season.)\n\nThe Ariya is more about where Nissan wants its design language to go\n\nAs far as the look of the car goes, the Ariya doesn\u2019t feel too far off from something that could go into production next year. It\u2019s a crossover SUV, so it\u2019s on the smaller side, and it most closely resembles the Jaguar I-Pace. Meanwhile, the two-toned look and the thin, aggressive headlights recall the designs employed by startups like Byton or Faraday Future.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ariya has a relatively simple interior, with a big 12.3-inch horizontal display that stretches from behind the steering wheel out to the center of the dashboard. Nissan boasts about having almost no physical buttons in its press release, save for a knob that would be used to navigate the infotainment system and vehicle settings on the display. For the climate controls, there\u2019s a row of touch-sensitive icons on the lower part of the dashboard that have haptic feedback.\n\nThere are some other smart car touches on the Ariya, like how the concept car will recognize the driver\u2019s smartphone and automatically adjust settings to their liking, or how the vehicle is equipped with Nissan\u2019s most advanced version of its ProPilot driver assistance system. If you could knock the Ariya for anything, it\u2019s that it\u2019s not the most memorable car because of how normal it looks (save for, perhaps, those wheels).\n\nBut the most stunning thing about the Ariya is that, this time at least, Nissan dropped the gimmicks and rolled out a reasonable vehicle that we may very well see in production form someday soon. For those who have been waiting for the Japanese automaker to start talking about a follow to the Leaf (which has been a successful car in its own right), the Ariya looks like the beginning of that conversation.", "description": "Nissan unveiled a new electric concept car this week at the 2019 Tokyo Motor Show called the Ariya.
