He was left bleeding on the street and was later pronounced dead.\n\nPolice released security footage they said shows Kreiter-Rhoads running through the neighborhood on the night of the slaying, Freitas confirmed to HuffPost.\n\nPolice also released security footage of Singh walking in his neighborhood just before he was attacked.\n\nDetectives searched Kreiter-Rhoads\u2019 residence when he was arrested, but didn\u2019t reveal what they discovered. Kreiter-Rhoads is scheduled to be arraigned on Wednesday, CBS Sacramento reported.\n\nTracy Police Department A photo provided by the Tracy Police Department shows Anthony Kreiter-Rhoads, who is suspected of killing Parmjit Singh.\n\nThe homicide has stunned members of the local gurdwara, or Sikh temple, where Singh was an active member. Hundreds gathered last week at a community vigil, where neighbors remembered Singh as a \u201cray of sunshine,\u201d ABC10 reported.\n\nSingh\u2019s family had offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to an arrest, which police said was aided through donations from community members.\n\nCommunity tips led to Kreiter-Rhoads\u2019 arrest, according to NBC affiliate KCRA\ufeff.\n\nHarnek Singh Kang, the victim\u2019s son-in-law, said he is grateful for the support of neighbors. He said the arrest is a step toward healing.\n\n\u201cThere is some peace, yes,\u201d Kang said. \u201cBut eventually, it\u2019s going to heal a little later.\u201d\n\n\ufeffThis article has been updated with comment from Lieutenant Trevin Freitas.", "description": "Police in Tracy, California, say they have no evidence suggesting the killing of Parmjit Singh is a hate crime, but will continue investigating.", "authors": ["Religion Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6e92f03b00009605cbdd8d.jpeg?cache=dfvhnq6wgy&ops=1778_1000"}
