UFC officials announced the fight late Wednesday.\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 23 takes place Dec. 21 at Sajik Arena in Busan, South Korea.

Prior to that, he was involved in the 2016 \u201cFight of the Year,\u201d a losing effort to Cub Swanson. After scoring wins in his first three UFC bouts, Choi will look to snap a two-fight losing skid when he takes on Canada\u2019s Jourdain.\n\nThe 23-year-old Jourdain made his UFC debut on short notice and lost a unanimous decision to Desmond Green at UFC on ESPN+ 10 in May. He draws a tough opponent for his second outing in Choi as he looks to notch his first win in the promotion.\n\nAlso announced for the card is a flyweight matchup between South Korea\u2019s Ji Yeon Kim (9-2 MMA, 3-2 UFC), who will be making a quick turnaround after her second-round finish over Nadia Kassem earlier this month at UFC 243. She\u2019ll take on Sabina Mazo (7-1 MMA, 1-1 UFC).\n\n\u201cColombian Queen\u201d Mazo rebounded from her first career loss in her UFC debut with a dominant unanimous decision win over Shana Dobson at UFC 241 in August.\n\nWith the additions, the UFC on ESPN+ 23 lineup includes:\n\nBrian Ortega vs. Chan Sung Jung Volkan Oezdemir vs. Alexander Rakic Alexandre Pantoja vs. Matt Schnell Da Un Jung vs. Mike Rodriguez Marc-Andre Barriault vs. Jun Yong Park Amanda Lemos vs. Veronica Macedo Doo Ho Choi vs. Charles Jourdain\n\n\n\nJi Yeon Kim vs. Sabina Mazo", "description": "Dooho Choi vs. Charles Jourdain and Ji Yeon Kim vs. Sabina Mazo are the latest additions to the UFC on ESPN+ 23 card in South Korea.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Christian Stein", "The Blue Corner", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/dooho-choi-tuf-23-finale.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
