Allsup\u2019s former account now reads that the \u201caccount has been terminated for a violation of YouTube\u2019s Terms of Service.\u201d\n\nAllsup\u2019s removal was one of a number of take-downs yesterday, including white supremacist organizations like VDare.\n\nIt's great that Youtube banned the white supremacist site VDare. What would be even better is if Google banned VDare across all its products \u2014 like Google News, a platform which supposedly reviews websites before presenting them as legit news sources: https://t.co/Et1yWCkMCw https://t.co/rOjHsd2C8v pic.twitter.com/D0mBcmB0EN \u2014 Natalie Martinez (@natijomartinez) August 26, 2019\n\nThe ban follows a litany of other embarrassments for Allsup, who achieved notoriety for marching alongside a \u201cpro-white\u201d group in the deadly 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2014 a march in which a fellow white supremacist killed a woman with his car. Allsup had previously been banned by companies like Uber and Twitter, which suspended Allsup\u2019s account in late 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYouTube\u2019s ban follows an earlier move to demonetize Allsup\u2019s account, removing his ability to run ads against his video. The white supremacist said that led to a \u201csignificant\u201d financial hit.\n\nAllsup has a well-documented history of public white supremacy and outright bigotry. He\u2019s claimed membership with the white supremacist Identity Evropa group, encouraging other members of the group to join local Republican Party institutions. (Allsup is a former head of Washington State University\u2019s College Republican chapter.) According to The Inlander, a newspaper based in Eastern Washington, Allsup has not only called for \u201cvoluntary racial segregation,\u201d but has claimed there are \u201cintelligence differences between the races.\u201d Before his Twitter was removed, Allsup also retweeted white supremacist Richard Spencer \u201ccountless times.\u201d\n\nAs the Inlander noted, Allsup also appeared on a neo-Nazi podcast in 2018. \u201cAllsup and the co-hosts laugh at a [podcast] segment joking about the \u2018Jew York Times,\u2019 and using slurs like \u2018kike,\u2019 \u2018crack head n\u2014-ers,\u2019 \u2018yid bitch\u2019 and \u2018faggots,'\u201d the newspaper wrote.\n\nOn Gab, a social media platform infested with fascists and white supremacists, Allsup complained that his \u201cmeans to exercise [his] political voice\u201d had been \u201ctaken away from [him].\u201d Of course, there\u2019s nothing preventing Allsup from exercising his \u201cpolitical voice\u201d on other sites, or in public. However, his ability to use YouTube as a platform to broadcast his bigotry is no more.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1157262068.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
