A third store will open in Sinchon, western Seoul.Sephora Korea faces an uphill battle, with the industry dominated by companies like Olive Young and Shinsegae Group\u2019s Chicor.\u201cSephora will be able to have competitiveness over local health and beauty stores by introducing different product lineups,\u201d said Jade Lee of Euromonitor International Korea.BY JIN MIN-JI [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/23193928.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
