Volkswagen launched WeShare, an e-car sharing company, in Berlin this summer. It's not just the Germans either \u2014 Renault executives were talking up their Moov service launched in Paris late last year and PSA has its own app too.\n\nOlivier Reppert, ShareNow's CEO, said in Frankfurt that his company has 15,000 rides a day in Berlin, with 300,000 members, but isn't breaking even on its operation in the German capital, which has a population of over 3 million. The whole industry is waiting for local authorities to act on personal car use. \"Private car ownership will decrease and cities won\u2019t support car ownership in the future,\" he said.\n\nThe economic and environmental aspects of car sharing are pretty compelling. Most private cars spend most of the time parked. That means the resources that go into making a car are inefficiently used.\n\nA few years ago there wasn't much that could be done about that, but sharing platforms now make it possible for a car to be on the road much more of the time.\n\nThat means car sales pitches aimed at exciting consumers with horsepower and engine stats are increasingly ineffective. Shared vehicles are like taxis \u2014 no one cares what model they are. The IBM study found that 48 percent of consumers say the vehicle brand wouldn\u2019t matter to them if they're sharing cars \u2014 but cost and convenience would.\n\nConnected and self-driving vehicles will further erode the connection between people and cars. Instead of being a visceral driving experience, a high-tech car is more of a place to enjoy digital entertainment.\n\n\"Our founding fathers invented this machine 133 years ago, it's given us mobility and individual freedom\" \u2014 Ola K\u00e4llenius, Daimler CEO\n\n\"With people having time on their hands for other tasks besides driving the car, mobility services are a critical consideration,\" notes the IBM report, and asks the question: \"How can automotive companies prevent their vehicles from becoming nothing more than nondescript, cheap transportation vehicles \u2014 with the brand, which was once the company\u2019s identity, sinking into irrelevance?\"\n\nAll of that upends existing car company business models.\n\nAn increased focus on mobility services will mean fewer sales to individual motorists and more bulk deals to fleet managers, whether that's to sharing apps, big corporations or government agencies. At present, fleet sales make up around half of all European sales, depending on the market, but often involve bulk discounts.\n\nIn the short term, car sharing could also help get customers used to new technology like electric cars \u2014 something that issues like range anxiety might make them leery of buying outright.\n\n\"As a customer I hope to get something I haven\u2019t driven before,\" one executive said of the car-sharing and rental market.\n\nFleet sales could also boost the number of low- and no-emission cars on the road as they filter onto the second-hand market, said Julia Poliscanova from Transport & Environment, an NGO. She reckons it takes between four and six years for fleet vehicles to filter through.\n\n\"There is huge potential to accelerate sales into the corporate market,\" said Poliscanova. \"That really makes a difference to the ordinary consumers.\" She wants mandatory targets for companies as well as public authorities to make sure they focus on ordering clean cars as part of new mass deals.\n\nThat's grim news for companies focussed on mass marketing cars to individual owners. It doesn't mean there will be no individual car owners in the future, it's just that the market will be limited to motorists who don't just see cars as a utilitarian product for getting from A to B, said Jonnaert. \"It's not just a mobility, it's a lifestyle product for many.\"\n\nThat's a very different world for automakers.\n\n\"Our founding fathers invented this machine 133 years ago, it's given us mobility and individual freedom,\" said Ola K\u00e4llenius, Daimler's recently appointed CEO. \"But the invention has to be re-invented.\"\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
