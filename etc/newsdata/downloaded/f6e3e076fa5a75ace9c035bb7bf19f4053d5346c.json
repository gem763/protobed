That could be good news for the dollar.\n\nThe drone strike on one of the world\u2019s biggest oil facilities over the weekend raises the specter of escalating tensions across the Middle East -- exactly the kind of scenario that typically fuels demand for assets denominated in the world\u2019s reserve currency.\n\n\u201cAny retaliatory measures by Saudi Arabia would inevitably lead to an increased geopolitical risk scenario, i.e. the demand for safe-haven currencies can be expected to remain buoyant,\u201d wrote Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fongern, strategist at MAF Global Forex. \u201cFrom a fundamental perspective, there is still hardly any alternative to the dollar.\u201d\n\nThrow in still-festering trade tensions, record policy uncertainty, weak growth in Europe -- with no fiscal stimulus in sight -- and the continued outperformance of American markets, and the stage may be set for a new phase of greenback strength if the bulls have it right.\n\nEven after a September pullback, the dollar is the best performing G-10 currency this quarter, and the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index remains close to levels notched two years ago. The latter gained 0.3% at 10:19 a.m. in New York on Monday as the drone strike in Saudi Arabia rippled through markets.\n\nThe latest flow data underscore the kind of support the exchange rate is enjoying from global investors these days. Numbers from EPFR Global Data released last week show cash was piling into stocks amid the global bond sell-off, but beneath the surface it all headed one way: American equity funds attracted more than $17 billion in the week through Sept. 11. Shares in Europe, Japan and the emerging markets all recorded outflows.\n\nTrade War\n\nAs the trade war drags on, haven demand for the U.S. currency is likely to continue, according to Ned Rumpeltin, the European head of G-10 currency strategy at Toronto Dominion Bank. He points out there have been several false dawns in the protectionist spat, and says it\u2019ll be no surprise if that happens again.\n\n\u201cThe dollar remains the best house in a very bad neighborhood,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are few places in the G-10 where the dollar can underperform.\u201d\n\nAnalysis from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. shows the dollar is getting a lift from weakness in developing nations spurred by fears of a slowdown in China.\n\nAbsent a significant pick-up in risk appetite that diminishes the dollar\u2019s flight-to-quality credentials, even fresh U.S. monetary easing would struggle to materially undercut the currency, according to Jane Foley, Rabobank\u2019s head of currency strategy.\n\nBear Hunt\n\nThere remains plenty of ammo for dollar bears. The U.S. has twin deficits and the greenback is the most expensive G-10 currency based on the Bank for International Settlement\u2019s real effective exchange rate.\n\nOne of the biggest bulls -- HSBC Holdings Plc -- acknowledges risks are rising to its strong-dollar call issued in April 2018. In a recent note, it stress-tested the potential impact of three scenarios: fiscal stimulus outside America, thawing trade relations, and U.S. intervention to weaken the currency. They all pose \u201cserious negative consequences\u201d for the greenback, HSBC said.\n\nBut nominal rate differentials matter in a world where more than $13 trillion of bonds globally yield below zero.\n\nAround 60 trillion yen ($560 billion) Japanese government bonds with a coupon of over 1% will mature within three years and that money is likely to be reinvested in U.S. bonds where the whole curve is still positive, said Naoya Oshikubo, a senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management. The company is one of the managers of Japan\u2019s Government Pension Investment Fund, the world\u2019s largest.\n\n\u201cThe dollar will be well supported because of these flows,\u201d Oshikubo said.\n\nJapanese investors bought 2.47 trillion yen of U.S. government bonds in July, the most since 2016, according to the latest data.\n\n\u201cThe dollar is still ticking a lot of boxes for a currency to be long: high liquidity, high security, high yield. Its economic situation still better than others,\u201d said Andreas Koenig, head of global foreign exchange at Amundi Asset Management. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to find attractive alternatives.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Anchalee Worrachate in London at aworrachate@bloomberg.net;Samuel Potter in London at spotter33@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Samuel Potter at spotter33@bloomberg.net, Sid Verma, Mark Tannenbaum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors rushing back to risk assets this month just got a reminder of the kind of simmering geopolitical threats out there.
