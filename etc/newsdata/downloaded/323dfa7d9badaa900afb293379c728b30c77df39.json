He died of his injuries the following year.\n\nThe typhoon has also already affected the Rugby World Cup in Japan, with Saturday's England-France and New Zealand-Italy final pool matches cancelled and other weekend matches in doubt.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Japanese Grand Prix organisers on Thursday pledged that the safety of fans and drivers would be their top priority as they monitor a massive typhoon threatening to cause havoc at the weekend.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8928/43d1a030ae5041dd91763285ac2684ad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
