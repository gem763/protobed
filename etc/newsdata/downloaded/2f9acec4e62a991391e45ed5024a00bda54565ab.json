It has also requested files from the White House itself.\n\nAnd while he has said he will formally object to the impeachment inquiry, Mr Trump acknowledged yesterday that the House of Representatives could easily vote for his removal before the issue is passed on to the senate.\n\nNow, with his allies legally obliged to hand over documents and high-profile Republicans beginning to waver in their support, the president has lashed out wildly at his perceived enemies \u2013 starting with the press.\n\n\u201cThe Media is \u2018Fixed\u2019 and Corrupt\u201d the president tweeted on Saturday. \u201cIt bears no relationship to the truth. The New York Times and Washington Post are pure fiction. Totally dishonest reporting!\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s comments were his first after The New York Times reported that a second intelligence official concerned by his dealings with Ukraine was considering lodging a complaint to run alongside the existing whistleblower statement, according to two sources briefed on the matter.\n\nMeanwhile The Washington Post reported that text messages exchanged by Trump administration officials and Ukraine, made public yesterday, \u201cread like a government-sanctioned shakedown\u201d and that aides had been worried about the president\u2019s calls with foreign leaders \u201cfor some time\u201d.\n\nMembers of Congress have made Mr Trump\u2019s request last summer that Ukraine should investigate Joe Biden the centrepiece of their impeachment probe.\n\nIt follows the whistleblower\u2019s complaint which said that Mr Trump had sought to use military assistance for Ukraine as leverage to push the country\u2019s new president Volodymyr Zelensky towards investigating the 2020 Democratic hopeful.\n\nRead more\n\nTen ways Trump and his supporters are fighting impeachment\n\nHe made a related request of China, specifying Mr Biden and his son, Hunter, on Thursday.\n\nThe president went on to target Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, arguing the so-called transcript of the call between himself and Mr Zelensky absolved him of any wrongdoing. What the White House released was in fact a memorandum of the conversation, not a transcript.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe so-called Whistleblower\u2019s account of my perfect phone call is \u2018way off,\u2019 not even close. Schiff and Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise, they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people!\u201d\n\nLater, Mr Trump quoted a Fox News contributor and said that \u201d\u201dSchiff is a FRAUD!\u201d\u201d\n\nJoseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence, has said the whistleblower\u2019s account of the call was \u201cin alignment\u201d with the White House memo.\n\nThe president went on to lambast Mitt Romney, who had criticised his handling of Ukraine and China. Mr Romney, a former presidential candidate, said: \u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump began his weekend in Washington by launching a tirade against Democrats, Republicans, the Ukraine whistleblower complaint and media organisations, as the impeachment probe that could unseat him dragged in his closest allies.It has been a tumultuous week for the president with Congress stepping", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YuHc61zqeXe3C_ubd3SKyQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/a78dd28f125d254617ac6fa5847c72d9", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
