No major automaker has disappeared, but we will see that happen in the future.\" He added, \"It is crucial to remain competitive. To do that, we need to do more than just make good cars. We need to offer innovative services and solutions.\"\n\nThe global automotive industry is already testing \"flying taxis\" that can take off and land vertically (Uber) and commercializing self-driving cabs (Waymo), while a multitude of delivery services are competing fiercely to develop drones that can drop off parcels.\n\nIn a bid to ride the wave of such new business trends, Hyundai has already announced plans to invest W41 trillion in developing self-driving cars and future mobility technologies by 2025 (US$1=W1,174).", "description": "Hyundai Pins Hopes on Robotics and Future Vehicles", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/23/2019102301148_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
