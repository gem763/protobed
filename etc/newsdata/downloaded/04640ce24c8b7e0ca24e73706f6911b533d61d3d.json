Allow them to explain.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n.@MichaelVick says he isn\u2019t a fan of Cam Newton's fashion in the locker room\n\n\n\n\"This isn\u2019t a fashion show. This is football.\" pic.twitter.com/2S9TiVUF6D \u2014 Speak For Yourself (@SFY) September 23, 2019\n\nWhitlock: I\u2019m going to ask you the question, because I\u2019ve been on this campaign ever since Cam showed up with the scarf wrapped around his head. I didn\u2019t like it from a leadership standpoint. Vick: I didn\u2019t like it either. I didn\u2019t like it. You got everybody watching, Cam. Including your teammates. This is not a fashion show. This is football. Throw the suit on. The hats was cool \u2014 got away with that. But I mean, I respect Cam for what he do as a football player. I respect him because he loves fashion. But it\u2019s a different demeanor, different approach you got to take as far as your appearance and everything, man. Everything plays a factor at the quarterback position.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf there\u2019s anyone who knows that \u201ceverything plays a factor at the quarterback position,\u201d it\u2019s Michael Vick, who in 2007 pleaded guilty to a federal dogfighting conspiracy charge. He was in the middle of his NFL career at that point, and went on to play another seven seasons after serving 17 months in federal prison. Vick obviously doesn\u2019t think that his dogfighting charge made him a worse leader as a quarterback, so it\u2019s pretty rich that he thinks Newton\u2019s fashion, which is not breaking any laws or hurting anyone, has an impact on leadership.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free. Here\u2019s how.]\n\nVick is the last person who should be criticizing anyone for what they do when they\u2019re not playing football, but at least he said he respects Newton\u2019s love of fashion. Whitlock says the QB position is just too sacred for Newton to be expressing himself through creative clothing on game day.\n\nMichael Vick thinks that Cam Newton's quirky fashion sense is getting in the way of his leadership. (Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP)\n\n\u201cIf he's a wide receiver, or if you want to make a fashion statement away from the locker room, no one cares.\u201d\n\nWhitlock, who normally looks like someone who dressed himself from a store named \u201cCLOTHES?\u201d, apparently agrees with Vick that quarterbacks should suppress their personalities and dress like businessmen. Nothing gives someone more confidence than being told they need to change who they are to fit into someone else\u2019s idea of what a quarterback should be, right?\n\nPeople have been calling out Newton\u2019s daring (and occasionally confusing) fashion choices for years. Fortunately for us all, he hasn\u2019t listened to any of them yet, and it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019ll pay them any mind in the future. And the reason is simple: how someone dresses has nothing to do with their leadership skills. Newton wants to express himself through non-traditional fashion, which is in no way related to his ability to play football and lead a locker room. (In fact, the only thing inhibiting him from doing those things now is his foot injury, which will keep him out of action for the second straight week.)\n\nCam Newton is going to keep being Cam Newton no matter what Vick or anyone else says. And Vick might want to consider that he lives in a very large glass house before he throws any more stones at quarterbacks for their leadership abilities.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Michael Vick isn't a fan of Cam Newton's quirky fashion sense.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nA6i2ERP79M3CUSqq1EJoA--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NDk5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/287c81f0-dfaf-11e9-afee-4591e256f291", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
