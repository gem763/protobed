KEYS?? Yes, just as I previously guessed, this skeletal showman was none other than piano-playing David Letterman sidekick Paul Shaffer.\n\nShaffer was one of the Season 2 cast\u2019s great razzle-dazzle entertainers, and he has an impressive, decade-spanning r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that includes co-writing \u201cIt\u2019s Raining Men\u201d; playing in Robert Plant\u2019s Honeydrippers; serving as the musical director for both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the 1996 Olympics\u2019 closing ceremony; and performing in the Saturday Night Live band in the \u201970s. But vocally, he could not compete with the Flamingo, Black Widow, Leopard, Butterfly, or Thingamajig, who all sang this week. (Some would argue \u2014 and by \u201csome,\u201d I mean \u201cme\u201d \u2014 that he should have never survived over Johnny \u201cThe Egg\u201d Weir two weeks ago.) And so, after rattling his rock \u2018n\u2019 roll bones to Jet\u2019s \u201cAre You Gonna Be My Girl\u201d this Wednesday, Shaffer got his ass kicked, much like another comedic character he once portrayed, Spinal Tap\u2019s Artie Fufkin. Oh well. Maybe the Skeleton can still get a deal with Polymer Records.\n\nI mentioned that I had correctly guessed the Skeleton\u2019s identity when he first performed. I have to gloat about that, because America\u2019s most bonkers new guessing game is a lot tougher in Season 2, with tighter \u201cmilitary-grade\u201d security and vaguer clues, now I will celebrate my rare victories whenever I can. But now that I\u2019ve seen some of the celebrities perform twice, I\u2019m feeling more confident in my guesses. Let\u2019s look at this week\u2019s performances and clues packages, and try to keep my winning streak going.\n\nThe Flamingo, \u201cFootloose\u201d\n\nThis YouTube (or \u201cZooTube\u201d) star went from \u201chood rat to Hollywood triple-threat\u201d after she was \u201cdiscovered by powerful wizard.\u201d The girly pink Fisher-Price My First Boombox clue was a tipoff that she might be a pop star of the \u201990s or early oughts.\n\nJudges\u2019 guesses: Fantasia, Ally Brooke, Adrienne Bailon, Kandi Buruss.\n\nMy guess: The interweb and Jenny McCarthy seem to overwhelmingly think this is The Real host and former Cheetah Girls/3LW star Bailon, even though she has taken to Twitter to deny that she\u2019s the singer underneath all that pink plumage, the clues do add up. Bailon did come from \u201chumble beginnings,\u201d as the Flamingo put it, and she was discovered by Ricky Martin. But the real clincher week was the bonus clue that the Flamingo once aspired to be a doctor. So now I don\u2019t believe Bailon\u2019s disavowal, and I realize I should have believed the internet all along.\n\nThe Leopard, \u201cStitches\u201d\n\nThis regal feline spent \u201cmany years at top,\u201d but was abandoned and unwanted as a child. Later, he learned to live his \u201clife in color,\u201d though his career was later plagued by celebrity tabloid scandals. Now he wants to prove he can \u201cflip the script\u201d and still make it in print time.\n\nJudges\u2019 guesses: Jamie Foxx, Billy Porter, RuPaul, Neil Patrick Harris.\n\nMy guess: I am sticking with my original guess, Jamie Foxx. Foxx had little contact with his birth parents as a child (thanks, Wikipedia), has been gossip-column-fodder due to his relationship with Katie Holmes, and he was a prime time star on\u2026 wait for it\u2026 In Living Color. Plus, he\u2019s a successful recording artist, and this was an impressive, professional vocal. And finally, judge Ken Jeong noted that the Leopard is the only Masked Singer \u201cmethod actor\u201d who is competing in character \u2014 and Foxx is a Best Actor Oscar winner. The clincher bonus clue was that he used to serve fast food.\n\nThe Black Widow, \u201cUntil He Cheats\u201d\n\nIn her first clue package, this itsy-bitsy spider with the big voice said she likes to \u201chide in plain sight\u201d and offered such cryptic clues as a peach, a film slate that said \u201cQueen Bee,\u201d and mentions of the words \u201cthreads\u201d and \u201cempire.\u201d She also said she wanted to showcase a darker, edgier side to her personality via her creepy-crawly character. This week, she continued to complain about being forced to fit into a \u201csqueaky-clean image\u201d that never suited her, and said \u201cI never went to prom \u2014 but I pretended to,\u201d indicating that she is a former teen actress.\n\nJudges\u2019 guesses: Lea Michele, Missy Elliott, Raven-Symon\u00e9, Christina Aguilera.", "description": "Who was this skeletal showman?", "authors": ["Lyndsey Parker", "Editor-In-Chief"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/boO8rGrg1UWhz1CWZhQZQw--~B/aD02ODU7dz0xMTI2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/3417fc50-f05e-11e9-bbbd-83843f8b4463", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
