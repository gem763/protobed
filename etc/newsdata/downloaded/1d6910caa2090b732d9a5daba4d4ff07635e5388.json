He offered not a shred of proof of any such danger, while the shattering evidence of Bahamians\u2019 needs still lies everywhere.\n\nThe limit announced by the State Department on Thursday is far below the 110,000 refugees a year that President Barack Obama said in 2016 should be let in. Most of the 18,000 slots, moreover, are already filled by Iraqis who worked with the American military, victims of religious persecution and some Central Americans. That would leave only 7,500 slots for families seeking unification, like parents of Rohingya children who have already been admitted.\n\nThe proffered reason for the cut was the huge backlog in immigration courts as the number of people seeking asylum is expected to reach 350,000. Most refugees trying to enter the United States, though, have already been cleared. So it\u2019s not immediately clear how lowering the annual limit will help ease the backlog.\n\nThere are enormous backlogs, and the United States cannot let in everyone who wants to come. But the severity of the cutbacks makes clear that the administration\u2019s rationale hides its real motive: to score political points with a base of voters fearful of immigration by seeming to keep out as many people as possible.", "description": "Slashing the number of refugees is the latest way the White House has told immigrants to stay away.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/opinion/27refugeesWeb/27refugeesWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
