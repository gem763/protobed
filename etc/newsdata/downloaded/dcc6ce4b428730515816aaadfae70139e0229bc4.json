(She won a bronze medal as part of the women\u2019s sabre team.) Her new book, The Proudest Blue: A Story of Hijab and Family depicts an African-American Muslim girl wearing a hijab and confronting the challenges and celebrating the joys that brings.\n\nMuhammad recalled that as a kid growing up in New Jersey before 9/11, she was taunted for wearing a hijab, with one kid calling her head covering a \u201ctablecloth,\u201d and said she hopes her book can help kids \u201cfeel strong in the face of being made to feel different.\u201d\n\nShe added something that I know resonates with countless Muslim Americans today, \u201cI believe it\u2019s a lot harder in this moment to be Muslim\u2026than it was right after 9/11.\u201d\n\nI heard that sentiment countless times over Labor Day weekend at the Islamic Society of North America\u2019s annual convention in Houston.\n\nIt truly is a tale of two experiences for Muslims today. On one hand, Muslims in America are seeing our greatest successes ever in ways that can be objectively measured. There are now three Muslims in Congress, the most ever. Keith Ellison last year became the first Muslim American to win statewide office when he was elected attorney general for Minnesota. And more Muslim Americans than ever before now serve as elected officials from school boards to state legislatures, with historic wins in 2018 from New Hampshire to New Mexico to California.\n\nIn the world of entertainment there has also been never before seen success. In 2018, Mahershala Ali became the first Muslim American to win an Academy Award for acting, which he repeated in 2019 with an Oscar for his performance in The Green Book. For years, the Muslim American community longed for a TV series focused on a Muslim family. That finally happened in 2019 with the critically acclaimed Hulu Series Ramy, starring Ramy Youssef, about growing up Muslim in New Jersey. There\u2019s also comedian Hassan Minhaj becoming the first Muslim American host of late-night show with his Netflix series, Patriot Act.\n\nYet at the very same time there\u2019s a growing a sense of unease and even fear that something horrible is waiting around the corner for us. And I mean that last part quite literally, given the spike in hate crimes directed against the Muslim community since Trump first called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d entering the United States back in December 2015 through 2018. We have seen our mosques firebombed and self-professed Trump supporters plotting terror attacks to kill American Muslims in places from New York to Kansas. (I was even the subject of death threats and an organized smear campaign by Trump-supporting Neo-Nazis, causing me to sue them in federal court.)\n\nAnd while it didn\u2019t occur in the United States, the white supremacist terror attack on a New Zealand mosque that killed over 50 Muslims sent shockwaves through the U.S. Muslim community, as did the man espousing white supremacist views who killed 11 Jewish Americans while they were in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\nAs one mental health professional explained to NPR recently about the rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes and rhetoric, \u201cWhat is going to be the long-term impact of this persistent exposure to trauma that our kids are facing right now?\u201d No one knows for sure, but there has been a documented spike in bullying of Muslim students in recent years.\n\nConsider for a moment what it would feel like to be part of a faith community that the man in the White House declares he wants to ban from our nation and that other GOP elected officials have demonized over the years amidst plots to murder people in your community. Add to that Trump\u2019s recent attacks on the two female Muslim members of Congress, Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, urging them to go back to their own country. How would that impact your sense of being an other? Your sense of being unwanted in your own country?", "description": "Tom Pennington/GettyWhen you speak with the author of a new children\u2019s book, you typically don\u2019t expect to hear words like \u201cneo-fascist movement\u201d or how the current U.S. president has \u201cunearthed bigotry.\u201d\u00a0But that was the discussion I had with Ibtihaj Muhammad, who made history in 2016 when she became", "authors": ["Dean Obeidallah"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AgmXwG_VgACqr4T0wJkQ1A--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/816a43b56ed070841395dd529d3da0ba", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
