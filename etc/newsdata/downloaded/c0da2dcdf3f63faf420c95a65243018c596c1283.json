It doesn't bring my dad back, it won't bring any other dads and husbands back. We knew dad could not be the only one. We just wanted that question answered.\n\n'We just wanted to see that football cared enough to find out the scale of the problem, to do the right thing and be there for these people when they need them most. Whatever they do, it must be across all parts of the game.\n\n'You can't assume it is not in grassroots and there is no evidence it is generational or that it was the old leather ball. And these players who have suffered dementia must not be a statistic - they must never be forgotten. They remain in the consciousness of the game.'\n\nThe study assessed the medical records of 7,676 men who played professional football in Scotland and were born between 1900 and 1976. Their records were matched against more than 23,000 individuals from the general population.\n\nSportsmail columnist and former England striker Chris Sutton accused PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor of failing his members and their families over the issue.\n\nSutton said on Twitter: 'If Gordon Taylor had anything about him he would apologise to all his union members and their families who he has failed... his own members dying in the most horrible and humiliating way... he failed my dad and hundreds more.'\n\nIn his latest Sportsmail column, Sutton added: 'The PFA - led by Gordon Taylor - had a duty of care to their members. They let them down and, in my opinion, their chief executive has blood on his hands.'\n\nFormer footballer Chris Sutton has also responded to the study by aiming criticism at the PFA\n\nSutton claimed PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor 'has blood on his hands' and must apologise\n\nWhile the dementia stat is an alarming one, the report also confirmed former professional footballers in this investigation lived three and a quarter years longer on average and were less likely to die of common diseases, such as heart disease and some cancers, including lung cancer.\n\nThe research will continue, with this particular project FIELD set to run until 2021.\n\nThe exact causes of the increased dementia rates are not clear from the study, and PFA deputy chief executive Bobby Barnes revealed a number of ex-players were willing to help by allowing their brains to be used for research when they die.\n\n'There is post-mortem brain donation and I can confirm that there are former players who have already agreed to do this,' Barnes said. 'In fact, it includes five of our own staff within the PFA who have agreed to do this.'\n\nThe FA confirmed this report 'does not determine whether the cause is due to concussions suffered by the group of professional footballers, or concussion management, or heading of the football, or style of play, or the design and composition of footballs over the years, or personal lifestyle'.", "description": "Dawn Astle has responded to the recent study that claims footballers are three and a half times more likely to die from neurodegenerative disease than the general population.", "authors": ["George Sessions"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/12/20026294-0-image-a-13_1571743170372.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
