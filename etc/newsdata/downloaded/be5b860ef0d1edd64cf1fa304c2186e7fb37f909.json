She said: \"I was like, \u2018Let\u2019s not do this again, you\u2019re banned\u2019.\"\n\nTom has become close friends with her Strictly dance partner and Johannes has said that Catherine is his 'perfect partner'.\n\nAt 5ft 8in, Catherine is the right height for 6ft 2in Johannes, who said: \"Catherine has this tall posture, so she sometimes looks even taller.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to dance with somebody who complements my height.\"\n\nCatherine and Johannes will be hoping they do not scare the judges during Halloween week with their cha cha cha to Scared Of The Dark by Steps.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
