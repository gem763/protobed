It was just the \u201cright\u201d thing to do.\n\nIn May of 2018, Barr tweeted out a slam on former Obama operative Valarie Jarrett by invoking the Planet of the Apes. Barr later apologized for her tweet, said she was not aware that Jarrett was a black woman, and said she was suffering a side effect from the drug Ambien when she wrote the tweet.\n\nDespite the apology, liberals called Barr a \u201cbigot\u201d for the comment, and in only a matter of days, Iger decided to fire her from her hit show.\n\n\u201cIt took about five minutes to know what we had to do,\u201d Iger told Winfrey. \u201cIt seemed completely insensitive, completely disrespectful. It was very clear. The decision, it was easy to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat she had done was very, very clear,\u201d Iger added. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe any context could make this better or acceptable or could result in us forgiving her. So we did it. And you also know, in today\u2019s world, if there\u2019s a decision to be made by you, make it \u2014 because otherwise the world will make it for you, and that\u2019s never good.\u201d\n\nIn other comments, Iger has said that he would have fired anyone for comments such as the ones by Barr and that the financial costs of firing the star of a hit sitcom did not matter to him.\n\n\u201cI never asked what the financial repercussions would be, and didn\u2019t care,\u201d Iger wrote in his book The Ride of a Lifetime. \u201cIn moments like that, you have to look past whatever the commercial losses are and be guided, again, by the simple rule that there\u2019s nothing more important than the quality and integrity of your people and your product\u2026 Everything depends on upholding that principle.\u201d\n\nDuring the OWN interview, Winfrey also pleaded for Iger to run for president.\n\nWinfrey also praised Iger and stumped for him to run for president at a recent awards ceremony.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Disney CEO Bob Iger recently said that his decision to fire Roseanne Barr from her own hit TV show was an \"easy\" one to make.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/Bobfundraiser1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
