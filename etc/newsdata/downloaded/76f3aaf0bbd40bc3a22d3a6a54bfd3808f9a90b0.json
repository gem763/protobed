It was said trigger warnings were just a passing fad, there was nothing to worry about.\n\nBut this complacency was misplaced. The habit of treating students as fragile \u2018snowflakes\u2019 has accelerated, reaching into every part of the university sector.\n\nA new nadir was reached last week with reports that Oxford University Students Union is to replace clapping with \u2018jazz hands\u2019, where participants signal approval by silently waving both hands at the sides of their bodies, palms facing outwards.\n\nThe purported justification for this is to avoid offending those who are upset by loud noise.\n\nIn the words of the student union\u2019s welfare and equal opportunities officer: \u2018The policy was proposed to encourage the use of British Sign Language clapping to make events more accessible and inclusive for all, including people who suffer from anxiety.\u2019\n\nOxford is not the first students\u2019 union to indulge in this kind of grotesque gesture politics. A ban on clapping was imposed by the National Union of Students at its conference in 2017, while last year Manchester University\u2019s union adopted the same approach at its meetings.\n\nBut it is a tragedy that Oxford, one of the most revered academic institutions in the world, should have succumbed to this dangerous nonsense.\n\nSome might dismiss \u2018jazz hands\u2019 as nothing more than the kind of frivolous, attention-seeking behaviour to which student unions have always resorted.\n\nBut the situation is far worse.\n\nThe Oxford policy is important because it symbolises our culture\u2019s slide into infantalised decadence, where enfeeblement is celebrated and learned helplessness indulged.\n\nIn the current climate of invented grievance, victimhood \u2014 no matter how spurious \u2014 is a passport to special status on campus.\n\nStudents are encouraged to cultivate their vulnerabilities, rather than emphasise their strengths.\n\nBy promoting the belief their students cannot cope, universities are robbing undergraduates of their resilience and leaving them ill-prepared for the real world. There is much talk today about mental health, but our campuses are creating emotional minefields with their relentless focus on the potential for distress \u2014 even at the sound of clapping hands.\n\nIn the words of the student union\u2019s welfare and equal opportunities officer: \u2018The policy was proposed to encourage the use of British Sign Language clapping to make events more accessible and inclusive for all, including people who suffer from anxiety\u2019 (stock image)\n\nOne study in 2015 by the National Union of Students claimed 80 per cent of students had had \u2018mental health issues in the previous year\u2019. At exam time in my own university in Kent, there are always long queues to see the team of counsellors, something that did not happen when mental health was less of an obsession.\n\nThe \u2018jazz hands\u2019 policy is absurd on several other levels.\n\nThe tremendous irony, in all this worship of political correctness, is that the origins of \u2018jazz hands\u2019 could hardly be less progressive.\n\nThe name comes from the 1927 Hollywood movie The Jazz Singer \u2014 the first major film with sound \u2014 in which renowned white actor Al Jolson appeared \u2018blacked-up\u2019 and waving his hands in the manner now approved by Oxford Students Union. The same mix of blackface and jazz hands was later used in the BBC\u2019s The Black And White Minstrel Show, which is today notorious for its racism.\n\nOutside a student union, who could possibly claim any genuine offence at clapping?\n\nApplauding in gratitude, approval or celebration is a basic human instinct that should be cherished rather than banned.\n\nIt has been echoed everywhere, from Ancient Rome to the Islamic world. As academics Gary Lupyan and Ilya Rifkin put it: \u2018Applause seems to be a remarkably stable facet of human culture\u2019 and \u2018has been in existence for millennia\u2019.\n\nIt is also an impulse found in people at any age.\n\nOne key milestone in the development of babies is their ability to clap their hands.\n\n\u2018Jazz hands\u2019 are dressed up in the language of tolerance, but it is the refusal to allow applause that is far more likely to cause offence.\n\nPerformers \u2014 including sports stars, actors, musicians and politicians \u2014 rely on the response of their audiences to be at the best.\n\nThey are hardly likely to draw inspiration from the damp squib of a show of waggling hands. Indeed, if the Oxford decision were copied in other arenas, much of the theatrical excitement of events would disappear.\n\nWhat football fans would want to fork out for live games if they were banned from clapping? Theatres would lie empty, the BBC Question Time studio would resemble a morgue.\n\nIn truth, there is nothing compassionate about jazz hands.\n\nOn the contrary, it is a denial of humanity. The university sector\u2019s willingness to collude with this clapping ban illustrates how far liberties have been eroded in the name of respecting the vulnerable.\n\nAn increasingly authoritarian spirit now prevails on campuses.\n\nAs the progressive orthodoxy is ruthlessly enforced in an Orwellian manner, debate is suppressed, controversial opinions are left unheard, freedom of speech is eroded and maverick speakers no-platformed.\n\nIt is a tragedy that Oxford, one of the most revered academic institutions in the world, should have succumbed to this dangerous nonsense, writes FRANK FUREDI (stock image of Oxford University)\n\nUniversities should be arenas for lively discussion. Instead they are becoming citadels of conformity.\n\nLast month, in another triumph for dogma, Cambridge University announced it has removed red meat from its cafes and canteens to reduce its \u2018carbon footprint\u2019.\n\nDespite Oxford\u2019s blather about social inclusion, jazz hands carry the danger of marginalising the visually impaired, who may welcome loud applause so they can gauge the mood at certain meetings.\n\nFor them, silence could be oppressive. But such contradictions are inherent in the tyranny of political correctness.\n\nA victory for the transgender lobby over self-identification can also be seen, from another angle, as a threat to women\u2019s rights and autonomy.\n\nSimilarly, respect for religious faith can sometimes descend into theocratic censorship.\n\nThe logic of the jazz-hands culture is that almost any activity could potentially be excluded because it might give offence to someone, somewhere.\n\nAnyone who values the traditional liberties of our civilisation should take a stand against this nonsense.
