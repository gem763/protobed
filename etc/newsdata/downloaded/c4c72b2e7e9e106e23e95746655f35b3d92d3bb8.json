And one of the things I said the first season was that it's not a label that fits. Because as a society, we've compartmentalized people with the title of widow as someone who's 80 years old, who's had a full life with his or her partner,' Dorinda told Saratoga Living, earlier this month.\n\nShe added: 'So, I think it's very important for women to hear me and believe me when I say, to be in your 50s and 60s is no longer a dirty little secret. I embrace it, I'm proud of it. You mentally change, you physically change, you spiritually change. '\n\n'Because in a weird way, you're in the last quarter of your life. I'm not so crazy ambitious, but yet I am ambitious. I still want to enjoy my life. I've given a lot, I've seen a lot, I've done a lot and I've become a bit selfish with my time,' she said.", "description": "In December Dorinda Medley will turn 55, but she is already loving it.
