Trump's recent decision to pull back U.S. troops leaves those fighters vulnerable.\n\n\"The United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea,\" Trump said.\n\nHe said no American soldiers are in the area.\n\n\"From the first day I entered the political arena, I made it clear that I did not want to fight these endless, senseless wars \u2014 especially those that don't benefit the United States,\" Trump added. \"Turkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place_and we will hold them to this commitment.\"\n\nHe said the U.S. will monitor the situation closely.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump lashed out over sharp criticism of his decision to pull back U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, insisting he is focused on the \"BIG PICTURE\" that doesn't include American involvement in \"stupid endless wars\" in the Middle East.\n\n\"Fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East,\" Trump said in a series of tweets. \"The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!\"\n\nTrump's words are at odds with longstanding U.S. policy of keeping thousands of American troops in the strategically important region, and his decision is being condemned by some of his staunchest Republican allies.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close Trump ally, stepped up his criticism of the president Wednesday, telling \"Fox & Friends\" that if Trump \"follows through with this, it would be the biggest mistake of his presidency.\"\n\nIn tweets, Graham urged prayers for \"our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration,\" adding, \"This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.\" He also said he would lead an effort in Congress to \"make Erdogan pay a heavy price,\" referring to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nAnother Trump ally, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a member of the GOP leadership, said she was sickened by the prospect of a Turkish incursion. \"Impossible to understand,\" she tweeted, why Trump \"is leaving America's allies to be slaughtered and enabling the return of ISIS.\"\n\nTrump argued on Twitter that \"GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY!\" He said the U.S. went to war under a \"false & now disproven premise, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. There were NONE!\"\n\nTrump said he is \"slowly & carefully\" bringing home \"our great soldiers & military,\" in line with his campaign promise to do so.\n\nHis call for ending U.S. military involvement in the Middle East and bringing the troops home was a feature of his presidential campaign, but it flies in the face of many decades of bipartisan American policy, even as the Trump administration and its immediate predecessor have tried to give additional attention to what they see as long-term security threats elsewhere, including from China and Russia.\n\nThe U.S. has more than 10,000 troops based across the Middle East, including about 5,200 in Iraq, 1,000 in Syria and several thousand others at bases in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Also, the U.S. Navy's Mideast headquarters is at Bahrain in the Persian Gulf.\n\nJust a couple of months ago the Pentagon reestablished a troop presence in Saudi Arabia after a lengthy absence, and in May it added air and naval forces in the region in response to what it views as worrying threats from Iran.\n\nAs a further sign that the military does not share Trump's view that the fight against the extremists is over, a press release Wednesday by the U.S.-led military coalition combating IS highlighted recent battlefield gains. It concluded by saying that \"removing\" IS fighters, weapons and bomb materials \"remains a top priority\" as the group \"continues to plot attacks against innocent civilians and our partners throughout Iraq and northeast Syria.\"", "description": "Trump's written statement was issued hours after Turkey, a NATO ally, launched an offensive against Kurdish fighters in Syria, who have helped the U.S. against the Islamic State but are viewed by Turkey as terrorists.
