The massive iron gates were closed while Unite union members picketed outside.\n\nI joined the demonstration in Albert Street to hear their grievances. They have a very good case. The council is cutting almost a million pounds from its libraries and museums budget, and the same next year \u2013 a reduction of two-thirds.\n\nSome will close, others turned over to volunteers. Librarians and curators will be made redundant and services \u00addrastically curtailed.\n\nAs Neil Kinnock might say, by a Labour council \u2013 a Labour council. And irony of ironies, a council spending \u00a31.4million over the next three years in a bid to be UK City of Culture 2025. National fame, sought at the expense of culture for its own citizens and the jobs of its own employees.\n\nBut what\u2019s happening in Bradford is just symptomatic of a national scandal.\n\nSince 2010, funding for libraries, museums and galleries has been slashed by over \u00a3400million. More than 700 libraries have closed, and 8,000 staff made redundant.\n\nOsborne austerity may be in its death throes, but it\u2019s taking our national heritage with it.\n\nThe government promises new money: too little, too late.\n\nCouncillors desperate to balance the books think librarians are a soft target.\n\nBut these virgin strikers \u2013 it\u2019s their first time on a picket line \u2013 are digging in for a long dispute, with two further rounds of stoppages planned.\n\nI support them, because Routledge\u2019s Law states that there is no guarantee of success if you have a go, only a guarantee of failure if you don\u2019t.", "description": "The council is cutting almost a million pounds from its libraries and museums budget, and the same next year \u2013 a reduction of two-thirds", "authors": ["Paul Routledge"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20716334.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Keighley-Library.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
