Viral memes tying Omar to that image have been thoroughly debunked \u2014 for one thing, because the picture was taken in Mogadishu more than four years before Omar was born.\n\nAD\n\nLarsen eventually deleted the post, as well as a follow-up comment calling Omar a \u201cterrorist,\u201d but he has yet to comment on why he shared the image. Larsen didn\u2019t immediately respond to a message from The Washington Post.\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday evening, Omar slammed the Republican and lashed out at Facebook for allowing inaccurate posts to spread. The freshman Democrat, who has released death threats she has received, argued that such falsehoods add fuel to the violent rhetoric she faces.\n\n\u201cThis is pure propaganda designed to stir up hate and violence coming from a GOP state rep,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cFacebook\u2019s unwillingness to crack down on hate speech and misinformation is not just threatening my life, but our democracy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOmar, a Somali refugee and one of the first two Muslim women in Congress, has become a lightning rod for the right, with President Trump repeatedly targeting her. Trump in July issued a racist attack demanding that she and three other freshman Democrats \u201cgo back\u201d to the \u201ccrime infested places from which they came.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat vitriol has helped a number of false claims gain traction on social media about Omar, a naturalized U.S. citizen who came to the United States when she was 12.\n\nThe photo shared by Larsen has been among the more popular falsehoods \u2014 so much so that the Associated Press issued a fact check in August about the image, which was taken by an AP photographer in the Halane area of Somalia\u2019s capital on Feb. 25, 1978.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFact checking outrageous claims like this must suck!\u201d Omar tweeted at the time. \u201cIt seems like you can make any kind of dangerous, disgusting and disturbing claim against me and have it get traction.\u201d\n\nThe image found traction again with Larsen on Monday. The Minot, N.D., legislator, who owns an insurance firm and previously worked as an educator and mechanic, was elected to the state Senate in 2010 and describes himself as having a \u201cstrong moral compass and constitutional conservative values.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLarsen reportedly left the debunked image up on his page for hours after Port wrote about it on his blog, and appeared to double down on his claims in the comments section. He responded to one critic by writing, \u201cI\u2019m begging to let everyone know she is an elected terrorist.\u201d\n\nBy late Monday, though, he had deleted the original post and his comment. His Facebook page still includes another post about a GOP candidate challenging Omar, where he wrote, \u201chope people get off the couch and take time off work to go vote her out.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The image shared by North Dakota state Sen.
