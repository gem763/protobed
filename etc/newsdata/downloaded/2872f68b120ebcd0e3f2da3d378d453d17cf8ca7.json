FIFA\u2019s last pre-Frostbite seasons were rough, and PES has long been walking a knife\u2019s edge between eccentric brilliance and outright embarrassment.\n\nThis is not a normal Kotaku review Sports game reviews are usually pretty boring, so for a few years now I\u2019ve decided against giving each of these titles a spotlight of their own, instead pitting them in a caged fight to the death. Only insane people are going to get both of these games, so most football fans probably just want to know which of the two is the one to pick up. Most years it\u2019s FIFA. Some years it\u2019s not.\n\nThis year, instead of a confident thrusting of my finger, I can only half-heartedly wave my hand. PES is stuck in the same rut it\u2019s been for years now, capable on the pitch but increasingly a shambles off it, while FIFA has somehow, in a genre defined by its obsession with incremental upgrades, managed to go backwards.\n\nHere\u2019s how this year\u2019s head-to-head review is going to work. I\u2019m going to give you what I like most about both games, what I don\u2019t like, I\u2019ll give a reluctant endorsement to one of them, then we\u2019re going to go our separate ways and reconvene same time next year to see what\u2019s up.\n\n\u201cVolta\u201d, FIFA 20\"s new indoor/futsal mode, complete with story-driven campaign, was supposed to be this year\u2019s big new addition. It\u2019s sadly not very good.\n\nFIFA 20\n\nTHE GOOD STUFF\n\nCAREER MODE - This is less of a big 2019 update and more of just the slow accumulation of features over the last few seasons, but FIFA\u2019s career mode \u2014 especially as a manager \u2014 is now so fully-featured that it\u2019s like a Football Manager Lite, down to keeping players happy and getting into the nitty gritty of international scouting. The new contract negotiation system, which plays out with agents in a tense cinematic office/restaurant environment, is fantastic.\n\nSETUP TOUCH - FIFA\u2019s new \u201csetup touch\u201d makes it far easier to either hold the ball up in tight spaces, set the ball up correctly for a long pass (see below) or take a player on 1v1. Stopping a ball dead at your feet, rolling it a bit, doing a stepover then blasting past a flat-footed defender is one of the best feelings I\u2019ve ever experienced in a football game. I know this sounds like one of those annoying little incremental bullet point updates for a sports game, but this really does make a big difference to the way I played the game.\n\nMISKICKS - While for the most part FIFA has tried to get more realistic over the past decade (it was originally a decidedly arcade experience), one area it always lagged behind PES was the way you could string together pinpoint passes regardless of the direction the person receiving the ball was facing in relation to where he was kicking it.\n\nIn FIFA 20 there\u2019s now very strict rules regarding this, so if you try and just spam quick throughballs into the centre of midfield with your back to the opposition\u2019s half, your players won\u2019t perform leg-snapping miracles, they\u2019ll just completely miskick it. Combined with the physicality and 1v1 \u201cstrafing\u201d of the setup touch, it really helps to slow down FIFA\u2019s pace, and really helps with allowing for calculated build-up play in an opponent\u2019s final third, a ploy previous FIFAs just weren\u2019t interested in accommodating.\n\nTHE BAD STUFF\n\nVOLTA - Ah, this one stings. I\u2019ve been dying for the return of indoor football to mainline FIFA for decades. This year it\u2019s back, and... it sucks. FIFA\u2019s rubbery player animations struggle on the tighter confines of Volta\u2019s fields, and the Hello Fellow Kids attempt at a storyline is absolutely excruciating.\n\nULTIMATE TEAM - Every year Ultimate Team inches closer, NBA 2K-style, to becoming the central focus of the FIFA experience, and every year that bums me out a little more. This mode is essentially gambling, it\u2019s bad news for kids and it has no place in a retail video game that\u2019s already asking for you a big up-front investment.\n\nPES 2020\n\nTHE GOOD STUFF\n\n\u201cTHE PITCH IS OURS\u201d - Every year PES\u2019 gameplay, with its methodical player animation and 1:1 ball physics, gets a little closer to playing like the real thing. This year it got a little closer still. I never, ever score the same goal twice in PES, and its midfield battles are far more tactical than FIFA\u2019s breakneck race to the penalty box.\n\nMENUS - This seems like a minor thing to heap praise on, but for the longest time PES\u2019 front end has been a nightmare to plod through. This year it\u2019s much nicer, which for a game you might be spending hundreds of hours with, makes a big difference!\n\nOne area PES really excels, and I don\u2019t think it gets enough credit for this, is its player models and animation. FIFA looks like a Saturday morning cartoon in comparison.\n\nTHE BAD STUFF\n\nSLOPPY - PES 2020 is just so rough around the edges. It launched without correct team rosters, data updates take forever, in-game replays are doubled in length due to constant splashing of the games logo... everywhere you look, there\u2019s just stuff there (or not there) that feels unfinished.\n\nCOMMENTARY - I think Peter Drury is the worst commentator working in football today, so his mere presence in the game isn\u2019t helping here, but even were I a fan I\u2019d still be criticising PES for this. Its commentary is repetitive, slow and bizarrely unspecific, and after a few games got so tiring I just played games without it.\n\nAI - Here\u2019s the real deal-breaker with PES though: throughout my review, the AI would continually just break down, especially when it came to player movement off the ball. Sometimes my striker would start to make a run behind the defence then just stop and wander off, while my defenders would see an opposition striker heading at them and turn their backs. It didn\u2019t happen all the time, but it happened more than enough for it to make a difference on the scoresheet in several key games, which was absolutely unforgivable.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nBoth games underwhelmed this year because neither failed to progress significantly from where they were in 2018. FIFA 20 in particular feels like a lesser offering than FIFA 19, because The Journey was such an accomplished and enjoyable addition to the game; its absence this year is sorely felt, especially when Volta\u2019s own story is so poor by comparison.\n\nWe\u2019re here for a recommendation, though, not commiseration, and so despite its shortcomings I think FIFA is once again the better overall offering. Volta might be a misfire, but the way I can try and take defenders on 1v1 is now more fun than it\u2019s basically ever been in a football game, regardless of the publisher, and the state career mode is in threatens to pull me away from Football Manager (of which I\u2019m admittedly a pretty casual player) entirely.\n\nPES, meanwhile, tried a little harder than usual this year, spending more on licenses (not having Juventus in FIFA is weird) and changing the name of the series itself. As befitting a game mired in quicksand, though, the more it struggled, the more it found itself stuck.\n\nThe overwhelming impression I got playing both games this year is that they\u2019re just tired. Both series are in need of a fresh shot of adrenaline (and a fresh coat of paint), and they were never going to get it in 2019, in the twilight of the sixth console generation. We can only hope that this year\u2019s stagnation is just a result of something bigger and better coming along next year.\n\nNote 1: I played a retail copy of PES on PC, and had a pre-release copy of FIFA on PS4.\n\nNote 2: I am never calling PES by its new, dumb name.", "description": "I can\u2019t remember the last time both of these games so underwhelmed.", "authors": ["Heather Alexandra", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-25-at-10.49.01-am.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
