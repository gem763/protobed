Today, Wang commands a design firm, Joyce Wang Studio, behind some of the most stunning and iconic luxury interiors in the world: a renovation of London\u2019s Mandarin Oriental (recently reopened after a fire); Ichu, famed Peruvian chef Virgilio Martinez's new restaurant in Hong Kong; Jin Gui, a high-end restaurant in Hamburg; the Landmark Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong; and many more. Wang says she approaches interior design like a filmmaker: incorporating elements of suspense, building character, monitoring flow.\n\nSplitting her time between London and Hong Kong, where she was raised, Wang, who is in her mid-thirties, has developed a reputation, in a relatively short period of time, as an artistic visionary. Her projects, harmonious, expansive designs with lots of marble, wood, and stone, all bear the mark of a distinct, artistic mind.\n\nWe reached out to Wang to hear about some of her favorite things around the world.\n\nMy favorite neighborhood in the world is\u2026 a lesser known area between Bayswater and Marylebone [in London] called Connaught Village. The village is lined with boutique-style artisanal shops. Some of my favorites include Buchanon\u2019s, the local cheesemonger, MarkusCo ffee\u2013it\u2019s where all the bobbies guarding Tony Blair\u2019s house get their coffees; and Abasto, an Argentine grocery. It gets festive in the village with special events like opera in the Italian restaurant over Christmas.\n\nCourtesy Joyce Wang\n\nThe one thing in my kitchen I can\u2019t live without is\u2026 my olive wood butter knife\u2013it has the right amount of flex to scrape every bit of Nutella from the jar and is at room temperature when I put it in my mouth.\n\nIf I were to buy a piece of art, it would be by\u2026 anything by George Condo. He taught me art at Harvard when I was still studying and he was a struggling artist!\n\nThe best book I\u2019ve read in the last year is\u2026 Educated, by Tara Westover. She writes poetically about my favorite part of the U.S., Idaho. The memoir makes me appreciate just how different people\u2019s lives can be and how all the same there\u2019s a will to live and succeed, no matter the circumstance.\n\nA passion of mine that few people know about is\u2026 Design Trust. I\u2019ve been contributing auction items to the Design Trust in Hong Kong annually in support of local young designers as well as established designers who do meaningful work.\n\nThe one trip I\u2019ve taken that I would love to do again\u2026 Zion National Park, Utah. I\u2019ve been there four times now and it\u2019s a place that I\u2019ll always go back to. The landscape is magical and the hikes dramatic, you feel the weight of time there. It\u2019s the kind of landscape that conjures up epic scenes of dinosaurs.\n\nThe next destination on my travel itinerary is\u2026 going back to Melbourne for the second time. I had an amazing first trip there: the food, the art, the design, the host I had, and the people I met. I loved the botanical gardens and all the creative ideas the city has with which to inspire its population. I\u2019m also going to Kyoto for our annual team trip later this year. We will be sourcing antiques for an ongoing Japanese residential project and staying in a Machiya House by the canal together.\n\nThe thing that gets me up in the morning is\u2026 working alongside my team and knowing that the best ideas always come from all of us working together.\n\nThe restaurant in my hometown that I love to take a visitor is\u2026 Mott 32, because it represents Hong Kong and I designed it with my studio. Most importantly, the food is excellent.\n\nIf I could have a drink with anybody, anywhere, it would be\u2026 I\u2019d love a mulled wine, apr\u00e8s ski preferably, with my family!", "description": "The Hong Kong-raised design star loves London\u2019s Connaught Village, an olive wood butter knife, art by George Condo, and more", "authors": ["Brent Crane"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-117677/social", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
