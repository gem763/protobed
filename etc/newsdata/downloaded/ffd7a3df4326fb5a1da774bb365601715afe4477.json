He probably did it in less than a minute,\" Hopkins said Monday.\n\nThe gallery has a video camera, but it wasn't on at the time, Hopkins said.\n\nHowever, surveillance video from another business showed the man strolling down Geary Street with the artwork in his hand, KGO-TV reported .\n\nThe etching normally was secured with a tether, but it wasn't at the time of the theft, Hopkins said.\n\nKGO-TV said the etching would have been secured with a lock and cable that are missing and may have been cut off by the crook. But Hopkins said he doubted that. He suggested the tether might have been removed a day earlier for a showing and not replaced.\n\nAlthough art thieves sometimes have clients who pay for certain pieces, \"I think it was a theft of opportunity,\" Hopkins said.\n\nThe etching was insured, he said. It was one of about 30 pieces on display for the gallery's ongoing Dali exhibition.\n\nHopkins said the etching is relatively rare. \"I'd say it's one of the most desirable pieces out of that period,\" he added.\n\nIt is very well-known and is also numbered, Hopkins said.\n\nThat made it unlikely to be sold online, another director, Angela Kellett, told KGO-TV.\n\nAnyone with information on the theft can contact police.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
