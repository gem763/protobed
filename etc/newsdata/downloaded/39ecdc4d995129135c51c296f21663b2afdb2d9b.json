Additionally, companies said on average that they have seen the effects of the tariffs on 31 percent of the total dollar value of their imported products.\n\n\u201cRising tariffs are putting a painful squeeze on many U.S. electronics manufacturers,\u201d said IPC\u2019s head economist, Shawn DuBravac. \u201cIt seems clear that loss of profitability is impacting the ability of these companies to invest in the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur industry has longstanding concerns about some of China\u2019s industrial policies, including government subsidies and intellectual property violations,\u201d the trade association\u2019s president and CEO John Mitchell added. \u201cBut addressing unfair trade practices by ratcheting up tariffs is like using a sledgehammer to make orange juice. In both cases, it\u2019s the wrong tool and makes a mess of the job.\u201d\n\nThe IPC called on the Trump administration to roll back the tariffs and focus on negotiating a trade deal instead.\n\nThe tariffs have cost the electronics industry over $10 billion since July of last year.\n\nThe administration in August delayed a planned 10 percent tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports in hopes negotiations could be resumed. previously, in May, Washington upped tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, claiming Beijing had reneged on the previously agreed terms of a trade deal. The U.S. also has a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese high-tech products.\n\nIn response, China has imposed 25 percent tariffs on tens of billions in U.S. goods.\n\nThe Trump administration has thus far extended $28 billion in subsidies to American farmers to blunt the effect of the trade war, more than twice as much as was spent to bail out Detroit automakers in 2009, according to Bloomberg.", "description": "American electronics companies are feeling the weight of President Trump's trade tariffs and have begun laying off employees in some cases.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
