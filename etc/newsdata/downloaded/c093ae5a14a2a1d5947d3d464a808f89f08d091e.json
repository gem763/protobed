And while no explicit reason was given for the U-turn, it comes as Netflix has significantly ramped up its activity in Canada.\n\nAfter setting up a production hub in Toronto in February, the Los Gatos, Calif.-based subscription service declared last month that it had already surpassed the $500-million figure it had promised to invest in original Canadian productions by 2022. With popular classic TV shows such as The Office and Friends set to leave the service, and competition on the horizon from rivals such as Disney+ and Apple TV Plus, Netflix will need a stronger portfolio of original shows if it wants to hold on to its subscribers.\n\nA spokesperson for Netflix in Canada declined to respond to Tait\u2019s comments.\n\nAt the heart of the CBC\u2019s complaint is the fact that Netflix and other streaming services, such as Amazon Prime Video and CBS All Access, are not required to collect sales tax in Canada and are not governed by the same rules as domestic producers. For example, Canadian broadcasters are required to put five per cent of their gross revenue into the Canada Media Fund to support creators. Netflix\u2019s investment in Canada is entirely optional.\n\nThe situation has led to outspoken criticism from many broadcasters, including executives from Bell Media and Corus Entertainment.\n\nBut Tait went a step further last January, comparing Netflix\u2019s influence to that of colonialism, accusing it of \u201ccultural imperialism,\u201d and likening its success to the reign of the murderous British Raj in India, comments which drew criticism that she had been insensitive.\n\nTait said she regretted her choice of words, but stood by the sentiment. \u201cThe idea that we are dealing with an empire that could in some ways compromise our own true cultural sovereignty? I do not stand down on those remarks,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think what you\u2019re going to start to see\u2026 is that we believe that anybody profiting from the Canadian system should contribute to the system.\u201d\n\nTait\u2019s comments raise questions over the future of CBC/Netflix coproduction Anne with an E, the Lucy Maud Montgomery adaptation that won seven Canadian Screen Awards earlier this year, including the prize for Best Canadian Drama.\n\n\u2026 we are dealing with an empire that could in some ways compromise our own true cultural sovereignty Catherine Tait, president, CBC\n\nThe show is produced by Northwood Entertainment, which has just completed filming the show\u2019s third season. It is currently being broadcast by the CBC and will air globally on Netflix in 2020. \u201cBoth Netflix and CBC have been incredibly generous and supportive partners,\u201d said Northwood founder Miranda de Pencier, adding she wasn\u2019t sure whether there will be a fourth season.\n\nIn addition to funding and hosting Canadian co-productions on its platform, Netflix also provides a second window and a crucial international launchpad for many independently made CBC shows, such as Kim\u2019s Convenience and Workin\u2019 Moms.\n\nAccording to Kaan Yigit, an analyst for Toronto-based Solutions Research Group (SRG), 55 per cent of all online households in Canada stream Netflix \u2014 a figure that rises to nearly 70 per cent with younger audiences aged 18 to 49.\n\nBy contrast, SRG found that 65 per cent of online Canadians had not even heard of the CBC\u2019s streaming service, Gem. Yigit said Netflix plays an important role in promoting Canadian content throughout the world, citing the CBC comedy Schitt\u2019s Creek as an example.\n\nThe show has reached a global audience on Netflix and landed four Emmy nominations in July, thanks to the U.S. streamer\u2019s awards campaign. \u201cSo to say that Netflix is not contributing to Canadian creators or the domestic business is a narrow interpretation of what is going on,\u201d Yigit said.\n\n\u201cTo my mind, the CBC should be looking for ways to work with Netflix to benefit from its reach and influence, and to benefit creators in Canada.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the CBC boss stopped short of definitively ruling out any future collaboration with Netflix. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing as a black and white as that,\u201d Tait said. But she suggested such collaborations are unlikely as long as it continues to be unbound by Canadian content and tax requirements.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking very carefully at what is good for the ecosystem,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir priority is maximizing their revenues across a global audience. Our priority is maximizing Canadian creators\u2019 health and well-being in this market.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post", "description": "Focus reverts to directly supporting Canadian industry", "authors": ["Adam Benzine", "Special To Financial Post"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/a1226-2016-levy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
