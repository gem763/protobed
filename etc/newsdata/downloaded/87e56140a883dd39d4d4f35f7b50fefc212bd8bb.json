McEachin remains hospitalized following surgery", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. A. Donald McEachin (D-Va.) is in the hospital recovering from two surgeries to address a condition that is not considered to be life-threatening, his spokeswoman said.\n\nThe two-term congressman from the Richmond area missed more than a dozen votes this week, including ones to ban offshore oil and gas drilling, which is one of his top priorities.\n\n\u201cThe Congressman is currently recovering from surgery and subsequently has had to miss votes,\u201d his spokeswoman, Ariana Valderrama, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHe is eager to return to Washington, D.C. and remains in constant contact with his staff for legislative and district updates.\u201d\n\nShe declined to explain the purpose of the surgeries, which she said took place on Aug. 15 and Aug. 29. He did not return to Washington with fellow lawmakers on Monday at the end of the August recess.\n\nMcEachin, 57, an attorney and former state senator, has been hounded for years by health problems related to a 2014 bout with rectal cancer.\n\nIn 2018, he attributed a dramatic weight loss to complications from his cancer treatment and walking miles around the Capitol every week.\n\nHe said he had developed a fistula, which his doctor described to the Richmond Times-Dispatch as \u201can abnormal connection between the bladder and colon.\u201d\n\nHe was also hospitalized in April because of a blood clot.\n\n[Tiny office, minority party and little power? It\u2019s all terrific to Va. representative-elect]\n\nDespite his absence, McEachin\u2019s staff on Wednesday introduced legislation to expand solar energy access to low-income families, the first bill from the United for Climate and Environmental Justice Task Force that he co-founded.\n\nThe third-ever African American to represent Virginia in the U.S. House, McEachin was elected in 2016, from a district that runs from Richmond and its suburbs south to rural counties along the North Carolina border. He served in the Virginia House of Delegates and in the state Senate before getting elected to Congress.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The Virginia Democrat missed votes on banning off-shore drilling, one of his top priorities.", "authors": ["Jenna Portnoy", "Reporter Covering Virginia", "Maryland", "D.C.
