[YG ENTERTAINMENT]\n\nOn Wednesday, boy band Winner dropped their latest EP \u201cCross\u201d and debuted a darker, more serious look than ever before.Casual K-pop listeners who know the group for their upbeat hits like \u201cReally Really\u201d and \u201cMillions\u201d may be surprised to see the sudden change from the group, but for the four-member act known for their versatility, the new EP is a chance to show off a new side of themselves to their loyal fans, explained member Yoon during a press briefing on Wednesday in southern Seoul.\u201cWe said in every interview that we wanted to change, but the changes we made in the past weren\u2019t big enough for the public to notice it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we prepared for this album determined to makes changes in genre, lyrics, concept and visuals.\u201dAnd change they did bring. The music video for \u201cSOSO,\u201d the lead track off of the six-song EP, is easily the most visually shocking video the band have produced since their debut in 2014. Against a powerful hip-hop beat, cars are shown burning, crowds of people are blindfolded and member Hoony appears totally naked.\u201cAs a celebrity I have a really fancy and glamorous image, but I\u2019m lonely and hurt inside,\u201d said Hoony, as he explained the scene in the video.\u201cI was actually supposed to wear underwear, but I wasn\u2019t satisfied with the outcome so I just stripped in front of the camera. I wonder how many people besides me in the industry had this experience,\u201d he laughed.There\u2019s a deeper meaning behind \u201cSOSO\u201d than just the visual shock.\u201c\u2018So-so\u2019 is something that you answer to a question like \u2018How are you doing?\u2019 when you don\u2019t want to show that you\u2019re going through a difficult time,\u201d said Yoon, who was involved in writing both the lyrics and music of the song.\u201cWe tried to reflect that attitude in the music. The lyrics show us trying to act cool, but the tone changes as the song progresses, representing different inner emotions like indifference and anger.\u201dGiven recent events that have beleaguered YG Entertainment, Winner\u2019s agency, the group have plenty of troubling experiences to draw from when preparing \u201cCross.\u201dOne of the biggest struggles for Winner was no doubt the resignation of the company\u2019s founder Yang Hyun-suk. Previously part of a popular boy band himself, Yang had overseen a lot of the musical and creative direction of his artists before being caught up in a series of sex, drug and gambling scandals that brought him and other YG singers down.\u201cIt would be a lie if we say we weren\u2019t troubled [by the recent events],\u201d said Yoon. \u201cNow we don\u2019t have many ways of getting feedback on our work, so for this EP, we had a long discussion amongst ourselves on whether the direction we were taking was right. But I think the situation also gave us an opportunity to show more of our personality.\u201dNot all of the tracks on \u201cCross\u201d are dark and serious - Hoony\u2019s solo track \u201cFlamenco\u201d takes inspiration from the traditional Spanish dance, while \u201cOMG,\u201d which Winner considered making the EP\u2019s title track, has a playful chord progression and sends a thankful message to fans for their support.The group said that they focused on maximizing the performances of the songs off of \u201cCross,\u201d as the timing of the release coincides with the \u201cWinner [Cross] Tour in Seoul\u201d this Saturday and Sunday at Olympic Park, southern Seoul, where the band will perform new songs off their new EP.Following the shows in Korea, the group will go on to perform in more cities across Asia including Taipei in Taiwan, Jakarta in Indonesia, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, Manila and Singapore.\u201cWe\u2019re very excited to go perform in Asia again, and we have worked hard to improve our English,\u201d said Yoon. \u201cWe\u2019ll also probably show our most impressive choreography to date.\u201d\u201cWe will all eventually have go to the military, but we hope to continue making music together even after,\u201d he added, speaking on member Jinu\u2019s upcoming military service that is set to begin next year.\u201cWe plan on releasing a full-length album early next year. I hope people can look forward to that as well.\u201dBY KIM EUN-JIN [kim.eunjin1@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/23201050.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
