Between Two Ferns: The Movie, a feature-length offshoot streaming now on Netflix, expands on the concept by taking Galifianakis' weird low-budget talk show on the road \u2014 in the process stuffing strange surprises into the margins as much as possible.\n\nOne of those surprises is the appearance of a gorgeous new song called \"Walking on a String.\" Presented as a barroom duet between singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers and The National frontman Matt Berninger, it's a gorgeous vehicle for two weary and wonderful voices that pair up perfectly.\n\nNow, \"Walking on a String\" is getting an official release in the form of a lush studio recording that builds to a magnificent cataclysm. If Galifianakis weren't right there in Tom Berninger and Chris Sgroi's lovely black-and-white video, it'd be easy to forget the song's unlikely origins. But there he is, presiding over a bit of gorgeous, unlikely musical alchemy.\n\n\"Walking on a String\" is out now via Dead Oceans.", "description": "Recorded for the soundtrack to Netflix's Between Two Ferns: The Movie, \"Walking on a String\" is a gorgeous vehicle for two voices that pair up perfectly.", "authors": ["Stephen Thompson"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/17/bridgersberninger_wide-9ace80d4d64b06a7acb7b1c3322b2684f2a8eb17.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
