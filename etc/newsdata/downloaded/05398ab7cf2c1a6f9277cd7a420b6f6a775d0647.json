You look at the recent games against France and the boys have had some good success.'\n\nDan Biggar \u2013 who has suffered two concussions in consecutive matches \u2013 is back in full training for Wales, as is George North having overcome a slight ankle knock.\n\nAnd Jonathan Davies was seen jogging at Wales' session on Tuesday ahead of the quarter-final on Sunday.\n\n'You want a full complement. You look at those players, huge experience, great skillset, Jon has a physical threat and you saw what he did with that last line-break just before he got injured (against Fiji).\n\n'Wonderful offload as well. It's vital we have everyone fit and healthy.\n\n'We're in a great position. The medical team have done a fantastic job on our players. From a squad selection, it's brilliant.'\n\nDan Biggar who has suffered two concussions in two matches is back in full training for Wales\n\nAnd now sights are set on France \u2013 a team who shocked Wales in Paris back in the Six Nations \u2013 when 16-0 up at half-time before losing 24-19.\n\n'We will look back on that match,' said Jones.\n\n'It is important we learn lessons from that match. The positives are that we stayed in the fight and got back and won that game, but yes, we've definitely taken some lessons on board from that first-half.\n\n'France have a great pool of players to choose from, they are great athletes, very unpredictable who enjoy the broken field.\n\n'If we are loose and turn ball over easily, then they are in their element and are very, very dangerous.\n\n'Rightly so we're respecting wonderful opposition, which France are, but it's about us getting our house in order.'\n\nThis could be the final week in charge for coach Warren Gatland (R) if Wales lose on Sunday\n\nGareth Davies, the scrum-half, is keen for Wales not to let coach Warren Gatland down in what could be his final week in charge if they lose.\n\n'We've been looking forward to this World Cup for the last 18 months now,' Davies said.\n\n'We all knew it was going to be Gats' last tournament in charge of us and we do speak about it every now and again.\n\n'Especially this week now, it could be our last game. Hopefully it won't be.\n\n'Alun Wyn Jones is a great captain, he speaks really well, and I'm sure he'll mention the fact that it could be Gats' last game.\n\n'As players, we'll keep that in the back of our minds. Hopefully that will give us a couple of extra percentage to come away with a good victory.'", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN BEPPU: Wales\u00a0might have won seven of the last eight Tests against France, but their 2011 World Cup semi-final defeat will inspire them - according to coach Stephen Jones.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/10/19732982-0-image-a-28_1571131744735.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
