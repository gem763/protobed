Until now, Facebook has positioned Portal primarily as a way to chat with friends and family, but the new work-focused updates suggest Facebook is targeting office workers as well.\n\nVideo calls for Workplace seem as if they will work like those made from a Portal device at home, and will take advantage of Portal\u2019s Smart Camera functionality to automatically frame the people on the call, according to VentureBeat. A marketing image from Facebook also appears to show that you can share content with the person you\u2019re talking to, but we haven\u2019t tested this ourselves.\n\nVideo calls will support up to 50 participants, Facebook told VentureBeat. You can\u2019t do a Facebook Live broadcast yet, though. That is apparently coming soon.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a notable hardware omission in this rollout \u2014 at launch, you apparently can\u2019t use Workplace on the recently-introduced Portal TV, according to VentureBeat. Portal TV plugs into a television so you can see video chats on a bigger screen \u2014 which seems like an ideal way to use Workplace.", "description": "Facebook\u2018s Portal video chat devices will be able to run Workplace, the company\u2019s collaboration software, so you\u2019ll be able to make video calls at work using the Portal\u2019s video calling technology.
