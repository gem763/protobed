REUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon/File Photo\n\nLISBON (Reuters) - Ghana and Ivory Coast, the world\u2019s top cocoa producers, are looking at introducing a cocoa production ceiling to support global prices and discourage overproduction, the countries\u2019 industry regulators said on Wednesday.\n\nThe move comes after the West African nations, who produce two-thirds of the world\u2019s cocoa, imposed a fixed \u201cliving income differential (LID)\u201d or premium of $400 a tonne in July on all cocoa sales for the 2020/21 season.\n\nMany cocoa buyers say the LID, which represents a major overhaul of how cocoa is priced globally, could lead to excess production and eventually, to lower prices.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put in (place a) mechanism which sets production ceilings,\u201d Joseph Boahen Aidoo, CEO of the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) told industry representatives at the European Cocoa Forum in Lisbon.\n\nHe declined to say at what level the production ceiling would be set, saying that parliament had to approve it first.\n\nThe director general of Ivory Coast\u2019s Conseil Cafe Cacao (CCC), Brahima Yves Kone, said lawmakers in Ivory Coast and Ghana would likely approve the production ceiling. \u201cAccording to the figures they gave us, we expect them to agree,\u201d he said.\n\nCocoa prices on ICE Futures Europe hit a one-year high of 1,939 pounds ($2,424) in July, in anticipation of the move by Ivory Coast and Ghana to introduce the premium, their latest attempt to combat pervasive farmer poverty.\n\nSpeaking on how the West African nations would implement a production cap in practice, Kone said Ivory Coast had begun mapping and registering the country\u2019s farmers, and should complete the project by 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have all the plantations, all the locations (mapped). No one will enter the sector without permission. We need to be very harsh otherwise we\u2019ll have an explosion (of production),\u201d he said.", "description": "Ghana and Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producers, are looking at introducing a cocoa production ceiling to support global prices and discourage overproduction, the countries' industry regulators said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Maytaal Angel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431270455&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H18T-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
