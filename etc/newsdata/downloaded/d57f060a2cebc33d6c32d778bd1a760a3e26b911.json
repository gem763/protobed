And they appeared more impulsive in tests that evaluated financial decision-making, going for immediate rewards instead of larger ones that would take more time to achieve, the researchers found.\n\nThe results are in the September 26 Current Biology.\n\n\"The lateral prefrontal region that was affected by sport-training overload was exactly the same that had been shown vulnerable to excessive cognitive work in our previous studies,\" Pessiglione said in a journal news release.\n\nThis area of the brain was a weak spot when it came to cognitive control - the ability to process information and control behavior, he said.\n\nPessiglione's work suggests that mental and physical effort both need cognitive control.\n\nIt may be important to monitor fatigue levels to prevent bad decisions outside the athletic arena, in areas as varied as politics, law and finance, the researchers said.\n\nImage credit: iStock\n\n\n\n", "description": "Despite the benefits of endurance sports, an excessive training load can have ill effects on your brain.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2851/26ae6f0979774142b6800324c54be4dd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
