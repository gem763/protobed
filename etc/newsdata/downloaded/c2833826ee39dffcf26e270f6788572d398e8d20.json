The highly anticipated addition to the Rothy\u2019s lineup is perfect for rainy days, cool walks and anything else fall weather can throw your way.\n\nThe boot, which is made of the same repurposed plastic fibers from water bottles as the brand\u2019s best-known sustainable flats, is polished enough for the office and comfortable enough for weekend wear. It has a practical ankle-height silhouette with plenty of stretch and give for a comfortable fit. And, true to Rothy\u2019s design, the Chelsea boots are machine-washable, too.\n\nRothys Rothy's just launched a Chelsea boot?\n\nThe new style is welcome news for Rothy\u2019s fans, especially after the brand tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to launch a hyped-up slide back in May.\n\nI was able to road test a pair of the new Rothy\u2019s Chelsea boots earlier this month and found them to be extremely comfortable for a full day. They\u2019re incredibly easy to slip on with the handy pull tab at the back, and they\u2019re comfortable for my wider feet because the repurposed plastic material is stretchy. They\u2019re also tall enough to wear with ankle socks (not those low-rise socks that fall down all damn day, but genuine ankle socks).\n\nI wore the Chelsea boots for a full Saturday, taking them from Prospect Park to Greenpoint in Brooklyn. I walked more than 11,000 steps when all was said and done, and I found the Chelsea boot to be way more comfortable than other styles I\u2019ve tried from the brand (namely, the Rothy\u2019s \u201cPoint,\u201d which is too narrow for my toes).\n\nBrittany Nims x HuffPost I wore the Chelsea around for a full Saturday, taking them from Prospect Park to Greenpoint. I walked more than 11,000 steps in the Chelsea boot when all said and done.\n\nMy only complaint was a slightly sore pinky toe on my right side that had been rubbed all day. (Though, to be fair, this almost always happens with any pair of shoes because of the shape of my feet.) I found that my heels and arches weren\u2019t as sore or tired as they usually are after a full day of walking around.\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised to see how well the boots held up to a full day of activity, and I\u2019d recommend them as a comfortable women\u2019s walking shoe for weekends and as a good women\u2019s shoe for travel.\n\nRothy's Rothy's new Chelsea boot comes in eight colors.", "description": "I walked 11,000 steps in a pair.
