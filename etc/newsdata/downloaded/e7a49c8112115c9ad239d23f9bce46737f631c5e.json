Secured lending rates shot up in late September, with analysts pointing to scarcity of interbank reserves as well as regulations that limits the size of bank balance sheets and their repo-lending capacity as the potential culprits.\n\nJPMorgan (NYSE: ) says it\u2019s not convinced the Fed has resolved the issues in the funding markets, according to a note from analysts led by Joshua Younger in New York. Funding pressures resurfaced last week even after primary dealers, firms approved to trade directly with the Fed, took all of the available overnight liquidity from the central bank and sold it as many T-bills as possible.\n\n\u201cGiven the benefits of our newfound perspective, we recommend viewing these moves as highlighting the limitations of the Fed\u2019s chosen solution to their operational issues,\u201d the analysts wrote. \u201cWith year-end coming up, this is all likely to get much worse, in our view, before it gets better.\u201d\n\nThe overnight liquidity provided by the Fed goes directly to primary dealers, whereas those most in need of it are the non-primary dealers, the JPMorgan (NYSE: ) analysts wrote. The success of the program therefore depends on how much of the liquidity is passed along, but primary dealers are deterred from doing so by rules specifying how much capital they must hold to protect against losses.\n\nMeanwhile, a preliminary analysis of balance sheets at the largest banks based on their third-quarter results suggests they may have to cut back on repo activity even more at year-end to avoid liquidity charges.\n\n\u201cWhat new permanent reserves are being delivered to the banking system should face the same frictions -- both from balance sheet constraints and intraday liquidity requirements -- that generated these issues in the first place,\u201d the JPMorgan (NYSE: ) analysts said.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s note follows similar warnings from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: )., who have also attributed September\u2019s funding stresses to factors including post-financial crisis bank regulation. Even after the Fed\u2019s latest moves to ease the log-jam in funding markets, \u201cintermediation bottlenecks remain,\u201d Goldman Sachs said.\n\nAnalysts at sell-side banks have argued for the creation of a \u201cstanding repo facility\u201d by the Fed that would allow banks to continuously exchange their securities with the central bank in exchange for cash. Meanwhile, JPMorgan (NYSE: ) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said his bank -- still one of the biggest players in the repo market -- was unable to calm, or profit from, the dislocation in funding markets last month because of regulation.\n\nThe JPMorgan (NYSE: ) analysts recommend investors use futures markets to position for the spread between Fed Funds rate and repo to widen in December, as this will capture year-end funding stress. This has been a popular way for traders to play the funding squeeze, with a surge in activity in these contracts seen following September\u2019s repo spike.", "description": "JPMorgan Warns U.S. Money-Market Stress to Get Worse", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice3b88355902a9d6b21d89b1825d1e21c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
