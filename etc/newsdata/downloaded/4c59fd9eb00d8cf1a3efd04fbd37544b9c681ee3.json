Right: Hamza Abbas\n\n'What comes to mind immediately is a little girl playing in Federation Square next to her mother or some adult who's supervising her and sitting very close to the four men chatting.'\n\nMohamed, Chaarani and Hamza Abbas pleaded not guilty to preparing a terror attack but were convicted by a Supreme Court jury in November 2018.\n\nThey will be sentenced on November 29.\n\nIbrahim Abbas pleaded guilty and was jailed for 24 years.\n\nChaarani (pictured), a twice-convicted terrorist, said he is disgusted by his part in a plot", "description": "Ahmed Mohamed, 27,\u00a0Abdullah Chaarani, 29, Hamza Abbas, 24, and his 25-year-old brother Ibrahim\u00a0planned a terror attack in Melbourne for Christmas Day 2016.", "authors": ["Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/00/19813238-0-image-a-28_1571268737920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
