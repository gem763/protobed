However, if CME FedWatch is an indication of market participants\u2019 sentiments and views, then the probability of no rate cut increased significantly in the last five days. Yet, the majority of respondents still expressed confidence in a second cut in Fed fund rate after July this week.\n\n\n\nIs a Rate Cut Likely?\n\n\n\nAs of Sep 16, per CME FedWatch, there is around 65.2% probability of a 25 basis point cut in benchmark lending rate in September after a same magnitude of cut by the Fed in July. However, 34.2% probability is that the Fed will maintain status quo.\n\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that just a month ago, the CME FedWatch assigned zero probability of no rate cut and saw just 5.4% probability for no rate cut just a week ago. Notably, the July rate cut was the first by Fed after nearly 11 years.\n\n\n\nRecently released strong data of the U.S. economy and spike in oil price, after a severe supply cut from Saudi Arabia following a drone attack last weekend raised concerns about the Fed\u2019s eagerness in cutting rate the second time this year.\n\n\n\nArguments Against Rate Cut\n\n\n\nSeveral industry researchers believe that oil price have skyrocketed 14% on Sep 16, which will result in higher gasoline prices spiraling cost-push inflation. Finally, the inflation rate move closer to Fed\u2019s 2% target rate.\n\n\n\nOn Sep 13, the Department of Commerce reported that U.S. retail sales for the month of August increased 0.4%. Although this figure is half the 0.8% rise in July\u2019s retail sales, it surpassed the consensus estimate 0.2% growth.\n\n\n\nRetail sales growth rates in July and August indicate strong consumer spending in the third quarter of 2019 after it rebounded in the second. Notably, consumer spending accounts for more than 70% of the U.S. economy.\n\n\n\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary consumer sentiment index for the month of September grew to 92 from 89.8 in August. On Sep 12, the Department of Labor reported that U.S. initial claims declined by 15,000 to its five-month low level of 204,000 for the week ended Sep 7, the lowest since April 2019.\n\n\n\nMoreover, both United States and China are considering an interim trade deal which will at least defuse further intensification of tariff war.\n\n\n\nArguments in Favor of Rate Cut\n\n\n\nDespite strong consumer spending, the U.S. manufacturing sector, which accounts for 12% of the GDP, is facing weakness due to the ongoing tariff war. Business confidence has declined resulting in lower business expenditure.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, global economic slowdown is the major concern of Fed. The European Central Bank recently injected stimulus like rate cut and quantitative easing to restore growth in the Eurozone economy.\n\n\n\nChina, Asia\u2019s largest economy and the second-largest trading nation of the world is struggling due to a year-long trade tussle with the United States. China\u2019s GDP in the second-quarter 2019 grew a slowest pace in 27 years. Industrial production in August grew slowest pace since February 2002. Retail sales in August and invest in fixed-asset in the first eight-month of 2019 fell below consensus estimates.\n\n\n\nSlowing global economy is hurting U.S. exports, especially its manufacturing products. Furthermore, higher dollar price is making terms-of-trade against the United States. Moreover, the Fed considers oil shocks as temporary, which means inflation will remain muted in the long term.\n\n\n\nOur Top Picks\n\n\n\nAt this stage, it will be prudent to invest in rate-sensitive sectors like real estate investment trust, utility, telecom and health care.
