The man had visited the embassy before. Fifteen days earlier, he had been turned away by an official who was suspicious of his claims that he was a businessman hoping to invest in North Korea. Before he left, the visitor gave the official his card, which said he ran a Dubai-based investment fund named Baron Stone Capital.\n\nNow the visitor had returned, claiming he had a gift for the embassy\u2019s senior official, So Yun-sok. This time, he was ushered inside and asked to wait in the courtyard between the compound\u2019s main two-storey building and its solid metal outer gate. While the official went to look for Mr So, the visitor walked to the perimeter of the compound and surreptitiously released the lock on the outside gate.\n\nA few moments later, a group of men carrying combat knives, iron bars, handcuffs and fake pistols burst through the embassy door. According to a 14-page summary of the incident by the Spanish high court judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata, within minutes all four male employees at the embassy had been tied up and bundled into a first-floor meeting room. The assailants, some wearing black balaclavas and others with their faces uncovered, spoke in American English and the distinctive Korean of Seoul and the South.\n\nMr So\u2019s wife, named in Spanish court documents as Jang Ok Gyong, was watching television with their eight-year-old son when she heard what sounded like a struggle in the hallway. She locked the room, but soon the assailants forced their way in, though they insisted they would do her no harm. For the next four hours, she and her son were held captive, watched by a man with a black scarf over his face, a body camera and what seemed like a real gun in a holster. She claims she was so terrified that she secretly grabbed a razor to slit her wrists, but was unable to follow through. Instead, she and her son huddled together under a blanket.\n\nIn the meeting room, according to testimony from the embassy staff, the assailants placed black hoods over the hostages\u2019 heads, swapped some of the plastic cable ties they had used to secure the hostages for handcuffs, and ordered them to sit in silence. One assailant was allegedly overheard asking another exactly how many people were taking part. \u201cThere are 11 of us,\u201d was the reply. The senior official, So Yun-sok, was then taken down to the basement, where the group finally revealed one of its aims. They wanted him to defect.\n\nDiplomatic defections are one of North Korea\u2019s most visible problems, and in recent years there have been two high-profile cases. Just a few months before the embassy raid, in late 2018, the acting ambassador to Italy had abandoned his post and gone into hiding. Two years earlier, the deputy ambassador in London, Thae Yong-ho, became the most senior North Korean official to defect to South Korea.\n\nIn the basement, the attackers told So Yun-sok they wanted him \u201cto become the ambassador of a new state set up by them \u2013 a \u2018free\u2019 state,\u201d he later told Spanish investigators. The men claimed that \u201cthe North Korean government has very little time left\u201d and said other groups were \u201cgoing to do the same thing\u201d. Yet there were no embassy raids in other countries, and Mr So refused to defect.\n\nFrom this point onwards, the assailants\u2019 plan began to fall apart. Eventually, with Spanish police outside the embassy growing increasingly suspicious, the men decided to make their getaway. They were remarkably successful. More than six months later, only one of the group allegedly involved in the raid has been detained \u2013 a 38-year-old former US marine sergeant, Christopher Ahn. A global manhunt is under way for up to 10 more assailants.\n\nAfter the attackers fled, in the days and weeks that followed, details about their identities and aims started to trickle out, leaving as many questions as answers. The group seemed to be largely comprised of Korean Americans, South Koreans and North Korean defectors. But who were they? What did they want? Why did they fly across the world to attack an embassy in Europe? And what was the significance of the fact that one alleged member of the group turned out to have impressive connections within Washington?\n\nAlongside the obvious strangeness of the raid itself, Korea-watchers were struck by the timing. A few days later, Donald Trump was due to meet Kim for a summit in Hanoi to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. Was that why this mysterious group raided the embassy? Spanish investigators remain puzzled, but Mario Esteban, a Korea expert at Madrid\u2019s Elcano thinktank, believes it was an attempt to disrupt Trump\u2019s meeting with Kim. \u201cIt was a very risky thing to do, in a friendly country, just before Hanoi \u2013 and messy,\u201d he told me. \u201cNothing else makes sense.\u201d That, however, is not what the attackers say.\n\nThree days after the attack, an obscure dissident group called Free Joseon, or Free North Korea, claimed responsibility, and later announced they were forming a rebel government-in-exile. \u201cWe hereby take into our own hands our destiny and duty,\u201d the group declared. Prior to the Madrid attack, only the most eager Korea-watchers had heard of this group, and observers are still piecing together clues about the group\u2019s members and backers. \u201cIt\u2019s a radical group of people you can call zealots, heroes or fanatics, depending on your point of view,\u201d Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University, a leading expert on North Korea, told me by phone from Seoul.\n\nThere are two opposing versions of events inside the embassy, neither of them fully reliable. One comes from Free Joseon\u2019s website, which strongly denies that violence was used. Its official line is that the group were responding to a request from embassy officials, who had contacted Free Joseon for help in defecting.\n\nThe second version comes from the hostages, who included the wives of two officials and an eight-year-old child. As servants of Kim\u2019s murderous and paranoid regime, they must be careful not to upset their leader or his enforcers. Yet Spanish investigators found enough evidence in witness statements, police evidence and an embassy search to issue arrest warrants for \u201crobbery with violence and intimidation\u201d, \u201cillegal restraint\u201d, \u201cthreats\u201d, \u201ccausing injuries\u201d and membership of a criminal gang. The embassy officials described an experience similar to that of US army captives in Iraq, where Ahn\u2019s battalion once ran a Fallujah detention centre. (Sources close to Ahn told me he was not the only military veteran involved in the raid, but refused to specify which country\u2019s armed services the others had served in.)\n\nThe rights and wrongs of the case should eventually be decided at a trial in Madrid \u2013 that is, if the suspects can be located, the US agrees to Spain\u2019s request for American suspects to be extradited, and North Korea allows its embassy staff to be cross-examined. In the meantime, court and police documents originating from Spain, Italy and the US point to three key, US-based players.\n\nFirst, there is the group\u2019s alleged leader: Adrian Hong. A wanted poster, released by US marshals, says Hong uses at least two aliases, is \u201cconsidered to be armed and dangerous\u201d and had been seen driving around Los Angeles in a large white Kia Soul SUV with a licence plate that read \u201cArdent\u201d. It was Hong who posed as an investor when he first approached the embassy in early February. In reality, Hong is a Los Angeles-based, Yale-educated Mexican-Korean, with a long history of peaceful activism on issues relating to North Korea.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A wanted poster for Adrian Hong released by the US Department of Justice. Photograph: US marshals\n\nNews of Hong\u2019s alleged involvement in the raid astonished many who knew him. \u201cYou could have knocked me over with a gnat\u2019s wing,\u201d wrote Joshua Stanton, a Washington lawyer and author of the long-running Free Korea blog. Yet Spanish \u201cgovernment sources\u201d told the newspaper El Pa\u00eds that the country\u2019s intelligence services had proof that Hong and at least one other group member had been in contact with the CIA. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have said that if they weren\u2019t sure,\u201d claimed Esteban. (The state department has denied any US involvement.)\n\nThe apparent second-in-command was Samuel Ryu, a 28-year-old American who had allegedly been preparing the raid for months, but who remains a mystery. Then, there is Ahn, the former US marine sergeant, who was arrested in Los Angeles on 18 April and is fighting extradition to Spain. Ahn has not denied being present, but his lawyers claimed in court that the embassy takeover was peaceful.\n\nAlthough the Madrid raid seems like a curious sideshow, it is worth recalling the stakes being played for in North Korea. These include nuclear warheads, chemical weapons, a brutal regime that murders and tortures, seven decades of armed standoff and tens of millions of Koreans potentially exposed to the deadly fallout should the Korean war ever start again. Many observers believe Trump is so keen to burnish his reputation by striking a historic deal with North Korea that he is making dangerous and foolish concessions to Pyongyang, without doing anything meaningful to reduce the nuclear threat that Kim\u2019s regime poses. If Free Joseon\u2019s aim really was to disrupt the Hanoi summit in February, they were not the only ones who were looking ahead to that meeting with concern. \u201cPeople were afraid that Trump would basically sign everything to North Korea,\u201d explains Lankov, who was in Washington at the time. \u201cThat was not just [a view held by] conspiracy theorists, but amongst very serious people.\u201d\n\nOn a sweltering July afternoon in Madrid, I called the North Korean official, So Yun-sok, to ask him about the raid. \u201cI won\u2019t talk about that,\u201d was his abrupt reply. In Spain, however, you do not need a diplomat to hear the Kim regime\u2019s official version of events. Instead, you can turn to an eccentric Catalan aristocrat called Alejandro Cao de Ben\u00f3s.\n\nCao de Ben\u00f3s is, for all intents and purposes, head of global PR for North Korea, running an international network of cheerleaders for a country that sits at, or near, the bottom of most global lists for human rights. The 45-year-old Spaniard comes and goes from the Madrid embassy, vets and filters people wishing to visit the country, and ensures visas are issued for selected journalists, investors and tourists. In the past, he ran the Pyongyang Caf\u00e9, a North Korean-themed bar in his home city of Tarragona. For ceremonial occasions Cao de Ben\u00f3s dresses in a uniform festooned with medals, with gold lapel tabs and topped by a peaked officer\u2019s cap with a red band. In conversation, he comes over as a cross between the enthusiastic promoter of an exotic tourist destination and a cold war-style critic of the \u201csatanic\u201d US. He denies that Pyongyang\u2019s notorious regime tortures and executes dissidents. He is, in other words, an extremely unreliable source \u2013 but one with access to at least some inside information.\n\nCao de Ben\u00f3s forwarded me an email he received on 4 February from an \u201cElena S\u00e1nchez\u201d, who claimed to be associate director of Baron Stone Capital. The investment fund had supposedly earmarked up to $50m to invest in \u201cinfrastructure, mining and energy\u201d in North Korea, Mongolia and Myanmar. Its managing director was due in Madrid. Could he visit the embassy? \u201cI started to vet them but the answer, for the moment, was \u2018no\u2019,\u201d Cao de Ben\u00f3s told me. Baron Stone Capital does not appear to be a real company, and it has no presence at the Dubai address where it supposedly had an office.\n\nIt was three days after the email arrived that Adrian Hong first appeared at the embassy gate. He showed a fake Italian driving licence and, after being refused entry, left behind his Baron Stone business card. The following day, Hong flew from Spain to the Czech capital, Prague, but at least one of his alleged accomplices, Samuel Ryu, remained in Spain, staying at the Eurostars Zarzuela Park hotel, just 300 metres from the embassy. In June 2018, Ryu had lodged there for five nights with five South Koreans aged between 22 and 25, at least three of whom appear to have returned to participate in the embassy raid. It seems plausible that they made that trip to scope out their target.\n\nFar from being the bunkered fortress that one might expect, the Madrid embassy is a low, beige and brown building, surrounded by rough land, with rickety- looking security cameras and the sort of low walls that a bored teenager might be tempted to jump. It is an easy, isolated target, sitting on an island of scrubby, undeveloped land in a remote corner of Madrid\u2019s exclusive Moncloa-Aravaca neighbourhood. That, Lankov told me, might help explain why it was chosen for the raid. Apart from three embassy cars, a thief would have found little of value inside. North Korea is poor, and economic sanctions are hitting hard. The cash-strapped embassy housed just one diplomat, his family and three \u201cadministrative staff\u201d (plus one staff member\u2019s wife), who also did the gardening and acted as doormen. In sweltering Madrid, the embassy has a single air-conditioning unit that is wheeled out for visitors. The building\u2019s insurance policy lapsed last year.\n\nOn 20 February 2019, two days before the raid, Hong returned to Madrid and renewed his passport at the Mexican embassy. By then, most of his team were already in the city and had begun buying equipment for the raid, making two visits to a large hardware store called Ferreteria Delicias. \u201cIt was odd because they were buying the sort of things you need for breaking into somewhere, but they were smart-looking and didn\u2019t seem suspicious,\u201d the store owner, Ram\u00f3n Villar, told me. Among the items they bought were 10 iron crowbars, bolt cutters, a telescopic ladder, pliers and tape.\n\nHong, meanwhile, visited a self-styled \u201cpolice boutique\u201d called Shoke, which attracts self-defence hobbyists and Madrid cops wanting to stock up on everything from extra holsters and handcuffs to badges and boots. He bought four combat knives, five pairs of metal handcuffs, balaclavas, some quick-draw gun holsters and six authentic-looking pistols, which were actually harmless \u201cairsoft\u201d pellet guns. The bill came to \u20ac833.15.\n\nIt appears that one of the last to join the team was Ahn, who only arrived on a flight from New York at 8am on the morning of the embassy takeover. By midday on 22 February, with Trump due in Hanoi five days later, the team were ready.\n\nIf Free Joseon\u2019s first mistake that afternoon was having no real Plan B in the event that So Yun-sok did not defect, their other major blunder was to leave an embassy resident unaccounted for. After the raid began, the wife of one of the administrative workers, named in court documents as Cho Sun Hi, locked herself in an upstairs room. She was terrified. In North Korea, South Koreans and, especially, Americans are painted as violent monsters. \u201cI\u2019d always been taught that it [the US] was the enemy, full of big-nosed, big-eyed, vicious people who\u2019d killed my countrymen,\u201d the defector Joseph Kim writes in his memoir Under the Same Sky.\n\nAfraid of what the captors might do, Cho Sun Hi, who is 56, climbed on to a balcony and jumped into the garden, injuring her leg and cutting her head on a stone tile in the process. She then crawled across a paddle tennis court to a back gate, emerging bloodied and dirty on to the street. Seeing her in distress, a passing driver took her a few blocks away to the gates of a private clinic, though she spoke no Spanish and could not explain what was happening. Her wounds were tended to inside an ambulance that was called to the clinic. She only felt safe, she said later, after insisting they call the police. Through a translation app, she was able to explain to the police and ambulance crew that the embassy had been assaulted. It sounded absurd, but a patrol car was dispatched.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christopher Ahn, allegedly shown in pictures taken by a surveillance camera at North Korea\u2019s embassy in Madrid. Photograph: Reuters\n\nWhen police knocked on the door of the embassy, it was opened by a polite man in a suit, with a Kim Jong-un badge on his lapel. This was Hong. All was well, he told them. Police cannot enter a diplomatic delegation \u2013 which is sovereign foreign territory \u2013 without permission. Just in case, however, they waited nearby.\n\nInside the building, the assailants were beginning to panic. So Yun-sok had refused to defect, and now the police were outside. It was time to go. They took the keys to the three embassy cars and sped out of the compound, leaving behind only Hong and one accomplice. The cars were dumped in Madrid and the neighbouring town of Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n over the ensuing hour, one with its doors open and the motor still running.\n\nBack in the embassy, a few minutes earlier, Hong had ordered an Uber using the alias \u201cOswaldo Trump\u201d. Now it was outside, parked in front of the embassy. But the police were there, too, and three North Korean students who had been trying to contact friends inside the embassy were preparing to jump over the garden wall to see what was going on. Instead of leaving in the Uber, Hong cancelled the ride and changed his plan. He and his accomplice went out the back way, through the overgrown plot behind the compound. A second Uber, again ordered by Oswaldo Trump, was waiting for him on a different street.\n\nJust as Hong was escaping, the hostages were starting to free themselves. One rubbed his face on a sofa to lift the bag off his head, while Jang Ok Gyong found a knife to cut the remaining plastic cable ties. Within minutes, they spilled on to the street in front of the startled Spanish police officers. At least one man was still wearing handcuffs.\n\nThe raid had not exactly gone to plan, but it had not been a total failure. While the embassy staff were tied up, the assailants filmed themselves smashing portraits of the Kim family in a separate room. They later sent a video to Fox News. The symbolic potency of this is considerable, Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korea expert at Tufts University, told me. \u201cIt cracks the taboo that the Kim regime is inviolable and cannot be desecrated,\u201d he says. They also stole So Yun-sok\u2019s mobile phone as well as flash drives, and broke open computers to extract hard drives. All of the men involved managed to get away from the scene of the crime safely. The team fled to Lisbon, a six-hour drive away \u2013 with Spain\u2019s ABC newspaper reporting that Hong took his Uber all the way, paying \u20ac900. On 23 February, accompanied by Ryu and two others, Hong flew from Lisbon to Newark, New Jersey.\n\nThen, on 27 February, as Trump was meeting Kim in Hanoi, Hong made a puzzling decision: he contacted the FBI, explaining what he had done and handing over the stolen computer drives. Hong wasn\u2019t detained at that point, since Spain had yet to issue arrest warrants. He was, however, admitting to having committed a serious felony in a friendly country, and when he met FBI agents again in mid-March, he also detailed Ahn\u2019s role. This led to warrants being issued 10 days later and brought Ahn\u2019s arrest (US marshals found him at Hong\u2019s apartment), while Hong himself went on the run and has not been caught.\n\nThe question is why, after conceiving an elaborate plot, then bungling it, then evading capture, Hong would decide to admit it all to the authorities, only to then disappear again.\n\nAdrian Hong arrived in the US in 1991 as a seven-year-old boy. His father Joseph was a taekwondo champion and Christian missionary who had emigrated from South Korea to Tijuana, Mexico \u2013 where Hong was born, and his father taught martial arts under the nickname \u201cEl Tigre\u201d \u2013 before moving a dozen miles across the border to Chula Vista, San Diego. The family eventually settled into a suburban house backing on to a busy freeway.\n\nHong inherited his father\u2019s missionary zeal. As a 17-year-old Yale freshman, he wrote to the Korea Herald, an English-language newspaper in Seoul, to berate young Koreans and Korean-Americans for lacking \u201cpassion for their nation\u201d while sporting the \u201chorrible-looking haircuts and clothes styles\u201d inspired by early K-pop. He described himself as a proud Korean patriot who was \u201cashamed\u201d of his people for their political apathy and loose morals.\n\nDetermination, charisma and righteous conviction took Hong a long way. In 2004, he helped to host the annual Korean American Students Conference in New Haven, where he co-founded an organisation called Liberation for North Korea, or Link. Link, which later changed its name to Liberty in North Korea, was spectacularly successful. Some four years later, aged just 22, Hong was running an NGO with 100 campus chapters worldwide, an annual income of $143,000 and funding from Washington\u2019s Freedom House thinktank.\n\nLink\u2019s co-founder was Paul Kim, a Korean-American comedian known as PK. In April, a couple of months after the embassy raid, Kim received a visit from US marshals on the hunt for Hong, though he didn\u2019t know his old friend\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cHe\u2019s not the bad guy here. He\u2019s one of the smartest guys I know, and also one of the most eloquent writers,\u201d Kim told me on the phone from Los Angeles. Kim also recalled that Hong\u2019s strident activism sometimes failed to impress native Koreans. When American members of Hong\u2019s organisation set up mock funerals in Seoul to highlight the plight of North Korea\u2019s citizens, many locals took offence. \u201cPeople were like: \u2018You don\u2019t live here, you don\u2019t understand. Don\u2019t tell us what to do\u2019,\u201d said Kim.\n\nHong\u2019s grand passion was helping refugees from North Korea. Any North Korean who manages to escape across the border to China faces a difficult path. If Chinese police catch them, they are sent back home, where they risk instant punishment. Most who manage to evade capture are forced to live clandestinely, often in poverty, or end up falling victim to people-traffickers. Link became one of several groups running \u201cunderground railroads\u201d, helping defectors make their way to South Korea or beyond. These still operate today, and Link has rescued more than 1,000 people over the past decade.\n\nHong would sometimes travel to China to assist with Link\u2019s work, displaying the bravery and apparent calmness under pressure that he would later show in Madrid. In some cases, he accompanied young escapees through China personally, buying them fashionable clothes and teaching them to pass as spoiled Korean Americans so that they could travel more freely. \u201cHe was young, his hair was cut in a stylish way, and his clothes were American and very hip. Everything about him, in fact, was cool,\u201d wrote Joseph Kim in Under the Same Sky, after Hong calmly walked him into a US consulate in China. But, just like in Madrid, Hong also had a tendency to overreach and to place exaggerated faith in his own abilities, with disastrous consequences.\n\nIn December 2006, Hong attempted to force the US consulate in Shenyang, a city in north-eastern China, to admit six North Korean refugees. The plan misfired. His team and the refugees were all arrested, though Hong\u2019s eight days in jail were minor compared to the months of prison suffered by others who have been caught helping refugees over the past decade.\n\nTim Peters of Helping Hands Korea, a Christian NGO, told me that Hong\u2019s rashness in Shenyang had alarmed those who had spent years quietly building escape networks. \u201cIt really sent shock tremors through the whole community,\u201d he said. Although the Shenyang Six were allowed to leave the country eight months later, extra Chinese guards were placed around consulates, making it \u201cless likely than ever\u201d that escapees could seek asylum in the US, noted the journalist Melanie Kirkpatrick in her book Escape from North Korea.\n\nAfter Madrid, Peters worries people will conflate the underground railroad with violent attacks such as the embassy raid. \u201cThat\u2019s political,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we, or others, do.\u201d Link has also distanced itself from Hong, pointing out that it has been more than a decade since he was involved with the group. However, sources at Spain\u2019s National Court confirmed to me that it has also issued a warrant for Cheol (or Charles) Ryu, a 25-year-old US citizen who fled North Korea as a teenager, posts on Instagram as @freshprinceofpyongyang (bio: \u201cjust chillin\u2019 in USA until I can go back to the Hermit Kingdom\u201d) and worked with Link until late last year. \u201cIt appears that he was contacted by Adrian Hong and, unbeknownst to our organisation, recruited to be involved in Free Joseon\u2019s activities after leaving Link,\u201d the group\u2019s CEO, Hannah Song, said in a statement sent to me by Link. Ryu has not responded to my emails or Facebook messages. A fifth warrant has been issued in the name of South Korean Woo Ran Lee, the same sources said.\n\nIn 2008, back when Hong decided to leave Link to devote himself to political advocacy, he wrote a farewell note. \u201cLiberty will come for the North Koreans soon,\u201d he promised. From that time onwards, his movements become harder to piece together. What is certain is that he built contacts in Washington, thinktanks and academia, becoming accepted as a serious advocate for change in Korea. He was involved in several social start-ups and became a TED Fellow in 2009, networking and creating independent conferences about political change in Asia and Africa. In 2011, after Libya\u2019s leader Muammar Gaddafi was deposed, Hong organised a conference in the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli, hailing the Arab spring as \u201ca dress rehearsal for North Korea\u201d. Yet the Kim regime stayed stubbornly in place.\n\nIn Washington and elsewhere, Hong won admirers. He had strong enough connections to secure five visits to the White House between 2011 and 2012, and has photographs with Barack Obama to prove it. \u201cHe is a very suave, charming personality in any social setting \u2013 self-confident, but not arrogant,\u201d said Lee, who invited him to talks to his students at Tufts in 2013 after Hong had set up an NGO consultancy called Pegasus Strategies. How Hong made money during this time remains an unresolved question, though South Korea\u2019s conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper has claimed, without offering evidence, that \u201chis consulting work often involved the CIA\u201d. Whatever the case, in retrospect it seems that Hong\u2019s impatience for change was growing.\n\nIn 2015, Hong created the Joseon Institute. Its mission statement predicted \u201cseismic shifts in the near term\u201d and spoke of preparing administrators for a free North Korea. It boasted British Conservative MP Fiona Bruce as one of three advisers \u2013 the others were former prime ministers of Mongolia and Libya \u2013 and claimed to operate in New York, London and Shanghai. (Like many who have worked with Hong, Bruce declined to comment.)\n\nThe institute never lived up to the hype, organising only a tiny number of events. It did boost Hong\u2019s profile, though, and in March 2016, he was invited to speak to the Canadian senate\u2019s standing committee on human rights. That day he was in messianic mode, stating that dialogue with Pyongyang on human rights was pointless. \u201cThey\u2019ve tortured themselves into a corner,\u201d he argued, while continuing to insist that North Korea was \u201con the cusp of the change\u201d.\n\nIt is not clear when Hong first met his alleged future accomplice Ahn, but Ahn\u2019s early life, growing up in LA\u2019s large Korean community, was also rooted in church and family. Like Hong, Ahn had been a serious teenager. He once phoned a local radio station to lament Americans\u2019 \u201clack of patriotism\u201d. At 19, Ahn joined the marines and went on to serve for six years. \u201cAs a Korean-American, I really treasured the soldiers and marines who lost their lives to liberate Korea,\u201d he told the Washington Times for a 2008 article about Vets for Freedom, a Republican-aligned advocacy group. \u201cI always viewed my service as kind of paying it forward.\u201d Colleagues claim that Ahn later ran up a large personal debt to help both Vets for Freedom and out-of-luck veterans.\n\nBy early 2017, Ahn and Hong were undoubtedly in contact, since the two were about to undertake an extraordinary secret mission in response to an event that made headlines around the world. On 13 February 2017, Kim Jong-un\u2019s exiled half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, was murdered at Kuala Lumpur airport when assassins tricked two women into squirting him with VX nerve agent for a fake TV prank. In the immediate aftermath of this assassination, there was reason to believe that the rest of Kim Jong-nam\u2019s family were in grave danger. But the family were quickly spirited away to safety from their home in Macau.\n\nThe following month, a 40-second video appeared on YouTube, featuring Kim Jong-nam\u2019s son, Han-sol. \u201cMy father has been killed a few days ago. I am currently with my mother and sister,\u201d said Han-sol in English. He continued, \u201cWe\u2019re very grateful to \u2013 \u201d, before the sound on the video cut out, preserving the anonymity of the people who helped him to safety. The video was posted by a previously unknown group named Cheollima Civil Defense, which also published a statement on their website thanking the governments of the Netherlands, China, the US and one unnamed nation for their assistance in rescuing Han-sol and his family. Cheollima Civil Defense later renamed itself Free Joseon.\n\nAfter the Madrid attack, with Spanish authorities having broken Hong\u2019s cover, Free Joseon released the unredacted version of Han-sol\u2019s video, in which he thanks \u201cAdrian and his team\u201d for their help. According to Free Joseon\u2019s website, Hong was assisted by Ahn, who \u201cpersonally protected and escorted Kim Han Sol and his family\u201d. It was only then, two years after the incident, that the identity of the people behind Han-sol and his family\u2019s escape from danger was revealed. \u201cI was impressed they managed to maintain secrecy for so long. That shows great discipline,\u201d says Lee, who was \u201cstunned\u201d to see Hong revealed as the man behind the rescue mission.\n\nA separate website, Freedom for Free Joseon, set up this summer to defend Hong and Ahn, makes some extravagant claims about their importance. \u201cThese men, as part of the provisional government of Free Joseon, represent the first legitimate threat to Pyongyang in decades,\u201d it claims. Earlier this year, Hong\u2019s organisation also began selling advanced 45-day visitor visas \u201cto visit Free Joseon (previously North Korea) upon liberation\u201d. These must be paid with cryptocurrency and cost one Ethereum, currently worth around $225.\n\nHong has done remarkable things in the past, but analysts say his government-in-exile is more fantasy than reality. Speaking about the embassy raid, Jean H Lee, a former AP news agency bureau chief in Pyongyang who now works at the Wilson Center thinktank, told me that she believes \u201cthese actions have jeopardised lives on all sides: their own, those of defectors they have extracted, and those in the embassy\u201d.\n\nThe Free Joseon website provides a contact email address, but messages I sent over several weeks remain unanswered. There is, however, at least one public figure willing to defend the group.\n\nLee Wolosky is a deeply connected Washington insider who held antiterrorism roles under presidents George W Bush and Bill Clinton, served as Barack Obama\u2019s special envoy for Guant\u00e1namo closure, and has now taken on a new role, as Hong\u2019s lawyer. Wolosky has appeared on Fox and CNN to discuss Hong\u2019s case. \u201cWe are dismayed that the US Department of Justice has decided to execute warrants against US persons that derive from criminal complaints filed by the North Korean regime,\u201d Wolosky said in a statement posted on the Free Joseon website. (Wolosky confirmed to me that the statement was genuine, but declined to talk further.)\n\nA source close to Wolosky told me he was working pro bono, at the request of \u201ca friend\u201d outside government who is not associated with Korea. His involvement, nevertheless, raises questions about who is backing Hong\u2019s buccaneering \u201cliberators\u201d. Foreign dissident groups such as Free Joseon are quick to exploit the factionalism of Washington, and few issues offer as many opportunities as Trump\u2019s flirtation with Kim. Hong has occasionally moved in similar circles to John Bolton, the ultra-hawkish US national security adviser, who has previously called for a pre-emptive strike on North Korea and who, some observers believe, wants to undermine Trump\u2019s attempts to reach a nuclear agreement with Pyongyang. Wolosky is also a lawyer for United Against Nuclear Iran, a group co-founded by Bolton that describes Kim and the ayatollahs as \u201cnuclear proliferation partners\u201d. Free Joseon says it also wants to prevent weapons sales to Iran. (The CIA has denied any role in the affair, and there is no evidence to suggest any direct connection between Bolton and Free Joseon.)\n\nThe failure of the Hanoi summit and recent tit-for-tat military exercises and missile launches have not erased the fear among North Korea hawks that Trump might do a deal favourable to Kim\u2019s regime. Lankov agrees that Kim will never give up nuclear arms, but says Free Joseon\u2019s dreams of an Arab spring-style uprising are also fantasy. \u201cIf they have a rebellion, they will just machine-gun protesters,\u201d he told me.\n\nNor will North Korea\u2019s elites allow Kim to renounce nuclear arms, since these guarantee their own long-term power and safety. Yet those same elites expect Kim to deliver relief from sanctions. Trump, meanwhile, is thinking about re-election in 2020. \u201cBolton has been pushed aside. Donald Trump just wants something to show voters,\u201d Lankov told me after another trip to Washington in July. He foresees an imperfect, partial deal that will eventually fall apart, but with a triumphant Trump crowing that he has \u201csolved the north Korean nuclear problem\u201d. As China grows, however, the influence of Trump or his successors compared to Xi Jinping and future Chinese leaders will wane considerably. \u201cThe US\u2019s window of opportunity for shaping the future of an Asia-Pacific nuclear player is closing,\u201d Robert Kelly of Pusan National University told me.\n\nIn the meantime, will the men behind Free Joseon get away with their audacious actions? In a remarkable twist, Ahn was released on $1.3m bail in July, despite the fact that almost all US citizens sought on international arrest warrants from Europe are routinely held in custody. The court decision, which allows Ahn to wear a tracking device and live at home in LA while awaiting a full extradition hearing early next year was, in the words of his lawyer Naeun Rim, \u201cvery rare\u201d. Rim argues that Spain\u2019s warrant is based on unreliable evidence from servants of Kim\u2019s regime, and the judge accepted FBI evidence that Ahn was at risk from North Korean assassins. \u201cIt\u2019s a life or death situation for him,\u201d Rim told me. She is likely to present similar arguments at Ahn\u2019s full extradition hearing next year, when the bar for avoiding being sent to Spain will be much higher. Minimum sentences there for both illegal detention and belonging to a criminal organisation are four years.\n\nTwo minutes to midnight: did the US miss its chance to stop North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme? Read more\n\nDespite Free Joseon\u2019s apparent amateurishness and self-glorification, the group has highlighted a key political problem by styling itself as a \u201cprovisional government\u201d for North Korea. This fits Korean history, with a government-in-exile first challenging Japanese colonial rule early in the 20th century. Yet it also defies expectations of an eventual reunification of the two Koreas. In fact, joining the poor North to the wealthy South is so fraught with cultural and other complications that it makes Germany\u2019s tortured reunification seem simple. Many in the South already fret about the immense cost, while their government continues to run a ministry of unification. \u201cIf the North Koreans can just hang on another generation or so they won\u2019t need to worry about unification, because the two Koreas are growing so far apart,\u201d argues Kelly.\n\nThe Madrid raid may eventually become an anecdote in the tragic story of Korea under the Kims. If it was an attempt to stymie Trump\u2019s talks, it failed. \u201cWe fell in love \u2026 No really, he wrote me beautiful letters,\u201d Trump insisted when he and Kim began their flirtation a year ago. On 6 September, Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told Kansas radio station KCMO that the love affair would be back on soon. If Kim gave up nuclear weapons, he suggested, he could do anything else he wanted. \u201cEvery nation has the sovereign right to defend itself,\u201d Pompeo said. Kim is famous for finding creative ways of doing that. Stories of enemies being liquidated with flamethrowers, anti-tank guns or even piranha fish may prove to be exaggerations, but he was happy to kill his brother with a nerve agent. Millions of North Koreans, meanwhile, continue to struggle with abject poverty and repression. Freeing Joseon, surely, means getting rid of more than just its nuclear weapons.\n\n\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.", "description": "The long read: In February, a gang of armed men took a North Korean official hostage and demanded that he defect.
