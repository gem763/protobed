But prophet? Well, quite possibly.\n\nIt seems the Liverpool manager was just about the only person in the world who foresaw Borussia Monchengladbach leading the Bundesliga table after nine rounds of the season.\n\nIt was back in March that Klopp recorded a video message for his former player at Mainz and coaching disciple, Marco Rose, who was then the manager of Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg.\n\nMarco Rose has Borussia Monchengladbach flying at the summit of the Bundesliga table\n\nThe Monchengladbach team celebrate their latest victory - 4-2 against Eintracht Frankfurt\n\nGladbach sit a point clear of Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table after nine games\n\n'I trust Marco in everything,' the Liverpool boss said. 'Marco can have any job and could do any job, too. He really is the most hyped [coach] of all at the moment, everyone is asking about you.'\n\nRose was at that time linked with a number of vacancies in the Bundesliga and beyond but it was Monchengladbach who managed to secure the services of one of the game's most exciting young managers.\n\nJust a few months on and, against all expectations, unfashionable Gladbach find themselves a point clear of reigning champions Bayern Munich at the summit.\n\nNot only that, but the Foals lead the way having played some of the most attractive football seen in the German top-flight this season.\n\nA list of the top tourist attractions in the traditional textile city of Monchengladbach ranks the football club at No 2 so it's little wonder there's growing excitement around their success.\n\nKlopp comforts Rose after he was sent off in a Bundesliga match for Mainz back in 2006\n\nMonchengladbach fans celebrate Denis Zakaria's (left) goal in Sunday's win over Frankfurt\n\nGladbach are one of Germany's traditionsverein, having been around for 119 years and with five Bundesliga titles and two UEFA Cups in their trophy collection. They were European Cup runners-up to Liverpool in 1977.\n\nBut such success is a distant memory and the club declined from the 1980s onwards, even dropping out of the Bundesliga as recently as 2007.\n\nRecent years have seen a revival and Gladbach have played in the Champions League in recent seasons. They came fifth last season under manager Dieter Hecking, whose contract was not extended in the summer.\n\nBut it seems Rose has come in and stepped firmly on the accelerator. Watch Monchengladbach play and it's easy to see the influence of Klopp in their high energy pressing game, the flexibility of their forwards and chance creation.\n\nAfter a bore draw with Schalke on the opening weekend and a 3-1 home loss to title candidates RB Leipzig, things have come together with wins over Cologne, Fortuna Dusseldorf, Hoffenheim, Augsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nGladbach have now topped the Bundesliga table for three weeks for the first time since the 70s\n\nRose salutes the thousands of Gladbach fans who travelled to Roma in the Europa League\n\nEven in their last reverse, 1-0 at Borussia Dortmund on October 19, they created the better openings but, for a change, just couldn't take them.\n\nRose, 43, has certainly lived up to Klopp's 'hype', continuing his good work from Salzburg where he first led their under-19 team to UEFA Youth League glory in 2017 and their senior side to back-to-back Austrian league titles.\n\nKlopp, just nine years Rose's senior, had plenty of arguments with the defender when he first took over at Mainz, largely because he often put him on the bench.\n\nBut over time, Klopp came to appreciate Rose's dedication to the team and he became an influential figure in the dressing room as Mainz earned their first-ever promotion to the Bundesliga in 2004.\n\nEven then, Klopp predicted that Rose would one day become a coach and it's clear the player absorbed everything.\n\nAfter dominating Austria with Red Bull Salzburg, Rose is now at Borussia Monchengladbach\n\nRose hugs Marcus Thuram following Sunday's win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga\n\n'I spent a lot of years under Kloppo and it was a great time,' Rose has said. 'He shaped all of is. We picked up a few things in terms of football, but above all it was the way he was with people.'\n\nBankrolled by Red Bull millions, Salzburg have come to dominate Austrian football, winning the last six league titles and participating regularly in the Champions League.\n\nBut Rose has this season proved he can thrive outside of this bubble after Monchengladbach beat the likes of Schalke, Hoffenheim and Wolfsburg to his signature.\n\nHe is still in regular text message contact with Klopp and both of them can reflect with satisfaction this week at their respective sides sitting top in England and Germany.\n\nRose's first job in the summer was to work with sporting director Max Eberl to reinvest the \u20ac25million received from the sale of Thorgan Hazard to Borussia Dortmund.\n\nBreel Embolo, a summer signing from Schalke, has started the season well with Gladbach\n\nAlassane Plea has also impressed this season, scoring four times for the team so far\n\nThey bought Swiss forward Breel Embolo from Schalke and poached left-back Stefan Lainer from RB Salzburg.\n\nWhat's more, they persuaded France's 1998 World Cup winner Lilian Thuram that his in-demand son Marcus, a forward, would profit in his development from some time with them.\n\nRose assembled his team into a 4-3-3 formation that sees Thuram play alongside Embolo and fellow Frenchman Alassane Plea.\n\nThuram has scored five goals so far this season, Plea four and Embolo three, the trio causing havoc as they overload defenders down the flanks. Plea has also set up four other goals so far.\n\nMarcus Thuram opens the scoring against Eintracht Frankfurt as Gladbach remained top\n\nWhile Gladbach are flying high in the Bundesliga, their Europa League campaign needs a kick-start. They inexplicably lost 4-0 at home to Austrians Wolfsberger and only managed draws against Istanbul Basaksehir and Roma.\n\nBut they'll willingly sacrifice a long run in this season's Europa League in order to increase their chances of playing in the Champions League next season.\n\nThe last time Monchengladbach sat top of the Bundesliga for three consecutive matchdays was back in 1975-76, during their heyday.\n\nWith their team blooming again under Rose, Gladbach's fans are excited to find out what happens next.", "description": "ADAM SHERGOLD: Monchengladbach are the surprise leaders of the Bundesliga thanks in large part to the work of Marco Rose, a close friend of Jurgen Klopp, and bright young manager.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/12/20324074-0-image-a-104_1572351685273.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
