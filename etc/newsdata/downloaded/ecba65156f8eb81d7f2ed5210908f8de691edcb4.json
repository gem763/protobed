He said a company like Facebook entering the fray helps to bring more legitimacy to the underlying technology.\n\nCompanies like IBM have taken the principles behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to create their own blockchain solutions that organize data across a distributed network of computers. The benefit of doing so, they argue, is that it creates more transparency around everything from banking to supply chain management.", "description": "IBM executive Jason Kelley said the firm is looking to foster \"collaboration\" across industries when it comes to blockchain.", "authors": ["Ryan Browne"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105976033-1560925615431gettyimages-1156523636.jpeg?v=1567685774", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
