He became politically notorious in the 1990s for defending Serbia\u2019s conduct during the Balkan wars \u2014 a defense that included equivocations, nearly to the point of denial, regarding Serb war crimes. In 2006, he eulogized Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian dictator principally responsible. Asked about the corpses of Muslims massacred in Srebrenica in 1995, Handke replied, \u201cYou can stick your corpses up your arse.\u201d\n\nThen again, if Handke\u2019s opinions were a cause of outrage, it was, in part, because he specialized in outrage: One of his earliest works is a play called \u201cOffending the Audience.\u201d That and subsequent works (most famously, \u201cThe Goalie\u2019s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick,\u201d later made into the film by Wim Wenders) made him one of Europe\u2019s most celebrated writers long before his Serbia obsession. Like other artists before him \u2014 Colette comes to mind \u2014 Handke turned scandal into fame and fame into scandal.\n\nHandke also resembles other writers, Nobel laureates in particular, in his awful political judgment. The late British playwright Harold Pinter (Nobel, 2005) was only slightly less zealous than Handke in his defense of Milosevic. G\u00fcnter Grass (1999) opposed Germany\u2019s reunification and spent most of his life chiding his countrymen for their failure to confront their Nazi past, only to confess late in life that he had been a member of the Waffen SS. Portugal\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Saramago (1998) was an unrepentant hard-line leftist who, as a newspaper editor, purged and abused journalists who did not tow the Communist Party line. Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (1982) was a close friend of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. Jean-Paul Sartre (1964) visited the Soviet Union in 1954 and praised it for its \u201ccomplete freedom of criticism.\u201d\n\nGiven these precedents, why has the reaction to Handke\u2019s Nobel been so neuralgic?\n\nPart of the answer, surely, is that Handke is considered a fascist (though his full political views are hardly clear), whereas Pinter, Grass and the others were all men of the left, whose fellow traveling with despots could glibly be excused, at least by other leftists, as an excess of idealism. After Saramago died in 2010, PEN America \u2014 an organization explicitly dedicated to protecting free expression \u2014 paid him fulsome tribute, with no mention of his censorious past.\n\nBut part of the answer, too, is that we live in an age that is losing the capacity to distinguish art from ideology and artists from politics. \u201cI\u2019m standing at my garden gate and there are 50 journalists,\u201d Handke complained on Tuesday, \u201cand all of them just ask me questions like you do, and from not a single person who comes to me I hear they have read any of my works or know what I have written.\u201d He has a point. He didn\u2019t win a Nobel Peace Prize or some other humanitarian award. His art deserves to be judged, or condemned, on its artistic merits alone.", "description": "We live in an age that is losing the capacity to distinguish art from ideology and artists from politics.", "authors": ["Bret Stephens"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/opinion/17stephensWeb/17stephensWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
