In one experiment, where people were asked to offer input on a job application for a tutoring position, those providing advice presented 34% more ideas for improvement and 56% more suggestions as to how to do so.\n\nFeedback, on the other hand, put the focus on how an employee had performed in the past, as opposed to offering a constructive, \"clear path forward.\" Honing in on past performance was also found more likely to restrict and narrow a person's understanding of the task.\n\nThe report also said feedback was normally limited to specific times in the year \u2014 at work in the form of annual and quarterly reviews, or at school when students were awarded grades.\n\nSome employees also said the feedback they received was \"overly positive and lacks usefulness.\"\n\nThe report therefore concluded employees in search of constructive feedback could benefit from seeking advice.", "description": "Offering advice to workers is more effective than giving feedback, according to research from Harvard Business School.", "authors": ["Vicky Mckeever"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105797095-1552680440633twenty20_ccc51f93-75ae-4a01-a007-ce8cb84aed26.jpg?v=1552680513", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
