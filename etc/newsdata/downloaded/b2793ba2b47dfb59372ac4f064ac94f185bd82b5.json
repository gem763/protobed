Elizabeth Warren speaks during the Democratic presidential candidates debate in Westerville, Ohio, October 15, 2019. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nHer health-care plan would require middle-class tax hikes. Why won\u2019t she say so?\n\nIf you want a Scandinavian-style welfare state, you\u2019ll need a Scandinavian-style tax code to pay for it. Bernie Sanders is willing to admit as much, and did so again in last night\u2019s debate:\n\nAt the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health-care bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They\u2019re going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less \u2014 substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.\n\nElizabeth Warren was not as forthcoming. Pressed on the subject multiple times by the moderators and other candidates, Warren refused to affirm that her Medicare for All plan \u2014 which will cost approximately $32 trillion over ten years, per an Urban Institute study \u2014 would necessarily raise taxes on middle-income earners. Marc Lacey of the New York Times, noting that \u201cSenator Sanders acknowledges he\u2019s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All,\u201d asked Warren if she should \u201cacknowledge it, too.\u201d She responded:\n\nSo the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear\u201d is a verbal tic of Warren\u2019s that, as anyone who has watched her campaign will notice, almost always means she\u2019s about to dodge the matter at hand.\n\nHere, she certainly implied that she would raise middle-class taxes \u2014 she says she\u2019s committed to cutting overall costs for middle-class families, mirroring Sanders\u2019s higher taxes\u2013lower costs rationale \u2014 but she refused to state, for the record, that she would.\n\nThis is a lie. It\u2019s a lie by omission, but it\u2019s a lie nonetheless. To implement her plan, Warren would have no choice but to raise taxes on the middle class. Moving to a single-payer healthcare system would require the imposition of a significant tax increase on millions of middle-income earners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats often cite Western Europe in defense of their domestic agenda. But those making that comparison tend to elide the fact that middle-class tax rates in those countries\n\nNo sooner did Warren dodge than did the media advance defenses on her behalf. Does Warren\u2019s equivocation on a matter so central to her domestic agenda reflect poorly on her? No, say pundits, who have since insisted that the fault for Warren\u2019s evasion lies not with the candidate but instead with those who would deign to ask her such a question in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York University professor of journalism Jay Rosen explained that the mere act of asking Warren a question about raising taxes on the middle class was \u201ca credibility killer\u201d for \u201cjournalists who keep asking it.\u201d Journalism, apparently, demands that aspirants to the highest office in the land be spared the great trial of answering basic questions about their plans to remake one-sixth of the American economy, lest their responses inadvertently redound to the electoral gain of Republicans.\n\nJack Holmes, a politics editor at Esquire, took issue with the question too. He lamented that the moderators dared to raise the issue at all, as, in his telling, asking \u201cabout raising middle class taxes under Medicare For All\u201d furthers \u201ca Republican talking point.\u201d And?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatt Bruenig of the progressive People\u2019s Policy Project think tank told HuffPost that it is not fair to ask a presidential candidate whether she would raise taxes on the middle-class because \u201cthe thing people don\u2019t like about taxes is it means they have less money.\u201d Bruenig insists that \u201cMedicare for All, as proposed, would mean that middle-class people would have more money, not less money.\u201d That last assertion seems to be a bastard reading of an oft-cited Mercatus study, a reading which the study\u2019s author explicitly rejected earlier this year. \u201cIt is not possible,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto correct every advocate\u2019s mistaken claim that my study found that M4A would lower national health costs by $2 trillion over 10 years. But anyone interested in accurately understanding the study should be aware that it contains no such finding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Of course, the other \u201cthing people don\u2019t like about taxes\u201d is that they necessarily infringe upon freedom of choice, which, to Medicare for All proponents, is a feature rather than a bug.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you have a media like this, who needs campaign staff? Everyone knows Warren is going to raise taxes on the middle-class to finance her ambitious domestic agenda, and she ought to say so out loud.
