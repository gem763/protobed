And their money was on the airline collapsing.\n\nFor the second time in the space of two years, the Civil Aviation Authority was secretly putting together its own pop-up airline, and this was even bigger than the last one, assembled to repatriate stranded Monarch passengers in 2017.\n\nSome 150,000 Thomas Cook customers had flown abroad on holiday, many blissfully unaware that the return leg was in jeopardy. The CAA regulated Thomas Cook in two ways: through its airline operating certificate and its Atol licence, which guarantees customers their holiday should a firm go bust. Both involved scrutinising its finances for solvency. The Atol licence was due for renewal in two weeks. And the CAA had seen enough.\n\nThe Guardian view on Thomas Cook: wiped out by debt | Editorial Read more\n\nHope of a rescue deal still officially remained: banks extending credit or even the government stepping in. But despite that hope, Operation Matterhorn was launched.\n\nDiscreet feelers had been put out for weeks, discussed under the Matterhorn codename to minimise the risk of leaks, to assess the availability of potential rescue aircraft. The grounding of the 737 Max posed an additional headache: other airlines were already using airline leasing firms to fill their schedules.\n\nBut the CAA had been here before, and honed its act. The rescue of XL Airways passengers after that went bust in 2008 wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 officials still joke about dodgy jumbos \u2013 but the blueprint has been clear since two Monarch operations: one in 2016 that was eventually not needed as the airline hung on for grim life, and then the successful repatriation when it collapsed a year later.\n\nWith non-disclosure agreements signed, and handling firms and airline operations teams sounded out in commercial confidence, CAA officials in the Canary Wharf HQ had laid out a plan for almost 50 planes to plug the gaps.\n\nIt would take at least 48 hours to get alternative aircraft into position to run the Thomas Cook schedule \u2013 and that meant paying out for an entire shadow operation even though the airline could, conceivably, still be taking passengers on Monday.\n\nIt also risked precipitating the very thing the CAA hoped to avoid: a collapse in consumer and investor confidence in the airline. In a world of flight-tracking website and social media, hopes for complete secrecy were faint once Matterhorn had kicked in.\n\n\u201cWe monitor those sites,\u201d said a CAA spokesman. \u201cAnd on Friday afternoon I could already see a rumour forum talking about unusual flights in Malaysia, and someone said, [it] must be the CAA.\u201d\n\nBut the alternative to shelling out millions on substitute planes now was for the first group of Thomas Cook passengers \u2013 some 16,000 were due to fly home daily \u2013 to be stranded until Wednesday or longer.\n\nAt a minimum, that would spell uncertainty and rack up hotel bills that the CAA \u2013 under Atol \u2013 would have to eventually cover. At worst, if passengers lacked accommodation, it could spell overcrowding in airports, panic and the spectre of public disorder.\n\nThe button was pressed and a comprehensive website of information, matching each doomed Thomas Cook inbound flight, set to go.\n\nVolunteers at the CAA \u2013 many who had worked through the Monarch collapse in 2017 \u2013 were contacted individually on Sunday, and posted to Gatwick and other airports around the country for 2am on Monday, ready for the announcement of Thomas Cook\u2019s liquidation. They were to stand ready to advise any passengers arriving for flights of the overnight news, their rights and how to obtain refunds for holidays that were not to happen.\n\nThe Foreign Office was meanwhile coordinating the discreet dispatch of staff to help at airports abroad \u2013 along with some Thomas Cook employees, still working for passengers without hope of a pay cheque.\n\nOn Sunday night, that Malaysian Airlines A380 touched down in Manchester, part of a worldwide safety net that had brought in charter planes from the US, Canada and Portugal.\n\nSome of the contracting was straightforward: the likes of Titan Airways and Hi-Fly exist to regularly fill gaps in the scheduled airline market. They are extra planes, with pilots and crew, for hire by big names when circumstances demand.\n\nOthers also stepped in to the breach, exceptionally for Matterhorn: easyJet will devote one of its 14 A320s on standby for the rescue flights, while Virgin and BA made rows of transatlantic seats available for the CAA alone.\n\nFar fewer planes will be needed next week, with no more outbound holidaymakers. The bureaucracy of dealing with tens of thousands of passengers complaints and cases through the Atol scheme is also averted.\n\nAround 15,000, more than 90% of passengers, were due to fly home on Monday: a figure that keeps the CAA well placed for a steady, orderly, relatively cost-efficient repatriations and should vindicate its bet.", "description": "Civil servants spent millions creating a pop-up airline ready to fly back Brits abroad", "authors": ["Gwyn Topham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca31ce852d19d5dd510858cd7371136f934f07c2/0_73_4359_2615/master/4359.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=17e0e2b36a875ecdc9976ced85f56911", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
