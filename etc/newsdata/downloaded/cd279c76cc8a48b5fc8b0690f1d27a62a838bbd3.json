The \"Bernie's Back\" flavor uses hot cinnamon ice cream with a chocolate disc on top and a butter toffee backbone going down the middle.\n\nThe company says it has been working with Advanced Project in St. Louis to close The Workhouse jail and in Miami to slow what the two groups call \"the school-to-prison pipeline.\"\n\nBen Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, the co-founders of the Vermont-based ice cream maker, made the announcement Tuesday in Washington.\n\n25 years in the Navy, a bout with PTSD: Now this former SEAL is a 52-year-old Yale freshman\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/09/03/ben-and-jerrys-new-flavor-justice-remixd-backs-criminal-reform/2200558001/", "description": "Justice ReMix'd is described as cinnamon and chocolate ice cream with gobs of cinnamon bun dough and spicy fudge brownies.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Published P.M.
