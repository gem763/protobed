It has also requested information about a license or identification card holder's name, address, date of birth, sex, race and eye color.\n\n\"When several jurisdictions let us know that they were receiving requests from the Census Bureau, we made our members aware of these requests and that they may receive similar requests in their states,\" the association's spokesperson, Claire Jeffrey, told NPR in an email.\n\nWhile the bureau routinely collects personal information about individuals, it is unclear why it wants to know a person's eye color. The bureau has not yet responded to NPR's question about what it would do with this data.\n\nFaced with growing public reluctance to participate in its surveys, the bureau has turned to existing government records to try to fill in gaps in the incomplete responses it collects. Many state agencies currently share with the bureau records about food assistance programs, for example, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps.\n\nThe bureau's statement on Tuesday comes after recent reports by The Associated Press and other news outlets about the agency's recent interest in driver's license records.\n\nSome states, such as Maine, are refusing to cooperate with the bureau.\n\nThe administration \u2014 which initially said it wanted citizenship question responses to better protect the voting rights of racial and language minorities \u2014 says it now wants to produce citizenship information for states to use when redrawing voting districts after the 2020 census. The bureau recently confirmed, however, that not a single state official told the agency that there was a need to include citizenship information in redistricting data.\n\nThomas Hofeller, a prominent GOP strategist who died last year, concluded that detailed citizenship data could be used to give a political advantage to Republicans and non-Hispanic white people for the next decade after redistricting.\n\nLast month, Latinx community groups in Texas and Arizona filed a federal lawsuit against the administration to block it from using government records to produce citizenship information.\n\nThe groups, represented by attorneys with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Asian Americans Advancing Justice, argue that efforts to generate this citizenship data are part of a conspiracy to prevent the fair political representation of Latinx communities, noncitizens and other immigrants.\n\nThey also contend that some of the records may be out of date and would not be reliable indicators of whether a person is a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe bureau has not finalized exactly what records it plans to use to produce citizenship data in time for the next round of state and local redistricting beginning in 2021. Last month, the bureau's chief scientist, John Abowd, announced that it has set as a deadline for those plans March 31 \u2014 the day before Census Day.", "description": "The Census Bureau is gathering records on people's U.S. citizenship status as part of Trump administration efforts to produce data that a GOP strategist said could politically benefit Republicans.", "authors": ["Hansi Lo Wang"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/16/gettyimages-1154795152_wide-8dc2f0157047850b1c6af1622909bb0b51dd69f6.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
