Henry Slade drops to the bench. May continues on the left wing after recovering from a hamstring injury but there is no place in the matchday 23 for Jack Nowell, who has also been struggling with a hamstring injury.\n\nJones has also named an unchanged pack, opting against recalling George Kruis and sticking with Courtney Lawes in the second row. Kruis had emerged as a contender to start due to his lineout prowess - that was an area where England badly struggled in the 16-15 defeat by the All Blacks 12 months ago - but the more physical Lawes keeps his place.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, New Zealand made the surprise decision to select Scott Barrett, a lock by trade, at blindside flanker. Barrett adds considerable heft to the All Blacks\u2019 pack, which may explain Jones\u2019s decision to stick by Lawes. Including Kruis, nine of the 23 in England\u2019s squad appeared in the 2017 British & Irish Lions\u2019 drawn series against the All Blacks.\n\n\u201cPreparation has been good this week after a solid win against Australia,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWhen you get to this stage of the World Cup it is all about focusing on being in the moment and getting yourself physically right. The squad has approached the game well with real maturity. It has helped having players here who have been on the Lions tour and played against New Zealand. They have been involved in some of the biggest games in world rugby so this semi-final won\u2019t faze them.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, England are unchanged with Billy Vunipola winning his 50th cap at No8, alongside Tom Curry and Sam Underhill in the back-row while Mako Vunipola, Jamie George and Kyle Sinckler continue in the front row, Ben Youngs is again at scrum-half with Manu Tuilagi at outside-centre, Anthony Watson on the right win and Elliot Daly at fullback.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nDan Cole, Joe Marler, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Kruis, Willi Heinz and Jonathan Joseph all continue as replacements alongside Slade while Mark Wilson has been preferred as back-row cover to Lewis Ludlam.\n\n\u201cNew Zealand is a great team, they have an impressive winning record since the last Rugby World Cup,\u201d added Jones. \u201cLike any good team, you have to take away time and space from them and you have to find areas you can pressure them. We believe we have identified a number of areas where we can do that.\u201d\n\nEngland team: Elliot Daly; Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell (capt), Jonny May; George Ford, Ben Youngs, Mako Vunipola, Jamie George, Kyle Sinckler, Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Billy Vunipola.
