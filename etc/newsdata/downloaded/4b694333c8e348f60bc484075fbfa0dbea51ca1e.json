Manuel Margot homered off San Diegan Cole Hamels and also made a spectacular catch in center field.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I took into my start today, making stuff personal,\u201d the 23-year-old Paddack said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to get a wild-card run if we can\u2019t. That\u2019s just basically what I told myself.\u201d\n\nThe Cubs lost for the second straight night and for the fifth time in six games. Milwaukee beat Miami 7-5 in its first game since reigning MVP Christian Yelich suffered a season-ending knee injury. Philadelphia and the New York Mets are two games behind the Cubs and Brewers.\n\nHamels (7-7) didn\u2019t get out of the fifth. The left-hander, who went to Rancho Bernardo High, allowed one run on four hits, struck out six and walked four in 4 1/3 innings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fun,\u201d said Anthony Rizzo, who tripled off Paddack in the second inning but then made two straight outs against the right-hander. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to win games. Just because we won one game, doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to catapult into a winning streak.\u201d\n\nPaddack (9-7) held Chicago to three hits while striking out seven and walking one. He retired the side in order in three of his first four innings. After Rizzo tripled to right leading off the second, Paddack retired the side in order.\n\n\u201cThere was just a lot going into it,\u201d said Paddack, who added that he was motivated by pitching on the anniversary of the 9/11 tragedy. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing some really good baseball recently. I just want to make sure I can keep that tempo for the guys and tomorrow we can get a series win.\u201d\n\nPaddack could have two starts remaining, or the Padres could shut him down. The team has been monitoring him all year after he pitched just 90 innings last season in the minors while coming back from Tommy John surgery that sidelined him all of 2017. He\u2019s thrown 135 2/3 innings.\n\n\u201cI hope so, man,\u201d he said when asked if he thought he\u2019d get at least another start. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lose sleep tonight. I\u2019m going to sleep good. I\u2019m going to get ready for Milwaukee unless they tell me otherwise.\u201d\n\nSaid Chicago manager Joe Maddon: \u201cPaddack\u2019s good. They pitched outstanding tonight. We didn\u2019t get anything going on.\u201d\n\nMaddon said the Brewers are \u201cdefinitely playing well and we\u2019re not. Somehow we\u2019ve got to heat this thing up tomorrow and get back home, where we normally play a lot better.\u201d\n\nMargot provided the Padres their first run one night after his walk-off walk in the 10th inning lifted them to a wild 9-8 win against the Cubs. He drove Hamels\u2018 first pitch of the fifth into the seats in left field, his 12th.\n\nMargot made a leaping catch of Nicholas Castellanos\u2019 drive to center field in the fourth, denying him of at least an extra-base hit.\n\nThe Padres made it 2-0 in the sixth when rookie Ty France scored on reliever Brad Wieck\u2019s throwing error. The Padres were trying a double steal when Wieck\u2019s throw home went over catcher Willson Contreras, allowing France to score.\n\nWil Myers hit a two-run single in the seventh.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the place we want to be at,\u201d Hamels said. \u201cWe\u2019ve battled all year, and as it gets closer and closer, you don\u2019t want to have to put the pressure on yourself or each other for the answers.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nCubs: Maddon said closer Craig Kimbrel, on the IL with right elbow inflammation, probably will be out until next week. He hasn\u2019t pitched since Sept. 1, when he allowed three runs in two-thirds of an inning against Milwaukee. \u2026 INF Addison Russell won\u2019t play until the Cubs are back in Chicago starting Friday. He was beaned Sunday in Milwaukee.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCubs: RHP Yu Darvish (5-6, 4.12) is scheduled to make his team-high 29th start in the series finale Thursday. He\u2019s 2-1 with a 4.13 ERA in four career starts against the Padres.\n\nPadres: RHP Dinelson Lamet (2-4, 3.95) has allowed three earned runs or fewer in nine of his 11 starts, while striking out five or more in 10 starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "If this was Chris Paddack's final start of 2019, he will have finished his rookie season with a brilliant performance that hurt the Chicago Cubs in their pursuit of a wild-card spot.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/cubs_padres_baseball_13885_c0-107-2559-1599_s1770x1032.jpg?23b47feb138ea812d26d18f7d3212c8ad02442b3", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
