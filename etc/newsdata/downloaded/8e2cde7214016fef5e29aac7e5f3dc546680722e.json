He's obsessed,' William said with a laugh.\n\nWilliam speaks to farmers about how vital family is to the estate and how important the outdoors are to his own family.\n\nWhat is the Duchy? The Duchy estate was established by Edward III to provide a private income for his son and heir to the throne Edward, later known as the Black Prince, and its purpose remains the same today. Charles took over management of the Duchy when he was 21, after the Queen's accession to the throne. Today the estate is a private portfolio of land, financial investments and property including the Oval cricket ground in Kennington, south London, and 67,000 acres of Dartmoor.\n\n'My children are already playing on the tractors and ... it's so important to get outside, and have the children understand nature,' William said.\n\nCharles's eldest son said he is 'very passionate' about farming and is learning as much as he can on the Queen's estate at Sandringham.\n\nAs William prepares for his future role, he asks farmer Mervyn Keeling if there is anything the Duchy could be doing better for its tenants.\n\nMr Keeling explains Brexit is a big rural issue.\n\n'We had a meeting with your father, he arranged it about Brexit ... but even they couldn't answer the questions for us,' Mr Keeling said.\n\n'Because nobody knows, but it was nice, 'cos I spoke to him afterwards, and your dad said he knows, and he was interested ... he wants to make sure it's right for us and for the countryside.'", "description": "The Duke of Cornwall admitted he was 'practically reduced to tears' when his son took an interest in inheriting the Duchy.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/21/20347454-0-image-a-51_1572383830326.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
