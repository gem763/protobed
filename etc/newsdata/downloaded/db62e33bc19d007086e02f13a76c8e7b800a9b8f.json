Add Interest\n\nGiuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were indicted Thursday on campaign finance-related charges, and the charging documents filed against them describe the first known steps of a push to remove the career diplomat, Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nTrump removed Yovanovitch from her post in Ukraine in May, but he brought her up two months later on the July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that is now the subject of a House impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn that call, Trump asked Zelenskiy to help Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr investigate still-unfounded allegations that former Vice President Joe Biden forced Ukraine to fire its head prosecutor in 2016 to \"shut down\" an investigation targeting the major Ukrainian gas company Burisma, which employed Biden\u2019s son.\n\nImmediately before mentioning Biden, though, Trump raised Yovanovitch, according to a rough transcript of the call released by the White House.\n\n\"The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that,\" Trump told Zelenskiy, saying the Justice Department would \"get to the bottom of it.\"\n\nAngela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe story of how Yovanovitch ended up in the president's crosshairs, however, began in the spring of 2018, when an unidentified Ukrainian government official asked Parnas for \"assistance in causing the U.S. government to remove or recall\" Yovanovitch, according to the charging documents unsealed Thursday against Parnas and Fruman.\n\nBy January, nearly seven months after the Ukrainian official sought help from Parnas, Yovanovitch had yet to be removed. Around the same time, Giuliani was drafted into the effort, believing it could help undercut special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s widening investigation into whether members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign were coopted by Russian intelligence services.\n\n\"I got information [at the time] that a lot of the explanations for how this whole phony investigation started will be in Ukraine,\" Giuliani later recalled to Fox News. \"And it stems around the ambassador and the embassy being used for political purposes. So I began getting some people that were coming forward and telling me about that. And then all of a sudden, they revealed the story about Burisma and Biden\u2019s son.\"\n\nOne of the people Giuliani spoke with was Viktor Shokin, the former prosecutor fired in 2016 at the behest of Biden and other officials around the world who viewed Shokin as deeply corrupt and ineffective. At the time, Biden even threatened to withhold $1 billion in financial assistance to Ukraine if its government didn\u2019t replace Shokin. The International Monetary Fund also threatened to withhold aid if reforms, such as Shokin's removal, weren't made.\n\nIn late January, Giuliani, Parnas, Fruman and others gathered in Giuliani\u2019s New York office to interview Shokin over the phone. Shokin suggested Biden may have wanted him fired to protect Biden\u2019s son, and he told the group that Yovanovitch was \"close to Biden,\" according to notes of the conversation reviewed by ABC News.\n\nAlexandria Sheriffs Office\n\nGiuliani, Parnas and Fruman also spoke with Shokin\u2019s successor, Yuriy Lutsenko, according to the documents reviewed by ABC News. He offered a similar assessment as Shokin, according to the documents.\n\nYet two months later, Yovanovitch still remained as ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nThen, in a March interview with a conservative columnist at The Hill newspaper, Lutsenko offered a new explosive allegation against Yovanovitch: In their first meeting, Lutsenko alleged, the ambassador gave him a \"do-not-prosecute list\" -- a list of Ukrainians that the Ukrainian government could not investigate.\n\nLutsenko also said he had opened an investigation into whether Ukrainian officials tried to help Hillary Clinton win the 2016 presidential election by leaking a series of financial documents linking Trump\u2019s then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, to corrupt proceeds. Lutsenko has since retracted some of his previous statements, particularly his claims about Biden.\n\nNevertheless, despite questions about Lutsenko's credibility, Trump posted the reporting to his Twitter account within hours of it being published.\n\nVictoria Toensing, an outspoken Trump ally who has worked with Giuliani and Parnas, also posted the reporting to her Twitter page, writing, \"The real collusion began in Ukraine. U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.\"\n\nFive days later, the conservative columnist who published Lutsenko\u2019s claims sent an email to Parnas and Toensing, forwarding them a preview of his upcoming report that would allege further political bias at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine and offer new alleged details on the purported \"do-not-prosecute list\" that Lutsenko claimed Yovanovitch gave him.\n\nMikhail Palinchak/AP, FILE\n\nThe next day, the website Medium published a story by an unknown author named \"Tony Sealy,\" noting The Hill newspaper\u2019s previous reporting and disclosing what it claimed was the purported \"do-not-prosecute list.\" But, according to internal emails described to ABC News, officials inside the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine almost immediately recognized it as \"a totally manufactured, fake list\" and a \"classic disinfo play,\" as one senior official wrote at the time.\n\n\"One key sign of it being fake is that most of the names are misspelled in English -- we would never spell most that way,\" a top diplomat at the embassy, George Kent, wrote. And the embassy could find no evidence that \"Tony Sealy\" even existed.\n\n\"This list appears to be an effort by Lutsenko to inoculate himself for why he did not pursue corrupt [former] associates and political allies,\" Kent said, adding that Lutsenko wanted \"to claim that the U.S. told him not to.\"\n\n\"Complete poppycock,\" Kent added.\n\nNevertheless, two weeks later, Giuliani went on Fox News to claim Mueller\u2019s \"phony investigation\" stemmed from Yovanovitch.\n\nThen, in early May, The New York Times published a story with the headline: \"Biden Faces Conflict of Interest Questions That Are Being Promoted by Trump and Allies.\"\n\nTrump retweeted it. And six days later, the Trump administration announced that Yovanovitch was being recalled as U.S. ambassador.\n\nIn announcing the charges against Parnas and Fruman on Thursday, the head of the FBI\u2019s field office in New York, Bill Sweeney, said, \"The American people expect and deserve an election process that has not been corrupted by the influence of foreign interests.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
