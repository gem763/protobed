Seven were saved, two missed the target and a remarkable 19 went straight into the wall.\n\nHe wasted two more attempts during Tuesday\u2019s Champions League match against Lokomotiv Moscow, prompting a wave of criticism on social media and in Juventus blogs, especially as the team has two other expert free kick specialists \u2014 Miralem Pjanic and Paulo Dybala.\n\nSarri gave little attention to the problem when asked about it at a news conference on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe free kicks? We have two right-footed options on the pitch: him (Pjanic) and Ronaldo. So they will have to decide among themselves who takes them, as happens in just about any other side,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 34-year-old had a similarly poor record with Portugal, failing with his first 44 attempts at European Championship and World Cup tournaments before finally breaking his duck in the 3-3 draw with Spain at the World Cup last year.\n\nJuventus, who lead Serie A with 22 points out of a possible 24 and are still unbeaten since Sarri took over in the close season, visit promoted Lecce on Saturday.\n\nSarri said that Ronaldo would have to rest at some point, but could not say when.\n\n\u201cEven he will have to take a break, but I don\u2019t know when,\u201d said the coach. \u201cI speak to him every day, about how he feels on the pitch and (about) the numbers that come from the doctors and fitness coaches at the end of the match. We will make the decision based on how he feels.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri will not intervene to stop Cristiano Ronaldo taking free-kicks within scoring range, he said Friday, despite the Portuguese forward\u2019s a dismal record for the Turin side.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Marri.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
