Since this time Dr. Josh Bloom, our director of chemical pharmaceutical research, has published about 20 newspaper op-eds on the mismanagement of opioid policy and 65 articles for the ACSH site.\n\nWe are publishing his works as a media reference guide. To simplify the search for a specific topic we have divided his writings into 8 broad categories, A through G, which are indicated in parentheses after the title. Many articles fall into multiple categories.\n\nWe believe that some of these articles represent groundbreaking material that was not previously covered by other writers. These are bolded.\n\nArticle Categorization:\n\n- Intentional manipulation of statistics and lies that created a false narrative of the opioid crisis - The demonization of opioid drugs and other controlled substances - Opioid alternatives \u2013 plusses and minuses - Denial of pain relief - Flawed public policy - Fentanyl and its analogs - Flawed studies and faulty media reporting - General bad science\n\n*Bold - Key article\n\nThe Great Opioid Shakedown of 2019 Will Be a Pyrrhic 'Victory (E)\n\nhttps://www.acsh.org/news/2019/08/28/great-opioid-shakedown-2019-will-be-pyrrhic-victory-14252\n\nThe Lunacy Continues - Now It's Music Instead Of Sedatives Before Surgery (B)\n\nhttps://www.acsh.org/news/2019/08/04/lunacy-continues-now-its-music-instead-sedatives-surgery-14195\n\nFlorida Officials Successfully Withheld Pain Meds From Surgical Patients.
