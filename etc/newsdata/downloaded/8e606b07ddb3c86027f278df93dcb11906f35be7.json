The players were wearing shirts that read \u201cChains, Tattoos, Dreads, & WE ARE\u201d before they were taken away.\n\nEX-PENN STATE STAR SUGGESTS LETTER OVER PLAYER'S DREADLOCKS SHOWS SOME FANS YEARN FOR JOE PATERNO ERA\n\nCoach James Franklin was upset that his players did not discuss the T-shirts before they decided to wear them, according to ESPN. The coach also thought the shirts were unnecessary because the team had already addressed the matter earlier in the week.\n\n\u201cWhile we are supportive of our students expressing themselves in a thoughtful manner, they are expected to wear team-issued apparel on game day,\u201d Penn State said in a statement released during the game. \u201cWe asked our students to remove the shirts out of an abundance of caution for NCAA compliance.\u201d\n\nThe letter in question criticized Sutherland\u2019s appearance.\n\n\u201cSurely there must be mirrors in the locker room! Don\u2019t you have parents or girlfriend who\u2019ve told you those shoulder length dreadlocks look disgusting and are certainly not attractive,\" the letter read.\n\nPENN STATE'S JAMES FRANKLIN GIVES STRONG MESSAGE IN DEFENSE OF PLAYER DENOUNCED FOR HAIRSTYLE\n\n\u201cWe congratulate you on your game against Pitt but you need to remember you represent all Penn Staters both current and those alumni from years past. We would welcome the reappearance of dress codes for athletes.\u201d\n\nThe letter, which was signed by a fan named Dave Peterson, finally said he and his wife had stopped watching the NFL \u201cdue to the disgusting tattoos, awful hair and immature antics in the end zone. Players should act as though they\u2019ve \u2018been there before.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe letter was widely condemned and Franklin himself gave an impassioned speech supporting the player earlier this week.\n\n\u201cThe football that I know and love brings people together and embraces differences \u2013 black, white, brown, Catholic, Jewish or Muslim, rich or poor, rural or urban, Republican or Democrat. Long hair, short hair, no hair, they're all in that locker room together,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cTeams all over this country are the purest form of humanity that we have. We don't judge, we embrace differences. We live. We learn. We grow. We support and we defend each other. We're a family.\u201d\n\nSutherland released his own statement on the issue as well.\n\n\u201cAlthough the message was indeed rude, ignorant, and judging, I've taken no personal offense to it because personally, I must respect (him) as a person before I respect your opinion,\u201d Sutherland wrote in a statement posted onto his Twitter account. \u201cAt the end of the day, without an apology needed, I forgive this individual because I'm nowhere close to being perfect, and I expect God to forgive me for all the wrong I've done in my life.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nPeterson told the Tribune-Democrat that he didn\u2019t intend his letter to be a cultural or racial statement.\n\nPenn State won Saturday\u2019s game 17-12. Sutherland had one tackle.", "description": "Penn State football players wore shirts supporting teammate Jonathan Sutherland before Saturday\u2019s game against Iowa but\u00a0the\u00a0shirts were quickly\u00a0taken away.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
