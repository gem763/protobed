The announcement -- which was quickly matched by rival TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. after markets closed -- sent shock waves across Wall Street. Shares of E*Trade Financial Corp. slumped 16%, while TD Ameritrade lost more than a quarter of its stock market value. Schwab\u2019s share price also took a hit, tumbling nearly 10%.\n\nThe gambit is just the latest in an intensifying, industry-wide war over fees for everything from stock trades to index funds and financial advice. And it\u2019s squeezing not only the likes of Schwab, but also BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments. These types of aggressive price cuts -- admittedly a small boon for ordinary Americans routinely nickel-and-dimed by financial firms -- have some observers wondering whether anyone can win in a business where more and more services are handed out for free.\n\nFor Schwab, it\u2019s a bold, but risky move. The firm, which relies less on trading commissions than its competitors, is betting it can offset any decline of revenue by attracting more clients. It can then use their assets to generate interest income, an essential feature of its business that\u2019s come under pressure recently as interest rates have declined.\n\n\u201cMaybe because of the inception and growth spurt of online brokers during the dot-com boom, there\u2019s a romanticization of the individual trader,\u201d said Michael Wong, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. \u201cThere\u2019s still a mindset among the investing public around the importance of commissions,\u201d which is less important to Schwab.\n\nWhile trading costs have declined across the board, Schwab comes from a position of relative strength. The firm takes in just 7% of its net revenue from commissions. That\u2019s far less than Interactive Brokers Group Inc. or TD Ameritrade, which both collect more than a third from trading fees.\n\nSchwab estimated it could lose up to $400 million in revenue a year from its zero-fee offering. Wong said that in the current rate environment, the firm would need roughly $20 billion or more in new deposits to offset that loss. Currently, over half of Schwab\u2019s net revenue comes from interest earned on its assets. The firm, which oversaw $3.72 trillion as of Aug. 31, took in almost $20 billion in net new assets that month.\n\nSchwab last cut its trading commissions in February 2017, when it reduced them to $4.95 per trade from $6.95 to match Fidelity. Since then, assets at the firm have grown by about $800 billion from a combination of market gains and net new inflows.\n\nNevertheless, the company is looking for ways to reduce costs internally. Last month, Schwab said it would cut 600 jobs, or about 3% of its workforce, because of the \u201cincreasingly challenging economic environment.\u201d\n\nIts latest move builds on an increasingly aggressive, slash-and-burn approach to price reductions. Late Tuesday, TD Ameritrade said it would match Schwab\u2019s no-fee trading offer at a cost of as much as $240 million a quarter, or roughly 16% of its net revenue. Interactive Brokers announced just last week that it would provide free trades. And in recent months, Fidelity, Vanguard Group and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have all taken steps to eliminate fees and commissions on some offerings.\n\nAccording to Schwab Chief Financial Officer Peter Crawford, zero commissions are an inevitable industry trend. Schwab is just trying to get ahead of that.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing new firms trying to enter our market -- using zero or low equity commissions as a lever,\u201d Crawford wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re not feeling competitive pressure from these firms ... yet. But we don\u2019t want to fall into the trap that a myriad of other firms in a variety of industries have fallen into and wait too long to respond to new entrants. It has seemed inevitable that commissions would head towards zero, so why wait?\u2019\n\nThe developments show just how online stock trading is becoming a commoditized business. As a result, Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities, says brokerages will need to use their platforms to generate revenue from other services. Those include securities lending, charging asset managers fees to offer their funds, and advisory services.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Not too long ago, Charles Schwab Corp. helped to usher in the golden age of low-cost, online stock trading.Now, the brokerage may help to kill off the fee-based business model altogether.On Tuesday, Schwab said it will eliminate trading commissions on all U.S. stocks and exchange traded", "authors": ["Annie Massa", "John Gittelsohn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xtu2AHhTUJ2CjodRBWSlpQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/b522d12ead9bfadfd82f19a66170a3fa", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
