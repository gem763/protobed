REUTERS/Juan Medina\n\nNow 93, Nicolas Sanchez-Albornoz was forced as a prisoner of the Franco regime to help build the Valley of the Fallen, the mausoleum that has been the dictator\u2019s resting place since his death in 1975.\n\n\u201cIt was time (to move him). It was overdue,\u201d retired historian Sanchez-Albornoz told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve waited many decades for (Franco) to disappear from this monument, which ... was the shame of Spain. All the dictators of Franco\u2019s ilk have vanished from Europe - Hitler, Mussolini - and were not honoured with such tombs.\u201d\n\nIn a carefully choreographed ceremony, Franco\u2019s remains will be removed from the Valley of the Fallen and reburied in a family plot under a plan ratified by a divided parliament and approved last month by Spain\u2019s Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1947, with the civil war that convulsed the country from 1936 to 1939 still fresh in collective memory, a military court sentenced Sanchez-Albornoz to forced labour for membership of an anti-Fascist student association.\n\nFour months later he escaped to France with the help of compatriots exiled there who, he recalled, provided him with false papers, cash and a car they borrowed from U.S. novelist and liberal activist Norman Mailer, who was touring Europe at the time.\n\n\u201cSpain at the cusp of 1948 was still one huge jail,\u201d he said. \u201cDriving down the road, there were military police barricades every 20 kilometres (12 miles) who would stop you and ask for your papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI SEE THIS AS A BEGINNING\u201d\n\nSanchez-Albornoz was one of the lucky ones.\n\nMany of his fellow prisoners died and were buried in the valley, along with other opposition activists - and he hopes the removal of Franco\u2019s remains might open the door to using modern forensic techniques to identify some other bodies it contains.\n\n\u201cSome might think that Franco\u2019s exhumation is the end of a phase. I see this as the beginning of one,\u201d he said in his Madrid apartment.\n\n\u201cMany more exhumations await, of those who were executed by the regime or moved there against or without families\u2019 permission. Families have requested their bodies be returned, so they can be buried with their kin, in their home towns.\u201d\n\nWithout such an effort, he believes Spain will struggle to come to terms with Franco\u2019s still divisive legacy.\n\nAnd while he tolerates those who oppose the exhumation, his hostility towards Franco remains acute.\n\n\u201cHe should not have been buried in the first place. He should have suffered the same fate as his victims,\u201d he said.\n\nSanchez-Albornoz views the millions of euros successive government have spent maintaining the mausoleum as an \u201cinexplicable contradiction\u201d between democracy in theory and practice.\n\nHe refers to the valley only by its pre-Franco name of Cuelgamuros and describes his relationship with it as special - \u201ca place of imprisonment, but also of liberation.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s governing Socialists have long sought to turn it into a memorial to the around 500,000 civil war dead.\n\nBut should the mass graves ever be exhumed and victims\u2019 remains returned to their ancestors, Sanchez-Albornoz favours a simpler fate. \u201cLet nature take charge of that place\u2019s destiny,\u201d he said.", "description": "For one activist jailed by Spain's Fascists for his political views, Thursday's exhumation and reburial of Francisco Franco's bones after decades lying in state marks a bittersweet moment.", "authors": ["Clara-Laeila Laudette", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444403150&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0F6", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
