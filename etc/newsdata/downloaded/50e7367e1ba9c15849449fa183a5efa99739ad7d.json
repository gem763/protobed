Kicking is a thankless task and Maher drew the ire of the fans in the aftermath, despite Dak Prescott faltering for so long as Aaron Rodgers piled up a 31-3 lead.\n\nMaher dethroned Dan Bailey last season, to the dismay of many in Dallas who had grown to adore him over seven seasons. A cheaper option with the upside to thump the ball between the sticks from distances most teams would punt from, Maher quickly justified the decision.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The particular nature of being a kicker is that a poor run of form may not just result in you coming off the field, but brutally being cast out to the streets.\n\nJerry Jones admitted this week that Dallas have been \u201cspoiled\u201d with their trust in the past with Bailey, and instead of heaping pressure on Maher, Jason Garrett\u2018s side should just \u201cget it in the end zone\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

You can\u2019t control the weather, the field conditions, being away or home, night or day.\n\n\u201cHe needs to own his work bench, define that area where the ball is put down; define it, train it, own it.
