They did, and through process of elimination, she discovered the identity of the culprit.\n\nIn the most dramatic overuse of ellipsis I have ever seen, Coleen revealed that the leak came from \u2018\u2026\u2026\u2026.Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo give an anthropological observation on the Rooney drama, the statement wasn\u2019t given through a legal team or PR agency, but via the very modern method of a screenshot of her Notes app.\n\nOnce a tool for writing innocuous grocery lists, it is now synonymous with some of the most infamous public statements.\n\nThe 140-character limit on Twitter forced public figures to look elsewhere for lengthy announcements, and the Notes app stepped up to the plate and has become the preferred method of submitting evidence to the court of public opinion.\n\nGone are the days when notes were written on the back of receipts, the envelope of an unopened bill or \u2013 heaven forbid \u2013 in a notebook. Instead, our mobile phones hold our deepest darkest secrets and the inner workings of our weird little minds.\n\nI will never really know the meaning behind my 24 July entry at 3.05am titled \u2018Do. Do-do, do-do (whispers)\u2019 (Picture: Getty/Metro.co.uk)\n\nMy phone notes are a concoction of drunk ideas, contextless musings and messages to ex-boyfriends that they will never read.\n\nSometimes a journal, sometimes a to-do list, but mostly a collection of late-night jottings I don\u2019t understand. I will never really know the meaning behind my 24 July entry at 3.05am titled \u2018Do. Do-do, do-do (whispers)\u2019 \u2013 and that\u2019s probably a good thing.\n\nBut when it comes to public figures, among the confidential detritus are notes curated for the attention of the world.\n\nThe app programmers could only have dreamed that their software would be used to make such important announcements \u2013 the joy of a pregnancy, the sadness of a resignation or my personal favourite: the shame of a public apology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe past couple of years have given us such classic apologies such as \u2018The Ja Rule Fyre Fest Fiasco\u2019, Lena Dunham\u2019s \u2018I Promise I\u2019m Still a Feminist\u2019 f*ck-up and Logan Paul\u2019s \u2018I Didn\u2019t Think Filming A Dead Man Was Insensitive #subscribe\u2019.\n\nSuch pleas have become so commonplace that the Notes app should come with a Microsoft Word-style paperclip assistant to guide the rich and famous: \u2018It looks like you\u2019re making a public apology, how can I help?\u2019.\n\nAlthough Rooney\u2019s statement was far from an apology, it utilises the same medium which, from a PR perspective, makes it sound all the more genuine and heartfelt. It makes it more \u2018human\u2019 with that \u2018she\u2019s just like us\u2019 appeal.\n\nMy guess is that a PR team probably helped draft the message. It cleverly avoids directly accusing Mrs Vardy, stating that is was her account that was responsible for passing on information rather than Rebekah herself and therefore avoiding a potentially messy libel case.\n\nVardy responded with, you guessed it, another Notes app screenshot.\n\nWritten in a font familiar to those who follow celebrity news, she opens her statement with \u2018As I have just said to you on the phone\u2026\u2019 which leads me to believe that either Rooney suffers from short-term memory loss or what\u2019s about to follow is all for our benefit.\n\nShe goes on to explain that other people have had access to her Instagram account over the years, (widening the suspect pool), she doesn\u2019t need the money (lack of motive) and that she\u2019s currently heavily pregnant (compassionate grounds). She ended it with an emoji: the cornerstone of any relatable public statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy hot take on the story is thus: it\u2019s probably quite easy to hack an Instagram account and hackers have done a lot worse for a lot less, so as compelling as the drama may be, an immoral technophile could be to blame.\n\nThere is one great irony to this scandal and it involves the newspaper in question. It retracted the false stories it had printed and missed out on the exclusive as Coleen went public on her own.\n\nThe only money-making scoop left is the confirmation of the true identity of the leak, which would mean betraying the informant.\n\nSomething tells me the journalist in question won\u2019t be revealing their sources anytime soon, but perhaps they\u2019ve already prepared a statement just in case\u2026\u2026\u2026. somewhere in their notes.\n\nMORE: Dear advertisers, stop trying to sell me Kylie Jenner\u2019s face\n\nMORE: In a time when we share (almost) everything on social media, the Notes app is the most intimate look into someone\u2019s soul\n\nMORE: Shame, insecurity and stress poos: the \u2018glamorous\u2019 world of showbiz isn\u2019t what you think\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "This week Coleen Rooney announced, via her Notes app, that one of her followers had been leaking fake stories to the press.", "authors": ["Nicola Thorp", "Actor", "Equality Campaigner"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89114567_1570786765.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
