(Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)\n\nAn Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge will decide next month whether prosecutors handling the case against accused Capital Gazette shooter Jarrod Ramos should be sanctioned for allegedly failing to disclose possible evidence.\n\nDefense attorneys for Ramos have accused the Anne Arundel County state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office of withholding emails detailing concerns raised about his social media activity in 2014 \u2014 four years before Ramos was charged in the mass shooting that left five newspaper employees dead in Maryland. Defense attorneys also suggested prosecutors misrepresented what actions prosecutors took to investigate Ramos in connection with the 2014 complaints.\n\nState\u2019s Attorney Anne Colt Leitess pushed back against the allegations, calling them \u201cbald faced\u201d and \u201cwithout merit.\u201d\n\nThe request for sanctions \u2014 including a request to possibly force Leitess to recuse herself from the trial \u2014 played out in an acrimonious clash in court Thursday.\n\nRamos, 39, is accused of blasting through the newspaper offices of the Capital Gazette on June 28, 2018, and killing five: editorial page editor Gerald Fisch\u00adman, 61; assistant editor Rob Hiaasen, 59; sportswriter, reporter and editor John McNamara, 56; sales assistant Rebecca Smith, 34; and reporter Wendi Winters, 65. Prosecutors say Ramos attacked the newsroom after losing a defamation suit against the paper for a story it ran about Ramos pleading guilty to harassing a former high school classmate.\n\nRamos has pleaded \u201cnot criminally responsible,\u201d Maryland\u2019s version of an insanity defense, citing a mental disorder.\n\nThe request for sanctions by Ramos\u2019s attorneys turns on emails lawyer Kathleen Kirchner sent to Leitess\u2019s office in 2014. Kirchner is the brother of lawyer Brennan McCarthy, who represented a woman harassed by Ramos. Ramos pleaded guilty in 2011 to the harassment.\n\nNewsroom coverage of the harassment case fueled long-standing anger Ramos had toward the publication, which Ramos sued for defamation in a case he lost, prosecutors have said.\n\nAfter his plea, Ramos sued McCarthy\u2019s client and began making threats on social media against McCarthy and Kirchner, according to court filings.\n\nWorried about herself and her brother, Kirchner asked her husband, who conducts threat assessments as part of his profession, to review Ramos's writings and social media feeds. Her husband determined Ramos was fixated on her and her brother and told them to immediately disengage with Ramos because they could be targets for violence, Kirchner said in court Thursday.\n\n[The Capital Gazette shooting, one year later: Survivors and loved ones gather to remember the victims]\n\nAfter her husband\u2019s review, Kirchner shared her fear in an email to Leitess\u2019s office, asking prosecutors to determine whether a crime had been committed.\n\nLeitess responded in an email that she would send the details to investigators, a promise that defense attorneys said Thursday contradicts Leitess\u2019s later representations in court that no investigation was conducted into Ramos\u2019s activity that needed to be turned over as discovery in the Capital Gazette shooting.\n\nThe evidence that should have been turned over, defense attorneys said, also includes details showing Leitess had interacted with Ramos in the years preceding the shooting and blocked him on Twitter.\n\nBecause of that history, Ramos\u2019s attorneys suggested Leitess should recuse herself from the case because she could become a possible trial witness.\n\nLeitess aggressively pushed back on the defense accusations, saying she informed them in February that Kirchner expressed worries to her office about Ramos and turned over all information it had about Ramos\u2019s Twitter activity.\n\nLeitess said she had someone in her office review Kirchner\u2019s concerns and determined there was nothing at the time her office could do but had told court security to be on the lookout for Ramos.\n\nLeitess said she did not turn over the email chain between her office and Kirchner because it didn\u2019t directly relate to the shooting at the Capital Gazette.\n\nArundel County Circuit Judge Laura S. Ripken said she will rule on the request for sanctions Oct. 2.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe lives lost in the Capital Gazette newsroom shooting\n\nInnocent man spent months in jail for bringing honey back to United States\n\nHe shot a friend and was found insane.
