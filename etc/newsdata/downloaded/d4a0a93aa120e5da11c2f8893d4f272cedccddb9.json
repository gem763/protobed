The ballet company's professional program accepts students as young as 11. (Philippa Twigg)\n\nStudents stay in a residence for the duration of the program, which emphasizes success in the classroom as much as it does discipline in the studio.\n\nTwigg didn't make the cut after the summer program in 2018, but emerged victorious this year.\n\n\"I think he can handle it, for sure,\" said his mother, Philippa, adding that she and her husband aren't nervous about their son's move \u2014 at least not yet.\n\n\"We're kind of shutting that bit off until he disappears,\" she said. \"And then it will probably all catch up with us.\"\n\nPeers 'just didn't understand'\n\nThe opportunity to train professionally at one of Canada's most famous ballet companies is particularly special for Twigg: his love for dance hasn't always been embraced by his peers.\n\n\"Many people just didn't understand what it was like to be a dancer, and there was a bit of teasing and bullying going on,\" Twigg said.\n\nThe young dancer did perform in a talent show at his school, something he thinks helped his fellow students understand his passion.\n\n\"Dance was one of the things that I just loved, and it was in me since I was so young,\" he said.\n\nHis mother agreed that Twigg's pursuit of ballet came with \"its ups and downs,\" but said she's always known her son had the ability to perform professionally.\n\n\"I'm excited to see where this journey goes and really how far he can take his dance training,\" she said. \"I think it's going to be a fantastic experience.\"", "description": "Iain Twigg is about to give up a trio of sports, several types of dance and going back to his Barrhaven school this fall \u2014 all so the 12-year-old can train with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5267272.1567388644!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/iain-twigg.jpg"}
