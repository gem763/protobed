The bill would also do away with the lower minimum wage allowable for tipped workers. That has been $2.13 since 1996.\n\nWarren, who has long supported the $15 move and is co-sponsoring the Senate version of the bill, also shared details on how she was going to enforce the minimum wage hike.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the statutory maximum penalties for these kinds of violations are laughably small and fail to adequately deter misconduct,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor example, according to the Department of Labor, the statutory maximum penalty for willful or repeated violations of minimum wage and overtime laws is just $1,000, and the statutory maximum for willful or repeated violations of child labor laws is just $10,000. I will push to substantially increase these maximum penalties so that employers don\u2019t view violations as the cost of doing business.\u201d\n\nMinimum wage hurting some businesses\n\nSome business leaders are on board. Founder of burger chain Shake Shack Danny Meyer told Yahoo Finance in July that \u201cit\u2019s probably a good idea.\u201d JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to give people more of a living wage,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance in the same month.\n\nAnd several big retailers have raised minimum wage, from Amazon to Costco to Walmart.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos emphasized the point in his annual shareholder letter back in April.\n\n\u201cToday I challenge our top retail competitors (you know who you are!) to match our employee benefits and our $15 minimum wage,\u201d he implored. \u201cDo it! Better yet, go to $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us. It\u2019s a kind of competition that will benefit everyone.\u201d\n\nWest Palm Beach, CityPlace, Brio Tuscan Grille outdoor tables.

In reality, it will eliminate jobs and decrease incomes for workers with the fewest skills and least experience.\u201d", "description": "According to her newly-released \u201cEmpowering American Workers and Raising Wages\u201d plan, the Democratic Massachusetts Senator noted that she wanted to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers, including tipped workers and workers with disabilities.", "authors": ["Aarthi Swaminathan", "Finance Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rMic3YHm5vnmcfyldXrf8Q--~B/aD05MDI7dz0xMjY2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/dc6487a0-e5e8-11e9-a97f-cf074aad62bc", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
