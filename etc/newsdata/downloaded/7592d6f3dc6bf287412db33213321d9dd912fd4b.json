He\u2019ll soon be returning to the medium with a \u201cpop-up line\u201d for DC Comics.\n\nThe announcement comes just a couple of days after DC announced that it was rebranding its comic lines along age groups, effectively shuttering well-known comic brands like Vertigo. While it seems as though its adult-oriented comics will live under the company\u2019s DC Black Label line, the company is open to straying from that structure for specific creators in instances like this.\n\nHill will oversee Hill House Comics, which will publish five miniseries, two of which he\u2019s set to write: Basketful of Heads (written by Hill and illustrated by Leomacs), The Dollhouse Family, (written by Mike Carey and illustrated by Peter Gross), The Low, Low Woods, (written by Carmen Maria Machado and illustrated by Dani), Daphne Byrne (written by Laura Marks and illustrated by Kelley Jones), and Plunge (written by Hill with an illustrator to be announced later). Hill will also contribute a regular feature called Sea Dogs, which will be included in each book. The first installment of Basketful of Heads will be released on October 31st, with the others to follow.\n\nRelated Joe Hill on writing horror in an era of Twitter and toxic politics\n\nFor fans of Hill\u2019s work, this is excellent news, especially considering that he\u2019s been away from comics for a little while. His best-known story (co-created with artist Gabriel Rodr\u00edguez), Locke & Key, ran from 2008 through 2013. It followed the Locke family as they relocated to their family\u2019s ancestral home in Lovecraft, Maine, following a tragedy. There, the family\u2019s children discover that the house sits atop a portal to another dimension, with keys scattered around the house that grant their users special powers. The story is an excellent example of what can be done with the medium. Hill and Rodr\u00edguez experiment with comic genres and art styles over the course of the series.\n\nHill\u2019s new line of comics feels as though it\u2019s going to do some similar things. EW says that Basketful of Heads will follow a young woman and her boyfriend who discover that the mansion they\u2019re watching is loaded with Viking artifacts. When they experience a break-in, she discovers that an axe has particular powers. Hill also notes that his other comic, Plunge, is his \u201cchance to riff on one of the greatest horror films of all time, John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing,\u201d which is about a research vessel in the Arctic that reappears after vanishing 40 years ago.\n\nThe comics won\u2019t be the only thing we see from Hill this fall: he\u2019s got a collection of short stories called Full Throttle coming out in October as well. Presumably, there be some interest in adaptations down the line for this imprint: AMC just released an adaptation of Joe Hill\u2019s novel NOS4A2, and Netflix is currently filming an adaptation of Locke & Key.", "description": "Author Joe Hill is known for his horror novels like NOS4A2, The Fireman, Heart-Shaped Box, and others, but he\u2019s also known for co-creating the fantastic horror series Locke & Key for IDW.
