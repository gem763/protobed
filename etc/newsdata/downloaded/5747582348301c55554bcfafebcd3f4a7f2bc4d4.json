(AP) - What Aaron Jones did on Sunday is exactly what coach Matt LaFleur envisioned for the running game when he took over the reins of the Packers in January.\n\nJones had 116 yards and a touchdown on a career-high 23 carries in Green Bay\u2019s 21-16 win over the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n\u201cHe did an unbelievable job,\u201d LaFleur said Monday of the third-year running back. \u201cMatter of fact, he was our player of the game on offense. He did a great job. But I thought it really started up front, too. I thought our offensive line did a really nice job blocking for him.\u201d\n\nAfter totaling just 39 yards rushing at Chicago in the season opener, Jones eclipsed the 100-yard mark on the ground for the fourth time in his career and the first time since Week 10 of last season.\n\nWhile the spotlight will be on LaFleur and Aaron Rodgers this season, LaFleur has maintained that in order for the offense to be as efficient and effective as he wants, the run game has to be established early and often.\n\nJones also had four catches for 34 yards, including a 15-yard gain on a grab with the Green Bay offense backed up to its end zone.\n\n\u201cWins aren\u2019t pretty in the NFL, but as long as you get that W in the win column, that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d Jones said.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe secret is out: The Packers have a really good defense.\n\nThe defense, for the second straight week, carried the team to victory. Coordinator Mike Pettine\u2019s group forced four turnovers on Sunday and now has the NFL\u2019s No. 2 scoring defense, behind only the Patriots. Green Bay has allowed 19 points through the first two games, its fewest through the first two weeks since 2001.\n\n\u201cShoot, I mean, it feels good,\u201d second-year cornerback Jaire Alexander said. \u201cYou got everybody bringing that swag, everybody bringing that juice and we see the results. Sacks, hurries and interceptions.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S NOT WORKING\n\nThe offense (kind of). After scoring touchdowns on each of their first three possessions Sunday, the Packers failed to get points on their next 11 drives. The offense continued to look out of sync despite doing enough to keep Green Bay unbeaten.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done as well as we\u2019d like to on the offensive side of the ball, but I still have a lot of confidence in the players that we have out there,\u201d LaFleur said.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nJones said before the season that he felt \u201cslept on.\u201d Well, not anymore. After his performance Sunday, and a coach in LaFleur who is bound and determined to get Jones and the running game going, the 2017 fifth-round pick is primed to be the Packers\u2019 first 1,000-yard rusher since Eddie Lacy in 2014.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nLeft guard Lane Taylor\u2019s snap numbers suggest the seventh-year veteran is losing his grip on the starting job. Green Bay drafted guard Elgton Jenkins in the second round in April and the rookie impressed throughout the summer. Jenkins stole some of Taylor\u2019s snaps on Sunday, and LaFleur said it\u2019s a \u201cfluid competition\u201d between the two.\n\nINJURED\n\nSafety Raven Greene (ankle) was placed on injured reserve on Monday. Greene was carted off the field on Sunday following the first play of the second half.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n343 - Sunday marked the 343rd consecutive regular-season sellout at Lambeau Field.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nGreen Bay will host the Broncos on Sunday. The Packers are 6-7-1 against Denver, which is 0-2 following a loss to the Raiders in their season opener and a last-second defeat against Chicago in Week 2.\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "What Aaron Jones did on Sunday is exactly what coach Matt LaFleur envisioned for the running game when he took over the reins of the Packers in January.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/aptopix_vikings_packers_football_15059_c0-328-4870-3167_s1770x1032.jpg?49f9daca45d573902d2b9091b3382bc7dfe1d4d1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
