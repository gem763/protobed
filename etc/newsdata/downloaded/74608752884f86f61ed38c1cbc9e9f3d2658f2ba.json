She just starred in the acclaimed Luce as a teacher who suspects one of her students is acting out against her, and now she\u2019s starring in the show Truth Be Told, about an imprisoned murderer she suspects was wrongly convicted. A problem for her is that, as true-crime podcaster and journalist Poppy Parnell, her reporting on that murder may have been instrumental in sending an innocent man (Aaron Paul) to jail. 18 years after the trial that made her famous, Poppy isn\u2019t so sure Warren Cave, played by Paul, is actually a killer, but she\u2019s going to have to wade through nearly two decades of buried lies, family secrets, and rich-people problems in the San Francisco Bay Area to find the truth. The limited series is set to debut on Apple TV+ on December 6, and it co-stars Lizzy Caplan, Mekhi Phifer, Tracie Thoms, and Ron Cephas Jones.\n\nRelated", "description": "In the trailer for Truth Be Told, Octavia Spencer stars as a true crime podcaster named Poppy Parnell and she is trying to find the truth about the murder that made her a star when she reported on it years ago.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/10/10-truth-be-told-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
