She\u2019s just been laughed out of the office by the snobbish lads of an indie rock magazine, having submitted an agonizingly earnest review of the Annie soundtrack for print in their alt-weekly. She\u2019s perched under the sinks when she hears a voice: It\u2019s Bj\u00f6rk, coming alive inside a framed poster on the bathroom wall. \u201cRooms like that need girls like you,\u201d the musician coos to Johanna, urging her to turn around and tell \u2018em all off. In Feldstein\u2019s newest starring vehicle How to Build a Girl, everyone\u2014even Bj\u00f6rk\u2014is rooting for her.\n\nIt isn\u2019t hard to see why. So far, Feldstein\u2019s Hollywood persona has always been half of a duo\u2014weeping to boy bands beside Saoirse Ronan\u2019s Lady Bird or showering compliments upon Kaitlyn Dever\u2019s Amy in Booksmart. But in How to Build, Feldstein\u2019s Johanna goes at it solo. She\u2019s an ambitious teen who hails from the shabby city of Wolverhampton, England, and dresses like an overzealous cabaret extra: top hat, fishnets, Cleopatra eyeliner. As the newest addition to the Feldstein repertoire, Johanna is an equally shiny firecracker\u2014she\u2019s just a lone one.\n\n\u201cI was like, where is my buddy? I\u2019m so used to being on a set with my girl,\u201d Feldstein says of tackling the role. \u201cI went directly from being in LA, living with Kaitlyn on Booksmart, to three days later living in Wolverhampton. It was a very quick turnaround.\u201d\n\nAdapted from Caitlin Moran\u2019s autobiographical novel, How to Build follows Johanna, a \u201890s British teen who acts as the movie\u2019s titular build-a-girl and center of gravity. We meet her in a daydream: She\u2019s bored sick by her drab existence, doodling in the library and fantasizing about a life worthy of a romance novel. Her reverie becomes reality when she pursues and somehow scores a plum job as a rock music critic, and the rest of the film busies itself with charting the highs and lows of her Cinderella-as-catty-journalist success story.\n\nLacking a sidekick, Johanna receives encouragement from a cast of imaginary mentors and cheerleaders: Sylvia Plath, Julie Andrews, Sigmund Freud, Jo March\u2014each of whom hang in magazine clippings on her bedroom wall and, like Bj\u00f6rk, come alive to egg her on. \u201cIt is really the story of a girl who doesn\u2019t have a best friend, and also doesn\u2019t really have her mother present,\u201d Feldstein says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have anyone telling her to maybe take the top hat off, or maybe not kiss that guy.\u201d\n\nUnlike Johanna, Feldstein is seemingly surrounded by friends. She\u2019s part of a core young Hollywood cohort, including prominent names like her Lady Bird costar Lucas Hedges and her \u201creal-life best friend\u201d Ben Platt. Together with Platt, Feinstein will star in the film adaptation of Merrily We Roll Along, an ambitious production from Richard Linklater set to shoot in increments over the next two decades. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for 2040,\u201d Feldstein laughs when asked about the project. \u201cI think it makes people really reckon with their own humanity in a funny way. I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry to make you think about 20 years from now!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c I\u2019m honored to be a part of bringing this story to light right now, and hopefully getting to frame her in a completely new way for the next generation. \u201d\n\nBut these shared projects and tight-knit group of friends, Feldstein insists, haven\u2019t stopped her from worshipping her own Johanna-esque wall of idols. These include Barbra Streisand and Eleanor Roosevelt (\u201cI\u2019m, like, obsessed with her\u201d), Carole King and Stephen Sondheim (\u201cthe soundtrack to my life\u201d), and also Sandra Oh, who Feldstein tried to stalk after finding out How to Build was shooting in the same London building as Killing Eve (\u201cOh, Cristina Yang? There is no one better in the world\u201d).\n\nSoon, Feldstein will have the chance to play another, more polarizing modern icon: Monica Lewinsky. The role will appear in the third season of American Crime Story, which is set, rather audaciously, to tackle the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Alongside Feldstein, Lewinsky herself will help produce.\n\n\u201cShe is a triumph,\u201d Feldstein says of the former White House intern and current activist. \u201cI am so, so honored to be portraying her. And to be doing it with Ryan Murphy is out of my wildest dreams. He is sort of the king of television, and his work is so profound.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a chewy role for a Hollywood up-and-comer, providing the one-two punch of propelling Feldstein\u2019s career while shaping the public perception of a real-life woman\u2014one who, despite finally being offered a voice in the triumphant wake of #MeToo, still tends to be a punchline for many a Twitter troll. To make matters more complex, the new season is set to premiere on FX in September 2020, just weeks before the election.\n\n\u201cThe facts and the details are all exactly as they\u2019ve always been, and yet we see it completely differently now,\u201d Feldstein says, reflecting on the all-too-familiar scandal. \u201cI\u2019m honored to be a part of bringing this story to light right now, and hopefully getting to frame her in a completely new way for the next generation.\u201d\n\nProduction for the season will begin in January, and Feldstein has already had a few phone calls with Lewinsky, who she describes as \u201cridiculously wonderful\u201d to speak to. \u201cI have 100,000 questions for her,\u201d she vows, adding that with Lewinsky signed on as a producer, \u201cIt\u2019ll be really incredible to watch someone be a part of telling their own story.\u201d\n\nPlaying a version of Caitlin Moran in How to Build, Feinstein reflects, was a useful stepping stone to her work on American Crime Story. Like Lewinsky, Moran is \u201ca feminist hero\u201d and real woman who Feldstein could dig into and make her own. And as Feldstein continues to graduate as an actress\u2014moving on up from supportive friend, to bookish ringleader, to independent artist, to polarizing public figure\u2014it surely won\u2019t be long before we\u2019re enthroning Feldstein with feminist-hero status of her own.", "description": "Coming off a buzzy starring role in the Toronto Film Festival\u2019s \u2018How to Build a Girl,\u2019 the \u2018Booksmart\u2019 breakout is ready to graduate to the meatiest roles of her career.", "authors": ["Natalia Winkelman"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568690215/unnamed_18_r4df5z", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
