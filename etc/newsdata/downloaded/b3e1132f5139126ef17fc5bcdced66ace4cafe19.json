Still, business spending declined for the second quarter in a row. Investment in structures dropped sharply, particularly those related to the petroleum and natural gas industries. Equipment spending on aircraft also decreased amid the continuing grounding of Boeing Co.'s 737 MAX jetliner.\n\nThe Commerce Department report showed the divergence between relatively solid consumer spending and falling business investment continued from the second quarter into the third, as the long-simmering trade war with China escalated. The report came hours ahead of a scheduled rate announcement from policy makers at the Federal Reserve, who conclude a two-day policy meeting later Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank cut interest rates twice in the third quarter. Officials are expected to again cut the benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point, to a range between 1.50% and 1.75%, aiming to shield the economy against growing risks of a sharper economic slowdown.\n\nCompared with the third quarter a year ago, output grew 2.0% -- the weakest quarterly year-over-year rate since the final quarter of 2016.\n\nConsumer spending moderated to a 2.9% annual rate in the third quarter, from a 4.6% rate in the second. From a year earlier, consumer spending increased 2.5% in the third quarter, roughly consistent with the pace over the past year.\n\nConsumers are the lifeblood of the U.S. economy, as their spending accounts for nearly 70% of output. The report showed their spending on big-ticket items such as cars and appliances slowed but remained strong, while spending on services slowed.\n\nThe slower pace of consumer spending in the third quarter came despite a solid financial foundation for many U.S. households. The unemployment rate was at half-century lows from July to September, and wages and incomes rose. Consumer sentiment has remained strong in recent months and rose slightly in October, according to the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers.\n\nThe housing sector was a tailwind for growth as residential investment rose at a 5.1% annual pace. The boost, which followed six straight quarters of declines, likely reflected lower short-term interest rates propelling construction and improvements.\n\nThe Commerce Department data also offered evidence of slowing corporate demand. Nonresidential fixed investment -- which reflects business spending on software, research and development, equipment and structures -- fell at a 3.0% rate.\n\nBusiness-investment data can be volatile from one quarter to another, but the weak number in the latest report suggests factors including political uncertainty and the outlook for trade tariffs are weighing on business decisions to spend on new equipment and plants.\n\nD'Anne McCumber, general manager at equipment maker Oilfield Improvements, Inc. in Broken Arrow, Okla., said \"things have slowed down just a little bit, but not severely,\" compared with the first and second quarters of this year.\n\n\"Right now people are in a bit of a holding pattern, it happens in the oil and gas industry at the beginning of a campaign year,\" she said.\n\nLow energy prices have \"definitely restricted activity and investment in the oil and gas space,\" said Aron Deen, director of marketing and business development at Fort Worth, Texas-based oil-drilling equipment maker Ulterra Drilling Technologies.\n\n\"The market buzz in oil and gas has been basically trying to restrict spending to cash flow,\" he said.\n\nThe decline in business investment is a sign that the 2017 tax law isn't having the effects its authors predicted and desired. The law cut corporate tax rates and allowed immediate deductions for capital investment, and raising the after-tax rate of return was supposed to encourage companies to spend on factories and equipment.\n\nAfter an early jump in 2018, investment has slumped. It has been dragged down by uncertainty over the trade war and global economy. In addition, companies may not see the current corporate tax rules as stable over the longer term because Democrats are proposing to raise the corporate tax rate.\n\nTrade was broadly neutral in the third quarter, as net exports subtracted a mild 0.08 percentage point from the quarter's 1.9% GDP growth rate.\n\nThe pace of exports picked up to a 0.7% annual rate after a decline in the second quarter, while the rate of imports rose by a greater amount, a 1.2% rate, as Americans stepped up purchases of foreign goods.\n\nAfter stripping out the volatile categories of trade, inventories and government spending, sales to private domestic purchasers rose at an annual rate of 2.0%, down from 3.3% in the second quarter.\n\nTotal government expenditures were up at a 2.0% annual rate in the third quarter.\n\nA measure of overall inflation suggested underlying inflation pressures remained relatively subdued by historical standards. The price index for personal-consumption expenditures increased at a 1.5% pace in the third quarter. Core prices -- which exclude food and energy -- rose at a 2.2% rate.\n\nRichard Rubin contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 11:29 ET (15:29 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
