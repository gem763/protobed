While the economy appears to be humming in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, with businesses confident about sales growth, hiring plans and investment intentions, the picture is markedly less positive in the Prairies as the energy sector struggles.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of surprisingly positive, or maybe surprisingly not all that negative,\u201d said Nathan Janzen, a senior economist with RBC told the Financial Post. \u201cI think if you look at all these indicators, they\u2019re pretty constructive for the Canadian outlook.\u201d\n\nJanzen added, \u201cThe weakness was the energy sector, and that\u2019s not that surprising, but it is surprising to see the rest of country be so resilient.\u201d\n\nGiven the rise in trade tensions since the time of the last survey in June, Jaznen said the expectation was for businesses to pull back on investment decisions.\n\nThe weakness was the energy sector, and that\u2019s not that surprising, but it is surprising to see the rest of country be so resilient Nathan Janzen, senior economist, RBC\n\nBut investment intentions actually trended higher, with a net 28 per cent of respondents indicating plans to increase spending, up from 20 per cent.\n\nBrian DePratto, a senior economist at TD Economics, noted the sales outlook remains unchanged with a net of 23 per cent of respondents predicting accelerating growth over the next 12 months.\n\nMeanwhile, the job market remains tight in Central Canada and B.C., but not the Prairie provinces where a soft energy market persists, he wrote.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the kind of report that makes you thinks, \u2018oh things are really going to take off\u2019, but it\u2019s not the kind of report that makes you think, \u2018oh no, run for the hills,\u201d DePratto told the Financial Post.\n\nRather, the report suggests \u201ca solidly middle of the road economic performance,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n\nOn interest rates, both DePratto and Janzen predicted the Bank of Canada would not cut rates at its next scheduled announcement on Oct. 30.\n\nAvery Shenfield, chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, agreed but said the picture is mixed. The economy is growing somewhere close to its non-inflationary potential in the third quarter, but sentiment is only slightly above its historic average as a result of weakness in the prairies.\n\n\u201cThe central bank\u2019s use of the word \u2018healthy\u2019 to describe hiring and capital spending intentions outside the energy provinces suggests it\u2019s not inclined to cut rates yet,\u201d Shenfield said in an email.\n\nBut he added that the results were \u201cnot very robust\u201d either.\n\nThe Bank of Canada also released its Senior Loan Officer Survey on Tuesday, which also came out mixed, with mortgage lending conditions easing but non-mortgage conditions tightening.\n\nIt also found business lending conditions remained for the most part unchanged, with things tighter in the energy-dependent provinces than the rest of the country. Demand for credit remained unchanged.\n\nDePratto said that while the reports provide an overall positive picture, there are mounting risks that are largely \u201cbeyond our borders,\u201d such as U.S.-China trade tensions and the possibility that a U.S. recession would have spillover consequences in Canada.\n\n\u201cUntil and unless the domestic data begins to meaningfully turn negative, the Bank (of Canada) will be comfortable to sit on the sidelines,\u201d DePratto wrote, \u201ceven as its advanced economy peers continue to ease their monetary policies.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: gfriedman@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GabeFriedz", "description": "Economy appears to be humming in Ontario, Quebec and B.C., but things look less positive in the Prairies as energy sector struggles", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bank-of-canada-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
