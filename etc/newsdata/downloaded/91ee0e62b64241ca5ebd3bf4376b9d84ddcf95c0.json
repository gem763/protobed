Why are they promising so many of their own?", "language": "en", "text": "Even Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar, who are running on their ability to forge compromises with Republicans, envision single-handed presidential edicts to tackle issues including climate change and gun violence.\n\nAs the Democratic candidates offer plan after plan, many are promising single-handed presidential action \u2014 rather than new laws that must be pushed through a sluggish Congress \u2014 to combat the nation\u2019s big problems.\n\nAD\n\nThat trend was particularly evident at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas Wednesday, where almost every candidate who spoke has promised some kind of executive action to bolster gun control.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDurable reform requires legislation \u2014 but right now legislation is impossible,\u201d Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, wrote in releasing her gun plan in August. \u201cWhy? A virulent mix of corruption and abuse of power.\u201d\n\nThe unilateral approach in some ways echoes President Trump\u2019s strategy, even as Democrats increasingly label him an authoritarian. The Democrats\u2019 policies would not amplify presidential power to the extent that Trump has sought to, but they do reflect a more president-centric approach to governing, a feature that\u2019s become central to Trump\u2019s tenure.\n\nAD\n\nWhile the question of presidential authority is now at center stage, the popularity of executive action in both parties began growing years ago, analysts say, driven by a growing tension between voters demanding dramatic change and a Congress increasingly paralyzed by partisanship and polarization.\n\nAD\n\nThe Democratic hopefuls whose message is more revolutionary \u2014 Warren, Sanders, a senator from Vermont, and perhaps Harris, a senator from California \u2014 are emphasizing executive action more than those who foresee a return to bipartisan cooperation. In some ways, the issue is drawing a line between candidates, such as former vice president Biden, who see Trump as an aberration, and those who believe the days of bipartisan comity may not return any time soon.\n\nSome lawmakers warn that the trend could distort the balance of powers. Biden, who served in the Senate for 36 years, is among those arguing that the legislative process, cumbersome though it may be, forces the parties to work together in ways that benefit the country.\n\nAD\n\n\u201c[The Constitution] says you have to get a consensus to get anything done,\u201d he told reporters in June. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t get a consensus, guess what? Power flows to the president, and abuse of power takes place.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRegarding the Democrats, he added, \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to come along and do the same thing [Trump] did? Not on my watch.\u201d\n\nBut even Biden\u2019s platform includes promises such as \u201con day one, Biden will sign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach\u201d to tackle climate change.\n\nPete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., made a slightly different argument against executive action at that gun control forum Wednesday when he argued that gun control is among those issues \u201ctoo important to be left to the whim of an individual president.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBecause an executive action can be reversed \u2014 and because an overwhelming majority of American people want this to get done anyway \u2014 I really feel that legislation is the best way forward,\u201d he said.\n\nPresidents dating to George Washington have used executive action, some to seismic effect. Franklin D. Roosevelt used his powers to implement key parts of the New Deal. Harry S. Truman\u2019s Executive Order 9981 integrated the U.S. Armed Forces. Both had faced congressional opposition that precluded the passage of legislation to achieve their goals.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs long as you have a divided government, you\u2019ll have executive action,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, who worked in the Clinton administration and now directs the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution. \u201cYou can think of it as poor man\u2019s legislation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut in recent years, executive action has become an increasingly common substitute for legislation. Presidents often say they\u2019re being forced to act because of Congress\u2019s paralysis. As the Senate and House have become more polarized, they have struggled to enact major bills \u2014 prompting presidential edicts on issues such as immigration and health care.\n\nThe result can be a whiplash, where each new president enacts sweeping policies only to have them abruptly reversed when the opposition takes over. That\u2019s been most evident in the much-reversed \u201cglobal gag rule,\u201d a provision banning foreign organizations that get U.S. aid from providing abortions or talking about them.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA Democrat comes in and says, \u2018Yes, we will give foreign aid to entities that perform abortions.\u2019 . . . The Republicans come in and they say, \u2018No, we\u2019re not doing that,\u2019 \u201d Kamarck said. \u201cSo things like abortion become like a ping-pong ball.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe ping-pong balls will probably increase, if Democratic rhetoric on the campaign trail is any indication. In the last debate, Harris was asked about Biden\u2019s charge that she and others were following Trump\u2019s damaging example by promising sweeping presidential actions, some of which might not be constitutional.\n\nHarris didn\u2019t directly rebut the criticism. But talking to reporters at the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention last month, she spoke of Congress\u2019s failure to tackle \u201csome of the longest-standing issues that are challenging our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the United States Congress fails to act, absolutely I\u2019m prepared to take executive action,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that will be no different than previous presidents of the United States.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn contrast, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who like Biden touts himself as a centrist who can work with Republicans, sees limits to what executive action can achieve, because by definition it shuts out the opposition.\n\n\u201cI think that executive orders can play a critical role,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t assume you\u2019re going to lead for four years \u2014 if you\u2019re actually going to lead \u2014 just by executive action. . . . You\u2019re not going to be able to substantially and sustainably move things forward if it\u2019s just by executive order.\u201d\n\nHarris, saying \u201celections matter,\u201d argues that immediate corrective action will be needed after Trump leaves office. Many Democrats consider the Trump presidency a crisis that requires an emergency response, and they\u2019ve been frustrated as the president uses his powers to do things such as transfer funds to build a U.S.-Mexico border barrier or enact rules aimed at weakening the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHarris and other candidates often say they will ask Congress to pass certain bills and will issue an executive order only if it fails to do so.\n\nBut while the candidates often talk about issuing executive actions as though it\u2019s like waving a magic presidential wand, the reality is more complicated. For all their reach and impact, executive orders only cover the activities of the federal government and its workforce, and they can take time to implement.\n\nHarris\u2019s proposed order expanding background checks on gun buyers, for example, would not instantly change the system. Instead, it would direct the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to change its interpretation of the current law requiring gun dealers to conduct background checks.\n\nBy directing ATF to classify as \u201cdealers\u201d even those who sell as few as five guns a year for profit, Harris would significantly expand the number of people covered. That would have a big effect \u2014 but the next GOP president could undo Harris\u2019s action immediately upon taking office.\n\nAD\n\nThe fight over executive action has been brewing for some time, as each new president pushes the envelope a little further. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Democrats excoriated President George W. Bush for his expansion of national security powers.\n\nObama then issued 276 executive orders in his eight years in office. That was fewer than other recent two-term presidents, but Republicans criticized the scope of Obama\u2019s actions, such as establishing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program \u2014 a sweeping bid to end the deportation of those brought to the United States illegally as children.\n\nWhen Trump took office, he seized on executive orders with particular gusto, staging televised signing ceremonies to suggest bold action on promises such as banning travel from some Muslim countries.\n\nAs Trump has tested the limits of presidential power, parts of his orders have been found unconstitutional, and some are still being litigated. Trump, propelled to office by voters looking to shake up the system, has issued 125 executive orders since his inauguration, according to the Federal Register.\n\nNow it\u2019s Democratic voters who are demanding immediate change, suggesting that for all their temporariness and shaky status, the appeal of executive actions continues to resonate with a restless electorate.\n\n\u201cLook at what happens in the first few weeks of the last two or three presidential administrations,\u201d said Phillip J. Cooper, professor of public administration at Portland State University and author of \u201cBy the Order of the President.\u201d \u201cThey walk in the door and in a period of about two months, they issue a large number of these things, to try to show their constituents that they are indeed responding to what they ran on.\u201d", "description": "Democratic presidential candidates are vowing forceful executive action \u2014 just like Trump did.
