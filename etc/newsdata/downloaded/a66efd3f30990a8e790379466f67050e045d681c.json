USA TODAY\n\nIn the wake of the college admissions scandal, actress Lori Loughlin's daughters are no longer students at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe USC Registrar said in a statement shared with USA TODAY that Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose Giannulli are not currently enrolled. The university was unable to provide additional information because of student privacy laws.\n\nThis news comes about seven months after USC confirmed that the sisters still were enrolled. In a statement shared in March, the school said: \"USC is conducting a case-by-case review for current students and graduates that may be connected to the scheme alleged by the government and will make informed decisions as those reviews are completed.\u201d\n\nLoughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of paying $500,000 to a sham nonprofit of admission scheme mastermind Rick Singer in what investigators dubbed the \"Varsity Blues\" scandal. The parents had their two daughters classified as crew recruits for the university, a move that U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani saw as especially reprehensible, because it took seats away from deserving students.\n\nLori Loughlin's daughters Olivia Jade (left) and Isabella Gianulli (right) are no longer enrolled at USC, according to the registrar, (Photo: NINA PROMMER, EPA-EFE)\n\nActress Felicity Huffman, who was sentenced last month in the scandal, was ordered to spend 14 days in prison and pay a $30,000 fine. She pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for paying $15,000 to have someone correct the SAT exam answers of her oldest daughter, Sophia.\n\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling, who spoke in a rare television interview this month,\"If (Loughlin) is convicted, I don't think I'm giving away any state secrets by saying we would probably ask for a higher sentence for her than we did for Felicity Huffman,\" he said. \"The longer the case goes, let's say she goes through to trial. If it's after trial, I think certainly we'd be asking for something substantially higher. If she resolved her case short of trial, something a little lower than that. It's tough to tell at this point.\"\n\nLoughlin has pleaded not guilty to fraud and money laundering charges and is preparing for trial.\n\nFrom March: Olivia Jade, sister Isabella Giannulli are still enrolled at USC, college confirms\n\nMore: Olivia Jade's former classmate describes 'super-elite' school with 'insane' expectations\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, Bryan Alexander, Charles Trepany\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/21/college-admissions-scandal-lori-loughlins-daughters-have-left-usc/4059121002/", "description": "Olivia Jade and Isabella Gianulli, Lori Loughlin's daughters, have left USC in the wake of the college admissions scandal.", "authors": ["Carly Mallenbaum", "Published P.M.
