They say they plan to go ahead with the race as scheduled on Sunday afternoon with qualifying held earlier that day.\n\nBottas had a lap of 1 minute, 28.731 seconds at the 5.807-kilometer (3.608-mile) Suzuka circuit, 0.076 seconds ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton who holds a 73-point lead over Bottas in the drivers' standings with five races left.\n\nFerrari driver Sebastian Vettel was third-fastest followed by teammate Charles Leclerc.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis is expected to hit western and eastern Japan between Saturday and Sunday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It has urged people to take precautions with the storm approaching.\n\nQualifying will move to Sunday morning, when the weather is set to have cleared, with the race taking place at 2 p.m. local time, as planned. Saturday's third practice session will not be rescheduled.\n\nThe decision means the teams and drivers will have just two practice sessions, both on Friday.\n\nWhile qualifying is scheduled for Sunday, race stewards reserve the right to use the classification from the second practice on Friday for Sunday's grid positions.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
