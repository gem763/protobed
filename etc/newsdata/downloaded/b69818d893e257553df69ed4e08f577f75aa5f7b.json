For the latest, head straight to our live blog. The arithmetic looks daunting for the PM after the Democratic Unionists (DUP) insisted they could not support the government\u2019s position. \u201cI want to stress that this is a great deal for our country, for the UK; I also believe that it is a very good deal for our friends in the EU,\u201d Johnson said at the European council in Brussels where EU leaders gave the nod.\n\nPlay Video 1:10 Boris Johnson confident parliament will back his new Brexit deal \u2013 video\n\nJohnson\u2019s deal differs principally from Theresa May\u2019s by swapping the Irish border \u201cbackstop\u201d for a four-year customs alignment between Northern Ireland and the EU. Northern Ireland would be legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. A complex mechanism would allow the Stormont power-sharing assembly to vote after four years to extend or end the alignment. Without the DUP\u2019s 10 MPs, Johnson is likely to need the support of some Labour MPs and the 21 Tory rebels he expelled from the parliamentary party in September. Pro-remain MPs appeared to be pulling back from trying tomorrow to attach a second referendum to the deal \u2013 fearing they do not have enough support and preferring to wait and see if the deal passes.\n\nHeather Stewart and Lisa O\u2019Carroll write that while this weekend\u2019s vote will be extremely tight, it could be a rare win-win for Johnson. \u201cIf the PM\u2019s deal is passed by MPs on Saturday, he\u2019s well on the way to getting Brexit done. If it\u2019s rejected, and he is forced into requesting an extension against his wishes, it will provide a clear, public demonstration of his claim that he wants to get on and take Britain out of the EU \u2013 and recalcitrant MPs have stopped him.\u201d\n\nCeasefire questioned \u2013 Kurdish fighters appear to have rejected demands they withdraw from Turkey\u2019s self-declared \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria during a five-day ceasefire agreed between the US vice-president, Mike Pence, and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the Turkish president. The commander of the Kurdish SDF said he had only agreed to a ceasefire in two areas of heavy fighting, while the Kurdish political leader Saleh Muslim told local television: \u201cWe will not accept the [Turkish] occupation of northern Syria.\u201d The Pence-Erdo\u011fan deal made no mention of the presence of Syrian government and Russian troops, who were invited in by the SDF to help defend against the Turkish attack and are not bound by the terms of the US-Turkish agreement. Washington appears to have sold the Kurds a completely different deal to the one with Turkey that Trump is claiming as a diplomatic coup, writes Julian Borger. In five days Erdo\u011fan is due to fly to Moscow to meet Putin. That is where the real outline of a settlement will be hammered out, analysts say.\n\nMexico chaos \u2013 Police in Mexico arrested but then had to to release a son of the drug lord \u201cEl Chapo\u201d overnight as gun battles raged in the city of Culiac\u00e1n. Masked gunmen threw up burning barricades and exchanged fire with security forces after Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez was taken into custody. Mexico\u2019s security and public protection secretary, Alfonso Durazo, confirmed the arrest but later said the backlash was so serious that in order to safeguard the citizens of Culiac\u00e1n, the authorities had decided to \u201csuspend our actions\u201d. It was later confirmed that the young Guzm\u00e1n was let go.\n\nDNA tests miss cancer risk \u2013 DIY genetic tests being marketed direct to consumers that claim to predict the likelihood of cancer are \u201cwoefully incomplete\u201d and can falsely reassure people they have received the all-clear when they actually have a heightened risk, experts have warned. The direct-to-consumer tests give negative results to the vast majority of those carrying DNA mutations in the genes under investigation, a study by a clinical genetic testing company found. The US study analysed the DNA of 270,806 patients who were referred by healthcare providers for testing of the MUTYH gene, and 119,328 who had been referred for BRCA1/2 genetic testing. It showed that for both tests, the majority of those carrying mutations would not be spotted.\n\nMenopause support \u2013 Channel 4 is launching a menopause policy for staff that includes giving women access to flexible working arrangements and private, cool and quiet workspaces if they feel unwell. The policy will support employees experiencing symptoms such as hot flushes, anxiety and fatigue. They will also be offered an assessment of their working environment, support and guidance, while the broadcaster\u2019s leadership and HR teams have been given special training in how to support staff. The broadcaster announced its dedicated action on World Menopause Day. According to research, 59% of women in the workplace who experience menopausal symptoms say they have a negative impact on their work.\n\nMoony McMoonface? \u2013 The UK\u2019s first moon rover is due to touch down in 2021, courtesy of a private company called Spacebit. The four-legged \u201crobot spider\u201d is a cube 10cm across and weighs 1.5kg. It will be transported to the moon by the Astrobotic Peregrine lander, which was awarded $79.5m (\u00a362.3m) by Nasa in May as part of its commercial lunar payload services programme.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The SpaceBit rover, designed to be the UK\u2019s first lunar payload to reach the surface. Photograph: SpaceBit\n\nThe lander will be carrying up to 14 Nasa payloads and an equal number from private companies, including Spacebit, and other countries. The rover will test the use of legs to scuttle across the moon\u2019s uneven surface, which could lead to larger versions able to crawl into hollow lava tubes and explore the lunar subsurface.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Naming and shaming polluters\n\nGlobal environment editor Jonathan Watts discusses the Guardian\u2019s investigation into the fossil fuel industry and the structures that need to change to halt the climate emergency.

We can\u2019t afford to go back to the bad old days. We won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pictures of the Queen on the Shankill Road, west Belfast. Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Guardian\n\n\u201cThere seems little appetite for mass unruly protest,\u201d Carroll writes. \u201cUnionism is divided over Brexit: 47% of pro-union voters voted remain in the 2016 referendum. And there is a collective weariness, a desire to move on.\u201d Shoppers interviewed on Belfast\u2019s Shankill Road, where murals commemorate the Queen and loyalist paramilitaries, said they disapproved of a sea border but did not plan to mount any barricades. \u201cYou\u2019re not necessarily that happy with it but you want something that works for everyone,\u201d said one woman. Peter Shirlow, unionism expert at the University of Liverpool, said: \u201cA lorry sitting in Larne having its contents checked won\u2019t drive them back to violence. The narrative is changing. Northern Ireland is not as dysfunctional as you think.\u201d\n\nSport\n\nEddie Jones has urged England to channel the samurai spirit for their Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Australia on Saturday after springing a huge surprise by dropping George Ford and restoring the out-of-sorts Owen Farrell to fly-half. Jones\u2019s opposite number, Michael Cheika, has selected 19-year-old Jordan Petaia at outside-centre \u2013 the youngest player to start there in a World Cup \u2013 but says he trusts him \u201cinfinitely\u201d.\n\nEd Woodward believes the perception he and other non-experts are making decisions over football policy at Manchester United is \u201cinsulting\u201d, though the executive vice-chairman admits recruitment strategy was dysfunctional in the wake of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement. England\u2019s spinners will be able to draw on local knowledge in New Zealand after Jeetan Patel, the former international who captains Warwickshire, was hired on a short-term coaching deal. In an interview with the Guardian, Sean and Matty Longstaff, Newcastle\u2019s midfield brothers, have discussed their different paths to the first team, Matty\u2019s debut goal against Manchester United and why their family could rival the Nevilles. The former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has been found not guilty of sexually assaulting a woman he kissed without consent on a train. And the Lawn Tennis Association faces questions over abuse reform after Martin Corrie, its former president who resigned last month, was nominated for prestigious re\u2011election to the board of the International Tennis Federation.\n\nBusiness\n\nChina\u2019s economic growth slowed more than expected to 6.0% year on year in the third quarter, the weakest pace in more than 27 years, as demand at home and abroad faltered amid a bruising Sino-US trade war. Japanese shares inched higher after high-tech companies jumped on upbeat earnings from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC). The pound traded near a five-month high against the dollar and the euro after the Brexit deal between Boris Johnson and the EU. Sterling is worth around $1.285 and \u20ac1.155 at the moment while the FTSE is lower prior to the open.\n\nThe papers\n\nWe have a separate, full roundup of the papers today \u2013 our usual summary follows.\n\nJohnson\u2019s progress in getting his deal features on the front pages today, though most papers make it clear that this is not a done deal. The Times says: \u201cFinal hurdle in sight as Johnson gets his deal\u201d, while the Guardian reports: \u201cJohnson gets his Brexit deal \u2013 now it\u2019s a numbers game\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Guardian front page, Friday 18 October 2019. Photograph: Guardian\n\nThe Mirror says: \u201cOn the brink of Brexit \u2026 once again\u201d, the i has: \u201cJohnson gets his EU deal \u2013 now for the tricky part\u201d and the FT says \u201cDUP veto threat leaves Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal gamble in the balance\u201d.\n\nOther papers are sounding warnings to MPs to vote for the deal. The Telegraph quotes from the prime minister: \u201cIt\u2019s my deal or no deal\u201d, the Daily Mail features a picture of Johnson pointing, with the headline: \u201cHe\u2019s done his duty. Now MPs must do theirs\u201d, the Sun strikes a rhyme: \u201cGet real \u2026 take the deal\u201d and the Express says: \u201cJust do it!\u201d\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
