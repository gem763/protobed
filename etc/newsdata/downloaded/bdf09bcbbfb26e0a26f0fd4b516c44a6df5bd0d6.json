Then he got burned by Ukraine.", "language": "en", "text": "Mike Pompeo might have flown too close to Donald Trump.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, the secretary of State was widely being described as the most powerful person in the president\u2019s Cabinet \u2014 a strong, ambitious figure who has survived even as other top officials, most notably national security adviser John Bolton, have either quit or been pushed out.\n\nBut his ascent has come with a cost: Pompeo is now at the center of the Ukraine-related impeachment storm consuming Trump. Democrats accuse him of witness intimidation, diplomats feel as if he\u2019s betrayed them, and investigators are wondering if he\u2019s misled them.\n\nOn Wednesday, a top Senate Democrat demanded that Pompeo recuse himself from all Ukraine-related matters and questioned whether he was complicit in spreading misinformation about his own staff.\n\nIt\u2019s a rapid turn of events for a politician whose rise from businessman to Kansas congressman to two of the most coveted Cabinet posts in government was stunningly swift. Pompeo, too has been unusually adept at weathering Trump-related scandals, and has deliberately stoked press interest in his future political ambitions.\n\nAnd so far, Pompeo appears intent on sticking to the strategy he adopted from Day One: Defend the president and downplay any differences you may have with him, even if it undermines your own department.\n\n\u201cPompeo is seen as a Trump enabler, not a State Department protector,\u201d said Adam Ereli, a former career foreign service officer who served as ambassador to Bahrain. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to most people that Pompeo cares most about Pompeo.\u201d\n\nThe secretary of State this week confirmed that he had listened in on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president that is now fueling Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe admission came after days of Pompeo dodging questions about his exact role in ways that implied he was not aware of the contents of the call.\n\nPompeo defended the substance of the conversation but sidestepped the key concern: that Trump demanded Ukraine investigate one of his 2020 political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe call \u201cwas about helping the Ukrainians to get graft out and corruption outside of their government,\u201d Pompeo said while in Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s what the State Department officials that I\u2019ve had the privilege to lead have been engaged in, and it\u2019s what we will continue to do, even while all this noise is going on.\u201d\n\nPompeo\u2019s handling of the Ukraine controversy is made more complicated by the role of Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, who has repeatedly insisted that the State Department, including the secretary, was aware of his activities and even had requested them.\n\nAway from the cameras, Pompeo has gone beyond casual dismissals of the \u201cnoise.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, he sent a letter to House committees slamming their effort to obtain testimonies from State Department officials linked to the Ukraine controversy. Pompeo even published the letter on his Twitter feed.\n\nHe couched his letter as a defense of civil and foreign service officers who work for the State Department, accusing lawmakers of trying to bully them into fast depositions. But lawmakers, as well as many U.S. diplomats, saw it another way: as Pompeo trying to scare his staff into silence.\n\nThree Democratic House committee chairmen on Tuesday took the unusual step of sending a response not to Pompeo, but to his deputy, John Sullivan.\n\nThey warned that his boss could face criminal penalties if he tried to impede the impeachment investigation. They also wrote that because Pompeo listened in on the July 25 call, he has a conflict of interest and could be \u201ca fact witness in the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, went further, demanding that Pompeo recuse himself from all Ukraine-related matters, including those affecting the impeachment inquiry, as well as regular foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThe American people need to have confidence that the nation\u2019s chief diplomat is making decisions based on the national interest \u2014 not to advance a partisan political agenda,\u201d Menendez wrote. \u201cRecusal is the only option at this point to prevent further erosion of the integrity of U.S. foreign policy.\u201d\n\nLater Wednesday, Menendez questioned whether Pompeo may have spread misinformation within the State Department about his own employees who have been caught up in the impeachment inquiry. Menendez\u2019s comments came after the department\u2019s inspector general, in a hastily scheduled briefing, gave Congress documents tarring those employees that had come into his possession.", "description": "Mike Pompeo might have flown too close to Donald Trump.
