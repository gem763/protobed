In Game 2, he had his first RBI this postseason, a tiebreaking solo homer off Houston Astros ace Justin Verlander to spark a bat-around seventh inning.\n\nThe Nationals went on to a 12-3 win Wednesday night to take a 2-0 lead before even playing their first World Series game at Nationals Park. Game 3 is there Friday night.\n\nSuzuki\u2019s body has been battered by run-saving blocks on pitches in the dirt, the kind that got the appreciation of Nationals starter Max Scherzer after they won Game 1 of the World Series.\n\n\u201cI was having to make pitches out of the stretch from the first inning on. I just stayed with (Suzuki),\u201d Scherzer said after throwing five innings. \u201cHe called some big-time pitches for me and blocked some big-time pitches too, especially with runners on third base.\u201d\n\nWith so much mental effort put into game-planning with his own pitchers, the offensive side of the game can suffer. Suzuki went into Game 2 of the World Series hitting only .043 (1 for 23) this postseason.\n\nOf course, he also scored the tiebreaking run in Washington\u2019s 5-4 win in Game 1. He drew a leadoff walk in the fifth and later ran home on Adam Eaton\u2019s single that made it 3-2 and put the Nationals ahead to stay.\n\nThe catcher missed Game 1 of the NL Championship Series after a scary moment in Game 5 of the NL Division Series, when Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Walker Buehler hit him on the left wrist with a 94 mph fastball and the ball shot up and knocked off his helmet as the ballpark went silent.\n\nAfter falling to the ground and grabbing his face, Suzuki walked off his under his own power. He was back behind the plate three days later.\n\nJust part of the grind.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kurt Suzuki is beat up physically, with a sore back and other ailments after grinding behind the plate from spring training through late October.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Hawkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/world_series_nationals_astros_baseball_18872_c0-138-3291-2057_s1200x700.jpg?6718c25acee44d43510a3439195b71c61dc21d43", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
