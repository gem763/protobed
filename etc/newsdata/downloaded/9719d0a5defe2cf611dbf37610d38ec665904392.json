You're not doing this, it's not going to happen.'\n\nRose locked all the doors and pulled all the blinds down in her home and refused to leave for days following the alleged assault.\n\nTo the mother's horror, John returned to her home months later and began calling her name and knocking for five minutes, while he was allegedly intoxicated.\n\nShe immediately called police saying the man who allegedly raped her was outside her home.\n\nJohn has been charged with sexual intercourse without consent but intends not to plead guilty, a court has heard. He was granted bail.\n\nBut Rose said John had begun using another dating app, which allows him to do so because his bail conditions don't ban him from using social media.\n\nJohn, which turned out not to be his real name, turned up to Rose's home in Sydney's north uninvited several times, after her children had left and she was alone (stock image)\n\nThree women told police they had been raped after agreeing to meet up with someone they had met off dating app Bumble.\n\nOne rape occurred in a Sydney hostel room, while another occurred at one in Byron Bay.\n\nA woman was driven home and raped after having drinks with her date at a Surry Hills bar.", "description": "NSW police have confirmed one in five sexual assaults occurred within Sydney's party spots after an arrangement to meet through a dating app.", "authors": ["Paula Ahillon For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/03/19350282-0-image-a-2_1570329254672.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
