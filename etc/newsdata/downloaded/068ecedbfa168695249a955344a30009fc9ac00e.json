But beneath that veneer was trouble, for that area had voted completely Liberal the last election. Trudeau\u2019s party should have been utterly dominating, instead of merely leading.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnd now that the results are in, even though the outlook may seem better \u2014 Trudeau, after all, remains prime minister \u2014 it\u2019s actually a lot worse. And that is a statement to be made not just for the Liberals, but also Canada\u2019s reputation for progressiveness.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Liberal party ended the night at 157 seats out of 338 electoral districts, shy of the 170 majority needed to form the government. But the leader of the fourth-place New Democratic Party (NDP) \u2014 traditionally to the left of the left-leaning Liberals \u2014 has already said he will back a Trudeau government.\n\nThat means Trudeau keeps his job, but with an even more progressive kingmaker holding his leash. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, a 40-year-old turban-wearing ethnic minority known for speaking in colloquialisms and Canadian slang \u2014 more \u201cbrand Trudeau\u201d than Trudeau himself \u2014 will hold strong power. In a Westminster-style political system like Canada\u2019s, that\u2019s called a minority government.\n\nWith Singh\u2019s support, there is an image of sameness, the continuation of the Canadian reputation the world has known through Trudeau: a sort of bastion of moral leadership, built on the prime minister\u2019s idealistic vision for doing politics differently, empowering the traditionally repressed and greater participation on the world stage, distilled into a famous \u201cCanada is back\u201d victory speech in 2015.\n\nBut on Monday \u2014 insofar as in the context of Trudeau\u2019s 2015 speech \u2014 Canada was gone.\n\nThere will likely be no greater international participation, no dogged pursuit of the United Nations Security Council seat Trudeau had vowed. Running a minority government is a tough job, for you have to devote a lot of energy to politicking and remaining in power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to engage internationally when your focus is on being in the House of Commons to make sure you win the next vote,\u201d the former politician Allan Rock told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp today. \u201cI was in New York as the ambassador to the UN when there was a minority government in Ottawa. Can\u2019t tell you the number of times ministers had to cancel visits or speeches.\u201d\n\nAll that is not to say that minority governments are always disasters, whether in terms of staying in power or getting things done. In the 1960s, a Liberal minority government \u2014 again backed by the NDP \u2014 pushed through universal healthcare. Trudeau\u2019s Conservative predecessor Stephen Harper held minority governments together through sheer force of will for five years.\n\nBut recall Harper\u2019s second minority government faced such instability he had to suspend parliament to avoid being voted out, a matter memorably described by Maclean\u2019s magazine as \u201ca crisis that shook the nation.\u201d\n\nPower in Canada\u2019s political system is like the Iron Throne from Game of Thrones, built from blades that are still sharp. No one ever sits comfortably in the big chair. Often dubbed the \u201cfirst among equals,\u201d the prime minister is just one of the 338 legislators who happens to lead the most powerful party.\n\nAny Liberal can challenge Trudeau for his post. Threats and signs of instability come from both inside and out. And that gets worse with minority governments, when weakness is smelled everywhere and sensed quickly.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Among insiders, there is already talk of replacing the current Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, who led the party to great gains, winning the popular vote but falling short of attaining anything tangible.\n\nDespite playing kingmaker, the New Democrats, led by Singh, had actually fallen hard \u2014 down 15 seats \u2014 another indication that the power Trudeau-esque progressive politics holds is waning.
