(AP) - From a young age, Alex Jamieson was the one always there to lend a caring ear to those who needed to talk, but tragically at 22, Jamieson, who had long battled depression, died by suicide earlier this year.\n\nEven though his life was short, Alex Jamieson\u2019s legacy is destined to be a force in helping others through the Alexander Jordan Jamieson Foundation, begun by his older brother, Jamie Jamieson.\n\nOn Saturday, the Milford Skate Park, a place Jamieson loved and frequented to make himself happier, was renamed The Alexander Jordan Jamieson Memorial Skate Park, and a lively festival full of live bands - he was also a musician - was held. The day included material on suicide awareness education, food trucks, foundation merchandise and most importantly, the event aimed to \u201cstart a conversation in town about depression,\u201d organizers said.\n\nAlex Jamieson was open about his battle with depression and was being treated, but still, the handsome young man - talented guitar player and adored by all - lost the struggle this spring.\n\nJamie Jamieson, a fire department captain at Electric Boat in Groton, started the foundation a few weeks after his brother\u2019s death and he said the support from the community has been phenomenal.\n\nJamie Jamieson said he went into fast action following his little brother\u2019s death after reading an Instagram post by Alex about he wanted to help people battling depression.\n\nAlex\u2019s work helping others will live on through the foundation.\n\nAlex\u2019s mother, Debbie Jamieson, said about 800 people were at Alex\u2019s wake and the common refrain was they didn\u2019t how they would get the through the tragedy without Alex, because he\u2019s the one they always turned to in troubled times such as those.\n\nAside from education around suicide, the central objective of the foundation is a scholarship for a musical instrument and lessons for a child fighting depression. It\u2019s starting local and Jamie Jamieson hopes to take it \u201cNational as quick as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was very loving - he\u2019s the kid who would walk up to a stranger and say, \u2018Hi,\u2019 \u201d Jamie Jamieson said. As a 12-year-old, Alex once wore a sign that said, \u201cHugs for Free,\u201d his brother recalled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already heard people say we\u2019ve reached people,\u201d positively in opening the conversation about suicide, Jamie Jamieson said, and that is the overarching goal.\n\n\u201cPeople think they\u2019re alone fighting depression. They don\u2019t know how many people are battling depression,\u201d he said. He said the stigma around suicide shouldn\u2019t exist either.\n\nDebbie Jamieson, said her son was funny, always in motion, and \u201cHe loved being there for other people.\u201d She said the outpouring Saturday was touching and she hopes headway will made in removing the stigma around suicide.\n\nAlex Jamieson\u2019s close friend, Jimmy Barbetti, 26, said his friend was, \u201ca real chill dude,\u201d outgoing and a \u201cpeople person.\u201d\n\nBarbetti said the skate park was Alex\u2019s happy place and they skated there nearly every day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome we renamed the park in his honor,\u201d Barbetti said.\n\nThe Milford Parks and Recreation Commission voted unanimously to rename the skate park, as a result of a Change.Org petition one of his friends started that quickly grew to 3,000 plus signatures.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2nQbgFi\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Connecticut Post, http://www.connpost.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "From a young age, Alex Jamieson was the one always there to lend a caring ear to those who needed to talk, but tragically at 22, Jamieson, who had long battled depression, died by suicide earlier this year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pam Mclouglin"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
