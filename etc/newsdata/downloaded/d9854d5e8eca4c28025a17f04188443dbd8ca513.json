(Reuters) - The staggering decline of honey bee colonies has alarmed experts across the United States, but an unconventional apiculturist in California thinks he has found a way to save them.\n\nMichael Thiele has championed an approach he calls the \u201crewilding\u201d of honeybees, allowing them to live as they did for millions of years \u2014 in natural log hives high above the ground.\n\n\u201cWe can do this very, very simple thing \u2014 return bees into their natural nest environment, into their natural biosphere,\u201d said German-born Thiele at his home in Sebastopol, California. \u201cIf we lose them due to human-induced mass extinction, will there be a tomorrow?\u201d\n\nThiele\u2019s method consists of hollowing out logs and strapping them high on tree trunks to mimic bees\u2019 hives before they were domesticated. He also sometimes suspends them from barn rafters or perches them high on wooden tables for a similar effect.\n\nHoney bees are critical to the planet\u2019s ecosystem because they pollinate plants that produce about a quarter of the food consumed by Americans, according to U.S. government reports.\n\nLast winter, U.S. beekeepers lost almost 40% of their colonies, according to a report this year by the Bee Informed Partnership, a group of industry participants.\n\nIt was the worst winter die-off in more than a decade.\n\nWild bee populations are declining too, but researchers found in 2015 that wild bees from around Ithaca, New York recovered from the introduction of the deadly \u201cvarroa mite\u201d in the 1990s while domesticated bees did not.\n\nBee preservationist Michael J. Thiele, 54, holds a bee near a nest habitat in Sebastopol, California, September 6, 2019. Thiele estimates that he has \"midwifed\" billions of bees by building traditional nest habitats that attract bees from within the local watershed through swarming, which increases the bee population exponentially. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nThiele also says domesticated bees are more vulnerable because they are raised using smoke and chemicals and fed sugar water, which he claims is bad for their health.\n\nBARE-HANDED BEEKEEPER\n\nHabitat loss, along with heavy pesticide use, climate change and increasing urbanization are the main causes for declining bee populations, experts say here\n\nThiele said his life with bees began with vivid dreams about them about 20 years ago when he was living in Big Sur in northern California. \u201cAnd they were so intense that, you know how it is after a very strong dream, you wake up and it stays with you.\u201d\n\nSo he borrowed an empty box from a local beekeeper and soon it was swarming with bees, drawn by the old smell of bees in the box.\n\nThiele over time rejected the \u201crectangular white boxes\u201d of traditional beekeeping and refused to use chemicals, smoke or protective clothing when interacting with bees, scooping them up from their hives bare-handed.\n\n\u201cIt feels so intimate and I feel how deeply we belong and how important it is to protect them,\u201d he said as a swarm of bees crawled over his hand and arm.\n\nOnce a hollowed-out log hive is attached to a tree, it becomes attractive to bee \u201cscouts\u201d looking for a nest site, who then alert their bee colonies to move into it.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nHe\u2019s been making the log hives since 2008 and says they are sometimes colonized within days and usually within a few weeks.\n\nThiele does not consider himself a beekeeper in the conventional sense. He created his Apis Arborea firm (Latin for bees in trees) solely to rewild honeybees and said he does not farm the honey the bees produce unless the colony leaves the hive or dies. His hives, he said, are both a conservation project and a personal mission.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if honey bees make the fragility of life so palpable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as if they are really mirroring where we are on this time on this planet.\u201d", "description": "The staggering decline of honey bee colonies has alarmed experts across the United States, but an unconventional apiculturist in California thinks he has found a way to save them.", "authors": ["Jane Ross", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444496701&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0WP", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
