(angela n./Flickr)\n\nTODAY\u2019S DAILY DIGIT\n\n9/10: Ignoring some clouds because mid-60s to near 70 is awfully pleasant. Perfect for the first home game of the World Series. #StayInTheFight #WinTheFight\n\nEXPRESS FORECAST\n\nToday: Variable cloud cover. Highs: Mid-60s to near 70.\n\nTonight: Mostly cloudy, calm. Lows: Upper 40s to mid-50s.\n\nSaturday: Increasing clouds. Afternoon shower? Highs: 60s.\n\nSunday: Chance of rain, mainly in the morning. Highs: Low to mid-70s.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post headquarters.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nClouds may try to claim a lot of sky time until Monday. Shower chances start tomorrow, and we could see some (probably not major) impact on the World Series and Marine Corps Marathon this weekend, although the former seems it may end up with few rain troubles. We\u2019ll keep updating our forecast as we go through the pivotal weekend.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device.

Clouds are perhaps the most challenging part of the day\u2019s forecast, with differing data on just when clouds may increase. Should we unexpectedly see more sun last through the day, with few clouds, we could see 70 degrees in a few spots. However, with more clouds than sun, mid- to upper 60s are more likely. A light southerly breeze around 5 mph arrives midday. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: If not fully during the evening, clouds confidently take over into the night. World Series Game 3 looks good, though! Breezes die down and remain fairly light and variable, if any. Temperatures don\u2019t fall too much, into the upper 40s to perhaps as warm as mid-50s (downtown) near sunrise. Confidence: High\n\nFollow us on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Gridlock. Keep reading for the forecast into next week.\n\nTomorrow (Saturday): A few morning peeks of sun seem possible, otherwise clouds win. A couple showers are possible midafternoon into sunset. Highest chance for getting wet? West of town. We could stay dry entirely, as well. High temperatures range across the 60s, with a few upper 60s to near 70 possible in drier scenarios. A light but steady easterly breeze builds into the afternoon. Confidence: Medium\n\nTomorrow night: Any evening showers should be quick and not too heavy. World Series Game 4 dampening would be brief (if any). Nearer dawn, the next round of showers could move in. But we could see some stars and moon action in between these rain chances. We may actually warm from evening temperatures around 60 degrees toward mid-60s near dawn. A moderate southeastern wind is helping to warm and moisten the air (it may feel muggy near sunrise). Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nSunday: Showers arrive in a more widespread fashion, and even a couple of periods of steadier rain are possible. You\u2019ll probably want some rain gear if you\u2019re watching the Marine Corps Marathon, as showers are most likely in the morning through midafternoon time frame. Oh, and mugginess arrives in full (dew points in the 60s) thanks to noticeable southerly breezes near 15 mph. We should attain the low to mid-70s by late afternoon. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\nSunday night: A few showers may linger into mid-evening, but the vast majority of the nighttime hours look dry and almost clear, as it stands now. If we have a fifth game of the World Series, it shouldn\u2019t have a major weather problem as it appears now. Lows range through the 50s by dawn. A northwesterly breeze may make it feel a bit cooler. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\nSunny, pleasant 60s to around 70 starts our workweek on Monday and Tuesday. The air feels fairly neutral for this time of year (dew points in the 50s), meaning it\u2019s neither muggy nor too dry (needing moisturizer). We\u2019ll watch as we get closer to make sure this great couple of days stays on track. Cloud levels and temperatures could veer a little up or down. Stay tuned.
