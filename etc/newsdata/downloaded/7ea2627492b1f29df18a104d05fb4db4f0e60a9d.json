Sanders is running third behind Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nBattling to catch up in the polls with Warren, the Sanders campaign is hoping for a boost from these shows of support.\n\nSanders has tried to woo younger and more racially diverse supporters, winning the endorsement of the rap artist Cardi B, who is from the Bronx, another New York borough that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s congressional district partially comprises.\n\nThe first round of voting will take place February, in Iowa.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Firebrand Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on Saturday at the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/b4cc94_representative-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-endorsed-uncle-bernie-sanders-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
