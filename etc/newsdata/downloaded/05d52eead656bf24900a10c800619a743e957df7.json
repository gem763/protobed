Billy Vunipola went high, and Christian Lealiifano kicked Australia in front.\n\nBut England did not panic and after Anthony Watson made ground down the right, the ball tracked left, Manu Tuilagi ran a decoy and Tom Curry put May in for his first try. Before the Aussies could make sense of what had happened, May struck again.\n\nThis time it came from a fumble in the English 22, Slade picked up and bolted into open space. Closed down by defenders he kept his head, saw May level with him on the left and slipped a pin-point kick through the golden defensive line for May to run onto.\n\nFarrell\u2019s place had been called into question following a sub-par display against Argentina, particularly with the boot.\n\n(Image: Getty Images,)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nHow typical of the England captain that he should respond with 11 tackles and three perfect shots at goal to see his side into half-time leading 17-9.\n\nAs the players left the field Wonderwall rang out around the stadium as fin homage to the 2003 final, when England beat Australia and their players celebrated by belting out the Oasis classic.\n\nBut it was Australia who had most to get excited about moments lateral the game restarted and an Elliot Daly defensive horror show let them back into the game.\n\nFirst the fullback fumbled a reception then, as Australia went left, with Reece Hodge throwing a divine pass out to Petaia, who slipped it expertly inside to Marika Koroibete, Daly showed the Fijian-born wing the outside and he emphatically took it.\n\n(Image: AFLO/Press Association Images)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLealiifano\u2019s conversion made it a one-point ball game but before Red Rose nerves could show themselves they were back in the box seat, Farrell picking out Sinckler with a sublime pass to put the prop over.\n\nThat was not quite that as England had to put in an incredible defensive set on their own line to repel one last Wallaby onslaught, before Sinckler turned the ball over.\n\nFrom there the dye was cast. Farrell completed a perfect day with the boot to take the game away from the Wallabies, before Watson completed the rout with a late interception try.\n\n(Image: Getty Images,)\n\nEngland\n\nTries: May 2, Sinckler, Watson.\n\nCons: Farrell 4.\n\nPens: Farrell 4.\n\nAustralia\n\nTry: Koroibete.\n\nCon: Lealiifano.\n\nPens: Lealiifano 3.", "description": "Anthony Watson and Kyle Sinckler also went over as England reached the semi-finals in Japan", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Reuters", "Aflo Press Association Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652596.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RUGBYU-WC-2019-MATCH41-ENG-AUS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
