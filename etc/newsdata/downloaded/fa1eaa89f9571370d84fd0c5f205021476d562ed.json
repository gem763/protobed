Please help us by supporting our independent journalism\n\nWales are approaching the stage where their next match could be Warren Gatland\u2019s last in charge. He has at least three left, starting on Wednesday with Fiji at Oita Stadium, the venue for the quarter-final for which they appear destined, but is not minded to settle for less than five.\n\nWales have not been seen as potential finalists at this stage of a World Cup before, not even 1987 when they blundered into the semi-finals after playing minnows and mediocre European opposition on the way and were duly flattened by New Zealand. Now, set on a course where they would meet the All Blacks only if they made the final, there is a quiet but deep confidence in a side that all too often in past tournaments has lacked self-belief and found different ways to implode.\n\nEngland poised to leave out Billy Vunipola for France World Cup match Read more\n\nGatland, who is leaving next month after nearly 12 years as head coach, has been planning for this World Cup since they were knocked out by South Africa in the 2015 quarter-final after conceding a late try. That they came so close, despite being ravaged by injuries, said everything about the character he had developed in the squad but he has since supplemented that with greater nous.\n\nConditioning has never been an issue under Gatland. Composure in the final quarter of a tight match, when bodies are tired and battered and minds can drift, has been \u2013 but it was Wales who had the finishing power in their previous match against Australia that allowed them to hang on for their first victory over one of the southern hemisphere\u2019s big three in a group match.\n\nGatland was appointed because Wales lost against Fiji in the 2007 World Cup and, instead of going to Marseilles to face South Africa in the quarter-final, found themselves heading home with their head coach Gareth Jenkins already fired. One of his low points came in 2010 when Wales drew at home against Fiji and in between the final whistle and his post-match media conference stripped Ryan Jones of the captaincy, a rare moment when his control looked uncertain: the next five months were taxing, but less than a year later they were one kick away from making the World Cup final.\n\nWales have not looked back. While New Zealand, England and South Africa are the more fancied to win the World Cup, Wales look set for a quarter-final against France if they defeat Fiji and then Uruguay on Sunday, a team that nobody will fancy taking on because it has no discernible vulnerable points. What has been significant for Gatland so far is that with the exception of the second-row Cory Hill returning home, he has no injury concerns.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nAsked who he fancied in the quarter-final, Gatland replied: \u201cWe are concentrating on our next two games. We know we are in control of our own destiny and there are benefits to winning the group in terms of turnaround time and the choice of hotels. And, psychologically, if you win all your matches and the group, you are up against a team that has lost once. The players are aware of the possibilities, but at the moment we have to focus 100% on Fiji and then Uruguay, who will be challenging.\u201d\n\nWales have made two fast starts this tournament. They led Georgia 29-0 at the break and were 23-8 up on Australia. They did not win either of the second halves, but the All Blacks have long been into energy conservation in tournaments. Wales have a single\u2011mindedness of a side that is not reliant on chance or their opponents having an off day.\n\nAre England or France happy to lose Pool C decider to avoid the All Blacks? | Robert Kitson Read more\n\n\u201cWales will want to finish top of the pool and avoid England in the quarter-finals,\u201d said the Fiji head coach, John McKee. \u201cThere is a lot at stake for them but we know they are a good side, the Six Nations champions, who are playing a bit more expansively here, dangerous in attack but strong in defence.\u201d\n\nGatland wants another bold start to dampen the early exuberance with which Fiji normally play. \u201cThe more they feel they are getting something out of a game, the more dangerous they are,\u201d he said. In times past, not least 2007, Wales could be derailed by the likes of Fiji and Samoa, drawn into a loose, anarchic game which was played on their opponents\u2019 terms.\n\nThey have one of the most exciting players this tournament in the scrum\u2011half Gareth Davies, a blur of motion and activity, but what marks them out now is that they recognise there is a time and a place to go for it. After their Cheika-mate against Australia, it is hard to see them being drawn into a game of draughts by the flamboyant Fijians.", "description": "Wales are approaching the stage where their next match could be Warren Gatland\u2019s last in charge.
