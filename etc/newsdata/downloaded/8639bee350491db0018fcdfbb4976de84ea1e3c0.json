Video shared on Twitter showed people walking out of the meeting.\n\nPeople then targeted cars and buildings, which were set alight, Johannesburg Metro Police Department chief David Tembe told Eyewitness News, saying it was \"pure criminality\" as some of the shops attacked belonged to South Africans.\n\nEarlier, dozens of men carrying clubs marched in the city singing \"foreigners must go back to where they came from\", Soweten Live reported. The crowd headed to Jules Park in Johannesburg where Mr Buthelezi was due to make his address.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa condemned the violence, saying the authorities would \"not allow sporadic lawlessness and violence to disrupt the safety and livelihoods of millions of South Africans\".\n\nHe added that \"the majority of foreign nationals in our country... are law-abiding and have the right to conduct their lives and businesses in peace\".\n\nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari sent an envoy to South Africa last week to \"express Nigeria's displeasure over the treatment of her citizens\".\n\nIn a statement, the president's office said the envoy had \"stressed the need for [the] South African government to take visible measures to stop violence against citizens of brotherly African nations\".\n\nPresident Ramaphosa \"agreed that the violence was most disconcerting and embarrassing,\" the statement added.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Fake videos stoke tension amid South Africa xenophobic attacks\n\nLast week, police said that they had arrested more than 420 people and the unrest had subsided.
