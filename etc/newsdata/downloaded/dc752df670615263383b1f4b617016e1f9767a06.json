Smallzy? Fitzy & Wippa? Channel 10? What, and I can\u2019t express this enough, the shit? Following last night\u2019s finale, brand new Bachie couple Matt Agnew and Chelsie McLeod and runner-up Abbie Chatfield set out on their obligatory press tour. And somehow all three of them ended up just metres away from each other, in opposite studios at Nova HQ. And apparently, it was just an accident. Yeah, cool. Funny.\n\nNova host Smallzy posted a video of the \u201caccidental encounter\u201d on Twitter, captioning it: \u201cSometimes awkward run-ins happen.\u201d\n\nAnd look, you can piss right off with that. A lot of planning goes into press tours \u2013 things like this don\u2019t just \u201caccidentally\u201d happen. And even if it was an accident, both stations were more than happy to turn its interview into an \u2018Oh, my God, turn around and look who\u2019s in the other booth. HahHAhahhh, how awkward!\u2019\n\nDespite insisting that she was fine, Abbie was obviously not \u2013 you can see it on her face. Who the fuck enjoys running into their ex? No one does. NO ONE. And love Abbie or hate her, this is just awful and unnecessary.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to weird you out right now but they [Matt and Chelsie] are in that studio over there,\u201d Smallzy tells Abbie.\n\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThat is the most horrible thing I have ever experienced in my life,\u201d she adds.\n\nSometimes awkward run-ins happen ????

Kyle Sandilands decided to ask Matt and Chelsie about their sex life and then proceeded to pass those details on to \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Abbie. Get fucked, mate.
