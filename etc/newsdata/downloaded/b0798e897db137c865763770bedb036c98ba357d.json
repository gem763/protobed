But it\u2019s good to keep our eyes forward and focus on BYU.\u201d\n\nSlovis threw for 377 yards and three touchdowns in the 45-20 victory over the Cardinal. Those numbers were the best ever posted by a freshman Trojan quarterback making his first start.\n\nFive different receivers caught at least five passes against the Cardinal. Tyler Vaughns and Amon-Ra St. Brown had the biggest performances, piling up 203 yards and three touchdowns combined.\n\nTheir efforts positioned USC to chase its second 3-0 start in eight seasons.\n\n\u201c(Slovis) didn\u2019t have to be Superman,\u201d USC coach Clay Helton said. \u201cThe skill kids did. Our skill kids, I thought, played really well for him. Our offensive line blocked extremely well for him. The entire team rallied around him.\u201d\n\nBYU (1-1) saw some promising signs from its own offense late in the Cougars\u2019 29-26 double-overtime win over Tennessee. It was a step in the right direction after a flat performance against Utah a week earlier.\n\n\u201cIn all three phases, there\u2019s a lot of things we can adjust and improve on,\u201d BYU coach Kalani Sitake said. \u201cWe made some improvements from week one to week two, but I\u2019d like to see it continue.\u201d\n\nThe Cougars have struggled with stopping the run in their first two games, allowing 252 yards per game and 5.2 yards per rush. Their passing defense could get the bigger test this time around. BYU ranks 20th nationally in that category, allowing just 141.0 yards per game.\n\nKeeping USC\u2019s version of the Air Raid grounded will be the team\u2019s focus Saturday.\n\n\u201cOur mindset needs to be get to the QB as fast as we can,\u201d defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga said. \u201cPressure their freshman quarterback. That has to be a key for our defensive line. We need to crush the pocket.\u201d\n\nHere are other things to know when USC visits BYU on Saturday:\n\nSACK HAPPY\n\nGetting protection hasn\u2019t come easy for BYU QB Zach Wilson. The sophomore has been sacked five times through two games for a total loss of 21 yards. Wilson suffered four of those sacks against the Volunteers, which led to the Cougars\u2019 offense stalling on multiple drives. It is a definite concern for BYU with USC averaging 3.0 sacks per game.\n\nRETURN THREAT\n\nVelus Jones Jr. could be a game-changing threat for USC on special teams. Jones has already tallied 240 yards and a touchdown on eight kickoff returns this season. His 30.0 yards per return average ranks second in the Pac-12. He will go up against a BYU special teams unit that allows just 6.67 yards per return on opponent kickoff returns, which ranks second among FBS teams.\n\nKAFUSI OUT\n\nBYU defensive end Devin Kaufusi will sit out the first half after being ejected against Tennessee for targeting. Kaufusi has appeared in BYU\u2019s first two games, totaling a single assisted tackle.\n\nTROJAN HOMECOMING\n\nUSC defensive tackle Jay Tufele will make a return to his home state after committing to the Trojans in 2018. Tufele, who has 10 tackles and a sack in two games, went to Bingham High School in South Jordan, a 30-minute drive from Provo. He was the No. 1 recruit in Utah in the 2018 class.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of family and friends that are coming out, and I\u2019m just really excited to go back home and put on a show for them,\u201d Tufele said.\n\nWILLIAMS EXITS\n\nUSC receiver Devon Williams entered the NCAA transfer portal after seeing limited action so far this season. Williams caught one pass for 11 yards against Stanford on Saturday and did not play in the opener against Fresno State. The sophomore appeared in all 12 games for the Trojans last season, totaling 87 yards on four receptions.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Now it's time to see how the Kedon Slovis show plays on the road.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Coon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/stanford_usc_football_68432_c0-157-3291-2075_s1770x1032.jpg?f5597963b2e3aa4ae1546da8ee9df15d757b7457", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
