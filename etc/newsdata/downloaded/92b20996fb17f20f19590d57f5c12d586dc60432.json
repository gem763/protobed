Three weeks on from that blow to the neck, with the series locked at 1-1 after the heroics of Ben Stokes, the right-hander will be restored to Australia\u2019s side for the fourth Test at Old Trafford.\n\nIn adds fresh intrigue to a series that is shaping up to be a classic. Stuart Broad, while denied a reunion with Jimmy Anderson after England\u2019s record Test wicket-taker was ruled out by injury, cannot wait to see how his strike partner responds.\n\nJoe Denly confirms switch with Roy to open batting for England in Ashes Read more\n\n\u201cIt was a nasty hit, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d said Broad before England trained on Monday. \u201cFirst thing, it\u2019s great Steve is OK and coming back into Test cricket but Test cricket is a brutal sport where countries go hell for leather against each other. I\u2019m sure when Steve comes in, Jofra will be in Joe Root\u2019s ear wanting the ball, no doubt about that.\n\n\u201cIt was a really tasty bit of cricket at Lord\u2019s. Smith was on 80, playing beautifully, and Jofra went from 84mph to 95mph. He was really charging in. That sort of cricket is awesome to watch on the telly or from the stands but when you\u2019re stood at mid-on, it\u2019s pretty special. Hopefully we can have a battle like that again.\n\n\u201cThe dream is someone nicks him off first ball and Jofra doesn\u2019t get to bowl at him but he doesn\u2019t average 60-odd for nothing. There will be a period in this game where those two come together again and \u2013 touch wood \u2013 I\u2019m on the pitch to view it.\u201d\n\nSmith resumed batting against Derbyshire last week \u2013 he made 23 before holing out to the leg spin of Matt Critchley \u2013 but knows the true test awaits. The 30-year-old has been peppered by bouncers in the nets as he looks to shake off any lingering doubts.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Smith will not have \u2018any little demons\u2019 to deal with on his return said the Australia coach, Justin Langer. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images via Reuters\n\nJustin Langer said: \u201cWhen you get hit, there\u2019s always a little voice on your shoulder. I also know about Steve Smith and the really good players, you\u2019ve got to have strategies to score runs and not get out \u2013 it\u2019s the same to not get hit.\u201d\n\nThe Australia coach added: \u201cHe works the game out better than anyone I\u2019ve ever met in my life. He would\u2019ve thought long and hard about it. If anyone\u2019s going to get over any little demons, it\u2019ll be Steven.\u201d\n\nBroad returns to the ground where in 2014 his nose was broken by a bouncer from India\u2019s Varun Aaron \u2013 a before-and-after moment in his own batting career \u2013 but believes this series, played on pitches with up and down bounce, has hit a new level in terms of physical threat.\n\n\u201c[Smith] has got a bit more skill than me with the bat so it probably won\u2019t affect him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever played in a series where so many people have been hit in the head. It feels like the doctors are running out every 10 overs, doesn\u2019t it? But that\u2019s part of Test cricket. You bowl a bouncer not to hit someone in the head, you bowl a bouncer to manoeuvre footwork and change momentum of body weight. But your best bouncer is directed over leg stump and at the head, unfortunately. If it hits, fortunately the helmets have got really good. They are much better now.\u201d", "description": "Stuart Broad said Steve Smith will face more of the same from Jofra Archer when the batsman comes back from concussion at Old Trafford", "authors": ["Ali Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8211f45e93389d96944b0d0fc1dc100965755da8/0_22_4049_2429/master/4049.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=384df222f0fa1f335ff5f2cb9473b246"}
