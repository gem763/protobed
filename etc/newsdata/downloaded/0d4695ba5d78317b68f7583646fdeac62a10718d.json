The spokesman said that the two nations have close contacts both between diplomats and the military that would help them avoid such a development.\n\nHowever, Moscow has also clarified it did not approve of Turkey\u2019s plans to occupy Syrian towns as part of its operation. On Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry denied reports that Russia has no objections against a Turkish assault on the Kurdish-held city of Kobani.\n\nThe notion had previously appeared in the Turkish media, citing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as well as in Al Jazeera and Western outlets like the New York Times. But the Russian ministry said the issue of Kobani \u201cwas not discussed\u201d with Turkey, and branded the media reports \u201cfake.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Syrian Army deployed to country\u2019s northeast to counter \u2018Turkish aggression\u2019 (VIDEOS)\n\nHis words came amid the news that the Kurdish-led administration in northern Syria allegedly reached an agreement with Damascus for Syrian government troops to be deployed along the border with Turkey. The Syrian Army already moved towards the border, entering the city of Manbij in the northern province of Aleppo late on Sunday, according to some reports.\n\nOn Sunday, Turkish Defense Ministry claimed its troops already pushed 30-35km into the Kurdish-held territory \u2013 well beyond its proposed 30km \u2018safe zone.\u2019 Turkey\u2019s advances led to an exodus of Kurdish civilians from the area.\n\nThe Kurds were also reported to have abandoned the camps where Islamic State\u2019s militants were held. Such a development sparked some concerns in Moscow as President Vladimir Putin previously warned that the Turkish offensive could contribute to the resurgence of the terrorist organization.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
