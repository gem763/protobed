These things are an absolute necessity,\" said Mr Martin.\n\n\"I do not want a world where people are defecating in the street because they can't find a toilet.\"\n\nCouncils are responsible for running public toilets, but there is currently no legal duty for them to provide the facilities, and many have been shut as local authorities try to cut costs.\n\nIn Wales - where local government is devolved - more than 100 public toilets have closed in recent years.\n\nSome have since reopened, after being taken over and run by community groups including mums, grandmothers and taxi drivers, while other empty buildings have been sold and turned into cafes.\n\nWhat do they cost to run?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Public toilets are a 'basic human right', campaigners say\n\nCurrently those who run non-domestic properties - including public toilets - pay business rates, the level depending on their rateable value.\n\nSome councils have given community groups exemptions for taking over and running toilets, while others are too small to pay the rates and are exempt.\n\nBut Mr Martin said some towns had seen many of their public toilets close due to the business rates, with some responsible in major cities having to pay thousands of pounds a year to run them.\n\nThe Non-Domestic Rating Public Lavatories Bill, promised in the 2018 autumn budget, would have meant anyone running public toilets in England and Wales would not have had to pay business rates.\n\nWhen Parliament was prorogued, the bill was one of a handful making their way through the legislative process which was dropped, and there is no guarantee the bill will be reintroduced when MPs return.\n\nIn theory the Welsh Government could introduce its own legislation as it is a devolved matter, with the assembly having to give consent for the UK bill to be introduced.\n\nIn a statement the Welsh Government said it was disappointed the bill had been lost and would be pushing for it to be reintroduced.\n\n'We took over the loos'\n\nImage copyright Lynne Pratten\u200e Image caption A community group has reopened the Six Bells Park toilets in Abertillery\n\nFaced with closure some in Wales have banded together to take over the running of their public toilets.\n\nThe Friends of Six Bells Park group, a group aged from 10 to 73 in Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, has brought the newly refurbished park's toilets back into use, so old and young people could enjoy their time there without the worry of being caught short.\n\n\"Having the toilets makes it so much more accessible for everyone,\" said mum Lynne Pratten.\n\nWhen Blaenau Gwent council closed all of its public toilets in November 2013, councillor Wayne Hodgins felt he had to act, and took on the management of a block in Brynmawr.\n\n\"We have a lot of elderly people - if someone arrives on a bus and we've got no toilet facilities, it would be quite ridiculous,\" he said.\n\nAnd in Caerphilly a group of taxi drivers took over the Station Terrace toilets, after they were shut by the council in April, amid protests from residents.\n\nDavid Miller, one of the taxi drivers, said: \"We have the second largest castle in Europe - for people to arrive and not be able to find a toilet anywhere, we thought it was wrong\".\n\nImage copyright Paul Fosh Image caption This public toilet in Dowlais is being turned into flats after being auctioned and sold for \u00a337,000 - six times more than its guide price\n\nCouncils in Wales are required to produce a toilet strategy, assessing local needs and working with businesses and other organisations to find solutions, under a public health law.\n\nBut there are fears that with councils trying to make increasing cuts, there may be more closures on the horizon.\n\nA spokeswoman for the UK Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, said: \"We will seek to reintroduce the bill as soon as Parliamentary time allows.\"", "description": "When Parliament was prorogued a Bill to scrap business rates for public loos in England and Wales stalled.", "authors": ["Rachel Flint", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/130F/production/_93997840_img_6650.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
