REUTERS/Kevin Coombs\n\nThis stretches even as far as the junior members of the squad. Before each match, the reserve players have been studying the tactics of their opponents\u2019 scrum and then replicating that in practice, giving the starting pack ideal preparation.\n\nThis has resulted in Japan consistently challenging their much heavier opponents at scrum time, something they will need to do on Sunday when they take on South Africa in the quarter-finals.\n\n\u201cWe make a firm strategy for a good scrum,\u201d said scrum coach Shin Hasegawa on Wednesday. \u201c(Hooker Takuya) Kitade and (back row Yoshitaka) Tokunaga are contributing and help us build our scrummaging strategy.\n\n\u201c(They make us realise) what we want to do and what sort of scrum we want to have. When they are able to do this it gives us immense confidence.\n\n\u201cWhen an opponent changes, our scrummaging changes and players change.\n\n\u201cWhen we feel that we need to educate each player (on various way of scrummaging), non-team members help us and give us comfort.\u201d\n\nSince taking over in 2016, Joseph has also looked to make his players\u2019 more independent.\n\nThis has meant relying on a leadership group containing the likes of captain Michael Leitch, flanker Pieter Labuschagne and flyhalf Yu Tamura.\n\nHis coaches have also had to adapt.\n\n\u201cIt is important for a coach to tell a player what he thinks but when I spoke to Jamie, I was told that I am being too much of a perfectionist,\u201d conceded Hasegawa.\n\n\u201cHe told me to let the players decide and give them independence. He taught me how players should spend a week to be able to correct themselves on the pitch.\u201d\n\nJoseph even employed a mental coach, David Galbraith, who has been challenging his players in situations of stress to try and replicate the decisions they will have to make on the field.\n\n\u201cHe makes quizzes and writes them on the whiteboard,\u201d revealed hooker Atushi Sakate.\n\n\u201cIt is part of the training, focusing on how to use your brain under pressure and in tough situations.\n\n\u201cYou have to make decisions during the toughest time during the match. You use your brain. That is why it was put up when you have tough weightlifting training.\u201d\n\nJapan know they will need all their wits about them against the experience of two-time champions South Africa in Tokyo on Sunday.", "description": "Attention to detail has been key to Japan's success so far at the Rugby World Cup, with coach Jamie Joseph preparing the players in camp since January and stressing the need for different game plans for each opponent.", "authors": ["Jack Tarrant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441458239&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0XY-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
