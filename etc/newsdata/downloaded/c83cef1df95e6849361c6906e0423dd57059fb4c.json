Business Insider will be on board, reporting from the test flight.\n\nThe flight, at nearly 10,000 miles and 20 hours long, presents several potential challenges, including how to keep passengers comfortable and pilots and cabin crew rested and alert.\n\nQantas has said it hopes to launch the route \u2013 and a direct between Sydney and London \u2013 by 2022.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nThe Australian airline Qantas is preparing to run its first nonstop test flight from New York City to Sydney, a route that no airline has been able to do without stopping. At 20 hours, it would be the world\u2019s longest flight, surpassing Singapore Airlines\u2019 nonstop flight to Newark airport near New York.\n\nBusiness Insider will be on board the New York-to-Sydney test flight, dubbed \u201cProject Sunrise,\u201d on Friday, reporting from the air.\n\nQantas also plans to test a nonstop flight from London to Sydney in the coming months. That route would be about 500 miles longer, adding up to an hour of flight time.\n\nAirplanes and airlines are more technically advanced than ever before, with better fuel efficiency, longer ranges, and computer-aided logistical planning. But as some flights get longer, the question is whether passengers and flight crews can tolerate more hours in the air without a layover to break things up.\n\nRight now, a commercially viable direct flight between Sydney and New York or London isn\u2019t possible. No commercial aircraft has the range to fly the nearly 10,000 miles with a full passenger and cargo load.\n\nTwo planes in development from Airbus and Boeing would have that capability. Qantas has said that it will decide by the end of 2019 which one it will use and that it expects to start commercial service as early as 2022.\n\nFor the test flight, the airline is using a brand-new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. It\u2019s taking delivery of the jet from Boeing\u2019s factory in Seattle, then flying it to New York to position for the trial run. To give the plane the range required for the nonstop flight, Qantas will have only about 50 people on board, including this reporter.\n\nQantas said the test flight would serve as a data-gathering mission, with a team of researchers from Sydney University on board and on the ground monitoring passengers\u2019 \u201csleep patterns, food and beverage consumption, lighting, physical movement and in-flight entertainment to assess impact on health, well-being and body clock.\u201d\n\nIt said that scientists from Monash University would monitor \u201ccrew melatonin levels before, during and after the flights\u201d and that pilots would \u201cwear an EEG (electroencephalogram) device that tracks brain wave patterns and monitors alertness.\u201d\n\nThe challenges of flying for 20 hours straight\n\nWhile the technical component of such a flight would be possible once Boeing and Airbus complete their ultra-long-haul jets, the toll on the human body and brain is a legitimate concern.\n\nNearly 20 hours in the air is a long time, particularly when you add time spent waiting for boarding to finish, for taxiing, and for runway availability. Even the best plane-sleepers can have trouble feeling rested, and landing 15 time zones away from the departure city can be disorienting. Meanwhile, the side effects of dry cabin air and the mild, usually harmless hypoxia that comes from being in a pressurized airplane cabin \u2013 dry skin, headaches, dehydration \u2013 are likely to be amplified by the longer flight time.\n\nRead more: I flew in Delta\u2019s extra-legroom seats to Iceland, and the flight was fine, but the extra space comes with a catch\n\nThat\u2019s aside from the perennial concern about blood clots in leg tissue, known as deep vein thrombosis, that can form after long periods of sitting still as blood pools in the lower extremities. While this is a risk on shorter flights as well, more time in the air without moving around can be problematic.\n\nJet lag, of course, is also an issue. While that would exist regardless of flight route \u2013 15 time zones is a lot to cross \u2013 symptoms can be exacerbated by the discomfort of an ultra-long-haul flight.\n\nThere are also concerns for the crew. Pilots and cabin crew members are prohibited from working past a certain number of hours, meaning Qantas will need to bring extra crew members to allow pilots and flight attendants to rest. However, the quality of rest (there are typically small crew quarters with beds hidden from passengers\u2019 view) can be subpar.\n\nQantas would need permission from Australia\u2019s aviation regulator to fly the route, as cabin crew members would need to be on duty for more than 20 hours \u2013 even with extras on board to facilitate rest periods \u2013 and the airline would need a new deal with pilots.\n\nThe upsides of a nonstop flight can make the challenges worth overcoming\n\nBut there are also numerous potential upsides.\n\nFlying from New York to Sydney now takes nearly 24 hours in the best case, with one stop, though flight times can also reach 40 hours with a longer layover. Qantas flies the route with about a 90-minute stop in Los Angeles.\n\nShaving four or five hours off that flight time can be crucial for business travelers who need to maximize time on the ground. Not having to stop and change planes could be useful for passengers.\n\nSince Qantas is likely to price the flights for business travelers whose companies are willing to pay a premium to save a few hours, there\u2019s a lot of profit potential. And modern long-haul planes, which are up to 20% more fuel-efficient than previous generations, can help keep costs down.\n\nThere\u2019s already precedent for the upsides. Last year, Singapore Airlines relaunched its direct flight to New York, currently the world\u2019s longest flight, and has seen a positive response. The direct flight, which otherwise took at least 21 hours with a stop, is scheduled at 18 1/2 hours.\n\nSee also: Boeing 737 timeline: From the early days to the grounding of the 737 Max after 2 fatal crashes that killed 346 people 5 months apart\n\nSingapore has operated ultra-long-haul flights for more than 10 years, even before relaunching the New York flight, and has found that passengers simply prefer to save time.\n\n\u201cThe convenience of bypassing intermediate points, as well as the opportunity for a longer window of uninterrupted sleep, are two of the principal benefits these flights deliver,\u201d an airline representative said. \u201cMany of our passengers travel between the US and Singapore (or beyond) one or more times per month, so the time savings becomes a critical business tool.\u201d\n\nJade Lynch, the head of marketing for FCM Travel Solutions Asia, is based in Singapore but frequently travels back to New York, where she lived previously. (Disclosure: Jade is a friend of mine.) She\u2019s found the nonstop flight indispensable.\n\n\u201cThe added time of stopping somewhere and breaking the journey up just isn\u2019t worth it to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI get more time on the ground when I fly direct, and when I factor in the time difference and losing time when traveling particularly between New York and Singapore, it seems like a connection is time wasted.\u201d\n\nSingapore flies an Airbus A350-900ULR on the route, outfitted with only business class and premium-economy seats \u2013 no cramped seating in regular coach. Qantas has not announced whether it plans to configure its planes similarly on its long-haul route.\n\nQantas\u2019 longest route right now \u2013 nonstop between London and Perth, about 17 hours \u2013 has also seen a positive response since launching in 2018. Flights are 94% full, on average, with more than 155,000 passengers flying the route in its first year, the airline said.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of expectations around this flight, both within Qantas and the broader community, and frankly it\u2019s exceeded them,\u201d said Alan Joyce, Qantas\u2019 CEO.\n\nWill it actually happen?\n\nQantas has been teasing the nonstop flights for years and is clearly excited about the prospect. Plus, Singapore\u2019s success suggests Qantas can expect similar outcomes.\n\nBut the challenges are certainly formidable. The first test flights should provide useful information about how to make sure passengers are comfortable \u2013 even though the mostly empty cabin will not perfectly replicate real-world conditions \u2013 and how to ensure that pilots and crew members can remain rested and alert enough to perform the flights. Based on the results, Qantas can begin to work on the regulatory and labor hurdles.\n\nOf course, economics remain a challenge as well. Fluctuating fuel prices and environmental concerns will also play a role, along with customer response.\n\nRead more: The Concorde made its final flight 16 years ago and supersonic air travel has yet to recover \u2013 here\u2019s a look back at its awesome history\n\nSimilarly, delays in aircraft development may force Qantas to push its hopeful launch date further back; it\u2019s unclear when Boeing\u2019s 777X aircraft will enter service. Qantas has also said it will launch the flights only if it can get a favorable price for the planes, regardless of whether it goes with Boeing or Airbus.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of enthusiasm for Sunrise, but it\u2019s not a foregone conclusion,\u201d Joyce said in an August statement announcing the test flights. \u201cThis is ultimately a business decision and the economics have to stack up.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - A flight from New York to Sydney is just under 10,000 miles and 20 hours.
