The members of our Armed Forces shine a light of freedom throughout the world, and as we celebrate our returning heroes, we also remember our heroes who never returned home. On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, our Nation recognizes all American prisoners of war and service members missing in action who have valiantly honored their commitment to this great country. Shares\n\nThree decades and counting ... for POW/MIA It is an image of focus, determination and strength. Here stands Artie Muller, his gaze steady, his denim vest bearing an American flag and a POW emblem. This is a photo from another age, from the early days of Rolling Thunder. The world has changed since then \u2014 but not Artie Muller, an Army vet who co-founded the patriotic group over three decades ago to draw attention to the cause of prisoners of war and those who never made it home. He's still got the iron will to honor the original mission, and inspire others to do the same. Shares\n\nSupporting our military every day On Memorial Day weekend in 1988, Rolling Thunder held a gathering and march in Washington, D.C. More than 2,500 motorcycles from all over the country converged into the city to demand from governmental leaders a full accounting of all POW/MIAs. Shares\n\nPOW/MIA priorities: Accountability for the missing, public education, health services for vets We are an organization comprised of U.S. military veterans, the families of veterans and those who believe in and are supportive of our agenda. The Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard are represented in our members. While our organization came into existence in the shadow of the Vietnam War, our membership has included those who served in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and all of the conflicts that have occurred around the world and drawn upon the U.S. military. Shares\n\nPOW/MIA Chair of Honor: A solemn reminder in the U.S. Capitol It is said that there is loyalty in the simple act of remembrance. In November, the United States Congress unveiled a Chair of Honor that sits empty in the United States Capitol as a tribute to those brave men and women who, in the course of their courageous military service, have been rendered missing in action or prisoners of war. Shares\n\nVeterans feel free on 'iron horses' Ever since we were children, the wind on our faces exhilarated us. Whether running as fast as you could or the first time accelerating on a bicycle, the feeling was exuberance. As adults, many of us seek ways to recreate those moments. Shares\n\nRemembering those who laid down their lives for our freedoms Memorial Day is a day we pay tribute to the men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our country safe and free. This year, Memorial Day takes on even greater meaning to me, as I just returned from an oversight visit to various World War I and World War II American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) sites. As chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have oversight responsibility of ABMC's work, both at home and abroad. ABMC employees have made it their life's work to make sure the sacrifice of the men and women who laid down their lives wearing the uniform of the United States of America is never forgotten. Walking those hallowed grounds that saw so much bloodshed for the cause of liberty is an experience I will never forget. Shares\n\nAmericans in 50 states honor POW/MIA flag In a dramatic effort to make sure Americans prisoners of war/missing in action \"are not forgotten,\" a veteran motorcyclist and thousands of allies have worked together to bring the haunting POW/MIA flag to all 50 states. Shares\n\nHonoring those who serve, today and every day To my fellow bikers, service members, veterans and to all who support our military members, as we pay our respects this Memorial Day to those who have given their lives to protect our great nation, let us recognize the contributions of all who have served. Shares\n\nRoll with Rolling Thunder's Memorial Day message What seems to be certain is that Mr. Kim is a millennial, among the generational cohort that views history as a fluid set of values, laws and rules that are meant to be broken and changed. Shares\n\nCherishing Old Glory -- and the freedom it represents Growing up, I was blessed to be able to escape the frenzied, fast-paced life of New York City's suburbs by spending my summers with my grandparents. Retreating to the mountains of northern New York, my grandparents taught me valuable and important life-lessons during my impressionable youth. I grew both in stature and in character each year as I modeled myself after the lessons my grandparents taught me, and all of those lessons were based on their faith. Looking back, I treasure those summers as having a lasting effect on the person I am today.

Some 2,500 bikes revving their engines at the Pentagon parking lot, waiting to begin the Memorial Day homecoming procession. Shares\n\nSonoSpine: An optimal choice for veterans and military forces Disbelief filled my mind as I passed by my co-worker's office door. My friend had complained about neck and back pain for as long as I had known him. He had decided to get something done about it not long after we completed a business review of an innovative spine surgery called SonoSpine. Shares\n\nThe long fight: Helicopter pilots from Vietnam War finally get their due with Arlington memorial The 2.5-by-2.5-foot granite block engraved with an image of an Army Huey commemorating Vietnam's air warriors proved an unexpectedly difficult fight. Shares\n\nVietnam helicopter pilots and crewmembers are not forgotten During the Vietnam War, nearly 5,000 American helicopter pilots and crewmembers lost their lives, fighting in what is often referred to as the \"Helicopter War.\" When I heard from Vietnam veterans in Wisconsin about the need for a national monument to honor these fallen heroes, I wanted to take action. Shares\n\nShining the spotlight on a group of true American heroes The Vietnam War was the first in which the United States military relied heavily on helicopters for transportation and combat. These pilots and crew members touched every aspect of efforts during the war, serving as transportation for soldiers and civilians, and providing critical battlefield support. Shares\n\nPressing ahead with bills to serve, honor vets For over 30 years, you have contributed to great legislative efforts to give veterans the rights, health care and support they have earned in service to this great country.
