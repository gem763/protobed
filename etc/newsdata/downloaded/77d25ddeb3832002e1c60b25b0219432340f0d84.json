I don\u2019t know how to describe it. We came out locked in and did a ton of damage. He made some mistakes, and we didn\u2019t let him get away with really any of them.\u201d\n\nHelped by six of their seven total homers, Houston raced to an 11-0 lead after two innings. The seven shots matched a franchise record for homers in a game set Sept. 9, 2000, against the Chicago Cubs.\n\nChirinos capped the first with a two-run homer and hit a three-run shot in the seventh. He added an RBI single in a five-run second inning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really special when you see a team put up that many runs in back-to-back games,\u201d Chirinos said. \u201cIt says a lot about the approach and the talent we have on this team.\u201d\n\nAlex Bregman started the offensive display with a three-run homer, and Alvarez followed with a solo shot into the second deck in right field.\n\nAlvarez hit his second solo shot into the third deck in right field in the second inning. Alvarez has 24 home runs, an Astros\u2018 rookie record, and has 72 RBIs in his first 71 games, which is tied for second-most in major league history with Ted Williams (1939) and Rudy York (1937), and trailing Walt Dropo\u2019s 80 (1949-50).\n\n\u201cWe thought this guy was going to be very impactful, but this is beyond belief or anything that people could have expected,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing historic things in a middle of a lineup. He\u2019s completely comfortable in the big leagues. . It\u2019s incredible to see the production.\u201d\n\nJose Altuve hit a two-run homer to left to start the scoring in the second, and Michael Brantley followed with a solo blast to right that chased Mike Fiers (14-4). Brantley\u2019s homer was his 21st, a career high.\n\nThe Astros extended their lead over Oakland to 10 \u00bd games in the AL West. They remain tied with the New York Yankees for the best record in the majors.\n\nGreinke (15-5) retired 11 of the first 12 batters he faced. He allowed just two hits and didn\u2019t walk a batter.\n\nHouston\u2019s offensive exploits spoiled Fiers\u2019 try at a piece of A\u2019s history. The right-hander had won 12 straight decisions and was bidding to match Hall of Famer Catfish Hunter\u2019s run in 1973 for the best since the club moved to the Bay Area.\n\n\u201cI feel like I didn\u2019t make the pitches I needed to make, and that\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t make them,\u201d Fiers said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t missing any mistakes.\u201d\n\nFiers allowed a career-high nine runs on nine hits in one-plus innings. He allowed a career-high five home runs.\n\n\u201cHe missed his spots a few times, and they are a home run hitting club,\u201d Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many runs they have scored the last two nights. They got on him early, and he didn\u2019t have an answer for that.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAthletics: OF Ram\u00f3n Laureano was out of the lineup a second straight day after leaving Saturday\u2019s game with cramps in his right leg.\n\nAstros: 1B Yuli Gurriel was out of the lineup for a third straight game with a sore left hamstring, but he took ground balls and ran prior to the game. \u2026 Correa fielded ground balls and took batting practice Monday.\n\nA\u2019S ROSTER MOVES\n\nOakland promoted LHP Jes\u00fas Luzardo and recalled RHP Daniel Mengden from Triple-A Las Vegas. To open up a spot on the 40-man roster for Luzardo, Oakland recalled OF Luis Barrera from Double-A Midland and placed him on the 60-day disabled list.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAthletics: RHP Tanner Roark (9-8, 3.86 ERA) starts Tuesday looking to continue his solid work since being acquired at the trade deadline. Roark has allowed two runs or fewer in four of his six starts with the Athletics.\n\nAstros: LHP Wade Miley (13-4, 3.35) starts Tuesday looking to rebound after yielding five runs without recording an out in his last start Thursday against the Mariners.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Houston Astros showed how powerful their lineup can be for a second straight game.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/athletics_astros_baseball_68151_c0-78-5053-3024_s1770x1032.jpg?94fda1fc27e7e62d0cdb1d264efb732776e89ee4", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
