While Harvey Weinstein is never directly named as the heavy-hitter in question, his specter haunts every frame of the film, along with recent Emmy winner Julia Garner as the assistant in question. The film had its world premiere at the 2019 Telluride Film Festival to critical acclaim and will be released on January 31, 2020.\n\nPer the film\u2019s official synopsis, it \u201cfollows one day in the life of Jane (Julia Garner), a recent college graduate and aspiring film producer, who has recently landed her dream job as a junior assistant to a powerful entertainment mogul. Her day is much like any other assistant\u2019s \u2014 making coffee, changing the paper in the copy machine, ordering lunch, arranging travel, taking phone messages, onboarding a new hire. As Jane follows her daily routine, she, and we, grow increasingly aware of the abuse that insidiously colors every aspect of her work day, an accumulation of degradations against which Jane decides to take a stand, only to discover the true depth of the system into which she has entered.\u201d\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nIn IndieWire\u2019s review at this year\u2019s Telluride Film Festival, where the film premiered, Eric Kohn wrote that the film has a \u201cstunning performance at its center, \u2026 there\u2019s no doubting the hypnotic power of a movie that digs inside Weinstein\u2019s harrowing reign and observes the mechanics that allowed it to last so long. A quiet work with major ambitions, \u2018The Assistant\u2019 is a significant cultural statement in cinematic form.\u201d\n\nIn an official statement, Green said, \u201cI\u2019m so thrilled that \u2018The Assistant\u2019 is in the hands of a team with such passion and vision for sharing it with the world.\u201d Added producer Jen Dana, \u201cWe\u2019re so proud of this movie, both on its own terms as a cinematic experience and for how it contributes to the ongoing conversation about gender, power, and women\u2019s roles in the workplace. It is wonderful to have a partner in Bleecker Street who will support both Kitty as a filmmaker and help drive the necessary broader conversation surrounding the movie.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the filmmakers, producers, and financiers announced an exciting partnership with The New York Women\u2019s Foundation. This partnership will see 10% of their profits set aside to support the organization. The film is produced by Kitty Green, Scott Macaulay, James Schamus, and P. Jennifer Dana and Ross Jacobson of 3311 Productions. Executive producers are John Howard, Philipp Engelhorn and Leah Giblin of Cinereach, Abigail E. Disney, The Level Forward Team, Mark Roberts, Sean King O\u2019Grady, and Avy Eschesnasy.\n\nThe film will lead off Bleecker Street\u2019s 2020 release slate, following by \u201cOrdinary Love\u201d on February 14, Sally Potter\u2019s untitled latest on March 13, \u201cMilitary Wives\u201d on March 27, and \u201cDream Horse\u201d on May 1.\n\nBest of IndieWire\n\nSign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.
