That's a cool $100 off the RRP. However, there are a few hoops you need to jump through to get the deal. Here are the details.\n\nFor those who missed the July announcement, the Nintendo Switch Lite is a more compact version of its bestselling portable console. It comes with a smaller 5.5-inch screen, non-removable Joy-Con controllers, longer battery life and a range of cute colour choices.\n\nFrom midday on Tuesday September 17, eBay will be knocking $100 off the brand new Nintendo Switch Lite video game console. So what's the catch?\n\nFirstly, the deal is only available to eBay Plus members, which is eBay's premium subscription service. If you're not signed into your Plus account, you won't be able to purchase this deal. Non Plus members can sign up for a free 30-day trial here.\n\nSecondly, you need to keep your eyes peeled for the product on eBay's Deals page. According to the company, the Nintendo Switch Lite will be appearing on the site in batches with additional units added at hourly interviews between 12pm and 5pm AEST. So if you miss out on the first attempt, keep heading back each hour.\n\nThe console will be available from eBay in three colours: yellow, grey or turquoise. (We advise just grabbing whichever colour you can get your hands on, as stock will be very limited.)\n\nIf the above sounds like too much trouble, you can also get the console from Amazon Australia for $299. That's not quite as good, but definitely beats the $329.95 RRP. Members of Amazon Prime - which also has a free trial - can bump that price down a little further to $288.\n\nYou can check out the terms and conditions of the sale here.\n\nNintendo Switch Lite: Australian Specs, Price And Release Date The Nintendo Switch Lite has been announced and it's heading to Australian shores in September. With the new release comes a slightly more affordable price point of $329.95 and three schmick colours.
