According to Radar Online, which obtained a copy of the book, Moore, 56, reportedly confirms what had been long-rumored: that they had threesomes while they were married. She also wrote about giving up 20-years of sobriety to appeal to Kutcher.\n\nThe pair, who have a 15 year age gap, met in 2003 and married two years later. At some point after that in their troubled union, the That \u201870s Show star asked her to have a threesome \u2014 and she agreed.\n\n\u201cI wanted to show him how great and fun I could be,\u201d wrote Moore, who admitted to two hookups involving an unidentified third person.\n\nShe now views it as a \u201cmistake,\u201d the tabloid noted.\n\nPart of that \u201cmistake\u201d was because it blurred the boundaries in their marriage. She wrote that while filming Another Happy Day in New York City in 2010, she read a tabloid report that Kutcher had cheated with a 21-year-old woman named Brittney Jones in their marital home. It claimed that he met the woman while bowling with Moore\u2019s eldest daughter Rumer Willis, which Moore said in her book felt like a \u201creal f**k you.\u201d\n\nAnd she didn\u2019t feel like her husband was apologetic.\n\n\u201cBecause we had brought a third party into our relationship, Ashton said, that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he\u2019d done,\u201d wrote Moore, who felt he had tried to \u201cdeflect blame.\u201d\n\nMoore also wrote about what ultimately split them up \u2014 when she got a Google alert claiming he cheated with a woman at his pal Danny Masterson\u2019s San Diego bachelor party. It was the weekend of their sixth wedding anniversary.\n\n\u201cI felt sick to my stomach,\u201d Moore wrote. She said she knew the woman involved, Sara Leal, who gave an interview to the media, \u201cwasn\u2019t lying.\u201d\n\nAmid their split in 2011, Star magazine reported about the couple having threesomes, their \u201copen marriage\u201d and Kutcher \u201cstraying\u201d from their rules.\n\nDemi Moore and her Ashton Kutcher arrive for the premiere of \"The House Bunny\" in 2008.

She claimed that early in their romance they took a romantic trip to Mexico, where Kutcher, while drinking a glass of red wine, said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if alcoholism is a real thing \u2014 I think it\u2019s all about moderation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think, \u2018This is a kid in his twenties who has no idea what he\u2019s talking about,\u2019\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cInstead, I cast about for justifications for his argument.\u201d\n\nThat night, in an effort to impress and appeal to her younger beau, she drank a beer from the minibar. It was the start of a spiral that lasted many years.\n\nAs previously reported, Moore became pregnant early in the couple\u2019s relationship but lost the baby \u2014 which they had a named picked out for \u2014 at six months. She leaned on drinking and \u2014 eventually other things \u2014 to cope with the pain.\n\n\u201cDrinking became interwoven in my pain,\u201d Moore wrote in the book.", "description": "Stories from Demi Moore\u2019s memoir, \"Inside Out,\" continue to trickle out ahead of its Sept. 24 release.", "authors": ["Suzy Byrne", "Editor", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0ZJ6JeAkFsbY.i_sgZb4NQ--~B/aD0yNTIwO3c9MzY3ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/0481c670-dbb8-11e9-9fff-327b1542b644"}
