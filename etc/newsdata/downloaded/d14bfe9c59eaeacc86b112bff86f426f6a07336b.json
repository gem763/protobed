REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nAttorneys general for 50 U.S. states and territories along with the U.S. Department of Justice appear to be acting on accusations from rivals, lawmakers and consumer advocacy groups that the biggest seller of online ads engages in unfair tactics. Google disputes its dominance.\n\n\u201cAd tech is a very crowded field, and Google competes with hundreds of companies, including household names like Adobe, Amazon, AT&T, Comcast, News Corp and Verizon,\u201d company spokesman Josh Zeitz said. \u201cPublishers and advertisers mix and match technology partners to meet their different needs, creating both competition and innovation.\u201d\n\nLater, in response to this story, Google reiterated in a blog post here that its services foster competition.\n\n\u201cOur tools and platforms make it easy for advertisers and publishers of all sizes to choose whom they want to work with in this open, interconnected ad system,\u201d Google Vice President Sissie Hsiao wrote.\n\nHere are five common concerns about Google raised by 10 ad industry executives, most speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nSEARCH AND YOUTUBE\n\nAbout 80% of Google\u2019s ad revenue and most of its profits come from ads within Google search results, YouTube, Gmail and other internet services the company owns. Rivals say that Google controls these properties in a way that hinders advertising competition.\n\nFor instance, the only technology system for buying ads on YouTube, the world\u2019s largest video streaming website, is Google\u2019s ad buying tool. Services such as Facebook Inc (FB.O) maintain similar control, in part to limit too widely sharing users\u2019 data. But as YouTube increasingly dominates online video, rival tools for placing ads in video streams become less attractive to advertisers because they can only access smaller audiences.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult to compete with the monopoly search and video sites,\u201d said Brian O\u2019Kelley, founder and former CEO of ad tech company AppNexus, in an interview in June.\n\nACQUISITIONS\n\nThe remaining 20% of Google\u2019s ad revenue is from what is commonly referred to as its \u201cdisplay business.\u201d Google boosted this operation by acquiring seller tools such as DoubleClick for $3.1 billion in 2008 and AdMob for $750 million in 2010 and then buyer services including Invite Media for a reported $81 million in 2010.\n\nThe combination of deals gave Google unprecedented positioning in every facet of how ads end up on websites and smartphone apps around the world. Though U.S. regulators approved the deals, their worst-case predictions about Google being too powerful have come true, rivals say.\n\nTo poach big customers from Google, smaller firms say they would need the cash to diversify their businesses and develop a complete suite of services. But drawing investment has been challenging because of the looming threats of Google and increased data privacy regulation.\n\nBUNDLING\n\nGoogle\u2019s variety of ad tools enable it to bundle them in a way that rivals say they cannot afford to match. For instance, websites and app owners, together known as publishers, over the years have become reliant on Google\u2019s DoubleClick ad serving tool. Nearly free to use for publishers, it is the only system of its kind that can receive real-time bids from Google\u2019s ads marketplace, known in the industry as AdX.\n\nThe popular marketplace, which matches up ad buyers with publishers, is where Google collects high fees.\n\nRivals said when using the Google ad-buying tool, advertisers get some key consumer data for free, early access to some purchasing options and potentially additional benefits if transacting through AdX. Google\u2019s packages for buyers and sellers to boost use of AdX are viewed as anticompetitive by rivals.\n\n\u201cThe ubiquity of Google\u2019s ad server provides virtually total control over which ads are shown and monetized for the majority of the Internet,\u201d said Romain Job, chief strategy officer at competitor Smart AdServer. \u201cThis control of the ad server is strategically critical to Google.\u201d\n\nLAST LOOK\n\nGoogle has allowed publishers using DoubleClick to sell ad space on various marketplaces, not just AdX. But for many years, Google\u2019s AdX widely held a special advantage: At the last second it could give its customers the opportunity to outbid competing advertisers trying to purchase through other, non-Google, marketplaces.\n\nThis \u201clast look\u201d was one of several ways rivals allege Google favored itself. Google last week announced that the elimination of \u201clast look\u201d as part of move to a new sales system.\n\nBut publishers and rivals still wonder whether Google may be using its vantage point over the whole ecosystem to keep prices down for advertisers and make itself outperform other marketplaces by analyzing their matchmaking strategies and copying them. Among specific concerns is that just being part of Google enables AdX to glean more information than rival exchanges about consumers, making AdX more attractive to advertisers.\n\nCHROME\n\nThe newest area of concern is how Google may be using its Chrome internet browser, which has about 50% market share in the United States, to restrict most advertising systems, beside its own, from building profiles on consumers as they browse the web.\n\nThe restrictions, many of which remain proposals subject to change, largely spare Google because consumers often sign into their Google accounts when using Chrome. That enables a form of tracking that it is not possible for ad tech firms that do not offer any services directly to users.\n\nGoogle has said its initiative is aimed at helping users curb tracking, as they demand greater privacy protections. Other browser makers have adopted more stringent restrictions, but Google has said its striving for a middle ground between violating users\u2019 privacy and violating antitrust rules.", "description": "U.S. authorities investigating Alphabet Inc's Google for anticompetitive behavior have recently begun probing the company's $116 billion-a-year advertising business.", "authors": ["Paresh Dave", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428918940&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1PN", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
