It is not a situation I wished and would want. It is not an ideal situation. It is rare to have so many absences.\"\n\nThe coach said Reus, who was nursing a minor knee injury, would train later on Tuesday.\n\n\"We will have to see. He will train this evening and then we will see if it makes sense to use him tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nGermany, who travel to Estonia in their Euro 2020 qualifier on Sunday, are sitting top of Group C on 12 points from five matches, after losing to Netherlands in September. Northern Ireland are second on goal difference.\n\nLoew called up Robin Koch and Sebastian Rudy late on Monday, reacting to a string of earlier withdrawals. \"They will join the team this afternoon,\" Loew said.\n\n\"It is a tense situation and not a happy one. It will be difficult to have high expectations from the team. But the team will be engaged and serious because Argentina are a tough opponent.\"\n\nArgentina also have their share of absences, including world footballer of the year Lionel Messi as well as Angel Di Maria and Sergio Aguero.
