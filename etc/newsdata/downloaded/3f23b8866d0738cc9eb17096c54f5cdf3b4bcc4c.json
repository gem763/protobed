Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, left, listens as Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Russell Vought testifies before the House Budget Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 12, 2019, during a hearing on the fiscal year 2020 budget. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nAfter weeks of getting nowhere with Schiff and Co. when it comes to being given full access to impeachment inquiry documents and transcripts from the secretive hearings and witness testimonies, dozens of House Republicans finally organized as a group this week to stop talking and start taking action.\n\nThey organized a sit-in Wednesday (complete with lunch served) in the SCIF where the witnesses have been questioned, but ultimately did not get what they wanted from Schiff.\n\nAnother Republican who took action but in a different way yesterday was Rep. Dan Crenshaw (TX), who tweeted out a video talking about the rules Schiff has made up regarding how this inquiry will be conducted. Here\u2019s how he started out:\n\n\u201cChairman Adam Schiff says that non-committee members can\u2019t have access to all the hearings and depositions that have been happening with respect to the impeachment inquiry. Is that true?\u201d he wondered.\n\nCrenshaw then pointed to the House Rules and Manual for the current Congress. \u201cLet\u2019s check the House rules,\u201d he stated, opening the book up to page 568 of this document.\n\nReading the text, Crenshaw said that \u201cSuch records shall be the property of the House and each member, meaning we can actually go look at them.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a screen grab from the actual rule book, on page 568 (page 567 is where the rules on committee records start):\n\nAt that point, he noted he was going to go downstairs to where the records were kept to see if he would be given access to them.\n\nWatch the video of him pointing out the relevant House rule, and to see what happens when he tries to get access:\n\nAdam Schiff isn't allowing Reps. to see the transcripts from this impeachment inquiry, but selectively leaks small portions to the press. This process should be transparent to the American people. It should be a fair process w/ clear rules, just like past impeachment inquiries. pic.twitter.com/Rg2AKtRHIM \u2014 Rep. Dan Crenshaw (@RepDanCrenshaw) October 23, 2019\n\nHe wasn\u2019t allowed to film what was going on inside the secure committee room, but when he came out he stated they would\u2019t let him see anything, saying they repeated the Schiff rule to him about non-committee members and records access.\n\nBut Crenshaw said he has spoken to committee members who have also sent letters requesting to see impeachment inquiry documents as well but have also been told no. \u201cWhere is the transparency?\u201d Crenshaw asked rhetorically. \u201cThere\u2019s none.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic clown show continues.\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\n\u2014 Based in North Carolina, Sister Toldjah is a former liberal and a 16+ year veteran of blogging with an emphasis on media bias, social issues, and the culture wars.
