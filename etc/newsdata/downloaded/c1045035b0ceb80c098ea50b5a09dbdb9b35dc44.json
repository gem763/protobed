If its a REIT which is currently distributing close to 90% of its REIT taxable income and the REIT has a realized capital gain, then the CG will be distributed separately along with the usual dividend. NHI did this for several years.\n\nIf key executives have large stock holdings, this could be a form of a bonus to them and if its a C-Corp, the dividends, providing there are sufficient earnings, will receive the more favorable qualified dividend tax treatment over ordinary income.\n\nOccasionally a company will purchase another company that has a large Receivables account that the new owner does not wish to administer and so will sell it and distribute the proceeds as a special dividend. The insurance company CINF did this a couple of years ago.\n\nCBRL is an example of a company paying special dividends over the past 4 years, simply because they've accrued too much cash and they do not rush into non-core investments just to make use of the cash. Everything about CBRL's cash flows says 'conservative' and 'focused'. If management has the discipline to stick with what they're good at and manage down their expenses while continuing to provide a product in demand, excess cash flow will follow.\n\nAnd special dividends or not, I would avoid any kind of a cyclical like F. Due to their large and somewhat fixed labor costs during recessions, F's dividend is simply not reliable. After years of dividend growth, they cut it in 2001, held it at a flate $.10 2002-mid 2006, suspended it 2006 to 2011 and began slow growth beginning with the renewed $.05 dividend in 2012 with special dividends paid since. This dividend is just too schizophrenic for my household income need.\n\nBruceM", "description": "Any thoughts? https://dividendpower.org/2019/08/29/3-stocks-that-pay-an-annual-special-dividend-and-yielding-over-5/ - 20600", "authors": ["Explorer", "Participant", "Contributor"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D"}
