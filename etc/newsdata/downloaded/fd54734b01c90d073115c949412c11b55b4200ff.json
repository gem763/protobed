She is probably the best chance for Democrats to win the Senate seat in Georgia. And winning back the Senate means Democrats would wrestle back control of nominations, judicial appointments -- including to the Supreme Court -- and position Congress to fix the disaster of the Trump years with a Democrat in the White House.\n\nBut Abrams isn't passing up the opportunity to take a lucrative job in the tobacco industry or even a high-powered law firm. Instead, she's leading an effort to make every vote count in the next election with her initiative Fair Fight 2020.\n\nThere is more than one way to be a public servant. Running for office is a grueling, often thankless and noble pursuit. But so is running an organization to register more voters and address voter suppression.

That alone will help more Democratic officials get elected and maybe even in the White House.\n\nRead More", "description": "Jen Psaki writes that there is more than one way to be a public servant.
