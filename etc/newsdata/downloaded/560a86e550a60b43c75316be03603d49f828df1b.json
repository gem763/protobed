Graham: Trump is now in open defiance of Congress\n\nThe judge\u2019s opinion is likely to be appealed and might be stayed, but his indignant dismissal points to the flaw in the Trump legal argument. The president has repeatedly expressed a yearning for the powers of an autocrat, and has successfully subordinated the power of the executive branch to pursuing his will\u2014from chasing conspiracy theories around the globe to the Justice Department intervening in this case on the president\u2019s side. But there are leaks in the hull: federal judges who don\u2019t answer to Trump, whistle-blowers and inspectors general who sidestep his power, and state and local authorities who aren\u2019t bound by federal law.\n\nSince taking control of the House in January 2018, Democrats have fired off a fusillade of subpoenas at Trump and his associates. To fight these off, Trump\u2019s attorneys have advanced aggressive legal theories. They\u2019ve instructed current and former aides not to testify, citing executive privilege. The White House has even claimed that Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump-campaign aide who\u2019s never worked for the executive branch, is subject to privilege.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have also questioned Congress\u2019s authority. When House committees have sought financial documents, including tax returns\u2014which the House can obtain under federal law\u2014from Trump\u2019s accounting firm and banks, the Justice Department has argued there is not \u201clegitimate legislative purpose\u201d for requesting them; it\u2019s just harassment. Attempting to foil this, Democrats argued that the requests were kinda-sorta part of an impeachment inquiry: They didn\u2019t want to admit they were trying to impeach Trump, but they also wanted to demonstrate a clear constitutional purpose behind their requests.\n\nHouse Democrats: Why we\u2019re moving forward with impeachment\n\nLitigation in those requests is still in process, though the question of impeachment has now been resolved, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s green light for an impeachment inquiry in September. Now that Democrats are working under that umbrella, Trump has attacked the inquiry, saying it amounts to a coup and that voters should decide his fate. Following Trump\u2019s logic, Congress can\u2019t pursue oversight if it\u2019s not impeaching, and can\u2019t pursue oversight if it is.\n\nMeanwhile, with the White House stonewalling Congress, state governments have begun acting. California passed a law requiring candidates for president to disclose tax returns (the law has been challenged), and New York passed a law allowing Congress access to candidates\u2019 New York State returns if requested. Meanwhile, Vance subpoenaed Trump\u2019s tax returns from his accounting firm in connection with hush-money payments to the porn actress Stormy Daniels.", "description": "A federal judge dismisses Trump\u2019s \u201climitless assertion of presidential immunity.\u201d", "authors": ["David A.
