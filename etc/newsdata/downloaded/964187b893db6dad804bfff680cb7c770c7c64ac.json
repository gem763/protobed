House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the Democratic-controlled House would begin impeachment proceedings.\n\nSingh's comments on impeachment\n\nSingh is the first of the Canadian party leaders to comment directly on the possible impeachment of Trump. But his position seems to have evolved over the past three days.\n\n\"Congress members will make the decision,\" Singh said in French on Wednesday outside Vancouver's city hall during a media conference. \"I think there's a lot of proof to move forward with these proceedings.\"\n\nBy contrast, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer this week simply declared they would keep an eye on how things evolved when asked how they thought the impeachment proceedings may affect ratification of the renegotiated North American trade deal.", "description": "NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told a Town Hall audience in Victoria B.C. that he was serious when he said that he hopes U.S. President Donald Trump is impeached.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5301343.1569638599!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jagmeet-singh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
