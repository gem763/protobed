He was just 21.\n\nThe South Korean staff sergeant had volunteered to lead an early morning patrol after a colleague was assigned to training. That made him the first to go through an entry gate into the DMZ, signaling to the seven others on the patrol to wait, as he stepped forward.\n\nThe next thing Ha remembered was being thrown to the ground in unspeakable pain, both his legs stripped to the bone. The other soldiers were also wounded, though less severely.\n\nHa is now hoping to turn the rowing skills he picked up in rehabilitation into a place at the Paralympics at next year\u2019s summer games.\n\n\u201cI just felt so relaxed when I went out on the water in a boat for the first time,\u201d Ha said during his training session.\n\n\u201cI have to be careful and stay focused on the river, which doesn\u2019t allow for other thoughts, and keeps me at ease.\u201d\n\nThe incident on that fateful August morning has forever changed Ha\u2019s life. He now relies on prosthetic legs, which he said he was so glad to learn to use as he could finally walk again, albeit \u201clike a baby taking his very first steps\u201d.\n\nApart from the physical pain, Ha said he also had to fight to quell feelings of hatred for North Korea, which South Korea blames for planting the landmine he stepped on.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I don\u2019t get mad at North Korea,\u201d he said. \u201cBut just as I was a soldier myself, those who laid the mines must have followed an order. So sometimes I wonder what\u2019s the point of blaming them.\u201d\n\nHa left the military in January and joined a national para rowing team, winning a series of national and global competitions. He is hopeful but realistic about his chances as a newcomer, and aims to earn a spot at the Tokyo games and to eventually win a gold medal in France in 2024.\n\n\u201cIt was my first race last year. I had no skills, nothing but physical power, but I won. It was absolutely thrilling, I was like, \u2018this is it\u2019,\u201d Ha said.\n\nHa\u2019s physical strength and willpower, as well as the discipline gained from his time in the military, fueled his rapid ascent in the endurance sport, said Lim Myung-woong, the national team coach who encouraged his transition.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nHa likes to wear shorts to put his black prosthetic legs on show, part of his efforts to help change social attitudes toward people with disabilities.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t something to be ashamed of,\u201d he said, staring at his blades with a faint smile.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t despair, I just don\u2019t think. I\u2019m as simple as that.\u201d", "description": "Pulling with smooth, steady strokes along a rowing course on an artificial lake, South Korean Paralympic hopeful Ha Jae-hun is the picture of calm determination, but it has taken him four years and 21 rounds of surgery to find this peace.", "authors": ["Hyonhee Shin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441674982&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G00W", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
