-\n\nAid groups have warned of yet another humanitarian disaster in Syria's eight-year-old war if the offensive is not stopped.\n\nFrance, a key partner in the US-led anti-IS coalition, has threatened sanctions against NATO member Turkey.\n\nTurkey is still far from having reached the goals of its military invasion but the risk appears to be growing that detained IS fighters could break free.\n\nKurdish officials said five IS prisoners managed to escape from a Qamishli facility housing mostly foreign jihadists after shelling struck nearby.", "description": "Ras al-Ain (Syria) (AFP) - Battles raged Friday as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to press an assault against Kurdish forces in Syria, dismissing \"threats\" from other countries while the US warned Ankara of fresh sanctions.
