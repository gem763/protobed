They are young, and the population is growing.\"\n\nAccording to Adam, immigration and population projections indicate Toronto will see a significant increase in francophones over the next 10 years.\n\nShe isn't ruling Cornwall out entirely, however.\n\n\"The [UOF] is planning to have a satellite in the eastern region one day,\" she said. \"I guess it's not impossible.\"\n\nThe federal government has provided $1.9 million to build the UOF.", "description": "Cornwall, Ont., is putting in a pitch to become home to Ontario's newest\u00a0francophone university \u2014 despite every indication the facility is heading to Toronto.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4929115.1567938961!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/woman-protest-franco-ontarian-ottawa-city-hall-francophone-service-cuts-french.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
