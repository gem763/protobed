The F-15 is non-stealthy as a fighter can get, but has a 33 percent higher maximum speed of Mach 2.5 and a longer range.\n\nAs foreign air forces have ordered more and more heavily modernized F-15s over the last few decades, Boeing is offering to an F-15EX variant that will incorporate all those new bits of technology (detailed here)\u2014while also incorporating the multirole capability the F-15C lacks.\n\nThough the F-15EX\u2019s proponents argue that the money spent wouldn\u2019t detract from F-35 funding, Lockheed and most of the air force brass don\u2019t see it that way and strenuously object. In the last few years, the Defense Department has repeatedly tilted towards Boeing in competition, and one of the acting defense secretaries was a former Boeing executive.\n\nFor now, eight F-15EXs are on an initial order for $1.1 billion\u2014with that possibly serving as a precursor for 144 more.\n\nSo just how well can these aircraft perform various missions?\n\nPenetrating Strike\n\nRussian, China and their export clients are increasingly fielding powerful radars and surface-to-air missile systems that can detect and shoot missiles at conventional fighters like the F-15EX from over 100 miles away.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Which is right for the Air Force of the future?", "authors": ["Sebastien Roblin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YfGoMl.RpQym8WNuSJCdLw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/acbb027d0355a5163baaa633bd1fca00", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
