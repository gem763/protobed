It comes down to being key when it comes to the tariff situation and how Tesla is potentially impacted. I think right now it [the impact] has been tepid. But if this heats up it could definitely be a black cloud for the company which is viewed as a potential positive going into next year,\u201d Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives explained on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.\n\nChina is Tesla\u2019s biggest international market by a wide margin, hauling in $1.5 billion in sales through the second quarter. The company reportedly saw strong sales of the Model 3, Model X and Model S in the third quarter in China, following the government\u2019s decision to grant a 10% purchase tax reduction tax to the company.\n\nSidestepping tariffs\n\nIn effect, the move was seen as a gift to Tesla by the Chinese government \u2014 it helps Tesla sidestep the cost increases from the 25% tariffs on U.S. auto imports set to kick in on December 15 by unlocking consumer demand. Stoking that demand in China for Tesla is vital \u2014 by some accounts, those 25% tariffs along with existing duties on auto imports has raised the potential for autos to cost 50% more in China post December 15.\n\nSHANGHAI, Jan. 7, 2019 -- Guests attend the groundbreaking ceremony of Tesla Shanghai gigafactory in Shanghai, east China, Jan. 7, 2019.

That would leave Tesla exposed to the 25% tariffs. Considering Tesla is already ridiculously expensive in China, the company\u2019s sales could be materially hurt until it gets its Shanghai-based manufacturing plant up and running.\n\nIves is staying somewhat upbeat on Tesla, however.\n\n\u201cI think the doomsday scenarios continue to be off the table. Some of the hate has been overdone, but yet for this stock to move higher Tesla needs to prove itself that it could be profitable on the lower margin Model 3 and what sustainable demand is,\u201d Ives said.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
