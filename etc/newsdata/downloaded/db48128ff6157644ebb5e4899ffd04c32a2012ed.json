The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2014 the US's main ally in the fight against Isis in Syria \u2014 called the move \"a stab in the back\", having lost some 11,000 fighters in the years-long fight with the jihadists.\n\nTurkish forces then began an massive ground and air offensive into northeastern Syria three days later, which has killed at least 10 civilians and displaced some 70,000. Ankara views the Kurdish forces as terrorists and accuses them of having links to Kurdish separatists in Turkey.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happened here,\u201d Mr Newton said.\n\n\u201cNot all Kurds are terrorists. For the Turks to make that argument is fundamentally wrong. What the Turks have done is to take an over-expansive view. The right answer would have been \u2014 and was working \u2014 a carefully-coordinated strategic plan to eliminate real terrorists.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are ways to conduct counter-terrorism campaigns that don\u2019t include the wholesale slaughter of Kurdish forces.\u201d\n\nOther US veterans have this week joined the chorus of condemnation against the decision, citing the Soldier\u2019s Creed which states a soldier \u201cwill never leave a fallen comrade\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Iraq [sic] and Syria and hearing your comrades under attack and being able to do nothing.\u201d\n\nMr Manning later told The Independent: \u201cJust like there are Kurds who are alive because of US forces, there are Americans who are alive because of sacrifices the Kurds made for us. Abandoning them to the Turkish military forces who want to raze their villages and cities is not the way to repay that debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Kurdish intelligence, while not always perfect, was invaluable to how we understood the threat and nature of Iraq and the region,\u201d he added.\n\nThe official Twitter account for the Special Operation Joint Task Force in Iraq and Syria, which previously fought alongside Kurdish forces, posted the hashtag in a tweet that has since been deleted.\n\nIn an Op-Ed for The Independent published on Wednesday, army veteran Charlotte Clymer described the Soldier's Creed as \u201ca bedrock principle in the US military that goes back to the Revolutionary War, when our country was little more than a coalition of states seeking to overthrow an abusive tyrant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will lead to a slaughter of innocents who have supported our country through thick and thin,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe Kurds, who have been continually oppressed and brutalized, stuck with the United States because we essentially promised them survival. We gave our word as a supposed country of honour based on the principles of our founding: that all people should be free to set the shape of their destinies.\u201d\n\nExperts said Mr Trump\u2019s decision could lead to a vacuum in the region that allows for the resurgence of ISIS. Meanwhile, Turkey\u2019s advancement into Syria has already reportedly hampered Kurdish operations, which included the oversight of tens of thousands of ISIS prisoners who have been detained throughout the years-long conflict.\n\nAsked about the possibility of those ISIS prisoners escaping, Mr Trump told reporters earlier this week: \u201cWell, they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe.\u201d\n\nHe also threatened \u201cfar more than sanctions\u201d against Turkey if it failed to advance into Syria \u201cin as humane a way as possible\u201d.", "description": "A US veteran who fought alongside the Kurds said Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out of northern Syria was an \u201cabandonment of trust\u201d and warned it could lead to the \"wholesale slaughter\" of America's allies.\u00a0 Michael Newton, an army veteran with deployment experience in Operation Provide Comfort, which defended Kurdish civilians as they fled their homes in northern Iraq", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/15/turkey-syria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
