I was in bed with one of my mates and apparently I have tried to grab his cock.\n\n\"You do not know how scared I am to be in bed with a girl.\"\n\nOther male friends described Kelly engaging in \"sex talk\" with them on the phone as he slept.", "description": "Dale Kelly, 21, poses a threat not only to the girl he performed a sex act on but women in general, a judge at York Crown Court said", "authors": ["Mark Branagan", "Image", "Pa", "Pa Archive Press Association Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20419338.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Dale-Kelly-court-caseED.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
