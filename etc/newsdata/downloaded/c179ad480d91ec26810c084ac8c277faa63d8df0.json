Ulrich Brechbuhl.\n\nThe House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs Committees have also sent out a number of subpoenas as their parts of the impeachment probe expand.\n\nMost recently they targeted Energy Secretary Rick Perry, as well as Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman \u2014 two associates of the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani that were involved in his efforts to open an Ukrainian investigation into the Biden family.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
