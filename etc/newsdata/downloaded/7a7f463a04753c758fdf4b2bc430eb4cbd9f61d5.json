It turned into an embarrassing lowlight instead.\n\nThe play started when Philadelphia Phillies utility man Scott Kingery hit a long fly ball to center field, which Acu\u00f1a tracked to the wall and made a leaping catch. Acu\u00f1a appeared to have hauled it in, but didn\u2019t complete the process of the catch and saw the ball leak out of his glove as he hauled it down.\n\nRather than immediately pick up the ball and throw it into the infield, Acu\u00f1a spent precious seconds waving his arms to appeal to the umpires that he had still made the catch.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAtlanta Braves center fielder Ronald Acuna Jr. cannot hang onto an inside the park home run by Philadelphia Phillies' Scott Kingery during the third inning of a baseball game, Tuesday, Sept. 10, 2019, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nBy the time Acu\u00f1a got the ball in, Kingery was rounding third and scored the inside-the-park home run on a close play at home.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that is a brutal sequence for the 21-year-old Acu\u00f1a. The Braves felt the effects of that inside-the-park homer, as they ended up losing 6-5. Acu\u00f1a at least made up for it with his bat by going 3-for-5 with a run.\n\nThis is the second questionable-effort play Acu\u00f1a has made in as many months, as he received a benching from manager Brian Snitker in August for spending time admiring a home run that wasn\u2019t. This time, Acu\u00f1a could catch flak for a home run that was.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Ronald Acu\u00f1a watched a highlight turn into a lowlight during Braves-Phillies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/l63O_WpDIFqJ8A0uBgpy2g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UdXdzQcVtqx37EycD5dWIQ--~B/aD0xNjg3O3c9MjUzMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/45f202e0-d43e-11e9-8bd5-1d503b43e42a", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
