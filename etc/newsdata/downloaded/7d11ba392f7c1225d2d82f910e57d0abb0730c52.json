These standards had been included in energy laws implemented under President George W. Bush and finalized during President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure, NBC News reported. In the years since, the bulb rules have become a cause for conservative media and politicians, including President Donald Trump.\n\nScheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2020, the regulations would have raised the energy efficiency requirements for many popular lightbulb types, including those used in bathroom vanities, chandeliers and recessed lighting. The standards would have led to the phasing out of incandescent and halogen bulbs used for these purposes and replaced them with fluorescent or LED versions. LED bulbs use up to 80% less electricity and last considerably longer than traditional incandescent and halogen bulbs.\n\nThe rule would have applied to about half of the approximately 6 billion lightbulbs used in the U.S., the Natural Resources Defense Council said.\n\nConsumers were predicted to save billions of dollars thanks to the new rule \u2015 and millions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions would also have been prevented, experts said.\n\nDefending the rule reversal on Wednesday, the Energy Department said the standards had been established \u201cin a manner that is not consistent with the best reading\u201d of existing law. Plus, the department said, it was returning \u201cchoice to consumers\u201d with the rollback.\n\n\u201cDifferent households have different needs, and it was both unfair and illegal to limit their options,\u201d a department spokesperson told CNBC.\n\nWhile industry groups like the National Electrical Manufacturers Association have lauded the rollback, environmentalists and climate experts warned of its potentially damaging ramifications.\n\n\u201cThe Energy Department flat out got it wrong today,\u201d Jason Hartke of the Alliance to Save Energy, a coalition of business and green groups, said in a statement. \u201cInstead of moving us forward, this rule will keep more energy-wasting bulbs on store shelves and saddle the average American household with about $100 in unnecessary energy costs every year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWasting energy with inefficient lightbulbs isn\u2019t just costly for homes and businesses, it\u2019s terrible for our climate,\u201d Hartke added.\n\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council vowed to \u201cexplore all options, including litigation\u201d to stop the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmisguided\u201d move.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action sets the United States up to become the world\u2019s dumping ground for the inefficient incandescent and halogen bulbs being phased out around the world,\u201d Noah Horowitz of the NRDC\u2019s Center for Energy Efficiency Standards told NBC. \u201cGiven the worsening climate crisis, this is no time to significantly increase pollution and consumer energy bills just so a few lighting companies can make more money selling inefficient bulbs.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: The Dept. of @Energy announced it will proceed with rolling back energy-saving standards for everyday light bulbs, leading to higher energy bills for homes and businesses, plus significantly more pollution harming our health and the environment: https://t.co/OLwaTfFhHS \u2014 NRDC \ud83c\udf0e (@NRDC) September 4, 2019\n\nAs The Hill noted, environmental groups may not be the only ones that\u2019ll take the Trump administration to court over the reversal.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) lambasted the rollback as a \u201cdim-witted move\u201d and said he was \u201cprepared\u201d to launch a challenge over it.\n\n\u201cWith all that\u2019s at stake in the world, the Trump Administration has chosen to declare war on energy-efficient light bulbs,\u201d Becerra said in a statement. \u201cThis is but another dim-witted move that will waste energy at the expense of our people and planet. We are prepared to challenge this latest Trump backsliding which seemingly has no bottom.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has tried to dismantle or weaken many regulations aimed at tackling climate change, including relaxing methane emissions standards and gutting the Clean Air Act.\n\nWith all that\u2019s at stake in the world, the Trump Administration has chosen to declare war on energy-efficient light bulbs.\n\n\n\nThis is but another dim-witted move that will waste energy at the expense of our people and planet.\n\n\n\nWe are prepared to challenge this latest backslide. https://t.co/DHZqEopgrP \u2014 Xavier Becerra (@AGBecerra) September 4, 2019", "description": "The Trump administration is rolling back energy-efficiency standards that would\u2019ve applied to about half of the lightbulbs used in the U.S.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e0b451f00002c0021d84c.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
