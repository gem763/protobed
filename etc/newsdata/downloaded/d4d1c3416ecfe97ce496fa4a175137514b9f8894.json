It's a momentous decision \u2014 but one that they still may not get resolved on this day.\n\nFirst they will vote on whether \u2014 yet again \u2014 to delay their decision on Brexit.\n\nJohnson implored legislators to ratify the deal he struck this week with the bloc's 27 other leaders. He said members of the House of Commons should \"come together as democrats to end this debilitating feud\" over Brexit, which has bitterly divided the country since British voters narrowly chose in a 2016 vote to leave the EU.\n\n\"Now is the time for this great House of Commons to come together... as I believe people at home are hoping and expecting,\" Johnson told lawmakers.\n\nBut he may not get the vote he craves.\n\nAs the session of Parliament opened, House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said he would first allow a vote on an amendment that puts the vote on the deal off until another day. Those behind the amendment say it will remove the risk that the U.K. could stumble out of the bloc without a deal on the Oct. 31 deadline \u2014 a prospect that economists say would disrupt trade and plunge the economy into recession.\n\nThe amendment makes support for the deal conditional on the legislation to implement it being passed by Parliament, something that could take several days or weeks.\n\nOne of the lawmakers behind the measure, Oliver Letwin, said it would prevent the U.K. from leaving at the end of the month \"by mistake, if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing legislation.\"\n\nIt would also give lawmakers another chance to scrutinize \u2014 and possibly change\u2014 the Brexit departure terms while the legislation is passing through Parliament.\n\nIf this amendment passes, Johnson will have to ask the EU for a delay to Britain's departure date. Last month Parliament passed a law compelling the government to do that if no deal is approved by Saturday.\n\nThe prime minister signaled that he would do that, but under duress. He is compelled by law to ask for the extension, but he said \"it cannot change my judgment that further delay is pointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust.\"\n\nAnd he warned Saturday that the bloc's approval could not be guaranteed.\n\n\"There is very little appetite among our friends in the EU for this business to be protracted by one extra day,\" Johnson said. \"They have had three and a half years of this debate.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron made the same point a day earlier in Brussels, when he was asked whether he would support an extension to the deadline in case British lawmakers rejected Johnson's Brexit proposal.\n\n\"I want us to finish this off and speak about the future,\" Macron said. \"The Oct. 31 date must be respected. I don't believe new delays should be granted.\"\n\nThe EU's budget commissioner, Guenther Oettinger, was quoted Saturday as telling Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper that if British lawmakers reject Johnson's deal, the U.K. is likely to crash out of the bloc with no deal.\n\nBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay urged lawmakers to reject the amendment.\n\n\"It would cause further delay when our constituents and our businesses want an end to uncertainty and are calling for us to get this done,\" he said.\n\nIf the amendment passes, Britain could still leave the EU on Oct. 31, if Parliament approves the legislation \u2014 the Withdrawal Agreement Bill \u2014 in time. The government plans to introduce the bill early next week and could hold late-night sittings of Parliament in hope of getting it passed within days.\n\nAs lawmakers gathered inside Parliament \u2014 their first Saturday sitting since the 1982 Falklands War \u2014 tens of thousands of anti-Brexit demonstrators gathered in London for a march on the building, demanding a new referendum on whether Britain should leave the EU or remain.\n\n\"I fervently believe that we should remain in the EU,\" said Bruce Nicole, an Anglican vicar from Camberley, south of London, who attended the protest. \"I am British but I am also European. I don't believe the current deal offers any benefits at all.\"\n\nSince striking a deal with the EU on Thursday, Johnson has been both imploring and arm-twisting Conservative and opposition lawmakers alike as he tries to win majority support for his deal.", "description": "In their first weekend session in 37 years, British lawmakers in Parliament debated whether to accept Prime Minister Boris Johnson's proposed new divorce deal with the European Union.
