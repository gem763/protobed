(AP) - Mason Crosby won his competition to remain the Green Bay Packers\u2019 kicker.\n\nHis wife beat a more formidable challenger.\n\nMolly Crosby, a 32-year-old mother of five, had been dealing with bouts of coughing and congestion all summer. Some preliminary exams in Green Bay showed a spot on her right lung. That led the Crosbys to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for additional tests. A carcinoid endocrine tumor was found. The tumor isn\u2019t as dangerous as other forms of cancer but was disconcerting for an otherwise healthy, nonsmoker.\n\n\u201cWe found out the day before we reported to camp,\u201d Crosby said on Wednesday. \u201cWe were at Mayo the two or three days leading up to training camp, when they did all their scans and got the final prognosis.\u201d\n\nCrosby flew back to Green Bay for the start of training camp. After a subpar 2018 season, Crosby had to beat out Sam Ficken.\n\nCrosby managed to keep his focus and retained the job for a 13th season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve trained a long time in compartmentalizing different situations,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cWhenever I was home, I was fully home. The organization was unbelievable through training camp, just giving me time to be with Molly and be with the family and help where I could throughout the day and evening. I just tried to be fully in on both things. I have felt a lot of freedom in this.\n\n\u201cI love doing what I\u2019m doing but the importance of taking care of family and being there for Molly and the kids, when I look back on it, it was a special camp. I was able to really fully immerse in both things. It was nerve-wracking, too. Day in and day out, it was coming in, having to work and compete at a high level, and then going home and flowing back into a normal routine. Then, we\u2019d sit down at night and you\u2019d remember that surgery was coming and Molly had cancer. Those things were heavy.\u201d\n\nThat surgery was at the end of the preseason, with part of Molly\u2019s right lung removed. While she will go back to Mayo for a scan in mid-October, Crosby said the doctors are positive they got rid of the tumor and she will not require radiation or chemotherapy.\n\nSince 2009, the NFL has held its annual \u201cCrucial Catch\u201d campaign to raise money for the American Cancer Society. It was a campaign that had already hit home for Crosby. A grandmother died of breast cancer and a sister-in-law is in her third year battling ovarian cancer. Now with his wife\u2019s diagnosis, the fight against cancer has grown more meaningful.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s about is early detection,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting routine checkups. Don\u2019t take it for granted. The numbers, with our technology, are amazing with prevention but treating it if you catch it early enough. That\u2019s one of the big things is pushing that. Let\u2019s try to get earlier detection so we can fight this thing.\n\n\u201cWith Molly\u2019s cancer, it\u2019s always been really important to me but I\u2019m going to continue to push the charge forward and make sure that everybody gets the care. We feel so fortunate with the care that we got. Hopefully, everybody gets the same care and the same prognosis that we got.\u201d\n\nThe Packers (3-1) will play at the Dallas Cowboys (3-1) on Sunday. Some of Crosby\u2019s finest professional moments have happened at AT&T; Stadium. In the 2010 season, the Packers won the Super Bowl in Arlington. A playoff game in the 2016 season against the Cowboys marked the highlight of his career. His 56-yard field goal with 1:33 to play gave the Packers a 31-28 lead. Dallas tied the score, but Crosby booted a 51-yarder on the final play for a 34-31 victory.\n\n\u201cThe two minutes in that game were the most exciting two minutes I think I\u2019ve ever had in a game,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be able to execute it twice in that situation was awesome.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mason Crosby won his competition to remain the Green Bay Packers\u2019 kicker.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
