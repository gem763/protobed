Scotland Yard asked Interpol and the FBI to check on highly placed sources in the art world in case the painting was being auctioned on the black market.\n\nIn the picture: Jim Broadbent (pictured left) takes on the role of thief Kempton Bunton alongisde Helen Mirren. Bunton allegedly stole the Francisco Goya's painting Portrait of the Duke of Wellington from the National Gallery in London in 1961\n\nA \u00a35,000 reward was offered and the hue and cry continued until an anonymous letter was sent to a newspaper, demanding that \u00a3140,000 (the painting\u2019s worth at the time) be donated to charity. Further correspondence was sent to the Daily Mirror declaring: \u2018The Duke is safe, his temperature cared for, his future uncertain.\u2019\n\nThe theft even featured in the first 007 film, Dr. No. The Bond baddie had the portrait of Wellington propped on an easel in his lair. Sean Connery walked in, glanced at it, and muttered: \u2018So there it is.\u2019\n\nUnfortunately, back in the real world, the authorities had no idea where the national treasure was. Not, that is, until June 1965, when a letter arrived at the Mirror, along with a left luggage ticket for Birmingham New Street station. The Goya canvas was found there, rolled up inside a locked box.\n\nBut who had taken it remained a mystery until Kempton Bunton, a 61-year-old retired Geordie bus driver who lived with his wife May, a cleaning woman, and their children in a council house in Newcastle upon Tyne, gave himself up.\n\nBunton hid the painting (pictured) in the back of a wardrobe and later told police that he had stolen the picture to protest against pensioners having to shell out for a television licence\n\nHe had hidden Wellington\u2019s portrait in the back of a wardrobe. He hadn\u2019t confided in his wife because \u2018otherwise the world would have known\u2019. When he did finally reveal it, she gave the Goya a good spray of Mr Sheen and a wipe because she didn\u2019t want it to be returned dusty.\n\nBunton told police he had stolen the painting to protest against pensioners having to shell out for a television licence. He\u2019d noticed that the Goya had been partially acquired through state and private funding, and felt the money could have been better used to help pensioners.\n\nThe assistant keeper of the National Gallery (pictured left) and Bunton (right) appeared outside Bow Street's Magistrates Court on August 11, 1965\n\nConfidential files from the director of public prosecutions, released via the National Archives in 2012, added another layer to the mystery, but I haven\u2019t space to give the whole story away.\n\nIt is out there, if you\u2019re curious. Or you might want to wait until director Roger Michell \u2014 whose films include Notting Hill and the upcoming Blackbird with Kate Winslet and Susan Sarandon (showing at the BFI London Film Festival this Sunday) \u2014 has made the movie.\n\nProduction hasn\u2019t started yet but it\u2019s about to be green-lit by Pathe UK.\n\nMichell has told friends he wants the film to have the raw, working-class grittiness and humour of British New Wave movies that came out in the Sixties, such as A Taste Of Honey.\n\nHelen Mirren is to star in the upcoming production which focuses on the scandal which rocked the nation. A \u00a35,000 reward was offered and the hue and cry continued until an anonymous letter was sent to a newspaper, demanding that \u00a3140,000 (the painting\u2019s worth at the time) be donated to charity for the artwork's return\n\nIt's the A-list mafia!\n\nThere\u2019s no stopping them! Martin Scorsese is pictured surrounded by Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro \u2014 the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of heavy mobs. The veteran stars populate Scorsese\u2019s epic film The Irishman. It\u2019s about a truck driver turned \u2018helper\u2019 by the name of Frank Sheeran; and how he came to do favours for friends. \u2018I hear you paint houses,\u2019 is a phrase mentioned in the movie. Sheeran adds that he does carpentry, too. And he wasn\u2019t talking about painting and decorating. The heavy mob: Pesci, Pacino, Scorsese, Keitel and De Niro make a sleek ensemble. Their film The Irishman will close the BFI London Film Festivalon October 13 Sheeran\u2019s friends are mobsters and union bosses. He tosses so many used guns from a particular bridge into a river that he quips if the water was ever dredged, there\u2019d be enough weapons for a small army. The Irishman is about the continuing development of America, a country forged by blood and bullets. But it\u2019s also about a man looking back over his long life with regret. There\u2019s love involved, too \u2014 love of family. And it\u2019s love denied that stings Sheeran, in the end. There\u2019s been a lot written about the de-aging process used to make De Niro and others look younger. It might bother you...for five minutes...but the storytelling is so compelling that after that, the process doesn\u2019t register. I sat on the edge of my seat for the swiftest three-and-a-half hours I\u2019ve spent at the movies. The film\u2019s closing the BFI London Film Festival on October 13. Netflix will distribute it for a cinema run across the country, before streaming it from November 27.\n\nWatch out for...\n\nChristian Bale (pictured holding a trophy) gives one of his best performances in Le Mans '66 which focuses on British-born racing car driver and mechanic Ken Miles\n\nChristian Bale (right), who gives one of the best performances of his career as British-born racing car driver and mechanic Ken Miles, in James Mangold\u2019s riveting movie Le Mans \u201966 (Ford v Ferrari in the U.S.). Bale stars with Matt Damon, as designer and driver Carroll Shelby, and together they battle the corporate chicanery at Ford to burn up the track . . . and defeat the Ferrari team at Le Mans. It\u2019s a great story about friendship. Caitriona Balfe and Tracy Letts also star in the picture that\u2019s screening at the BFI London Film Festival next Thursday and Friday (October 10 and 11). I\u2019ve seen it twice and am raring to see it again.\n\nScarlett Johansson, Adam Driver, Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta, who are on magnificent form in Noah Baumbach\u2019s brilliant Marriage Story, a Netflix gem which has five screenings at the BFI Film Festival, starting this Sunday at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square.\n\nMorfydd Clark and Jennifer Ehle, who are both terrific in Rose Glass\u2019s psychological stunner Saint Maud, which screens at the BFI London Film Festival over the weekend and on Sunday.

But he said director Robert Hastie didn\u2019t want his actors \u2018walking around doing impressions of certain political figures\u2019.\n\nHowever, Hastie does want the play to be bloody. \u2018Rob wants the battles to be visceral,\u2019 the actor said. \u2018We talk, through the entire play, about how brilliant a fighter and combatant he [Coriolanus] is. So if you shy away from that, because you\u2019re afraid of shocking people, then I think you\u2019re doing the play a disservice.\u2019\n\nThe play will run at the Crucible in Sheffield from March 6 next year.\n\nHe dons a simply elegant blazer with a grand-dad shirt while attending Wimbledon Tennis\n\nBateman has a wide-ranging portfolio of works including Da Vinci's Demons (pictured left) and makes appearances at fashion shows (pictured right).
