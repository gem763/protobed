The September debate was filled with more swipes at one another, but the Democratic debate Tuesday night once again showed how insane this party has become. One could see why impeachment is on the minds of Democrats; it may be the only way to beat Trump in 2020. Trump has an agenda of fewer regulations, tax cuts, a booming economy, over three million new jobs, bigger paychecks, and record unemployment across the board. The Democrats want to increase taxes, wreck capitalism, torch the economy, confiscate guns, give illegal aliens health care, and cannibalize private health insurance. On the latter, it\u2019s the only way for Medicare for All to work.\n\nThe top of the 2020 crop is a democratic socialist who just had a heart attack, a fake Indian who can\u2019t answer the simple question about whether her health care plan will jack up middle-class taxes, and a former vice president who is beyond incoherent. They\u2019re also all very, very old. It\u2019s like Night of the Living Dead. Of course, Warren\u2019s health care plan would increase taxes. Everyone\u2019s taxes will go up and she knows that. Hence, her prevarication on the subject. And Warren was treated like the frontrunner Tuesday night. It did not go well; she was raked over the coals for her vague health care remarks. Biden didn\u2019t fare much better and he\u2019s emerging as one of the weakest frontrunners to run for the presidency in recent memory. There\u2019s a reason why he never reached such status in past presidential bids; he\u2019s just not that good. And 85 percent of the reason why he was atop of the polls was due to name recognition. After his serial gaffes on the trail, I think there are a lot of Democratic voters having second thoughts. Yet, Mike Rowe, the former host of the popular show Dirty Jobs and narrator for Discovery\u2019s Deadliest Catch, had the most brutal observation about that night.\n\nThe entire field talked about the rich, also known as the job-creating and investing class, as some boogeyman, working hard to screw over working-class America. Funny\u2014the Democratic agenda would do just that, but I digress. Everyone on stage is rich or pretty damn comfortable. So, in all, it was a debate where millionaires were fighting over who hates\u2026other rich the most. The Washington Times has more:\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican \u201ceveryman\u201d Mike Rowe says Democrats sometimes came across as millionaire candidates arguing over who \u201chates the millionaires the most\u201d during Tuesday\u2019s primary debate. The author, celebrity, and man behind Work Ethic Scholarships given out each year by the mikeroweWORKS Foundation told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that some of the ideas presented in Ohio among presidential hopefuls play to humanity\u2019s worst instincts. [\u2026] \u201cIt\u2019s a free country. Float \u2018em. Fly \u2018em,\u201d he said of Sen. Bernard Sanders\u2019 plan to tax the 400 richest Americans at a 97% rate. \u201cRun \u2018em up the old flagpole. See who salutes. Look, in the end you\u2019ve got millionaires arguing with millionaires over who hates the millionaires the most.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s just amazing that liberal America actually thinks their ideas are popular. Decriminalizing border crossings are not popular, and neither is letting MS-13 roam free thanks for sanctuary city policies. But yeah, this limousine liberal observation was spot on\u2014and it has been true for quite some time. Voters may not like Trump, but we\u2019re seeing a rather explicit distinction among the two sides. We have a future that encourages freedom and another that seeks to turn the authoritarian progressive project into a reality. Freedom vs. slavery\u2026I wonder who would win that contest.", "description": ".10/17/2019 21:00:36PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/190/c5905b3d-5f2e-4e4e-98f4-c8b7426cb877.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
