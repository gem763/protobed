(Photo by Alexander Hassenstein, Getty Images)\n\nThe RBA has admitted its June and July rate cuts didn\u2019t achieve much at all in its latest October meeting minutes.\n\nFollowing the cuts, household spending didn\u2019t pick up, the RBA noted, making the admission that its principal tool might not be so effective to get the economy going.\n\nDespite that, the minutes clearly indicated the RBA would continue to cut as the economy weakens, with expectations high the next cut will come in February.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is in one hell of a tricky position. It knows well enough that it can\u2019t get the economy going by itself but it\u2019s not going to wave the white flag either.\n\nIt admitted as much at its October meeting, the minutes of which were released on Tuesday, with board members conceding the economy hadn\u2019t improved significantly in the months following its June and July cuts.\n\n\u201c[Board] members noted that there had not yet been evidence of a pick-up in household spending following the recent reductions in the cash rate and receipt of the tax offset payments, although they acknowledged that it may be too early to expect any signs of a pick-up,\u201d it said.\n\nThat\u2019s an effective failure for the RBA which has been endeavouring to get Australians employed, earning more and spending all at once. While there are a whole host of new jobs being created, they are more than being gobbled up by a record-high proportion of Australians looking for work. That, in turn, has kept wages stagnate and spending down, and the economy looking precarious accordingly.\n\nIn short, the RBA has managed to achieve none of its stated aims \u2014 but not through lack of trying. It has decided to cut rates in three of its last five meetings \u2014 its principal lever to achieve economic growth. The official cash rate sits now at 0.75%, its lowest level in Australia\u2019s history.\n\nBut rather than stimulating the economy, there\u2019s some suggestion that they\u2019re scaring Australians instead.\n\nThe RBA certainly notes \u201cthe possibility that [cuts] might be less effective than past experience suggests.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to mention the risk of inflating house prices as borrowing becomes cheaper, although the RBA believes the recent drop in prices, and reluctance among banks to lend limits the risk somewhat.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, members assessed that close monitoring of this risk was warranted,\u201d the RBA said.\n\nThat may also be offset by the fact that the banks are only passing on partial cuts, limiting the stimulus provided to both the housing market as well as the economy. It also may be enough to see the RBA continue cutting. It is after all expected to slash the interest rate to 0.5% by early next year.\n\nBut it\u2019s running out of moves. The government has refused to spend, and the RBA itself is really only left with unconventional tools like negative interest rates and quantitative easing (QE) \u2014 both of which it is reluctant to use.\n\n\u201cAt that point we take the view that lowering the cash rate below 0.5% would involve a suite of additional measures. The most likely candidates are forward guidance and some form of quantitative easing,\u201d CBA senior economist Belinda Allen said in a note issued to Business Insider Australia.\n\n\u201c[But] what would reduce the need for unconventional monetary policy stimulus is conventional fiscal policy. There are some tentative signs of willingness to ease fiscal policy in the mid\u2011year budget review \u2014 due December.\u201d\n\nThe government however has given no indication thus far it will do so, which leaves the RBA on the hook to Australian unemployment level.\n\n\u201cThe Board would continue to monitor developments, including in the labour market, and was prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, full employment and the achievement of the inflation target over time,\u201d the RBA said.\n\nWithout an uptick, however, in the economy, which looks like it will all but elude the central bank, it will have no choice. That\u2019s why it cut in October, and that\u2019s why it will no doubt cut again, despite it not working and despite the risks.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
