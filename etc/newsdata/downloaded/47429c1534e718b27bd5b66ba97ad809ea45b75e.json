She says she owes her success to her late grandmother, Betty, who not only taught Louise to read, but also inspired the main character in her novel.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t have the best time when I was at school,\u2019 says Louise. \u2018Academically I did well, but socially it was difficult for me, so books were a form of escape.\n\nLouise Morrish, 45, (pictured) from Hampshire, revealed the inspiration behind her novel that won her the Daily Mail First Novel Competition\n\n\u2018I\u2019m very lucky because at the school where I now work, reading time is built into the curriculum. Our library is designed to be a relaxing space to give you a break from social media. You can sink into a beanbag with a book and forget screens.\u2019\n\nLouise wins a \u00a320,000 advance, a publishing contract with Penguin Random House and the services of leading literary agent Luigi Bonomi.\n\nHer novel, The Coffin Club, is a wonderfully complex story about wartime memories, ghosts, old age, ambition, secrets and murder.\n\nIt follows the story of Betty Shepherd, 110, and her carer, Tally, as the secrets of Betty\u2019s past catch up with her and the other members of the Coffin Club, a group where everyone is over 100 years old.\n\nLouise says: \u2018The inspiration came partly from my mum, who told me about a club in New Zealand where people got together to talk about death and make plans for their funerals \u2014 including designing their own coffins.\n\n\u2018But my grandmother also played a part in this book. She lived through two world wars \u2014 I was doing some research into the period she talked about and discovered lots of incredible stories about the Special Operations Executive, a secret organisation that operated in World War II.\n\n\u2018I started to think my centenarian could have a secret past in the SOE that she had never told anyone about. That\u2019s why I named my main character Betty Shepherd, after my grandmother. \u2019\n\nMother-of-three Louise (pictured) who has been writing for 20 years, revealed she hopes to use her \u00a320,000 prize to help her eldest son at medical school\n\nLouise is married to Darren, an English teacher and songwriter, and they have three children: Andrew, 19, and 16-year-old twins Ellen and William.\n\nLouise squeezes her writing in to what little time she has left between work and her sports routine, which includes endurance running, kickboxing and touch rugby.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been writing for 20 years, but more seriously for the past ten,\u2019 she says. \u2018I signed up for an online writers\u2019 course with the Faber Academy and that was a big step.\n\n\u2018The group all made comments and suggestions. It makes you feel quite vulnerable, but it is incredible how supportive everyone was and how helpful I found it. I am so thrilled to have won this competition, but I have no illusions about how hard it is to make a proper living out of writing. I know I\u2019ll keep working part-time at my job, which I absolutely love.\u2019\n\nAnd as for that \u00a320,000 prize? Louise\u2019s eldest son, Andrew, is in his second year of medical school in London, which is very expensive, so she\u2019s hoping to help him out.\n\nAnd the family has always longed to see the Northern Lights.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been on my bucket list, so now perhaps we could all go.\u2019\n\nWINNER THE COFFIN CLUB by Louise Morrish A sallow moon shines like a jaundiced eye through the bedroom window. Watching her. Sleep will be elusive tonight, Betty knows. Always the way when it\u2019s a full moon. She really ought to close the curtains, but it would make no difference. The moon will still be there, whether she can see it or not; a monthly reminder. As if she could ever forget. From the bedroom next door, she can hear Tally\u2019s rumbling snores. Her carer would have slept through the Blitz, Betty has no doubt. Lucky girl. Sighing, she hoists herself up in the bed, reaches for her glasses on the night stand. Yesterday\u2019s paper lies folded next to them, half read. She\u2019ll try the cryptic, see if that\u2019ll send her off. The moon\u2019s light is enough to see by, if she squints. She rummages in the pockets of her bedjacket. But instead of the pencil she expects to find, she unearths a balled Kleenex, a rusty hat-pin, and a key whose lock she cannot recall. She wipes at her eyes with the crusty tissue, peers at the key, turning it over in her wrinkled palm. It is an odd shape, with too many protrusions. How had it come to be in her pocket? She turns the key over and over, her brain grinding with the effort of remembering. An image flickers in the recesses of her memory and she thinks she has it, but no. She tries again, groping in the dark, her mind tripping and stumbling over memories long forgotten, terrified of the empty spaces she can sense, but not see. The dog emits a soft growl. \u2018What is it boy?\u2019 Betty pushes herself further up the pillows, and as she does so a vaguely familiar, smoke-hoarse voice comes clear to her across the years. \u2018A skeleton key\u2019ll open almost anyfing.\u2019 A movement snags her eyes; there, in the far corner of the bedroom, almost invisible in the shadows, stands a figure. As the person slowly approaches, Betty\u2019s fingers instinctively tighten around the key. She knuckles her glasses further up her nose, trying to bring the man into focus. He is almost at the bed when recognition pierces the blackness of her memory like a lighthouse beam; it is a man she knows only as \u2018Mr Smith the lock-picker\u2019. Betty\u2019s heart stutters. Is she hallucinating? She hasn\u2019t seen her security instructor \u2018Mr Smith\u2019 since 1943. Yet here he is, looking exactly the same as he did back then, face narrow as a ferret\u2019s, greasy haired, wearing the same threadbare brown suit. There is a sudden waft of Woodbines, a smell that takes Betty straight back to Wanborough Manor, Special Training School No 5.\n\nLiterary agent Luigi Bonomi, says she fell in love with Louise's (pictured) character Betty, the moment that she first read about her\n\nAND OUR FIVE RUNNERS-UP Congratulations to our five highly commended runners-up\u2026 SIGHTLINE by Marie Challoner from Cambridgeshire A ten-year-old girl obsessed with insects and body farms discovers the corpse of a missing teenage boy and decides to follow the police investigation in this dark thriller.

The sudden appearance of her former security instructor is as entertaining as it is unexpected, and there are delicious undercurrents of secrecy and menace.", "description": "Louise Morrish, 45, from Hampshire, has been selected as the winner of the\u00a0Daily Mail First Novel Competition.
