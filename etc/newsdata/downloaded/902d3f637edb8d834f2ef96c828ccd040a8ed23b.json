Monday's decision means the U.K. cannot now exit the European Union with no agreement legally in place on October 31 \u2014 the deadline set by the previous extension \u2014 something the EU27 and many in the U.K. were keen to avoid.\n\nAmbassadors took the decision in just 15 minutes on Monday morning after France signaled overnight it was removing its objection to an extension. The change in position happened over the weekend after French President Emmanuel Macron had a phone conversation with Johnson on Sunday afternoon and after further conversations between the EU27 and the U.K., according to an official close to the French president.\n\nAll the legal documents setting out the terms of the extension were approved without amendment by the ambassadors. They state that the extension is conditional on the U.K. not acting to \u201cjeopardize\u201d the EU\u2019s objectives and decision-making process. It also states that the extension cannot be used for further negotiations on the Brexit deal \u2014 although the terms of a previous extension contained an identical \"no renegotiation\" clause yet the EU allowed the Withdrawal Agreement to be reopened and substantial changes were made.\n\nJohnson is compelled to accept the extension by the Benn Act, which was passed by the U.K. parliament in September\n\nDuring the extension period, the U.K. will have to appoint a European commissioner as it \"will remain a member state until the new withdrawal date, with full rights and obligations,\" the text states, according to a copy seen by POLITICO.\n\nOne diplomat in the room said the meeting was a \"rubber stamping\" exercise, while another said the discussion was \"smooth.\" But EU negotiator Michel Barnier, who briefed ambassadors at the meeting, said there was still a \"great lack of certainty\" about the internal political situation in the U.K. He added that this lack of visibility leaves open any scenario on timeframe, according to another diplomat present.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk tweeted after the meeting was over: \"The EU27 has agreed that it will accept the U.K.'s request for a #Brexit flextension until 31 January 2020. The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure.\"\n\n\u201cThe PM has not yet seen the EU\u2019s response to parliament\u2019s request for a delay and the PM will respond once he has seen the detail.\u201d\n\nJohnson is compelled to accept the extension by the Benn Act, which was passed by the U.K. parliament in September and is designed to avoid a no-deal crash out from the EU. It states that, \"the prime minister must, immediately after such a decision is made, notify the president of the European council that the United Kingdom agrees to the proposed extension.\"\n\nThe prime minister's spokesperson told journalists at a regular briefing: \u201c[Johnson's] view has not changed, parliament should not have put the U.K. in this position and we should be leaving on October 31. The prime minister secured a great new deal despite being told it was impossible, but parliament has chosen more dither and delay.\u201d\n\nThe EU27 has agreed that it will accept the UK's request for a #Brexit flextension until 31 January 2020. The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure. \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) October 28, 2019\n\nA spokesperson for the Labour party said: \u201cBoris Johnson has spent months promising that we would leave the EU on 31st October. The failure to do so is his alone.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of the extension, the U.K. can leave the EU earlier than the final end date on December 1 or January 1 if ratification in the UK and European parliaments has been achieved by one of those dates.\n\nThis story has been updated with reaction from the U.K.", "description": "Ambassadors meeting in Brussels took the decision in just 15 minutes.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "James Randerson", "Rym Momtaz"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1181847843-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
