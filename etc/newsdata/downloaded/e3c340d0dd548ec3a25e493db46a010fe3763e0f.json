Government data also showed declining water pressure and falling wind speeds over the 1980-2018 period.\n\nGlobally from 1960 to 2018, the last four years saw the highest average annual sea water temperatures, and average water levels last year were the highest ever recorded, the study said.\n\nIt said China\u2019s densely populated and environmentally fragile coastal regions were particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and temperatures.\n\n\u201cIn the context of climate change, rising sea temperatures and sea levels as well as extreme weather events like typhoons, giant tidal waves and storm surges will have a relatively big impact on the environment, society and economy of our coastal regions,\u201d it said.\n\nChina has seen record temperatures and rainfall in a number of regions this year, and its meteorological bureau warned that it was facing more extreme weather as a result of climate change.\n\nMany cities on China\u2019s eastern coast have already drawn up contingency plans, with the financial hub of Shanghai looking into building new drainage tunnels and tidal gates to cope with rising sea levels.", "description": "Coastal sea levels around China were 48 millimetres higher last year than the 1993-2011 average, with winter ice floes shrinking and temperatures on the rise, the Ministry of Natural Resources said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
