Just before polling day, the then opposition leader flagged that a Labor government would change workplace laws to let unions and employers negotiate extended greenfields agreements covering the full construction phase of new resource and infrastructure projects. Recognising how big, job-creating projects must compete for domestic and foreign capital \u2013 and keen to reassure business in the face of the ACTU\u2019s class-ridden \u2018Change the Rules\u2019 campaign \u2013 Mr Shorten said that lifetime project industrial agreements would create the certainty needed to attract the \u201cglobal investors who back it\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ll be good paying jobs,\u201d he rightly said.\n\nExtended greenfield agreements will greenlight more major construction projects. Ryan Stuart\n\nThe Morrison government has now pledged to proceed with legislation to amend the Fair Work Act and remove the provisions restricting greenfields agreements to a maximum four-year period. Why on earth not? Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter rightly says this would foster greater certainty around investment decisions, help secure finance, and create more jobs. The current time limit creates uncertainty about labour costs, and can deter investors from financing major projects with longer lifespans, which may not therefore go ahead. Greenfield agreements that expire mid-project risk cost blowouts and \u201cprotected\u201d strikes as unions do what the system invites them to do: to legally exploit their monopoly power over the supply of labour to extort rents from capital-intensive resource or infrastructure projects.\n\nMr Shorten\u2019s sensible proposal to match industrial agreements with project time-frames will make it hard for Labor to not support the government\u2019s commonsense changes. Yet opposition workplace relations spokesman Tony Burke says Labor won\u2019t commit until it sees the details. Militant union dinosaurs such as the CFMEU stuck in a zero-sum labour-v-capital business model are pressuring Labor to reject any changes. Like the free trade agreements, this is an opportunity for Labor leader Anthony Albanese to show that his post-election talk about Labor rediscovering a pro-investment, pro-jobs, pro-growth Hawke-Keating style economic agenda is more than talk.\n\nThis is an example of Scott Morrison\u2019s dictate that reforms to Australia\u2019s workplace regulation must be evidence-based rather than ideological, must strengthen the economy and protect workers\u2019 rights. In other words, they must not conjure up the ghost of the Howard government\u2019s Work Choices and frighten any 'quiet Australian' voters. But more than incremental change is needed to the labyrinth complexities and rigidities of Australia\u2019s adversarial industrial relations framework. Australian companies and their workers need to be freed to invest in the high-wage, high-performance and globally competitive workplaces of the future. The government needs to change the whole narrative on this.", "description": "Labor should follow Shorten on greenfields agreements.
