Still, he gave the next start to Samsonov, who posted an impressive win against Toronto. But Reirden right back to Holtbylast Friday against the New York Rangers, and the team\u2019s top goaltender hasn\u2019t been in doubt since.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHoltby\u2019s three-game win streak ended with the Capitals\u2019 4-3 overtime loss against the Edmonton Oilers on Thursday, but captain Alex Ovechkin called Holtby the best player on the ice. With stunning precision and quick-twitch movement, Holtby had to earn nearly every one of his 36 saves against a dangerous young offensive duo in Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl.\n\n\u201c[Holtby] kept us in the game with saves on a number of odd-man rushes,\u201d Reirden sad. \u201cTo me, those are read-based and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve got to continue to work on.\u201d\n\nHoltby has faced adversity and slumps in the past, and he has learned from each. After his struggles against Colorado, Holtby said he needed to \u201ctake a deep breath and go out and play,\u201d and that \u201cin a couple months, you won\u2019t remember this conversation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEighty-two games is a long time, and especially at the start of the season, things get magnified a little bit more than if that same stretch happened in January,\u201d Holtby said. \u201cIt probably wouldn\u2019t even be a conversation; no one would talk about it. You learn from experience that way, that part of staying on the same level of not getting too high or too low is recognizing a situation for what it is and keep on grinding away.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday night, Holtby made a series of stellar stops against McDavid, who got behind the Capitals defense repeatedly in the third period. McDavid\u2019s skill was particularly evident on an eye-popping one-on-one move past Nick Jensen six minutes into the third period, and his shot hit off the crossbar. Jensen did not reenter the game until almost five minutes left in the third period, during which he took just three shifts.\n\n\u201cI think that there was a number of bad reads and you have to hold players accountable and have them miss a shift or two to help them understand and learn lessons and we will continue to do that and try to improve so this can stop occurring and we can stop letting teams back in the game,\u201d Reirden said\n\nAD\n\nHoltby faced 14 shots in both the second and third periods, with the latter proving to be the most challenging. Holtby held the Oilers scoreless in the second period, but McDavid, who recorded zero shot attempts through the first 40 minutes, came alive in the third. McDavid, who fhad been held without a point in his previous three games, finished with a goal and two assists\n\nAD\n\nHoltby faced odd-man rushes on both of Draistl\u2019s goals, which ultimately proved to be the difference. Samsonov was scheduled to start Friday night in Vancouver, but the team remains clear on the current hierarchy in goal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been worried about [Holtby], and I certainly was not worried about him this year like I\u2019ve heard some rumblings about,\u201d defenseman John Carlson said. \u201cHe\u2019s kept us in games his whole career.\u201d\n\nMore on the Capitals:\n\nAD", "description": "Captain Alex Ovechkin called Holtby the best player on the ice in the team's 4-3 overtime loss against Edmonton on Thursday.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/r_pk0dD_T50af220n9T0V4f0Zbo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MHDK6AHSUQI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
