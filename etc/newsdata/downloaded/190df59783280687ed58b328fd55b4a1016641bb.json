The Navy recently formed an experimental \u201cSurface Development Squadron\u201d for Zumwalt-class stealth destroyers, Littoral Combat Ships and drone vessels.\n\n\u201cThe Navy needs a platform dedicated to accomplishing for air warfare what the USS Zumwalt and the Surface Development Squadron aim to do for surface warfare,\u201d Cantwell wrote in Proceedings, the professional journal of the U.S. Naval Institute.\n\n\u201cThe planned decommissioning of the USS Nimitz \u2026 in 2025 presents an opportunity,\u201d Cantwell added. \u201cDrawing on its past, the Navy should designate the Nimitz as CVN(X) and overhaul her into an experimental carrier.\u201d\n\nWhile fleet force-planning constantly changes, at present the Navy expects to maintain at least eight and as many as a dozen large nuclear carriers, or CVNs, for the foreseeable future. The sailing branch in early 2019 awarded shipbuilders a $15-billion contract for two new Ford-class CVNs.\n\nIncreasingly, the Navy\u2019s big-deck amphibious assault ship with their Harrier and F-35B jump jets act as light carriers, complementing the larger CVNs. The Navy in its current round of force-structure analysis could decide to reduce the number of CVNs in favor of light carriers.\n\nBut carriers in any form increasingly are vulnerable to enemy anti-ship missiles. As a test ship, Nimitz could help the Navy to experiment with new systems that could allow the rest of the flattops to adapt during wartime, Cantwell wrote.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "This way, the Pentagon can test better anti-missile systems under more realistic conditions.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1K69_hTSxdQW1wPUlylTdw--~B/aD0xMDA5O3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/43b382f08e78fefd151c7465ba861b89", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
