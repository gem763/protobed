He will remain in his role as the creative director of Balenciaga, although a release shared with WWD over the weekend hinted at \u201cnew ventures\u201d as well.\n\n\u201cI started Vetements because I was bored of fashion,\u201d Gvasalia wrote in the release. He meant it seriously, but his arch tone represents the generally ironic attitude of the brand, which named itself with the French word for \u201cclothing\u201d and has been known to charge $980 for a T-shirt that says \u201cYOU FUCK\u2019N ASSHOLE.\u201d\n\nThe Georgian-born designer staged his fall 2015 show in the basement of a gay sex club in Paris with Kanye West looking on. His final show in June took place outside a McDonald\u2019s on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. He made headlines with trolls like jeans that show off your entire bare butt, sweatshirts reading \u201cI survived Swine Flu and now I\u2019m vegan,\u201d odes to Justin Bieber, shoes with lighter heels, and baseball caps that say \u201cCAP.\u201d All of them were street-style catnip. Celine Dion, in on the joke, wore the brand\u2019s Titanic hoodie to Fashion Week. Kim Kardashian wore Vetements pants to the White House. Rapper Sheck Wes wrote a single called \u201cVetements Socks.\u201d\n\nIt was Gvasalia\u2019s craftsmanship that impressed critics, however. He is credited with elevating streetwear to the level of couture and bringing brands like Juicy Couture and Carhartt along for the ride. \u201cThe look isn\u2019t polished. But it is, in its own way, refined,\u201d wrote Vogue in an early review. Cathy Horyn noted his \u201ccomplicated approach\u201d to such basic garments as a hoodie while maintaining its \u201cintegrity as a practical garment.\u201d He certainly didn\u2019t invent streetwear (and it\u2019s worth noting that his \u201cnon-model\u201d runways notably lacked diversity), but, for better or worse, he did have a hand in shifting the way the industry thought about it.\n\n\u201cAgainst all odds, fashion did change once and forever since Vetements appeared,\u201d Gvasalia humbly added in the release. \u201cAnd it also opened a new door for so many.\u201d He concluded by saying that he \u201caccomplished [his] mission of a conceptualist and design innovator.\u201d And as for the future of the brand, he wrote: \u201cVetements has matured into a company that can evolve its creative heritage into a new chapter on its own.\u201d\n\nSo, everyone is moving on, it seems. Even at Balenciaga, Gvasalia has noticeably moved away from Triple S sneakers and bold logos and toward refined tailoring over the last few seasons. Does his exit mark the closing of a door on the streetwear craze in general? Last winter, there were rumors that the brand wasn\u2019t doing so hot. (Vetements called it \u201cfake news.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThis moment signifies a new era for Vetements,\u201d Demna\u2019s brother Guram Gvasalia, who is the co-founder and chief executive officer of Vetements, told WWD. \u201cNew projects and surprise collaborations are to be revealed in the very near future,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Cut has reached out to Vetements for comment, but apparently the brand\u2019s mailbox is full.\n\nStay in touch.
