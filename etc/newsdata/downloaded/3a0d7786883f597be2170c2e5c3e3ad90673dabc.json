They will be a big threat, and I will be nervous if we play them,\" added Erasmus, whose side lost their opening match at Japan 2019 to reigning champions and arch-rivals New Zealand.\n\n\"Japan is a much bigger threat than people think they are. They smashed teams like Fiji in the Pacific Cup, and they beat Ireland (19-12) the other day.\n\n\"Scotland can still sneak in there... We'll enjoy these next two days off, watch those games and then just buckle up and prepare as well as we can.\"\n\nCanada, who came into this match on a six-day turnaround after being hammered 63-0 by the All Blacks, had to play more than half the game a man down after replacement lock Josh Larsen saw red for a shoulder charge on Springbok prop Thomas du Toit.\n\nThey have yet to win a match at Japan 2019 but will look to finish with a flourish against fellow minnows Namibia on Sunday.\n\n\"We've planned for this game for a long while,\" said Canada coach Kingsley Jones of the Namibia fixture.\n\n\"There'll be a lot of rest and recovery. I think it's going to come down to the legs of the guys on Sunday.\"\n\nAsked whether victory would mean Canada had enjoyed a successful World Cup, the former Wales backrow replied: \"It would be considered, from my point of view, very successful if we did get the win.\n\n\"But it's about performance against a team that's at a similar level to us.\"", "description": "Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus said the \"X-factor\" Cobus Reinach was a chip off the old block as the scrumhalf scored the quickest World Cup hat-trick.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9448/5a30bd1f62d84c8a8793e7ce679b4d2b.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
