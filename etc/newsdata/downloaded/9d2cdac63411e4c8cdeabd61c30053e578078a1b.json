But EOIR was overwhelmed by the sheer number of new cases, sending its backlog up to nearly 1 million cases.\n\n\u201cOur immigration courts are doing everything in their power to efficiently adjudicate immigration cases while respecting due process rights, but efficient adjudication alone cannot resolve the crisis at the border,\u201d said James McHenry, director of EOIR.\n\nThe revelations come as the administration takes stock of the just-concluded fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30.\n\nBorder captures will total nearly 1 million \u2014 but that\u2019s actually better than feared this spring, when Customs and Border Protection nabbed 144,000 people in May alone, setting records for the number of children and families.\n\nThose numbers have improved dramatically, with roughly 52,000 captures in September, officials announced this week.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said the department has made such headway that it is about to end catch-and-release of illegal immigrant families.\n\nYet the effects of the surge are tough to overstate.\n\nICE officers who usually scour prisons and jails for illegal immigrants with criminal records were pulled off duty and sent to the border where they were tasked with facilitating catch-and-release by opening doors on vans to actually release the illegal immigrants who\u2019d just been caught.\n\nWith officers distracted, ICE\u2019s arrests tumbled to about 140,000 in fiscal year 2019, Mr. Albence said.\n\nHe said 75% of those arrests came from scouring prisons and jails for illegal immigrants with criminal records. The other 25% were from the at-large teams tracking down fugitives.\n\nHe pushed back against the constraints on his agency\u2019s ability to go after those migrants in jails.\n\nIn particular, he unloaded on a federal judge who issued a ruling late last month puncturing the detainer system ICE uses to try to get local authorities to turn over illegal immigrants they encounter. Judge Andre Birotte Jr., whom President Barack Obama appointee to the bench, said the computer systems ICE uses are so unreliable that it\u2019s snaring U.S. citizens and others who shouldn\u2019t be detained.\n\n\u201cThis decision will threaten public safety as it will lead to the release of criminal aliens back onto the street,\u201d Mr. Albence said.\n\nThe acting ICE chief also blasted sanctuary jurisdictions that limit cooperation with ICE, saying they too endanger communities by releasing illegal immigrants.\n\nOne Texas sheriff who stood alongside Mr. Albence compared anti-ICE sentiment sweeping the country to the treatment aimed at returning Vietnam war veterans, saying Thursday that deportation officers are being vilified for enforcing laws Congress passed.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re eviscerating honorable people doing noble things, standing on the wall between good and evil for you and me,\u201d said Bill Waybourn, the sheriff of Tarrant County, which contains Fort Worth.\n\nICE revealed one sanctuary case this week out of Oklahoma, where the agency says the Oklahoma County Sheriff\u2019s Department defied a detainer request placed on an accused rapist, and instead released him onto the streets.\n\nHours later, ICE said, suspect Antonio Ulises Perez was back at the door of the woman he is accused of having raped.\n\nICE deportations officers were eventually able to round the suspect up and he now awaits deportation proceedings, the agency said.\n\n\u201cIt is unconscionable that someone who is sworn to uphold the law would find it acceptable to release an alleged rapist who is illegally present in the U.S. back into the community when there are other options available under federal immigration law,\u201d said Marc Moore, director of ICE\u2019s Dallas field office.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s department, in a statement, said ICE was wrong on several counts.\n\nThe department said another agency, not the sheriff\u2019s department, made the arrest. And while Mr. Perez was booked on suspicion of rape, he was never formally charged, the department said.\n\nBeyond that, the sheriff\u2019s department said it does try to cooperate with ICE, and even allows space in its jail for agents. The department said ICE didn\u2019t have a warrant to justify holding Mr. Lopez for pickup, but said they did alert ICE of his impending release.\n\n\u201cICE had an hour and a half to take the individual into custody but did not send anyone to pick up the individual before his scheduled release, and, without any legal authority to hold the individual, he was released,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
