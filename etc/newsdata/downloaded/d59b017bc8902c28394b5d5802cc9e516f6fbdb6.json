It makes the best-selling protein bar in the UK. The factory also produces protein drinks, spreads and biscuits. It produces around 1 million bars per week and makes 11 different flavours of Carb Killa bars.\n\nAccording to Founder and CEO Alan Barratt, the manufacturing process is a closely guarded secret: \u201cThe machinery is pretty complicated and pretty formidable. They\u2019re made on an 80-metre line. The ingredients are all bought in in the specific quantities, weighed and measured out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last Carb Killa bar we launched was 17 months just on flavour development. Bearing in mind we already had the concept, the name, the idea, everything else in place, it was just the flavour. So to spend 17 months on flavour, we pushed it and pushed it and pushed it and we made it perfect.\u201d\n\nProduced by Andy Ash\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
