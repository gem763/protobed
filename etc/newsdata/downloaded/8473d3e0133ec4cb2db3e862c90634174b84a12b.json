A second apple trader was in a critical condition.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday security forces killed three alleged rebels near Bijbehara town, 28 miles south of the main city of Srinagar.\n\nKashmir has been under a security lockdown since 5 August when the Indian government scrapped its special status. Mobile phone services were restored for some users on Monday after a 72-day blackout but internet services remain suspended.\n\nBefore Delhi\u2019s announcement that it was to remove Kashmir\u2019s autonomy, the leader of the region\u2019s largest militant group, Hizbul Mujahideen, had warned that the move would make Indians in the territory legitimate targets.\n\nIndian officials argued that removing Kashmir\u2019s special status, which granted it its own constitution and rules protecting land ownership, would bring greater development and rid the state of terrorism.\n\nSome policy experts say the high death toll on Wednesday undermines such pledges. \u201cThe government\u2019s claims are really falling flat,\u201d said Khalid Shah, an associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation. \u201cMy sense is that the violence is only going to increase, it\u2019s not going to decrease, and to what extent, where it leaves Kashmir, is very difficult to say.\u201d\n\nAn insurgency has waxed and waned on the Indian-administered side for three decades, and tens of thousands of people have been killed. Critics say Delhi\u2019s actions have undermined the political mainstream and created fertile ground for militant groups.\n\nKashmir\u2019s most prominent political and business leaders as well as the president of bar association are all in detention. Officials said such detentions were to prevent unrest, but others warned of a dangerous power vacuum.\n\nLast weekend a spokesman for al-Qaida in Indian Subcontinent described Indian-administered Kashmir as \u201cthe worst prison\u201d and called for attacks against the Indian government and army.\n\nIn Anchar, a neighbourhood of Srinagar where residents have fought back against security forces, graffiti on the wall reads \u201cWelcome Taliban\u201d.\n\nIn an attempt to win over Kashmiris, the Indian government placed a front-page advert in one of the region\u2019s most popular newspapers, Greater Kashmir, urging people to resume normal life. \u201cClosed shops, no public transport? Who benefits? Are we going to succumb to militants? Think!\u201d, the advert said.\n\nIn Srinagar, government offices are operating but shops are open only during early morning hours and children are not attending schools. Residents told the Guardian that the refusal to open businesses was an act of defiance. Some reported that residents were complying with a shutdown because they were afraid of being targeted by militants.\n\nArshad, who lives in south Kashmir, where sympathies for militants are widespread, said he would welcome \u201cany external support\u201d that came for Kashmir\u2019s separatist struggle.\n\n\u201cWe cannot fight this war on our own, we need external support whosoever it be,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far Pakistan has pleaded our case and supported us, but even if South Sudan or China offer us help I will be the first to raise their flag here,\u201d he said.\n\nArshad, who has a postgraduate degree and who agreed to be identified by his first name only, said Delhi had restricted all scope for all political activities in the region, which would push militants to the centre stage.\n\n\u201cI think militants will now have a dual role of carrying out the armed struggle as well as taking over the role of political leadership and I feel they are already doing that,\u201d he said.", "description": "Some observers say Delhi\u2019s promises falling flat and unrest likely to increase", "authors": ["Rebecca Ratcliffe", "A Reporter In Srinagar"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fae48684903515ee8c886f321524c476731ba8c/0_0_6040_3624/master/6040.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=732693c161c28631d0ea7c1dbceda5ce", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
