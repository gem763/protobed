There\u2019s $17 trillion worth of U.S. securities out there, pension funds, savings plans, ETFs. You can\u2019t go buy that up and issue new debt at a lower price.\u201d\n\n....The USA should always be paying the the lowest rate. No Inflation! It is only the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn\u2019t allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of \u201cBoneheads.\u201d \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nAre zero interest rates the answer?\n\nIn recent years, slow economic growth has forced central banks in Europe and Japan to set negative interest rates. In that scenario, borrowers actually pay the bank to hold their money, giving people little incentive to save.\n\nHouse said Trump\u2019s tweet was most likely in response to reports that the Fed\u2019s European counterpart, the ECB, is expected to cut short-term interest rates at Thursday\u2019s policy-setting meeting to - 0.5% and implement a new round of quantitative easing to help jumpstart Europe\u2019s flailing economy.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s just trying to deflect from the real weakness in the economy, which is stemming from the trade situation,\u201d House said.\n\nZero interest rates have historically been viewed as an emergency measure usually taken to help an economy climb out of recession. Economists worry that Trump wants the Federal Reserve to take these steps when we\u2019re not in a recession, leaving the central bank few, if any, tools to combat a downturn in the future.\n\n\u201c[Trump] inherited a good economy,\u201d said Newman, \u201cand there are signs it\u2019s slowing, but he wants to basically take all the stimulus measures you would use during a recession and use them now, and we know this is just to pump up his re-election bid.\u201d\n\n\u201cInflammatory\u201d tweets\n\nKeith Fitz-Gerald, chief investment strategist at Money Map Press, told Yahoo Finance that the president\u2019s latest Fed tweets are \u201cinflammatory\u201d and \u201cprovocative.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he wants to force a discussion that the Fed and legions of traditional economists don't want to have... about why the Fed is repeatedly off the mark and why its actions have caused one crisis after another rather than solved them,\u201d he said.\n\nFitz-Gerald doesn\u2019t believe zero interest rates are a good idea, but cautions investors to think rationally if it happens.\n\n\u201cI get concerned as an investor because the march to zero forces people to take bigger risks with their money for the same or even less of a return,\u201d he said. \u201cThis makes investing in only the best companies \u2013 meaning those with real businesses, growing revenues, real profits and savvy executives \u2013 even more of a priority than ever before. The worry I have is that many investors will find out the hard way (again) that they've been speculating when they should have been investing.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d Follow her on Twitter @AlexisTVNews.\n\nRead more:\n\n'Everybody\u2019s losing the trade war': Strategist\n\nHow to trade AT&T\n\nSonos is surviving the China trade war\n\nRecession warning: RV sales hit the skids\n\nShould stocks be taking their cue from bonds?\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s latest attack on the Federal Reserve has him calling central bank officials \u201cboneheads,\u201d for not cutting interest rates to zero or lower to boost the slowing economy.Yahoo Finance\u2019s senior columnist Rick Newman says the President is the real \u201cbonehead,\u201d calling his Fed tweets \u201cignorant", "authors": ["Alexis Christoforous"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/grginDyal3j8HoSqp5iv7A--~B/aD0yMjA4O3c9MzQxMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/2b65e290-d4b4-11e9-b7ee-4a65d745d86f", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
