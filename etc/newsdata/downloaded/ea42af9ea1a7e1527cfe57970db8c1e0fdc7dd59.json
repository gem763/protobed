In what he describes as almost cartoon-like motion, it \u201czoomed up\u201d to the yellow object, stopped and reversed, then did it again \u201cas if to prompt a reaction\u201d.\n\nThe yellow object then \u201ctook off\u201d with the red object in pursuit. They zigzagged across the sky like two \u201cblowflies\u201d, changing direction instantly with no apparent inertia and covering distances he later estimated to be up to half a kilometre in less than a second.\n\nThroughout the \u201cchase\u201d, which Phil says lasted several minutes, the yellow object would periodically stop in mid-flight and shake back and forth \u201cas if caught by some invisible force\u201d before freeing itself.\n\nmedia_camera An Associated Press article from February 8, 1980, about the Stirling UFO sighting.\n\nNeither object made any noise. Eventually the yellow object sped off and disappeared behind a hill, and the red object also vanished. In total, he believes the entire sighting lasted about 15 minutes.\n\nRob Tindale confirmed his brother\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cCertainly there were two lights, one appeared to the chasing the other, they both dipped below the horizon,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was a very memorable thing.\u201d\n\nThe same night, a local farmhand, 21-year-old Daryl Browne, reported seeing a \u201cspeedboat-shaped yellow thing\u201d like a \u201chalf moon\u201d crash into some trees near the horse farm where he worked \u2014 in the exact area where the brothers last saw the object.\n\nAccording to newspaper reports, Mr Browne told police he was watching TV that night when his dogs began howling. \u201cAnd then I heard the trees smashing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI locked the kids inside and went outside with a torch.\u201d\n\nMr Browne shone the flashlight into the trees and saw the object, which was \u201cabout 25 to 30 feet long\u201d and was not emitting and sound or light. He called police but the object had disappeared by the time they arrived.\n\nAt the time, police told media only that there were unexplained broken branches and no other physical evidence. Mr Browne was interviewed by investigators from UFO Research South Australia the next day, who published a report in that month\u2019s UFO Research Australia newsletter.\n\nmedia_camera UFO Research Australia\u2019s first newsletter.\n\nmedia_camera Investigators visited the scene the next day.\n\nFor Phil, 49, the strange sighting was nothing more than a \u201ccampfire story\u201d for the next 30 years or so. It wasn\u2019t until around 2009 that he decided to investigate further, revisiting the scene of the crash and delving deep into the UFO topic.\n\nHe believes their sighting is unique, saying he has been unable to find virtually any other reports of \u201cconflict\u201d between UFOs. He says he is \u201c100 per cent\u201d convinced what he saw was extraterrestrial, and not military aircraft.\n\n\u201cOver the years I\u2019ve done lots of reading but also personal investigation, contacting people one to one. There are loads of people out there who just don\u2019t report it, don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNot everyone has a fantastically compelling sighting, often it\u2019s just lights in the sky, but there are significant numbers of sightings where there is an object that is so far beyond our capability it has to be extraterrestrial.\u201d\n\nRob said he was probably a bit more \u201cconservative\u201d than his brother about certain aspects of the UFO topic, but if he had to guess what it was they saw that night, \u201cI would tend on the extraterrestrial side\u201d.\n\n\u201cCertainly in the \u201880s and even these days, the fact that the objects made these quick, jerky motions, couldn\u2019t have happened with the technology we\u2019ve got,\u201d he said, adding that it hadn\u2019t particularly affected him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like a close encounter, it was just seeing some lights in the sky \u2014 like watching a meteorite.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera Phil Tindale believes he witnessed two UFOs as a child in 1980.\n\nInterest in the UFO subject has been revitalised in the past two years since The New York Times published a bombshell article revealing the existence of a Pentagon UFO study program. In the same article, a former high-ranking US Navy fighter pilot recounted chasing a \u201cTic Tac\u201d-shaped UFO.\n\nPhil said commander David Fravor\u2019s description of the object\u2019s movement resembled what he saw. \u201cThe instant acceleration, nothing can do that unless you\u2019ve mastered the force of gravity, not using any conventional propulsion,\u201d he said.\n\nHe says he has \u201cconsidered everything\u201d in terms of other possible explanations for what he saw but \u201cthe movements of the craft\u201d were simply impossible using \u201cany conventional propulsion\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere must be a million people like me,\u201d who have seen things but don\u2019t report them, he adds. In South Australia, at least, Phil is not alone. UFO sightings have been reported in the state since the early 20th century, but surged during the Cold War.\n\nThe most famous case was the 1988 incident with the Knowles family, who said they driving along the remote Nullarbor Plain when a large glowing object \u201clike a big ball\u201d chased them and lifted their car off the ground.\n\nPaul Curnow from the South Australia Astronomical Society said it was still common to get from several dozen to hundreds of UFO reports a year in South Australia.\n\n\u201cProbably for every 10 cases you get, nine can be explained in mundane terms,\u201d Mr Curnow told the ABC last year. \u201cQuite often people report a little silver dot in the sky (and it) turned out to be an aircraft. A lot of these things like planes, satellites, planets, even searchlights sometimes, can all add to what people are reporting.\u201d\n\nfrank.chung@news.com.au\n\nOriginally published as Day two Hills brothers \u2018witnessed UFO air battle\u2019", "description": "Nearly 40 years ago, Phil Tindale was standing in his Adelaide Hills home when he says he saw what can only be described as an air battle between two UFOs \u2014 which ended with one crashing to earth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/885e37a23e771fa08724a91721aecf0b", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
