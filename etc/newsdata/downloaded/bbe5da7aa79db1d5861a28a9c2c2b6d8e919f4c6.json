In spite of decades of scientific data proving human-caused climate change, we are still spellbound by a story of enlightened progress. Our high-carbon culture is underpinned by a belief system that tells us we are in control of nature and can fix any problem with our superior technology.\n\nThere are signs that this story is losing its hold. In 2017 David Wallace-Wells shocked readers of New York Magazine with an article called \u201cThe Uninhabitable Earth.\u201d In 2018 Jem Bendell , a professor of sustainability leadership at the University of Cumbria, published an academic paper discussing the need for \u201cdeep adaptation\u201d in the face of impending ecological collapse. More recently, Jonathan Franzen caused another stir in The New Yorker, declaring that in the face of the world\u2019s failure to decrease carbon emissions, \u201ca false hope of salvation can be actively harmful.\u201d\n\nSometimes, though, the story is larger than words.\n\nIn April, colored flags bearing the shapes of an hourglass, a skull, bees and butterflies began to flutter over the River Thames. In the space of an hour five bridges were closed down. Thousands of people poured into the streets and disrupted traffic in central London for 11 days, demanding immediate action from the government on the climate crisis.\n\nSix months later, mass civil disobedience returned to the streets of London and 60 cities across the world. In the course of ten days, over 1,700 protesters from Extinction Rebellio n , a protest movement that through nonviolent direct action seeks to raise the alarm on extinction and other ecological crises, were arrested in London. The police escorted a giant pink octopus puppet to Trafalgar Square. Activists participated in sit-ins at London City Airport, the BBC offices and the Billingsgate fish market. In the second week the police banned protests, but they continued anyway.", "description": "In London, activists are taking to the streets to eschew hopelessness in favor of repair.", "authors": ["Charlotte Du Cann"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/opinion/29DuCann-1/29DuCann-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
