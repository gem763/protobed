In a letter sent last Tuesday to Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, and to several committee chairs, Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, said that Trump would not comply with requests from the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, owing to his duty to \u201cpreserve the rights\u201d of future Presidents. The inquiry itself is unconstitutional, the letter charged\u2014although the Constitution expressly gives the House the right to conduct it. On Wednesday, Trump said that he would consider co\u00f6perating only \u201cif they give us our rights,\u201d echoing a tweet from the previous day, in which he said that he couldn\u2019t let a key witness, Gordon Sondland, the U. S. Ambassador to the European Union, be deposed by congressional investigators because he \u201cwould be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cRepublican\u2019s rights,\u201d the President may just be referring to himself and to his grand delusion that he has unmatched prerogatives. If he thinks that his party can simply halt all investigations into his behavior, that\u2019s wrong, too\u2014wrong even if the Republicans had a majority in the House, and even though they do have a majority in the Senate. Republicans in both chambers are entitled to shape the process. They can, of course, defend Trump, but they can also question and confront him. One of the crucial issues in the impeachment drama is whether they will do so.\n\nThey might start by objecting to a President\u2019s asking a foreign leader to investigate the family of one of his opponents. Trump has more or less bragged about doing that in a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, of Ukraine, regarding Joe Biden and the business dealings of his son Hunter. Instead, congressional Republicans have either remained silent or tried to show that it\u2019s the Democrats who are at fault. Kevin McCarthy, the House Minority Leader, said on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d that \u201cmore people in America want to investigate what Biden has done with his son than want to impeach this President.\u201d Actually, a Fox News survey last week showed that fifty-one per cent of voters think that Trump should be \u201cimpeached and removed\u201d from office. (Trump tweeted, in response, \u201cWhoever their Pollster is, they suck.\u201d)\n\nIf articles of impeachment are passed, which seems increasingly likely, it will take sixty-seven votes in the Senate to convict Trump, which means that at least twenty of the fifty-three Republicans will have to walk away from him. That number still seems distant. The Washington Post keeps a tally: as of last week, no Republican senators publicly supported impeachment, thirty-nine were unequivocally behind Trump (for example, calling the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d), and only fourteen expressed some concern about the allegations. Mitt Romney, of Utah, has been the most critical; Ben Sasse, of Nebraska, who has broken with the President before, said that some aspects of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky are \u201cterrible,\u201d but also that the House investigation is a \u201cpartisan clown show.\u201d\n\nYet, in the same week, Republicans were as openly angry with Trump as they have ever been when he announced, after a phone call with the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, that the United States would step aside as Turkey launched a military offensive in northern Syria. The move was seen by many in both parties as a betrayal of Kurdish militias that have been a valuable partner in the fight against ISIS, but have long been targeted by Turkey. Air strikes began within days of the announcement. Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, ping-ponged between saying that the Administration had \u201cshamelessly abandoned\u201d the Kurds and pledging to hold a hearing to allow Rudy Giuliani, the President\u2019s volatile lawyer, to lay out his conspiracy theories related to Ukraine. Two days later, two of Giuliani\u2019s associates were arrested on criminal charges alleging that they had tried to funnel foreign money into American election campaigns.\n\nIt\u2019s as though any dissent on matters of policy requires a greater show of loyalty on impeachment. In this, the Republicans\u2019 intended audience is not only Trump but his electoral base. Senator Mitch McConnell, who is up for re\u00eblection next year, sharply criticized Trump\u2019s decision on Syria, but also ran an online campaign ad in which he claimed that impeachment is proceeding because \u201ca left-wing mob\u201d has Pelosi in its clutches. \u201cThe way that impeachment stops\u201d is with \u201ca Senate majority, with me as majority leader,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cBut I need your help: please contribute before the deadline!\u201d\n\nTrump relies on the appearance of a united party to validate his ever more corrosive policies\u2014and his tirades\u2014with voters. If that unity falters, things could move quickly. Yet what\u2019s remarkable is that more Republican senators who are not facing re\u00eblection, or are secure in their seats, have not spoken out as a matter of principle. Some may be boxed in by positions they staked out earlier in Trump\u2019s Presidency. In the course of the Mueller investigation, many congressional Republicans demanded that the Justice Department aggressively investigate the investigation\u2019s origins, which, they suggested, would show that Trump had been wronged. Did they know that this pursuit might take the form of Trump\u2019s asking Zelensky for \u201ca favor\u201d regarding a phantom Democratic Party server, or Attorney General William Barr\u2019s playing detective in Rome and London? Probably not, but, with Trump, they had good reason to fear something extreme.\n\nThat experience should be a warning to Republicans defending Trump at a time when the full extent of his recklessness is only just being revealed. His refusal to participate won\u2019t put an end to the impeachment inquiry; it will only initiate more fights about subpoenas and witnesses, defiance of court orders, and obstruction of justice. This will all go to the heart of Congress\u2019s right to conduct oversight, and may provide separate grounds for impeachment. (One of the draft articles of impeachment in Watergate concerned Richard Nixon\u2019s failure to honor subpoenas.) Trump has already referred to the impeachment inquiry as a coup. This is not a moment for Republican legislators to stand by and watch as a constitutional crisis unfolds. That is something they have no right to do. \u2666", "description": "A crucial question in the mounting drama is how Republicans in the House and the \u00a0Senate will shape the process, Amy Davidson Sorkin writes.", "authors": ["Amy Davidson Sorkin", "Joshua Rothman", "Charles Duhigg", "Daniel Alarc\u00f3n", "The New Yorker", "Elisabeth Zerofsky", "Robin Wright", "Jeffrey Toobin"], "top_image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d9fd54f25b96f00088b4a09/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/Comment-ADS-ImpeachmentRepublicans-FACEBOOK.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
