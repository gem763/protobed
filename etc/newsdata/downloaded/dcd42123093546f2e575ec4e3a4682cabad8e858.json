The Standing Rock Sioux reservation was the scene of a major protest encampment that was dispersed following a severe police crackdown in 2017.\n\nTokata Iron Eyes, an environmental activist, invited Thunberg, a fellow 16-year-old, to her homelands on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota, after befriending her. On Tuesday the duo spoke at the Standing Rock high school about the burgeoning youth-led climate movement that has seen millions of people strike from school and protest against fossil-fuel projects around the world.\n\n\u201cThis is a global fight; this is not just in my home country in Sweden,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cWe as teenagers shouldn\u2019t be the ones taking responsibility. It should be the ones in power.\u201d\n\nIron Eyes said that indigenous culture was inherently linked to the health of the environment. \u201cNo 16-year-old should have to travel the world in the first place sharing a message about having something as simple as clean water and fresh air to breathe,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a closing ceremony, Thunberg was gifted with a Lakota Native American name, Maphiyata echiyatan hin win, which translates as \u201cwoman who came from the heavens\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thunberg with Iron Eyes at an event on the Pine Ridge reservation.

She is considered the most likely winner of the peace prize, to be awarded on Friday, ahead of the Ethiopian prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, indigenous Brazilian leader Raoni Metuktire and Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand.\n\nThe prize would cap an extraordinary past year for Thunberg, which began with her making solo protests against inaction by the Swedish government on the climate crisis. Her stand her morphed into a mass global movement, with students around the world skipping school on Fridays to call for leaders to do more to address the crisis.\n\nNorth Dakota is the latest, plane-free, trip taken by Thunberg since she arrived in the US in September on a solar-powered yacht. Last month she addressed the United Nations in New York, telling world leaders: \u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d", "description": "Swedish activist, 16, visits North and South Dakota in solidarity with indigenous groups fighting Dakota Access oil pipeline", "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e04fc245c61125ccfcc6316c6a45ff211cc5817/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8763136b8f67e9b6fe688c67fbfc493e", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
