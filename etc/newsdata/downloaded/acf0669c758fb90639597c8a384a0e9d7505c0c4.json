Officials Pass \u2018Emergency Legislation\u2019 to Nix Columbus Day", "language": "en", "text": "Officials in the District of Columbia and other surrounding jurisdictions have passed legislation to erase Italian explorer Christopher Columbus from United States history and replace the day honoring his discovery of the Americas to be Indigenous People\u2019s Day.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the D.C. council passed the bill, but it is still not officially the law in the nation\u2019s capital. The media outlet promoted the narrative that Columbus was a \u201ccolonizer\u201d who abused the people already living in North America, despite the fact that his trip in 1492 and subsequent trips did not include visiting what is now the United States. The Washington Post said:\n\nD.C. Council member David Grosso (I-At Large) proposed emergency legislation this week \u2014 which the council supported Tuesday \u2014 to rename Monday\u2019s holiday Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day. Alexandria and Prince George\u2019s County made similar moves, joining states and jurisdictions across the country that have argued that Christopher Columbus and other colonizers oppressed the native people already living in the Americas when Europeans arrived. In the District, the bill is awaiting the signatures of D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D), according to Grosso\u2019s office. Mendelson and Bowser didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment Thursday. Grosso said Monday on Twitter that he proposed the legislation to \u201cforce a vote of the full Council to finally do the right thing by ending the celebration of the misleading narrative of Christopher Columbus on the second Monday in October in honor of #IndigenousPeoplesDay.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter 5 years, the Council has approved emergency legislation renaming Columbus Day as #IndigenousPeoplesDay. TY to @charlesallen @AnitaBondsDC @marycheh @BrianneKNadeau @RobertWhite_DC @trayonwhite @CMBrandonTodd @tweetelissa @CM_McDuffie for supporting. Let\u2019s make it permanent!\u201d Grosso tweeted:\n\nThe Post noted that Grosso is also opposed to the name of the Washington Redskins football team.\n\n\u201cThe legislation passed this week changes the name only for this year, but Grosso said he hopes to make it permanent,\u201d the Post reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to recognize the people who were already here before we came over from Europe,\u201d Grosso said. \u201cToo often we\u2019ve done a bad job recognizing Native Americans and given too much credit to Columbus.\u201d\n\nThe bill vilifies Columbus as someone who \u201censlaved, colonized, mutilated, and massacred thousands of Indigenous People in the Americas.\u201d\n\nIt says honoring him with a national holiday is \u201cin reverence to a divisive figure whose actions against Indigenous People run counter to the values of equality, diversity, and inclusion \u2014 values that the District of Columbia has long embodied \u2014 and serves only to perpetuate hate and oppression, in contrast to the values the District espouses on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nThe Post reported the city council in Alexandria passed a resolution in September to recognize Indigenous People\u2019s Day as a \u201clocal public holiday,\u201d according to Craig Fifer, a city spokesman.\n\n\u201cIndigenous Peoples have been and continue to be the victims of prejudice and systematic discrimination, which perpetuates high rates of income inequality and exacerbates disproportionate health, education, and social standing,\u201d a statement from the city said.\n\n\u201cIn Prince George\u2019s County, council spokeswoman Karen D. Campbell said county leaders passed legislation changing Columbus Day to Native American Day,\u201d the Post reported. \u201cThe legislation was passed Sept. 10 and goes into effect Nov. 8.\u201d\n\nThe D.C. legislation removing Columbus Day from the local calendar is being celebrated by the National Congress of American Indians, according to the Post.\n\n\u201cIn a city that itself sits on Piscataway land, we commend the D.C. Council for voting to join the growing number of cities, counties, states, and school districts in formally celebrating Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day,\u201d NCAI chief executive Kevin Allis said in a statement. \u201cIt also acknowledges American Indians and Alaska Natives as thriving, contemporary sovereign nations who hold their rightful place among the American family of governments.\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Officials in D.C. and other surrounding jurisdictions are passing legislation to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous People's Day.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/01/wi/ap/21/b76f8c_notre-dame-columbus-murals-86814-in-nov-29-2017-photo-kristin-fabian-walks-e1548185124637.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
