These are jobs that immigrants could take and do take. Why reduce legal immigration and take potential workers out of the labor force?\n\nFeldmann\u2019s question echoes the D.C. consensus that immigration is a tool to boost the government\u2019s clout and investors\u2019 returns, regardless of the economic and civic impact on lower-status Americans.\n\nBut Cuccinelli\u2019s polite answer reflects President Donald Trump\u2019s semi-revolutionary and populist task of reshaping immigration rules to help ordinary Americans, not just wealthy investors.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of pressure in various sectors to utilize more immigrant labor for employment, whether it is for high-tech or low-tech in the economy \u2026 [but the president] has also made clear that is is important to protect ordinary American workers and to not displace them,\u201d said Cuccinelli, who runs the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency.\n\nFinding the right balance between helping Americans workers and Americans investors is a constant political dilemma, Cuccinelli said:\n\nIs there some perfect [balanced] target point in every industry? Maybe there is, but we\u2019re never going to be able to know it. So which side do you err on? And he has repeatedly emphasized how important it is to protect U.S. workers. Now\u2019s he been clear with me, as well, and you all have heard him say it: he wants to see economic growth and dynamism. And that means, you know, growing companies needing to fill slots. So we\u2019re just in a constant battle to balance those things.\n\nTrump\u2019s lower-immigration \u201cHire American\u201d policies are helping to boost the salaries of the lower-income Americans. For example, Indeed.com reported in September that wages for \u201clower wage\u201d people rose by roughly 4.5 percent from July 2018 to July 2019.\n\nTrump\u2019s deputies are signaling that they plan to tout those popular pay raises in the 2020 election:\n\nDems, NYT & CNN don't want to talk about wage raises \u2013 but Trump is touting wage raises he's getting for blue-collars in his lower-migration economy. So maybe DC opposes salary raises for the Democrats' core of post-grad progressives? See the #S386 debate. https://t.co/sxWa2vSdbb \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 16, 2019\n\nIn contrast, wages for higher-paid Americans grew slower, at roughly 2.7 percent, according to Indeed.com.\n\nIn part, the slower growth among higher-paid Americans reflects the ability to investors\u2019 to keep roughly 1.5 million foreign graduates in jobs sought by U.S. college graduates. Many of those foreign graduates work in sweatshop conditions for little pay in the expectation they eventually will be paid with valuable, government-provided green-cards.\n\nFor example, Google and Facebook hire many OPT, L-1, and H-1B visa-workers, even as the two companies also grab most of the advertising revenues from American college graduates in the newspaper business.\n\nCensus data shows how huge numbers of American software graduates have been replaced by Indian & Chinese visa-workers in N.J., California, N.C., Georgia, N.Y., Texas, Virginia, Florida, and other states. Next: Healthcare professionals. @S386 https://t.co/qH9p4Ynd34 \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 3, 2019\n\nDomestic politics may play a part. Trump was elected by blue-collar Americans amid lopsided and angry opposition by post-graduate professionals.\n\nSince 2016, Trump has zig-zagged on his policy towards the importation of foreign college graduates.\n\nIn 2016, he denounced the widespread use of the huge H-1B program but did not promise to end the visa worker programs.\n\nIn office, he has done little to reduce the resident number of college graduate visa workers, and his deputies have told the Supreme Court that Trump agrees that President Barack Obama had the right to award work permits to the DACA illegal aliens.\n\nHe has also pushed back against proposals to curb the inflow of lower-wage Chinese graduates into prestigious jobs at U.S. universities, such as biotech laboratories \u2014 despite the predictable harm to the careers of U.S. scientists. On October 11, for example, Trump told reporters:\n\nWe\u2019re going to be very good to Chinese students. Nope. I\u2019ve heard this question many times before, including from our own security people. We want all the people that want to come over from China. We have the greatest university system in the world, and we\u2019re going to keep it that way. And one of the reasons it\u2019s great is we have a lot of students from China. No, we\u2019re not going to make it tough. We\u2019re going to make it like for everybody else. Okay? We\u2019re going to make it \u2014 I think that\u2019s important. \u2026 I want them coming here. We want the greatest talent in the world coming to our great universities \u2014 to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, the great Wharton School of Finance \u2014 to Stanford, all of these great schools. We want them \u2014 we want them coming here. And that\u2019s what we have. And that\u2019s one of the reasons we have the great system. And there have been discussing about [stopping] that \u2014 not by me, because I ended them very quickly. I want to let you know, I end those discussions very quickly.\n\nBut Trump has paid little price for the visa programs that displace U.S. post-graduates \u2014 partly because few post-graduates want to recognize that migration threatens their salaries and careers via the Economics 101 law of supply and demand.\n\nFor example, the establishment media has done little to examine the scale of white-collar outsourcing \u2014 even as Congress debates bills to supercharge the U.S.-India Otsouring Economy.\n\nInstead, establishment reporters have preferred to focus on their sympathies and attention on the interests of migrants and the claim that Americans must be a \u201cbeacon of hope\u201d for migrants worldwide.", "description": "The government's immigration policy must benefit ordinary Americans, not just American investors, citizenship chief Ken Cuccinelli said.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/GettyImages-1161257286-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
