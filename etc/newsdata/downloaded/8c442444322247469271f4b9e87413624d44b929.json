He was the first openly gay U.S. male athlete to win a medal in a Winter Olympics, and at 28, a decade older than his teammates. After retiring from competing, he won the 26th season of \u201cDancing with the Stars,\u201d and \u2014 well, let\u2019s not turn this into the Adam Rippon Wikipedia page. (\u201cWhich, honestly, is really worth a read,\u201d he assures. \u201cI\u2019ve spent several hours there myself.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBrimming with Rippon\u2019s signature sass, \u201cBeautiful\u201d is an entertaining, unfiltered look at the path to becoming an elite athlete \u2014 and it\u2019s not all fun and (Olympic) games. Yes, we\u2019ll see our delightful skater grow and evolve and, by the end, figure out the true joy of sport. But he shines brightest as he theatrically recounts the times his life was like \u201ca raging dumpster fire.\u201d To be clear: Rippon is funny. He lands a joke like it\u2019s a triple axel, with eyebrow-raising, hilarious passages that demand to be read out loud to whomever is nearby.\n\nWithin a couple years of starting to skate seriously at age 10, Rippon traded public school for home school. He cycled through a rotation of coaches, which required him to move to different cities and live with whomever would have him. He was away so often that when his youngest brother had to draw a photo of the entire family for school, Rippon was omitted. \u201cAdam\u2019s not in the family,\u201d the boy told their mom of six. \u201cAdam\u2019s the babysitter.\u201d\n\nLife away from home wasn\u2019t the parent-free nirvana a teen might imagine \u2014 an elite athlete does little other than train. After a particularly poor skate, his mortified Russian coach chastised him: \u201cYou like having friends, don\u2019t you?\u201d When he answered in the affirmative, she responded, \u201cWell, they\u2019re not going to be your friends if you don\u2019t skate well.\u201d Another time, the coach charged Rippon\u2019s mom a shame surcharge \u2014 an extra $500 for the shame of being associated with him after a less-than-stellar performance.\n\nThat kind of pressure underscores Rippon\u2019s recollections: Beneath the jokes, there\u2019s a suffocating need to win, and a never-ending quest to be perfect \u2014 and thin enough, strong enough, fast enough, dedicated enough. To afford it all. To enjoy a balanced life \u2014 without disappointing anyone invested in his success. Rippon recalls one attempt to placate his mother by distancing himself from a distracting boyfriend: \u201cI would go back to being like a Ken doll with just a flat plastic front who did nothing except eat, sleep, and skate,\u201d he writes.\n\n\u201cBeautiful\u201d is breezy and chatty, as though Rippon is massaging the script for one of his Instagram stories. He\u2019s a pro at well-placed pop culture references and, where some elite athletes seem otherworldly \u2014 made from different stuff \u2014 he comes across as the relatable Olympian next door. His flair for storytelling peaks in tune with the drama surrounding his life: desperate financial struggles through his 20s; the devastation of failing to qualify for the 2014 Olympics; a catastrophic injury ahead of the 2018 games. In particularly compelling chapters, he reveals how he came out both personally and professionally \u2014 and how being gay affected his skating career. (\u201cIt\u2019s not an overt homophobia, where gay skaters are punished, but a softer and equally insidious version of it,\u201d he describes.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe now equates his sexuality to a \u201cfun fact . . . like any other bit of biographical trivia.\u201d But it was a headline-grabber during the games, when Rippon publicly criticized Vice President Pence, who was chosen as the head of the U.S. delegation to the PyeongChang Games, for not supporting gay people. The feud culminated in a Twitter spat with various members of the administration.\n\nOnce the cacophony calmed down, and after claiming his medal, Rippon ran into the U.S. men\u2019s hockey team at a party. The members all wanted to take a photo with him because their girlfriends were fans. \u201cIt was like \u2018Freaky Friday\u2019 to me,\u201d he writes. When he was a shy little kid, everyone on the hockey team wanted to beat him up. \u201cNow they all wanted to take my picture and I was trying to be their friend. If I had a dollar for every girlfriend selfie I took with an athlete, I would have made back all the money I had spent on training to get myself to the Olympics in the first place.\u201d\n\nSo, okay. Rippon might have gone home from the athletic world\u2019s largest stage with a bronze medal in tow. But this memoir? It\u2019s pure comedic gold.\n\nAngela Haupt is a freelance writer and full-time health editor in D.C.\n\nBeautiful on the Outside\n\nA Memoir\n\nBy Adam Rippon\n\nGrand Central. $28. 256 pp\n\nAD", "description": "But his memoir, \u201cBeautiful on the Outside,\u201d makes the comedic most of his low points.", "authors": ["Angela Haupt", "Freelance Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4HgToW2MxZLYkG3uz0XdcKQv_1I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NMSD5OXPNII6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
