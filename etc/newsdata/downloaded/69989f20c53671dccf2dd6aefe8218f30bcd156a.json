I almost always have been and probably will be forever.\n\nGrowing up, the word \u2018fat\u2019 was terrifying. The only times I heard it was when it was loaded with venom and designed to hurt \u2013 a three-letter word with the purpose to threaten you into changing what you look like.\n\nAt school, I would always be the first to make the joke about my size to avoid being the butt of someone else\u2019s. I adopted this \u2018fat funny friend\u2019 persona as an armour to do battle in the world. So, if anything, I was called out for being too loud or even over-confident, rather than for my size.\n\nAs a result, no one at school ever really called me fat, or at least not to my face. Instead, this word was used as ammunition at home and a catalyst for the yearly summer holiday weight-loss project.\n\nIt was only once I left drama school a few years ago, that I started to reclaim the word \u2018fat\u2019 for me and my body. As I began to look for work, I found that I was \u2018too big\u2019 to play the \u2018normal parts\u2019 \u2013 but \u2018not big enough\u2019 to be \u2018the fat girl\u2019.\n\nI pictured my fat body as temporary and so never made it a home (Picture: David Cheskin)\n\nAround the same time, I also started to tap into the online fat community and discovered other artists who were making works about fatness and their bodies. It genuinely blew my mind that people could be fat and happy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI had consistently been fed a rhetoric by the media and people around me that fat people were just lazy and unhealthy \u2013 that they could never be happy in their bodies and not want to change them. But these bloggers and artists and other people across the world were taking up space in their glorious fat bodies without the want or need to change.\n\nFor so long, I pictured my fat body as temporary and so never made it a home. I never bought it expensive clothes, but instead splashed out on things I aspired to squeeze into. I didn\u2019t touch it, feed it or love it properly, but focused on how little time I could spend in it. So, once I realised there was a world where this didn\u2019t have to be the case, my mindset began to change.\n\nI have had to work really hard to take ownership of, and some days even love, my label of fat (Picture: David Cheskin for Metro.co.uk)\n\nI can\u2019t pretend this happened overnight \u2013 that I suddenly clapped my big fat thighs together and everything was over \u2013 because it definitely wasn\u2019t like that. Rather, I began joining the conversation, learning more about the Fat Activist Movement and then started to make my own work around it. This quickly snowballed into writing a one-woman show about my experiences of living in a fat body, subtly called FATTY FAT FAT, and taking up space publicly as a fat person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis process effectively forced me to \u2018come out\u2019 as fat in big way.\n\nLiving in a fat body is inherently political; everyday actions are met with confrontation, criticism and aggression.\n\nOur capitalist culture is force-feeding us the idea that we are the before photo you should be scared of, that we are unlovable and that we don\u2019t deserve to be treated fairly by our healthcare system. Some days it\u2019s harder to ignore than others, especially as we live in a day and age where you can\u2019t complete your commute without seeing a diet pill advert or the latest Cancer Research campaign.\n\nI have had to work really hard to take ownership of, and some days even love, my label of fat. It\u2019s not easy or linear, and the bad days often feel worse because it feels like you are letting the side down, but for me it\u2019s about knowing only I have the right to decide what my body is or isn\u2019t.\n\nLive your best fat life (Picture: David Cheskin for Metro.co.uk)\n\nUltimately fat is a descriptive word just like any other, and it\u2019s one I\u2019ve chosen to describe me and my body.\n\nAlthough it is complex for a lot of people, the more we untie it from the connotations it\u2019s been given, the freer we are to go and live our best fat lives.\n\nLabels Labels is an exclusive series that hears from individuals who have been labelled \u2013 whether that be by society, a job title, or a diagnosis. Throughout the project, writers will share how having these words ascribed to them shaped their identity \u2014 positively or negatively \u2014 and what the label means to them.
