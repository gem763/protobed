Ninety-nine leaders are men, and the list includes only one woman.\n\nRoss Stores CEO Barbara Rentler places at No. 75 on the list.\n\nThe rankings are presented by HSBC Bank and are prefaced by the question, \"Who are the most creative and successful business minds of today?\"\n\nForbes enlisted two male business school professors and a male consultant to compile the rankings, which they said are based on a methodology of four factors:\n\nMedia reputation for innovation\n\nSocial connections/capital\n\nTrack record for value creation\n\nInvestor expectations for value creation\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk are tied for first place, with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff, and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings rounding out the top five.\n\nRead more: MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito resigns after New Yorker expos\u00e9 shows he quietly worked with Epstein to secure anonymous donations\n\nLeah McGowen-Hare, the vice president of Trailforce, Salesforce's educational library division, noted on Twitter that the list also only included three Latino people (all men) and no black people.\n\nTIME Magazine's editor at large Anand Giridharadas wrote a Twitter thread about the list, noting that \"there are twice as many men named Stanley as there are women of any name. And there are only two Stanleys.\"\n\nHe continued: \"When a publication like @Forbes has so many eyes on an article and it goes out with this grievous an error in judgment, it shows how so much of the current leadership class needs to go, frankly. These are the editors deciding what and who to publish, what stories to tell.\"\n\nForbes didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.", "description": "Forbes published a list of 100 of America's 'most innovative' leaders based on things like media reputation and track record, and listed 99 men.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7413942e22af554e55f953-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
