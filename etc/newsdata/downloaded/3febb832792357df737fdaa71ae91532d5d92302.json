Rowe Price (TROW) Q3 Earnings Top Estimates, AUM Escalates", "language": "en", "text": "T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. TROW reported a positive earnings surprise of 7.6% in third-quarter 2019. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.13, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.98. Results also improved 7% from the year-ago figure of $1.99.\n\n\n\nResults were driven by higher assets under management (AUM) and revenues. However, escalating expenses were an undermining factor.\n\n\n\nIncluding certain non-recurring items, net income came in at $545.9 million or $2.23 per share compared with $583 million or $2.30 per share recorded in the prior-year quarter.\n\n\n\nRevenues Up Y/Y, Expenses Flare Up\n\n\n\nNet revenues in the third quarter increased 2.3% to $1.43 billion from the year-ago quarter. This upside primarily resulted from higher investment advisory fees, partly offset by lower administrative, distribution and servicing fees. The net revenue figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 billion.\n\n\n\nInvestment advisory fees climbed 3.2% year over year. However, administrative, distribution and servicing fees declined 6.1% year over year to $123.3 million.\n\n\n\nInvestment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds, distributed in the United States, were up 0.4% year over year to $881 million. Investment advisory revenues earned from other investment portfolios, managed by the company, increased 9.4% from the prior-year quarter to $422.4 million.\n\n\n\nTotal adjusted operating expenses flared up 2.8% year over year to $765.1 million in the third quarter. Rise in compensation and related costs, technology, occupancy, and facility costs along with higher general, administrative, and other expenses resulted in this upsurge. Including certain one-time items, expenses were $767.6 million, up 1.8%.\n\n\n\nAs of Sep 30, 2019, T. Rowe Price employed 7,262 associates, around 3.3% higher than the last year.\n\n\n\nStrong Assets Position\n\n\n\nAs of Sep 30, 2019, total AUM climbed 3.9% year over year to $1.13 trillion. During the July-September quarter, net market depreciation and income, came in at $1 billion, while net cash inflow was $2.5 billion after client transfers.\n\n\n\nT. Rowe Price remains debt free with substantial liquidity, including cash and sponsored portfolio investment holdings of about $5.6 billion as of Sep 30, 2019, which enable the company to keep on investing.\n\n\n\nCapital-Deployment Activity\n\n\n\nDuring third-quarter 2019, T. Rowe Price repurchased 1.6 million shares of its common stock for $173.1 million, and invested $148.9 million in capitalized technology and facilities using available cash balances in the first nine months of 2019.\n\n\n\nFor 2019, the company projects capital expenditures at approximately $200 million, comprising two-third for technology development.\n\n\n\nOutlook\n\n\n\nT. Rowe Price has updated full-year 2019 non-GAAP operating expense growth guidance to 4-5% from the prior range of 4-7%. This is mainly due to lower-than-planned year-to-date distribution, product-related and professional fee expenses, along with headcount growth.\n\n\n\nOur Viewpoint\n\n\n\nT. Rowe Price witnessed an impressive quarter with stellar revenues. The company\u2019s financial stability has the potential to benefit from growth opportunities in domestic and global AUM. The company\u2019s debt-free position, higher return on earnings and improvement in investor sentiment, as a whole, makes us confident of its robust fundamentals. Furthermore, a relatively better mutual fund performance is a positive.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, higher operating expenses are a concern.\n\n\n\nT. Rowe Price Group, Inc.

However, the figure was 4.9% lower than the year-ago quarter\u2019s number. Results benefited from an improvement in revenues. Moreover, growth in AUM, driven by net inflows, was a positive. However, higher expenses hurt results to some extent.\n\n\n\nFranklin Resources, Inc.
