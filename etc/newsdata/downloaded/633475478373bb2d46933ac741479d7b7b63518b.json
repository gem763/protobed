Ranch, or the Columbia Ranch as it is also known.\n\nWhile the majority of Hocus Pocus was filmed in Salem, some parts, such as the scene in question, were shot in LA at the Warner Bros. studios - where Friends was also filmed.\n\nThe fountain has believed to have been part of the Ranch since 1935.", "description": "Eagle-eyed Friends fans have just noticed a big similarity between Friends and the Disney movie Hocus Pocus", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20530276.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Friends-opening-sceneNBC.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
