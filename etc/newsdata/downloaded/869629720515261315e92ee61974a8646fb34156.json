Saving the best for the last, we witnessed an epic lineup of designers and some jaw-dropping collections.\n\nFrom beauty looks to accessories, fab garments to celebrity show stoppers, here are the best moments from the shows that you need to know about:\n\n1. Best show: Lovebirds Studios\n\nLovebirds Studios hosted an offsite show for a reason--every garment that they showcased on the runway stood out in their own right. Possibly the best show of this season, everything was minimal, breezy, and perfect to the T. We fell in love with the feature-light dresses, tuxedos, and skirts combos and the fuss-free runway.\n\n2. The fiery debutants: Notebook and Sameer Madan\n\nEach year, we see a collection of new designers with a promise to take fashion in the country by storm. Fresh perspectives, unique designs, and a contemporary approach made this season\u2019s \u201cYoung Guns\u201d show very memorable. We saw some chic androgynous silhouettes at the Notebook runway and Sameer Madan delivered some very chic clothes that reimagined luxe pr\u00eat in India.\n\n3. Best hair and makeup\n\nWe also spotted some drool-worthy beauty looks at the \u201cYoung Guns\u201d collective. Bindis got a quirky spin and plaits reared their glam heads out. The faces were clean and matt with statement wing-tipped eyeliners and a dash of pink lipgloss--the ideal makeup we\u2019d love to stay in all summer all day!\n\n4. Coolest runway: Shivan and Narresh\n\nInarguably the coolest designers in the country, resort-wear duo Shivan and Narresh showcased a trans seasonal collection that we\u2019d wear all year long (if we had the money to, of course). Puffer jackets, lacey jumpsuits, and the S&N signature swimsuits; \u2018Seoul Series\u2019 was as international and glam as LMIFW could get!\n\n5. Quirkiest collection: Manish Arora\n\nWe don\u2019t remember when was the last time the Paris Fashion Week regular Manish Arora showed a collection in his own country. So when FDCI released the lineup of this season, his name caught our utmost attention! The King of all things quirky, Manish displayed a collection that very well defined why he is, what he is! Lots of neon accents, bright pink dresses, wacky accessories, and larger-than-life silhouettes, it reminded us that fashion need not always be wearable, sometimes it can be avant garde and awe-inspiring--just like a piece of art.\n\n6. Best showstopper: Kangana Ranaut\n\nAdding \u2018grand\u2019 to the \u2018finale\u2019 the Queen Kangana Ranaut walked down the runway in true style. Wearing a puffy black skirt, white shirt, and some seriously gorg jewellery; she literally set the stage on fire with her glam presence and superstar charm! (And mind you, unlike others, she arrived on time for the shows.)\n\n\n\n", "description": "From glam beauty looks to jaw-dropping accessories, fab garments to celebrity show stoppers, here are the best moments from the shows that you need to know about, ASAP!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://im.idiva.com/content/2019/Oct/Idiva_LMIFW_SS20_Day_4_Social_5da2c8da045f1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
