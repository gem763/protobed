Chrystal tells us how she came into her line of work and has some advice for those aspiring to a career in aviation.\n\nThe start\n\nChrystal began her aviation journey back in 2001. \u201cI started my journey at 43 Air School in Port Alfred after I finished high school. They have a well-planned and very structured pilot training programme, which meant I received my Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) before the end of the year. In that year, training also included 40 hours to earn my Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which is for recreational flying. Further commercial training included learning to fly at night as well as in and above the clouds, flying more complex twin-engine aircraft and eight commercial pilot exams.\u201d\n\nStudies\n\n\u201cIn order to complete the course, you need to pass 8\u201314 (depending on your country) aviation-related exams. The exams are usually multiple choice \u2013 which sounds easier than you think \u2013 and include subjects like flight planning, meteorology, navigation, instrumentation, aircraft technical, etc. Of course, you would also need to pass the actual flying tests too,\u201d Chrystal says.\n\nCareer Pride\n\nChrystal tells us what she loves most about her career as a Pilot. \u201cThere is nothing more inspiring than watching the sun rise while everyone else is asleep behind you. The views from the flight deck are epic. Also, the feeling you get arriving at the world\u2019s largest airports and knowing \u201cyou\u201d were the one to safely land that great, big machine creates a sense of pride I know would be difficult to acquire in any other job,\u201d she says.\n\nWords of advice\n\nChrystal says those who aspire to a career in aviation should not limit themselves in any way from achieving their career desires. \u201cHave a positive personality and obtain the right skills, and you\u2019re set,\u201d Chrystal says.", "description": "Recently Chrystal shared her career journey as a Pilot with us.
