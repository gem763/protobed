This agreement with the plaintiffs' counsel is a major step, and one that we hoped for a long time would be possible,\" Jim Murren, chairman and chief executive of MGM Resorts said in a statement.\n\nMourners hold candles in the air during a moment of silence during a vigil to remember the Las Vegas shooting victims [File: Drew Angerer/Getty Images]\n\nDr Heather Melton, an orthopaedic surgeon whose husband, Sonny, died shielding her from the gunfire, said she had mixed feelings about the settlement.\n\n190703141151149\n\n\"There's some good that comes from it, it will help give families closure and alleviates their ongoing medical costs,\" she said. \"But there's no amount of money I would take to not get my husband back.\"\n\nPolice and the FBI found that Paddock meticulously planned the attack and theorised that he may have sought notoriety. But they said they never determined a clear motive.\n\nAs legal claims piled up, MGM drew outrage when it filed lawsuits last year against more than 1,900 victims in a bid to avoid liability. The company argued that it did not owe anything to survivors or families of slain victims under a federal law enacted after the September 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nChelsea Romo, a 30-year-old single mother from Temecula, California, who lost her left eye and had shrapnel lodged in her brain, said she hopes the penalty will lead to measures that make public places safer against mass shootings.\n\n190517015300542\n\n\"The past can't be changed,\" she said. \"I guess as far as going forward, if things can be safer and better, that's all I really could ask for.\"\n\nThe settlement announced on Thursday creates the third-largest victims' compensation fund in US history, according to a claims administrator who has doled out money in major attacks and disasters. Kenneth Feinberg, who was not involved in the Las Vegas deal, said he oversaw $7.1bn in victim compensation after the 9/11 attacks and $6.5bn following the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.", "description": "MGM reaches settlement with survivors, families of 58 people killed in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/7/18/b13fe9c633c747c6a4e58b0e89635671_18.jpg"}
