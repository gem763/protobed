That was down from average growth of 190,000 a month in the eight years since employment started picking up after the last recession. The August tally was propped up in part by the addition of 25,000 temporary Census Bureau workers by the U.S. government, while estimates of payrolls in July and June were revised down.\n\n\u201cI do think the economy is slowing,\u201d said Eric Winograd, senior U.S. economist for investment-management firm AllianceBernstein. \u201cAs growth slows, it\u2019s natural that firms will pull back a little bit on the pace of hiring.\u201d\n\nStocks rose slightly on the news. Though the bellwether report pointed to a slowing economy, it also affirmed market expectations that the Federal Reserve will reduce short-term interest rates this month. Lower interest rates tend to lift shares.\n\nThere were some bright spots in Friday\u2019s job market report. A survey of households showed the share of workers aged 25 to 54 working or seeking work increased to 82.6% in August from 82% in July, the largest monthly increase since 1960 and a signal that working-age individuals remain optimistic about their job prospects.\n\nMeanwhile, pay is holding up after slowing a bit in the spring. Average hourly earnings climbed 3.2% from August 2018, enough to keep worker earnings well above the inflation rate. The pay measure has now been above the 3% threshold for more than a year after lagging for much of the expansion.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is that the wage increases, which had slowed, seem to be coming back,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. \u201cThat points to the simple fact that the labor market really is tight.\u201d\n\nThe unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7% in August for the third consecutive month. The jobless rate remains near a 50-year low, a sign of job security and plentiful work opportunities for millions of individuals.\n\nStill, its downward trajectory appears to have lost some momentum. At its August level, the jobless rate was little changed from 3.8% a year earlier. Between 2010 and 2018, by contrast, it fell on average 0.6 percentage point a year.\n\nInvestors have been shaken in recent months by signs the global economy is slowing. On Friday China\u2019s central bank released 900 billion yuan ($126 billion) to banks to spur the economy, and the Bank of Russia cut its key interest rate for the third time this year.\n\nEarlier this week the Institute for Supply Management reported its closely watched gauge of U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in three years in August. The report\u2014coming after data pointing to contracting factory activity in the U.K., Germany, Japan and South Korea\u2014fueled fears that a manufacturing slowdown elsewhere in the world had reached the U.S.\n\nMany business executives have said in conference calls with investors in recent weeks that uncertainty about trade between the U.S. and China is clouding their outlook.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nSummit Brewing Co., a St. Paul, Minn.-based brewery with 80 employees, is pulling back on hiring to contain cost pressures cropping up due to global trade fights, including a recent 20% price increase for aluminum cans tied to tariffs.\n\nMark Stutrud, Summit Brewing\u2019s president, said Summit has also deferred capital spending on some projects, including adding fermentation tanks to a research facility. Yet despite a slowdown in business, Mr. Stutrud has boosted employee pay an average 3.5% over the past year to retain workers.\n\n\u201cWe have to be very competitive where it comes to wages and benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy is healthy.\u201d\n\nForecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers projects economic output in the third quarter will grow at an annual rate of 2%, matching the 2% pace in the second quarter while down from 2.9% in 2018.\n\nPresident Trump has argued that the Federal Reserve is holding back the economy with higher-than-necessary interest rates.\n\nSigns of a global slowdown have sent yields on U.S. long-term bonds tumbling, in anticipation of low inflation and Fed rate cuts to stimulate economic activity.\n\nIn futures markets, investors are pricing in a quarter-percentage-point interest-rate cut by the Fed at its policy meeting Sept. 17-18. Rate cuts are meant to spur growth by reducing the cost of borrowing, thus making it cheaper for businesses to invest and for consumers to purchase big-ticket items like homes and cars.\n\n\u201cThe Fed should lower rates,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a tweet Friday morning. \u201cThey were WAY too early to raise, and Way too late to cut.\u201d\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell, speaking in Zurich, Switzerland, said lower rates have already helped to support the economy. He did little to push back against expectations for another rate move this month. \u201cOur labor market is in quite a strong position,\u201d he said, playing down fears of recession.\n\nManufacturers added 3,000 employees to their payrolls in August, another sign of slowdown. So far this year, manufacturing payrolls have grown 27,000, compared with growth over the same period in 2018 of 154,000 and in 2017 of 91,000.\n\nManufacturing overtime dipped to 3.2 hours a week, the lowest level since April 2017. Workers at Pennsylvania-based Norcen Industries Inc., which distributes plastics to manufacturers and runs a precision machine shop, typically log five to 10 hours of overtime a week during the busy summer season.\n\nBut business has slowed and now there is just enough work to keep them occupied for a regular 40-hour work week, said Josh Williams, Norcen\u2019s president.\n\nCustomers are \u201cholding off on ordering stuff,\u201d he Mr. Williams said, citing trade-related cost increases. \u201cThey\u2019re all worried about pricing.\u201d\n\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com", "description": "U.S. employment grew modestly in August and unemployment showed signs of stabilizing at historically low levels, signs that a global slowdown has dented the growth outlook.", "authors": ["Sarah Chaney", "Sarah.Chaney Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-102419/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
