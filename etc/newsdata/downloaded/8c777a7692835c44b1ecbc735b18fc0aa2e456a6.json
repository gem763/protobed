Huffman will also be subject to a supervised year of release, serve 250 hours of community service, and must pay $30,000 in fines.\n\nHuffman was in federal court today facing one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, to which she pled guilty in May. As one of the parents implicated in the college admissions scandal \u2014 aka Operation Varsity Blues \u2014 that has rocked Hollywood and dozens of wealthy families in California and beyond, she admitted to paying William \u201cRick\u201d Singer $15,000 to falsify her daughter\u2019s SAT scores.\n\nProsecutors asked for $20,000, a year of supervised release, and one month jail time for Huffman, whose attorneys argued instead that she should be put on probation, pay the fine, and serve 250 hours of community service. Huffman was the first of nearly three dozens parents caught up in the scheme. Her husband, William H. Macy, wasn\u2019t charged. Huffman\u2019s attorneys have argued that Huffman should be treated with more lenience because she paid the smallest amount for Singer\u2019s services and did not involve her child in the scheme, unlike some parents, including, allegedly, Lori Loughlin, who is accused of trying to pass her daughters off as crew team members to help their applications to USC.\n\nThe severity of Huffman\u2019s punishment has been a public flashpoint, in the context of how severely non-white, non-wealthy defendants also accused of non-violent crimes like mail fraud are routinely sentenced. At the sentencing, according to a court reporter, U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen said, \u201cIf a poor single mom from Akron \u2026 goes to jail, there is no reason why a wealthy privileged mother should avoid that same fate.\u201d Last week, in a letter submitted to the judge in the case, Huffman said she \u201ctalked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot. I see the irony in that statement now because what I have done is the opposite of fair. I have broken the law, deceived the educational community, betrayed my daughter, and failed my family.\u201d\n\nAt the sentencing, when it was her turn to speak, a reportedly tearful Huffman said that she \u201cwas frightened, I was stupid and I was so wrong. I am deeply ashamed of what I have done.\u201d\n\nHuffman's daughter asked her, when she learned of the scheme, \"why didn't you believe in me? Why didn't you think I could do it on my own?,\" Huffman said.\n\n\n\n\"I was frightened, I was stupid and I was so wrong. I am deeply ashamed of what I have done.\" \u2014 Chris Villani (@ChrisVillani44) September 13, 2019\n\nIn her sentencing remarks, the judge, Hon. Indira Talwani, said that \u201cthe outrage in this case is a system that is already so distorted by money and privilege in the first place \u2026 In a system in that context, that you took the step of having one more advantage to put your child ahead.\u201d", "description": "Felicity Huffman is the first parent to be sentenced in the Operation Varsity Blues college admissions scandal, for which she just received two weeks in prison, fines, and community service.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/13/13-felicity-huffman.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
