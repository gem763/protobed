Flowers had also been placed next to the grave.\n\nPictures of Zhao and Liang were placed on stands at the site during yesterday's burial, according to photos published by the South China Morning Post and the BBC.\n\nBut these photos had been removed a day later. The guards blocked attempts by AFP journalists to take photos or videos at the site.\n\nZhao was not laid to rest at the Baobashan Cemetery as was customary for revolutionary heroes and Communist Party luminaries.\n\nAttendance at Friday's burial was limited to \"just family and relatives,\" Wang said, estimating that about 20 people or fewer attended the ceremony, though others joined later.\n\nZhao's opposition to using deadly military force to crack down on democracy protests in Tiananmen Square came at a high cost \u2014 the former premier and Communist Party general secretary was sacked and lived under house arrest for 16 years until his death.\n\nZhao opposed Deng Xiaoping's imposition of martial law in 1989, when hundreds of unarmed civilians \u2014 by some estimates, more than 1,000 \u2014 were killed on June 4, a move for which he has frequently been criticised.\n\nHe has however drawn acclaim for carrying out economic reforms in the 1980s that created opportunities for many people.", "description": "A former Chinese Communist Party leader ousted after he opposed the use of force to quell 1989 democracy protests was buried over a decade after he died, his family said, in a service ignored by state media.
