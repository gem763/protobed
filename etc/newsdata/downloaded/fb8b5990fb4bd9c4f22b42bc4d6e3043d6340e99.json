REUTERS/Andres Cuenca Olaondo\n\nThe company Varela works for, Fotmer Life Sciences, has just made the first commercial shipment of medical cannabis from Latin America, 10 kg (22 lb) of dried flowers with high levels of active ingredient THC destined for patients in Australia.\n\nThe small but landmark export underscores the country\u2019s push into the burgeoning market for legal cannabis, that has medical uses including helping cancer patients manage chronic pain or treating spasms associated with multiple sclerosis.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to create a billion-dollar industry here in Uruguay in the next five to seven years,\u201d Jordan Lewis, chief executive of Fotmer Life Sciences, told Reuters at the Montevideo lab. The firm soon hopes to announce shipments to the European Union, where Germany is the key market, he added.\n\nUruguay has been ahead of the curve. It was the first country to legalize the growing, sale and smoking of marijuana in December 2013 in a pioneering social experiment closely watched by other nations debating drug liberalization.\n\nThe number of countries legalizing the use of medical cannabis is expected to almost double to around 80 in the future, Lewis said, \u201ccreating a potential (global) market of $100 billion in the next ten years.\u201d\n\nIn the coming weeks the firm will begin exporting 100 kg each month of dried flowers and cannabis extracts, Lewis said.\n\nThe potential is clear. While market forecasts range widely, advisory and investment bank Cowen Inc predicts the U.S. cannabis market alone could be worth $80 billion by 2030.\n\nPOT PROFICIENCY\n\nIn the company\u2019s facilities, in a science park complex 21 km (13 miles) from Montevideo\u2019s center, Varela\u2019s team of scientists are taking things seriously. To get into the white-walled labs, visitors must wear plastic cloth shoes, a tunic, cap, mask and latex gloves.\n\nVarela says it is vital to control the quality of the environment for the cannabis plants, especially given the high global standards needed for making medicines as well as in the handling of agricultural products.\n\nEach plant has a number and bar code, part of system to track the production process and catch possible genetic issues. There were 350 marijuana plants growing and 27 different genetic varieties when Reuters visited.\n\nThe plants once ready are transferred to 18 industrial-size greenhouses in Nueva Helvecia, 120 km away, equipped with drying, curing and packaging machinery.\n\nVarela, a biochemist, got interested in studying the uses of cannabis while doing a doctorate in the Netherlands. When he returned to Uruguay, he joined one of the early projects being done by Uruguayan Fernando Sass\u00f3n along with American Lewis.\n\nUruguay\u2019s support for the industry has put it at the forefront of the growing global market, he said.\n\n\u201cAs we see legalization happening at a global and regional level, Uruguay is pushing ahead to develop highly-qualified people with the right skills really quickly.\u201d", "description": "In a white, sterilized laboratory on the outskirts of Uruguayan capital Montevideo, biochemist Javier Varela and his team are carefully cultivating plants for a booming multibillion-dollar global market in medical marijuana.", "authors": ["Fabian Werner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436183553&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910MS"}
