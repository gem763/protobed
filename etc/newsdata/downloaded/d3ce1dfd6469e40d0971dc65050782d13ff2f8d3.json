This week we look at how to make a living space feel both luxe and understated .\n\n\n\nAn elegant space outfitted with opulent touches doesn\u2019t have to mean an interior that\u2019s dipped in gold. Adding noble accents and materials in a quiet way will keep the feel timeless. \u201cMore and more clients say they want a home that feels special but isn\u2019t too precious,\u201d said Donna Classi, Ethan Allen design consultant. \u201cTo me, that means choosing the finest quality you can afford\u2014\u2013from a statement chandelier or a hand-knotted rug to luxurious linens and fine art\u2013\u2013and letting it speak for itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere, advice from design pros to create a lavish space that\u2019s low key.\n\n\n\nStrike a Balance\n\n\n\n\u201cI have always been drawn to things that are wooden and chunky and natural\u2014nothing precious\u2013approachable, yet luxurious, which I think sums up the quintessential California lifestyle: high-quality craftsmanship but understated finishes. Silhouettes and materials that are organic/modern/fresh, but with some sort of grounding to them.\n\n\n\n\u201cI also love the idea of tension, the combination of a beautiful antique with a modern sofa, or a vibrant painting in a cool, minimal living room. This type of balance and unexpected combinations feels very collected versus decorated. To me, understated luxury is achieved by adhering to design principles of perfect balance, juxtaposed scale, intriguing color and a multitude of textures.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love incorporating leather accents in unexpected ways, as leather adds a timeless and luxurious feel to a wide range of interior and furniture styles from traditional to very contemporary. The material itself also adds a visual depth to a space, which is hard to achieve with other finishes, but automatically feels refined and cohesive. Another consideration is to add some beautiful fabrics, such as linen or velvet to bring a subtle moment of luxury.\n\n\n\nMore: A Guide to Smart Eco-Friendly Gadgets\n\n\u201cAlong with exceptional fabrics, we look to marble and hardwood flooring to elevate designs in an understated way. Using real stone and true hardwood versus porcelain or laminate is such a nice way to infuse a subdued sense of extravagance into a design. Keeping finishes honed reduces the glam factor and also creates a feeling of understated luxury.\n\n\n\n\u201cI always strive to incorporate furniture thatmarries both beauty and functionality, especially in a living room where comfort is of the utmost importance and being able to truly relax is the ultimate luxury.\u201d\n\n\u2014Denise Morrison, founder & principal designer of Denise Morrison Interiors in Newport Beach, California\n\nA soft color palette in this living room puts the emphasis on elevated materials and furnishings by Ethan Allen. Courtesy of Ethan Allen\n\nCurate With Care\n\n\n\n\u201cAn understated room is one that welcomes you and invites you to \u2018please touch.\u201d Smooth satins and silky textiles are best.\n\n\n\n\u201cChoose neutrals that vary in feel\u2014pure wool for rugs, velvets for upholstery, dupioni silk for draperies\u2014to create a rich, cohesive look throughout.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThink beautiful, rich woods like sustainable mahogany for trim or crown molding; millwork can transform a simple box of a room into a striking architectural space. Hardwood flooring is always an excellent choice. But depending on the room, don\u2019t overlook marble, porcelain tile or even concrete polished to a sheen. Feel elegance underfoot by layering area rugs over broadloom.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore: Creating True Conversation Areas in Your Home\n\n\u201cAn understated room is one that looks and feels thoughtfully curated. That means every piece\u2013from a show-stopping leather sectional to the smallest decorative accent\u2013is considered in relation to the rest. Embrace craftsmanship and classic forms over trending styles. Remember that minimalism can be chic, so invest in well-made, practical pieces like bookcases, china cabinets and sideboards to help keep clutter at bay. Plush seating looks and feels luxurious, while glints of metal (whether paint or the real deal) add subtle drama to any elegant space.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014Donna Classi, Danbury, Connecticut-based design consultant at Ethan Allen\n\nMix and Match\n\n\n\n\u201cThe overall space should feel considered yet inviting. It\u2019s a fine line between having a thing of beauty that you want to use because it looks fabulous, rather than something you don\u2019t want to use because it\u2019s simply too precious and unapproachable.\n\n\u201cLayering, contrast, pattern and color are key. Any one element in isolation can look stark or harsh; it is the blending of these four elements that creates a luxurious yet approachable feel.\n\nA sophisticated chandelier is the focal point to this sophisticated space designed by Helena Lowry, director of Taylor Howes Designs. Courtesy of Taylor Howes Designs\n\n\"Layering doesn\u2019t just refer to the addition of throws or cushions. Having three different layers of lighting in a living room, such as decorative table lamps that create a soft evening glow, a central pendant or chandelier on a dimmer or additional spotlights around the room to highlight artwork or furnishings are keys to setting the right mood.\n\n\n\n\u201cUse color to accent and punctuate your scheme. For bolder spaces have no fear with vibrant patterns and colors, whether it\u2019s the curtains to provide an interesting backdrop or cushions and rugs to add vibrancy. When it comes to contrast, even the lightest of color schemes still requires that small punch of dark to ground the space, this could be the finish of chair legs in an ebony stain or a piping detail to an upholstered piece. Keep an even blend of elements to ensure it\u2019s not too matchy or staged.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Ryan Brant\u2019s Art Collection, Including Over 25 Works by KAWS, Heads to Auction\n\n\u201cA timbered floor will always look smart and timeless. Keep shiny, more polished finishes to metal accents in furniture and ironmongery, mirrors and accessories. Anything that can scratch easily like marble, metals or specialist materials, should not be on a surface that\u2019s likely to have lots of traffic.\n\n\u201cMixing furniture styles, old and new, creates a curated look without everything looking brand new and totally unusable. It also contributes to the layering aspect of a space and brings interest and depth.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014 Helena Lowry, Director, Taylor Howes Designs, London\n\n\n\nClick to read more news and stories about luxury home design", "description": "", "authors": ["Jennifer Tzeses"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-110245?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
