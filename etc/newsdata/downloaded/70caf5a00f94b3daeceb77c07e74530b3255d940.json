PSA stands for Professional Sports Authenticator, which apparently is a thing that exists.\n\n\u2018This is the only card in the long-running collectible card game series to say \u2018Illustrator\u2019 at the top of a Trainer Card, and the only one to bear the pen symbol in the bottom right corner\u2019, says the auction site.
