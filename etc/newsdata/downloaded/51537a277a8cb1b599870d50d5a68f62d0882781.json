The court statement says the businessman offered the hitman 2 million Chinese yuan (R4 million) for the job.\n\nXi Guangan took the money and allegedly contracted a second hitman, Mo Tianxiang, paying him 1 million yuan (R2 million) to kill Wei, the court says.\n\nThe court says the second hitman then hired another hitman, Yang Kangsheng, paying him 270,000 yuan (R560,000) up front and an additional 500,000 yuan (R1 million) when the deed was done.\n\nYang Kangsheng is alleged to have then offered a similar deal to a fourth hitman, Yang Guasheng, paying him 200,000 yuan (R415,000) up front and an additional 500,000 yuan (R1 million) after the job was complete.\n\nThe fourth hitman hired the fifth - and final - hitman, Ling Xiansi, who agreed to do the job for 100,000 yuan (R207,000), according to the reports. However, instead of going through with the murder, Ling Xiansi met with Wei and told him about the target on his back, offering the opportunity to fake Wei's death rather than actually killing him.\n\nThe fifth hitman helped Wei stage his death, Australia Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported. Wei was bound and gagged in photos, and Ling Xiansi sent the photos to his employer. The news traveled up the chain of subcontractors up to the original client, businessman Tan Youhui.\n\nHowever, after the photos of Wei were taken, the police were notified, according to ABC.\n\nTan Youhui, the real estate developer, was sentenced to five years in prison, while the five hitmen were sentenced between two to four years of prison time, according to CNN.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The job went through five hitmen before the fifth hitman struck a deal with the victim to fake his death instead of killing him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6043/7afc602d0d0d41bfa1e735638c1e1504.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
