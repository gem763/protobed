Can you explain this? It seemed such a good idea to freeze fruit now and make jam when I am less busy.\n\nHilde, West Sussex\n\nThe summer months are made for jam sessions, Hilde. But, while freezing is a good way to preserve the season, it all depends on the type and condition of the fruit you\u2019re using. \u201cJam is the hardest preserve to make, because it relies on a chemical reaction to get a set,\u201d says Kylee Newton, owner of Newton & Pott and author of The Modern Preserver. \u201cI would stick to freezing berries and rhubarb, and I wouldn\u2019t freeze citrus fruit as it\u2019s all just juice.\u201d If you\u2019re punting for apples, Newton blends the pulp before freezing.\n\nJam tastes best using freshly picked fruits that are not too ripe. \u201cFrozen fruit can be used very successfully,\u201d says Pam Corbin, author of Pam the Jam: The Book of Preserves, who recommends buying from britishfrozenfruits.co.uk. \u201cHowever, if the fruit is wet, or over-ripe, and then frozen, this may result in runny jam.\u201d\n\nFruit secured, do you defrost? This is where the camp splits: \u201cGenerally, you don\u2019t, and certainly not for raspberries, strawberries or soft-skinned fruits,\u201d Corbin says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to get the sugar on to them quickly so they hold their shape and to draw out the juices.\u201d Freezing, Corbin says, breaks down the skin tissue, so when it comes to gooseberries and plums, she heats them gently to soften the skins, while blackberries, raspberries, strawberries and apricots are left to macerate with sugar for half an hour. Newton does defrost, and advises against adding any extra water (frozen fruit retains enough), even if the recipe calls for it. If you\u2019re mixing fresh and frozen fruit, the bulk of it should be frozen. \u201cIf I want whole bits of fruit in my jam, I cook down the frozen fruit first, bring it to a nice, bubbly heat \u2013 making sure it\u2019s not sticking on the bottom \u2013 add the sugar, which should dissolve quickly, and then the unfrozen fruit.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to set your jam, it\u2019s most likely down to the cooking: \u201cIf you\u2019re getting a thick, syrupy mass, then you\u2019re cooking it for too long and missing the setting point,\u201d Corbin says. \u201cI would much prefer undercooked jam, because you can always redeem it by boiling for a couple more minutes.\u201d Besides opting for higher-pectin fruit, Corbin suggests (members of the WI, look away now) trying jam sugar, or a combination of jam and ordinary sugar. Her optimum temperature for setting is 104.5C. \u201cOnce you get there, the heat increases by the second, so err on the lower side: I always tell people that jam sets in the jar, not in the pan.\u201d Corbin uses the gel (or wrinkle) test: \u201cYou\u2019re looking for what I call a rhinoceros skin.\u201d If it reaches setting point in 30 seconds on the plate, you\u2019re there. The level of pectin in fruit becomes weaker over time, so Newton waits for the bubble change, from rolling boil to ploppy: \u201cAs the pectin reacts and wants to set, the bubbles find it harder to get through: At the beginning, you want to get that fast, rolling boil, then, as it gets heavier and ploppier, turn the heat off and do the wrinkle test.\u201d\n\nKeeping jam at a high temperature is key: \u201cIt gets spitty and nasty \u2013 it\u2019s like beekeeping: you\u2019re going to get stung.\u201d\n\nYou want to get to setting point as quickly as possible \u2013 the longer you leave it, the more likely the fruits will turn to sugars and become super-sweet. \u201cIt is a fine line,\u201d Newton warns. \u201cYou don\u2019t want it to stick to the bottom and burn, but you also don\u2019t want to stir it so much that a lot of air gets in and cools it down.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma?
