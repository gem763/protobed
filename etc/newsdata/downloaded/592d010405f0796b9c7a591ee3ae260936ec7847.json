A recent easing in trade tensions has helped the three main indexes recover from losses from August.\n\n\u201cThere has been slightly more constructiveness lately, but if there is any sort of agreement it will be a very light, mini-deal, because the U.S. and China are still very far apart on the main issues,\u201d warned Ben Phillips, chief investment officer at EventShares.\n\nThe S&P 500 healthcare index .SPXHC climbed 0.5% after U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a proposal on drug pricing policy.\n\nWhile the plan is a \u201cbig negative\u201d for drugmakers, the stock reaction has already been priced in to some degree, said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments.\n\nOf 11 sector indexes, healthcare is the worst performer so far in 2019, with a gain of 6%.\n\nExpectations of another rate cut by the Fed, following the U.S. central bank\u2019s 25-basis-point reduction on Wednesday, also drove sentiment. The Fed, in announcing its second quarter-percentage-point cut this year, said future reductions would be \u201clargely data-dependent.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nTraders see a nearly 50% chance for another 25 basis point rate cut in October, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\n\u201cThe market just continues to believe the Fed is going to be accommodative,\u201d said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.\n\nThe Fed injected another $75 billion into the U.S. banking system on Wednesday, restoring a measure of order after the central bank\u2019s benchmark interest rate rose above its targeted range for the first time since the financial crisis.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI declined 0.19% to end at 27,094.79 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC crept up 0.07% to 8,182.88. The S&P 500 .SPX stood at 3,006.79 points, up less than one point from Wednesday\n\nWith the S&P 500 up nearly 20% in 2019, the benchmark index is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, up from about 15 at the end of last year, according to Refinitiv\u2019s Datastream.\n\n\u201cCorporate earnings continue to expand, albeit at a slower pace, and we expect that to continue into 2020,\u201d said Bill Northey, senior investment director for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. \u201cWe view valuations as high but not extreme at this point. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s causing us to wring our hands.\u201d\n\nShares of Target Corp (TGT.N) rose 0.8% after the retailer announced a $5 billion share buyback plan.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.19-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.26-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. November 7, 2017.
