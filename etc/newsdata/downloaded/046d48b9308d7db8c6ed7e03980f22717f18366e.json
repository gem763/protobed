ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre\n\nThe recent haze in Malaysia has caused tensions with neighbouring Indonesia, with the two countries\u2019 environment ministers each accusing the other of shirking responsibility for the dusty air.\n\nEnvironment Minister Yeo Bee Yin first addressed the haze issue in a diplomatic note to Malaysia on Friday (Sept 6), Bernama reported.\n\nHer counterpart, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, then allegedly told local media it was a protest letter accusing Indonesia of causing the severe haze that has plagued Malaysia over the past week.\n\nIn a Facebook post, the Environment Minister said that up until Saturday (Sept 7), Indonesia had ascertained none of its haze had spread over to neighboring countries.\n\nKondisi gambaran hotspot hari ini sudah kira-kira sepertiga dari kondisi hotspot pada tanggal 4 dan 5 September. Telah\u2026 Posted by Siti Nurbaya Bakar on Saturday, 7 September 2019\n\nAs proof, she attached several screenshots from a forest and land fire monitoring app of Indonesia created by its National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN).\n\nThe app, which gets its data directly from several sources, including a thermal activity instrument housed on NASA satellites.\n\nHotspots in Indonesia as of Sept 12. LAPAN Catalog\n\nFour days later, Siti Nurbaya released an official statement saying haze from Kalimantan had indeed crossed into Malaysia, but for only one hour on Sept 8, local media reported.\n\nShe added that the haze Malaysia experienced could have come from Sarawak (which borders Kalimantan) and Peninsular Malaysia, as winds were also blowing from that direction.\n\n\u201cNot all smog is from Indonesia\u2026 the Malaysian government should have explained this objectively,\u201d The Guardian quoted her as saying. \u201cThere is information that they covered up.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Malaysian minister Yeo shot back at the claims with a Facebook post containing her own screenshots of hotspot-related information from the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre, an site created by the national meteorological agencies of ASEAN member states.\n\nThe site, which displays wind direction and hotspots across ASEAN, said in an update on Sept 11 that haze had been blown from Sumatra to Peninsular Malaysia, and from Kalimantan to adjacent areas in the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cHotspot activities in Sumatra and Kalimantan are likely to continue under the prevailing dry conditions, and smoke haze from the hotspots may affect parts of Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore and Sarawak,\u201d it added.\n\nAccording to Yeo\u2019s screenshots, there were seven hotspots in Sabah and Peninsula Malaysia, compared to 862 in Kalimantan and Sumatra.\n\nYeo added on Facebook that it was not \u201clogically possible\u201d for the haze to have originated from Sarawak as Siti Nurbaya claimed, due to the wind direction.\n\n\u201cLet the data speak for itself,\u201d she wrote, adding: \u201cMinister Siti Nurbaya should not be in denial\u201d.\n\nHotspots across Indonesia and Malaysia as of Sep 11.
