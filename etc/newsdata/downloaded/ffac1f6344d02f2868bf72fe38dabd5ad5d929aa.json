In the 2018 index of the global consumption of weed, Delhi appeared in third place while Mumbai came in at sixth.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Those from Delhi and Mumbai have been found to be huge pot fans, according to a study conducted by ABCD, a data-driven media campaign in Germany and Seedo, a company that offers hydroponic growing devices for consumers to grow their own medicinal herbs.\n\nThe index was topped by New York City, followed by Karachi, New Delhi, Los Angeles, Cairo, Mumbai, London, Chicago, Moscow, and Toronto.\n\nThe study found that pot-smokers in Delhi and Mumbai consumed 38.3 and 32.4 tons of weed, respectively.\n\nThe study also placed Amsterdam \u2014 where weed and \u201csoft drugs\u201d are legal for personal use \u2014 at 56th place, consuming 3.6 tons. This is just about a tenth of what Delhiites consumed.\n\nCheap prices may be a reason as to why cannabis consumption is so high in India. ABCD found that the average price in Delhi is USD$4.38 (Rs 315) per gram. In Mumbai, this number is $4.57 (Rs 329). The two cities feature the tenth and eleventh cheapest rates in the world, respectively, per gram.\n\nABCD pushes for the global legalisation of cannabis. To support their campaign, the 2018 index included the kind of tax revenue cities and countries could attain if they taxed weed the way they tax cigarettes. The results? Delhi could see an additional $101.2 million (approx Rs 725 crore) to its annual tax revenue. Similarly, Mumbai could raise $89.38 million (Rs 641 crores).\n\n\u201cBy removing the criminal element from marijuana, governments will then [be] able to more safely regulate production, take away power from underground gangs, and as we\u2019ve shown in this study, generate huge tax revenues,\u201d said Uri Zeevi, CMO at Seedo.\n\nIn 1985, the sale and production of cannabis resin and flowers were banned under India\u2019s Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. Prior to the criminalisation, weed was sold freely. But even though criminalised now, weed continues to be sold, purchased and consumed throughout the country \u2014 with major efforts towards legalising it ongoing as well.\n\nTo conduct the study, Seedo looked at the highest and lowest cannabis-consuming countries in the world. They then sectioned this off to where marijuana is illegal or not. The final list of 120 cities was selected as the best ones to provide a holistic view of global weed consumption.\n\nFind Meera on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "Amsterdam, where pot is legal, consumed just about a tenth of the cannabis Delhi did in 2018.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d7756fcdbc5d1000809f1e3/lede/1568102348723-ganja-smoking-india.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8460264900662252xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
