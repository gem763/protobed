There\u2019s a few protocols that they need to go through, so that\u2019s what we need to adhere to with the medical staff. But they are very happy. They are available, so we\u2019ve obviously another session to go on Friday. It\u2019s Wednesday. The game\u2019s on Sunday, so we\u2019re building nicely.\u201d\n\nWales attempt to steady ship after Rob Howley bombshell at Rugby World Cup Read more\n\nLeinster centre Robbie Henshaw will definitely miss Sunday\u2019s Pool A match due to his hamstring issue, but Ireland still hope he will be fit for the game against hosts Japan on 28 September.\n\nFarrell confirmed that Joey Carbery is fully fit, with the fly-half likely to take a seat on the bench against the Scots. \u201cJoey\u2019s been training well since Monday, so we\u2019re in a good spot,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cRobbie won\u2019t make this weekend, they are very happy with his progress but he will sit out this weekend and hopefully he will be available for next week. His progress has been great.\u201d\n\nIreland\u2019s clash with Scotland could well determine the entire outcome of Pool A, with the winners hoping they can push on and top the round-robin standings. Former dual code international Farrell admitted Ireland have trained with added \u201cbite\u201d this week, as they sharpen up for their biggest match in some time.\n\n\u201cIf you take for example this week, which is the week that matters, there\u2019s certainly a feel that\u2019s brewing of major importance to the squad,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cThe intensity, the bite that\u2019s in training is very significant, and there\u2019s a completely different feel. So I suppose that\u2019s a culmination of what\u2019s happened over the last couple of months.\u201d\n\nFor Scotland, Stuart Hogg has already suffered a case of mistaken identity in Japan, but he has no trouble recognising the threat facing his side on Sunday. The Exeter full-back is among the biggest names in Gregor Townsend\u2019s squad yet he has found himself in former skipper Greig Laidlaw\u2019s shade since touching down.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stuart Hogg poses for a portrait during the Scotland squad photo call.

But Hogg\u2019s reputation as one of the game\u2019s most thrilling attackers has apparently failed to stick in the minds of the Japanese public after he was first confused by a fan with stand-off Finn Russell \u2013 then more alarmingly with prop WP Nel.\n\nHogg \u2013 who will earn his 70th cap if he features against Joe Schmidt\u2019s men in Yokohama this weekend \u2013 explained: \u201cMr Greig is a hero wherever he goes. It\u2019s been great to see. There has been a lot of support for Greig and for the Scotland team in general. We\u2019ve had some fun with him. Anytime we\u2019re walking through shopping malls we shout \u2018Mr Greig\u2019 when he walks in front. Everyone then turns around and mobs him. It\u2019s been good fun.\n\n\u201cAlthough there have been a couple of things I have been disappointed with. I was standing in the hotel the other night and someone approached me with a poster to sign. Just as I took the pen he asked me if I was Finn Russell. I thought that would be the end of it and said: \u2018No, I\u2019m not Mr Russell.\u2019 The guy looked at his sheet again and WP Nel came next. I think it must have been the haircut.\u201d", "description": "Andy Farrell has declared Rob Kearney and Keith Earls available for Ireland\u2019s World Cup opener against Scotland on Sunday", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46b7614a69130fa982aafdd79e464a044dcb545e/79_84_5296_3179/master/5296.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=989012d4b2a95d9beca624aafc25da8f", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
