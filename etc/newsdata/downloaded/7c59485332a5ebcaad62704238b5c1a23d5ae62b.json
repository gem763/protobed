That\u2019s all, though.\n\n\u201cIf I want to wear it, I\u2019ll wear it,\u201d he said.\n\nBeckham said Thursday that he intends to keep sporting the $200,000 Richard Mille watch that the star receiver had on during his debut for the Browns on Sunday.\n\nThe three-time Pro Bowler\u2019s fashion accessory came under scrutiny from the NFL, which has a policy against wearing \u201chard objects\u201d on the field. Beckham contends his time piece should be permissible since it\u2019s plastic, and the only reason the watch is an issue is because he\u2019s wearing it.\n\nBeckham feels he\u2019s being picked on.\n\n\u201cIf I wear pink laces and it\u2019s not breast cancer month, it would probably be talked about,\u201d he said. \u201cWith me I know what it is, people just need something to talk about. I have a completely different mentality, different take on where I\u2019m at in my life. I came here to play football. I don\u2019t talk about anything else but football. If anybody wants to talk about how I did, how I produced individually on the field or how I didn\u2019t produce, or how the team lost or whatever it is, we can talk about that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love for people to talk about me as a football player. I\u2019d love for them to say I\u2019m not a good football player or things like that. I would love to - you show me those facts. But other than that, I\u2019m not talking about unnecessary stuff that people are mad about, it doesn\u2019t bother me, I\u2019m not losing no sleep over it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Odell Beckham Jr. said he's done talking about his controversial watch.
