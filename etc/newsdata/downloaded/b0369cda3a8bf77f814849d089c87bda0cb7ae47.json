He had been an MP for the Orpington constituency in Kent, south east England, since 2010, serving in several ministerial roles.\n\nBoris Johnson's \"do or die\" Brexit strategy, and his hardline approach to enforcing it, is causing a realignment in the ruling party, with several senior, more pro-European members announcing they will not seek re-election.\n\nThe Johnson family itself is notoriously split over Brexit with his sister Rachel having represented different parties opposed to Brexit, and his father Stanley being a committed europhile and former European Commission official.\n\nIt is also not the first time Jo Johnson, a former Financial Times journalist and a much less flamboyant character than his brother, has caught the government by surprise with a resignation notice.\n\nLast year, he quit then-prime minister Theresa May's government, calling in a withering critique for another referendum to avoid her Brexit plans unleashing Britain's greatest crisis since World War Two.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's brother, Jo, has resigned as junior minister and said he would step down as a lawmaker, citing a conflict between family loyalty and the national interest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106113204-1567679890317gettyimages-1157122894.jpg?v=1567679941", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
