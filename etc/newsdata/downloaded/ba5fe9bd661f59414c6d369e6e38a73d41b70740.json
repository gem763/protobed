All 140 seats are on the Nov. 5 ballot.\n\nPoll finds Virginia voters focused on gun policy ahead of pivotal election\n\nVoters sided with Democrats on a range of issues on the front burner in Richmond this year, including gun control, with 83 percent saying they would be more likely to support a candidate who favors requiring background checks for all gun purchases and 67 percent saying the same aboutbanning assault weapons.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeventy-six percent said they would be more likely to vote for someone who supports ratifying the federal Equal Rights Amendment, while 66 percent said they would be inclined to back a candidate who supports a $15 minimum wage.\n\nBut the poll showed markedly little appetite for the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d healthcare plan embraced nationally by some leading Democratic 2020 presidential contenders. Fewer than 4 in 10, 36 percent, of likely voters said support for that plan would make them more likely to vote for a candidate, and 50 percent said it would turn them off.\n\nOther national political factors \u2013 President Trump chief among them \u2013 seemed to be working against Republicans. Trump\u2019s low marks in the survey \u2013 37 percent approve of the job he\u2019s doing -- has potential to spill over to state legislative candidates. Fifty-nine percent of voters said they would be less likely to vote for someone who supports the president, while 37 percent said they would be more likely.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVirginia\u2019s \u201coff-off\u201d year elections were sleepy. And then came Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that national politics are on the minds of Virginia voters this fall,\u201d said Quentin Kidd, the Wason Center\u2019s director. \u201cLike or not, there\u2019s no way for state legislative candidates to run in a vacuum -- their national party brands influence their fortunes.\u201d\n\nMost of the survey was conducted before the release of detailed notes of a July call between Trump and Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump urged Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nVoters were more closely split on the subject of impeachment. Less than half (49 percent) said they were more likely to vote for a candidate who supports impeachment while 44 percent said they were less likely. Recent national polls have shown Americans split about evenly on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTurnout for Virginia\u2019s \u201coff-off year\u201d elections, when there is no statewide contest on the ballot, typically favors Republicans. But Christopher Newport pollsters see indications that the anti-Trump backlash that drove up Democratic turnout over the past two years has not subsided.\n\nThey note that, among likely voters, 62 percent of Democrats say they are \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about voting in the election, compared to 49 percent for both Republicans and independents. They also found a 10-point advantage for Democrats who say they will \u201cdefinitely\u201d vote (84 percent of Democrats, compared to 74 percent of Republicans).\n\nThe poll found Democrats held a 13-point advantage of the \u201cgeneric ballot\u201d question, which asks voters if they will support the Republicans or Democrats running for the legislature.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGiven the significant interest and enthusiasm gaps measured in this survey, we expect some version of the Trump Bump to manifest in the 2019 Virginia state legislative elections,\u201d said Rachel Bitecofer, the Wason Center\u2019s elections analyst.\n\nA Washington Post-Schar School poll released last week showed Democrats with only a slight edge in certainty to vote. That poll found that Virginia registered voters narrowly prefer Democrats over Republicans, 49 percent to 42 percent. That edge widens slightly among those who say they are certain to vote, who prefer Democrats 52 percent to 41 percent.\n\nThe Christopher Newport University survey was conducted among a sample of 726 likely voters in Virginia\u2019s General Assembly election this November, including 67 percent reached on cellphones and 33 percent on landlines. The margin of sampling error for overall results is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.\n\nScott Clement contributed to this report.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "Survey finds strong support for Democratic positions on guns, minimum wage and ERA.", "authors": ["Laura Vozzella", "Local Reporter Covering Virginia Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YkFF6WWrwL58ZrdQWH4qQaTYMVM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BIGCDERQSMI6TAJ2BKZPC7RQLM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
