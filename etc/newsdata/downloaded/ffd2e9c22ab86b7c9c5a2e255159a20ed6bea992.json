We had a Premier League meeting at the beginning of the season and the worst they can get is a yellow card.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"How\u2019s that going to stop it? That ain\u2019t going to stop it.\n\nDyche added: \"It\u2019s not a reflection of the game or the scoreline - Chelsea were too good for us tonight.\n\n\"That\u2019s got to go out of the game. It\u2019s ridiculous now.\n\n\"Young players, young players diving - I just can\u2019t stand it.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"It\u2019s shambolic how people dive about the place. I keep hearing the word respect, and I get shot down for saying this, I sit there amazed \u2013 respect the game.\n\n\"That is what people should be doing.\"\n\nDyche previously had a go at Arsenal about diving following his side's 2-1 defeat at the Emirates in August.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nThe Burnley boss said after that game: \"It\u2019s not encouraging for the game of football - I\u2019m really worried for the game of football.\n\n\"People diving all over the place today \u2013 it has to go.\n\n\"The maximum you can get for a dive is a yellow card. So for every player in the Premier League they can cheat at least once a game and get nothing other than a yellow.\"", "description": "Dyche called for tougher punishments after Hudson-Odoi was booked for simulation in Chelsea's 4-2 win at Turf Moor", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Pa", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20734165.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Burnley-v-Chelsea-Premier-League-Turf-Moor.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
