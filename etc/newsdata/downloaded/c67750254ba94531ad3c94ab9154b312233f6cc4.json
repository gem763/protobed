Its physical science programme is the only one that runs all year round. The others, which include Earth, life, and oceanographic sciences, run during the summer months when temperatures and weather allow.\n\nHowever, the volunteers will be part of Sansa\u2019s space science unit, which \u201cforms part of the worldwide network of magnetic observatories, monitors and models variations of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, and carries out physics research\u201d.\n\nSuccessful applicants need to be physically and mentally strong, according to the advert. Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth, and while the team will be there in summer, the warmest temperature recorded in Antarctica to date is 15 degrees Celsius. But candidates also have to be mentally strong to cope with the extreme isolation.\n\nThe three positions are unpaid, but Sansa will cover the volunteers' costs while they are part of the trip.\n\nFor your average tourist, a trip to Earth\u2019s southern-most continent can be very pricey. According to travel website Antarctica Guide, a budget cruise will set you back about the equivalent of about R140,000, while a luxury option will cost around R380,000. Travel group Aurora Expeditions offers a complete Antarctic adventure for 23-days from around R340,000 per person sharing.\n\nThat comes with a free jacket.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "South African National Space Agency (Sansa) wants three volunteers with some science or engineering experience \u2013\u00a0and physical and mental strength \u2013\u00a0to go to Antarctica.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9365/f2261a08c30a4fb9b4406efb47f08c4a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
