Traveling in a fleet of pick-ups with about 15 men in each truck, they are dressed in pixelated camouflage uniforms and ballistic vests and at first glance they look like official army units, but their weapons give them away. Many of these commandos carry AK-47 model assault rifles, which aren\u2019t used by the Mexican armed forces.\n\nThe logo stamped on the doors of the trucks shows a figure from the Mexican Revolution wearing a sombrero and brandishing a rifle astride a charging horse. Below that are the words Policia Comunitaria, or community police, and a phrase which, roughly translated from Spanish, reads: \u201cDeath before surrender or humiliation.\u201d\n\nThe men in the trucks are members of the United Front of Community Police of Guerrero State, better known by its Spanish acronym of FUPCEG. Tonight FUPCEG\u2019s shock troops are on their way to assault the nearby town of El Naranjo, which is currently held by the forces of an organized crime group called the Cartel del Sur.\n\n\u201cWe fight to free communities that have been isolated by the criminals,\u201d says a squad leader who asks to be identified only as \u201cEl Burro\u201d in an interview with The Daily Beast. \u201cEveryone has a right to security. And to economic freedom. Campesinos [small farmers] and their children shouldn\u2019t suffer under the rule of bandits,\u201d Burro says. \u201cThe people of this town have asked us for help, and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\n\u201c One alliance of civilian self-defense groups boasts about 11,700 fighters. \u201d\n\nEl Burro says he got his nickname, which means \u201cthe donkey,\u201d because he can bear heavy loads a great distance despite his slight stature. In his backpack he carries several cans of tuna and crackers and canteens of water. His battle harness holds some 300 rounds of ammunition for his AK-47.\n\nLater tonight he\u2019ll lead his squad on foot through the dense pine forests that surround El Naranjo, until they reach the pre-assigned rendezvous point. From there the coordinated strike force will crawl on their bellies until they\u2019re in sight of the cartel stronghold, then wait for dawn to attack.\n\n\u201c Will my family understand what I died for? \u201d \u2014 \u2018El Burro\u2019\n\nBurro is a veteran of a dozen such engagements with the comunitarios and says he\u2019s personally registered 20 confirmed kills of sicarios, the cartels\u2019 contract killers. A former farmer, he joined the movement \u201cbecause I was tired of hearing the people\u2019s cries for help go unanswered.\u201d\n\nThe Cartel del Sur is known for its brutal tactics, including torturing prisoners, and for that reason Burro says he prefers death on the battlefield to being captured by los contras , as he calls members of the Cartel del Sur.\n\n\u201cWill I come back from where I go tonight?\u201d he asks rhetorically. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t,\u201d he says, \u201cwill my family understand what I died for?\u201d\n\n\u2018We Have To Protect Ourselves\u2019\n\nFUPCEG is an alliance of civilian autodefensas , or self-defense groups, that boasts about 11,700 fighters across 39 municipalities in Guerrero, meaning they\u2019re now present in about half the state. Similar communitario movements have sprung up across Mexico over the last decade, but FUPCEG is by far the largest of its kind.\n\nThe spike in vigilante militias has polarized public opinion. Some observers see them as noble freedom fighters who succeed where traditional law enforcement has failed. Critics claim the autodefensas and comunitarios (the words are often used interchangeably in Mexico) are at best undisciplined mobs and at worst cartel patsies who do the criminals\u2019 grunt work for them.\n\nEither way, their power is growing. A new study by Mexico\u2019s National Human Rights Commission suggests vigilante activity is up by more than 300 percent since the start of 2018, and blames the increase on \u201cinsecurity, violence, and impunity.\u201d\n\nIn fact, violence in Mexico has reached historic levels this year, with the country averaging an all-time high of 94 killings a day through the first half of 2019. Both 2017 and 2018 also broke previous murder records. As one autodefensa fighter put it, repeating what has become a kind of mantra, \"If the government can't protect us, then we have no choice left but to protect ourselves.\"\n\nFUPCEG\u2019s founder and leader is 40-year-old Salvador Alanis. A Guerrero native, Alanis is something of a polymath. An economist by training, he\u2019s also worked as an electrical engineer in North Carolina, and at one time owned several successful fruit and cattle ranches in his home state. Those ranches are gone now. Some were sold off to help fund Alanis\u2019s crime-fighting endeavors, while others have been seized by the mafia groups he opposes.\n\n\u201cI spent 12 years working in the U.S.,\u201d Alanis says during an interview in the FUPCEG base in the strategically vital town of Filo de Caballos, high in the sierra of central Guerrero. \u201cIn the States I came to know a better life, a better world. I came to take safety for granted,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there\u2019s no security like that in Mexico.\u201d\n\n\u201c The last president sent 5,000 soldiers and they couldn\u2019t do anything against the cartels, because the criminals just paid them off. Everyone has a price. \u201d \u2014 Salvador Alanis\n\nThe lack of security is even more pronounced in Guerrero, which is Mexico\u2019s leading exporter of opium and heroin, and perennially listed as one of the country\u2019s most dangerous and politically corrupt regions. It doesn\u2019t help that government law enforcement here is undermanned.\n\n\u201cWe have an insufficient number of police officers to go around,\u201d says Roberto \u00c1lvarez Heredia, the state\u2019s security spokesperson. \u201cWe need about three times as many cops and public prosecutors as we have,\u201d he says, \u201cand the ones we do have need better salaries.\u201d\n\nRecently elected President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, known as AMLO, has touted his newly created Guardia Nacional as a solution to peacekeeping efforts in places like Guerrero, but Alanis remains unimpressed:\n\n\u201cSo they just sent 3,500 Guardias to Guerrero,\u201d he says, when asked about the new policing initiative. \u201cThe last president sent 5,000 soldiers and they couldn\u2019t do anything against the cartels, because the criminals just paid them off. Everyone has a price,\u201d he adds.\n\nStill, Alanis is willing to give the Guardia a chance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to let them in [to our territory] and see if they behave themselves. See if they\u2019re corrupt, or if they abuse their power. In the past the soldiers used to enter and search any house they pleased, and that\u2019s why we had to run them out. We\u2019re glad to be friends [with the Guardia], but we won\u2019t be their slaves.\u201d\n\nA Question of War\n\nAs protection against a cartel counter thrust, FUPCEG troops man fortified checkpoints at regular intervals all along State Road 196. Here in Filo, Alanis and his command crew are headquartered in what used to be the largest hotel in town. The long, two-story building was abandoned when FUPCEG occupied Filo after a prolonged firefight back in November of 2018. Pocked by bullet holes inside and out, the building no longer has running water, and electricity is intermittent, but the community kitchen in the lobby is always full of gossip and the smell of spicy cooking.\n\nDuring this interview, Alanis sits in what was once the hotel\u2019s main office. He\u2019s stockily built, dressed in a sky-blue Oxford shirt left open at the throat and wearing square-rimmed photochromic glasses. Clear mountain sunshine drifts in through the shot-up windows. In one corner of the room stands a derelict arcade game titled, coincidentally enough, Streetfighter II.\n\nWhen he came back in 2010, Alanis says he found his home town of Ocotito overrun by organized crime.\n\n\u201cMurder, kidnapping, extortion, theft. The cartels ruled the state and they\u2019d packed the government and police forces with corrupt officials, so there was no one to challenge them,\u201d he says. After surviving two kidnapping attempts, Alanis decided to take matters into his own hands to \u201crestore justice\u201d to Guerrero.\n\nAt first it was just himself and a handful of other ranchers, but slowly the movement gathered support. By 2015 their forces numbered several hundred comunitarios operating out of a string of liberated communities around the state capital of Chilpancingo. But he\u2019d made a number of powerful enemies in the process, including capos from the Rojos, Tequileros, and Guerreros Unidos cartels. When those crime groups launched a series of counter-attacks aimed at taking back the newly freed townships, Alanis\u2019 civilian militias were quickly overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWe had an army of shop owners and farm workers,\u201d he says in the office of the ramshackle hotel. He unholsters a chrome-plated 10 mm pistol to make himself more comfortable and sets it on the desk before him.\n\n\u201cMany of our men didn\u2019t really know how to use their weapons. Meanwhile, we were facing off against experienced and well-armed sicarios , and we couldn\u2019t beat them in battle. It was a question of war, and we weren\u2019t up to the task. We were weak and lacking strategy.\u201d\n\nThose factors\u2014along with the defection of some of his most trusted officers, one of whom ran off with his wife\u2014combined to spell defeat for Alanis. His forces scattered and, still hunted by the cartels, he fled to the mountains and went into hiding.\n\n\u201cThey took everything from him,\u201d says Jackie P\u00e9rez, an independent journalist based in Chilpancingo, and an expert on the state\u2019s autodefensa groups. \u201cSalvador lost his livestock, his farmland, even his wife,\u201d she says. \u201cBut he\u2019s very intelligent and very patient. He was able to persevere, and come back stronger than ever.\u201d\n\nP\u00e9rez goes on to compare Alanis to Mexican freedom fighters of the past like Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa, at least in terms of tactics. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to overthrow the government,\u201d she says. \u201cBut he is willing to go outside the system to fight for the people\u2019s right to freedom from certain forms of oppression.\u201d\n\nIn order to continue that fight after being drubbed by the contras , Alanis knew he\u2019d have to change his game plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d been outnumbered and defeated,\u201d he says. \u201cNow it was time to change strategies.\u201d Part of that strategic shift involved developing a broad network of spies and informants, many of them women, to keep him informed of his enemies\u2019 movements and activities.\n\n\u201cKnow your enemy as you know yourself,\u201d he quotes Sun Tzu from memory, \u201cand in a hundred battles you will never be defeated.\u201d\n\nControlling The Sierra\n\nAlanis isn\u2019t the first comunitario leader forced to revamp his approach after an initial setback. Many other grassroots vigilante groups have cropped up in Mexico to oppose organized crime, only to find they lack the manpower and budget to keep up the fight over time. Unfortunately, that often leads to alliances with well-heeled drug lords, who then use the militias as proxy groups to wage war on their rivals.\n\nGuerrero expert Chris Kyle, a professor of anthropology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, says that pattern has been in play for years.\n\n\u201cSince 2013 there\u2019s been an explosion of community policing groups in Guerrero,\u201d says Kyle in a phone interview with The Daily Beast. While villages with native indigenous populations that pre-date the Spanish conquest are legally allowed to form such units under Mexico\u2019s constitution, the proliferation of non-indigenous figures \u201cclaiming to be community police has baffled authorities.\u201d\n\nThe swift spread of the comunitarios is related directly to a lack of effective security measures, according to Kyle.\n\n\u201cIf the state would provide security, many of these groups would likely stand down,\u201d he says. In the absence of state power, however, and due to a lack of sufficient resources to operate long-term on their own, many vigilante squads become co-opted.\n\n\u201cThe drug trafficking organizations take advantage of them,\u201d Kyle says, because the community police provide the cartels with \u201ca semi-legitimate wing that extends their reach.\u201d\n\nAlanis\u2019s FUPCEG umbrella group includes both indigenous and mestizo, or mixed race, cells from all over the state, including the Regional Coordinator for Community Authorities (CRAC), the oldest and most respected such organization in Mexico.\n\nEven so, Alanis admits that part of his revised strategy involved aligning with certain deep-pocketed backers. He claims that instead of working on behalf of a crime syndicate, he\u2019s merely defending free enterprise.\n\nThis may strike drug enforcement authorities in the United States as a distinction without a difference, but here in Guerrero such distinctions matter.\n\nAlanis says that in fact he is not opposed to campesinos growing poppies, since that's the only crop that pays enough to support many families in the sierra. What he's opposed to, as he puts it, is how the Cartel del Sur seeks to drive out competitors, keep prices low, and control poppy farmers through violence and intimidation.\n\n\"The people should be able to grow [poppies] if they want to. Or not, as they see fit. That's up to them. But nobody should be forced to sell [opium gum] at an unfair price to a single buyer. Nobody should be threatened or forced to worry about their family\u2019s safety. All we want is for the people to live in peace,\u201d he says, back in his bullet-riddled HQ.\n\n\u201cThe Cartel del Sur wants to control the whole sierra,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey want to own a monopoly on poppy gum and heroin production, and also extort from shop owners, taxi drivers, you name it. Other businessmen I know want an open market for poppies up here, and they understand that requires healthy local economies. So that\u2019s why they help us fight the contras .\u201d\n\nTo launch a full-scale assault like the one that liberated Filo would be impossible without outside financial support, according to Alanis. The Filo battle involved some 3,000 comunitarios and hundreds of trucks to ferry them, he explains. When the cost of ammunition, gas, and fighters\u2019 salaries are factored in, a single campaign can cost about 300,000 pesos [about $15,700] per hour. And the Filo firefight alone last for more than seven hours.\n\n\u201cWe need their help,\u201d he says, referring to those independent opium gum buyers who help fund FUPCEG\u2019s efforts, \u201cbut they need us too . If part of the money to liberate the people must come from opium, I\u2019m willing to accept that equation,\u201d the economist by training says.\n\nTerrorizing The Resistance\n\nDuring a series of independent interviews conducted in Filo de Caballos and surrounding communities it becomes clear that, prior to liberation by Alanis and his cohorts, local citizens had suffered greatly under rule by the Cartel del Sur.\n\nRun by Isaac Navarette Celis, one of Mexico\u2019s most wanted men, the Cartel del Sur specializes in the production and northbound transport of China White, a particularly potent form of heroin. Navarette is a relative newcomer to Guerrero\u2019s populous criminal underworld, first announcing his arrival back in 2016. Younger drug lords like Navarette often are especially bloodthirsty as they attempt to carve out a competitive niche against established rivals.\n\nResidents in the swath of towns and villages formerly under Navarette\u2019s control describe a reign of terror that included kidnappings for ransom, forcing young people to work as sicarios under threat of death, mass killings, crippling extortion rates, and random violence that caused schools, clinics, and small businesses to be shuttered indefinitely.\n\n\u201cWe denounced the criminals to the police many times but they never did anything to help us,\u201d says Reina Maldonado, 53. Maldonado was married to the comisario , or sheriff, of a village called Corralitos. Last June several sicarios from the Cartel del Sur kidnapped Reina\u2019s husband from their home and brought him to a local safehouse.\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t back down from them. He defied their orders and bribes, so they took him,\u201d she said. When Maldonado\u2019s husband\u2019s body was found, she explains, he showed signs of having been tortured and had been shot multiple times.\n\n\u201cThey killed him to terrorize the village against resistance,\u201d the sheriff's widow says, \u201cbut that didn\u2019t work.\u201d Hours after the comisario was reported missing, Alanis arrived with hundreds of comandos to battle it out with those responsible for his murder. Four cartel members were killed in the ensuing firefight, and the rest fled in armored vehicles. According to Maldonado, they haven\u2019t been back to Corralitos since.\n\n\u201cLife here is much better now,\u201d she says, as she walks around the ruins of the house where her husband\u2019s body was found. Many of the families that had fled Corralitos under cartel rule have since returned, and the shops and fruit stands that line the small main street are again open for business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still poor,\u201d Maldonado says, \u201cbut at least now we\u2019re safe.\u201d\n\nGovernment Silence\n\nRuperto Pacheco Vega, 44, the mayor of Filo de Caballo, agrees with Maldonado\u2019s assessment:\n\n\u201cMany businesses were completely shut down under [Navarette\u2019s] cartel,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was no commerce, nobody could move. The store owners couldn\u2019t make a profit due to extortion, and many people were out of work.\u201d\n\nEven worse, Vega says, was the cartel\u2019s habit of impressing young men into its service. \u201cThey wanted our boys to join them, put on their colors, and fight against Salvador and the comunitarios. \u201d To decline the cartel\u2019s \u201cinvitation,\u201d he says, was punishable by death.\n\nIn contrast, the mayor explains that Alanis has helped local communities diversify their economies. The financial backbone of the region has long been poppy cultivation to produce opium gum to sell to the cartels to make heroin. But a recent drop in the price of heroin (apparently due to U.S. users preferring synthetic opioids like Fentanyl) has caused a backlash among growers.\n\nAccording to Vega, Alanis has been instrumental in helping the farmers develop detailed crop substitution plans in order to replace illicit poppy plots with legal alternatives like avocado, peaches, pears, and lemons.\n\n\u201cThe government says we mustn\u2019t grow poppies, and that\u2019s fine with us. So we sent them precise and detailed petitions asking for basic subsidies until the [fruit] trees reach maturity,\u201d says Vega, riffing through signed and stamped copies of the official documents addressed to various politicians in Mexico City, including President L\u00f3pez Obrador.\n\nAs with local authorities who ignore cartel malfeasance, it seems the bid for federal assistance to produce legal crops has also fallen on deaf ears.\n\n\u201cTheir offices acknowledged receipt of our requests,\u201d Vega says, \u201cbut we never heard anything back from them.\u201d\n\nA Question Of Ethics\n\nFor all the careful planning put into it, El Burro\u2019s assault on the cartel-held town of El Naranjo didn\u2019t go as expected.\n\n\u201cSomebody must\u2019ve talked because they were waiting for us,\u201d says El Burro, in the aftermath of the failed offensive. \u201cThey had a damned mortar and belt-fed machine guns. We killed a few of them but we then we had to pull back.\u201d\n\nNow rumors are swirling around town that Navarette\u2019s men are planning a counter-attack to retake Filo. Comunitarios run in and out of the lobby of the bombed-out hotel, fetching weapons and ammunition from stockpiles in the armory. Meanwhile Alanis sits surrounded by cell phones and a half-dozen radios, diligently coordinating with units in the field and his mysterious financial backers.\n\nIn answer to a question about the ethics of his current line of work, Alanis waxes philosophical.\n\n\u201cI used to have a different idea about ethics,\u201d he says, putting down his phone. \u201cI never accepted any drug money back when I first began to oppose [the cartels].\u201d But, he adds, that\u2019s also why he lost the first time around.\n\n\u201cYou see suffering like this,\u201d and he waves his hand as if to take in the whole sierra: \u201cYou see people without work. People without health care. Children starving. Kids with no future. And you ask me about ethics?\u201d\n\nIn Alanis\u2019s estimation, \u201cOur worst enemy is the state, due to their alliance with organized crime. There is no democracy in Guerrero\u201d because the cartels \u201crig elections\u201d and \u201ccontrol the politicians,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe came up with a plan to eliminate 65 percent of the poppy plants in our territories and replace them with legal orchards, but the politicians never even answered our letters.\u201d Alanis picks up his phone again.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask them about ethics?\u201d he says.", "description": "Locals love to be liberated from the savage rule of organized crime, but who\u2019s footing the bill for these cartel wars?", "authors": ["Jeremy Kryt"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1563570303/190719-Kryt-vigilantes-tease_lprnpb", "published_at": "2019-07-21"}
