That\u2019s because recently, the Giants have faded into irrelevance.\n\nThey\u2019re 0-2 to start this season, and they\u2019ve made the playoffs just once in the previous seven years. These lean seasons created a palpable tension for the fan base: the same player who won two Super Bowl MVPs slowly became their object of resentment as the team continually balked at replacing him.\n\n\u201cEli was obviously disappointed,\u201d Giants coach Pat Shurmur said through the team. \u201cUltimately, this is a move that I felt was best for this team at this time.\u201d Once before, the Giants dabbled in this\u2014and bungled it. Back in 2017, when the Giants were 2-9 and one of the biggest disappointments in the league that season, they placed former Jets castoff Geno Smith in the lineup for Manning, which ended his run of starting 210 regular-season games. That was the second longest streak in NFL history for a quarterback. That didn\u2019t go so well. Smith lasted one game, which he lost, and then-coach Ben McAdoo was fired. Manning returned to the starting lineup, and started every game in 2018, with the team finishing 5-11 and last in the NFC East for the second straight year.

They took Jones early in the last draft after years of avoiding taking a quarterback that early. In 2018, they faced criticism for passing on various quarterbacks to take running back Saquon Barkley with the No. 2 pick. Despite Barkley\u2019s overwhelming abilities, the pick became a lightning rod as they passed on a prime opportunity to take a top talent at the most important position in football. There\u2019s also an elegance to this transition. Jones played at Duke under coach David Cutcliffe, who coached Eli Manning at Ole Miss. Cutcliffe was also Peyton Manning\u2019s offensive coordinator at Tennessee and remains a confidante of their family: Eli Manning has routinely gone down to North Carolina to train with Cutcliffe. The move also sets up to potentially save Manning\u2019s legacy in one key way: his career record is 116-116. That means if Manning\u2019s career as a starter is finished, he doesn\u2019t face the prospect of ending his career with a losing record.
