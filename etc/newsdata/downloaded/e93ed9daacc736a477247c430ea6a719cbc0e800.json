That has stopped.\n\n\n\nThose same partners, the Syrian Democratic Forces, had also been quietly releasing some Islamic State prisoners and incorporating them into their ranks, in part as a way to keep them under watch. That, too, is now in jeopardy.\n\nAnd across Syria\u2019s porous border with Iraq, Islamic State fighters are conducting a campaign of assassination against local village headmen, in part to intimidate government informants.\n\nWhen President Trump announced this month that he would pull American troops out of northern Syria and make way for a Turkish attack on the Kurds, Washington\u2019s onetime allies, many warned that he was removing the spearhead of the campaign to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n\nNow, analysts say that Mr. Trump\u2019s pullout has handed the Islamic State its biggest win in more than four years and greatly improved its prospects. With American forces rushing for the exits, in fact, American officials said last week that they were already losing their ability to collect critical intelligence about the group\u2019s operations on the ground.\n\n\u00a9 Hadi Mizban/Associated Press Syrian Democratic Forces standing guard at the Syrian border with Iraq on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that ISIS is one of the big winners in what is happening in Syria,\u201d said Lina Khatib, director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, a research center in London.\n\nCutting support for the Syrian Democratic Forces has crippled the ability of the United States and its former partners to hunt down the group\u2019s remnants.\n\nNews of the American withdrawal set off jubilation among Islamic State supporters on social media and encrypted chat networks. It has lifted the morale of fighters in affiliates as far away as Libya and Nigeria.\n\nAnd, by removing a critical counterforce, the pullout has eased the re-emergence of the Islamic State\u2019s core as a terrorist network or a more conventional, and potentially long-lasting, insurgency based in Syria and Iraq.\n\nAlthough Mr. Trump has repeatedly declared victory over the Islamic State \u2014 even boasting to congressional leaders last week that he had personally \u201ccaptured ISIS\u201d \u2014 it remains a threat. After the loss in March of the last patch of the territory it once held across Syria and Iraq, the Islamic State dispersed its supporters and fighters to blend in with the larger population or to hide out in remote deserts and mountains.\n\n\u00a9 Ivor Prickett for The New York Times Women and children who fled ISIS\u2019s last areas of control at a detention camp in eastern Syria in March.\n\nThe group retains as many as 18,000 \u201cmembers\u201d in Iraq and Syria, including up to 3,000 foreigners, according to estimates cited in a recent Pentagon report. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed caliph, is still at large.\n\n\u201cOur battle today is one of attrition and stretching the enemy,\u201d Mr. al-Baghdadi declared in a video message released in April. Looking comfortable and well fed, he sat on the floor of a bare room, surrounded by fighters, with an assault rifle by his side.\n\n\u201cJihad is ongoing until the day of judgment,\u201d he told his supporters, according to a transcript provided by SITE Intelligence Group.\n\n\u00a9 Delil Souleiman/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Members of the Syrian Democratic Forces prepared to face Turkish forces last week in northern Syria.\n\nAgainst the benchmark of the Islamic State\u2019s former grip on a broad swath of geography, any possibility of a comeback to that extent remains highly remote.\n\nChanges in the political context in Syria and Iraq have diminished the Islamic State\u2019s ability to whip up sectarian animosity out of the frustrations of Sunni Muslims over the Shiite or Shiite-linked authorities in Syria and Iraq \u2014 the militants\u2019 trademark.\n\nThe government in Baghdad has broadened its support among Sunni Iraqis. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, by crushing the revolt against him, has left Sunni militants less space to mobilize. And many Syrians and Iraqis who lived under the harsh dominion of the Islamic State strongly oppose its return.\n\nBut as an underground insurgency, the Islamic State appears to be on the upswing.\n\nMilitants have been carrying out \u201cassassinations, suicide attacks, abductions, and arson of crops in both Iraq and Syria,\u201d according to a report this summer by the Pentagon inspector general for operations against the Islamic State. It is establishing \u201cresurgent cells\u201d in Syria, the report said, and \u201cseeking to expand its command and control nodes in Iraq.\u201d\n\nThe militants have been burning crops and emptying out whole villages. They have been raising money by carrying out kidnappings for ransom and extorting \u201ctaxes\u201d from local officials, often skimming a cut of rebuilding contracts.\n\nTheir attacks on village headmen \u2014 at least 30 were killed in Iraq in 2018, according to the Pentagon report \u2014 are an apparent attempt to scare others out of cooperating with Baghdad.\n\n\u201cThe high operational tempo with multiple attacks taking place over a wide area\u201d may be intended to create the appearance that the Islamic State can strike anywhere with \u201cimpunity,\u201d the report said.\n\nMr. Trump first said in December 2018 that he intended to withdraw the last 2,000 American troops from Syria; the Pentagon scaled that back, pulling out about half of those troops.\n\n\u00a9 Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images A Syrian Democratic Forces vehicle on patrol by the Euphrates River near the border with Turkey on Friday.\n\nMilitary officials, though, say that helping the Syrian Democratic Forces hunt down underground cells and fugitive fighters required more training and intelligence support than an open battle for territory. Even the partial drawdown, the Pentagon inspector general\u2019s report found, could be \u201cdetrimental\u201d to the American mission in Iraq and Syria.\n\nLast month, as if to prove its continued vitality, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for a minibus bombing that killed a dozen people near the entrance to a Shiite pilgrimage site in the Iraqi city of Karbala. It was its deadliest attack since the loss of its last territory.\n\nAnd within hours of Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement almost two weeks ago that American forces were moving away from the Syrian border with Turkey, two ISIS suicide bombers attacked a base of the Syrian Democratic Forces in the Syrian city of Raqqa.\n\n\u201cThe crusaders have given up,\u201d Islamic State supporters crowed, according to Laith Alkhouri of the business risk consulting company Flashpoint Global Partners, who monitors the group\u2019s online messages.\n\nOther messages \u201curged ISIS \u2018soldiers\u2019 everywhere to double their efforts,\u201d Mr. Alkhouri said.\n\nThe missions against the Islamic State conducted by the Syrian Democratic Forces \u2014 sometimes as many as two dozen a day \u2014 had included both counterterrorism patrols and raids on militant cells. Some were carried out jointly with American soldiers, others alone, according to United States officials.\n\nBut the Kurds, an ethnic minority sometimes disparaged by Arab Syrians, faced resentment among the Arab residents of northeastern Syria.\n\nIn part to try to win support from those communities, the Kurdish-led forces pardoned and released hundreds of detained ISIS fighters or supporters in so-called reconciliation deals, relying on informal relationships with community leaders to handle their reintegration.\n\nThe Kurdish-led militia even incorporated some of the released Islamic State detainees into its own forces, said Dareen Khalifa, a researcher with the International Crisis Group who has traveled to the region extensively and documented the \u201creconciliation\u201d pardons in a report last summer.\n\nThe Kurdish militia leaders said: \u201cWhat do you want us to do, kill them all? Imprison them all? The best way forward is to keep a close eye on them by keeping them within the S.D.F.,\u201d Ms. Khalifa said in an interview. She said that those enlisted had not been Islamic State leaders and that so far there had been no recidivism.\n\nBut now the American withdrawal and the Turkish incursion are threatening the informal supervision of those former prisoners, Ms. Khalifa said, creating a risk that some might gravitate back to fighting for the Islamic State.\n\nTurkey, which has battled Kurdish separatist militants at home for decades, launched the invasion primarily to push back the Kurdish-led forces in Syria. Without American protection, the Kurdish leaders are now switching sides to ally with Mr. al-Assad.\n\nIn Iraq, too, some say opportunities may be emerging for the Islamic State to revive its appeals to Sunni resentments in the areas it once controlled. Promises of postwar reconstruction have gone unfilled. And Shiite militias that rose up to defeat the Islamic State remain in place, sometimes seeking to profit off the local populations.\n\n\u201cPeople in the liberated areas say: \u2018Why are all these armed groups still around? Why do they still call us all ISIS, and why are they taxing us or extorting us and taking all of our money?\u2019,\u201d said Renad Mansour, the director of the Iraq Initiative at Chatham House.\n\nThe campaign against the Islamic State, he said, \u201cwas a military solution to what is a social and political problem.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, for his part, has insisted repeatedly that Turkey should take over the fight against the Islamic State in Syria. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be your responsibility,\u201d Mr. Trump said he told the country\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nBut current and former United States officials say the Turkish military has a bleak track record at counterterrorism and little hope of filling the void left by the Americans and the Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\n\u201cThat is wishful thinking as far as I can tell,\u201d said Dana Stroul, co-chairwoman of the congressionally sponsored Syria Study Group and a former Pentagon official.", "description": "ISIS Reaps Gains of U.S. Pullout From Syria", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAJ7hn2.img?h=169&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
