There were times she\u2019s even counted herself out. But in the end, she overcome her struggles to become a better version of herself.\n\nFriday, Fabian (2-1 MMA) looks to overcome perhaps her biggest obstacle in the form of Kayla Harrison (5-0 MMA) at PFL 2019: Playoffs 1. The event takes place at Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. The main card airs on ESPN 2 after prelims stream on ESPN+.\n\nFabian has been passionate for athletics for as long as she can remember, but her love didn\u2019t always center around combat sports. During her youth and through her adolescence, Fabian was a standout runner. She competed on the international level, having partaken in the Junior Olympics and Pan Pacific games.\n\nA torn hamstring derailed her track hopes, so she turned to rowing. That\u2019s when a bad car accident turned things from bad to worse. It took some time, but Fabian had to regroup physically, but even moreso mentally. In the process of doing so, she fell in love with muay thai during a trip to Thailand.\n\n\u201cLong story short, I got immersed and got addicted and started fighting,\u201d Fabian told MMA Junkie. \u201cI took it the point I am now. I haven\u2019t stopped since.\u201d\n\nThe switch from running to fighting was easy, according to Fabian. The physical actions are different, but the mental principles and overall mindset are the same.\n\n\u201cThe dedication, professionalism, and the discipline definitely crossed over from my background,\u201d Fabian said. \u201cBeing humble and having that mindset was major. Once I fell in love with the technique and the sport itself, I appreciated it for what it was.\n\n\u201cThe switch had been in my mind. I was greatly athletic and able to pick things up really fast. I just switched that mindset to like, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m going to do this for real.'\u201d\n\nAfter almost four years away from pro MMA competition, Fabian returned for her sophomore fight at PFL 2019: Week 1, where she lost an unanimous decision to Bobbi-Jo Daziel.\n\nIn her second regular-season fight, Fabian reentered the win column when she knocked out Moriel Charneski in the first round at PFL 2019: Week 4. The victory earned her six points and punched her ticket into the postseason.\n\nA product of CSA Gym and City Kickboxing, Fabian has been able to train with some of the best martial artists in the world over the past years, including newly crowned UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya. Her journey through the PFL regular season helped her improve leaps and bounds, alleged Fabian.\n\n\u201cIt was getting that cage time,\u201d Fabian said. \u201cThe opportunity with PFL has been enough for me to really put them to practice and put them into play under the lights. I belong in there.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s under no illusion \u2013 Fabian knows she\u2019ll be an underdog on fight night. Going up against not only the face of the division, but arguably of the entire PFL promotion, Fabian has embraced the underdog title.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t negate what I\u2019m about to do or what I\u2019m preparing to do come fight night,\u201d Fabian said. \u201cI\u2019m okay with being the underdog or being counted out. It\u2019s just gives me the opportunity to really showcase me. It\u2019s a huge opportunity and I feel really confident.\u201d\n\nSo what does Fabian think makes her different from the other five females who have tried to rid Harrison of the zero in her loss column? There are a few factors, but none more prevalent than Fabian\u2019s physicality.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s never faced someone as physical as me,\u201d Fabian said. \u201cShe\u2019s got a specific skillset that has proven to make her dominant, thus far. Just as much as she specializes in her area, I\u2019m just as specialized in mine. I\u2019m world class in mine and that will be my time to showcase it.\n\n\u201cWe left no stone unturned for her style and what she showcased to date. My physicality, my accuracy, my timing, my range is something she hasn\u2019t come up against yet. It\u2019s who can do that the best that night and keep it where we want it.\u201d", "description": "At PFL 2019: Playoffs 1, Genah Fabian looks to overcome another obstacle in Kayla Harrison when the two fighters square off in Las Vegas.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Brian Garcia", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "George Garcia"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/genah.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
