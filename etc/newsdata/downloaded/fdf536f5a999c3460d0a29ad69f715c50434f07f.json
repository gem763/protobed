It was a bombshell story.\n\nBut now Apple has gone on the attack - angry in public, and absolutely incensed in private at what is being seen as something of a stitch up. Google is standing by its research.\n\nIn a statement posted on Friday, Apple took issue with Google\u2019s characterisation that this was a broad attack on all iPhone users.\n\n\"Google\u2019s post, issued six months after iOS patches were released, creates the false impression of 'mass exploitation' to 'monitor the private activities of entire populations in real time,' stoking fear among all iPhone users that their devices had been compromised,\u201d it reads.\n\n\"This was never the case.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s bone of contention isn\u2019t so much about what Google\u2019s Project Zero team included in its report. Rather, Apple is upset about what was left out. The view from Cupertino is that Google\u2019s business interests in China led it to pull back on describing the attack as being targeted at the persecuted Uighur community.\n\n\"The sophisticated attack was narrowly focused, not a broad-based exploit of iPhones 'en masse' as described. The attack affected fewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related to the Uighur community.\u201d\n\nAndroid affected\n\nThis perspective is backed up by independent research from Volexity, a cyber-security firm based in Washington DC. It published a report earlier this month looking into the same threat, and stated unequivocally that Uighurs were the target - detailing 11 websites that had been used to carry out the attack.\n\nMost notably, the Volexity report states that as well as Apple\u2019s iOS, Google\u2019s own mobile operating system, Android, was also targeted - a detail that was missing from Google\u2019s research.\n\nGoogle insists it didn\u2019t know Android was affected - but it\u2019s well aware how it looks.\n\nTim Willis, a researcher on the Project Zero team, wrote in a tweet that Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group \"only saw iOS exploitation on these sites when TAG found them back in Jan 2019 (and yes, they looked for everything else as well)\u201d.\n\nThe independent researchers I\u2019ve spoken to are mostly giving Project Zero the benefit of the doubt on that point. It\u2019s a highly respected group in the cyber-security space, and hasn\u2019t been seen as some kind of weapon against Google\u2019s rivals. Besides, this isn\u2019t exactly the first time it\u2019s found something involving Apple - the group has reported over 200 vulnerabilities to the company to date, most without this kind of fanfare or controversy.\n\n\"Project Zero posts technical research that is designed to advance the understanding of security vulnerabilities, which leads to better defensive strategies,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\n\"We stand by our in-depth research which was written to focus on the technical aspects of these vulnerabilities. We will continue to work with Apple and other leading companies to help keep people safe online.\u201d\n\nSkin in the game\n\nBut there are big questions about how Google is handling the dreaded \u201cC\u201d word: China. There\u2019s no mention of the country in Project Zero\u2019s research, and a spokesman on Friday wouldn\u2019t tell me if Google had known the Uighurs were being targeted. But given the researchers said they\u2019d identified various web addresses affected, it seems very unlikely that two-and-two were not put together. One of the URLs, to give you an example, was quite clearly a news site aimed at Uighur readers, or at least those interested in their plight.\n\nGoogle has form in this area. You may remember a story last month regarding China-backed misinformation efforts on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, designed to sow discord in troubled Hong Kong. Unlike Facebook and Twitter, which stated clearly they felt Beijing was behind the efforts - Google stopped short, saying only that it had removed material related to protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThere are also questions for Apple, however. If, as claimed in its statement, Apple knew about the iOS flaw before Google informed them, why did they not properly inform their users? Why, if it knew there were several booby-trapped websites scooping up data on the Uighurs, did it not warn them?\n\nAnd Apple, like Google, won\u2019t say if they think Beijing is directly responsible. That\u2019s the bigger story here - the extent to which China\u2019s malicious behaviour is being swept under the carpet, because the companies involved have too much skin the the game.\n\n_____\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?
