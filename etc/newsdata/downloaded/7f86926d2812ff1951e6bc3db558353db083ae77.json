Three, turn, five, six, crossover, seven, eight.Narrator: We got to meet some of the show\u2019s principal performers. Like Nelson Sanchez Leemet, who plays the role of Woody. Maria Starr, who plays Elastigirl. And Nathan Miller and Sophia Adams, who star as Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. We went behind the scenes.Nelson Sanchez Leemet: I feel like I\u2019m a gymnast, not gonna lie.Narrator: To find out how these athletic performers push themselves to limits they didn\u2019t even know were possible.Maria Starr: Honestly, six weeks ago, I don\u2019t think that I could do these, and now I could do them and talk to you.Narrator: This is what it takes to perform in \u201cDisney on Ice.\u201d We caught up with the cast and crew of \u201cDisney on Ice Presents: Road Trip Adventures,\u201d the brand\u2019s newest show, just days before the company set out on a two-year, 67-city tour of North America.Cindy Stewart: Take a break. [clapping]Narrator: The show is created here, at Feld Entertainment Studios in Ellenton, Florida, about 40 miles south of Tampa. Inside the 580,000-square-foot facility, the cast and crew have spent roughly a year putting the show together, rehearsing and training six days a week, for eight hours a day, in a full-size rink complete with lights, props, and high-end LED screens.Stewart: We\u2019re in our final rehearsals before our first preview show. And we\u2019re just tying up loose ends and making last-minute changes.Narrator: On the day of our visit, friends and family of Feld Entertainment employees filled the arena to witness a special preview performance of \u201cRoad Trip Adventures.\u201d Along with familiar faces like Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy, the new show features segments from recent Disney movies, like \u201cAladdin,\u201d \u201cToy Story 4,\u201d and \u201cMary Poppins Returns.\u201dNicole Feld: We partner with the Disney Company to understand what\u2019s in their content pipeline. What\u2019s new and different, what\u2019s coming out. And from there we pick out the moments that we feel like are gonna resonate the most with audiences.Graham Flanagan: You use these skates for a long time, or?Starr: I never have them more than 11 months. It\u2019s, like, always 10 or 11 months.Santiago: All right, so, \u201cTrip a Little Light Fantastic.\u201d The number overall is looking really great, but there\u2019s three sections I really wanna clean up today. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One and two.Narrator: The \u201cRoad Trip Adventures\u201d cast features 53 performers.Santiago: Much better.Narrator: Feld Entertainment wouldn\u2019t share details about their salaries but did say that they are provided with healthcare.Judy Thomas: Most of the skaters here have grown up skating, from young children through competitions. And we really do recruit and go out and really search the talent through competitions as they\u2019re coming up through the different levels.Santiago: One, two, three, and four. Good. So, Nelson, just make sure that you\u2019re heel together, lean back, lean forward.Leemet: I was born in the Dominican Republic, so, no winter, no snow, no big rinks. Never even thought about figure skating until I was 10 when I moved to Canada. I didn\u2019t really like the competitive side of skating, I was more performing and letting the audience enjoy the performance. So when it got too competitive, I kinda took a step back and I looked at \u201cDisney on Ice.\u201d So I was like, I have to do that, it\u2019s my turn now. And here I am today.Starr: I skated competitively and did that until I graduated high school. And then I just applied for \u201cDisney on Ice,\u201d sent in a skating r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and, like, video of my skating. And I got offered a job. And I was here a month later. And I\u2019ve been on the road, this\u2019ll be my 10th year.Nathan Miller: I\u2019ve actually been skating for about 25 years now. When I was a kid, I lived in Oklahoma City, and \u201cDisney on Ice\u201d always came through at the state fair. And that was, like, a big highlight for me as a child. And I always as a kid wanted to skate alongside Goofy, and, I mean, here I am, now eight years, and I still get to do it.Flanagan: Was meeting Goofy everything you\u2019d hoped it would be?Miller: Oh, it was everything I hoped it would be. It was so much fun.Sophia Adams: I was just a competitive skater for the US. I\u2019ve been training for my whole life. I\u2019ve been to Nationals, I\u2019ve done the whole thing. But I really wanted to travel, I really wanted to earn a living off of what I do as a career. I\u2019ve been with the company for about five years. I\u2019ve travelled around the world, almost on every tour possible. But what is also extremely great about this particular show is I actually get to fly.Narrator: While the show is called \u201cDisney on Ice,\u201d some performers spend a bulk of their time in the air. In addition to skating, the show features complex aerial choreography.Miller: Do the arabesque death spiral release, and then we\u2019ll stop here.Narrator: This requires collaboration between the performers and crew members in charge of operating the cables connected to their harnesses.Danica O\u2019Neill: A lot of the people that we have have never really flown before or done any aerial work because they are naturally skaters. So where they have started and where they are now has grown so much. So we are able to do more the more that they are comfortable with and can do.Turner: So, we actually have to have a close relationship with our operator when we\u2019re learning this process because, you know, there\u2019s only so much I can do. Like, I can\u2019t even come up to you yet, because I\u2019ve, you know, I\u2019m kind of on a leash. And so you have to get together with our operator to give you more slack, less slack, and tension. And help me spin and fly. So instead of just working with a partner, you\u2019re also working with another partner.Narrator: Along with aerial work, the show\u2019s cast must develop other skills that go beyond skating.Leemet: This is called a rollup. And it uses a lot of abs and upper-body strength. It really works your back and all these muscles that we never really use as figure skaters. But we have to use it now.Narrator: Nelson\u2019s upper-body strength is put to the test during the \u201cMary Poppins\u201d segment of the show.Leemet: Being able to hold on for grip for so long up there, all my weight\u2019s in my hands for the first time ever. You know, we\u2019re used to being on skates on our own body; it\u2019s all upper-body now.Narrator: The \u201cMary Poppins\u201d segment also combines feats of upper-body strength with aerial work, which occurs when the lampposts suddenly take flight.Leemet: We always have communication; it\u2019s the most important part. If something goes wrong, we have a few little waves, thumbs down means down, you know, feet like this also means down, like an emergency exit, in case something goes wrong. At first we started low, but the higher we started going, it\u2019s definitely a little scary.Narrator: Not every role in \u201cDisney on Ice\u201d requires quite the same level of athletic ability. But each part contributes to the overall experience.Santiago: Especially figure skaters, it\u2019s a very solitary sport. We don\u2019t grow up always working with, like, a large group together. Getting them to see the bigger picture, know that it\u2019s not yourself out on the ice by yourself, you\u2019re a part of a huge unit that\u2019s performing in front of thousands of people. So, it\u2019s kinda getting the mindset of your everyday figure skater into the mindset of a professional athlete. They have grown a really close bond, and they have become really good friends, and they support each other. It\u2019s a really good group of people that we have here.Leemet: When I go out there and I see the audience react so well to us, and all these families come together and share such a beautiful moment, it gives me so much joy. Makes me miss my family, but they\u2019re proud of me. I know they\u2019re proud of me.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
