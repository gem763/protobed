The panel will consider several bills that include a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines and \u201cred flag\u201d legislation that would encourage states to confiscate firearms from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.\n\nBut only one bill, named the Disarm Hate Act, would seek to use hate crime laws to curb gun violence. The measure, which mirrors laws already on the books in three U.S. states, would prohibit people convicted of certain violent hate crime misdemeanors from possessing a gun.\n\nCurrently, federal law bars only those convicted of more serious hate crime felony offenses from having guns.\n\nSeventy-two percent of U.S. voters want Congress to do more to reduce gun violence, while a majority view prejudice against immigrants as a very serious problem, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday.\n\nBut if approved by the committee and adopted by the full House, the measure could have a hard time in the Senate, where Republican aides say discussions have focused on background checks and red flag legislation.\n\nThe powerful National Rifle Association, which opposes most gun restrictions, said it sees no reason for Congress to change criminal law to control guns.\n\n\u201cUnder current law, our legal and criminal justice systems have the tools to keep firearms out the hands of all dangerous criminals - whatever the motivation for their crime,\u201d NRA spokeswoman Catherine Mortensen said in a statement.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A woman holds a sign during a rally against white supremacy in the wake of mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso in front of the White House in Washington, U.S., August 6, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo\n\nBut even if it became law, the Disarm Hate Act could prove to be little more than symbolic. Experts estimate there are no more than 1,000 hate crime convictions in any given year and that just a small fraction involve misdemeanors. And while 45 of the 50 U.S. states have some type of hate crime law on the books, only about 30 have hate crime misdemeanor offenses.\n\nStill, the bill\u2019s advocates argue that extending the prohibition on firearm possession from hate crime felonies to misdemeanors would close an important gap at a time of rising hate crime activity.\n\nHate crime incidents have climbed 31% since 2014 to their highest level in nearly a decade, according to FBI data that show a 17% jump to 7,175 incidents in 2017. The number of hate crime groups rose 30% from 2014 to 2018, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nExperts, meanwhile, say a growing number of mass shootings that involve hate bias could suggest an increasingly deadly role for guns in hate crime activity.\n\n\u201cIf we start to see more people using guns targeting others because of race, religion, ethnicity, immigration status, it\u2019s going to really change the game for hate crimes,\u201d said Jack McDevitt, a leading expert on hate crimes at Northeastern University\u2019s Institute on Race and Justice.\n\nAdvocates say extending the ban to misdemeanors that involve physical force or a credible threat to personal safety could allow police to intervene early against individuals who could go on to carry out deadly attacks.\n\n\u201cWe know that an early precursor to many of these mass shootings is some hate crime activity,\u201d said U.S. Representative David Cicilline, who introduced the bill, which has 136 Democratic co-sponsors.\n\n\u201cIf you look at communities of color, religious minorities or the LGBTQ community, hate crimes against each of these groups have increased,\u201d Cicilline told Reuters.\n\nSeveral Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee were unavailable to comment on gun legislation despite repeated Reuters queries. They are expected at the meeting where the new legislation will be taken up for consideration, however.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man prays at a memorial three days after a mass shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, U.S. August 6, 2019. REUTERS/Callaghan O'Hare\n\nRepublicans favor legislation that would create a Mass Violence Prevention Center within the Justice Department to coordinate law enforcement responses to potential violence. It would allow for more federal prosecutors to address violent crimes and would try to reduce the flow of firearms to the black market by stiffening penalties for gun thefts from licensed dealers.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to help prevent mass tragedy, we need to keep guns off the black market. We need to help local, state and federal law enforcement better coordinate responses to potential threats of mass violence,\u201d said a Republican committee aide, who requested anonymity.", "description": "A month after a white gunman targeting Latinos killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas, the Democratic-led U.S. House Judiciary Committee will consider new legislation to address rising fears about a convergence of mass shootings and hate crimes.", "authors": ["David Morgan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190830&t=2&i=1424463979&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7T1C5"}
