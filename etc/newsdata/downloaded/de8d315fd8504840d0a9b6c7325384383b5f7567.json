Not for Australia coach Michael Cheika.\n\nCheika has changed his halves pairing for Friday\u2019s match against Georgia for the third time in four matches, naming Matt To\u2019omua at flyhalf and Nic White at scrumhalf as he searches for his strongest combination a week out from the quarterfinals.\n\nAustralia leads Pool C but isn\u2019t yet guaranteed a quarterfinal place and captain David Pocock said the Wallabies can\u2019t afford to look any further ahead than Georgia.\n\nBernard Foley and Christian Leali\u2019ifano have previously started in the No. 10 jersey in Australia\u2019s wins over Fiji and Uruguay and its loss to Wales. Cheika will now try To\u2019omua, who has started only four of 50 test matches at flyhalf.\n\nLeali\u2019ifano combined with White against Fiji and Uruguay while Foley paired with Will Genia against Wales.\n\nCheika says his selection changes serve the dual purpose of managing player workload - Leali\u2019ifano played all 80 minutes against Uruguay - and promoting competition for positions.\n\nTo\u2019omua is \u201ca different player to Leali\u2019ifano and Foley,\u201d Cheika said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a different style and (he\u2019s) a different type of defender and he\u2019s done well in the opportunities he\u2019s been given.\u201d\n\nFoley and Leali\u2019ifano haven\u2019t yet been able to preside over the 80 minute performance Chieka has been looking for and he now hopes the 29-year-old To\u2019omua, in his first start at flyhalf since November, might be able to guide a more complete performance.\n\n\u201cThis is how we think this squad is best is to keep giving opportunities to guys to keep the contest alive with others,\u201d Chieka said. \u201cSo if we do the right thing and get through knockout stages, we know everyone\u2019s been a part of doing their bit.\n\n\u201cSome want to go with the same players all the time and maybe rest out. We feel like keeping players competing for spots is working for us. I think we\u2019re playing some good footy.\u201d\n\nCheika doubts that selection instability has contributed to the Wallabies\u2019 slow starts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re not playing well there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re creating opportunities at starts of games but we\u2019re not capitalizing on them.\n\n\u201cThat just takes that little bit of extra concentration on staying in the moment. I think sometimes in the game we\u2019re thinking about the bigger picture of the game.\n\n\u201cObviously, other teams are coming hard at us because they know it\u2019s an opportunity to try and get us there, so we\u2019ve just got to lift our standard there, it\u2019s pretty simple.\u201d\n\nGeorgia and Australia\u2019s meeting on Friday will be their first in tests.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very physical, that\u2019s quite obvious,\u201d Cheika said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a really good challenge for us.\n\n\u201cA lot of players play in professional leagues in France, England as well. They\u201dre well attuned to competition at a high level.\n\n\u201cIt\u201ds really exciting to be part of the first time two countries have ever faced off. We want to show them how we play our rugby and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be showing us how they play theirs.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For most coaches at the Rugby World Cup, selection stability is a key issue as the knockout rounds loom.
