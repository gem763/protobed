Many of the Loire\u2019s best kept secrets are well off main roads and often a 20- to 30-minute drive between stops. All of this effort is handsomely rewarded with nonstop picturesque sloping hills and sprawling farmsteads passing by along 15th-century roads.\n\nSTAY\n\nBesides a few newer hotels that have sprung up, most accommodations throughout the valley represent some aspect of the region\u2019s history. Luxury lodging is frequently built within a castle, vintage guesthouse, or other property from a bygone era.\n\nOutside of the city of Tours, Domaine de la Tortini\u00e8re is a well-maintained example of an older castle residence outfitted in modern amenities popular with boutique group tours. The Olivereau family has gone to great lengths to preserve the Second Empire history of the grounds while integrating high-level service and creature comforts.\n\nFor a more intimate experience, La Perluette in Blois is a charming 19 th century guest house right on the Loire River, well positioned between several points of interest. The couple who run the property have done a masterful job restoring the home to its past glory and offer hospitality rivaling much larger properties.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not the most luxurious option in the valley, Le Ch\u00e2telet in the southern village of Thilouze offers the rare opportunity to stay in a largely unrenovated castle, living as those in medieval times would. The national heritage building relishes in at least 500 years of history (as records before 1520 have been lost), and the same family has owned the castle for the last three centuries.\n\nWhile there is modern plumbing and electricity, period furnishings, and d\u00e9cor are retained.\n\nIn the heart of the Valley, Hotel Ch\u00e2teau de Verri\u00e8res feels like a step back into the opulence of historical France. The stately property was built in 1896 for a French general and resides in Saumur, one of France\u2019s equestrian centers. Each of the home\u2019s 10 rooms has its own unique charm and style, correlating to the surrounding region.\n\nDINE\n\nThere are few better places within France to enjoy the country\u2019s traditional cuisine. Many of the area\u2019s small communities and villages date back hundreds of years, and the gastronomy has remained largely the same, developed based on what the land provides.\n\nLa Creusille in Blois blurs the lines between casual and elegant, with a variety of dishes featuring vegetables and legumes from the area, combining them with excellent fish, duck, veal, and more. A local pike with yuzu sauce is not to be missed.\n\nL\u2019Orangerie at Domaine de la Tortini\u00e8re is fine dining to match the surroundings. Overlooking their sizable grounds, the restaurant has multiple full-coursed menus, all changing along with the seasons. Opt for the cheese plate with full tableside service representing a range of fromages from across the country.\n\nFarther west, Restaurant Le Montsorelli at H\u00f4tel Le Bussy in Montsoreau exemplifies locally-sourced dining. Overlooking a ch\u00e2teau and the river, guests can dine on dishes featuring ingredients from a nearby garden. Like other fine traditional French dining, expect a longer meal than the average dinner.\n\nVillandry Gardens. Geoff Nudelman\n\nDRINK\n\nWithin the Loire Valley, there are 69 separate vineyard appellations. Among the truly local varieties, anything made from the Chenin grape comes highly recommended.\n\nAs the climate and environment has changed over the years, French winemakers are beginning to adapt to warmer, more unpredictable conditions. When New Jersey native Peter Hahn looked to start a winery in France, he knew that he wanted to create a wine free of chemicals and additives, solely producing off the land.\n\nThe result is Le Clos de la Meslerie: A completely organic vineyard and production site pumping out solely Chenin Blanc\u2014and a very good one at that. Hahn is working toward a potential Biodynamic certification and maintains a 10,000-bottle annual production with his wife, who oversees an on-site rental cottage as well. Like many in the area, the winery is only open by appointment.\n\nA great place to enjoy said wine is Volupia - a mostly-outdoors bar/hangout with a troglodyte cellar dating back to the 17th century. The bar features more than 60 Loire wines, 20 beers (some local) and a perfectly casual setting that backs up right to the river.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nThroughout the Valley, you\u2019ll find 82 different ch\u00e2teaux, which are by far the area\u2019s most popular attractions. More than half are closed to the public, but many of the more impressive ones are open to all.\n\nIt would take months to visit them all, but a first-timer\u2019s visit could and should include four: Villandry, Chenonceau, Beauregard, and Chambord.\n\nThe gardens at Ch\u00e2teau Villandry are a meticulously maintained organic initiative with 115,000 flower and vegetable plants across the grounds. Just 10 gardeners (who are highly vetted) tend to the gardens. The view from the Ch\u00e2teau\u2019s second floor offers a unique perspective of each plot, which represents something different within the history of the site.\n\nWhile visiting Villandry, don\u2019t miss the high-level collection of Spanish art dating from the 17th century, mostly put together by the Carvallo family, which took ownership of the castle in 1906.\n\nCh\u00e2teau de Chenonceau\u2019s drama-filled history is a stark contrast to Villandry. Chenonceau is often called \u201cthe ladies\u2019 ch\u00e2teau,\u201d due to its extensive history with female nobility of French and other descent. Additionally, in World War II, the Cher River, which runs beneath the castle\u2019s loops, was the Demarcation Line (dividing France from German occupation), meaning that Chenonceau was always on the cusp of peace or destruction depending on German military activity at the time. A German artillery unit was kept at the ready at all times to destroy it. Fortunately, the castle remains standing.\n\nJust under the radar of the major ch\u00e2teaux is the smaller Beauregard. While its grounds make more excellent picnicking or easy biking, the residence\u2019s Portrait Room is stunning. Its 327 portraits of European nobility\u2014from cardinals to Turkish sultans\u2014stand majestically above a floor of 17th century Afghan delft floor tile that at the time of construction was valued at seven times the price of gold.\n\nThe grandiose Ch\u00e2teau Chambord is a great way to wrap any visit to the valley. The sheer size of the structure is stunning, as is the transactional history of the property. It\u2019s an important part of French history and certainly worth a few hours to enjoy this marvel.\n\nAnd, of course, there are so many more chateaux to explore. In the western third of the valley, Brissac is another stunning maison with the opportunity to actually stay in the building, which dates to the 1500s. Just 75 minutes north is Le Mans, home to the famous 24-hour car race and a number of auto enthusiast experiences.\n\nThe writer was a guest of Domaine de la Tortini\u00e8re, La Creusille, Le Clois de la Meslerie, Chateau Villandry, Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau, Ch\u00e2teau de Beauregard, and Ch\u00e2teau Chambord.", "description": "An off-the-beaten path bounty of ch\u00e2teaux, cycling, and wineries", "authors": ["Geoff Nudelman"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-120927/social", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
