They have also raised questions about the effectiveness of the already-embattled ThriveNYC program \u2014 the $1 billion mental health initiative created by first lady Chirlane McCray.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDe Blasio resisted calls to get more aggressive in removing mentally ill homeless people from the streets.\n\n\u201cA lot of people would like the easy solution \u2014 just anyone who seems to be a problem is removed and sent to a mental institution. That\u2019s what happened in this state, in this country for decades and decades. It led to horrific outcomes for a lot of people,\u201d de Blasio told reporters at a press conference in Queens.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back on that merry-go-round. We need to be really clear about that moment where someone is a danger to themselves or others, where they should be removed from the streets, where they should be compelled to get treatment, versus a situation where there are other tools to use,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have to be careful about that, because we don\u2019t have endless capacity to put people in mental institutions ... And because it\u2019s a country of laws, that respects individual liberty.\u201d\n\nState legislation known as Kendra\u2019s Law allows people to be committed to psychiatric treatment against their will under certain circumstances. It was used 2,500 times last year, de Blasio said.\n\nPolice Commissioner James O\u2019Neill acknowledged cops struggle to decide when someone poses enough of a danger that they can be removed from the streets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult call,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere do you draw the line?\u201d\n\nSantos had been arrested at least six times in the last two years \u2014 including for multiple random, violent assaults \u2014 and also had a number of additional sealed arrests, police said.\n\nHe\u2019s now been linked to another attack against a homeless man a week before the Chinatown murders, NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said Tuesday. A man sleeping on a bench along the West Side Highway woke up to find someone attacking him with a stick, and attempting to throw him over a railing into the Hudson River.\n\nPolice have surveillance video of Santos seven blocks away and believe he was behind the attack, Shea said.\n\n\u201cThe current status quo is not working, and the completely hands off approach is not working,\u201d said City Council Member Joe Borelli. \u201cAt some point, when there are people who have multiple arrests, when they\u2019re posing a threat to others ... we have to be more aggressive in applying the maximum legal pressure.\u201d\n\nThriveNYC has failed to make a dent in the population of seriously mentally ill people on the street, said Borelli, a Republican representing Staten Island.\n\n\u201cWe believed the administration was seriously going to combat the kind of public mental illness that results in homelessness. That was expected from day one,\" he said. \"It hasn\u2019t been addressed.\u201d\n\nThe city has put additional outreach workers on the street in Chinatown, but will not make any immediate policy changes in response to the murders, de Blasio said. \u201cOnce we get all the facts, we might see something we want to do differently, but right now the goal is to get every homeless person off the street,\u201d he said.\n\nDe Blasio also condemned the heated anti-homeless rhetoric used just days after the murders by Queens residents fighting plans for a shelter in their neighborhood.\n\n\u201cI hope somebody\u2019s going to burn the place down,\u201d one woman said of the proposed shelter in a video that circulated on Twitter.\n\nAt the meeting to discuss a proposed men\u2019s shelter in Glendale, hecklers interrupted a moment of silence for the four men bludgeoned to death on the street, the Queens Daily Eagle reported. Another woman called the homeless \u201cdrug addicts and sexual offenders\u201d and said they \u201cshould be locked away forever and out of sight permanently,\u201d according to the paper.\n\nDe Blasio vowed to press forward with plans for a shelter despite the vitriolic opposition.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are human beings. You know, there\u2019s a phrase, 'There but for the grace of God go I.' What we have to educate people about is the vast majority of people in shelters today are there because they simply couldn\u2019t make ends meet ... There\u2019s no place for that kind of rhetoric.\u201d", "description": "De Blasio resisted calls to get more aggressive in removing mentally ill homeless people from the streets.", "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/38/45/19f038684007a78e2f5ea7f77716/180123-bill-de-blasio-speaking-ap-1160.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
