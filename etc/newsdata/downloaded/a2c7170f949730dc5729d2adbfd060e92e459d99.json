While that\u2019s undoubtedly true, there\u2019s another reason for this worry: Many don\u2019t know how to determine how much of their retirement funds they can afford to withdraw each year.\n\nIn fact, in a 2019 survey by the National Institute on Retirement Security, 73% of Americans said they don\u2019t have the financial skills to manage their money in retirement and 79% of retirees said they lacked the investment skills to ensure their retirement savings last throughout retirement.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t know what to do\u201d about retirement savings withdrawals, says David John, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank and a senior policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute.\n\nAn idea to create automatic and flexible retirement income\n\nThat\u2019s why John and three Brookings colleagues just came out with a report describing their new retirement income proposal to help people convert retirement account balances into what they call \u201cautomatic and flexible\u201d income. Its goal: to be simple, transparent, inexpensive and protect people against the risk of outliving their savings.\n\nAs they wrote in their report, \u201cChoosing the best way to convert retirement savings into a stream of income is one of the most complex financial decisions individuals have to make.\u201d\n\nTheir three-pronged idea for automatic retirement income would need regulatory, and possibly legislative, approval as well as buy-in from employers. But it seems so smart and could be so valuable to so many retirees that I wanted to share how it could work, with hopes that the solution will become reality.\n\n\u201cWe wanted something that would make the decisions individuals would have to make, but does it by using financial professionals, rather than guesswork, blogs and the advice of their neighbors,\u201d said John.\n\n3 features in the Brookings researchers\u2019 proposal\n\nThe proposal by John and Brookings\u2019 William Gale, J. Mark Iwry and Aaron Krupkin would have three features:\n\nSomething called a pooled managed payout fund\n\nAnother fund that retirees could use to withdraw money for emergencies and other special purposes\n\nA longevity annuity\n\nI\u2019ll take those one at a time.\n\nA pooled managed payout fund. You may be familiar with target-date funds, often offered by 401(k) plans, where you pick your anticipated retirement year and the fund manager invests in stocks and bonds accordingly. When you\u2019re years from retirement, the fund loads up on stocks (because you have time to rebound from market dips). As retirement nears, the fund tilts toward conservative bonds with steady income. Well, a pooled managed payout fund is kind of like that, but for your years in retirement.\n\nA pooled managed payout fund is a diversified, professionally managed pool of investments designed to pay out a relatively consistent level of annual income in retirement through monthly or quarterly cash distributions. The income isn\u2019t guaranteed, but the fund is designed to reduce losses through consistent investment returns and maybe some growth over time.\n\nThe Brookings researchers\u2019 plan would automatically enroll employees in the pooled managed payout fund. And the fund could accept cash from retirement plans of employees\u2019 previous employers, their rollover individual retirement accounts and their own IRAs.\n\nThere are a few such funds, like the Vanguard Managed Payout Fund. But, John said, \u201cthey tend to be very small comparatively\u201d and sold to individuals, rather than offered to employees.\n\nThe Brookings analysts say the Vanguard fund aims to pay investors an amount equal to about 4% of their annual assets. That 4% figure is the benchmark financial advisers often use for the amount people can safely withdraw from their retirement funds annually without running out of money.\n\nA fund setting aside about 10% of the money in the managed payout fund for withdrawals to cover emergencies or other special purposes. The Brookings researchers note in their report that JP Morgan Chase Institute studies show that older households are \u201cmore likely to have extraordinary expenditures for health care, auto repair, and taxes than younger families. Typically, when employers let their retirees take their retirement funds as annuities with regular income payouts, they don\u2019t allow for extra withdrawals when emergencies arise.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to come up with something that was flexible enough so when people arrived at retirement and found that what they initially planned wasn\u2019t effective, they could change it\u201d with emergency-fund withdrawals, said John.\n\nA longevity annuity. With most annuities, known as immediate annuities, you hand over a chunk of money to an insurance company and it then invests the cash, sending you monthly income for life. Those payouts either start immediately or soon after you buy the annuity. But with a longevity annuity, sometimes called a deferred-income annuity, you typically give the insurer a lump of cash and the payouts begin once you\u2019re 85 or so, continuing for the rest of your life.\n\nRelated: Don\u2019t make these blunders with a variable annuity\n\nIn exchange for delaying receiving money, the longevity annuity\u2019s monthly payments are higher than with an immediate annuity. If you die before the money begins rolling out, your beneficiary typically receives a death benefit or a guaranteed number of reduced monthly payments.\n\nThe Brookings analysts\u2019 plan calls for a deferred annuity that starts roughly 20 years after retirement. It\u2019s the \u201csafety net\u201d portion of their idea, to help ensure retirees don\u2019t outlive their savings. Currently, only about 10% of 401(k) plans offer annuities as a retirement income option, although Congress is considering legislation to make annuities more widespread.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in other countries\n\nJohn and his colleagues note that versions of their idea exist in other parts of the world or are being considered.\n\nFor instance, they note, the Shell Netherlands company has a managed payout fund for employees hired since July 1, 2013. Retirees can buy annuities with the money when they leave their jobs.\n\nSee: Retired or retiring soon? It\u2019s time to fund a Roth IRA\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) \u2014 a pension provider set up by the government for U.K. employers \u2014 is looking into a proposal similar to the Brookings\u2019 one. It would combine a managed payout pool (90% of a saver\u2019s retirement assets), the ability to take partial payouts for emergencies and other reasons (the other 10%) and protection against longevity risk. People would get monthly income payouts between about age 65 and 85 and could buy deferred annuities after age 75.\n\nAustralia is developing the Comprehensive Income Products for Retirees \u2014 similar to NEST\u2019s \u2014 which would be offered to all retirees starting in 2022.\n\nWhat would need to happen here\n\nThe Brookings researchers\u2019 proposal isn\u2019t quite ready for prime-time, though.\n\nFor one thing, many 401(k)s only let retirees take their money entirely as lump-sum distributions.\n\nFor another, it\u2019s unclear employers can offer managed payout funds and annuities as \u201cdefault investment alternatives\u201d without running afoul of the federal pension law known as ERISA.\n\n\u201cWe talked to three ERISA attorneys and got three different responses,\u201d said John. \u201cOne said our plan would be absolutely allowed. Another said, \u2018I think so, I\u2019m not a hundred percent certain.\u2019 And the other said \u2018I don\u2019t think so.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlso read: How to live it up in retirement without outliving your money\n\nThe Brookings report\u2019s authors are urging the U.S. Department of Labor to amend its regulations to eliminate any concerns.\n\nAnd they think time is of the essence, since increasing numbers of boomers are retiring with 401(k)s each year and little idea how to manage the money.\n\n\u201cWe see very few employers actually offering a retirement income solution,\u201d said John. \u201cAs we go forward, we will have more and more people retiring on a combination of Social Security and savings and it\u2019s frightfully easy to make a bad decision if someone gives you a lump sum and you have no practical experience investing.\u201d", "description": "A simple, transparent, inexpensive solution to protect people against the risk of outliving their savings.", "authors": ["Richard Eisenberg"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ322_na_401_ZG_20190828143003.jpg"}
