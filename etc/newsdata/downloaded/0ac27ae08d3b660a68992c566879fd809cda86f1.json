Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nBen: Today, Senator Kamala Harris wrote a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey requesting that he ban President Trump from the platform, citing his efforts to \u201ctarget, harass, and attempt to out the whistle-blower\u201d who has lodged a complaint against him, and his suggestion that his removal from the presidency will lead to a civil war, among other things. Regardless of the political wisdom of this idea \u2014 Harris is struggling mightily in the polls and this seems like a bid for some attention \u2014 does it make any sense to you?\n\nMax: I mean, sure, it makes sense. She\u2019s right; he\u2019s pretty obviously in violation of Twitter policy and has been for years.\n\nBen: Yeah, this is a frequent complaint lodged by a lot of people. But is it actually a good idea?\n\nMax: Ha. For whom?\n\nBen: Society?\n\nBrian: My attitude about Trump\u2019s use of Twitter mirrors a lot of how I think about stuff like deepfakes: Whether it\u2019s effective is based on whether it\u2019s amplified by other important people/outlets. So would people stop repeating the president\u2019s wild rants if he had to do it on, I dunno, Facebook? Probably not.\n\nBen: I think there\u2019s a difference here: He\u2019s the president, so anything he says is newsworthy, unfortunately \u2014 unlike a deepfake, which could just go unremarked upon.\n\nBrian: Right. I guess that\u2019s my point. Shutting down the account wouldn\u2019t dull any tensions. Would I love to see it happen? Sure. But I can\u2019t imagine it would have a calming effect.\n\nMax: Yeah, I think I agree with Feldman to the extent that \u201cbanning Trump from Twitter\u201d seems like a poor stand-in for some more consequential response. I don\u2019t really think Trump derives as much power from Twitter as I think the call to ban him supposes.\n\nI think society might be marginally better off if he were banned, but, as Feldman is saying, Twitter is just one component of a media ecosystem that has been pretty effectively and thoroughly bent around Trump.\n\nBrian: I think there is a slight belief that if we knock out Trump\u2019s Twitter account, he\u2019ll be crippled somehow. It\u2019s a very na\u00efve, \u201cout of sight out of mind\u201d mentality. He\u2019ll just call into Fox & Friends or call a friendly reporter on background. He\u2019s got plenty of allies willing to amplify his message if he can\u2019t do it himself. Again, I\u2019d love to see tech companies that claim to care about toxicity and stuff put their money where their mouth is, but in the case of the president, it feels pretty pointless.\n\nBen: Okay, so narrowing the scope of the argument a bit: If it won\u2019t make a difference in terms of what the president puts out, does Twitter not have a responsibility to enforce its rules? I think many would cheer banning Trump, not because it will actually turn down the volume of his awfulness but because it would send a message that his conduct is not fit for a prominent communications platform.\n\nMax: I think Twitter has a responsibility to enforce its rules, yeah. But Twitter also has the ability to change it rules in whatever ways it sees fit. The \u201crules\u201d thing is what Kendra Albert calls a \u201clegal talisman\u201d \u2014 we like to talk about the \u201crules\u201d of platforms as though they take the same shape as laws in the context of a government or a state.\n\nIt\u2019s not like Twitter is great at cleanup now. It doesn\u2019t really feel hypocritical that the prez remains when, like, heinous accounts remain all over. He\u2019s not an outlier is all I mean, maybe in stature but not behavior.\n\nBen: Yes, they\u2019re famously bad at this.\n\nBreaking news: Elizabeth Warren was asked about this very question just now, per this tweet:\n\nREPORTER: \u201cShould Donald Trump be banned from Twitter?\u201d\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: [laughs] \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nMax: I think Warren has the right idea. It\u2019s hard for me to gin up much anger at Twitter over this specific thing. \u201cTwitter inconsistently applies its own company policy\u201d seems relatively minor in the scheme of problems in how \u201cthe media\u201d \u2014 as a kind of overall ecosystem \u2014 deals with Trump. And I think trying to isolate Twitter, its relationship to Trump\u2019s personal account, and its deployment of its policies \u2026 I don\u2019t know, it seems kind of narrow-minded at best. Sorry, I know \u201ceh, shrug\u201d is not the kind of invigorating intellectual debate we might want, but I think it\u2019s the one we deserve.\n\nBrian: Once Congress makes it so that Twitter poll results are legally binding contracts, then it\u2019s time to worry.\n\nBen: Presumably you don\u2019t think there\u2019s a chance Twitter would ever follow through on this? What if he specifically directed people to go after, say, Adam Schiff? This hardly seems out of the realm of possibility.\n\nBrian: They\u2019re both public figures \u2014 they live for drama. Remember when that support guy deactivated the account for like 11 minutes? That was so funny. So I guess now I support it because it\u2019d be a good troll.\n\nMax: I guess the problem I have with that hypothetical is, like (I\u2019m thinking out loud here, don\u2019t hold me to this), do we really think Schiff would suddenly be in more danger than normal if Trump tweeted, I don\u2019t know, \u201cGet Adam Schiff\u201d?\n\nBen: Yeah, I do.\n\nMax: Maybe I am underrating the power of DJT or the power of Twitter, or maybe I\u2019m just a callous old troll. But my general feeling about the threat that Trump poses is that it\u2019s generalized and diffuse and occurs along a bunch of different vectors.\n\nAnd that the kind of hypothetical, like, \u201cWell, what if he incited violence in a tweet?\u201d question sort of misses the forest for the trees. I\u2019m just interrogating my own instinctive response.\n\nBen: I see your point \u2014 it\u2019s just that the violation in this case would be SO blatant I think Twitter might have to do something. It\u2019s kind of like impeachment: There was enough there before this Ukraine thing, but this was just so comically corrupt that inaction was not an option.\n\nMax: Yeah, impeachment a good comparison, Ben. I guess where the analogy continues for me is in the way that, by rights, he should have been banned years ago! So it\u2019s hard to take any sort of \u201cjudicial process\u201d around it seriously.\n\nBen: So let\u2019s just not try.\n\nMax: Haha. Well, okay, if we\u2019re talking about impeachment and Twitter, maybe I\u2019d say: To me, there aren\u2019t several specific crimes here that mean he should or should not be impeached or banned. There\u2019s one big overall problem, which is that he\u2019s manifestly corrupt and unfit for office. Actually, I take it back. Maybe this doesn\u2019t get us anywhere. Sorry, it\u2019s turning out I have less of an opinion about this than I actually even thought. I guess I do sort of think he should be banned, but I truly can\u2019t bring myself to care enough to make a strong case for it!\n\nBen: This is the kind of strong conviction people look for when they turn to Intelligencer.\n\nMax: I think more than anything it just speaks to how badly Harris must be doing that she\u2019s picking this up as her issue.\n\nBen: Yes.\n\nBrian: In the face of a zillion important anti-Trump causes, his use of Twitter does not rank highly even for me, an idiot who has to think about Twitter too much.", "description": "Intelligencer staffers discuss whether Kamala Harris\u2019s plea for Twitter to ban President Trump makes sense.", "authors": ["Brian Feldman", "Benjamin Hart", "Max Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/02/02-jack-dorsey.w1200.h630.jpg"}
