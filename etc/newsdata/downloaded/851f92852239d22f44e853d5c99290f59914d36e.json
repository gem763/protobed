He did not get his revenge against the team that passed on him in the draft, selecting Daniel Jones sixth overall instead. Haskins didn\u2019t even perform well \u2014 tossing three interceptions and completing just nine passes in the loss.\n\nBut standing on a post-game podium, Haskins declared that eventually, the Redskins are going to win \u2014 so \u201cget used to me smiling up here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhatever it takes to win, we will do that,\u201d Haskins said. \u201cI don\u2019t like losing. I\u2019ve never lost. I don\u2019t like losing. We\u2019re going to change that.\u201d\n\nFor now, though, the Redskins are a winless football team, off to their first 0-4 start since 2001.\n\nSunday\u2019s performance did nothing to quiet the speculation over Redskins coach Jay Gruden\u2019s job status. The Redskins are searching for answers and look lost.\n\nAnd despite turning to Haskins, Gruden did not commit to starting the Ohio State product next week against the New England Patriots. He told reporters he would evaluate the situation on Monday. Beyond Haskins and Keenum, Washington could also look to veteran Colt McCoy, who practiced this week for the first time since he suffered a setback with his leg injury in mid-August.\n\nPointed out Haskins was the future of the franchise \u2014 which would be a reason to play the 22-year-old for the rest of the season \u2014 Gruden said the rookie would have to earn that label first.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care where you\u2019re drafted, when you\u2019re drafted, you need to earn that,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe\u2019s gotta come in here and perform when he\u2019s asked to perform. If I feel like if he gives us the best chance to win against New England, I\u2019ll put him in there. That\u2019s the way it is at every position with everybody.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not just handed the keys because of where you were drafted.\u201d\n\nGruden sounded frustrated after a humiliating loss and ongoing reports he might be fired. The Redskins have yet to announce such a move, but tensions are high. The 52-year-old didn\u2019t expect his team to be 0-4, adding \u201cnobody saw this coming.\u201d\n\nGruden\u2019s offense mustered just three points and 176 yards against the Giants, who ranked 31st in yards allowed prior to the game. Asked how he would explain the offensive inefficiencies, Gruden rattled off a list of players who weren\u2019t in a Redskins uniform Sunday: Jordan Reed, Trent Williams, Chase Roullier, Brandon Scherff and Terry McLaurin (the latter two were scratched prior to the game with injuries). Again, the Redskins have been missing key playmakers, so much so that Gruden forgot to include Derrius Guice (knee) among those absent.\n\nThen, Gruden honed in on another explanation.\n\n\u201cThe guys who are playing are not executing as well as they should and I\u2019m calling a crappy game,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cMy playcalling isn\u2019t good enough, execution isn\u2019t up to par and we have a lot of pretty good players sitting home watching it.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins began the game looking lifeless on both sides of the ball. Keenum missed wide-open throws and was intercepted on Washington\u2019s first drive.\n\nThe defense was undisciplined and not good enough.\n\nAgain, third down was a major problem. On the Giants\u2019 first drive, Washington made a stop on third-and-7, but New York was called for holding.\n\nRather than decline the penalty to set up fourth down, Gruden bet that the Redskins would make another third-down stop and push the Giants out of field goal range. He lost that bet. The Giants picked up 15 yards and then another two on fourth down, setting up an eventual 6-yard touchdown pass to Wayne Gallman.\n\nLater, down 14-0, Washington couldn\u2019t capitalize on a Quinton Dunbar interception.\n\nKeenum missed receiver Trey Quinn on a play-action shot up in the seam, overthrowing the slot receiver. The Redskins went three-and-out, prompting Gruden to bench Keenum.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not thinking about what\u2019s behind me,\u201d said Keenum, who said he was surprised when he was pulled. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting there thinking about if I\u2019m going to get taken out of the game.\u201d\n\nHaskins\u2019 debut in relief of Keenum left a lot to be desired.\n\nHe showed promise \u2014 scrambling for 14 yards to set up a 21-yard field goal in the second, for example.\n\nBut it was also clear why Gruden and the coaching staff felt the Ohio State product wasn\u2019t ready to play.\n\nOn his first interception, Haskins tried to force a throw to tight end Jeremy Sprinkle. Giants safety Jabrill Peppers jumped the route and returned it for a touchdown.\n\nIn the fourth, Haskins ignored an open Quinn and took an errant shot deep to Paul Richardson that ended up in Janoris Jenkins\u2019 hands instead.\n\nOn his third interception, Haskins wasn\u2019t on the same page with tight end Vernon Davis, who wasn\u2019t expecting the ball. Davis turned around and the ball bounced off his hands for another Jenkins pick.\n\nStill, Haskins wasn\u2019t discouraged after the game. As the quarterback was leaving the field, he noticed cornerback Jimmy Moreland and started a conversation.\n\nGiven the results on the field Sunday, it could have easily been Moreland offering encouragement to his quarterback after a tough game. Instead, it was Haskins talking up the cornerback.\n\n\u201cHe said we gotta turn this program around,\u201d Moreland said. \u201cWe got to turn it around now. He\u2019s the next man up, so he\u2019s just trying to do his job, trying to keep everyone positive and staying focused. \u2026 That\u2019s just the best way for us to move forward.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
