Gordhan was the SARS commissioner at the time.\n\nIn her report, she recommended that President Cyril Ramaphosa should discipline Gordhan within 30 days. She also directed the police and National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to consider criminal charges against him.\n\nImportant constitutional questions\n\nIn appeal papers, Mkhwebane said Judge Sulet Potterill's order had undermined her independence, impartiality, dignity and effectiveness, Business Day reported.\n\nThe order interfered with the functioning of the office and opened her to unprecedented attacks on an institutional and personal level, her lawyers reportedly argued.\n\nMkhwebane initially withdrew her application to the Constitutional Court to appeal the judgment against her in August, but Ramaphosa called on the court to hear it anyway, Fin24 reported.\n\nPotterill had labelled her orders \"vague, contradictory and/or nonsensical\".\n\nIn an opposing affidavit, Ramaphosa said that while he believed the Public Protector's appeal had no reasonable prospects of success and fell outside of the Constitutional Court's jurisdiction, he also believed the issue at hand raised important constitutional questions that were in the country's interests.\n\nIt should not be up to an individual to decide on the matter, he argued.\n\n\"The attitude of the Public Protector should not affect the outcome of this application for leave to appeal,\" Ramaphosa said.\n\n- Compiled by Jenna Etheridge", "description": "Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane believes that a High Court ruling suspending the implementation of remedial action against Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has stripped her office of power and undermined her work.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7735/934e3dbf425444d09bb0f80104159df3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
