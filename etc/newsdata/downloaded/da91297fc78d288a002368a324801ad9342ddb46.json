When intercepted data is not relevant to an investigation, there is no prescribed procedure for it to be destroyed.\n\n\u2022 Rica does not recognise the need for extra protections for people who have a special legal duty to protect the confidentiality of people they speak to, such as lawyers and journalists.\n\n\u2022 The oversight system created by the Rica judge is not sufficient \u2013 in particular the process should include a \u201cpublic advocate\u201d, who should represent the interests of people who have been targeted for surveillance, and to test the reasons for interception which police and intelligence services provide to the Rica judge.\n\n\u2022 Rica does not regulate the state\u2019s \u201cbulk interception\u201d programmes; this refers to mass surveillance practices which involve collecting and analysing massive flows of data of large groups of people, rather than specific individuals who are under investigation for a serious crime.\n\nIn the report Sole says \u201cthe rule of thumb is that electronic communications are not safe\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the structure of many intelligence services that while they claim to be protecting the interests of the country, historically and institutionally they\u2019re often there to protect the king, or whatever the semi-democratic substitute may be.\u201d\n\nAnother high-profile incident of surveillance detailed in the report is the spying on author of The President\u2019s Keepers, Jacques Pauw, by state security agencies after he exposed a network of corruption and abuse of power surrounding Zuma.\n\nPauw exposes three key law enforcement agencies: the South African Revenue Service, the Hawks and the Crime Intelligence divisions of the police, and the State Security Agency as being in cahoots to the corruption and the abuse of power prevalent under Zuma\u2019s administration.\n\nIn May, City Press reported that it had transcripts and recordings of a phone call between Jacques Pauw and Setlhomamaru Dintwe, the inspector-general of intelligence. On the transcript Pauw is referred to as \u201cTarget\u201d.\n\n\u201cI cannot do my job as a journalist if my phone and my emails are being monitored. I cannot speak to sources, I can\u2019t accept any material, I cannot do anything,\u201d Pauw is quoted as saying in the report.\n\nOther journalists reported to have been under surveillance are Mzilikazi wa Afrika and Stephan Hofstatter after they investigated major corruption scandals in the South African Police Service and the police\u2019s Crime Intelligence Division in 2010 and later \u201chad their phones tapped\u201d.\n\nThe Right2Know report suggests that reforms to Rica should be implemented to afford journalists their right to freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that South Africa\u2019s surveillance law, Rica, has failed in several ways to protect journalists\u2019 communications \u2013 along with the communications of the general public. In April 2016, Right2Know tabled a set of demands for surveillance reform with the department of justice and constitutional development that was co-signed by 40 civil society organisations. Several of these demands are of special importance to addressing the weaknesses in Rica that have put the journalists in this publication at risk,\u201d said the organisation.\n\n", "description": "Under the apartheid regime, surveillance of all sectors of society was a common occurrence.
