The leave campaign had been built on lies, he said. Johnson\u2019s oft-repeated claims of progress in the talks were baseless. London had come up with nothing to replace the backstop.\n\nIncredible Sulk morphs from green to yellow as he is bested by Bettel | John Crace Read more\n\nAbove all, the UK \u2013 not the EU \u2013 was to blame for the impasse. \u201cI just want to repeat and remind that Theresa May accepted the withdrawal agreement,\u201d he said. Britain\u2019s \u201chomemade\u201d problems were causing \u201cgeneral problems\u201d for the whole of the EU.\n\nThis was barely concealed anger \u2013 not just at the uncertainty and stress being endured by citizens, companies and countries who, after three years, \u201cwant and deserve clarity\u201d, but at the disingenuous game being played by the British government.\n\nJohnson has talked, repeatedly, of \u201creal signs of movement\u201d in Berlin, Paris and Dublin on getting rid of the backstop, the perennial obstacle to a Brexit agreement. \u201cA huge amount of progress is being made\u201d in the negotiations, he insists.\n\nFor EU officials, the regular meetings with Johnson\u2019s special envoy do not even qualify as \u201cnegotiations\u201d. There are grave doubts, after his suspension of parliament and failure to advance any concrete proposals, that the prime minister wants a deal at all \u2013 and, should one be achieved, that he could get it through parliament.\n\nIdeas for an all-Ireland regulatory regime for food and agriculture, which No 10 thinks would go a long way to replacing the backstop, fall far short of the requirement to protect EU markets from dangerous goods, fraud or unfair competition.\n\nAnd as Bettel\u2019s exasperation made clear, officials in Brussels, and leaders in national capitals, are running out of patience. Hopes that Britain might eventually give Brexit up as a bad job and remain in the EU are giving way to prayers that it won\u2019t.\n\nMany now dread the prospect, remote as it may seem, of a second referendum. \u201cWhy on earth would you want a country so bitterly and hopelessly divided to stay?\u201d asked one diplomat. \u201cThe wounds are going to last generations. How damaging would that be to Europe? Come back, maybe \u2013 but leave and sort things out first.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:18 Boris Johnson on why he skipped Luxembourg press conference \u2013 video\n\nThe EU27 members do not trust Johnson, but many have little confidence in Jeremy Corbyn or in the quarrelsome tribes of remainers either. Certainly, they would rather have a deal: no one wants the chaos and economic pain of no deal, or to be seen to be giving Britain a helping hand over the cliff.\n\nBut that deal clearly cannot come at any cost. Twenty-six member states will, first, never abandon Ireland when it insists on the need for an operable backstop because, despite the clout of Germany and France, the EU remains a club of small countries, most with populations smaller than 10 million.\n\nEqually important, the European priority remains \u2013 as it has since June 2016 \u2013 the integrity of the EU single market. EU businesses are lobbying their governments, but not in order to persuade them to offer the UK a favourable deal so that sales of BMW cars and prosecco are not hit too hard.\n\nNo, European businesses want their governments to avoid any risk of British companies retaining privileged access to the single market while undercutting them by disobeying its rules: a weakened single market is a far more damaging prospect than even a no-deal Brexit.\n\nFor all those reasons, the EU would, on the whole, prefer Britain to leave now, if possible quite soon. And as Bettel\u2019s irritation showed, it is fast tiring of a psychodrama that is costing it time, money and anxiety, and that is none of its making.", "description": "Luxembourg PM\u2019s exasperation is shared by EU officials and national leaders", "authors": ["Jon Henley", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a61e0aa479e6a64acc90a33fb69773f5483f1214/0_166_4140_2485/master/4140.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2efaa1f5c721f55fbdcbde21123eb2d9", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
