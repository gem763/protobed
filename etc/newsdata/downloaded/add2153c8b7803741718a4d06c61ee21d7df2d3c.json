'We'll look at how we need to play and what the opposition are going to bring to the party and then we'll decide on selection.'\n\nThere will also be at least one injury-enforced change to the matchday 23 after Saracens' Ben Spencer, 27, flew to Japan on Saturday night to replace injured scrum-half Willi Heinz.\n\nAfter one of their most physical displays in history, England are also hoping that Farrell, Jonny May, Kyle Sinckler and Anthony Watson overcome knocks.\n\nManu Tuilagi got England off to the perfect start with a try within the opening two minutes\n\n'Jonny May didn't re-injure his hamstring but he got quite a severe cork (dead leg), as did Owen,' said Jones. 'Anthony Watson is sore. Apart from that, we're pretty good. Sinckler is sore but he should be OK.'\n\nAfter the euphoria of Saturday, Jones tried to bring his players back down to earth. His squad enjoyed some family time on Sunday and are likely to return to regular training on Tuesday \u2014 with one more day to prepare than South Africa.\n\n'We've got another week to go,' said Jones. 'Now it's the attitude of the players, the messaging the staff give the players and the messaging the leadership gives the players. It's about making sure no-one gets too far ahead of themselves and this team has got no reason to, because we haven't achieved what we want.'\n\nMaro Itoje was player of the match after a sensational performance, with and without the ball\n\nWales coach Warren Gatland expects the Springboks to pose a more physical challenge than the All Blacks, saying after his team's defeat: 'They've got the physicality to match England.\n\n'They've got a very good chance.\n\n'They might need to be a bit more expansive. They had a pretty simple game plan tonight with De Allende and the scrums, there was a lot of kicking from De Klerk and Pollard as well.\n\n'It was about making the final for them. We've seen in previous World Cups, sometimes teams play their final in semi-finals and don't always turn up in the final.\n\n'England were outstanding. It will be interesting to see how they are next week.'", "description": "NIK SIMON IN YOKOHAMA: Eddie Jones has insisted he will not be happy until his England side prove they are the best by lifting the World Cup on Saturday.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/22/20258822-0-image-a-37_1572216730239.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
