LVMH declined to comment, while Tiffany did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg News reported earlier that LVMH was holding talks with Tiffany.", "description": "The offer comes at a time when the US luxury jeweller grapples with the impact of tariffs on its exports to China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3531%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a384e2fd8d4c1e959111de254d5e41afa72d3ea2", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
