U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Shinsuke J. Sugiyama signed the agreements at a ceremony at the White House.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge victory for America\u2019s farmers, ranchers and growers. And that\u2019s very important to me,\u201d Trump said in remarks at the signing ceremony. \u201cFrom day one my administration has worked tirelessly to achieve a level playing field for the American worker.\u201d\n\nAmerican farmers bore the brunt of Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement in 2017. One of the new deals does away with $4.3 billion in tariffs on American food products including wine, cheese, nuts, berries, and grains as well as $2.9 billion in tariffs on beef and pork products. The other agreement commits Japan and the U.S. to $40 billion worth of digital trade.\n\nRepublican Senator from Iowa Chuck Grassley called the agreement great news for Iowa farmers and said the new deal \u201cstrengthens\u201d the administration\u2019s negotiating position with China, which has battled with the U.S. on trade since Trump took office.\n\nNevertheless, the agreements keep U.S. tariffs on Japanese automobiles at 2.5 percent, in line with what Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Trump promised him, that tariffs on Japan-made cars would not be hiked up.\n\nThe trade deficit between the U.S. and Japan was $58 billion last year, long a point of contention for Trump.", "description": "The U.S. on Monday signed two trade deals with Japan that are intended to alleviate the hardships American farmers have encountered since President Trump imposed tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports to certain countries.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Andrew C.
