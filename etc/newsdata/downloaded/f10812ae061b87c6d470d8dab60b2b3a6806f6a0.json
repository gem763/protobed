Whatever it is, 25 per cent of it belongs to the Gilberts,' Mr Marinello told the Telegraph.\n\nThe work was originally found in a Somerset manor house in 1913, and made its way into the hands of British art collector Henry Pulitzer, through an art dealer in Isleworth, west London.\n\nIt then spent several years in a Swiss Bank vault, where visiting art experts were able to examine it and create speculation it could be a Leonardo original.\n\nAfter he and partner Elizabeth Meyer passed away the piece was bought by an unnamed international consortium. Along with the Mona Lisa foundation, they unveiled the portrait in 2012 to a storm of publicity and intrigue.\n\nAndrew Gilbert and his wife Karen are now taking the case to an Italian court and have hired Christopher Marinello, an expert in recovering missing works, to work on the case\n\nBut Mr Gilbert claims that Pulitzer sold a 25 per cent share in the painting to Leland Gilbert, a relative of Andrew Gilbert, for \u00a34,000 in 1964.\n\nIf both their stake and the painting can be verified then the couple could earn a fortune.\n\nThe consortium, which is registered to the British Caribbean territory of Anguilla, have denied the Gilberts' claim.\n\nAnother problem comes from the work's validity, and art historian Prof Martin Kemp described as 'a bit of rubbish'.\n\nScientific tests made on 'Isleworth Mona Lisa' (left) and the Louvre Museum da Vinci's masterpiece (right) taken during the unveiling by the Mona Lisa Foundation on September 27, 2012 in Geneva\n\n'It's not the real article for a whole series of reasons. It really isn't a serious runner to be by Leonardo himself.'\n\nKemp disagrees with the idea that da Vinci painted two Mona Lisas over the four years he spent on the work, and adds that his proof is in the painting.\n\n'Examination by infrared and other technical means, shows that it [the Louvre Mona Lisa] underwent an evolution, as all Leonardo's pictures did. The infrared examination of the Isleworth Madonna [as Earlier Mona Lisa is also known] is just tediously exact.'\n\nChristopher Marinello has what he claims to be a document of sale for the 25 per cent share in the Isleworth Mona Lisa which will be presented at the hearing which will take place in March\n\nWhile Andrew Gilbert says he has no idea whether is it genuine, he hopes experts will give a definitive answer.\n\n'My grandfather, along with Henry Pulitzer, was passionate about the painting. He would not have invested in it if he didn't think there was a possibility it was a Leonardo,' he said.\n\nMr Marinello has what he claims to be a document of sale for the 25 per cent share which will be presented at the hearing which will take place in March.\n\nAnother disputed Leonardo, the Salvator Mundi, sold two years ago for $450 million despite doubts about its authenticity.", "description": "Andrew and Karen Gilbert claim they own a 25 per cent stake in the painting, which was found in a Somerset manor house in 1913, and is believed to be an 'early version Mona Lisa'.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/10/19877022-0-image-a-10_1571390847484.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
