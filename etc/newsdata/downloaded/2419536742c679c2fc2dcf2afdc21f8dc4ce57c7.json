Only weeks ago, it was unclear whether the baseless and false attacks were going to damage or boost Biden\u2019s fortunes among Democrats. The poll begins to answer that important question.\n\nMany Democrats have come to Biden\u2019s defense and understand that Trump is attacking him in this way because he is the candidate the Republicans most fear. No one likes to be told who should run and who they should vote for. They particularly don\u2019t like to be told those things by the opposing party.\n\nSome Democrats are also still extraordinarily bitter about how Hillary Clinton was subjected to misinformation and false and baseless charges in 2016. That sense of injustice among Democrats has proved to be critical insulation for Biden.", "description": "", "authors": ["Joe Lockhart", "Cnn.Com Opinions Trump-Is-Doing-Biden-A-Big-Favor-Lockhart Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
