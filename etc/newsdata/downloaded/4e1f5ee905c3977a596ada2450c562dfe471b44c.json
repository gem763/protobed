In 2017, after a group of lawyers in California persuaded a state legislator to consider a bill that would ban confidentiality clauses muzzling sexual harassment victims, Allred denounced the move and threatened to go on the attack. The legislator, Connie Leyva, quickly shelved the idea. (A year later, Leyva introduced such a bill and it was signed into law.)\n\nMaybe the most appalling figure in this constellation of collaborators and enablers is Lisa Bloom, Allred\u2019s daughter. A lawyer likewise known for winning sexual-harassment settlements with nondisclosure agreements, Bloom was retained by Weinstein (who had also bought the movie rights to her book). In a jaw-dropping memo to Weinstein, Bloom itemized her game plan: Initiate \u201ccounterops online campaigns,\u201d place articles in the press painting one of his accusers as a \u201cpathological liar,\u201d start a Weinstein Foundation \u201con gender equality\u201d and hire a \u201creputation management company\u201d to suppress negative articles on Google. Oh, and this gem: \u201cYou and I come out publicly in a pre-emptive interview where you talk about evolving on women\u2019s issues, prompted by death of your mother, Trump pussy grab tape and, maybe, nasty unfounded hurtful rumors about you. \u2026 You should be the hero of the story, not the villain. This is very doable.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe Said\u201d contains a second story of what\u2019s doable against great odds: how two reporters with no connections in Hollywood and with almost no one willing to go on the record were able to penetrate this omert\u00e0 and expose what lay behind it to public scrutiny. This is the book\u2019s deeper level, the story of getting a story, signaled in the choice of chapter titles like \u201cThe First Phone Call\u201d and \u201c\u2018Who Else Is on the Record?\u2019\u201d Kantor and Twohey have crafted their news dispatches into a seamless and suspenseful account of their reportorial journey, a gripping blow-by-blow of how they managed, \u201cworking in the blank spaces between the words,\u201d to corroborate allegations that had been chased and abandoned by multiple journalists before them. \u201cShe Said\u201d reads a bit like a feminist \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men.\u201d\n\nKantor and Twohey take us through the time-consuming, meticulous and often go-nowhere grunt work that\u2019s intrinsic to gathering evidence, winning the trust of gun-shy victims and maneuvering past barricades that block the path to a publishable article. Along the way, we witness how much institutional support such a protracted effort requires. Kantor and Twohey make a point throughout the book of stressing their reliance on a multilayered editorial team, from rigorous young research assistants like Grace Ashford, who combs through government employment data and tracks down a key former assistant from the late 1980s at Miramax, Weinstein\u2019s film production company, to seasoned elder hands like the Times investigative editor Rebecca Corbett. \u201cSixtysomething, skeptical, scrupulous and allergic to flashiness or exaggeration,\u201d Kantor and Twohey write of her, \u201cbut so low profile that she barely surfaced in Google search results. Her ambition was journalistic, not personal.\u201d The night before the first article ran, Corbett remained in the newsroom until dawn, weighing and reweighing every word.\n\nIn this way, \u201cShe Said\u201d is a dead-on description of what makes so-called \u201clegacy\u201d journalism so powerful. Ironically, the #MeToo movement that Kantor and Twohey\u2019s articles about Weinstein helped launch promulgates an opposite message: that the best way to bring injustice to light is to get rid of the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d and let rip on Twitter, that we\u2019ll only get to the \u201ctruth\u201d when the Establishment is brought down and no one is in charge.\n\n[ Read: \u201cI\u2019m Harvey Weinstein \u2014 you know what I can do.\u201d ]\n\nIt may be, as the political writer Lee Smith argued in The Weekly Standard, that some journalists had protected Weinstein partly out of a craven illusion that the Hollywood rainmaker would someday make rain for them, buying their articles for high-grossing films. And no doubt the #MeToo movement has prompted the mainstream media to take these stories more seriously. Would Vanity Fair\u2019s editor today omit allegations of sexual assault from a profile of Jeffrey Epstein, as happened in 2003? Nonetheless, the big-league sexual predators who have been brought to justice in the #MeToo era have been brought there not by internet whisper campaigns but by good old-fashioned reporting: O\u2019Reilly by The Times, Nassar by The Indianapolis Star, Epstein by The Miami Herald, Roy Moore by The Washington Post, Weinstein by The Times and The New Yorker. \u201cThe Weinstein story had impact,\u201d the authors note, \u201cin part because it had achieved something that, in 2018, seemed rare and precious: broad consensus on the facts.\u201d", "description": "The new book, by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, revisits their landmark sexual-assault investigation and exposes the powerful people who protected Weinstein for years.", "authors": ["Susan Faludi"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/books/review/Faludi1/Faludi2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
