Despite his early stumbles, Mr. Johnson is still outpolling his opponents.", "description": "The prime minister was expected to take his call for an early election to voters in northern England on Thursday, but the initiative is with the opposition.", "authors": ["Benjamin Mueller"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/05/world/05brexit1/05brexit1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
