(Marvin Fong/Cleveland Plain Dealer/AP)\n\nThe 49,000 workers who walked off their jobs at GM factories at midnight Sunday waded into a charged political arena that has put issues around work and livability at the front of a fierce national discussion.\n\nRepresentatives for both the company and United Auto Workers, which is leading the strike, expressed hopes for a near-term fix, but details remained scarce. President Trump also weighed in, saying Monday afternoon that \u201cI am sad to see the strike. Hopefully it is going to be a quick one.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters, he offered the possibility of federal mediation, but Democrats urged the union to continue its fight.\n\nThe last national work stoppage at General Motors, in 2007, lasted about two days, but it\u2019s unclear how long the current impasse might persist. The strike has caught the attention of numerous political leaders, particularly Democrats running for the White House. Both political parties believe the 2020 presidential election could hinge on the economy\u2019s performance in a number of key states, including Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and a recent manufacturing revival in those states has shown signs of reversal.\n\nGM has been a particular focus for the White House and lawmakers from both parties, who have questioned some of the company\u2019s decisions, particularly related to plant closures.\n\nThe workers\u2019 strike drew immediate support from many prominent liberals and Democrats, including 2020 contenders Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, as well as a vague exhortation from Trump for the two sides to \u201cGet together and make a deal!\u201d\n\nGM and UAW officials sat down on Monday to resume contract talks that had been ongoing since mid-July. Before the latest round of talks, the UAW released a letter it sent to GM that said the company had only made a serious offer just two hours before the contract expired Saturday night.\n\n\u201cWe have many important topics to discuss including wage increases, the wage progression for new hires, health care and prescription drug benefits, skilled trades issues, jobs security, profit-sharing and the treatment of temporary employees,\u201d the letter said.\n\nProduction at about 33 manufacturing plants in nine states and other work at 22 distribution warehouses was expected to be halted by the strike, making the action a severe impediment to GM\u2019s ability to produce automobiles.\n\nWorkers are forgoing their paychecks for each day they do not work, though they will receive a weekly $250 stipend from a fund that UAW keeps for strikes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we\u2019re out here, no one wants to be here, but we\u2019ve got to do what we\u2019ve got to do to secure a future for us. And not just us, but for future generations,\u201d said Celso Duque, a 22-year veteran of GM at the Detroit-Hamtramck plant, one of four that the company recently announced plans to shutter. \u201cWe hope it doesn\u2019t go a long time. But I don\u2019t think it will be like 2007, with a two-day strike.\u201d\n\nDuque said that priorities for the union included better wages, health care, job security and keeping plants like Hamtramck open.\n\nThose factory closures, announced by the company in 2018, loom in the background of contract negotiations, as the strike unfolds at a fraught time for workers and the U.S. economy at large.\n\nGM made $8.1 billion in profit after taxes last year, leading to workers receiving checks of up to $11,000 each as part of a profit-sharing agreement the company and its unionized workers struck in the previous contract.\n\nBut the plant closures, as the company continues to wind down car models like the Chevrolet Cruze that have fallen out of favor, and to prepare for an uncertain technological future, hinted at more troubling economic signs.\n\nThese broader concerns are likely acting on both parties as they seek to leverage a more favorable contract for the next four years, analysts say.\n\n\u201cGM is not sure what the demand for cars will be in the years ahead given possibility of autonomous vehicles and ride sharing,\u201d Harry C. Katz, a professor of labor relations, law and history at Cornell University, said. \u201cMeanwhile, workers are looking are recent profits from GM and they\u2019re pretty strong. And they\u2019ve seen executive pay get high. So they think times are good \u2014 happy times are back. They want to get their fair shake and also recover from deep concessions they made in 2011.\u201d\n\nWorkers showed their solidarity at plants around the country as they closed Sunday night. At the Hamtramck factory, cars and trucks honked their horns as they passed picketers in red shirts. Cheers greeted workers as they left an assembly plant in Fort Wayne, Ind., and Parma, Ohio, according to local news reports.\n\nA lot of cars driving by and honking in support of @UAW workers on strike at @GM\u2019s Flint Assembly plant in Michigan (a highly-profitable and important plant for the company that produces pickups). pic.twitter.com/mJliVp8cHd \u2014 Michael Wayland (@MikeWayland) September 16, 2019\n\nThe strike also comes amid mounting legal troubles for the UAW.\n\nVance Pearson, a regional director for the union, was arrested and charged last week with embezzlement, money laundering and other charges for using union money on lavish personal expenses, according to federal prosecutors. The FBI raided the home of Gary Jones, the president of the UAW, in connection with the probe.\n\nThat legal action represents a significant challenge for the union at the moment, experts said.\n\n\u201cLeaders have to show that they\u2019re independent of management, and show they\u2019re tough and, in some ways, respond to members\u2019 concerns their leaders have been co-opted,\u201d Katz said. \u201cHaving a strike is a way to show you\u2019re tough and independent.\u201d\n\nGM said in a statement that it had offered to make $7 billion in investments and create 5,400 jobs, including introducing electric trucks, opening a battery cell manufacturing site and investing in eight existing facilities.\n\nThe company declined to give specifics, but said it had offered wage increases, continued profit-sharing and the ability to retain health-care benefits to its workers.\n\n\u201cWe presented a strong offer that improves wages, benefits and grows U.S. jobs in substantive ways and it is disappointing that the UAW leadership has chosen to strike,\u201d spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan said in a statement. \u201cWe have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency. Our goal remains to build a strong future for our employees and our business.\u201d\n\nAuto workers deserve good wages, comprehensive benefits, and economic security. I stand with @UAW as they strike to get what they deserve, and urge GM to come to the table and negotiate in good faith. https://t.co/VRmL7VzSzt \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 16, 2019\n\nThe company says its hourly workers make an average of $90,000 a year. The 49,000 full-time and temporary workers represented by the UAW make up about half of its workforce.\n\nAnalysts note that American automakers face higher labor costs than foreign car companies that have opened assembly plants in the United States, none of which are unionized.\n\nAccording to the Center for Automotive Research, a nonpartisan think tank that studies the industry, GM pays an average of $13 more an hour for its workforce than foreign competitors that produce cars in the United States \u2014 the highest gap of the big three car companies.\n\n\u201cThe automakers will be seeking to improve their competitive position vis-\u00e0-vis the international automakers in the United States during these negotiations,\u201d the think tank said in a recent report.\n\nUAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg declined to give specifics on the union\u2019s contractual demands but said UAW was prepared to weather a long strike if need be, with $750 million in the fund it stocks for worker pay.\n\n\u201cThere are major issues out there, including wages, job security, quality health care, and seniority for temporary workers,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cFor our members, when GM was faced with bankruptcy in its darkest days, our membership stood up to help the company. All they want to know is if a very profitable company that has had record profits for years based on that sacrifice they made will stand up for them.\u201d", "description": "GM had a banner year in 2018.
