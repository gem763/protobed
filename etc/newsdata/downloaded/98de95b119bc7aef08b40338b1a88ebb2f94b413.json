Illumina (ILMN) has been at the forefront of that revolution, notes growth stock expert Ian Wyatt, editor of Million Dollar Portfolio.\n\nA maker and provider of sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis, there aren\u2019t many genetic laboratories that don\u2019t used Illumina\u2019s equipment. That helped push the stock into massively overvalued territory \u2014 at least until this past July.\n\nMore from Ian Wyatt: AbbVie: The Forest for the Trees\n\nWhen Illumina announced its latest earnings, revenue growth had slowed substantially. Thanks to some recent technological innovations, newer, more efficient sequencers have been expected to hit the markets for some time now. Funding for basic sciences, a major source of demand for sequencers, has also slowed down, denting demand.\n\nAs a result, revenue was down 1% sequentially and only up 1% over the year-ago quarter. So, while EPS we up 27% sequentially and 41% year-over-year, investors got antsy and sent the stock plunging. I believe that sets up a rare opportunity to buy Illumina at a discount to itself and many of its peers.\n\nIllumina had been trading as high as 65 times earnings, as are many of its peers, but it has come to do a relatively more reasonable 48 times. That because investors still have high confidence in its growth prospects, despite the recent setback.\n\nAnd this is only a setback. Right now, Illumina and Pacific Biosciences (PACB) are in the midst of a merger, which is expected to close before the end of the year.\n\nPacific has made it a goal to reduce the cost of reading a human genome and, so far, it\u2019s been successful. Sequencing a genome had cost $12,000 as recently as early last year but fell to $7,000 by the end of 2018. This year, the cost has fallen to just $1,000.\n\nSee also: 5 Favorites for Value Investors\n\nThat\u2019s mostly thanks to improvements in Pacific\u2019s Sequel II system. Sequel II allows for long-reads, effectively sequencing an entire genome.\n\nIllumina\u2019s equipment is designed for short-reads, which are fine for speed and accuracy when you\u2019re looking at specific parts of a gene sequence, but it can\u2019t read as much as 9% of a human genome. And it\u2019s not good for non-human genomes at all.\n\nSo, by combining Pacific Bioscience\u2019s and Illumina\u2019s technology, you\u2019d have the best of both worlds, radically improving efficiency and accuracy while cutting cost. And, despite Pacific\u2019s excellent technology, it\u2019s struggled to achieve profitability, making the merger an ideal situation for both companies.\n\nAnd while demand for sequencers for applications like ancestry testing may be slowing down as the machines become more efficient, it isn\u2019t going away. Medical and research use, despite lumpiness in government funding, isn\u2019t going to go away either.\n\nSo, while I understand a $300 stock may be a bit rich for some, this is an excellent buy opportunity, especially if your portfolio could use some exposure to next-generation technology. Recommended Action: Buy up to $350.\n\nMore From MoneyShow.com:", "description": "For more than a decade now genomic medicine has been revolutionizing the way we diagnose and treat disease.
