The destruction of the Twin Towers left a glaring hole in the New York City skyline.\n\nFollowing the attacks, movies and television shows replaced images of or cut scenes involving the buildings.\n\nIn the intervening 18 years, New York has rebuilt the area around ground zero and delivered a yearly tribute in memory of the nearly 3,000 lives lost as a result of those attacks.\n\nFor more stories go to www.BuinesssInsider.co.za.\n\nThe 9/11 terrorist attacks transformed New York City and its skyline.\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragedy, smoke filled the air, casting a grey film over the city's Financial District. As the smog began to lift, New Yorkers were confronted with the glaring disappearance of the Twin Towers, a structural duo that had become synonymous with the city itself. Movies and television shows scrambled to replace or eliminate scenes of the buildings, and video games and animated features changed their storylines to reflect their absence.\n\nBy 2002, construction began on 7 World Trade Center - one of seven new buildings at the original World Trade Center site. In the coming years, the skyline made way for cranes and steel columns as builders laid the foundation for the complex. By the end of 2014, three buildings in the site's master plan were standing. The fourth building, 3 World Trade Center, opened on June 11, 2018.\n\nThe most iconic of these renovated structures, One World Trade Center, is now the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. At 1,776 feet high, the tower is a glaring reminder of the city's reconstruction and rebirth.\n\nThe following images trace the evolution of New York's skyline before the attacks, on the day of 9/11, and on every anniversary thereafter. In addition to huge structural changes, the images depict citywide tributes to the nearly 3,000 lives lost.\n\nSeptember 11, 2001\n\nSeptember 11, 2002\n\nSeptember 11, 2003\n\nNew York City commemorates the attacks each year by casting 88 searchlights into the sky, creating two columns of light to represent the Twin Towers. The installation, known as Tribute in Light, started on the first anniversary of 9/11 and has since become an annual memorial.\n\nSeptember 11, 2004\n\nSeptember 11, 2007\n\nSeptember 11, 2008\n\nSeptember 11, 2009\n\nSeptember 11, 2010\n\nSeptember 11, 2011\n\nSince 2011, politicians have not been allowed to read names or deliver remarks at the 9/11 commemoration service in order to preserve the apolitical nature of the ceremony.\n\nSeptember 11, 2012\n\nSeptember 11, 2013\n\nSeptember 11, 2014\n\nAs New Yorkers gathered for another year of memorial services, former President Obama delivered a speech at the Pentagon in Washington, DC. \"Beginning tomorrow, there will be teenagers - young adults - who were born after 9/11,\" Obama said. \"While these young Americans did not know the horrors of that day, their lives have been shaped by all the days since.\"\n\nSeptember 11, 2015\n\nSeptember 11, 2016\n\nSeptember 11, 2017\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivered remarks at the Pentagon's 9/11 memorial service last year. \"We're gathered here today to remember a morning that started very much like this one,\" he said. \"On that day, not only did the world change, but we all changed. Our eyes were opened to the depths of the evil we face. But in that hour of darkness, we also came together with renewed purpose. Our differences never looked so small, our common bonds never felt so strong.\"", "description": "These skyline images show the disappearance of the Twin Towers, followed by the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3853/947246444ec0496890ad9cc22f540e76.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
