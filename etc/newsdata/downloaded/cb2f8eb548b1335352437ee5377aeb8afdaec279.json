Brent is currently about 23% lower than its peak for this year in April.\n\n\"Next year the curtailment of demand growth coming from lower GDP (gross domestic product) growth expectations and continuation of the U.S.-China trade war could shave more oil demand from the market,\" its analysts said.\n\nData due this week on U.S. inventory levels will be delayed by a day to Wednesday and Thursday because of the U.S. Labour Day holiday on Monday.\n\nU.S. crude oil stockpiles likely declined for a third straight week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.
