I was saying I quite like the kit,\u201d says, she laughing at her switch from red to white. \u201cMy family are all right [with the move], my dad is a Spurs fan. My brother doesn\u2019t like me any more. But the club is brilliant.\n\n\u201cThere was just something about Tottenham. I had been hearing whispers about Tottenham for quite a few years. It\u2019s a big club and they should be in the FA WSL. They are one of the biggest clubs in the world and the future is really bright. It\u2019s a bit of a pull.\u201d\n\nThe impact of England success on women's football \u2013 from top to bottom Read more\n\nWith all tickets for the Stamford Bridge opener free, there is an expectation of a shortfall in capacity. However, with the Manchester derby at the Etihad expected to break the previous league record of 5,265 who watched Arsenal win the league at the Amex last season, there is a hope that south London could outdo their northern rivals.\n\nFor the Chelsea and England centre-back Millie Bright, it feels right to progress after the summer\u2019s World Cup in France. \u201cIt\u2019s a crucial time,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we step back now and don\u2019t push on, we\u2019ll lose that window to really push forward in the women\u2019s game and get the attraction.\n\n\u201cOff the back of the World Cup, now is the time to keep people invested in the game and not just at national level but at club level, and keep people coming along and watching.\u201d\n\nLarge crowds matter. \u201cWhen I came to Chelsea and England, playing in big games, that got me excited \u2013 you play with no fear then. So in a way, it would be, not foolish, but silly to think Spurs are going to be intimidated by the fans. As a player, that would spark my drive and I\u2019d be: \u2018I\u2019m ready for this.\u2019 You\u2019ve got no fear in that game whatsoever and you\u2019re going to go and prove yourself to thousands and thousands of people.\u201d\n\nThe bigger attendances, the sponsorship deals, the perks of being a professional: for Davison, at 32, the wait has been a lengthy one. \u201cIs this not what women\u2019s football deserves?\u201d she says. \u201cWith the talent that is in the game now? It should have been like this a long time ago but we have it now and hopefully the opportunities will increase and I\u2019ve no doubt they will.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 16 my dad was told women\u2019s football would never go professional. Now look at it. We\u2019re sitting in a room here full of journalists. It\u2019s unbelievable.\n\n\u201cI was told I would never make it into first-team football, that I\u2019d never play for England and that women\u2019s football would never be professional and now I\u2019m sitting here in St George\u2019s Park wearing a Tottenham Hotspur shirt \u2013 so happy days.\u201d\n\nHaving had to travel to the United States in search of professionalism in her youth, Davison is excited by the future that exists now for young players. \u201cIt\u2019s biased isn\u2019t it, but this is probably the most exciting league in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cYou look at the players that we\u2019re bringing over, big players who are some of the best in the world.\n\n\u201cI went to America and I went and played with Marta, but now everyone wants to come here. It\u2019s setting a benchmark. America set a benchmark for us. We\u2019re now doing the same. Commercially, it\u2019s just getting bigger and bigger.\u201d\n\nNow she is a part of moulding the future. Having coached for 10 years, she runs sessions for elite kids \u2013 boys and girls \u2013 including the children of her former teammate Katie Chapman. She can see a better generation arriving.\n\n\u201cThey are training more, three or four times a week, they are doing extra. We didn\u2019t do that. They are getting more exposure, more information. The talent is already there and then you\u2019re getting the development, more touches on the ball, you\u2019re just going to get a better player.\u201d\n\nShe had to stop playing with boys eventually, but kept playing \u201csecretly for a long time with my friends on the local astro. That gave me the traits of my game because you can\u2019t just sprint past a guy because he\u2019s quicker so I had to use trickery. That\u2019s moulded me as a player. That\u2019s what I\u2019m like, beating people with trickery and not just speed.\u201d", "description": "Hopes for big attendance at Women\u2019s Super League match excites Tottenham winger \u2013 a Double winner when with Chelsea", "authors": ["Suzanne Wrack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66529f6b8b100391f7689c4ae1231d682dfd113f/0_151_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f4a0d371cbb4806421b11d462df2a020", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
