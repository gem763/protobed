If you watch the best teams they take more risks with the ball, they make more runs in behind and that\u2019s part of the process for the boys.\u201d\n\nAt the club\u2019s annual staff meeting, executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward defended Solskjaer\u2019s credentials and the club\u2019s poor start to the campaign.\n\nSolskjaer said the overhaul of the squad is a long-term project and will need at least two more transfer windows to build a squad capable of competing for trophies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made some decisions that maybe in the short term would harm us but we know in the long term will benefit us and that\u2019s part of the plan,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe results are always the main thing, we can move forward quicker if we get results and performances. But I\u2019m sure that we will get there.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer has already ruled out goalkeeper David De Gea and midfielder Paul Pogba from the weekend\u2019s clash against Liverpool due to injuries, but said defenders Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Luke Shaw could be available for selection.", "description": "Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer believes he is the right man for the rebuilding job at Old Trafford despite overseeing the club's worst start to a top-flight season in 30 years.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442248957&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0VU", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
