A few days ago, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis refused to comment about Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president, and Jennifer Rubin didn\u2019t understand why Mattis wasn\u2019t joining the Left\u2019s impeachment push:\n\nWhat possible rationale does Mattis have now for remaining silent? \u2014 Jennifer Rubin (@JRubinBlogger) September 28, 2019\n\n\u201cJournalist\u201d Soledad O\u2019Brien wondered about a reason for that:\n\nPeople can say what they want about Mattis, but anything involving the word \u201ccoward\u201d doesn\u2019t seem accurate:\n\nI've seen some foolish responses from the media on Twitter, but yours hands down tops them all.\n\nTo suggest a 3 war Marine Corps General is a coward is sheer idiocy.\n\nCongrats @soledadobrien! \u2014 Republicanvet R U aFredo? (@Republicanvet91) September 29, 2019\n\nIt sure is something else.\n\nYes, Soledad. General James Mattis is a \u201ccoward.\u201d He got these awards and military decorations out of a gum ball machine. https://t.co/soogopswbx pic.twitter.com/JapZueQKth \u2014 Ian McKelvey (@ian_mckelvey) September 29, 2019\n\nCan you believe that Soledaddy is suggesting that General Mattis is a coward? https://t.co/DuSKMQIywl pic.twitter.com/8ERvZPxToQ \u2014 The Morning Spew (@TheMorningSpew) September 28, 2019\n\nYou are called Mattis a coward?
