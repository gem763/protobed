REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe Trump administration said on Monday that Megvii and seven other Chinese companies were targeted because they were implicated in Beijing\u2019s repression of Muslim minority populations in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in the far west of the country.\n\nIn an emailed statement in response to a request for comment on the Alibaba-backed Megvii IPO, Goldman said it was \u201cevaluating in light of the recent developments\u201d. Sources had previously told Reuters the listing was scheduled for Hong Kong in the fourth quarter and might raise as much as $1 billion.\n\nRisk consultants and Silicon Valley lawyers said that other U.S. companies involved with the blacklisted Chinese firms, whether as investors or as underwriters, are also likely to reevaluate their relationships.\n\nGoldman is a joint sponsor of the Megvii IPO, alongside Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co, which both declined to comment.\n\nGoldman had thoroughly evaluated the Megvii deal before initially signing onto it using its usual due diligence process, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nKnown in the artificial intelligence business for its facial recognition platform Face++, Megvii will become the first Chinese AI firm to go public if the deal goes ahead. The company provides facial recognition and other AI technology to governments and companies including Alibaba, Ant Financial, Lenovo Group Ltd and Huawei.\n\nMUSLIM MISTREATMENT\n\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce on Monday barred eight companies, as well as 20 Chinese government entities, from buying U.S. technology without U.S. government approval. That will include high-powered computer chips made by U.S. companies such as Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm, which are considered critical for building and operating many AI systems.\n\nThe government said the 28 blacklisted firms and government entities were \u201cimplicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups\u201d.\n\nThe blacklist was announced a day after the U.S. government imposed visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist Party officials it believes responsible for the detention or abuse of Muslims in Xinjiang.\n\nU.N. experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs, and members of other largely Muslim minority groups, have been detained in camps in the remote region.\n\nBeijing denies any mistreatment at the camps, which it says provide vocational training to help stamp out religious extremism and teach new work skills.\n\nU.S. Senator Marco Rubio, who has been seeking to spotlight both the easy access that Chinese companies have been given to U.S. markets and human rights abuses in Xinjiang, said the government\u2019s move had been long overdue. \u201cWe should continue to do more to hold Chinese government and Communist Party officials accountable for potential crimes against humanity being committed in Xinjiang,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cPUTTING THEMSELVES AT RISK\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Chinese and some foreign investors have poured money into startup technology firms that specialize in facial and voice recognition software, as well as other surveillance equipment and software. They have been buoyed by China\u2019s plans to build a ubiquitous CCTV surveillance network.\n\nAnother company being added to the U.S. government\u2019s blacklist,\u201d SenseTime, is among the world\u2019s most highly valued artificial intelligence firms and counts marquee U.S. technology investors Tiger Global and Silver Lake Partners among its backers. Fidelity, the U.S. mutual fund firm, is also a SenseTime investor, along with Qualcomm.\n\nRisk consultants say that investors and underwriters have jumped into the sector without fully assessing the dangers both to their reputations and to the valuations of the companies concerned.\n\n\u201cThere has been a dearth of adequate due diligence performed on these companies from both a national security and a human rights perspective,\u201d said Roger Robinson, president and CEO of Washington DC-based risk consultancy RWR Advisory Group, and a former senior director of international economic affairs at the National Security Council.\n\nHe said that investors and others involved with these Chinese companies \u201cmay well be putting themselves at risk.\u201d\n\nSilver Lake, Tiger Global and Qualcomm all declined to comment. Fidelity didn\u2019t immediately return a call seeking a comment.\n\n\u201cThere will be a judgment call as to whether any US investor would want to be associated with such businesses,\u201d said Rocky Lee, managing partner of the Silicon Valley office of law firm King & Wood Mallesons. \u201cI believe you will see some \u2018quiet\u2019 exiting by US funds and possibly LPs, at least those U.S. investors who feel strongly that owning companies engaging in these activities are either immoral or politically incorrect.\u201d", "description": "Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Tuesday it was reviewing its involvement in Megvii Technology Ltd's planned initial public offering (IPO) after the U.S. government placed the Chinese artificial intelligence firm on a human rights blacklist.", "authors": ["Joshua Franklin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438638608&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971Q4", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
