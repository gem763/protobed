'She knows more than most about the man Matt really is, and when she finally speaks out, it will destroy him.'\n\nLauer, 61, was fired from NBC amid the shocking sexual misconduct allegations in 2017.\n\nFormer Today show anchor Ann Curry says if she revealed all she knew about allegations against Matt Lauer, it would 'destroy' him\n\nCurry worked with Lauer on Today from 1997 to 2012 but says hasn't revealed all on the extent of the allegations he faces, spanning from sexual misconduct and harassment\n\nCurry also backed Ronan Farrow's bombshell book Catch and Kill, insisting that complaints about Lauer's conduct with women were well-known but swept under the rug at the Peacock network.\n\n'I told them that they had a problem in him,' Curry told Farrow in the book. 'That he had a problem with women. That they had to keep an eye on him.'\n\nShe said she reported him to the high-up executives at the network after a colleague told her Lauer exposed himself to her. She didn't reveal that accuser's name but reported to officials Lauer was a problem.\n\nHowever, NBC fired back against that claim, saying Curry didn't disclose the 'specific' complaint.\n\n'By her own account, Curry relayed no specific complaint, nor did she say Lauer\u2019s \"problem\" regarded any specific workplace misconduct,' NBC News President Noah Oppenheim wrote in a memo to staffers.\n\nIn Farrow's book he names for the first time Lauer accuser Brooke Nevils who accused him of raping her at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.\n\n'It was was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent. It was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex,' she said.\n\nSources also reveal that Annette Roque wanted to divorce Lauer before the sexual misconduct allegations surfaced and before he was axed from NBC in 2017. A source said Roque has 'been through hell' over the last five years of the marriage\n\nDespite 'cracks' early on in their marriage the couple stayed together for Lauer's career and for the sake of their three children - Jack, 18, Romy, 16, and Thijs, 12. Lauer pictured with his children in January 2016\n\nAs Lauer's career spiraled, his marriage only became rockier. Lauer and his wife of 20 years Annette Roque saw their marriage reportedly crumble with the release of the extramarital affairs allegations.\n\nBut sources reveal that even before the bombshell accusations came out, Roque, 52, had wanted to leave the marriage, but stayed for the sake of their wholesome public image.\n\n'Annette wanted out of the marriage for a long time,' an insider told US Weekly Wednesday.\n\n'She stayed for Matt's career - and, more important, for their kids,' the source said.\n\nThe couple share three children together, Jack, 18, Romy, 16, and Thijs, 12.\n\nBut Roque has 'been through hell' over the last five years of the marriage, especially after the NBC anchor was axed from the network.\n\n'Matt has always been a ladies' man, and there were affairs int he beginning,' the source said.\n\nJust last week former NBC employee Brooke Nevils (pictured center) was identified as one of Matt Lauer's accusers. She claims he raped her at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics\n\nAt one point Lauer vowed to change and Roque 'chose to believe Matt's denials'.\n\nBut eventually living with Lauer became unbearable saying the father-of-three was extremely tidy and controlling.\n\n'Matt's a total control freak. Nothing was ever out of place, and he expected this same quality in his wife too,' the source said.\n\nRoque filed for divorce in July and the papers were signed by a Suffolk County Supreme Court Judge last month.\n\nRoque has been notably silent as her husband became embroiled in the misconduct scandal, but she broke her silence last week when Nevils came forward with the rape allegation.\n\n'In response to your inquiry, our client has asked us to tell you that now that the parties are officially divorced, her priority and only concern is for their wonderful children. Our client will make no further statements,' Roque's lawyer John M. Teitler said to People magazine when asked about that allegation.\n\nAfter Nevils rape allegation was publicized, Lauer, who has been laying low over the past year, came forward to deny the accusation as 'categorically false'.\n\n'The story Brooke tells is filled with false details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter. Nothing could be further from the truth,' he said.", "description": "Ann Curry says she would 'destroy' disgraced NBC host Matt Lauer if she told all on her 15 years of working with him, as sources shed light on his hellish marriage with Annette Roque.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/02/19816350-0-image-a-33_1571275522496.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
