Ultimately you're going to have to choose one or the other, but we're 50-50 in the top team,\" said Andrew Mackenzie, in reference to the 10-person executive leadership team that sits below him.\n\nOne highly rated, female, external option, Shell's Zoe Yujnovich, appears to be off the market after winning a big promotion to Shell headquarters at The Hague earlier this month.\n\nA former Rio Tinto executive, Ms Yujnovich has been Shell's Australian chairman for just 30 months but will in January start a global role as Shell's executive vice-president of conventional oil and gas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In terms of the external market, we keep our eye on the external market as part of the process as well,\" said Ken MacKenzie on Thursday.\n\nThe chairman didn't give any sense that a change of CEO might be imminent.\n\n\"Like any board, our most important task is planning for the succession of our CEO. So it's our normal process, and it's an ongoing process,\" Mr MacKenzie said.\n\nBHP's Australian shareholders will get a chance to front the board when the company holds its annual meeting of Australian shareholders in Sydney on November 7.", "description": "BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie believes his successor must have a detailed understanding of minerals and geology.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7185%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_124%2C$y_4/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/687cdbc3d846b877ab2dcde3d1dc0cf67a7ebd35", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
