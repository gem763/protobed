She noted that arbitration silences women and their stories.\n\n\"I'm glad she's been given her due,\" Nicole Kidman, who plays Carlson in \"Bombshell\" (out Dec. 20), said at a Los Angeles screening of the film Sunday night.\n\nCarlson was also prevented from speaking out about \"The Loudest Voice,\" Showtime's mini series about Ailes, which had Naomi Watts playing her.\n\n\"It\u2019s frustrating cause I can say, 'Hey wait a minute, you know, that was my life!' \" Carlson said. \"But the trailer got a tremendous amount of attention and for me, that\u2019s what this is all about.\"\n\nDespite her frustrations at having to stay silenced on projects about Ailes, Carlson is happy that people are finally talking about it.\n\n\"Most importantly, if it gives courage to men and women who are facing these kinds of situations to come forward, then that\u2019s the extra bonus,\"Carlson said. \"I really feel like nobody would have done these movies three years ago when I jumped off the cliff all by myself in July of 2016.\"\n\nCarlson hailed both \"Bombshell\" and \"Voice\" as \"great because they are keeping the dialogue going in a big, huge way.\" She added: \"The visual medium can be so much more powerful, especially with this topic, because there are so many myths and misunderstandings.\n\n\"If I had told you three years ago that Showtime was going to do a miniseries about me and that (director) Jay Roach was going to do a potential blockbuster movie on this topic, you would have laughed at me,\" she continued. \"Let me also say, the idea that Naomi Watts and Nicole Kidman are playing me \u2013 that\u2019s surreal on its face.\"\n\nContributing: Erin Jensen, Andrea Mandell", "description": "Gretchen Carlson says she's frustrated that she can't participate in projects about Roger Ailes because of her settlement in 2017.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/14/USAT/33bb7880-cbb0-4f9c-99c1-a505ce5e112c-AP_Miss_America_Carlson.JPG?crop=3289,1851,x0,y224&width=2639&height=1851&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
