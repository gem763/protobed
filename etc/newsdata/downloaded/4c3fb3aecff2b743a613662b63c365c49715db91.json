Unfortunately, the Nationals and their young cleanup hitter seemingly forgot to pack any punch in their bats for the trip home.\n\nAnd now, the series is tied at two games apiece.\n\nBefore the Nationals played Game 3 on Soto's 21st birthday Friday, Washington manager Dave Martinez quipped, \"He's been really good. I just hope he hits at the age of 21.\"\n\nHe hasn't yet.\n\nSoto went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts that night, Washington was hitless in 10 at-bats with runners in scoring position and Houston secured a 4-1 victory.\n\nOn Saturday night, Soto went 0 for 3 and the Nationals mustered only four hits in an 8-1 defeat. Washington was 1 for 9 with RISP, the lone hit a line drive by Anthony Rendon off reliever Will Harris in the sixth inning that loaded the bases with one out for Soto.\n\nDuring a postseason in which Soto got the key hit in a wild-card win over Milwaukee and brought Washington back with a homer off Clayton Kershaw in Game 5 against the Dodgers, the Nationals seemed poised to put a huge dent in Houston's 4-0 lead.\n\nSoto hit the first pitch to first base, an unsatisfying RBI groundout that preceded an inning-ending strikeout by Howie Kendrick. It was a sequence that typified how things have turned for Washington \u2014 not just because Soto suddenly can't hit but because Kendrick's grand slam propelled the Nationals past Los Angeles in the deciding game of the NLDS.\n\nPITCHER WITH A BAT\n\nWashington's Game 5 starter, Max Scherzer, is more talented at the plate than most pitchers. He hit .243 last season and owns a respectable .193 career batting average.\n\n\"When you get in the box you want to contribute offensively, whether it's getting a bunt down or moving a runner or just trying to find a way to get on base,\" Scherzer said. \"I love the hitting aspect of the game. I love that I get to hit.\"\n\nGerrit Cole homered three times over five seasons with Pittsburgh, but he's not exactly brimming with enthusiasm over the prospect of stepping into the batter's box against Scherzer in Game 5.\n\n\"I think I fall in line with pretty much everyone else, that it's probably not the most enjoyable experience of all time,\" Cole said.\n\nLONG NIGHT\n\nFriday night's game lasted more than four hours and stretched into Saturday morning before the final out was made.\n\nThat's a long time for a nine-inning matchup.\n\n\"We're in the World Series,\" Martinez said. \"I know a lot of it has to do with TV, commercials, and things of that nature.\"\n\nEven from the dugout, a game like that is tough to watch without the aid of caffeine. Unfortunately for Martinez, he's been forced to cut back on coffee following a recent heart procedure.\n\n\"I can't drink caffeine anymore, but a couple cups of coffee would have done wonders for me during the game,\" he said with a grin.\n\nHe probably could have used a shot or two of espresso Saturday night for a game that lasted 3 hours, 48 minutes and ended shortly before midnight.\n\nCOOL WITH GOMES\n\nScherzer has developed a strong comfort level pitching to Kurt Suzuki in terms of \"just being in sync of what pitch to throw,\" the three-time Cy Young Award winner said.\n\nWith Suzuki nursing a hip injury and unlikely to play Sunday night, Scherzer doesn't mind at all firing the ball at catcher Yan Gomes.\n\n\"Yan is very astute to the game of being able to watch what's going on and how I sequence guys and what we want to do,\" Scherzer said. \"He's catching (Saturday night) so he's going to be able to see whatever is going on, get his feet wet.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
