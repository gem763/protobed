According to a Morning Consult poll conducted from September 24 to 26, 43 percent of the public now backs impeachment proceedings. That figure has increased seven points from an earlier Morning Consult poll, carried out from September 20 to 22. Meanwhile, an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, conducted the day before the whistleblower report became public, finds that voters are roughly split on the subject. 49 percent support impeachment, and 46 percent do not.\n\nOne possible reason for the increase in public support for impeachment is so obvious it almost doesn\u2019t need an explanation. Trump is not having a very good week: As a call record and now a declassified whistleblower report attest, Trump asked the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate the son of a political enemy \u2014 Hunter Biden \u2014 with the assistance of the Justice Department and Rudy Giuliani. Trump later tried to withhold military aid from Ukraine. The unspooling crisis encourages talk of impeachment, and a number of House Democrats have come out in support of beginning the process. But the party isn\u2019t unified on the matter, due perhaps to fears of voter backlash.\n\nBy now throwing her support behind an impeachment inquiry, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has helped shift public opinion in tandem with media coverage of Trump\u2019s misconduct. But she is an extremely late convert to the cause of impeachment, despite the president\u2019s corruption and alleged sexual violence. Her ambivalence provided shelter to more moderate and conservative members of the party, who think an impeachment inquiry would cost them their seats. Whether these members will follow Pelosi\u2019s lead is an open question.\n\nThough no one can say with certainty that voter enthusiasm for impeachment will continue to grow, the president\u2019s handling of the Ukraine scandal has clearly harmed him. A good number of Democrats already seem to realize that the story leaves them with no option but to endorse impeachment proceedings. Over half of House Democrats now support an inquiry, as CNN has reported, and that includes members like Representative Antonio Delgado, who represent key swing districts. Some now look like impeachment hipsters \u2014 fans before it became popular with everyone else. Once pilloried for her profanity-laden impeachment demand, Rashida Tlaib is having a moment. The Democratic representative from Michigan is selling \u201cImpeach The MF\u201d t-shirts, a callback to her iconic rant. (If a lowly blogger can offer a suggestion, though: At least spell the word out!)\n\nBut there are still stragglers. Some, like conservative Henry Cuellar of Texas, equivocated even as evidence of presidential misconduct became increasingly difficult to ignore. Cuellar, who is currently locked in a primary battle with progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros, has said that he\u2019ll support proceedings \u201cif investigations prove that impeachment is the necessary course of action,\u201d the Texas Tribune reports.\n\nThe events of this month make Tlaib look prescient, and underscore the risks of the party\u2019s fearful approach to impeachment. We\u2019ve been here before: Morning Consult says that this month\u2019s poll numbers \u201cnearly match\u201d its findings in August 2018, amidst the convictions of Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen. Public opinion is malleable, but Democrats behave too often as if the opposite is true. The window is open, and they can\u2019t afford their old ambivalence.", "description": "New polls show that support for impeachment is rising, and now more Americans support impeaching Donald Trump than do not.", "authors": ["Sarah Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/26/26-trump-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
