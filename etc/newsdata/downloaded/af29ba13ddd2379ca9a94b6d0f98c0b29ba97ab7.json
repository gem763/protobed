Sacoolas was allegedly driving the car and, claiming diplomatic immunity, flew back to the US.\n\nTrump tells Harry Dunn\u2019s parents that envoy\u2019s wife will not be sent to UK Read more\n\nDunn\u2019s parents travelled to New York this week to urge Sacoolas to return and engage with a police investigation. They were surprised to receive an abrupt invitation to the White House in Washington on Tuesday \u2013 and even more taken aback by the offer that came without prior warning from Trump, a former reality TV host.\n\n\u201cThe bombshell was dropped soon after we walked in the room: Anne Sacoolas was in the building and was willing to meet with us,\u201d Charles told reporters after the meeting, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes. \u201cWe made it very clear that, as we\u2019ve said all along, we will meet with her and we would still love to meet with her but it has to be on our terms and on UK soil.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cWe were a bit shocked but it didn\u2019t really make any difference to us, to be perfectly honest. She could have been two miles away; it\u2019s just she was in the room next door. Our grief\u2019s been locked in for several weeks. It\u2019s not appropriate to meet her without therapists and mediators for us as a family but also for her. How can it be comfortable for her to be thrown into a situation like that without therapists and mediators?\u201d\n\nAsked if they regarded the plan as a \u201cstunt\u201d, Dunn hesitated before replying: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I would think maybe they were trying to force it on to us but I still think the president was sincere at the end when he spoke to Charlotte.\u201d\n\nAt first, Trump also flatly ruled out any possibility of Sacoolas returning to the UK, without giving a reason, but he signalled a possible shift later in the conversation. Dunn\u2019s parents also praised his warm and compassionate manner, noting that he held Charles\u2019s hand.\n\nSpeaking outside the White House, Charles recalled: \u201cWhen we first got there, he extended his condolences to us, which did feel sincere. I don\u2019t suppose we would have expected anything else. Many of his staff also did the same on the way in.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles speak during a interview in Manhattan on Tuesday.

Maybe we\u2019ll try and push this from a different angle.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s that tiny little bit of hope that he will take another look and maybe work harder for us.\u201d\n\nThe episode has provoked an outcry in the UK but received less attention in the US, where Trump is facing impeachment and multiple other distractions.\n\nBoris Johnson has said Sacoolas should return to Britain, insisting: \u201cI do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose.\u201d But a photograph of briefing notes held by Trump at recent event indicated that \u201cthe spouse of the US government employee will not return to the United Kingdom\u201d.\n\nAsked if she felt the parents had made progress since arriving in America, Charles said: \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve got a little bit of progress. We didn\u2019t get the answers that we wanted. They couldn\u2019t tell us who made the decision to let her come back to the US. We asked how long she was there for; they still state it was three weeks; we\u2019re not totally sure about that. And I think paperwork needs to be shown to prove that somehow.\u201d\n\nBut she said her son would have been \u201cproud\u201d of his parents taking his case all the way to the White House and meeting the US president. \u201cHe was always one to stand up for his rights when he knew he was in the right,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe would do everything that he could possibly do to make sure that he had that heard, anyone that he felt was being served any injustice ... he would have their back. He would be really proud and he\u2019s riding the skies up there now and pushing us on to continue to do him proud and more than anything now do his twin brother proud and his siblings.\u201d\n\nCharles and Dunn will remain in the US for a few days and still have questions for the UK\u2019s foreign office, including what date Sacoolas returned to the US and who made that decision. Charles said: \u201cWe still want justice for Harry and we will take it as far as we possibly can to ensure that that\u2019s done. We do feel at this stage I think that we\u2019ve pretty much done as much as we can at the moment.\u201d\n\nA statement previously released on Sacoolas\u2019s behalf said she spoke with authorities at the scene of the accident and again the following day and would continue to cooperate with them. It said: \u201cAnne is devastated by this tragic accident. No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\u201d", "description": "Charlotte Charles says president dropped \u2018bombshell\u2019 as grieving parents visited White House", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7636de4a7f92973965f780869ab51a653ce0f6c/0_0_5010_3007/master/5010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22cf51bc1df9f4ca6bde9b442c429cb5", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
