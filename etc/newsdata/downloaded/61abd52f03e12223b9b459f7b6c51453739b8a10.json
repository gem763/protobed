He was a warmonger, a Dr. Strangelove figure, metaphorically sitting astride megabombs as they hurtled toward hapless countries around the world, his riotous mustache bristling in the draft of the B-52s\u2019 flight. Back in 2005, Mr. Bolton was such a menace to peace that he couldn\u2019t get confirmed by the Senate as President George W. Bush \u2019s U.N. ambassador, driving the president to give him a recess appointment.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump made Mr. Bolton his national security adviser less than two years ago, Democrats pulled the rhetorical emergency alarm cord. \u201cWhile the president may see in Mr. Bolton a sympathetic sycophant, I would remind him that Mr. Bolton has a reckless approach to advancing the safety and security of Americans\u2014far outside any political party,\u201d said Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nNow that Mr. Trump has dropped Mr. Bolton overboard, you\u2019d think Democrats would be applauding a significant contribution to world peace. Think again. They are now declaring themselves appalled at the dangerous instability the departure of this reckless aggressor represents for the nation.\n\n\u201cJohn Bolton\u2019s sudden departure is a symbol of the disarray that has unnerved our allies since day one of the Trump Administration. Steady leadership & strategic foreign policy is key to ensuring America\u2019s national security,\u201d tweeted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nNow, to be fair, there\u2019s plenty of hypocrisy on both sides. Republicans who had welcomed Mr. Bolton\u2019s appointment as an indication that Mr. Trump was reverting to a more traditional Republican foreign policy have either been silent on Mr. Bolton\u2019s departure or have solemnly stated that the change represents a welcome turn to greater cohesion in the White House.\n\nRepublicans, in fact, have contorted themselves so completely and so eagerly in the past three years on issue after issue under Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership that it\u2019s hard to know which direction they\u2019re facing any more.\n\nIt\u2019s no use going back to yesterday. They were different people then.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth reflecting on what our political leaders\u2019 convenient cases of amnesia tell us about the dramatic way that Mr. Trump has upended American politics.\n\nIf I\u2019d told you three years ago that a Republican president would, in his first term, make serious attempts to sit down and make peace with the Taliban, Kim Jong Un and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, you\u2019d have told me I\u2019d been reading too much Lewis Carroll.\n\nAnd, of course, Mr. Trump\u2019s inversions go way beyond his unexpectedly dovish foreign-policy demarches. He has turned the Republican Party through 180 degrees on immigration, trade, entitlements and a host of other central questions.\n\nHe\u2019s done so while enjoying more support among Republican voters than any other president in recent history. The question is whether this is simply an extreme case of leadership at work\u2014what the left likes to call the Strong Man approach, in which politicians and party followers will simply get in line behind their leader, whatever he says\u2014or whether something more substantial is changing in the political landscape.\n\nIn other words, will Trumpism survive Trump?\n\nSome Republicans hope that when\u2014if?\u2014Mr. Trump departs the stage, the party will revert to \u201cnormal\u201d conservative politics. That seems implausible. The president is both cause and effect of a profound transformation in the terms of politics\u2014a shift that goes beyond America\u2019s own political debates.\n\nIn \u201cAmerican Carnage,\u201d his fascinating and exhaustive account of the path of the Republican Party in the past decade, Tim Alberta of Politico explains how the party\u2019s leadership got so out of touch with its voters at the end of George W. Bush\u2019s administration and in the early years of Barack Obama\u2019s. President Bush spotted the changes before most in his own party, Mr. Alberta writes. Early in his second term, Mr. Bush told his advisers of his concern about three broad trends developing in the nation\u2019s politics: protectionism, isolationism and nativism. \u201cThese isms are gonna eat us alive,\u201d Mr. Bush said.\n\nA decade later, Mr. Trump\u2019s political genius lay in harnessing and leveraging those isms into an electorally potent populism\u2014a political transposition that has taken our assumptions, our ideas and many of our leaders and institutions through the looking glass.", "description": "The Republican Party isn\u2019t likely to revert to the \u201cnormal\u201d conservative stances of the past once he departs the scene.", "authors": ["Gerard Baker", "Gerard.Baker Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EY786_BAKER_SOC_20190912153418.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
