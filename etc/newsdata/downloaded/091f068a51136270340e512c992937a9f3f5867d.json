The cause of damage? Peeing excessively inside the property Epstein rented for spring training in 2015.\n\nYes, you read that right, Epstein's dog peed so much he's being sued.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed this Tuesday in Maricopa County, according to the Phoenix New Times, citing Epstein's dog left \"a terrible odor and urine-stained carpeting\" in the Paradise Valley, Ariz., home where he and his family stayed.\n\nWinston is a rescue mutt, weighing in at around ten pounds. He can't pee that much, right?\n\nThe lawsuit states the dog \"peed prolifically in the $1 million house, staining tile and stone flooring, wood door jams, cabinets, and furniture.\"\n\nJohn and Mary Valentino referenced a 2017 quote by Epstein as proof that Winston had a peeing problem. When asked about being named the world's greatest leader by Fortune magazine after the Cubs 2016 World Series win, Epstein said: \"I can't even get my dog to stop peeing in the house.\"\n\nEpstein left the rental property two weeks early due to a scorpion infestation later was shown a repair estimate of $51,405, according to the report.\n\nJulian Green, the Cubs vice president of communications, told the New Times the lawsuit was \"baseless.\" He also said that an exterminator discovered 45 scorpions on the property that \"put (Epstein's) family at risk every time they put their children to sleep.\" The Epsteins moved into a different house for the last two weeks of spring training.\n\nThe owners kept the $5,000 security deposit, and according to a source the Epsteins did not hear from them again for more than four years until the suit was filed Tuesday.\n\nWhen asked about the lawsuit, Epstein replied, \"As I said, we have no untouchables. Winston is definitely available in the right trade.\"\n\nWe'll be keeping tabs on this story as it unfolds. In the meantime, it's good to see Epstein still has a sense of humor, even with a dog urine lawsuit and a Cubs managerial search on the line.", "description": "An Arizona couple claim Theo Epstein's dog irrepairably damanged their rental property, but there may have been bigger problem with the property to begin with.", "authors": ["Kelly Twardziak"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wcktae0Xst5tHoXYquHtFQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnchicago.com/af30bef7ed211e561626dd329baf2d14", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
