So I always had a political view, and the civil rights movement, of course, was electrifying.\u201d\n\nThe Detroit Democrat was consistently a progressive voice and would always, for better or worse, be identified with progressive causes. Frequently, he was a thorn in the side of Republican presidents. In 1971, he was listed as one of 20 names in an enemies list drawn up by the Nixon White House, alongside such notables as the actor Paul Newman and journalist Daniel Schorr. (A year later, he introduced a resolution calling for Nixon to be removed from office for his handling of the Vietnam War.)\n\nBut he also attacked fellow Democrats at times, once calling President Jimmy Carter \u201chopeless\u201d and \u201cdemented.\u201d In 2010, Conyers faced blowback from President Barack Obama, who didn\u2019t appreciate his policy criticism. At least some members of the Black Caucus sided with Conyers.\n\n\u201cConyers has been in Congress longer than Barack Obama could spell,\u201d said one strategist. \u201cIf he\u2019s making a complaint, it\u2019s a shot across the bow, and you might want to pay attention to that.\u201d\n\nThrough his career, he fervently supported such liberal causes as gun control, anti-poverty programs and universal health care. He held hearings to spotlight police misconduct and also supported legislation urging a study of the possibility of offering reparations to the descendants of slaves.\n\n\u201cOver 4 million Africans and their descendants were enslaved in the United States and its colonies from 1619 to 1865, and as a result, the United States was able to begin its grand place as the most prosperous country in the free world,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a 2013 interview, he explained how his service in the Korean War had led him to be a strong foe of most of America\u2019s military conflicts. \"I'm sure these are views that many will disagree with, but many of these wars were unnecessary,\" Conyers said.\n\nDays after the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Conyers introduced a resolution calling for a national holiday in his name. It took 15 years for that legislative battle to be won, but Conyers persisted. \u201cHe single-handledly fought for a King holiday,\u201d the Rev. Jesse Jackson tweeted Sunday. \u201cHe led the ground work. He is the reason for the #DrKing holiday.\u201c\n\nConyers easily won reelection every two years, though he did fail in two attempts to become mayor of Detroit in 1989 and 1993. He was relatively unscathed when his wife, Monica, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to commit bribery in 2009.\n\nIn 2017, reports surfaced that Conyers had settled a sexual harassment lawsuit with a staffer a few years earlier. Additional reports of misconduct allegations came out leading to pressure for Conyers to step down, which he did in December 2017.\n\n\u201cI am retiring today,\u201d he said on Dec. 5, 2017. \u201cAnd I want everyone to know how much I appreciate the support \u2014 the incredible, undiminished support I\u2019ve received across the years from my supporters, not only in my district but across the country as well.\u201d\n\nSome were greatly upset by his departure, others thought it was overdue, but there was no doubt he had made his mark on the institution of Congress.\n\n\u201cIt is an ignoble and overdue end to what has been, by any measure, a momentous public life,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Zack Stanton wrote at the time. \u201cConyers\u2019 service in Congress has spanned 10 presidencies and 52 years \u2014 he\u2019s been in the House for more than one-fifth of the entire existence of the U.S. Congress. In 1964, he went to Jim Crow Mississippi during Freedom Summer and offered legal representation to black voting-rights activists; one year later, he supported the Voting Rights Act as a member of the House of Representatives. He was the only congressman ever endorsed by Martin Luther King Jr.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["David Cohen"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d2/a7/3af53e514a9bb603cf0e777a46bf/20191027-john-conyers-speaks-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
