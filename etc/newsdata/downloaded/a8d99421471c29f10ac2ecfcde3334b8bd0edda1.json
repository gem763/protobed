As training camps get underway Trysta Krick digests, debriefs and explains all the crazy moves made with a map. Take notes and get ready. USA TODAY\n\nHouston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta on Friday admonished general manager Daryl Morey for a tweet Morey posted in support of protesters in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cListen\u2026@darylmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization. @ESPN,\u201d Fertitta tweeted.\n\nThat was in response to a now-deleted Morey tweet that read, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nPeople in Hong Kong are protesting a law that would allow extradition of fugitives who are wanted in mainland China. Violent clashes between protesters and police have led to \u201cunprecedented violence\u201d and a \u201csemi-paralyzed\u201d city, according to Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam.\n\nFertitta told ESPN he doesn\u2019t have a problem with Morey and wanted to clarify the team\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cI have the best general manager in the league,\u201d Fertitta told the sports network. \u201cEverything is fine with Daryl and me. We got a huge backlash, and I wanted to make clear that (the team) has no position. We\u2019re here to play basketball and not to offend anybody.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets have a strong connection to China because Chinese Hall of Famer Yao Ming spent his NBA career with the Rockets.\n\nMorey also retweeted a Mitt Romney tweet that was critical of President Donald Trump, and that tweet is still on Morey\u2019s feed.\n\nThe Rockets will play two preseason games against Toronto next week in Tokyo.", "description": "Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta on Friday scolded general manager Daryl Morey for a tweet Morey posted in support of protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published A.M.
