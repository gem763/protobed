Four years later, she\u2019s considering his rival.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the time that we have to go Conservative,\u201d Khoda said after attending a boisterous all-candidates debate at a community centre in Richmond Hill, Ontario, a city just north of Toronto. \u201cThe Liberals are going to lose seats.\u201d\n\nLike Ohio in the U.S., the sprawling suburbs around Toronto will likely dictate who will win the Oct. 21 election. After sweeping the diverse, immigrant-rich region four years ago, the Liberals are facing a difficult battle against Conservative Party led by Andrew Scheer in the bellwether region known for its 905 area code.\n\nWhile polls tip Trudeau to win the most seats, his party is riding neck and neck with the Conservatives in the popular vote. If the Liberals sink to a minority government, or lose the election, chances are it will be because Trudeau lost support in this key area over his handling of foreign policy issues such as Iran and China, and the soaring cost of living.\n\nKhoda came to the evening debate seeking answers from Liberal incumbent Majid Jowhari on his position of resuming ties with Iran \u2014 a country she fled 33 years ago \u2014 even though she has made her choice. The Liberals\u2019 views on Iran, and \u201cupsetting\u201d efforts dealing with the U.S. on trade, led her to switch support to Conservative candidate Costas Menegakis.\n\nOthers packing the gym suggest a close two-way battle between the Liberals and Conservatives in a riding pollsters say favours the incumbents.\n\n\u201cI think Majid Jowhari has a good chance,\u201d said Mohammad Mahmoudzadeh, 66, chairman of a local construction firm, though he no longer expects the Liberals to win a majority government.\n\nThe Richmond Hill riding has about 110,000 people with a median total household income of $73,563 (US$55,245), similar to Ontario\u2019s provincial average. Three out of every five people here are immigrants, of which 72 per cent are from Asia \u2014 led by China, Iran and Hong Kong, according to the country\u2019s statistics agency. Almost two thirds of the population view themselves as \u201cfirst generation\u201d Canadians.\n\nSurburban Issues\n\nRichmond Hill is one of 25 ridings in the 905 that includes the cities of Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan and Markham. They\u2019re family-oriented communities whose homeowners carry large mortgages, leaving little left over for spending elsewhere and often commute to Toronto for work, where lack of public transit is a perennial complaint.\n\n\u201cThis is a community that\u2019s been really hampered in its growth by the lack of a subway station,\u201d said Karen Mortfield, executive director of the Richmond Hill Board of Trade, which hosted the debate. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the Liberals captured all of Toronto\u2019s 25 ridings and all but three of the suburban districts, helping Trudeau win a majority government with 184 of the 338 seats in Parliament. But the seats often flip. In 2011, Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives captured most of the suburbs and parts of Toronto to gain a majority. The two regions together make up 50 seats, accounting for 15 per cent of the entire country.\n\n\u201cSince the early 1960s the suburban belt around Toronto has determined which party comes to power and whether it\u2019s going to be a majority or minority,\u201d Nelson Wiseman, a University of Toronto political science professor who specializes in Canadian politics, said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd in this election, the Liberals are going to sustain significant losses \u2014 they might lose half of those seats.\u201d\n\nWinning this region involves swinging votes by a couple percentage points and the Liberals are playing defence versus 2015, when Trudeau\u2019s \u201cSunny Ways\u201d mantra of hope appealed to Canadians wanting change after nearly a decade of Conservative rule, Wiseman said. He anticipates lower voter turnout this time, especially among younger Canadians, which favours the Conservatives since they tend to gain the older vote.\n\nThe Liberals have 36 per cent support compared to 35 per cent for the Conservatives, while the New Democratic Party is third with 13 per cent, according to a Nanos Research survey published Wednesday by CTV News and the Globe and Mail. Seat projections compiled by Canadian Broadcasting Corp. put Trudeau on track to win in 153 districts, short of the 170 required for a majority.\n\nAt Hillcrest Mall, one of Richmond Hill\u2019s biggest shopping centres, voters were divided. For Soroush Yousefi, 23, voting Conservative is a no-brainer even though he backed Trudeau four years earlier. Scheer\u2019s tax cuts and promises to boost the economy.\n\nPocket Book\n\n\u201cBack then, a lot of the things Trudeau promised seemed better, but since he\u2019s been in power, everything has been going downhill,\u201d said Yousefi, a sales associate, who points to the lofty cost of housing. \u201cEverything just keeps getting more and more expensive and the jobs aren\u2019t paying enough to keep up with your expenses.\u201d\n\nA few stores away, employee Emma Hamilton said she\u2019s probably voting Liberal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working 40 hours the entire summer each week just to save up for school so my biggest concern is everybody\u2019s stance toward education and I don\u2019t like the direction the Conservatives are going,\u201d Hamilton, 20, said while closing shop after a late weeknight shift. \u201cI feel like Trudeau\u2019s all talk as well, so I\u2019d like to vote NDP, but they never win.\u201d\n\nNo one at the mall or community centre took issue with Trudeau\u2019s blackface controversy, photos of him in dark make up as a younger man, released earlier in the campaign.\n\nEven Richmond Hill\u2019s mayor wouldn\u2019t predict the outcome of the federal contest in his backyard during an Oct. 2 phone interview.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be very close and it might end up being a party where the two governments have to work together,\u201d Mayor Dave Barrow said.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "The sprawling suburbs around Toronto the Liberals swept in 2015 are turning to the Conservatives as the cost of living soars", "authors": ["Doug Alexander", "Natalie Wong", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trudeau-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
