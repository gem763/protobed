We would like to express our sadness that events escalated this way. We are aware that one of our activists responded in self-defence in a moment of panic when confronted by a threatening situation.\n\n\"He acknowledges his accountability for this action and we offer gratitude for members of the public who helped to protect him.\"\n\nThe group apologised for the disruption caused to commuters, but said the incident should not create \"unnecessary division\".\n\nExtinction Rebellion was also denied an urgent High Court hearing of its case against London's Metropolitan Police over a capital-wide protest ban.\n\nThe force imposed a blanket ban across the city, which makes any assembly of more than two people linked to Extinction Rebellion's Autumn Uprising action illegal.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
