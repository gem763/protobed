The negative contribution from trade reflected a faster increase in imports than exports.\n\n(Reporting by Michel Rose Editing by Shri Navaratnam)", "description": "French economic growth defied expectations for a modest slowdown in the third quarter, expanding instead at the same 0.3 percent pace from the previous quarter, the INSEE national statistics office said on Wednesday.
