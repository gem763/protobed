He denies it. October 2018 - 2 counts; forcible touching and sexual abuse The grand jury indictment is connected to a different incident, in October last year at Tao nightclub in Manhattan. For that incident, he is charged with forcible touching and third degree sexual abuse. Papers filed by prosecutors on Tuesday also describe 12 other incidents over which he has not been charged but which prosecutors think constitute misconduct. They include: 1) A 2001 incident at the W Hotel where he approached a woman he had never met and 'rubbed his groin and pelvis against her buttocks while simultaneously grabbed her buttocks and breast with his hand'. 2) A 2003 incident at the Yard House in Long Beach where he allegedly put his hand on another woman's buttocks and 'squeezed it' while they had a photo taken together. He then told her: 'You've got a good piece of a**' 3) A 2006 incident at Chi, a bar in Hollywood, where he approached a woman from behind and 'bit her shoulder, on her bare back' twice, then 'thrust his pelvis' against her leg and 'attempted to lift the bottom of her shirt up' 4) A 2007 incident at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas where, at a 'movie related event', 'forcibly pulled' a woman towards him and 'attempted to kiss her' after calling her and her friends over to his table. He then allegedly 'licked' her face and 'grabbed her buttocks' The next night, he allegedly grabbed the same woman and placed his tongue against her closed lips 5) An incident at Butter, a now closed nightclub in Manhattan, sometime between 2007 and 2008 where he allegedly grabbed another woman's buttocks and 'squeezed' it as she walked through a crowd 6) An incident in 2011 at a bar in Los Angeles where he allegedly placed his hand inside a woman's blouse and 'squeezed her bare breast' and told her: 'sit on my face and pee in my mouth' 7) An October 2011 incident at Sfuzzi's in Dallas, Texas, where he allegedly grabbed a woman's buttocks and 'rubbed' them 8) A November 2013 incident at the Chatwal Hotel in New York where he 'grabbed a woman's buttocks and licked her neck' 9) A 2014 incident at Cafe Havana in Malibu where he 'reached under a woman's skirt and touched her vagina over her underwear' 10) A 2015 incident at Nobu, Malibu, where he 'attempted to kiss' a woman then bit her shoulder. When she argued with him, he allegedly called her a 'c**t' and a 'b***h'. 11) An incident 'approximately five years ago' at Burt's Tiki Lounge in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he 'grabbed a woman's buttocks' then told her to stop smoking cigarettes. 12) On August 16, 2018, at the Shore Bar in Santa Monica, told a woman: 'Damn, you're hot', asked if she was married then asked her to lean in closer to him where her proceeded to 'grab her buttocks and breast and forcibly kissed her, inserting his tongue into her mouth'\n\nShe claims Gooding stormed out in a huff and said, \"You don't have to worry, because I am never coming back here again.\" In docs, Natasha says there are surveillance videos -- from 2 angles -- that capture the alleged butt grab.\n\nShe says that he not only groped her but argued with her afterwards when she confronted him about it.\n\nThe actor's attorney, Mark Heller, said the video tape would prove the opposite.\n\nHe said the fact that she had filed a lawsuit proved she was only looking for money from the star.\n\nGooding Jr., shown in a recent social media image, denies the allegations\n\nHeller described it as 'a welcomed confirmation of the money grab that clearly was the motivation for the accuser\u2019s accusations.'\n\n'A review of the video which recorded the entire encounter does NOT support the accuser\u2019s accusations and we hope that the DA will release the video to TMZ, so that the world can see how inappropriate these accusations are and how shocking it is that the DA\u2019s office is pressing another false claim against Cuba,' he said.\n\nHer allegations are among multiple described by prosecutors earlier this month.\n\nIn total, Gooding Jr. has been charged with four misdemeanors over two incidents involving two women.\n\nAshworth's is one and the other allegedly took place at the Magic Hour Rooftop bar in New York City in June.\n\nThe accuser in that cause claims he groped her breast. He says she is lying because he rejected her.\n\nHowever prosecutors claim to have testimony from 12 other women who say that he either groped them or sexually harassed them. He has not been criminally charged over those allegations but prosecutors say it proves a pattern of behavior.\n\nHe will return to court in December.\n\n", "description": "Natasha Ashworth has filed a lawsuit against the actor seeking damages.\nShe claims he groped her behind while she was working at Tao, a trendy downtown Manhattan restaurant last year.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/21/20007772-0-image-a-114_1571690996906.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
