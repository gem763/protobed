Nonetheless, he added, the vast majority of North Koreans \u201care now engaged in such market activity for their survival.\u201d\n\nIronically, he said, the government\u2019s failure to regulate nascent market activity is creating increasing inequality based on wealth, \u201cwhere only those with money have access to basic rights such as education, health care, freedom of movement and adequate housing.\u201d\n\nRead more: President Trump\u2019s Ongoing Failure With North Korea Talks\n\nQuintana said severe restrictions on basic freedoms continue to be widespread, including surveillance and close monitoring of civilians. \u201cNorth Korean people continue to live in the entrenched fear of being sent to a political prison camp,\u201d called a kwanliso, he said.\n\n\u201cIf you are considered to be a spy of the hostile countries or a traitor, when in reality you are simply exercising your basic human rights, you can be suddenly taken by agents of the Ministry of State Security to a kwanliso and never be seen again,\u201d Quintana said. \u201cSuspects\u2019 families are never informed of the decisions or of the whereabouts of their relatives.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of North Koreans who have fled to China, Quintana said in the past six months he has received information from family members living in South Korea of an increasing number of these escapees being detained in China.\n\nA worker at the Songdowon General Foodstuff Factory.
