There will be an inspection every year and if I don't fix any problems they find, I've got to go too.\n\n\"We can't on there until March 1 so it makes no sense - we can't get on there to actually fix the problem if there is one.\n\n\"There are people who have been on the site for decades who will now be removed for no good reason.\n\n\"I have spent \u00a32,500 refurbishing this caravan and for what? We have never broken any rules or caused any trouble.\"\n\nOther people with holiday homes at Kingfisher have also complained they will have to be off-site soon because of the age of their caravan.\n\nA letter obtained by Lincolnshire Live addressed to caravan owners at the park alludes to the changes made as part of a \"review\" recently carried out.\n\n\"The changes aim to bring the site in line with how most other caravan parks operate along the coast,\" it said.\n\n\"As your caravan is more than 15 years past its manufacture date, the change in policy means it would have to undergo and pass an inspection to qualify for an extension of license agreement for a further one year to stay on Kingfisher Caravan Park.\n\n\"This practice will continue until your caravan passes its 20-year point of manufacture date.\n\n\"After the 20-year point, your caravan must leave our site.\"\n\nThe letter continues: \"We would like to thank you for your custom over the time you have spent with us at Kingfisher Caravan Park and wish you well for the future.\"\n\nThe news comes as it emerged that Coastfields Leisure - which has worked as a third party agent selling caravans on the site for 14 years - will no longer operate caravan sales at Kingfisher from January after East Lindsey District Council decided not to re-tender the contract.\n\nIn a post online, Coastfields said: \"Coastfields Leisure have appreciated the opportunity to work with East Lindsey District Council over the last 14 years and to provide our customers on Kingfisher with access to our swimming pool and entertainment facilities as well as the popular road train service, all of which will be discontinued at the end of the 2019 season.\"\n\nKingfisher Caravan Park was approached for comment.", "description": "The woman and her three children have been at Kingfisher Caravan Park in Ingoldmells, Lincolnshire, for years", "authors": ["Peter Hennessy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658698.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_KINGFISHER-CARAVAN-PARK.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
