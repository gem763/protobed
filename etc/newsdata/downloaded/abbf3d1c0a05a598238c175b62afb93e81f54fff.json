REUTERS/Cate Cadell\n\n\u201cSo handsome, so handsome ... we love you, Beijing loves you,\u201d she said, holding both thumbs up to soldiers as they waved to the crowd from behind long black guns anchored to each tank.\n\nAs China\u2019s National Day military parade extravaganza wound up on Tuesday, thousands of people who were unable to see the actual parade because of tight security restrictions lined the streets behind steel barricades to watch phalanxes of tanks and armored vehicles pass on their way out of the capital.\n\nThe parade, which included some 15,000 troops, cutting-edge military hardware and a flyover by dozens of jets, is a celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist Party-ruled China and is the most important event in the country\u2019s 2019 calendar.\n\nIn Beijing - where images of events like the Tiananmen Square crackdown of 30 years ago are heavily censored, and China\u2019s wartime victories are glorified in television serials - praise for the military show seemed virtually unanimous.\n\n\u201cIn the whole world there is no other country that has a parade like this ... long live China,\u201d said Li, who came with her four-year-old daughter.\n\nOrganizers last month said 30,000 Beijing residents were selected to view the parade itself.\n\nBut citizens of all ages - many carrying flags and taking pictures and videos on their smartphones - began lining the exit routes hours in advance to catch a glimpse of the imposing hardware after the parade.\n\n\u201cI feel very thrilled,\u201d said 12-year old student Zhang Huaiqiu.\n\n\u201cI have experienced the power of Chinese military weaponry. My horizons have been greatly expanded.\u201d\n\n\u2018SO PROUD\u2019\n\nThis year\u2019s parade holds special significance for President Xi Jinping, as the country looks to bolster patriotism in the face of mounting challenges at home and abroad.\n\nWhile perceptions of China have tended towards the negative in Western countries over the past 18 months amid a trade war with the United States and other issues, the Communist Party and Xi remain widely popular in China.\n\n\u201cSupporting him is supporting China. Those who don\u2019t support him don\u2019t have patriotic feelings,\u201d said 47-year old Gang Meng, who came early to one of central Beijing\u2019s old-style hutong neighborhoods to take photos of her son in the flag-lined streets ahead of the parade.\n\nXi\u2019s popularity is linked to his flagship anti-corruption drive and a wider campaign to boost the country\u2019s technological and military prowess.\n\nFor Beijing\u2019s older residents, who remember military parades under previous leaders, Tuesday\u2019s show seemed much more polished.\n\nLiu Shuxian, a 63-year-old university library worker, remembers seeing his first military parade in 1989, the 40th anniversary of Communist China and the same year as the Tiananmen square protests.\n\n\u201cAt the time, the soldiers\u2019 outfits were not as modern as they are now, and they were very natural, they didn\u2019t give people the feeling that they were deliberately performing. It was the result of normal training.\u201d\n\nLiu, whose university-appointed housing fronts the street where the military procession made its exit, still keeps photos of the tanks that passed during the city\u2019s last military parade four years ago, marking the anniversary of the end of World War Two.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stunning, beyond imagination, and I\u2019m so proud of the motherland. It\u2019s not easy, so we must cherish it.\u201d", "description": "Amid the roar of tanks rolling through a residential street in central Beijing at midday, 31-year-old Li Meiping cried tears of joy.", "authors": ["Cate Cadell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435830030&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902F3", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
