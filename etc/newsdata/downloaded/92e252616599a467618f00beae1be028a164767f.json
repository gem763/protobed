She will get to pick those board members if two people currently on the board, Bruce Dunlevie and Steven Langman, step down.\n\nAnother possible change being considered is taking Rebekah Neumann out of this role, the FT report said.\n\nWe Company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.", "description": "WeWork owner The We Company's executives, investors and advisers are discussing curbing the voting power of founder Adam Neumann and removing his wife from a role in succession planning, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the matter.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429197025&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1ZM", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
