The trial was expected to be the first benchmark case holding pharmaceutical companies to account for allegedly contributing to the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic.\n\nAn Israel-based pharmaceutical company, Teva TEVA, -2.18%, was poised to go to trial in Ohio federal court alongside drug distributors AmerisourceBergen ABC, -0.41% Cardinal Health CAH, -1.39% and McKesson MCK, -0.30% and the pharmacy-chain Walgreens WBA, -1.56%.\n\nBut an 11th-hour settlement averted the trial.\n\nAll the companies except Walgreens reached a last-minute settlement. A Walgreens spokesperson told MarketWatch it never marketed, prescribed or made opioids.\n\nCuyahoga and Summit counties in Ohio agreed to a settlement with the companies, which were accused of recklessly prescribing and distributing drugs that contained the powerful opioid medications oxycodone and fentanyl.\n\nThe companies are not admitting any liability in the settlement. The distributors said they \u201cstrongly dispute\u201d the allegations in the now-settled trial but said a deal was an \u201cimportant stepping stone\u201d working out a broader deal to address the epidemic.\n\nAs part of the settlement agreed this week, the distributors are paying $215 million to two counties and Teva is paying $20 million in cash and supplying $25 million worth of its brand name Suboxone.\n\nThis Ohio case was to be the first federal test case of more than 2,000 lawsuits from states, counties and cities, but there have been other state-level cases.\n\nThis summer, an Oklahoma state judge ruled Johnson & Johnson contributed to the opioid crisis and subsidiaries and ordered a $572-million payment. He later scaled the judgment down to $465 million, admitting a calculation error. Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.71% is appealing the case, saying it followed all laws.\n\nWill the settlement help patients?\n\nBut considering government estimates that 130 people die daily from opioid-related overdoses and 10.3 million people misused prescription painkillers last year, how much of a difference can a steady supply of the medication make to stop the crisis?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one piece of the puzzle, but it\u2019s a welcome addition to the puzzle,\u201d said Dr. Paul Earley, president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, a medical society representing around 6,000 doctors, clinicians and other industry professionals. Many people fighting opioid addictions are homeless or \u201cterribly financially strapped\u201d and \u201chaving more access to medication that\u2019s properly prescribed is a good thing,\u201d he noted.\n\nPeople with insurance can pay between $100 and $300 every month for Suboxone, \u201ca good, life-saving drug,\u201d according to Dr. Lantie Jorandby, the chief medical officer of Lakeview Health, a Jacksonville, Fla.-based addiction treatment center.\n\nSome opioid-addiction fighting drugs cost far more, Jorandby added. Insured patients can pay upwards of $1,000 a month for Vivitrol, the brand term for Naltrexone, another medicine to fight opioid and alcohol dependence, and patients without coverage can pay up to $1,500, she said.\n\nLike Earley, Jorandby said more medicine isn\u2019t a cure-all, adding that adequate medical access, insurance coverage and effective treatment methods all have to be addressed if any court settlements are going to thwart the country\u2019s opioid epidemic.\n\n\u2018Ohio will wait and see\u2019\n\nAlso this week, Attorneys General from North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas said they reached a \u201cproposed settlement framework\u201d with Teva, AmerisourceBergen Cardinal Health, McKesson and Johnson & Johnson to settle all the cases against them.\n\nThe $48-billion proposal would include a $22-billion cash payment, as well as the supply and distribution of generic Suboxone \u2014 supplies and services valued at a total $26 billion.\n\n\u201cTeva is agreeing to provide 100% of the national demand for product over 10 years,\u201d North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein told reporters, valuing that at a $23-billion cost. \u201cIf demand is greater, then their contribution will be greater,\u201d he added. Teva would also pay $250 million in the deal.\n\nTeva\u2019s statement said it would donate the medicine \u201cin quantities of up to the amount needed to meet the majority of the currently estimated U.S. patient need over the next 10 years.\u201d\n\nIt said it was \u201cpleased to positively contribute to solving the nationwide opioid epidemic,\u201d adding, \u201cTeva has consistently committed to complying with all laws and regulations regarding its manufacture and sale of opioids. Neither settlement includes an admission of liability.\u201d\n\nBut the $48-billion proposal is not a done deal. The four Attorneys General acknowledged they needed to persuade other states, counties and cities to agree. That\u2019s not a given. For example, Ohio Attorney Dave Yost said in a statement, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a framework, it\u2019s a pile of lumber that\u2019s been dropped on the construction site. Ohio will wait and see what the detailed plan looks like.\u201d\n\nPurdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, reached a tentative settlement in September with approximately half of the more than 2,000 state and local government cases, but the company is in bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nFrom court rooms to treatment\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to burn the midnight oil to create this settlement document and put it into practice,\u201d Stein, the North Carolina Attorney General, said Monday. But real-life application of any legal deal might not be so simple. Many treatment roadblocks are about what patients can afford, not any party\u2019s legal liability.\n\n\u201cOverall, the access to buprenorphine is insufficient to curb the tide of this epidemic,\u201d said Earley, referring to Suboxone\u2019s generic name. \u201cAnything that will help access to the medication is the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nPatient demand is strong, but there\u2019s an \u201cinadequate number of prescribers,\u201d he said.\n\nDoctors, nurse practitioners and physicians assistants all need special waivers to prescribe buprenorphine to patients with opioid-use disorders, Earley noted. More than 74,000 doctors, nurse practitioners and physicians assistants have the waiver, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nThere are 480,000 primary-care physicians alone in the country, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-profit organization focused on public health and health policy. There\u2019s also \u201cinadequate access to prescribers,\u201d Earley noted. He said that happens because many patients lack the money or the awareness about the services out there, especially in rural areas.\n\nEven if patients find treatment, Gary Mendell, founder and CEO of Shatterproof, a Norwalk, Conn.-based nonprofit, said too many addiction-recovery services think people can beat their addictions by going cold turkey from all sorts medication like methadone of Suboxone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely important and life-saving that this money gets used based on science, not based on outdated belief\u201d about getting sober by abstaining, said Mendell, whose non-profit organization fights to destigmatize addiction and promote evidence-based treatment.\n\nIf doctors and treatment centers are ready, willing and able to prescribe Suboxone and other opioid-fighting medication, insurance companies might not be willing to foot the bill.\n\nJorandby said health insurers tell Lakeview patients on a weekly basis that they have to leave because the companies will not pay for the services. That means doctors have to fight for coverage and continuing treatment, she said, adding, \u201cWe are going to the mat every day.\u201d\n\nLaws over the years, including the Affordable Care Act of 2010, required insurers to cover substance abuse in the same way they cover medical and surgical benefits.\n\nBut Jorandby said many health insurers \u201cstill stigmatize\u201d substance abuse patients \u201cby not giving the full range of services.\u201d She said there\u2019s still \u201ca pervasive attitude addiction is a weakness, a moral failing. It\u2019s just kind of baked into the insurance company model.\u201d", "description": "Millions people caught up in the opioid epidemic have difficulty paying for treatments and accessing health care.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT818_opioid_ZG_20191022232404.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
