The push has since been championed by Michael Bloomberg-funded Everytown for Gun Safety, where it is presented as an effort to close the \u201cboyfriend loophole.\u201d\n\nThis effort ultimately expands the National Instant Criminal Background Check System\u2019s (NICS) prohibited purchaser\u2019s list, adding certain dinner dates or brief, former dating partners to the left\u2019s growing list of people who cannot purchases firearms.\n\nO\u2019Rourke is on board with the ban:\n\nOn average, 52 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner each month. Women\u2019s experiences of gun violence are inextricably linked to domestic abuse. That\u2019s why we must close the Boyfriend Loophole and prevent stalkers and abusers from having easy access to guns. https://t.co/RbwvTD4L14 \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) October 18, 2019\n\nThe left\u2019s efforts to use domestic monikers to prevent gun ownership by a boyfriend or dating partner is presented as a way to keep women safe. But the reality is that a woman is often at a disadvantage in an attack whether a gun is involved or not, and a woman with a gun can level the playing field (if not turn the tables altogether).\n\nThe Washington Post reported U.S. Census information showing how effective a gun can be for a woman who is under duress. It reported:\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau conducts in-person interviews with several thousand persons annually, for the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). In 1992-2002, over 2,000 of the persons interviewed disclosed they had been raped or sexually assaulted. Of them, only 26 volunteered that they used a weapon to resist. In none of those 26 cases was the rape completed; in none of the cases did the victim suffer additional injury after she deployed her weapon.\n\nOn April 4, 2017, Breitbart News reported on stalking victim Dawn Hillyer, who spoke about the terrifying 60 days she had to spend without a gun while waiting for a concealed carry permit. She described the wait for government permission to carry a gun for self-defense as \u201cunacceptable\u201d and noted that the experience taught her the important role a gun plays in delivering piece of mind and the ability to protect one\u2019s self.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
