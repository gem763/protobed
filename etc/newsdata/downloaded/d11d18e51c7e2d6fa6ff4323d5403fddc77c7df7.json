I totally understand that.\n\n'On the dance-off you have to trust the judge's opinion and Catherine was completely humble and gracious. We've been messaging each other with messages of support. It' nothing personal like that.\n\nCatherine Tyldesley (pictured) lost the dance-off and people accused the show of rigged results following her departure\n\n'But to have people saying 'unless you pull out they're boycotting the show or they're going to kill you' it just seemed so far and above as to be ridiculous when there are so many important issues in the world.\n\n'This is an entertainment show. It's not rigged, the judges are the best in the world, they know what they're talking about and it was on that one dance off.'\n\nMike added that listening to criticism from judges Craig Revel Horwood and Bruno Tonioli about his bottom sticking out helped him win the dance-off.\n\nHe said: 'With the dance-off you think this is your last chance, your last chance saloon.\n\nMike (pictured with his dance partner, Katya) was sat on the sofa with his wife when he was horrified to receive a death threat\n\n'The dance-off is a funny thing - it is like a penalty shoot out and so I put everything into it.\n\n'I listened to what Craig said, I listened to what Bruno said about my bottom sticking out and tried to tuck it in and Katya said the dance-off was 50 time better than the main dance on Saturday night.\n\n'We then turned to each other and said we can't do any more and it was quite a big relief.\n\n'You can't lose in that situation. If you go out you go out with your head held high. If you survive another week then you go through and you're very grateful for that. it's awful sending someone home that's the only thing.\n\n'I definitely feel I upped my game on the dance-off and Catherine did as well. I couldn't call it, I'm not a technical expert at all.\n\n'I think overall in the series Catherine is the better dancer and her and J are wonderful people, a wonderful pairing and I thought they might go all the way to the final but on the night what happens happens and one has to go home and if it's on the dance off it can be tough and it's like penalty shoot out.\n\nViewers had expected Catherine (pictured on the show on Sunday) to win the dance-off against the BBC sports presenter\n\n'How many times have we seen bigger teams lose like when Spurs this season to Colchester in a penalty shoot out. Sometimes these things can happen.\n\n'All you can do is worry about yourself and worry about doing your best and if you've done your best that's all you can do and hen it's in the hands of the judges.\n\n'All I can do is put the hours in and try my best and if that's good enough to get you through - fantastic. If not as long as you go home with your head held high then that's absolutely fine.'\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Solent this morning, the station where he got his first broadcasting job, Mike said: 'The judges are like the referee, accept the decision and get on with it.\n\n'To have that sort of abuse thrown at me, that's crazy. It's got way out of hand. Yesterday I got loads of messages of support so that was the flip side of things so that was nice. You can't get too worked up about it, you have to rise above it.'", "description": "BBC sports presenter Mike, 53, told of his horror as he spoke for the first time about the threat to his life on Twitter by a deranged viewer as some suggested the results were rigged.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/20325660-0-image-a-17_1572354196003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
