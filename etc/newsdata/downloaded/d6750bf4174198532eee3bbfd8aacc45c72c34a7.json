Johnson\u2019s Brexit Secretary, Stephen Barclay, got a warm welcome from EU negotiator Michel Barnier before they started almost two hours of talks around breakfast.\n\n\u201cIf there is a will, there is, of course, a way. Otherwise people would not be working on this,\u201d said EU Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva.\n\nOriginally, Tusk said he was planning to pull the plug Friday on the Brexit talks, but because of the breakthrough he can now see talks going through the weekend, ahead of the EU\u2019s two-day summit, which starts next Thursday.\n\nTusk said \u201cthere is no guarantee of success and the time is practically up\u201d but insisted both sides should use every opportunity available ahead of Britain\u2019s scheduled Oct. 31 departure date.\n\n\u201cA no-deal Brexit will never be the choice of the EU,\u201d Tusk said.\n\nJohnson said late Thursday there was a \u201cpathway\u201d to a belated agreement to stave off a chaotic, costly no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31, while Varadkar said the meeting was \u201cvery positive.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting with Barclay, Barnier said it was essential to keep focus.\n\n\u201cBrexit is like climbing a mountain. We need vigilance, determination and patience,\u201d said the man who once organized the 1992 Winter Olympics in his Savoie region of France.\n\nThe main stumbling block remains how to handle the U.K.\u2019s only land border with the EU, which is on the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nThe challenge of keeping this border invisible \u2014 something that has underpinned both the local economy and the region\u2019s peace deal \u2014 has dominated Brexit discussions for three years, ever since U.K. voters chose in 2016 to leave the EU.\n\nTusk insisted \u201ceven the slightest chance must be used\u201d to avoid an acrimonious split since both the EU and the U.K. would be hit hard economically.\n\nOne way to do that could be to extend the Oct. 31 deadline so that negotiators have more time to work things out in legally-binding detail. But Johnson has insisted that Britain is leaving on Oct. 31 \u201cdo or die\u201d \u2014 with or without a divorce deal.\n\nFrance has also long said that deadlines cannot be extended forever, since Britain was originally slated to leave the bloc on March 31.\n\nIn Paris, France\u2019s European affairs minister, Amelie de Montchalin, had another take on the debate, saying that a no-deal Brexit \u201cis probable, at this stage.\u201d\n\nDe Montchalin told France Inter radio that she does not see an obvious reason to grant a further extension to the U.K.\n\n\u201cI have a fundamental question: why give more time. If it is time for the sake of time? It has taken one year, even three years, and we don\u2019t really get it,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nMenelaos Hadjicostis contributed from Nicosia.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 The European Union said Friday that talks with the U.K. to find an amicable divorce deal were back on track, despite huge challenges and a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/11/5663f3_aptopix-belgium-eu-brexit-20591-european-union-chief-brexit-negotiator-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
