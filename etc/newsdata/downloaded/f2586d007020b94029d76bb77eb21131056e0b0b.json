This is true: The vegetable\u2019s exact future remains unknown, and using search and sales data to triangulate people\u2019s true feelings is certainly an imprecise science. Many people do, of course, genuinely like kale. But the most revealing thing about America\u2019s relationship with kale isn\u2019t whether people are buying the vegetable, but when.\n\nDuring the holidays, people make dishes they love and want to share, so it makes sense that fewer Americans would be searching for brussels-sprouts cooking times as soon as a big food-prep holiday is over. January, however, is not really part of the holidays. Rather than piles of delicious food, the month traditionally brings promises of long-term self-abnegation; it\u2019s when America\u2019s sense of duty toward \u201chealthy\u201d things shines. But like almost all New Year\u2019s resolutions, America\u2019s commitment to eat more kale rarely makes it to February. If eating kale were something that people mostly enjoyed, you\u2019d think they\u2019d keep right on stuffing it down their gullets in blissful perpetuity.\n\nRead: It\u2019s the most inadequate time of the year\n\nIt might be that Americans try to love kale every January for the same reason the green so quickly became a household name in the first place. In the era of \u201cclean eating\u201d and internet wellness fads, kale comes approved by internet wellness gurus. It has been branded a \u201csuperfood,\u201d and it\u2019s talked about in juice shops with such hushed reverence that you\u2019d think it held the key to eternal life. It\u2019s low calorie and nutrient dense, with particularly robust supplies of vitamins A, C, and K, plus some fiber and protein. But avoiding kale won\u2019t hurt you. Pretty much all dark, leafy greens have strong nutrient profiles, so there\u2019s little reason to privilege one over all the others.\n\nMarketers seem to have quickly caught on that many Americans might want to consume kale without being forced to taste, chew, and swallow a significant amount of it. A 2017 analysis from Nielsen identified eight areas in which sales of products containing the vegetable had grown significantly in the previous year, and many of them\u2014snacks, pasta sauces, and deli dips, for example\u2014are prepared foods in which kale\u2019s characteristics can be masked. Sales of vitamins and supplements with kale in them also more than doubled, even though desiccated kale powder is basically devoid of the nutrients that make the full plant good for you. The most explosive growth for kale products happened in baby foods, the sales of which nearly quadrupled. The Americans eating kale most consistently, in other words, might be those who literally have things spoon-fed to them, with no say in the matter.\n\nPuzzling together the available data creates a picture of a populace with an uneasy relationship with a vegetable whose health reputation is so powerful that people seem to think of it like taking a vitamin. Or maybe the more accurate analogy for eating kale would be flossing\u2014something Americans know is supposed to be good for them, but that\u2019s still annoying and unpleasant. Food trends usually last 10 to 20 years before waning, but if the things people search for and buy are any indication, many Americans seem eager to make it to kale\u2019s cultural finish line. If Beyonc\u00e9 dancing pantsless in a sweatshirt emblazoned with the word kale can\u2019t persuade the country to get over its aversion to the vegetable, it might be time everyone admitted their true feelings and just went back to spinach.", "description": "America never really liked kale.", "authors": ["Amanda Mull"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_150530594/facebook.jpg?1569620197", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
