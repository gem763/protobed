If one is ethically comfortable with giving a bribe, it begs to question whether the same individual would find it ethically permissible to accept a bribe?\n\n\"This becomes worrying when it becomes evident that the individual at the cornerstone of such claims is in charge of South Africa\u2019s nuclear plans, mineral resources and energy. Furthermore, both the minister and the implicated journalists may have contravened Section 3 of the Prevention and Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act,\" Mileham said.\n\nThe party said it welcomed the newspaper's investigation into the matter and hoped that it holds the implicated journalists to account.\n\nThe DA called for strong action to be taken against the journalists.\n\n\"Equally, we hope that Parliament\u2019s Ethics Committee will investigate the case against Mantashe with the urgency and gravity it deserves. Brown envelope journalism should be frowned upon and those who indulge in such transactions must be held accountable for their actions.\n\n\"It is unacceptable for a member of Cabinet to bribe the media, or individual journalists, regardless of the story or occasion. South Africans deserve a free and fair media, which provides unbiased content free from bribes and corruption,\" Mileham said.\n\nAttempt to get comment from the Presidency by News24 were unsuccessful.\n\nMeanwhile, IOL reported that presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko had referred all questions to Mantashe's office.", "description": "The DA has asked Parliament\u2019s Joint Committee on Ethics and Members\u2019 Interests to look into Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe's conduct, following claims that he bribed two journalists.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6867/8cec3710a12b448e97fedc3882b48b40.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
