Pinch runner Billy Hamilton scored and Rafael Ortega advanced to third as Duvall stepped up to the plate.\n\nDuvall, who entered the game as a pinch hitter in the eighth inning, then blasted a liner into center field to put the Braves ahead 3-1. It marked the second big hit of the series for the slugger after he smashed a pinch-hit home run in Atlanta\u2019s 3-0 win Friday.\n\nThe Cardinals grabbed an early 1-0 lead in the second after Matt Carpenter scored Marcell Ozuna on a sacrifice fly. St. Louis ultimately managed only four hits and wasted a solid performance by Wainwright, who pitched 7 2/3 innings in his first postseason start since 2014.\n\nWainwright, 38, allowed only four hits, struck out eight and walked two.\n\nBraves starter Mike Soroka gave up one earned run and two hits across seven innings. He recorded seven strikeouts and walked none.\n\nGame 4 of the best-of-five series is scheduled for Monday at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. The Braves need one more victory to reach the NL Championship Series for the first time since 2001.", "description": "Oct. 6 (UPI) \u2014 Dansby Swanson tied the game with two outs in the ninth inning and Adam Duvall belted a two-run single as the Atlanta Braves rallied", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
