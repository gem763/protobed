REUTERS/Nir Elias/File Photo\n\nOpinion polls predict a close race when Israel goes to the polls on Tuesday, five months after an inconclusive election in which Netanyahu declared himself the winner but failed to put together a coalition government.\n\n\u201cA Likud victory is possible but it\u2019s hanging by a thread,\u201d said Abraham Diskin, political science professor at Jerusalem\u2019s Hebrew University, referring to Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing party.\n\nAn end to the Netanyahu era after his 10 successive years in power would be unlikely to lead to a dramatic change in Israel\u2019s policy on hotly disputed issues in a peace process with the Palestinians that collapsed five years ago.\n\nRelations with the United States would be likely to remain on track, despite Netanyahu\u2019s close relationship with President Donald Trump.\n\nLikud is running neck-and-neck with the centrist Blue and White party led by former armed forces chief Benny Gantz, who has focused heavily on looming corruption charges Netanyahu faces.\n\nBut Netanyahu\u2019s political fate could ultimately end up in the hands of the far-right Yisrael Beitenu headed by former Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, a potential kingmaker in the coalition-building certain to follow the vote.\n\nAfter the election in April, Lieberman blocked Netanyahu\u2019s attempts to form a coalition, citing differences with the prime minister\u2019s ultra-Orthodox allies. Opinion polls indicate Yisrael Beitenu will emerge stronger in the new ballot.\n\nANNEXATION\n\nNetanyahu has campaigned hard to avoid losing power, as he did in 1999 against then-Labour party leader Ehud Barak, appearing in hours of live video question-and-answer sessions on Facebook in recent weeks and dominating the news in Israel.\n\nIn a step this week that alarmed Palestinian and other Arab leaders but delighted his core right-wing constituency, Netanyahu announced his intention to annex the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank.\n\nIt was, Israeli political commentators said, a clear attempt to draw votes away from far-right parties.\n\nNetanyahu hammered home a get-out-the-vote message: Applying Israeli sovereignty to the valley, which Palestinians want as part of a future state, will happen only if Likud emerges from the election as the biggest party in the Knesset (parliament).\n\nIn Israel, votes are cast for a party\u2019s list of Knesset candidates. Since no party has ever won a majority of seats on its own, Israel has always been ruled by coalitions, making post-election political bargaining key to determining the ultimate winner.\n\nNetanyahu has burnished a statesman\u2019s image during the campaign, visiting Britain last week for talks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and meeting President Vladimir Putin in Russia on Thursday.\n\nRelated Coverage Factbox - Where Netanyahu stands on key Israeli policy issues\n\nNetanyahu has also showcased his relationship with Trump, featuring posters in which both are shaking hands. But there has been no sign from Trump of a \u201cgrand gesture\u201d that could bolster Netanyahu as a candidate.\n\nShortly before the last election, with the prime minister at his side, Trump signed a proclamation recognising Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Israel captured the strategic area in a 1967 war and annexed it in 1981, moves not accepted by most world powers, who deem it to be occupied Syrian territory.\n\n\u201cNATIONAL UNITY\u201d\n\nThe line-up of challengers this time is similar to the one Netanyahu faced in the previous election, with Blue and White his biggest threat.\n\nBlue and White has said it would \u201cstrengthen the settlement blocs\u201d in the West Bank, with the Jordan Valley as Israel\u2019s \u201ceastern security border\u201d. But that falls short of an outright commitment to annex the valley, and a party spokesman said a Blue and White-led government would \u201cmaintain an open channel\u201d for a peace deal with the Palestinians.\n\nMost of the international community regards the Israeli settlements as illegal, a view that Israel disputes.\n\nThe spokesman said the party would seek \u201cthe return of bipartisanship to Israel-U.S. relations\u201d, a reference to Netanyahu\u2019s close ties with Trump and his Republican party and sharp differences with the Democrats over issues such as Iran\u2019s nuclear programme and Middle East peacemaking.\n\nAfter an election in Israel, its president gauges, following consultations with all political parties that won parliamentary seats, which legislator stands the best chance of forming a government.\n\nBoth Netanyahu and Gantz hope to be tapped, but a photo finish would complicate the picture.\n\nA \u201cnational unity\u201d government could avoid or resolve a stalemate if a Likud-led right-wing coalition or a Blue and White-led centre-left alliance prove impossible.\n\nGantz has said his party would not join a government with Netanyahu in it, citing the prime minister\u2019s legal troubles.\n\nIf a partnership with Gantz is the only way to stay out of the back benches, prominent Likud members could try to topple Netanyahu as party leader, some political analysts have said.\n\nBlue and White tied with Likud on 35 seats in the April election, and Gantz is seen by some voters as \u201cMr Clean\u201d.\n\n\u201cHis low-key style and relative ineloquence are for many a modest man\u2019s refreshing antithesis to Bibi\u2019s perceived bluster and soloism. Gantz is seen as balanced, cautious and pragmatic,\u201d said Amotz Asa-El, a research fellow at Jerusalem\u2019s Shalom Hartman Institute.\n\nTwo weeks after the election, Israel\u2019s attorney-general will hold a pre-trial hearing in which Netanyahu can argue against his announced intention to file fraud and bribery charges against him in the corruption investigations.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nNetanyahu, who has denied any wrongdoing, has said he will not quit as prime minister if indicted, and there is no legal obligation to do so. Allies have said they will press parliament to grant Netanyahu, as a member of the body, immunity from prosecution.\n\nAfter election night, it could all come down to Yisrael Beitenu\u2019s Lieberman, at odds with Netanyahu\u2019s traditional ultra-Orthodox partners over military conscription exemptions for Jewish seminary students.\n\nLieberman, whose party is projected to double its April Knesset seat tally to 10, has said Yisrael Beitenu will not join up with a Netanyahu administration after Tuesday\u2019s vote if it includes the religious factions.", "description": "Twenty years after Benjamin Netanyahu's first term as Israel's prime minister ended, the man hailed by supporters as \"King Bibi\" is again fighting for his political survival in a rerun election.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429476033&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1MC", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
