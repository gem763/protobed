Please disengage from the violent groups and let police intervene,\" Paris police said on Twitter, adding that its intervention would involve the use of tear gas.\n\nAccording to AFP, police also used controversial non-lethal weapons known as lanceurs de balles de d\u00e9fense \u2014 or, more commonly, LBDs \u2014 which have drawn strong criticism from human rights groups.\n\n\"Brutalities (not by climate activists) occurred at the front of the procession.

The demonstrations, led by youth activists, are set to continue for a week and come ahead of Monday's U.N. climate summit in New York.", "description": "Some 7,500 police were mobilized in anticipation of marches in French capital.", "authors": ["Simon Van Dorpe", "Paola Tamma", "John Lichfield"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1169972475-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
