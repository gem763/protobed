Simmering tensions between drivers and ride-hailing companies are flaring again, as drivers in major cities across the U.S. and the U.K. went on strike Wednesday over low wages and unstable working conditions. Photographer: Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg (Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg)\n\nUber and Lyft drivers have long complained about their wages and contractor status. Now it\u2019s the latest issue highlighting a growing split between the Democratic Party\u2019s establishment and the more progressive left.\n\nAt issue is California bill AB5, which could convert hundreds of thousands of contract workers in the state to employee status, instituting wage floors and ushering in benefits. The bill has drawn widespread support among advocacy groups and progressive politicians \u2014 and detraction from the app-based companies themselves and their political backers.\n\nThe state Senate approved the bill in Sacramento late Tuesday night, sending it back to the state Assembly before needing the governor\u2019s signature.\n\nThe bill has proven particularly divisive for members nationwide of the Democratic Party. That\u2019s in part because it has pitted Obama-era officials who have joined the companies in advisory roles against newer progressives who see a mandate to address economic inequality head-on and advocate for gig workers.\n\n[Uber and Lyft are floating a $21 minimum wage. Critics say it\u2019s closer to $15.]\n\nThe tension between the two party wings came to a head late last month when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) scolded former Calif. Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, who now serves as a Lyft adviser, for penning an opinion piece in the San Francisco Chronicle criticizing some tenets of AB5.\n\nFormer \u201cofficials should not become corporate lobbyists, in letter or spirit. It\u2019s an abuse of power + a stain on public service,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to fight FOR working people, not against them.\u201d\n\nFmr officials should not become corporate lobbyists, in letter or spirit. It\u2019s an abuse of power + a stain on public service.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a Democrat doing it (both parties do). In fact, that makes it worse - we\u2019re supposed to fight FOR working people, not against them. https://t.co/r6DN9mwf3A \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 29, 2019\n\nThe struggle has illuminated a deepening divide within the Democratic Party over establishment pro-corporate sensibilities, which progressives say has come at the expense of workers who have suffered under the gig economy. The party has become fiercely critical of the Clinton and Obama era defections to Big Tech and Wall Street, a sentiment most vocally expressed by presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and newly elected congresswomen forming a cadre known as \u201cthe Squad.\u201d\n\nAs recently as this week, the candidate who most represents what political observers see as the establishment wing of the party \u2014 Former vice president Joe Biden \u2014 had declined to take a stance on AB5 after multiple inquiries by The Washington Post. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who has long been regarded as a business friendly pragmatist, surprised some including executives at Uber and Lyft, by forcefully backing employment for ride-share drivers.\n\n[Internal data shows Uber\u2019s reputation hasn\u2019t changed much since #DeleteUber]\n\nMeanwhile, Uber, Lyft and their drivers are caught in the middle. The companies are against the employee designation, which could lead them to shoulder substantial costs not previously mandated. Drivers, on the other hand, are divided because of a rift between old workers who want better benefits, protections and wages and newer workers, some of whom have told the companies they want to maintain the flexibility accompanies contractor status.\n\nUber and Lyft are pushing for an alternative to AB5, and together with Doordash say they will spend a combined $90 million on a 2020 ballot initiative on gig work, which would be expected to address aspects of the decision to which the companies object.\n\nLyft said it was disappointed in the outcome of the vote late Tuesday, along with dozens of exemptions granted to other industries but not the ride-hailing companies. \u201cWe are fully prepared to take this issue to the voters of California to preserve the freedom and access drivers and riders want and need,\u201d said Lyft spokesman Adrian Durbin.\n\nThe frustration aired by Ocasio-Cortez speaks to the grievances of the working class and the policy stances that shaped some of the proposals \u2014 such as sectoral bargaining \u2014 that have arisen from it.\n\nBradley Tusk, an Uber investor who previously served as a political strategist for the company, said the tech industry was alluring for departing Obama officials in the wake of the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cGoing to tech felt like you could make a lot of money without the social approbation of going to big Wall Street,\u201d Tusk said, citing the feeling of \u201cso-and-so just sold out\u2019, whereas you go to tech, you\u2019re making the world a better place ... Now a lot of that logic has proven pretty flawed.\u201d\n\nPresidential candidates including Warren (D-MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg have all expressed their support for the California bill. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom also signaled his support for the measure in an editorial on Labor Day.\n\nButtigieg late last month rallied in front of Uber\u2019s headquarters calling on state lawmakers to grant employee status to gig workers.\n\n[Uber rang in its IPO with champagne and mimosas. Then the hangover began.]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because where I come from, \u2018gig\u2019 is another word for \u2018job,'\u201d he said. \u201cThat means you deserve a minimum wage. That means you deserve protections from workplace and sexual harassment. That means you deserve overtime protections. And yes, that means you deserve a union.\u201d\n\nFormer San Antonio Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro, another presidential candidate who served as Housing and Urban Development Secretary under Obama, tweeted his support of the measure earlier this month.\n\n\u201cAs the gig economy grows, it\u2019s critical to insure that companies can\u2019t skirt labor protections,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBecause every worker deserves safe working conditions, benefits, and a union, I support #AB5, a bill that would bring workplace protections to a million Californians.\n\n\n\nAs the gig economy grows, it's critical to insure that companies can't skirt labor protections. \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) September 2, 2019\n\nTheir support has pitted them against an army of prominent Democrats who now shape policy for the ride-hailing companies. Part of what\u2019s driving the Democratic presidential push is a moved-up 2020 Democratic primary date for California, which will come three months earlier than in typical in the election cycle. The candidates have seized on the issue as a way to win over voters in what could become a critical battleground for those vying for the nomination.\n\nFormer senior Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett took a seat on Lyft\u2019s board of directors in 2017. Transportation secretary Anthony Foxx joined the company as chief policy adviser last year. David Plouffe, Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign manager, served as senior vice president of policy and strategy at Uber before departing in 2017. Tony West, who served as associate attorney general under the Obama Justice Department, now serves as Uber\u2019s General Counsel.\n\nWest is now lobbying against critical components of AB5, such as shifting the designation of independent contractors to employees. West said while Uber supported AB5, it doesn\u2019t agree with the notion that ride-share drivers would most benefit from employment. Rather, he said, drivers want the ability to log on to the app at their leisure and work on their terms.\n\n\u201cWe are not looking for an alternative bill,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for an additional bill \u2014 and one that really tries to speak to these fundamental issues of the quality and dignity of independent work.\u201d\n\n[Uber announces 435 layoffs on its product and engineering teams]\n\nWest argued the alternative Uber proposes \u2014 a $21 on-trip minimum wage, equivalent to about $15 per hour \u2014 \u201cportable benefits\u201d such as sick leave and injury compensation, and bargaining by sector, meet all of the standards advocated by Buttigieg. He noted that sectoral bargaining, which would allow workers to negotiate as a unit rather than on a company-by-company basis, was advocated by Sanders in his labor plan.\n\nEarlier in August, Warren was sharply critical of the companies\u2019 reactions to AB5 in an opinion piece for the Sacramento Bee outlining her support. She said the public should be skeptical of their proposed alternatives.\n\nSome \u201cof the most powerful gig companies have brought in armies of lawyers, lobbyists and consultants to spread disinformation and either kill the bill or water it down so it doesn\u2019t give workers the rights and benefits they deserve,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThese companies\u2019 approach would do little but sow confusion and uncertainty by adding other, still undefined, classes of workers whose rights are unclear \u2014 and perhaps unenforceable.\u201d", "description": "Former Obama officials have gone to work for Uber and Lyft.
