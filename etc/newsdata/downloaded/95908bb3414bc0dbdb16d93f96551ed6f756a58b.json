These dark, tempered glass tiles, which company CEO Elon Musk refers to as \"solarglass\" tiles, have been designed to resemble traditional roofing while supplying homeowners with the energy benefits of solar panels.\n\nTesla Solarglass roof https://t.co/7lw43mL92D \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 25, 2019\n\nAccording to Musk, \"integrated solar tiles only make financial sense for new houses or replacement roofs. If your roof is more than 5 years away from replacement, solar retrofit is recommended.\"\n\nThough only one type of solar tech-equipped shingle is available as of now, the company has plans to offer more styles in the future -- possibly every six to nine months -- including those that look like clay or other materials.\n\nBased on the estimate pricing outlined on the Tesla website, outfitting a 2,000-square-foot roof with the Solar Roof tiles will cost approximately $42,500 before federal tax incentives, a cost comparable to that of installing traditional shingles. This price, however, is subject to change depending on the complexity of the roof. Installations are set to begin over the next few weeks.", "description": "Tesla's latest version of its solar roof tiles -- originally announced back in 2016 -- finally launched on Friday.
