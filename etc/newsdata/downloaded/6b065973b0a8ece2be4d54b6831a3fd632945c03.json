You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely devastating. It was a pristine wilderness and it\u2019s just beyond belief. They killed thousands and thousands of animals by pouring silt over a beautiful wetlands and then steamrolling it into the ground,\u201d said Mr Ennis.\n\n\u201cEvery council, not just Dublin county council, must step up their game. They can\u2019t be preaching to ordinary members of the public about environmental consciousness and then continuously doing stuff like this.\u201d\n\nMr Ennis said the frogs and newts \u2013 which would have been buried alive \u2013 were protected under the Wildlife Act 1978. The space also supported a number of birds as well as mammals such as pine martens and badgers which will no longer have a source of food.\n\nThe wetlands were also home to European eels which are more endangered than giant pandas or elephants, with numbers having dropped by more than 90 per cent since the early 1980s. Populations of these fish have plummeted due to land reclamation, over-fishing and the damming of rivers.\n\nThey have one of the greatest migrations known in the animal kingdom. In autumn, mature eels travel more than 3,000 miles to reproduce in the Sargasso sea near the Bahamas, crossing both freshwater and seawater as they do.\n\nMr Ennis said: \u201cEuropean eel numbers across the continent have completely crashed so each adult is massively important for the survival of the species.\u201d\n\nSouth Dublin County Council was supporting plans to protect the one-hectare large reserve as part of its six-year masterplan, Mr Ennis said. It had agreed there would be minimum interference with the area, except for potentially implementing a boardwalk so it was more accessible to the public.\n\nHe said: \u201cAll their flashy campaigns and Internet ads mean nothing. It\u2019s all greenwashing. If they are serious about their green policies and biodiversity they should step up now and fix this issue.\n\n\u201cI honestly believe there was no malicious intent on their part because they have been unbelievably supportive to us. I think it\u2019s a miscommunication,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt just isn\u2019t good enough any more. It happens nationwide with hedgerow destruction, wetlands being drained and it\u2019s always \u2018We\u2019re sorry, shouldn\u2019t have happened\u2019 and nothing is done. It won\u2019t be the same for years but they need to start restoration work as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nWetlands are among the most threatened habitats, with a global loss of 87 per cent since the 1700s.\n\n\u201cThe rate of this loss has increased with the growth of urbanisation and with the demise of wetlands, you also lose the species that depend on them,\u201d said Alison Debney, a senior conservation programme manager at Zoological Society London (ZSL).\n\n\u201cThis includes the critically endangered European eel.\n\n\u201cUrban wetlands are also essential for local people. They trap dirt and pollutants that run off road systems or other hard paved areas before they enter rivers and provide excellent opportunities for people to connect with the natural world.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The council will immediately review the practice of the disposal of silt drained from lakes,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cHowever, best practice dictates that the material removed is placed as close to the origin as possible.\n\n\u201cThe council will continue to work to enhance the wetlands in Sean Walsh Park and in the county through its Constructed Wetlands Programme.\u201d", "description": "A unique wetlands habitat that was home to critically endangered European eels was \u201cdestroyed overnight\u201d\u00a0when the local council used it as a dumping ground for silt, ecologists say.\u00a0 Wetlands at Sean Walsh Memorial Park in Tallaght in south Dublin were once home to protected newts, frogs and bats as well as an abundance of insects and wildflowers \u2013\u00a0but now the area is said to", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/12/ireland-wetlands.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
