Franken was accused of sexual misconduct by several women in the fall of 2017.\n\nFranken claimed he was pressured to resign from office without due process. Since the resignation, eight of his fellow Democratic senators have apparently issued public apologies.\n\n\u201cIt was very gratifying,\u201d said Franken, \u201cTo get a U.S. senator to publicly admit, you know, he or she made a mistake, that's hard. And again, eight, you know, that's unusual.\u201d\n\nFranken also elaborated on why the eight senators apologized to him, telling Conan, \u201cSo they just basically all said that I deserved due process. And I believe I did, too.\u201d\n\nFranken said he did not want to resign, but without the support of his fellow Democratic senators, he could not be an effective leader. \u201cMy committee work would be at risk,\u201d said Franken, \u201cMy staff would be isolated. And I just couldn't serve the people of Minnesota.\u201d\n\nWhile Franken maintained his innocence in the matter, he did admit that the accusations have had a significant impact on how he has handled himself since then. \u201cI thought I must be doing something wrong,\u201d said Franken, \u201cEver since I've been a lot more mindful in my interactions with pretty much everyone.\u201d\n\nConan airs weeknights at 11 on TBS.\n\nWatch as Sean Spicer gets political on Dancing With the Stars:\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nTell us what you think!
