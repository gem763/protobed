And when Fesseau couldn\u2019t make him quiet, the neighbors turned to the courts in 2017, seeking Maurice\u2019s removal from the neighborhood \u2014 and launching a bitter two-year legal saga.\n\nIt became far more than a noise complaint. Rural mayors were outraged, seeing the lawsuit as a threat to their way of life brought forth by intolerant urbanites who refused to adapt to the sounds of the country. Tens of thousands of people came to Maurice\u2019s defense, signing an online petition to \u201csave our rooster.\u201d They wore T-shirts that said, \u201cLet me sing,\u201d which could be found in local stores. Other roosters and their owners even attended Maurice\u2019s court hearings, to show solidarity.\n\nAnd on Thursday, Maurice found one last ally: the judge.\n\nIn a long-awaited decision, a court in Rochefort, France, ruled that Maurice did not need to be quiet, French media reported. His cock-a-doodle-doo \u2014 or \u201ccocorico,\u201d as the French say \u2014 was not noise pollution under the law, the judge found.\n\nTo Fesseau, the ruling was a victory for more than just Maurice.\n\n\u201cToday Maurice has won a battle for the whole of France,\u201d the retired waitress turned local singer told Reuters.\n\nMaurice\u2019s crowing is just one of several countryside noises in France that have recently become the subjects of tense legal battles pitting rural and urban residents against each other. City people, arriving in the country for a peaceful getaway, just don\u2019t get it, critics have charged. All over France, they\u2019ve filed complaints against noisy cows in the French Alps, against croaking frogs in a garden pond and a flock of ducks in a woman\u2019s backyard. Tourists have asked one mayor to stop church bells from ringing and another to silence cicadas by killing them.\n\nAnd at the center of this \u201ccrisis over traditions\u201d of rural French life, newspaper the Local reported, is Maurice the rooster \u2014 the culture war\u2019s \u201cmascot.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s almost too perfect. The rooster is also France\u2019s unofficial national symbol, adorning stamps and sports logos and France\u2019s seal of the Republic.\n\nWhich is why, when Maurice\u2019s vacationing neighbors tried to shut him up, it didn\u2019t go over too well. Reuters described the case as a \u201cbattle for France\u2019s soul.\u201d\n\nThe legal saga began in 2017, when Maurice was still a baby. The neighbors, from the city of Limoges, had bought the vacation home in the early 2000s and visited several times a year, the Guardian reported. But when they returned in 2017 to find Fesseau had erected a chicken coop next door, they felt disturbed, constantly waking to Maurice\u2019s reliable daybreak singing.\n\nThere was only so much Fesseau could do to quiet him down. She draped black sheets over his coop so he wouldn\u2019t know the sun had risen, but even in the dark, Maurice still knew, AFP reported. She insulated his coop with egg boxes to make it more soundproof, but the neighbors still complained. Investigators were sent to listen to the cock\u2019s crowing at dawn, but they didn\u2019t think it was that bad.\n\nWhen the neighbors sued, Fesseau was shocked. She started the petition in August 2017, which now has nearly 140,000 signatures.\n\n\u201cWhat do we ban next?\u201d she wrote in the petition. \u201cThe cooing of doves, the cries of the seagulls, the birds that chirp every morning?\u201d\n\nInstantly, Maurice found support. As one fan wrote on the petition, \u201cThe crowing of the cockerel is the life of the village.\u201d The mayor of the village, Christophe Sueur, appeared to agree. He learned of the noise complaint but was not interested in citing Fesseau for being a nuisance. \u201cPut simply, I will protect the cockerel in order to defend our way of life,\u201d he said on a French radio show, the Guardian reported.\n\nThe town passed a symbolic ordinance vowing to \u201cpreserve the rural character\u201d of Saint-Pierre-d\u2019Ol\u00e9ron. Another rural mayor, Bruno Dionis du S\u00e9jour, penned a furious open letter to French Parliament, urging national legislation to end the assault on normal animal noises. He said he was shocked by \u201cthe selfishness of new fellow citizens, most of the time of urban origin, who discover the countryside like the idiot who discovers eggs don\u2019t grow in trees,\u201d the Telegraph reported.\n\n\u201cLet the crowing of the cockerel, the familiar bark of the dog, the church bell, the mooing of cows, the braying of the donkey and the chirruping of birds be inscribed into national heritage,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut lawyers for Maurice\u2019s neighbors disputed the premise that the noise complaint lodged against Maurice had anything to do with the rural-vs.-urban narrative that has dominated the case, saying the couple isn\u2019t \u201chostile to nature\u201d as they\u2019ve been presented.\n\n\u201cLook, they\u2019re not against the rooster,\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, Vincent Huberdeau, told the New York Times when the paper\u2019s Paris bureau chief visited Maurice. \u201cThey\u2019ve never asked for the death of this animal. \u2026 This is about noise.\"\n\nHuberdeau could not immediately be reached for comment on whether his clients plan to appeal the ruling.\n\nFesseau\u2019s lawyer, Julien Papineau, told AFP the plaintiffs were ordered to pay 1,000 euros in damages (or $1,102).\n\nAs for Maurice, now 4, he\u2019s still recovering from all the attention.\n\nWhen the Times visited him in June, Fesseau said he was \u201cvery stressed out\u201d and wasn\u2019t singing. She was worried about all the visitors making him shy, and by Thursday, she told reporters outside the courthouse that he was still unusually quiet.\n\nShe told CNN she hoped the ruling would bring his voice back.\n\n\u201cHe is a rooster,\u201d she said. \u201cRoosters have the desire to sing.\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\n\u2018Being Christian is love\u2019: Drew Brees defends appearing in video linked to anti-LGBT religious group\n\n\u2018I\u2019m about to die\u2019: A woman escaped a serial killer by stabbing him and jumping out a window, police say", "description": "In France, the rural-vs.-urban culture war is about animal noises disturbing vacationing city people.
