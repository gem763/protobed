She had been missing since 2003 but was not reported missing by family until 2013, prosecutors said. Osokow would not comment on why it took so long for the missing persons case to be filed.\n\nPennsylvania Crime Stoppers\n\nBabcock was interviewed in 2013 or 2014 when Jacobs was reported missing, Osokow said, and has now allegedly confessed to Jacobs' murder, though Osokow would not elaborate.\n\n\"When there is no swift resolution to an investigation, perpetrators do begin to believe that they can get away with murder,\" Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said in a statement. \"With the help of our State Police, that won't be true for Jade Babcock. May those who have been missing and mourning Brenda Jacobs for years know some peace in the very near future.\"\n\nWPVI\n\nBabcock was arrested on Tuesday and charged with abuse of a corpse, obstruction of justice and tampering with evidence.\n\nPhiladelphia prosecutors said homicide charges are expected. Osokow said homicide charge determinations \"will be made shortly.\"\n\nOsokow would not comment on a motive and said prosecutors have not yet been informed of Jacobs' cause and manner of death.\n\nBabcock, who is being held without bail, has not yet entered a plea. He is set to return to court for a status hearing on Oct. 18. It was not immediately clear if he had an attorney.\n\nABC News' Leonardo Mayorga contributed to this report.", "description": "Jade Babcock was arrested in connection with the disappearance of Brenda Jacobs.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/Jade-Babcock-ht-er-190919_hpMain_v4x3_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
