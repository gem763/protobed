That\u2019s the central concern of \u201cLost Transmissions: The Secret History of Science Fiction and Fantasy,\u201d a collection of essays by various hands, with half the text contributed by editor Desirina Boskovich and a graceful foreword by Jeff VanderMeer. \u201cThis book conjures up not just a sense of wonder,\u201d VanderMeer writes, \u201cbut also gives readers the sweet regrets of might-have-beens.\u201d Additionally, the compilation is lavishly illustrated and arrayed by master designer Jacob Covey.\n\n\u201cLost Transmissions\u201d focuses on all things fantastical, broadening its remit to include literature, film, television, architecture, art, design, music, fashion and fandom. But it\u2019s not solely concerned with a catalogue of phantoms. As Boskovich says in her introduction, the book will consider \u201cthe work of artists who, for whatever reason, did not receive their due.\u201d Meritorious cult figures, in other words, unappreciated and overlooked.\n\nThis variant of the might-have-been game does not focus precisely on seminal things that never happened, but on worthwhile things that did happen but engendered less-than-optimal consequences. In fact, the majority of the entries are along these lines and ultimately overpower the instances that look at formally unreified works. But in the end, the parallel themes prove satisfyingly complementary.\n\nThe intelligently curated selection of topics mixes some pretty well-known icons \u2014 artist Jack Kirby, writer Angela Carter, musician David Bowie \u2014 with some out-of-left-field wonders: manga creator Tsutomu Nihei, Afro\u00adfuturist writer Henry Dumas, TV show \u201cSpace Island One.\u201d Any reader\u2019s ratio of familiar to unknown topics will vary, of course. But as someone who\u2019s been immersed in fantastika for five decades, I\u2019d have to say that Boskovich scores pretty high on the worthily esoteric scale. There\u2019s plenty here to intrigue and enlighten even the most jaded reader/viewer/listener/game-player.\n\nBeyond George R.R. Martin: A critic\u2019s pick of science fiction and fantasy\n\nEach essay is meant to summarize the virtues and history of its subject and also place it in good historical context. On another level, the table of contents is meant to limn a kind of counter-canon, an alternate history of fantastika where, say, \u201cStar Wars\u201d is the minor hobbyist project of the guy who created \u201cTHX 1138\u201d and the transgressive novels of Kathy Acker (extolled with zest by Nick Mamatas) outsell those of J.R.R. Tolkien. Some of the essays do a better job of projecting the canonical potentials than others, but all succeed admirably in conveying what makes each topic worthy of our attention. All the contributors exhibit enthusiasm, knowledge and concision. The bite-size chapters make this a book that\u2019s easy to dip into whenever the reader has a spare moment.\n\nBoskovich sets the tone with a conversational style that enwraps solid scholarship. The other contributors follow suit, with lively essayists such as Grady Hendrix (\u201cIt\u2019s a Man\u2019s, Man\u2019s, Man\u2019s Apocalypse\u201d), Annalee Newitz (\u201cX-Ray Spex, Poly Styrene, and Punk Rock Science Fiction\u201d) and Ekaterina Sedia (\u201cThe Fashion Futurism of Elizabeth Hawes and Rudi Gernreich\u201d) bringing humor and erudition to bear.\n\nAmong the items that deal with unborn wonders, we learn about gems such as the Who\u2019s Lifehouse album (\u201ca science-fiction rock opera that would expand the potential of audience participation to dizzying new heights\u201d), C.S. Lewis\u2019s fragment of \u201cThe Dark Tower,\u201d Harlan Ellison\u2019s infamous anthology \u201cThe Last Dangerous Visions\u201d and Weezer\u2019s \u201cSongs From the Black Hole.\u201d\n\nUltimately, this book recalls the darker, pioneering, more transgressive work done by RE/Search Publications in landmarks such as \u201cIncredibly Strange Films,\u201d \u201cModern Primitives,\u201d \u201cAngry Women\u201d and others. And while \u201cLost Transmissions\u201d would like to sketch out a cultural counternarrative as complex and rich as Greil Marcus\u2019s \u201cLipstick Traces,\u201d it never quite attains that meteoric escape velocity. Nevertheless, the collection will broaden your horizons and turn you on to wonders bubbling under the mass-market commodified pleasures to which we all too often limit ourselves.\n\nPaul Di Filippo\u2019s most recent novel is \u201cThe Deadly Kiss-Off.\u201d\n\nLOST TRANSMISSIONS\n\nThe Secret History of Science Fiction and Fantasy\n\nWritten and edited by Desirina Boskovich\n\nAbrams. 304 pp. $29.99", "description": "The collection of essays focuses on all things fantastical.", "authors": ["Paul Di Filippo"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RITBVDWQ4AI6TMU3UUUNZAQVJI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
