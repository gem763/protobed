REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nMerlin, which owns and operates Legoland and Madam Tussauds, took on more than $3 billion (2.3 billion pounds) of debt to help to fund Blackstone\u2019s bid to take the company private in a deal worth $7.5 billion agreed in June, one of the largest European private equity transactions in recent years.\n\nAnalysts and investors are worried that the European Central Bank\u2019s unprecedented stimulus programme is driving investors into riskier debt. They expressed concerns about aggressive terms both on pricing and in the debt documentation on the Merlin fundraising.\n\nBlackstone did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMerlin had already taken out a \u00a32.193 billion loan as part of the leveraged buyout.\n\nOn Thursday, Merlin issued around $821 million-equivalent of bonds to help fund the buyout.\n\nAnalysts and investors said the bonds, split between a 370 million euro (320.1 million pounds) eight-year issue with a coupon of 4.5% and a $410 million eight-year dollar tranche with a coupon of 6.625%, was pushing new boundaries in terms of yields achieved on such debt.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think at this yield you are remunerated for the risk associated with some of Merlin\u2019s planned projects,\u201d said Benjamin Sabahi, head of credit research at independent analyst firm Spread Research.\n\n\u201cMerlin has a very strong track record, is well diversified, and has long-term agreements in place. But this time it\u2019s something larger, more aggressive from a credit perspective,\u201d he said.\n\nBond issues for leveraged buyouts generally tend to have a higher yield.\n\nBlackstone\u2019s buyout of Refinitiv in September 2018 was considered one of the most aggressive deals at that time, International Financing Review, a Refinitiv company, reported.\n\nThomson Reuters, the parent company of Reuters News, holds 45% of Refinitiv.\n\nAnalysts highlighted the terms in the debt documentation on the Merlin debt deal, which was seen by Reuters, as a particular area of concern.\n\nThe terms give Merlin significant leeway to raise further debt, allowing it to convert double the amount of its dividend payment allowance into capacity to raise debt, analysts at Covenant Review said. The analysts also said they had never seen such terms in a high-yield deal before.\n\nHigh-yield bond documents typically include restrictions on how much debt an issuer can raise, as well as how much it can pay in dividends and other distributions away from creditors \u2013 known as restricted payments.\n\nSabahi of Spread Research said the terms allowed the company to take on another 1.2 billion euros of debt for future projects and acquisitions, which would increase leverage by an additional 2.4x. Merlin will have a leverage of 5.9 times after the buyout, analysts said.\n\nThere have been a string of aggressively priced deals in the European junk bond market as investors demand for bonds has been supercharged by low supply and the ECB\u2019s decision to restart asset purchases, including corporate bonds.\n\n\u201cECB purchases are providing a broad-based demand for risk. You go to these [investor roadshow] lunches and they are unbelievably well-attended,\u201d said a London-based senior fixed-income analyst, who asked not to be identified speaking about the Merlin deal.\n\n\u201cI think that the language on these deals is broadly recognised. But the ability for people to do some sort of cohesive pushback against these deals is simply not materialising as people are hunting around for risk.\u201d he said.", "description": "A buyout consortium led by Blackstone sent a frisson through debt markets this week as it took advantage of a booming appetite for bonds to push through aggressive terms on financing for its leveraged buyout of Merlin Entertainments.", "authors": ["Abhinav Ramnarayan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442194142&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1WD", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
