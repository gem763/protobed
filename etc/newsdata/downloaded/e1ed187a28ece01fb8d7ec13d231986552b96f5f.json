In a simulation revealed in 2015, scientists showed the intricate process that will take place, with the two central supermassive black holes merging into one. And the newly formed super-galaxy, dubbed 'Milkomeda', will also ultimately spell disaster for Earth as our planet is flung out into interstellar space. The simulation was created by a number of institutions led by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (Icrar) in Western Australia. In the simulation it can be seen how the two galaxies will interact as they approach each other. First, in a tentative meeting, they will 'swoop' past each other, possibly disrupting some of the orbits of stars in the arms of each spiral galaxy. Then, after separating, the two galaxies will accelerate towards each other again. As Andromeda is larger than the Milky Way, with one trillion stars in the former compared to about 300 billion in the latter, it will technically be the one 'eating' our galaxy. The Milky Way is also expected to 'eat' two nearby dwarf galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, at some point in the future.\n\nThe Milky Way will inevitably collide with Andromeda galaxy in about four billion years' time, which will devastate the Earth\n\nBut Dr Mackey and his colleagues' research reveals the Andromeda, some 2.5million light years away from us, is no stranger to gobbling up other galaxies.\n\nA galaxy named Triangulum has been found alongside stellar streams \u2013 the remains of smaller galaxies or star clusters \u2013 within the Andromeda nebula.\n\nTracing how these collections of stars and planets were absorbed into the Andromeda has given an insight into how the galaxies have merged together.\n\nOne confusing element, the team found, was that they appeared to have collided from different directions.\n\n'This is very weird and suggests that the extragalactic meals are fed from what's known as the 'cosmic web' of matter that threads the universe,' said Professor Lewis from the University of Sydney.\n\n'More surprising is the discovery that the direction of the ancient feeding is the same as the bizarre 'plane of satellites', an unexpected alignment of dwarf galaxies orbiting Andromeda.\n\n'This deepens the mystery as the plane must be young, but it appears to be aligned with ancient feeding of dwarf galaxies.\n\n'We're going to have to think quite hard to unravel what this is telling us.'\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature.", "description": "Researchers from the Australian National University revealed the Andromeda galaxy has been absorbing and shredding smaller star systems for billions of years.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/17/19216344-0-image-a-2_1570034280253.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
