Mitt Romney being one. He\u2019s reacted to whistleblower reports saying, \u201cthey\u2019re troubling in the extreme.\u201d He says the president\u2019s phone call with the Ukraine president was \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d Now on the withdrawal of troops from Syria, he is saying, \u201cwhat we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history.\u201d I know you worked for Mitt Romney on his 2012 presidential campaign; when you look at Mitt Romney today and contrast him with the Mitt Romney you knew in 2012, any differences?\n\nSTEPHANIE GRISHAM: Yeah, one word comes to mind: \u201cPathetic.\u201d I would just remind Mitt Romney that he is not president. He lost, and he needs to quit pretending like he is president. We\u2019ve got a great president right now and he should probably get in line with that president, who is doing great things for this country, and Mitt Romney should be proud of that. He should be supporting this president instead of working against him. It\u2019s hard for me to actually hear the word Republican and Mitt Romney in the same sentence.\n\nREGAN: What do you think his motives are?\n\nGRISHAM: He\u2019s not president and he wants to be.\n\nREGAN: Really? Jealousy?\n\nGRISHAM: Yeah.", "description": "White House press secretary\u00a0Stephanie Grisham unloaded on Sen.
