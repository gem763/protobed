The official said Sondland helped \u201cnavigate\u201d the demands that Trump made of President Zelensky.\n\nSondland has called himself, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker the \u201cthree amigos\u201d running Ukraine policy.\n\nHe said all three were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Trump\u2019s direction to involve Giuliani, but that they were led to understand that involving Giuliani was the only way to develop stronger relations between Trump and Zelensky, including through a White House visit.\n\n\u201cOur view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the president\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine,\u201d Sondland said.\n\n\u201cHowever, based on the president\u2019s direction, we were faced with a choice,\u201d Sondland continued. \u201cWe could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky, which we all believed was crucial to strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian ties and furthering long-held U.S. foreign policy goals in the region; or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the president\u2019s concerns.\u201d\n\nSondland said he only realized later that Giuliani might have in mind a plan to gin up politically-helpful investigations in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign,\u201d Sondland said.\n\nThat claim has been disputed by other independent reporting, however. According to NBC, Sondland discussed Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company whose board Hunter Biden served on from 2014-2018, with Ukrainian officials at the White House, and continued that conversation in a separate meeting even after National Security Adviser John Bolton called that discussion inappropriate.\n\nSondland sought to cast his interactions with Giuliani as minimal, and claimed he had no idea that Giuliani's focus was on the Bidens. His prepared testimony says he only talked to Giuliani a handful of times, and while he admitted that Giuliani mentioned Burisma in a call, he claimed he took it as Trump's lawyer just giving one example of a corrupt company in Ukraine and not singling it out.\n\nSondland's testimony is brutal for the White House, though it's unclear whether he's being wholly transparent with the committees and how much of his testimony is aimed at protecting himself from legal jeopardy while shifting the blame wholly to Giuliani. The whistleblower\u2019s complaint that triggered the impeachment proceedings said that Sondland had helped \u201c\u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the president had made of\" Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nCover: Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, arrives to the Capitol for his deposition as part of the House's impeachment inquiry on Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019.
