Like smoking, it's unsafe and addictive", "language": "en", "text": "Vaping is just the newest tool in big tobacco companies\u2019 toolboxes, and it\u2019s clear that big tobacco hasn\u2019t learned their lesson.\n\nWith big tobacco being hit over and over again with lawsuits, bad press, and public realization of the dangers of smoking, the future was looking quite bleak, until the vaping industry came along. Instead of \u201csmoking,\u201d e-cigarettes, vape pens, and personal vapors (MODS) are \u201cvaped,\u201d the act of inhaling and exhaling aerosol (i.e. vapor).\n\nMany vaping (or e-cig) companies have sprung up in the past five years as the \u201ccure\u201d for cigarette addiction, offering a similar high, but allegedly without the same health risks of cigarettes. Instead, they are causing disease, mysterious illnesses, and even death, as reported recently. The Centers for Disease Control is urging people to stop vaping after multiple deaths and hundreds of mysterious lung illnesses.\n\nSALLY PIPES: BERNIE SANDERS' \u2018MEDICARE-FOR-ALL\u2019 MEANS WORSE HEALTH INSURANCE AT HIGHER COST FOR MOST AMERICANS\n\nHow did this all happen? Well, e-cigs do not have the same level of chemical toxins as traditional cigarettes, making them \u201csafer.\u201d Well, you can play with a loaded gun with the safety on. It\u2019s safer than if the safety is off, but you\u2019re still asking for trouble. According to research out of the University of California-San Francisco, smoking e-cigarettes daily doubles your risk of a heart attack and when combined with traditional cigarettes, your risk increases five-fold.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker, study after study has shown that while using e-cigs is not as bad as smoking traditional cigarettes, they are just as addictive.\n\nThat is precisely what the big tobacco companies are after. A new generation hooked on nicotine, delivered \u201chealthily\u201d through e-cigarettes, to replace the lost generation of smokers who are no longer lining their deep pockets.\n\nStudy after study has shown that while using e-cigs is not as bad as smoking traditional cigarettes, they are just as addictive.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2017, global cigarette volume sales decreased by 1.3 percent and industry analysts predicted that by 2022 the global cigarette volume would decrease by 8 percent. In the United States alone, the decrease in smokers is incredible: in 1965, 42.4 percent of the population smoked, down to 20.9 percent in 2005, and even further to only 14 percent in 2017.\n\nThe big tobacco companies were scared.\n\nWhat do they do? They buy (and create) a new product, a \u201csafer one,\u201d to sell, but not under their own tarnished brand.\n\nFive e-cig companies dominate 95 percent of the market (JUUL, MarkTen XL, Logic, Vuse and Blu). While those names don\u2019t sound like big tobacco, 35 percent of JUUL is owned by Altria Group (maker of Marlboro cigarettes), and MarkTen XL is also owned by Altria. Vuse is owned by British American Tobacco, Logic by Japan Tobacco Inc., and Blu by Imperial Brands. Altria and Philip Morris are also partnering to sell a new brand of e-cigs called IQOS.\n\nBig tobacco has simply repurposed themselves, under new brand names, to continue to profit off the pain and suffering of millions of people.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAnd they are profiting. In 2016, e-cigs took in $8.6 billion. In 2017, $10 billion, with that number projected to be double by 2023.\n\nBut while the numbers for big tobacco are looking up, the numbers for the American people are looking worse. It\u2019s not just those trying to quit that are getting hooked.\n\nMore than 2 million high school students used e-cigarettes in 2017. The U.S. Surgeon General reported that e-cigarette use among high school students is up dramatically with more of them vaping than smoking.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWith more than 13.8 million people in the U.S. using nicotine e-cigarettes, according to Altria, we have a new generation of lives destroyed by the tobacco industry, all based on false promises, again.\n\nThey say you can\u2019t quit, but you can. And you don\u2019t need e-cigarettes to do it. Each year 1.3 million smokers kick the habit. There are many resources to help, including free ones. If you want to avoid being one of the 480,000 annual deaths caused by big tobacco, then you can quit, too \u2026 and don\u2019t let your kids start.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LIBERTY VITTERT", "description": "Study\u00a0after\u00a0study\u00a0has shown that while using e-cigs is not as bad as smoking traditional cigarettes, they are just as addictive.", "authors": ["Liberty Vittert", "Liberty Vittert Is A Professor Of The Practice Of Data Science At The Olin Business School At Washington University In St. Louis", "An Ambassador For The Royal Statistical Society.
