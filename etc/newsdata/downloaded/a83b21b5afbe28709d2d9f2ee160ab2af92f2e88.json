[EIA/S]\n\nU.S. crude stocks fell 7.2 million barrels last week, more than analysts\u2019 expectations for 2.7 million-barrel draw, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed. Official figures will be released on Wednesday.\n\nTrump abruptly fired Bolton amid disagreements over how to handle foreign policy challenges such as North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan and Russia.\n\n\u201cThe market took that as a sign that the Trump administration may become less hawkish on Iran, open the talks and the possibility of the return of Iranian oil,\u201d said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.\n\nIran\u2019s crude oil exports were slashed by more than 80% due to re-imposed sanctions by the United States after Trump exited last year Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. In May, Washington ended sanction waivers given to importers of Iranian oil, aiming to cut Tehran\u2019s exports to zero.\n\nThe market was further pressured by the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s (EIA) lowering of its spot crude oil price forecasts, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.\n\nIn its latest monthly Short Term Energy Outlook, the EIA reduced its forecast for spot West Texas Intermediate crude prices for 2019 to an average of $56.31 per barrel from $57.87 in its August report.\n\nThe EIA also reduced its forecast for spot Brent prices for 2019 to an average of $63.39 per barrel from $65.15.\n\nOil prices were higher earlier in the session after Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s new energy minister and a longtime member of the Saudi delegation to OPEC and its allies, said the kingdom\u2019s policy would not change and a global deal to cut oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day would be maintained.\n\nHe added that the so-called OPEC+ alliance, which includes non-OPEC producers such as Russia, would be in place for the long term.\n\nThe OPEC+ joint ministerial monitoring committee (JMMC), which reports on compliance with the cuts, is due to meet on Thursday in Abu Dhabi.\n\nGoldman Sachs lowered its forecast on 2019 oil demand growth to 1 million bpd, down 100,000 bpd, but left its 2020 demand growth estimate broadly unchanged at 1.4 million bpd.\n\n\u201cOur oil supply-demand outlook for 2020 calls for additional OPEC production cuts to keep inventories near normal,\u201d Goldman analysts wrote in a note.", "description": "Oil prices edged lower on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump fired national security adviser John Bolton, who took a strident stance against Iran, raising speculation of a return of Iranian crude exports to the market.", "authors": ["Laila Kearney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428184565&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8902I", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
