But ultimately it is Defence's responsibility,\" he said.\n\nA Senate inquiry into the naval shipbuilding program instigated by Labor's Alex Gallacher will examine whether Australian companies are winning sufficient work.\n\nIn the case of the latest contract, Naval Group has contracted Schneider Electric France directly to provide the main switchboards, instead of its Australian subsidiary, despite the latter's track record as an existing supplier to the Collins class submarines.\n\nSchneider Electric had already been selected to provide the switchboards, which is one of the submarines' five main systems, under a sole-source approach.\n\nThe contract will see Schneider build the first switchboard in France before transferring manufacturing to Australia. And the company has only committed to sourcing the fabrication of the switchboards and heat exchangers from Australia, leaving it open to use other components from France.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sole-source approach has been taken with the submarines' main motor (Jeumont, another French firm), the weapons discharge system (Babcock) and diesel generators (German manufacturer MTU).\n\nOnly the batteries have gone to tender, with Adelaide firm Pacific Marine Batteries \u2013 which supplies the Collins class submarines \u2013 competing against French company Saft, which is Naval Group's long-term supplier, and American company Exide.\n\nNaval Group defended its approach, saying sole-source arrangements were pursued when there wasn't a viable option in Australia.\n\n\"We continue to seek opportunities to maximise Australian industry content within the context of capability, cost and schedule,\" the company said.\n\nThe Defence Department said in a statement that the current level of activities was always intended to be conducted in France because there was insufficient Australian personnel with the knowledge and experience to undertake preliminary design of the Future Submarine.\n\n\"The present level of spend in Australia does not reflect the level of Australian industry involvement for the entire program,\" the department said.", "description": "Key senator Rex Patrick is concerned about the amount of the work French companies are winning under the $50 billion submarine project.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2942%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/530d587a83d43a2d020ee62acbd0375724fe07d8", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
