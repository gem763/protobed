Instead, we got a fairly straightforward condemnation of American austerity: how it leaves the vulnerable to suffer without the resources they need, and the horrific consequences for the rest of society that can result.\n\n'Incel' violence is horrific, but Joker is complex, and doesn't take sides Read more\n\nThis message is so blunt that even I, a Marxist and philistine, found its message a bit too clobbering. How mainstream commentators have missed it and drawn the exact opposite conclusion is baffling.\n\nArthur Fleck, the protagonist and eventual Joker, is a poor, young, white, mentally ill man who works as a clown and seems to enjoy it. In the film\u2019s opening scene, he is beaten up by a rowdy group of teenagers.\n\nWatching this opening, I thought, here it is: in the very first scene, teenagers running wild on the streets of New York City, a classic rightwing trope in American cinema depicting a society (and its racialized underclass, in particular) that is out of control. We\u2019ll soon be told it needs to be reined in by some old-fashioned law and order and cracking of skulls.\n\nYet in the locker room of the clown agency, when a coworker calls the teens \u201canimals\u201d and \u201csavages\u201d, Arthur explicitly rejects dehumanizing the teens. \u201cThey\u2019re just kids,\u201d he responds. Bruises visible on his body \u2013 a body for which Joaquin Phoenix lost 52 pounds ahead of filming, with a disturbingly protruding spine and ribs, that is physically ravaged by the austerity-racked society Arthur lives in, wasting away in front of our eyes \u2013 he defends his assailants and rejects his coworker\u2019s racist epithets.\n\nSince critics depicted this as a film for the far right, whose overtly racist views are well-known, I expected the depictions of characters of color to be bigoted. But interestingly, almost all of the violence he eventually metes out as he sinks deeper and deeper into a full breakdown \u2013 save for the movie\u2019s final scene, at which point Joker\u2019s nihilistic brutality has fully blossomed, now wanton and indiscriminate \u2013 is against white men, many of them wealthy.\n\nA passing interaction with a neighbor, a single black mother who lives on his floor, leads to a disturbing and delusional romantic obsession with her . This culminates in a tense scene in which \u2013 on the verge of a full breakdown and after we realize the previous scenes of the two of them on a date and sitting at the hospital bedside of Arthur\u2019s mother were completely imagined by him \u2013 he walks into her open apartment.\n\nThe viewer expects an act of violence against her, perhaps even a horrific scene of sexual assault, by the lonely man who wants the beautiful woman but can\u2019t have her. In other words, the ultimate incel revenge fantasy. Instead, startled, she asks him to leave. He does.\n\nLikewise, in a scene whose political message was so blunt that it could have appeared in a mid-century Stalinist propaganda film, his social worker and counselor \u2013 another black woman \u2013 with whom he has a tense but clearly significant relationship, is forced to tell him that due to recent budget cuts, their office will be shutting down. Arthur asks her where he\u2019s going to get his medication; she has no answer for him.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t give a shit about people like you, Arthur,\u201d she tells him, referring to those who cut the budget. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t give a shit about people like me either.\u201d\n\nThe black, female public-sector worker is telling the white, male public-service user that their interests are intertwined against the wealthy billionaire class and their political lackeys who are slashing public services. Across racial and gender boundaries, the two have a common class enemy.\n\nYou can\u2019t get much less subtle, or much more diametrically opposed to the right\u2019s worldview, than this.\n\nIt is those budget cuts that drive Arthur deeper into madness. Similar attempted cuts likely drove sanitation workers to strike, resulting in the piled-up garbage constantly visible on Gotham\u2019s streets. These are clear allusions to New York City\u2019s 1975 fiscal crisis and the austerity it produced, which soon spread to the rest of the country.\n\nElites\u2019 condescending responses to the widespread suffering make things worse. Billionaire Thomas Wayne condemns Arthur\u2019s murder of his three employees (representing young, arrogant, rich Wall Street types) on the subway by calling the average person seething in the streets \u201cclowns\u201d. Don\u2019t they know that he wants to help them, the ultra-rich mayoral candidate asks. He is irritated he even has to explain this. His comments merely stoke the already burning fires of resentment, with Wayne\u2019s obliviousness at their misery rubbing salt in the wounds of average Gotham residents and driving them to the streets to protest Wayne and elites like him in clown masks.\n\nAnd, of course, when Arthur sneaks into a high-class theatre and confronts Wayne about what Arthur has been led to believe by his ailing mother \u2013 that Wayne, her former employer, is Arthur\u2019s father \u2013 the genteel billionaire, dressed in a full tuxedo, literally punches Arthur in the face. Again, political subtlety is not this film\u2019s stock and trade. How could reviewers miss this?\n\nWhat Arthur \u2013 and scores of others like him in Gotham and our own society \u2013 needs is a fully-funded Medicare for All or NHS-style health system that includes robust mental health services that provide him with the counseling services and medication that can save him (and others around him) from his unceasingly \u201cnegative thoughts\u201d and violent impulses.\n\nHe needs public programs that can provide a warm, encouraging environment for his creative impulses, allowing him to perform standup comedy or perform as a clown without becoming a laughingstock on national television or getting canned by an uncaring boss. He needs wages for his care work for his infirm mother or a robust elder care system that can respectfully take her under its care. He needs high-quality housing he can afford.\n\nArthur has more than his share of problems, but a few of them would have been solved, or at least adequately and humanely managed, in a society whose budgets were oriented more towards people like him than Wayne. But he does not live in that society, and neither do we. Instead of public services and dignity, he gets that most American of consolation prizes: a gun, and the sense of respect that, while ultimately hollow, has long eluded him.\n\nJoker\u2019s ending is bleak and one whose general thrust we knew going into the film: in addition to the three Wall Street types, an old mother, a coworker, a talkshow host and a billionaire couple have been murdered in cold blood; rioters in clown masks are running wild in the streets, cheering Joker on the hood of a cop car. In the final scene, Arthur is again speaking to a social worker, but now in handcuffs in an asylum. But it\u2019s too late to reach him, because he\u2019s no longer Arthur \u2013 he\u2019s the Joker, and the Joker has no qualms about killing her, too.\n\nRosa Luxemburg once famously framed the choice for our future as that of socialism or barbarism. Joker is a portrait of a society that has chosen barbarism. No one wants to see violence erupt in such a situation, but we shouldn\u2019t be surprised when it does.\n\nIn the real world, we aren\u2019t yet at that breaking point. And unlike Gotham, we have alternate paths on offer \u2013 represented best by the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, whose presidential campaign speaks to that roiling anger but channels it into humane and egalitarian directions. If we don\u2019t take it, and that anger continues to find a home in reactionary outlets, the barbarities we see in Joker might start looking horrifyingly familiar.", "description": "How have mainstream commentators missed the most obvious takeaway of the film?
