Those users have done over $207,000 in transaction volume in that span, more than for all other Ethereum games combined.\n\nWhile those user numbers may not seem awe-inspiring, it represents a steep increase from where Gods Unchained was several weeks ago.\n\nGods Unchained hit by cyberattacks after stance against Chinese censorship\n\nThe uptick in usage comes after some clever public relations work by the company behind the game, Immutable. On October 8, Blizzard, the American company behind Hearthstone, one of the most popular online games in the world with over 100 million users, levied a year ban (later reduced to six months) on gamer Chung Ng Wai (aka Blitzchung) for supporting Hong Kong liberation in a post-game interview.\n\nHong Kong has been the scene of pro-democracy protests for months, pitting it against mainland China, which has been working to rein in the semi-autonomous city as well as China critics. Blizzard\u2019s decision, which also stripped Blitzchung of $10,000 in winnings, was perceived as a move to placate Chinese gamers and powerful sponsors. Blizzard Entertainment president J. Allen Brack, disputes that view. He said in a statement, \u201cOur relationships in China had no influence on our decision.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, that same day, Gods Unchained tweeted that Blizzard valued \u201cmoney more than freedom.\u201d It said it would pay for Chung's lost winnings and provide him a ticket to upcoming tournaments. Though it\u2019s unclear whether Chung has taken the gamemakers up on the offer, others clearly have.\n\nIn September, the game never saw more than 251 users a day. In the last 10 days, however, it has surpassed its previous high of 440 users four times, setting a new record of 656 yesterday, October 17.\n\nGods Unchained levels up, hires former Magic: The Gathering executive\n\nOvertaking Hearthstone and gaining mainstream adoption won\u2019t come easily, however. For one thing, Immutable reported cyberattacks following its decision. When asked for comment by Decrypt about the nature of the attacks and whether the Gods Unchained team had been able to determine their origin, Immutable VP of Marketing Tyler Perkins declined to comment, saying only, \u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty focused on hardening our infrastructure.\u201d\n\nFor another, a huge part of the multibillion-dollar global gaming economy is viewers, not just players. In a bid to continue its PR play, Gods Unchained announced last week it would donate $1 for each viewer of the game on the Twitch streaming platform to the Electronic Frontier Foundation to protect online speech.\n\nWhile the game regularly hit over 100 viewers per hour on October 10, it has since levelled off to under 40 views per hour. (The Electronic Frontier Foundation has not yet confirmed the donation amount.) Hearthstone, meanwhile, remains the 12th-most watched game on Twitch with over 22,000 viewers at any time.", "description": "Ethereum-based game Gods Unchained wants to convince Hearthstone gamers to switch over by taking a stand on Hong Kong protests.
