We are LIVE bringing you the latest on #Imelda. pic.twitter.com/1wI1IZNe9E \u2014 The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) September 19, 2019\n\nStill, the Houston area faced heavy rains Thursday, leading forecasters to issue a flash flood emergency through midday Thursday for Harris County. In that area, forecasters said 3 to 5 inches of rain is possible per hour.\n\nSylvester Turner, the mayor of Houston \u2014 the fourth-largest city in the U.S. \u2014 joined other Texas officials in urging drivers to stay off the roads. And even as the intensity of the deluge around Houston began to weaken in some parts, the area of 4.7 million people was still getting drenched with 1-2 inches of rain an hour, and some areas were warned that the high water in their neighborhoods might not recede until the weekend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still putting water on top of water,\u201d said Jeff Linder, meteorologist of the Harris County Flood Control District.\n\nImelda is the first named storm to impact the Houston area since Harvey hovered for days in August 2017 and inundated the flood-prone Gulf Coast. The storm dumped more than 5 feet of water on the town of Nederland, Texas, near the Louisiana border.\n\nNo reports of deaths or injuries related to the storm were immediately reported Thursday.\n\nEast of Houston, some local officials said the rainfall was causing flooding worse than what happened during Harvey. In Winnie, a town of about 3,200 people 60 miles east of Houston, a hospital was evacuated and water was inundating several homes and businesses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as bad as I\u2019ve ever seen it. Right now I\u2019m in an absolute deluge of rain,\u201d Chambers County Sheriff Brian Hawthorne said Thursday morning as he took cover under a carport at an auto dealership in Winnie. The town \u201clooks like a lake.\u201d\n\nHawthorne said emergency workers completed more than 300 rescues overnight and some residents were up on their roofs because of rising floodwaters.\n\nAirboats from the sheriff\u2019s office and the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department were helping with the rescues, along with high-water vehicles, Hawthorne said.\n\n\u201cRight now, as a Texas sheriff, the only thing that I really want is for people to pray that it will quit raining,\u201d he added.\n\nTexas Department of Transportation spokeswoman Sarah Dupre said officials do not know exactly how many people were stranded in their cars on a more-than-25-mile-stretch of Interstate 10 that was closed between Winnie and Beaumont. Louisiana officials also closed a portion of Interstate 10 heading west into Texas.\n\nDupre said the department was currently working with local law enforcement on a plan to get people off the roadway.\n\nIn Beaumont, a city of just under 120,000 people about 30 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, authorities said all service roads were impassable and two hospitals were inaccessible, the Beaumont Enterprise reported. Beaumont police said on Twitter that 911 had received requests for more than 250 high water rescues and 270 evacuations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad. Homes that did not flood in Harvey are flooding now,\u201d said Jeff Branick, a presiding official with the title of county judge for Jefferson County, which includes Beaumont.\n\nDuring Harvey, Beaumont\u2019s only pump station was swamped by floodwaters, leaving residents without water service for more than a week.\n\nThe Jefferson County sheriff\u2019s office said in a Facebook post that residents of an area where a levy was deteriorating should use their boats to pick up neighbors and carry them to safety.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency for several counties, saying \u201clife-threatening amounts of rainfall\u201d have fallen and more was expected Thursday. Imelda\u2019s center was about 110 miles north of Houston early Thursday and was moving north-northwest at 5 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nHeavy rainfall occurred Wednesday in many areas. Thunderstorms spawned several weak tornadoes in the Baytown area, about 25 miles east of Houston, damaging trees, barns and sheds and causing minor damage to some homes and vehicles.\n\nCoastal counties, including Brazoria, Matagorda and Galveston, were hit hard by rainfall through Wednesday. Sargent, a town of about 2,700 residents in Matagorda County, had received nearly 20 inches of rain since Tuesday.\n\nKaren Romero, who lives with her husband in Sargent, said it was the most rain she had had in her neighborhood in her nine years living there.\n\n\u201cThe rain (Tuesday) night was just massive sheets of rain and lightning storms,\u201d said Romero, 57.\n\nShe said her home, located along a creek, was not in danger of flooding as it sits on stilts, like many others nearby.\n\nIn the Houston area, the rainfall flooded some roadways Wednesday, stranding drivers, and caused several creeks and bayous to rise.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Imelda weakened to a tropical depression after making landfall as a tropical storm Tuesday near Freeport, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph.\n\nThe flooding from Imelda came as Hurricane Humberto blew off rooftops and toppled trees in the British Atlantic island of Bermuda, and Hurricane Jerry was expected to move to the northern Leeward Islands on Friday and north of Puerto Rico on Saturday.", "description": "The remnants of Tropical Storm Imelda unleashed torrential rain Thursday in parts of Texas and Louisiana, prompting hundreds of water rescues, a hospital...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR691_flood0_ZG_20190919171803.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
