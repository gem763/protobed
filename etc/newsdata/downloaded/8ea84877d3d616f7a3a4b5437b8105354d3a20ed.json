Philadelphia would receive $6.5 million.\n\nThe talks are being overseen by a federal judge in Cleveland. But Purdue wants any settlement to apply to all claims against it, according to a person familiar with the talks but not authorized to discuss them publicly. That would include the nearly 2,000 lawsuits in federal court and the hundreds of other local government and state lawsuits filed in state courts.\n\nUnder the plan now on the table, Purdue Pharma would file for bankruptcy and transform itself into a \u201cpublic benefit trust corporation,\u201d with all profits from drug sales and other proceeds going to the plaintiffs, news reports said.\n\nThe Sackler family would give up ownership of Purdue Pharma and contribute at least $3 billion of its money toward the total, the reports said.\n\nThe amount being described in the proposed settlement pales in comparison to the cost of the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic, which has contributed to the deaths of some 400,000 people in the U.S. since 2000.\n\nGovernment health officials have pegged the economic toll of the prescription opioid epidemic at more than $78 billion per year, according to a 2016 estimate by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The figure includes the costs of medical care, addiction treatment, lost productivity and legal expenses.\n\n\u201cThe amount of money that\u2019s being offered in this settlement doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface for what\u2019s needed,\u201d said Ryan Hampton, a Los Angeles-based advocate who founded the nonprofit The Voices Project to mobilize people in recovery from opioid addiction. \u201cThis settlement deal is a complete slap in the face. We want to see Purdue have their day in court. We know more money will come if this case goes to trial.\u201d\n\nHampton, who worked on the first-ever U.S. surgeon general\u2019s report on addiction in 2016, said Thursday he has launched \u201ca massive effort\u201d among victims\u2019 families and people affected by the crisis to call state attorneys general and urge them to reject the settlement proposal.\n\nStamford, Connecticut-based Purdue declined to comment Thursday but said earlier in the week that it sees little good in years of \u201cwasteful litigation and appeals\u201d and believes a far-reaching settlement is the best solution.\n\nPurdue is privately owned and not required to issue public financial reports. But Decision Resources Group, a health care research and consulting firm, estimates Purdue brought in $13.6 billion from 2014 through 2018 just from sales of its OxyContin, Butrans and Hysingla opioid painkillers.\n\n___\n\nMulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Carla K.
