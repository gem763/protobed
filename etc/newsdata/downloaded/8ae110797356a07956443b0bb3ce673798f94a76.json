Ted Cruz on Wednesday called China \"the most significant long-term geopolitical threat facing America,\u201d as a high-stakes trade war converges with other flashpoints that are ratcheting up tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nIn a wide-ranging conversation with Yahoo Finance's editor-in-chief Andy Serwer, the Texas Republican and 2016 GOP presidential contender described his tour through Asia with stops in Japan, Taiwan, India, and Hong Kong.\n\nHe explained that his recent trip was designed to be a \"friends and allies tour\" with neighbors of China \u2014 with an emphasis on \"dealing with China's enhanced military aggression.\"\n\nCruz told Yahoo Finance that \"You know, China is modernizing its military, they're doing so in large part with technology, intellectual property they've stolen from the United States because they employ the theft of [intellectual property] as a policy agenda item. And that threat is very real.\u201d\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee member Sen.

Amid a protest movement in Hong Kong that\u2019s ensnared big U.S. multinational brands, Cruz also called out the broader business community for prioritizing profits over principals.\n\n\"[I] have a long spoken out against Chinese human rights abuses,\" Cruz said.\n\n\"What we're seeing now though is a more dangerous incarnation, which is U.S. companies, they're so desperate to make a buck in China \u2014 and I get it \u2014 it's a lot of money access to the Chinese market \u2014 but we shouldn't have our fundamental values \u2014 free speech shouldn't be for sale,\u201d he added.\n\nHe singled out Apple (AAPL) after it reportedly removed the Taiwanese flag from its emoji keyboard in Hong Kong, and also pulled two apps from its store that protesters there used to organize.\n\n\u201cI don't think U.S. companies should be willing to aid and abet oppression and censorship by the Communist government,\u201d Cruz added.\n\n\n\nJulia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.
