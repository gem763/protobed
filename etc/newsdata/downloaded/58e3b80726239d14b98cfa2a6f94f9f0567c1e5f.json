Here\u2019s How States Are Lowering Them Again.", "language": "en", "text": "Throughout much of last year, critics of the White House darkly warned that \u201cTrump sabotage\u201d of Obamacare would result in steep increases in premiums for Obamacare plans.\n\nThey predicted that Congress\u2019 repeal of the tax penalty on the uninsured, coupled with an administration rule lifting federal restrictions on short-term policies, would lead to double-digit premium increases in 2019.\n\nThe good news is that none of that has happened. To the contrary, average premiums for \u201cbenchmark\u201d plans\u2014policies whose premiums are used in calculating premium subsidies\u2014declined slightly (0.83%) in 2019, for the first time in the program\u2019s history.\n\nThe better news is that this overall decline was driven by seven states (Alaska, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon and Wisconsin) that obtained waivers to deviate from certain Obamacare mandates.\n\nPremiums in those states fell by a median of 7.48%, while premiums in the other 44 states and the District of Columbia rose by a median of 3.09% (see chart).\n\nThe message for policymakers is clear: Innovation by states is the key to more affordable health insurance.\n\nHow Obamacare Waivers Work\n\nSection 1332 of the Obamacare statute permits states to seek waivers from certain federal health insurance regulatory requirements.\n\nStates can obtain waivers to tap federal money that the government would otherwise have transferred directly to insurance companies as premium subsidies and use that money instead to pursue innovative reforms.\n\nThose arrangements must be budget neutral to the federal government.\n\nThe waivers that have been granted most commonly are for risk-stabilization programs. Although these programs vary from state to state, they follow the same general pattern: States blend federal premium-subsidy money with funds from non-federal sources to create a fund that helps pay claims for policyholders at risk of incurring high medical bills.\n\nStates must submit actuarial analyses showing that their arrangements would not increase federal spending.\n\nWaivers Are Working\n\nPremiums for benchmark plans in 2019 are lower in six of the seven states that have such waivers in place.\n\nThe median premium decrease in those six states was 10.72%. Premiums rose by a median of 6.32% in 31 of the 44 states and the District of Columbia that did not obtain waivers.\n\nThe median premium decrease in the 13 non-waiver states in which they declined was 5.67%, much lower than the median decrease in the six waiver states whose premiums fell in 2019.\n\n>>>The Right Way to Overhaul Our Health Care System\n\nAs of this writing, five additional states are seeking waivers for the 2020 plan year. Actuarial analyses submitted by those states forecast premium declines ranging from 5.9% to 19.8%.\n\nObamacare Isn\u2019t Working\n\nThese states are pioneering the way toward making health care more affordable by chipping away at Obamacare\u2019s rigidities.\n\nThe law\u2019s architects adopted a Washington-knows-best approach, believing that the law\u2019s tangle of mandates, subsidies, and penalties would result in 27 million people enrolling in exchange-based coverage.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nAn estimated 13.7 million people have individual health insurance policies, including policies sold on and off the exchanges, roughly half as many as the Congressional Budget Office forecast. That number has been shrinking since 2016, as premiums rose beyond the reach of people who don\u2019t qualify for government subsidies.\n\nOne reason Obamacare didn\u2019t work as planned was that the individual mandate didn\u2019t work as predicted. It failed to coerce people into paying an unattractive price for an unattractive product.\n\nGovernment estimators were slow to recognize this failure. The Congressional Budget Office, for example, last year forecast that mandate repeal would lead to double-digit premium hikes in 2019. That, combined with looser federal regulation of short-term policies, would lead to 16% rise in premiums, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThey were wrong again. Premiums, driven by the seven states that obtained waivers, fell.\n\nThere\u2019s little evidence that the mandate repeal or the Trump administration regulations led to an exodus of people in reasonably good health from the exchanges. Exchange enrollment held steady at 10.6 million.\n\nOverall enrollment in the individual insurance policies fell somewhat in the first quarter of 2019, but the decline was far smaller than in 2017 and 2018 when the mandate still was in effect. Average medical claims in the individual market rose by only 5.4% in the first quarter of 2019, compared with the first quarter of 2018, among the smallest increases since Obamacare\u2019s inception.\n\nHad healthy people dropped out in any sizable number, average medical claims would have risen by a far larger amount.\n\nObamacare\u2019s Washington-centric approach isn\u2019t working. State innovation is working. Risk-mitigation waivers have shown that giving states authority to repurpose a portion of Obamacare funds can reduce premiums.\n\nWhat Should Be Next for States?\n\nRisk-mitigation waivers are just the beginning of what\u2019s possible.\n\nThe Trump administration has invited states to submit bolder waiver ideas. It\u2019s receptive to waiver applications to deliver subsidies through personal accounts and to pursue other creative ways to make health insurance more affordable.\n\nStates should take advantage of that opportunity.\n\nWhat Congress Can Do\n\nCongress should go further by converting Obamacare\u2019s premium subsidies and Medicaid expansion entitlements into fixed grants that states could use to design and administer programs that increase health care choices and reduce costs.\n\nStates shouldn\u2019t have to seek Washington\u2019s permission to improve health care for their residents.\n\nThe Health Care Choices proposal, endorsed by more than 100 conservative leaders from across the country, outlines how such grants could be structured to finance the development of consumer-centered programs adapted to the circumstances of each state.\n\nCongress should pursue that reform.\n\nObamacare\u2019s centralized, inflexible structure is failing consumers. Congress should empower states to lead the way to reforms that increase health care choices and reduce costs.", "description": "Throughout much of last year, critics of the White House darkly warned that \u201cTrump sabotage\u201d of Obamacare would result in steep increases in premiums for Obamacare plans.", "authors": ["Doug Badger", "Visiting Fellow", "Doug Badger Is A Visiting Fellow In Domestic Policy Studies At The Heritage Foundation."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-09/GettyImages-651143122.jpg?itok=CtK4_-5s", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
