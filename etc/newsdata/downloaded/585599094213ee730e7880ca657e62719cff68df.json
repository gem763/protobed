The stake was worth as much as $1.5 billion in recent weeks, according to regulatory filings compiled by Bloomberg, before the company became officially insolvent on Monday.\n\nBy August, Fosun and Thomas Cook had managed to agree on a deal that would give Fosun 75% control of Thomas Cook\u2019s tour business and 25% of its airline, Reuters reported at the time. However, that deal fell through in September, The Guardian reported, as new debts piled up near the end of the summer holiday season.\n\nThomas Cook is far from Fosun\u2019s only stake in Western companies as 52-year-old Guangchang seeks to emulate American \u201coracle\u201d Warren Buffett. It also owns major stakes in France\u2019s competing tour agency Club Med, Cirque du Soleil, an English football club the Wolverhampton Wanderers, insurance and real-estate companies, and more.\n\n\u201cOur goal is very clear. We need to create a Buffett-style investment company, rooted in China but with global capabilities,\u201d he told the BBC in a 2014 interview.\n\nStill, he has plenty of room to run. Forbes estimates Guangchang\u2019s wealth at $6.3 billion, making him the 41st-richest person in China. For comparison, Buffett is worth an estimated 10 times more, roughly $82.5 billion.\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly said Fosun\u2019s 18% stake in Thomas Cook was \u201ccontrolling.\u201d It is not a majority stake, despite Fosun being the company\u2019s largest shareholder. It also has no board representation, a representative said.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Business Insider - Guo Guangchang, founder and chairman of Fosun International, had a $1.5 billion stake in Thomas Cook before the travel group's collapse on Monday..
