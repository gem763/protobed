From Edson Barboza to Tony Ferguson to Al Iaquinta, the \u201cMotown Phenom\u201d has faced some of the toughest challenges the weight class has to offer.\n\nIn an interview with MMA Junkie on Wednesday, however, Lee (17-5 MMA, 10-5 UFC) labeled his UFC 244 matchup against Gregor Gillespie (13-0 MMA, 6-0 UFC) \u201cthe most dangerous fight\u201d of his life.\n\n\u201cHands down, this is the most dangerous fight I\u2019ve ever taken in my life,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s a guy who\u2019s really dangerous. A lot of guys on the inside know he\u2019s got a legit shot to even beat Khabib (Nurmagomedov) or anybody else in this weight class.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the most decorated wrestler. Dude would be in the Olympics if it wasn\u2019t for Jordan Burroughs. Fighting somebody like this who not a lot of people know which makes him even more dangerous is going to be tough. I\u2019ve prepared 100 percent for this. I already know this is going to be the toughest fight I\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nGillespie currently sits atop an undefeated record, both inside the UFC and out, having finished his last five fights and 12 opponents overall. Despite having the bigger name recognition, Lee understands the threats Gillespie presents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s proving something to myself more than anything,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThis man is undefeated. No one has really figured him out yet. He ain\u2019t been beat, so he don\u2019t have that confidence. He\u2019s on the up and up and he\u2019s going to try to make a name off of me. It\u2019s proving to myself that I\u2019m still coming up and I\u2019m still rising. I\u2019m still going to be even bigger and better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, I\u2019m coming off two losses. That (expletive) eats at you. It\u2019s not easy having to rebound from that. So Gregor\u2019s going to have to face the worst of it, but I\u2019m going to make sure I give it to him.\u201d\n\nUFC 244 marks Lee\u2019s return to lightweight. After losing a five-round decision to Iaquinta, Lee elevated to 170 pounds where he was submitted by former champion Rafael dos Anjos by fourth-round arm triangle choke.\n\nWhile Lee acknowledged the weight cut will be much more difficult than his last fight, he implied the intent was always to return back to the weight class. It just happened maybe a little sooner than expected.\n\n\u201cIt was inevitable that I was going to go back down,\u201d Lee said. \u201cEven when I went up to 170. I fought the number three guy in that weight class at that time. It was a good fight, but I knew I was going to go back down.\n\n\u201cThe timing and everything worked out. More than anything, I just wanted to fight again this year. I only got one fight in. Welterweight was getting a little muddy, and it was time for me to move back down and make a change.\u201d\n\nUFC 244 takes place Saturday at Madison Square Garden in New York.
