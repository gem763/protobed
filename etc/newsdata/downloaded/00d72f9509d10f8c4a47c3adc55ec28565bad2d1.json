So I take responsibility for everything I didn\u2019t do as well or my campaign didn\u2019t do as well,\" Clinton said.\n\nHillary didn't lose the election because she was too serious. She lost the election because her and her family are the epitome of swamp creatures. Hillary's been in Washington, D.C. for decades. She's held multiple positions, from First Lady to Senator to Secretary of State. Her family is the political establishment that average Americans are sick and tired of.\n\nIt didn't exactly help her case when she was unrelatable and she numerous scandals take place on her watch. Voters held her personally responsible for the attacks in Benghazi. Her emails were just the icing on the cake.\n\nPeople were willing to take a risk on Donald Trump because they knew what they were going to get with Hillary: it'd be a continuation of the same tired policies as usual.", "description": "Yikes..10/03/2019 3:16:23AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/275/1c089583-3b57-4d6e-9f7a-c4d06acf3860.png"}
