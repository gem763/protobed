We literally suffered hell behind those doors.\"\n\nMeals were always eaten in silence and the children - with the exception of Rose - were beaten if they didn't complete their chores to their father's satisfaction.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nBut Daisy said he could also be a kind mind, stressing \"he never missed a birthday\", admitting he \"was like two different people\".\n\nIt was only after her husband died that Daisy discovered he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia.\n\nThe strain of dealing with his violent mood swings and raising so many children in an unhappy house with little money proved too much for Daisy and she suffered a nervous breakdown.\n\nIn the 1950s one of the common treatments for severe depression was electroconvulsive therapy, where seizures are induced with electric shocks.\n\nBut while Daisy was being treated, without anaesthetic, she was pregnant with Rose - something that is only done as a last resort today.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/Press Association Images)\n\nShe said: \"I was awake and they attached something to my head and told me to bite down on a piece of wood - and then I blacked out.\"\n\nMoney was scarce in the family home, there were no holidays, the children did not have bikes and were not allowed to listen to pop music.\n\nAnd when 15-year-old Rose brought Fred West home to meet her parents her father was furious.\n\nHe was 27 and already a father to two young daughters, Charmaine and Anna Marie.\n\nDaisy said: \"We instantly disliked him.\"\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nRose wouldn't stop spending time with Fred and eventually her parents contacted social services and their daughter was placed in care.\n\nAs soon as she was 16, and could no longer be kept in care, she immediately went to see Fred, who was living in a caravan with his two young daughters.\n\nFurious, her father stormed to see the couple and threatened to \"cut Fred into little pieces\".\n\nNothing could stop Rose and eventually she moved out of the family home and in with Fred.\n\nBefore long, Rose fell pregnant with her first daughter, Heather, who would later be found dead in the family home.\n\nShe was just 17.\n\nShortly after Heather was born, a sobbing Rose returned to her family saying she \"had had enough\".\n\nFred followed shortly after.\n\nDaisy said: \"He turned up and said 'Rosie, you know what's between us'.\n\n\"Rosie never talked much but she turned to her father and said to him ' you don't know him, there's nothing he wouldn't do - even murder'.\"\n\nRose left that day with Fred but little did her family know that Fred had already killed his ex Rena, and his daughter, Charmaine was also dead.\n\nOver the coming years, Daisy and Bill's contact with their daughter was sporadic but whenever they did visit it was clear Rose had been crying.\n\nAnd on one visit, her brother Gordon went to make himself a cup of tea in the kitchen, where several bodies were buried, and he was violently attacked by Fred.\n\nAfter Daisy moved to her tiny bungalow away from Gloucester, Fred, Rose and their eight children came to visit.\n\nIt was one of the last times Daisy saw her daughter.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nShe said: \"I just made tea and cut and made some sandwiches.\"\n\nAt the time, Rose's eldest daughter, Heather, was missing and Daisy asked if she had heard from her.\n\nShe said: \"She turned away and walked across the room and she said 'no, she's off with her cronies'.\"\n\nDaisy said her daughter always insisted she was happy with her husband.\n\nShe said: \"Would someone who was involved in that say 'I'm happy mum'.\"\n\nThe first Daisy knew about her the horrific abuse and murders her daughter and husband had carried out was when she saw police digging up their home on he news.\n\nFred and Rose West's victims include their daughter, Heather, Alison Chambers, Shirley Robinson, Juanita Mott, Shirley Hubbard, Theresa Siegnethaler, Lucy Partington, Carol Ann Cooper, Lynda Gough, Rena Costello, Charmaine West and Anne McFall.\n\nFred is also believed to have murdered Mary Bastholm, although her body has never been found.", "description": "Fred and Rose West were responsible for 12 murders with many of their victims buried at their home at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Pa", "Sw Pics", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Pa Archive Press Association Images", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20066321.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rosemary-West-collect-photo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
