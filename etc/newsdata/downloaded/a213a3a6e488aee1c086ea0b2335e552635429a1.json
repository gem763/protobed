REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nNetflix has lost 30% since the end of June, and if that decline holds until Monday, it will have been the worst quarterly performance for the video streaming heavyweight\u2019s shares since 2012.\n\nUpcoming streaming services from Walt Disney and Apple (AAPL.O) have added to worries about Netflix\u2019s slowing subscriber growth and rising costs as it increases spending to create top-tier series like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown\u201d.\n\nViewed as the most dangerous threat to Netflix, Disney+ is set to launch on Nov. 12, with a slate of new and classic TV shows and movies from some of the world\u2019s most popular entertainment franchises. Disney\u2019s shares are up 14% since April 11, when it unveiled its new service. Apple\u2019s Apple TV+ service debuts on Nov. 1, adding to competition from Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Hulu and others.\n\n(Graphic: Netflix's stock reacts to growing competition, here)\n\nPointing to growing competition and higher costs, Pivotal Research on Tuesday slashed its price target for Netflix\u2019s stock to $350 from $515.\n\n\u201cOur new forecasts imply they are going to respond to content cost acceleration by revving up their own content spend that will allow them to maintain their subscriber growth while pushing back profitability materially,\u201d Pivotal analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak wrote in a client note.\n\nIn another report, KeyBanc Capital Markets warned that weak results or guidance when Netflix posts its third-quarter report on Oct. 16 could worsen investors\u2019 concerns about long-term growth.\n\n\u201cOnly very significant upside in 3Q is likely to drive sustainable upside in the shares, and we have little to provide confidence in that outcome,\u201d KeyBanc equity research analyst Andy Hargreaves wrote.\n\nDisney\u2019s stock in the past month has traded at 23 times expected earnings, its highest forward earnings valuation since 2004, according to Refinitiv data. As investors reconsider the value of Netflix, its forward earnings multiple has tumbled to 52, the lowest since 2011, from 82 in early July.\n\nForty-five analysts cover Netflix\u2019s stock, with a median price target of $410, down from $420 in late June. Its current price target is 60% above Netflix\u2019s current price of $255.", "description": "Shares of Netflix dropped nearly 4% on Tuesday and were on track for their deepest quarterly decline in seven years after two analysts added to growing worries about an impending wave of competition from Walt Disney and other rivals.", "authors": ["Noel Randewich", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433425458&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1P5-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
