They trail the Houston Astros, 3-2, with Game 6 in Houston on Tuesday night. And should the Nationals win that contest, which will be started by Stephen Strasburg, they are still waiting to see whether Scherzer could pitch in a do-or-die Game 7 on Wednesday. As of Monday afternoon, when Manager Dave Martinez held a conference call with reporters, Martinez only offered that he had not yet spoken to Scherzer. Martinez added that the 35-year-old ace is likely to rest while letting a cortisone shot, injected Sunday, kick in.\n\n\u201cAs we all know Max, he\u2019s going to try to push it a little bit,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cBut we want to just let this medicine kick in a little bit and see where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe consensus among Scherzer\u2019s teammates, coaches and the Nationals\u2019 front office is simple: If Scherzer couldn\u2019t go in Game 5 of the World Series \u2014 or any game, really \u2014 he has to be in serious, serious pain. But that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t do everything to pitch if Washington extends its season. Doctors told Scherzer it should take 48 hours to alleviate the nerve irritation. Martinez described a 24-hour window before Scherzer could feasibly begin testing his arm. Scherzer has dealt with neck spasms at various points of his career, but he described this as \u201cthe most severe one of all time.\u201d So now he waits to see whether the pain subsides.\n\nAnd now the Nationals cross their fingers and hope.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve pitched through so much crap in my career that would be easy to pitch through at this point,\u201d Scherzer said Sunday. \u201cThis is literally impossible to do anything with.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf Scherzer can\u2019t start Game 7, should the Nationals make it there, An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez will be on regular rest after throwing 93 pitches Friday. S\u00e1nchez shortened his between-starts bullpen session Sunday in case Martinez needed him in relief in Game 5. Indications were that S\u00e1nchez could have given the Nationals up to an inning. But since Martinez didn\u2019t need him to \u2014 and instead filled 27 outs with Joe Ross, Tanner Rainey, Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson \u2014 S\u00e1nchez ended the night by completing his throw day. He was in the bullpen, tossing in full uniform, as the Astros finished a lopsided win.\n\nThe Nationals should also have Patrick Corbin available in relief. The wrinkle is that the left-hander could be called upon in Game 6 to pitch an inning or face lefties such as Michael Brantley, Yordan Alvarez or Josh Reddick. Game 6 comes just three days after Corbin threw 96 pitches in a Game 4 loss. Game 7 would give him three days of rest \u2014 one fewer than he usually gets between starts but typical of his workload this postseason. No pitcher had ever made three starts and four relief appearances in the same playoffs. Corbin has, to mixed results, and it\u2019s likely his work in this series is not finished.\n\nMartinez noted Monday that he will approach Game 6 as if it is a Game 7. That means both S\u00e1nchez and Corbin could follow Strasburg out of the bullpen. But Martinez also acknowledged that Corbin and S\u00e1nchez\u2019s usage will be connected to how Scherzer\u2019s body responds to treatment. If it appears as if he will be good for Game 7, Martinez would be more likely to empty his staff to even the series. If it appears as if Scherzer\u2019s season is over, Martinez may be hesitant to burn both Corbin and S\u00e1nchez on Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be a Game 7 if we can\u2019t get out of Game 6,\u201d Martinez said Monday. \u201cOur focus is on winning tomorrow and going 1-0 and go from there.\u201d\n\nGoing from there, in Washington\u2019s perfect world, would be getting a win to give Scherzer the ball with everything on the line. But the Nationals are still unsure of what they can and can\u2019t count on in the final days of a seven-month season. And maybe it\u2019s fitting that they have one final obstacle to overcome.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Scherzer's status for Game 7 could affect how Manager Dave Martinez uses his pitchers in Game 6.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tCMEptr2edMRuYpdNEhWkF8ctpU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GIJGHSXZH4I6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
