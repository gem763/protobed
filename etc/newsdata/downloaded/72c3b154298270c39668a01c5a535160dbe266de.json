With far more Class B shares than Class A shares, such a shift would give Class B holders a major say in important decisions such as who sits on the board.\n\nI think what the board is saying is that it is not necessarily a permanent suspension\n\nThe dividend announcement came as the company reported a quarterly loss of $41 million for the period ending Sept. 30, 2019, more than doubling its losses from a year ago, and sending its shares plunging. The Class B shares closed down 29 per cent at 60 cents in Toronto\n\n\u201cCertainly this five quarter time frame between now and then (of not handing out dividend payments) is going to be really helpful to us,\u201d the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Lorenzo DeMarchi, told investors and analysts on a conference call Wednesday morning.\n\nTorstar had been paying a quarterly dividend of 2.5 cents per share for the last three years to both classes of shareholders. Between 2012 and 2015, the company was paying out slightly over 13 cents per share.\n\n\u201cI think what the board is saying is that it is not necessarily a permanent suspension \u2026 at least through the end of 2020 no one should anticipate a dividend and then depending on where we are at that point the board will reevaluate again,\u201d DeMarchi said.\n\nTorstar did not respond to a request for comment on the potential consequences of the continued suspension of its dividend payments for more than eight quarters.\n\nThe company\u2019s revenue continued to decline as it struggled to offset shrinking print advertising revenue with digital subscriptions and online ads. Operating revenue for the quarter fell 12 per cent to $111.8 million, compared to $126.4 million a year ago.\n\nTorstar\u2019s print and digital subscriptions for the quarter from its 80 daily community publications and three daily publications including the Toronto Star accounted for 27 per cent of total operating revenue for the quarter. Digital advertising revenue for the quarter was just 12 per cent.\n\nAdding to Torstar\u2019s woes this quarter was the underperformance of VerticalScope Inc., a digital publisher that operates hundreds of websites and online forums which Torstar acquired in 2015 for $180 million. Adjusted EBITDA for VerticalScope was down by $0.7 million for the quarter, which management attributed to declines in search-related traffic due to a change in Google\u2019s search algorithm.\n\nVerticalScope had laid off close to 50 employees in 2018, part of cost-cutting measures in light of Google\u2019s algorithm change.\n\nTorstar also disclosed that it would improve its accounting methods with regards to reporting gains or losses from its 56 per cent investment in VerticalScope, after a review by staff of the Corporate Finance Branch of the Ontario Securities Commission.\n\n\u201cWe no longer present or discuss operating results of the digital ventures segment separately as the segment without the inclusion of VerticalScope is too small to be considered a reportable segment,\u201d the company said in Wednesday\u2019s earnings statement. Torstar had previously not consolidated VerticalScope\u2019s debt into its balance sheet.\n\nTorstar\u2019s Class A shares are controlled primarily by the Torstar Voting Trust, whose chair John Honderich is also chair of the board of directors and the company\u2019s former president and publisher.\n\nThe company was founded in 1958 after the Ontario government barred the provisions in the will of former Toronto Star owner Joseph Atkinson \u2014 who wanted to set up a charitable foundation \u2014 from being enacted. Since then, Torstar\u2019s governance has been closely guided by six \u201cAtkinson Principles.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With files from Colin McClelland", "description": "Torstar's ownership structure is designed such that if the company misses dividend payments for eight quarters in a row, Class B shares obtain voting rights", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/torstar-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
