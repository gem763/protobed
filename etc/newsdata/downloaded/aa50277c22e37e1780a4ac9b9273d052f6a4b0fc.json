So far, there\u2019s been no Twitter-based boast from one Mr. Musk on the issue.\n\nThe two Model Ss at the \u2018Ring are clearly not like ones that you can currently buy. Their wheel wells bulge to contain huge wheels and tires. Oh, and those tires, according to snapshots from the track, appear to be hyper-aggressive Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 Rs. The car also wears what appears to be a hastily applied plastic extension to the Model S\u2019s modest rear spoiler. Their badges read \u201cModel S P100D +\u201d and are widely assumed to be running a three-motor system (two motors on the rear axle) in place of the standard car\u2019s single front and single rear motors. This looks very much like cheating. And it may well be. On the other hand, there are no rules to this particular game, since there is no sanctioning body to police such matters.\n\nIt may well be that Tesla will soon offer such a configuration for the general public. If so, it might be fair to call whatever official lap time results from this a production-car record. Seems pretty unlikely, though, that many Tesla buyers would opt for the barely-road-legal track tires fitted to the test car. So far, we haven't heard back from Tesla with any official details on the car or its future.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that technically Porsche ran its Taycan lap before that model was even unveiled. It wore camouflage during its record run. Porsche now says that the record-setting Taycan was actually a Turbo model and the not the Turbo S model that a Porsche spokesperson said it was. So is it possible that Porsche might have an even faster time in its pocket.\n\nAuto Motor und Sport also reports that Tesla has enlisted the services of two sports-car racing pros, Thomas Mutsch and Andreas Simonsen, along with Swedish driver Carl Rydquist to do the driving duties. Tesla apparently turned down one-time Formula 1 world champion and burgeoning Internet troll, Nico Rosberg, who publicly offered to run the \u2018Ring laps.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "One observer hand-timed a lap nearly 20 seconds faster than Porsche's published time for the Taycan.", "authors": ["Daniel Pund"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RLqVmSdLDMkxPMZ2hiwvNg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/8923dd1a93be67dbabef50dc0207e802", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
