REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo\n\nMugabe, who ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years until he was ousted by his own army in November 2017, died in a Singapore hospital six days ago aged 95. His body arrived in Zimbabwe from Singapore on Wednesday and was due to lie in state on Thursday.\n\nHe is proving as polarising in death as he was in life, as the fight over where he will be buried threatens to embarrass his successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nMnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party want Mugabe buried at a national monument to heroes of the liberation war against white minority rule. The government had planned for a state funeral on Saturday and then burial on Sunday.\n\nBut some of Mugabe\u2019s relatives have pushed back against that plan. They share Mugabe\u2019s bitterness at the way former allies including Mnangagwa conspired to topple him and want him buried in his home village.\n\nLeo Mugabe, the late president\u2019s nephew, told Reuters the burial ceremony would be private, without saying where it would be.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you that it won\u2019t be private,\u201d he said.\n\nThe family on Thursday issued a statement saying it was concerned about the manner in which the government was preparing the programme for Mugabe\u2019s funeral \u201cwithout consulting his immediate family\u201d.\n\nThe family \u201calso observed with shock that the Government of Zimbabwe is attempting to coerce us to accept a programme for funeral and burial\u201d which was contrary to Mugabe\u2019s wishes, the statement said.\n\n\u201cWe are ready and willing to work with the government to develop a programme for the funeral and burial of the late Robert Gabriel Mugabe which is in conformance to his wishes on how his mortal remains will be interred,\u201d the family said.\n\nPAYING RESPECTS\n\nMnangagwa, flanked by security and half a dozen soldiers carrying rifles, visited Mugabe\u2019s palatial home in the capital, known as Blue Roof, on Thursday to pay his respects.\n\nA choir wearing yellow T-shirts bearing Mnangagwa\u2019s face sang songs and played percussion as he arrived. He was later followed into the house by army officials and Mugabe family members.\n\nAround a hundred well-wishers sat under a marquee on a lawn beneath the main house, waiting to pay their respects.\n\n\u201cAs long as ZANU-PF is in power and as long as I am leading, no one will deviate, you remain our icon, our commander and founding father,\u201d Mnangagwa said of Mugabe, addressing Mugabe\u2019s relatives and associates inside the room where the coffin draped in the Zimbabwean flag was being kept.\n\nLater on Thursday, Mugabe\u2019s body will lie in state at a Harare soccer stadium where ordinary Zimbabweans and supporters are expected to pay their respects. The body was then to be taken to his rural home in Kutama, 85 kilometres (50 miles) from the capital.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nA few thousand people, mostly supporters in ZANU-PF T-shirts, waited to pay respects at the Rufaro Satdium, the same venue where he took his first oath at independence in 1980.\n\nMugabe presided over an economy wrecked by hyperinflation, shortages and deeply entrenched corruption, and a raging political rivalry between the country\u2019s two largest political parties, ZANU-PF and the opposition MDC.\n\nBut many Zimbabweans also remember Mugabe as their country\u2019s liberator from white minority rule and for broadening people\u2019s access to education and land.", "description": "Zimbabwe's former president Robert Mugabe will be buried next week at a private ceremony at an as-yet-undisclosed location, his family said on Thursday, rejecting plans by the rulers that overthrew him to inter him at a state monument.", "authors": ["Macdonald Dzirutwe", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429029946&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0RF", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
