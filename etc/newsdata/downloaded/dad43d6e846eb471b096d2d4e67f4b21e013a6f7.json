so far...\n\nAfter the Antonio Brown circus in pre-season, the Raiders looked doomed. Yet, despite all the commotion under Gruden and questionable draft picks, the Raiders beat the hopeless Broncos on the road and even upset play-off contenders Indianapolis Colts last time out to arrive at 2-2.\n\nChicago Bears so far...\n\nBolstered by an outstanding defence, terrorising teams all over the country, the Bears are Super Bowl contenders. But to break through their offence must show signs of giving a hand to their defence and with Mitch Trubisky under centre, it has not looked promising.\n\nThe third-year QB is nursing a shoulder injury and misses out here, but could return by week seven. That gives Chase Daniel a chance to help carry the team during Trubisky\u2019s absence against Oakland with a bye next week and the potential for their first round pick to resume duties against the Saints the week after.\n\nKey Players\n\nRaiders: Darren Waller\n\nThe tight end is providing Derek Carr with a dominant force down the field and he may be needed more than ever this week.\n\nWith Tyrell Williams and J.J. Nelson doubtful, Waller, the NFL\u2019s leading tight end receiver, could be flexed outside and asked to shoulder even more of the pass-catching burden.\n\nBears: David Montgomery\n\nYes, Khalil Mack is the centrepiece to a hellacious defence, but if the Bears are going to roll and justify their status as Super Bowl contenders, they require a spark on offence. With or without Trubisky, it looks like that will come away from the quarterback and passing game, meaning first-round pick David Montgomery must step up and deliver some electricity to an otherwise stale offence.\n\nOdds\n\nRaiders 2/1\n\nBears 2/5\n\nRaiders (+5) 10/11\n\nBears (-5) 10/11", "description": "The first London game of the NFL season is here with the Oakland Raiders taking on the Chicago Bears.
