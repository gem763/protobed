Xi made the comments at a Politburo Committee session on blockchain technology trends on Oct. 24.\n\nBlockchain adoption promotes innovation\n\nXi stressed that the implementation of integrated blockchain technologies is key in promoting technological innovation and transforming industries. He told the committee:\n\n\u201cWe must take blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies, clarify the main directions, increase investment, focus on a number of key technologies, and accelerate the development of blockchain and industrial innovation.\u201d\n\nBlockchain, not Bitcoin\n\nXi\u2019s push for greater blockchain adoption comes against the backdrop of China\u2019s long-standing aversion to \u2014 and a crackdown on \u2014 cryptocurrencies. Authorities in the country first banned ICOs in 2017, quickly followed by cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThere have even been reports that at least one government agency is considering a ban on cryptocurrency mining.\n\nDigital currency arms race\n\nUnsurprisingly, the one cryptocurrency that the Chinese government doesn\u2019t seem to have an issue with is its proposed central bank digital currency (CBDC). Despite reports throughout the summer that the launch of this was imminent, officials from China\u2019s Central Bank last month said that there was no timetable for the launch of the CBDC.\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has been referencing the threat of Chinese superiority in the digital currency space in an attempt to sell U.S. lawmakers his plans for the Libra stablecoin.\n\n\"China is moving quickly to launch a similar idea in the coming months. We can't sit here and assume that because America is today the leader that it will always get to be the leader if we don't innovate,\u201d he argued in an official statement.", "description": "China\u2019s Xi calls blockchain technology an important breakthrough for independent innovation, urging to accelerate its development", "authors": ["Jack Martin"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNWJhM2IyMzc0MWE3YjA2MTA0YWYyMWNhYzY5YWFmNjIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
