We ... currently do not have Max-related capacity in our schedule through Jan 5, 2020.\"\n\nBoeing is under pressure to deliver updated software and training to regulators for the aircraft to fly again, and the company has been negotiating compensation with customers like Southwest over the financial hit from the grounding.\n\nSouthwest, with around 10,000 pilots represented by SWAPA, had 41 more Max jets on order for this year alone.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Transport - [WASHINGTON] Southwest Airlines pilots predicted on Monday that the grounded Boeing 737 Max airplane will return to the skies around February, weeks later than Boeing and airlines have projected. .
