Henderson chose not to reveal the details of the conversation after the game, but sources close to the row have alleged that Balakov had attempted to tell England\u2019s players there was nothing to get upset about.\n\nBalakov claimed after the game that he had not heard any racist chanting on the touchline and that would seemingly tally with what he is believed to have said to England\u2019s players. As they spoke with referee Ivan Bebek and the Uefa delegate about the monkey chanting coming from the stands, England players believe Balakov told them: \u201cWhat is wrong? This is normal.\u201d\n\nThat sent some members of Southgate\u2019s squad into a rage and Henderson said: \u201cI obviously wasn't happy with the situation that we were in, it wasn't nice to be involved in and it shouldn't be happening in 2019, it is very disappointing.\n\n\u201cBut, at the same time, I felt as though as a team we dealt with it so well, we touched on it before we came here just in case it did happen and unfortunately it did.\n\n\u201cSo we spoke together and the decision was that we carried on because if you leave the pitch and stop the game they win, really.\n\n\u201cThat is how we looked at it, it is what the message was in the dressing room at half-time and we wanted to go out in the second half and make them suffer and make their team suffer on the pitch, and I think we did that.\u201d", "description": "England players were furious that Bulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov allegedly told them \u201cthis is normal\u201d as they complained about the racist abuse that almost saw the Euro 2020 qualifying game abandoned.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Paul Hayward", "Jason Burt"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000213031096-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7P0TubxRUQnJB4ybUX7kN_w.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
