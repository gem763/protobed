Google's privacy team said earlier this month they discovered a two-year-long vulnerability in the company's software.\n\nApple quickly addressed the claim saying, in part, that Google created \"false impression of 'mass exploitation' to 'monitor the private activities of entire populations in real-time,' stoking fear among all iPhone users that their devices had been compromised.\"\n\n\"IOS security is unmatched because we take end-to-end responsibility for the security of our hardware and software,\" Apple announced on its website in response to consumer fears sparked by Google's claim. \"Our product security teams around the world are constantly iterating to introduce new protections and patch vulnerabilities as soon as they\u2019re found. We will never stop our tireless work to keep our users safe.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple COO Jeff Williams told Brett Larson earlier this week in an exclusive FOX Business interview that the tech giant is shelling out $250 million for further development of glass technology at Corning's factory in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Williams said the money will go toward research and development, new technologies, new innovations as well as retrofitting some advanced glass production in Corning.\n\nIOS 13 will offer both privacy features and an aesthetic \u201cdark mode\u201d for the screen \u2014 a feature already available on Macs.\n\nApple executives also claimed that iOS 13 will open apps faster and features a new version of the Face ID system will unlock your phone 30 percent faster. The software will also introduce more artificial intelligence to enable Apple\u2019s digital assistant, Siri, to speak more like a human and, if so assigned, automatically tackle even more tasks, such as reading incoming messages out loud. This move comes as Apple tries to catch up to the digital assistants made by Google and Amazon. Apple\u2019s improvements in artificial intelligence also hatched a new photo-management tool that picks out the best photos taken on a certain day or in an entire month or year.\n\nApple Maps will get the biggest makeover of any of the company\u2019s built-in apps. Beginning with iOS 13 the maps will include granular street and place data that Apple says it collected with street and aerial footage \u2014 tactics its largest mobile app rival Google has been using for years.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nFox's Brett Larson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Even if you don\u2019t plan on upgrading to a new Apple phone, expect a notification for iOS 13.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Apple-grab.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
