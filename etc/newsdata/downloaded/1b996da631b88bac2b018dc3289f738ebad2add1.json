But now we know that The Talk is actually a whole series of talks that don\u2019t centre solely around sex \u2014 there\u2019s also gender, consent, depression, bullying, masturbation and porn to cover.\n\nThat seems a little overwhelming, doesn\u2019t it? If you\u2019re not sure where to start\u2014or what topics you should even be covering\u2014this video age guide by Amaze will help.\n\nAmaze, which is sponsored by the non-profit organisation Advocates for Youth in collaboration with Answer and Youth Tech Health, has created a variety of resources for parents and kids to navigate an array of delicate topics. Its Age Guide is particularly helpful, categorising dozens of videos for ages 3+, 5+, 7+, 10+, 13+, and for caregivers. The topics include:\n\nThese types of conversations should begin early and happen on an ongoing basis as kids get older and have more questions. And, sure, they can feel awkward. Especially if a parent or caregiver never really talked to you about this stuff, it can be hard to know how to get the conversation rolling. That\u2019s why Amaze also created this \u201cHaving the Talks\u201d resource for starting appropriate and effective conversations with our older kids about topics like masturbation, puberty, porn and relationships.\n\nEach topic includes a video message for parents from a sex education expert, along with guides for general talking tips, conversation starters and key messaging scripts.\n\nBut don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself to get it \u201cright\u201d the first time. Remember that the goal is not to info-dump on kids; it\u2019s to open up a dialogue and create a dynamic in which they feel comfortable coming to you with questions.", "description": "We used to think of \u201cThe Talk\u201d as that one intensely awkward conversation where your parent sits you down to tell you about sex (you already know what it is) and to strongly suggest you not have it (maybe you already are).
