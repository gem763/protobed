We\u2019ve got some big receivers that can go up and get it.\u201d\n\nNewman, who started 13 of 14, also rushed for 29 yards. Sage Surratt finished with six catches for 45 yards and a score, and Kenneth Walker III had 125 yards on nine rushes, including a school-record 96-yard touchdown run with 13 minutes left in the fourth quarter, for the Demon Deacons (2-0).\n\n\u201cWe had a great day throwing the ball today,\u201d Washington said. \u201cJamie, he laid a lot of great balls out for us as a unit.\u201d\n\nWake outgained Rice 513 yards to 321.\n\nHouston\u2019s Tom Stewart completed 19 of 30 for 185 yards and a touchdown after replacing starter Wiley Green, who was carted off the field with 4:44 left in the first quarter. Brad Rozner finished with 103 yards on six catches for Rice (0-2).\n\nGreen was trying to dive head first into the end zone and being met by Royce Francis and Justin Strnad. The Rice training staff immediately ran across to the field to the far sideline to attend to Green, who was placed on a backboard. Green gave a thumbs up as he left the field. Green was 3 of 5 for 69 yards.\n\n\u201cThe reports we are getting right now are very positive,\u201d Rice coach Mike Bloomgren said. \u201cHe has movement and sensation in all of his limbs. We are waiting on a CT scan for confirmation. Things are trending the right way.\u201d\n\nAfter Rice tied it at 14, Wake scored the next 27 points, with Newman finding Washington for touchdowns of 25 and 59 sandwiched around two Nick Sciba field goals to give the Demon Deacons a 34-14 lead with five minutes left in the third.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s what we preach all the time: just finishing,\u201d Newman said. \u201cNo matter what the scoreboard is, we take everything play-by-play. Next play mentality. We just have to keep going every series.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nWake Forest: The Demon Deacons were able to keep pressure on Rice\u2019s quarterbacks throughout and finished with four sacks and eight tackles for loss and stopped Rice on the goal line to open the fourth quarter. The Wake offensive line gave Newman plenty of time to throw and keep drives alive. Wake Forest finished 7 of 14 on third downs.\n\n\u201cDefensively, we settled down in the second half and played much better,\u201d Clawson said. \u201cI thought the first half we were very unsettled and they did a good job of keeping us off balance.\u201d\n\nRice: The Owls were able to recover from an early 14-0 deficit with two quick scores in three minutes to tie the game with 1\u00bd minutes left in the first, but struggled offensively from there. The Owls had a tough time running the ball, finishing with 67 yards on 37 carries. Rice won the time of possession by 12\u00bd minutes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not quite there to play an ACC bowl team,\u201d Bloomgren said. \u201cI had hoped we could compete better than we did today. We will keep fighting. We\u2019re going to continue to try to respond in the right way when things go wrong, when adversity strikes, which it does in every football game.\u201d\n\nSLOWING DOWN THE OFFENSE\n\nA week after tying a school record by running 105 offensive plays against Utah State, Wake Forest finished with 62 plays on Friday night.\n\n\u201cWe knew that they slowed the tempo down on their end,\u201d Washington said. \u201cWe just know that we had to come out on our side of the ball and make the most out of every opportunity we could get.\u201d\n\nTARGETING\n\nRice starting cornerback Tyrae Thornton was ejected with 9:02 left in the first quarter after being called for targeting on a tackle of Surratt.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWake Forest: Hosts North Carolina in the third straight Friday night game to start the season.\n\nRice: Faces No. 9 Texas on Sept. 14 at NRG Stadium.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With Wake Forest's running game limited by Rice's defense early in Friday night's game, the Demon Deacons decided to take advantage of their size at wide receiver.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/wake_forest_rice_football_12395_c0-830-2819-2473_s1770x1032.jpg?b13a4fa553fcc32085618721d91c78c3b8626160", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
