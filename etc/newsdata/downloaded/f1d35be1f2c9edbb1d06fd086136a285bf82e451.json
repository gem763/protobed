As such, shareholders are recommended to vote against the transaction at this time,\" ISS said in a document seen by Reuters.\n\n\"Our valuation analysis suggests a fair value range of 4.6 - 5.2 billion Swiss francs (enterprise value) for UPC on a standalone basis if its performance were in line with that of peer cable operators,\" ISS said, adding that operational difficulties including declining revenues made the 6.3 billion consideration further appear excessive.\n\nThe proxy adviser said it saw \"seemingly limited downside risk for Sunrise shares in rejecting the deal\", but shareholders would have to bear the cost of the break-up fee payable in that case.\n\nSunrise couldn't immediately be reached for a comment. ISS said the document would be published to media on Friday.
