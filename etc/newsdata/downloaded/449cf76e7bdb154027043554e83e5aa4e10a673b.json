An appeal in that case remains pending and would be expected to be dealt with the same way as the Ohio dispute.\n\nThe June high court ruling did allow partisan gerrymandering to be challenged in lawsuits based on violations of a state constitution. On Sept. 3, a state court in North Carolina struck down the Republican-drawn state legislative electoral map as an unlawful example of partisan gerrymandering under the state constitution.\n\nIn partisan gerrymandering, one political party draws legislative districts to marginalize voters who tend to support the other party. The lines are typically redrawn once a decade after the U.S. census, and in many states the party in power controls the decision-making.\n\nIncluded in the 2012 Ohio electoral map drawn by Republicans at issue in the case was the \"Snake on the Lake,\" which the judges called \"a bizarre, elongated sliver of a district that severed numerous counties,\" referring to the state's 9th district that runs along Lake Erie. The electoral map consistently led to a lopsided advantage for Republicans in U.S. House races.\n\nThe League of Women Voters and the American Civil Liberties Union sued to challenge the legality of the map.", "description": "U.S. Supreme Court tosses challenge to Republican-drawn Ohio congressional maps", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF960YT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
