It\u2019s what producers and consumers alike are hoping for,\u201d Liu said in a speech that was interpreted by many as preparing the public for the confirmation of a \u201cphase-1\u201d deal to de-escalate the dispute.\n\nMarkets were also sustained by hopes that Prime Minister Boris Johnson can force his EU withdrawal bill through parliament, having backed away from forcing a vote on it on Saturday. Getting the bill passed would end the short-term uncertainty over Britain\u2019s formal departure from the bloc but would still leave large, longer-term questions over the U.K.\u2019s future access to the EU\u2019s single market unanswered.\n\nBy 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark was up 0.4% at 393.24, just a whisker below the 17-month high that it hit last week. The U.K. was up less than 0.1%, thanks to sterling strength, while the German was up 0.6% and the Italian was up 0.4%.\n\nMarkets are benefiting from some recent upgrades out of Wall Street. JPMorgan (NYSE: ) turning more bullish on the region last week and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) analysts reportedly upgrading European banks to overweight at the weekend.\n\nBank stocks were among the biggest gainers in early trading, led by Commerzbank (DE: ) with a 3.9% gain and Danske Bank , up 3.0%. Six of the biggest seven gainers in the were also banks, Santander (MC: ) also catching the eye with a plan to launch a nationwide online deposit-taking platform in the U.S., a step that would greatly increase its presence in that market.\n\nMore than anything, Morgan Stanley\u2019s call is a valuation-based play on a bombed-out sector. Commerzbank (DE: ) trades at only one-quarter of the book value of its assets, while the sector as a whole trades at 0.64 times book, according to data compiled by Investing.com. Few trade at more than 11 times this year\u2019s expected earnings, while banks such as Intesa Sanpaolo (MI: ), ABN AMRO (AS: ), Natixis (PA: ) and Societe Generale (PA: ) offer dividends of over 8%. Nordea (HE: ) and Danske Bank (CSE: ) offer even higher yields of over 10%, albeit against a background of looming changes to regulation that may force them to cut their payouts.", "description": "StockBeat: Europe Markets Rise as Bombed-Out Bank Stocks Rebound", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC140ZQ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
