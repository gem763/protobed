They say they were duped into thinking they were playing a prank for a hidden-camera show.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nSiti Aisyah, from Indonesia, appeared in court Tuesday accused of poisoning Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un\n\nCo-accused Doan Thi Huong was also in court in Kuala Lumur for a brief hearing. The women wore bullet-proof vests and were guarded by armed police\n\nYusron Ambary, counsellor at the Indonesian Embassy, read a letter that Aisyah wrote to reporters outside the courtroom.\n\nShe said: 'I am in good health. Just pray. Don't think about me too much. Keep healthy and pray at night. I have a lot of people helping me.\n\nThe pair are accused of smearing deadly VX nerve agent on Jong-nam's face. They say they thought they were taking part in a hidden-camera show\n\n'The embassy officials always come to see me, my lawyers also. Don't worry.\n\n'Pray for me so that the case will be over soon and I can go back home. Send my love to my son Rio.'\n\nArmed escorts accompanied the women, who smiled at their embassy representatives as they were brought to the dock.\n\nThe case was then officially transferred to the High Court, because the lower court does not have the authority to try murder cases.\n\nProsecutor Iskandar Ahmad said the date for their first appearance in the High Court would usually be within a month.\n\nThe suspects would then enter pleas and the trial would have to start within 90 days, Iskandar said.\n\nPolice have said four North Korean suspects fled Malaysia the day of the attack. Defense lawyers fear the women will be used as scapegoats in their absence.\n\nAisyah (left) wrote to her family from jail telling them 'pray for me that the case will be over soon' but also asking 'don't think about me too much' (right, Huong enters the court)\n\nThere was a heavy police presence around the trial, with armed guards standing watch outside the courtroom during the women's brief appearance\n\nAlthough Malaysia never directly accused North Korea of carrying out the attack, speculation is rampant that Pyongyang orchestrated a hit on a long-exiled member of its ruling elite.\n\nAlthough Kim, who was estranged from his family, was not an obvious political threat, he may have been seen as a potential rival in the country's dynastic dictatorship.\n\nNorth Korea has denounced such speculation.\n\nCCTV appears to show (circled in red) a man purported to be Kim Jong Nam being accosted by a woman in a white shirt at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia on February 13.
