I don\u2019t think I own any of their CDs. I\u2019m not a huge fan. But, I mean, cool, I guess.\u201d\n\nWhen the vintage clip ended, Biel said to Fallon, \u201cI am so screwed now.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take Timberlake long to get payback. He shared a photo of his wife\u2019s Halloween costume on Instagram and wrote: \u201cThis is what happens when your wife admits on TV that she doesn\u2019t know any NSYNC songs.\u201d\n\nBiel and Timberlake were just two of the big name stars that attended the Casamigos Halloween party on the weekend along with Cindy Crawford, Laverne Cox, Nina Dobrev, Ellen Pompeo, Gerard Butler and Paris Hilton.\n\nThere were several other A-list Halloween parties on the weekend.
