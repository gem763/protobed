Nixon loomed over Washington and the country, Maryland Rep. Lawrence J. Hogan \u2014 a Republican \u2014 purchased airtime on television networks across his state.\n\nAt age 45, the ex-FBI agent had a promising political career ahead. He was running for governor. His populist style of politics had some mentioning even higher offices.\n\nStaring into the cameras that evening, Hogan knew he was gambling with his political future.\n\nHe didn\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cI want with all my heart,\u201d Hogan said, \u201cto be able to say to you now that the president of the United States is innocent of wrongdoing, that he has not committed an impeachable offense, but I cannot say that.\u201d\n\nSo he said this: \u201cRichard M. Nixon has, beyond a reasonable doubt, committed impeachable offenses.\u201d\n\nHogan was voting for impeachment.\n\nWith the announcement, Hogan became the first Republican on the House Judiciary Committee to side with the Democrats. He'd ultimately become the only GOP member to vote for all three articles of impeachment leveled at Nixon.\n\n[Deep Throat\u2019s identity was a mystery for decades because no one believed this woman]\n\nOn Friday, another Republican congressman, Mark Amodei, the chairman of President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign in Nevada, suggested he supported a House impeachment inquiry, though he told local reporters that he didn\u2019t know whether he\u2019d actually vote for impeachment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of oversight, so let\u2019s let the committees get to work and see where it goes,\u201d he said. But by Saturday, Amodei was denying he is the first Republican lawmaker to back an inquiry.\n\nIn 1974, there were many beginnings-of-the-end for Nixon, but Hogan\u2019s decision was an important one. He had frequently sided with Nixon on issues before the committee. And Nixon was counting on him as a \u201cno\u201d vote.\n\nIt was yet another disaster for Nixon, one he recounted decades later in his memoirs.\n\n\u201cThe fact was that he had dealt us a very bad blow,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHogan, whose district was primarily Prince George\u2019s County, was immediately accused of playing politics. Nixon\u2019s staff and their Republican allies said Hogan was just trying raise his profile across Maryland in the governor\u2019s race.\n\nAnd at first, his vote did just that.\n\nTouring parts of Western Maryland, Hogan\u2019s face was instantly recognizable as he visited neighborhoods shaking hands.\n\n\u201cMost of those who said they recognized Hogan from his television appearances during the Judiciary Committee proceedings and afterwards said they have never heard of the Prince George\u2019s County congressman before impeachment,\u201d The Post reported.\n\n[That time Nixon released doctored transcripts during Watergate]\n\nBut the governor\u2019s race was still in the primaries. Hogan\u2019s opponent, Louise Gore, used his impeachment support as a dagger, saying that the lawmaker had turned the proceedings into a \u201ctelevision circus.\u201d\n\nNixon had resigned. But Hogan lost.\n\n\u201cIronically,\u201d The Post reported, \u201chis campaign workers say that moment in the national spotlight may have hurt Hogan.\u201d On election night, a Hogan campaign worker told The Post that turning on Nixon was \u201cheresy\u201d to the \u201cdedicated party workers\u201d across the state.\n\n\u201cI lost a lot of friends, supporters and contributions,\u201d Hogan said in a 2015 WYPR radio interview. \u201cMany Republicans were very unforgiving at that time.\u201d\n\nThough he later won election as Prince George\u2019s County executive, Hogan lost a tough fight to Democrat Paul S. Sarbanes for the U.S. Senate in 1982.\n\n\n\nA childhood photo in Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan's office shows him with his father, Lawrence Hogan. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Republican\u2019s impeachment vote derailed his political career but not his hopes of one day seeing a Hogan in the State House. His son, Lawrence J. Hogan Jr., became governor of Maryland in 2015. Two years later, the elder Hogan died at age 88.\n\nGov. Hogan \u2014 an occasional critic of President Trump \u2014 has spoken passionately about his father\u2019s legacy in taking a stand against a president from the same party.\n\nAt his second inauguration earlier this year, Hogan said his father\u2019s decision had \u201ccost him dearly.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it earned him something more valuable,\u201d the governor added. \u201cA quiet conscience and an honored place in history.\u201d\n\nThe younger Hogan hasn\u2019t said whether he supports impeaching Trump. But he didn\u2019t vote for him in 2016. He opted to write-in a different Republican: his father.\n\nRead more Retropolis\n\nThe forgotten security guard who discovered the Watergate break-in\n\nA clambake, slurs and phone sex: The long, strange history of presidential calls\n\nThe first effort to impeach a president was led by his own party\n\nThe police officer who arrested a president", "description": "In 1974, Rep.
