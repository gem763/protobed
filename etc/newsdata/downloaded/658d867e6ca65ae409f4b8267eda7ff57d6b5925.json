They hammered the point home Tuesday after the White House blockage.\n\n\u201cThe failure to produce this witness \u2026 we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress,\u201d House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff told reporters.\n\nSondland was one of a handful of US diplomats on a text message chain, provided to Democrats leading the probe, that go to the heart of the focus of the investigation.\n\nThe messages between the diplomats, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and a Ukrainian presidential aide show that they helped coordinate administration efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Trump\u2019s political rivals as it sought aid and access.\n\nIn their messages, top US diplomats discussed leveraging a potential summit between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s newly inaugurated President Volodymyr Zelensky on a pledge to investigate 2016 election interference and a company that employed the son of Joe Biden, the frontrunner in the Democrat race to challenge Trump in 2020.\n\nLuskin said Sondland \u2014 a wealthy hotel investor and major donor to Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 had traveled from Brussels to Washington and was prepared to testify.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland believes strongly that he acted at all times in the best interests of the United States, and he stands ready to answer the Committee\u2019s questions fully and truthfully.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 The White House on Tuesday blocked a top US diplomat from speaking to Congress as part of the impeachment investigation of Donald", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/5f989f_us-president-donald-trump-has-blocked-key-diplomat-testifying-congressional-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
