I have won six Arcs so, to me, getting another one will not make a difference. It's more for her and for the sport. If she does create history she will be immortal.\n\nDettori celebrates with Enable after winning the Qatar Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe last year\n\n'It's about a fitting finale for Enable. She has been a star and nobody will forget her and her races like her thrilling victory over Crystal Ocean in the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in July.\n\n'I cried when she won the Yorkshire Oaks at York in August and I will probably cry again. She has been part of my life for three years. She has taken me to places that no other horse has taken me.\n\n'Of course, I love her. That means there will be sadness too. I will be riding her in the most important race of her career and I will also be letting her go. For me it will be sad day. A great day, but a sad day.'\n\nDettori concedes he has been thinking about Enable's Arc bid every day since she won the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July on her comeback.\n\nHe has been taking no risks ahead of his 31st Arc and hasn't had a ride since last Saturday. Since being unplaced on Roushayd in Tony Bin's 1988 Arc, the only time he has missed the race was when he was supposed to ride 2013 winner Treve but broke his ankle.\n\nDespite the experience he admits the pressure has also been building.\n\nDettori riding Enable before exercising on the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket in September\n\nThe rider said: 'The nerves kick in on Friday. Then I'm not a nice person to be around. I am obnoxious and nothing is right. My family run away and disappear.\n\n'No horse has done what Enable has done. We are trying to scale a mountain that has never been scaled before.\n\n'The Arc is no gimme. There are the best horses in Europe taking you on. Everything has to go right and Enable has to perform at her best and I have to make sure that I don't make a balls-up of it. Apart from that it is easy!'\n\nThe Arc is certainly no gimme but there are reasons beyond Enable's record of 14 wins, 10 of them at Group One level and \u00a39,382,243 in prize money that make her the overwhelming favourite.\n\nMost importantly, her run-in to the race has been in complete contrast to 12 months ago when, below her best after being beset by injury and illness, Enable clung on for victory from fast-finishing Sea of Class.\n\nThe latter's sad death after being struck down by cancer means one of the biggest obstacles to Enable is removed. So is the threat of King George runner-up Crystal Ocean, hastened to retirement by injury.\n\nDettori celebrates in the parade ring after winning the William Hill St Leger Stakes last month\n\nThe fact that only 11 rivals take her on \u2013 there were 18 last year and 17 when she beat Cloth of Stars in 2017 \u2014 also mean the randomness of disruptive race events is reduced.\n\nEnable has met and beaten old rivals Magical and Waldgeist and the Japanese threat while numerically strong lacks the quality of previous challenges. That leaves three rivals Enable has never faced who look her biggest dangers \u2014 Ghaiyyath and the three-year-old colts Japan and Sottsass.\n\nFrench Derby winner Sottsass, who would be the first home-trained winner since Treve in 2014, looks the most likely party pooper but Dettori feels his No 1 danger is Japan, who has got better with every run and landed York's International Stakes on his last run. But it has hardly been a vintage year for the Classic crop and we know that horses like Enable come in limited editions.\n\nWhen Treve tried to land her third Arc in 2015, it was Dettori who blocked her path on Golden Horn.\n\nThis time the stage is set for him and Enable to make history.
