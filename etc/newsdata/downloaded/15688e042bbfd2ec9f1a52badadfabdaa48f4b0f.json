The photo has been printed in history books, displayed in museums, and even won a Pulitzer Prize. But for over 70 years, one of the figures appears to have been misidentified.\n\nThree historians established that for seven decades, Cpl Harold \u201cPie\u201d Keller has wrongly been identified as Pfc Rene Gagnon in the 23 February 1945 photo.\n\nThe historians Stephen Foley, Dustin Spence and Brent Westemeyer used archival film footage and other photos taken at Iwo Jima to establish the Keller\u2019s identity. Their reveal comes only three years after historians discovered another marine in the photo was misidentified.\n\nKeller\u2019s identity was confirmed by a marines investigative board and investigators from the FBI\u2019s digital evidence laboratory.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the marines said: \u201cRegardless of who was in the photograph, each and every Marine who set foot on Iwo Jima, or supported the effort from the sea and air around the island is, and always will be, a part of our Corps\u2019 cherished history. In the words of General David H Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps, \u2018they are all heroes\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe family of Keller, who died of a heart attack in 1979, is grateful for the correction.\n\n\u201cNow we know he\u2019s in that photo, too,\u201d Keller\u2019s daughter told NBC News. \u201cWhen I would ask him about the photo on our wall, he would say something like, \u2018That group raised a flag.\u2019 He just never spoke much about this when we were growing up.\u201d\n\nThe facts around the Pulitzer prize-winning photo have continually been rewritten. In 1946, the marines conducted an inquiry into the identities of the troops after a slew of claims of mistaken identities came pouring in.", "description": "US%20marine%20in%20classic%20Iwo%20Jima%20photo%20was%20wrongly%20identified%2C%20historians%20find%20%7C%20US%20military%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Wheeler"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
