On just 10 carries, Moss also recorded his 13th 100-yard rushing performance with 10:05 still left in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cFinally, the coaches had been preaching it all week. They were dying and begging to have us get a good start, so it felt good. Hopefully, we can carry that forward,\u201d Moss said.\n\nHuntley completed 15 of 19 passes before leaving in the third quarter as Utah moved to 3-0 for the fifth time in the last six seasons.\n\nThrough the first two games, Utah didn\u2019t throw many long passes, but Huntley aired it out on his third pass - an 82-yard TD strike to Bryan Thompson that traveled 55 yards in the air.\n\nOn Utah\u2019s next possession, Huntley connected on a 60-yard pass to Brant Kuithe for another score.\n\nThompson, who has battled injuries in his career, had 105 yards receiving and two touchdowns as the Utes went deep a few times.\n\n\u201cI think it means a lot to Tyler and Zack, too. Teams can\u2019t just focus on the run if we can stretch the field,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nThe lone first-half highlight for the Bengals (1-1) was stopping the Utes on fourth down at the 1 when Huntley mishandled the snap on a sneak attempt.\n\nUtah was the only team in the FBS that had yet to commit a turnover or allow a sack this season until Britain Covey lost a fumble with 9:46 to play.\n\nIdaho State only managed 116 yards in the game and the Utah defense was proud of the shutout.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you shoot for every game - zero points. If you don\u2019t score, you don\u2019t win,\u201d said linebacker Devin Lloyd, who had nine tackles including 3.5 for a loss.\n\nThe Utes have won all eight games they\u2019ve played against the Bengals and the closest game was 24-0 in 1944.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe Utes scored on their first four possessions and drove to the 1-yard-line on their fifth drive while holding the Bengals to 57 yards in the first half while most starters were still in the game. Considering the FCS competition, the gaudy statistics and lopsided score may not be enough to move the Utes up or even hold steady.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIdaho State: The Bengals looked overmatched from the start and didn\u2019t cross mid-field until the second half. Idaho State played both Matt Struck and Gunnar Amos but neither had much time to throw and often missed their targets.\n\nUtah: The offense showed a few new formations and plays and completed a few downfield passes to gain a comfortable lead that allowed them to sit Moss midway through the second quarter. Other than 11 penalties and a fourth-quarter lost fumble, the Utes achieved their goal of playing clean and getting a host of second- and third-team players some experience. The defense bolstered its suffocating reputation.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIdaho visits Northern Iowa next Saturday.\n\nThe Utes open Pac-12 play at No. 24 Southern Cal on Friday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tyler Huntley threw for 282 yards and three touchdowns and Zach Moss ran for 106 yards and another score in No. 11 Utah's 31-0 victory over Idaho State on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matthew Coles"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/idaho_st_utah_football_90311_c0-226-5400-3374_s1770x1032.jpg?cb5c7867563b2abf97a00a102051a13af94a4d48", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
