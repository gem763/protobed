Ms. Sanders and a person close to Mr. Trump\u2019s son said on Sunday that they did not see the video at the conference.\n\nThe video, which includes the logo for Mr. Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign, comprises a series of internet memes. The most violent clip shows Mr. Trump\u2019s head superimposed on the body of a man opening fire inside the \u201cChurch of Fake News\u201d on parishioners who have the faces of his critics or the logos of media organizations superimposed on their bodies. It appears to be an edited scene of a church massacre from the 2014 dark comedy film \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service.\u201d\n\nThe disclosure that the video was played shows how Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-media language has influenced his supporters and bled into their own propaganda. Mr. Trump has made attacks on the news media a mainstay of his presidency, and he tweeted a similar \u2014 but far less violent video \u2014 in 2017. In recent weeks as he has confronted impeachment proceedings, he has ramped up his attacks on the news media, repeatedly calling it the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d", "description": "The video was shown at a conference attended by Donald Trump Jr. and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
