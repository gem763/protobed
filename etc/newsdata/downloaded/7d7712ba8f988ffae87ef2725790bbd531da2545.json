Gerrit Cole, who went 20-5 in the regular season, starts for Houston, with the Series tied 2-2.\n\nScherzer said the pain started a few days ago and he thought trainers would be able to help him pitch through it.\n\n\u201cWhen I woke up this morning it was completely locked up,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a muscle spasm. The nerve that\u2019s in the neck is all jammed up.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to pitch as soon as he tried to get up.\n\n\u201cI had to fall out of bed and pick myself up with my left arm,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even dress myself. I had to have my wife help me.\u201d\n\nScherzer said he could not lift his arm and had a cortisone shot to alleviate the pain caused by the nerve between the C5 and C6 vertebrae. He had a bandage on the back on his neck, slightly to the right.\n\nHe hopes to be available for a Game 7 on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take at least 48 hours for this to kick in,\u201d he said.\n\nScherzer beat Cole in Tuesday\u2019s opener, and Martinez said he felt the spasm near his neck and trapezius muscle on his right side Saturday.\n\n\u201cMax, obviously he pitched with a broken nose,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWhen he comes in and says he\u2019s hurt this bad, he\u2019s hurt.\u201d\n\nRoss has pitched just once in the postseason, throwing 19 pitches over two scoreless innings in Washington\u2019s 4-1 loss in Game 3 on Friday night.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got good stuff, and he got his feet wet the other night, so that\u2019ll help him,\u201d Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said. \u201cTo make an emergency start in Game 5 of the World Series against the Houston Astros, he\u2019ll have to control his emotions \u2026 and just follow the game plan and see what happens.\u201d\n\nA 26-year-old right-hander, Ross was 4-4 with a 5.48 ERA in 27 appearances, including 4-2 with a 3.02 ERA in nine starts.\n\nBefore Friday he last pitched Sept. 29, starting against Cleveland on the final day of the regular season and getting the win by allowing one run and four hits in six innings while throwing 78 pitches.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to let him go as much as he can go,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nGame 6 starter Stephen Strasburg threw a bullpen session on Saturday and was not an option to face the Astros on three days\u2019 rest.\n\n\u201cI think everybody is dealing with the effects of a long season,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cSo you really just kind of focus on what you can control. Sometimes things are out of your control.\u201d\n\nRizzo and Martinez said Scherzer\u2019s injury was not related to the back problems that caused the 35-year-old right-hander to go on the injured list this summer and limited the pitcher to an 11-7 record with a 2.92 ERA in 27 starts. A three-time Cy Young Award winner, Scherzer had bursitis in his right scapula and a strained rhomboid muscle in the right side of his upper back.\n\n\u201cHe just locked up,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe was in a bad place. Like I said, he\u2019s really upset about it. I\u2019ve never seen \u2014 believe me, I\u2019ve never seen Max this quiet.\u201d\n\nScherzer said Saturday his back was fine but that he planned to adjust his offseason training after this year\u2019s injuries.\n\nIn the playoffs, Scherzer is 3-0 with a 2.16 ERA in five appearances, four starts. He labored through five innings in Game 1 of the World Series, allowing two runs and throwing 112 pitches, to get the win.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t stunned,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cI was surprised that it worsened overnight. Like a lot of neck or back things, it got worse overnight.\u201d\n\nAstros manager AJ Hinch learned of the switch when third baseman Alex Bregman saw a notification on his phone and asked whether it was true.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to high five. We\u2019re not going to have that moment where we feel like we have some sort of advantage,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cWe need to go find a way to beat Joe Ross now.\u201d\n\nHouston Game 6 starter Justin Verlander remembered Scherzer\u2019s tenacity from their time together on the Detroit Tigers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be pretty bad,\u201d Verlander said. \u201cHe was a competitor, always wanted to take the ball.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Stephen Whyno contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Nationals pitcher Max Scherzer was scratched from his scheduled start in Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday night because of spasms", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/27/ca555d_world-series-nationals-astros-baseball-62722-washington-nationals-starting-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
