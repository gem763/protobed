By contrast the Scottish appeal court on Wednesday ruled that the prime minister acted illegally in proroguing parliament in order to stifle debate in the Commons.\n\nDelivering the judgment, McCloskey said: \u201cVirtually all of the assembled evidence belongs to the world of politics, both national and supra-national.\n\n\u201cWithin the world of politics, the well-recognised phenomena of claim and counter-claim, assertion and counter-assertion, allegation and denial, blow and counter-blow, alteration and modification of government policy, public statements, unpublished deliberations, posturing, strategy and tactics are the very essence of what is both countenanced and permitted in a democratic society.\u201d\n\nThe judge did not deal directly with prorogation since he said it had been been the \u201ccentrepiece\u201d of the English and Scottish cases.\n\nThe Belfast hearing, involving three cases, turned on different legal issues to those heard in London and Edinburgh.\n\nLawyers for the applicants in Belfast argued that by creating a hard border on the island of Ireland, a no-deal Brexit on 31 Octoberwould undermine the Good Friday agreement and other agreements that underpin cross-border cooperation between the UK and Ireland.\n\nOne of the applicants was a high-profile victims\u2019 campaigner, Raymond McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in 1997.\n\nAnother victims\u2019 campaigner, Jamie Waring, brought a case. He was represented by the Belfast-based civil rights organisation the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ).\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s appeal court will hear appeals against the decision on Friday. The Northern Ireland cases will eventually reach the supreme court in London next week when claims from London, Edinburgh and Belfast will be joined together in a three-day hearing.", "description": "Judge says claims hard border would damage peace process are political, not legal, issues", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d9752dfaf35c34cefe7247bc61b66247edefcbd/0_60_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f195ffa181bb0354fd32ec7074f8ca07", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
