Positive payroll is not consistent with a recession.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a goldilocks report. It\u2019s not strong enough to move the Federal reserve away from cutting rates at the end of October but it\u2019s not weak enough to make you concerned about the labor market or the consumer.\u201d\n\nSHAUN OSBORNE, CHIEF FX STRATEGIST, SCOTIABANK, TORONTO:\n\n\u201cThe number came just shy of expectations, but given that market expectations have shifted after the ADP and ISM numbers, people were bracing for something worse than this. So this is in the ballpark of what is acceptable. Wage growth is a bit soft, but unemployment dropped. In a broad sense, this was not that bad. It probably gives the dollar a bit of breathing room after a bit of a rough ride the last three or four days.\u201d\n\nJOSEPH SROKA, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, NOVAPOINT, ATLANTA\n\n\u201cThe number came up light relative to consensus, but not too bad on the private data. But the culmination of the weak ISM data and the payrolls report is increasing the odds in investors mindset that the Fed has more incentive to consider another interest rate reduction at the next meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe economy has been going through a low level of deceleration over the last couple of months and when you take them in aggregate some is trade-related and some is time-related, meaning you can\u2019t grow infinitely. The Fed\u2019s been proactive on adjusting interest rates before we saw the data like this month\u2019s ISM. So maybe the issue that some modest rate adjustment from the Fed is enough to keep the economy from a deeper decline and extend expansion, albeit at a slower pace.\u201d\n\nSAMEER SAMANA, SENIOR GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE, ST. LOUIS\n\n\u201cHeadline job growth, private payrolls, and manufacturing payrolls, and wage growth all came in weaker than expected and suggests some softening in the labor market.\n\n\u201cThis data probably reinforces the case that the U.S. is now beginning to feel the effects of the ongoing global slowdown and probably strengthens the case for additional rate cuts, if the Fed chooses to go down that path.\u201d\n\nTOM PORCELLI, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cIf people were genuinely on the edge of the conversation about whether or not we\u2019re slipping into recession or not, this is the kind of number that should force them to take a step back from that view. I never necessarily thought that people should be holding that view, but I\u2019m simply highlighting a market reality. I think that there was, from the market perspective, a real risk that we were slipping into recession. This is not a recessionary kind of number. This was a perfectly sound report in most ways, not in every way. The one thing that I don\u2019t like is that average hourly earnings were flat. But nevertheless, the unemployment rate improved again, we\u2019re 3.5% on the unemployment report. This is not a dynamic that happens with great regularity in the United States, historically speaking. The labor backdrop is actually in really good shape, despite a lot of the noise that we continue to hear about these fears. This report throws a lot of cold water on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the Fed is locked going in October, almost no outcome was going to change that. Whether the number was worse than expected or even quite a bit better than expected, I think the Fed was going to go. The doves on the committee are obviously in control because they are the voters right now.\n\nKATHY JONES, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, SCHWAB CENTER FOR FINANCIAL RESEARCH, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cI think that the overall picture confirms the gentle slowdown in the economy that is already priced into the bond market. But the lack of wage gain, I think, is a bit of a surprise. You would think that given the low level of the unemployment rate, wages would be ticking up, but actually average hourly earnings were down a bit. That could be a fluke, but they did peak in February\u2026That raises a lot of questions \u2013 what is the composition of jobs that are being added? Is it that we\u2019re pulling in a lot of folks who have been at the margins and therefore are more low-wage jobs being added?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll in all, it\u2019s not probably a big mover for the bond market, but it does leave the likelihood of a Fed rate cut on the table \u2013 perhaps in October, perhaps they\u2019ll decide upon it in December and get more data.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty consistent with what we saw with the PMIs, the ISMs\u2026 The ISM was pretty soft. The drop in the manufacturing payrolls was a confirmation of softness in there. We saw a bit of a drop in mining as well, which is not surprising. Construction, soft. Overall a soft report, but that was anticipated.\u201d\n\nJOHN VELIS, GLOBAL MACRO STRATEGIST, BNY MELLON, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cGoing into it and considering what we saw with the two ISM surveys, it could have been a lot worse. It\u2019s probably just right for the market and not as dire as many people expected. It doesn\u2019t mean that the economy and the jobs market are falling off a cliff. On the other hand, it\u2019s not strong enough that it\u2019s going to take out this additional Fed easing that has been priced into the curve the last few days.\u201d\n\nDOUG DUNCAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FANNIE MAE, WASHINGTON\n\n\u201cThe revisions being up is a positive because typically when the employment market is slowing the revisions of prior months are down, and that has been the case for about five months. So, the fact that the revisions are up this time suggest that there\u2019s not a precipitous slowing in unemployment. The fact that wage rates are holding is good news, it\u2019s support for the consumer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a warning of a significant slowdown in the economy from these data. Our view is that in order to maintain the level of unemployment stable we need to add somewhere between 100,000 and 120,000 jobs a month, so this certainly fits that. It does not suggest a significant slowing in activity at this point.\n\n\u201cI would be surprised if there was a significant reaction (from the market) in either direction. What it does do is highlight the differences of opinion on the Fed board about whether the economy is slowing precipitously or not and you had multiple dissents from the last rate cut, that doesn\u2019t help clarify for them whether their disagreements are merited or not.\u201d\n\nJJ KINAHAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO\n\n\u201cThere is a lot to like, especially given the revisions that happened. Retail losing as many jobs as it did again, I don\u2019t think it is a big surprise. We continue to see that trend, everyone is trying to figure it out, so to speak, and again the area they lost them in being primarily in clothing.\n\n\u201cManufacturing may be a little bit concerning, down 2,000 jobs not a huge thing overall. You have to remember this did not include the GM strike because of timing. So that one will show up in the next report, but it is great that we got a 45,000 revision higher between July and August and that is one of the things people really liked about this. The two areas that have been unbelievable being healthcare and business to business services are just stud sectors. Every single month those two sectors show up and we just continue to see that. The other thing that was important was transportation and warehousing, so again, areas that take goods from one place to another, up 16,000 jobs. Most of this was a real positive for the economy despite some of the other numbers we are seeing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had such a string of bad news, that anything that shows the economy is doing better than perhaps people have been talking about is well received. I don\u2019t think it clarifies the picture any which way (for the Fed). It is one more piece of gray thrown into the picture.\u201d", "description": "U.S. job growth increased moderately in September, with the unemployment rate dropping to near a 50-year low of 3.5%, which could assuage financial market concerns that the slowing economy was on the brink of a recession amid lingering trade tensions.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
