Loeb, founder of Third Point LLC, participates in a panel discussion during the Skybridge Alternatives (SALT) Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada May 9, 2012. REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo\n\nBOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb said on Thursday his hedge fund owns a $700 million stake in Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica SA and is urging the company to \u201caccelerate leadership transitions\u201d.\n\nLoeb also said he was still speaking with Sony and remained committed to creating value at the Japanese company even after management largely ignored his proposals for ways to streamline the company\u2019s portfolio.\n\nLoeb wrote a letter to investors seen by Reuters that he and Third Point executives had met with many EssilorLuxottica executives and expect the company to increase earnings and free cash flow at mid-teens CAGR (compound annual growth rate) for several years.\n\n\u201cCombined with the GrandVision acquisition, we expect EL to earn over 8 euros of EPS in 2023, nearly doubling the figure from 2019,\u201d the letter said.\n\nLoeb, whose firm oversees $14.5 billion and is widely watched for its activist investments, also said that he is disappointed with Sony\u2019s decision to stick with the \u201cstatus quo\u201d after Third Point presented a list of ways to unlock value.\n\n\u201cWhile we did not expect that all our requests, such as the separation of the image sensor business, would be addressed immediately, we did expect that the Company would make some\n\nrecommendations to address the structural impediments to long-term value creation for Sony\u2019s shareholders,\u201d he wrote in the letter.\n\nStill he says that he is committed to \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d with the company and said that discussions are ongoing. He calls Sony one of the \u201cmost undervalued large capitalization stocks in the world\u201d and noted that it has contributed to the firm\u2019s 12.7% return this year.", "description": "Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb said on Thursday his hedge fund owns a $700 million stake in Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica SA and is urging the company to \"accelerate leadership transitions\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444508339&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N17B", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
