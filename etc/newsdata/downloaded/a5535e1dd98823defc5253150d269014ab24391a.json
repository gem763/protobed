Firms classifying and measuring their financial assets and liabilities under IFRS 9, a new rule that also took effect for reporting periods starting on or after Jan. 1, 2018, were told by the FRC to provide more detail on credit risks. Companies applying IAS 36, a standard on how to impair assets, could provide more information around their judgments and key assumptions, the FRC said. Thursday\u2019s findings come amid growing concerns about the application of key accounting standards by British companies and the audit of financial statements by large audit firms. Regulators and lawmakers have suggested various changes to the rules governing the U.K. accounting and audit industry, but the government has yet to respond to these proposals. As part of the changes, the FRC\u2019s former leadership team consisting of Chairman Win Bischoff and Chief Executive Stephen Haddrill has stepped down. They were replaced Tuesday by Chairman Simon Dingemans, the former finance chief of pharmaceuticals company GlaxoSmithKline PLC, and Chief Executive Jon Thompson, who previously ran the U.K.\u2019s tax office. The FRC will become part of a new regulatory body called the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority.
