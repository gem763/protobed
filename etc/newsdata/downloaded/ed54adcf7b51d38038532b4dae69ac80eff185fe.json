When your hands are dry and chapped, doing simple chores like washing the dishes can be painful and irritating. Unfortunately, you can go through dozens of products before you find the right cream to help heal and prevent chapped hands. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve done the work for you.\n\nI\u2019m no stranger to dry, chapped hands. I have horses at home, which means I\u2019m outside at least four or five times each day, even in the harshest of winter weather. I also wash my hands frequently, which only makes the problem worse. Because of my dry skin, I\u2019ve accumulated a significant collection of lotions and hand creams. Many of them didn\u2019t solve the problem \u2013 but some of them did.\n\nThe products in this guide are intended for anyone who deals with dry skin in the winter or even year-round. I\u2019ve tested many of them and tried to select products that aren\u2019t heavily scented, greasy, or that require frequent applications throughout the day.\n\nTo get the best results from these products, apply them according to the brand\u2019s directions. Using these products after washing your hands or showering can get you positive results, and try to make a habit of using your lotion or hand cream before bed for overnight moisturizing.\n\nHere are the best hand creams for dry, chapped hands:\n\nUpdated on 10/22/19 by Remi Rosmarin: Updated formatting, links, and prices.\n\nThe best hand cream overall\n\nsource O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s Company\n\nO\u2019Keeffe\u2019s Working Hands Hand Cream offers healing and protective properties in a greaseless formula.\n\nFor valuable healing paired with protective properties, you can\u2019t go wrong with O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s Working Hands Hand Cream. This hand cream is designed to heal, relieve, and repair extremely dry, cracked hands.\n\nThis cream contains paraffin, which helps to establish a barrier that protects your skin from losing water. At the same time, glycerin draws moisture to your skin in order to accelerate the hydration process. The cream is greaseless, yet effectively reduces the rate of evaporation on your hands, helping to restore your hands\u2019 moisture balance while healing your cracked, irritated skin.\n\nAvailable in both a jar and in a tube, this hand cream is scentless, so you can put it on before leaving the house and no one will know. It\u2019s recommended that you use it multiple times a day, which is easy to do because the cream absorbs so easily into your hands.\n\nThe rim of the jar is textured for extra grip, but I\u2019ve found I\u2019ve never needed that texture because the cream doesn\u2019t leave my hands greasy. I have personally had excellent results using this product, and I make a point of applying it after coming in from the barn, before bed, and always after shoveling snow.\n\nO\u2019Keeffe\u2019s Working Hands Hand Cream has a 4.6 out of 5-star rating on Amazon, based on nearly 10,000 reviews.\n\nBob Duncan of Scrollsaw Woodworking & Crafts attests to the value that this hand cream offers woodworkers, writing, \u201cThe salve is the consistency of cold hard butter and it literally melts into your skin. Within a few seconds, the dry skin stops itching and burning, and you can go back to work without worrying about wood or tools slipping out of your grip.\u201d\n\nToolGuyd also posted a favorable review of this hand cream, writing, \u201cIt does relieve dryness. I have only used it a few times and once overnight, but I can definitely tell that it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nThis cream is safe for diabetics to use, and it\u2019s affordable enough to keep a jar in your home, your workplace, and anywhere else where you need protective and healing relief.\n\nPros: Greaseless, odorless, highly affordable\n\nCons: Can sting a bit when applied to cracked hands\n\nThe best lotion for soothing relief\n\nsource Amazon\n\nFormulated for very rough, dry skin, Eucerin Intensive Repair Lotion both gently exfoliates and conditions for healthier skin.\n\nEucerin Intensive Repair Lotion is a rich, creamy lotion that has long-lasting effects. The triple-acting formula moisturizes, exfoliates, and conditions. The gentle exfoliating nature helps to improve the appearance of dry or rough skin, and the moisturizer offers intense hydration that helps to create smooth, comfortable skin. This fragrance-free formula won\u2019t clog pores.\n\nThis is one of my favorite lotions. The pump bottle is quick and easy to use when you\u2019re on the go, and this formula provides soothing relief, even when my hands are at their worst. I particularly like that this lotion is unscented, and it\u2019s easy to massage into my hands.\n\nThere is a bit of a film left on my hands after use, but wiping my hands off with a tissue solves the issue. This lotion is versatile, too; you can also use it on your feet, arms, and other problem areas.\n\nEucerin Intensive Repair Enriched Lotion has a 4.3 out of 5-star rating on Amazon, based on almost 900 reviews.\n\nSandy N. wrote, \u201cThis lotion is heaven sent! I get very dry skin during the winter to the point of rashes, itching, burning, you name it. This lotion has saved my skin. It\u2019s very thick, so I usually apply at night, but it moisturizes like no other lotion I\u2019ve tried.\u201d\n\nPros: Fragrance-free, gentle exfoliating action, won\u2019t clog pores, use on hands, feet, and more\n\nCons: May increase skin\u2019s sensitivity to the sun and increase the chance of sunburn\n\nThe best organic lotion for dry, chapped hands\n\nsource Amazon\n\nCertified organic and available in nine different scents, The Naked Bee Moisturizing Hand & Body Lotion softens and hydrates your skin.\n\nThe Naked Bee Moisturizing Hand & Body Lotion is made in the US and is certified organic.

Plus, a portion of the proceeds from this repair balm benefits US veterans, so you can feel good about your purchase.\n\nOne major advantage of this balm is that you can often see results after just a few uses. It\u2019s much thicker than most lotions, so a little bit goes a long way. With its rapid absorption, you can put a bit of this balm on and go right back to work.\n\nOne Amazon shopper, Edward H, states that this balm is a non-greasy solution to dry hands: \u201cSo glad I found this hand cream. I work in the medical field so I am constantly washing my hands and they get so dry and cracked. I\u2019ve tried so many hand creams but they usually leave your hands greasy which is impossible to use during the day. This stuff is great. It leaves your hands feeling moisturized without the greasy residue. I put it on and continue to go about my day. It does wash off when you wash your hands so you just have to reapply it but I love this stuff and will continue to buy it.\u201d\n\nPros: Made with premium ingredients, offers intense moisturization, no greasy feel\n\nCons: Has a faint natural scent (though no scent is actually added to the balm), more expensive than some other similar products\n\nThe best time-saving treatment\n\nsource Amazon\n\nPut on your NatraCure Gel Moisturizing Gloves for just 20 minutes to get a full moisturizing hand treatment.\n\nLotions, creams, and balms are great ways to treat your irritated hands, but for a deep-moisturizing treatment, NatraCure Gel Moisturizing Gloves give you the intensity that you\u2019re looking for. A non-breathable gel lining locks in moisture, steeping your hands in hydration.\n\nThe instructions say to wear these dermatologist-tested gloves for just 20 minutes two to three times per week. They\u2019re even backed by a satisfaction guarantee, so you can return them to Amazon in the first 30 days if they aren\u2019t just right for you.\n\nI\u2019ve used these gloves for the past three years and they\u2019ve made a significant difference in my skin. I often put them on while watching TV at night, and my hands feel immediately smoother and softer after removing the gloves.\n\nThe lining contains jojoba oil, olive oil, and grapeseed oil which is released by the heat of your hands. It\u2019s like a mini spa treatment in the comfort of your own home. Best of all, these gloves are reusable.\n\nThe NatraCure Gel Moisturizing Gloves have a 3.8 out of 5-star review on Amazon based on 410 reviews. A reviewer called Pam Hogarth says these gloves cleared up her eczema: \u201cI wear them to sleep and, although I feel like Minnie Mouse in them, they have cleared up my eczema! It\u2019s still there. I can feel it lurking: The deep itch is still occasionally there, but my skin is clear, with minimal flaking and my nails are long again.\u201d\n\nYou can also use these gloves with your favorite lotion.\n\nPros: Use for just 20 minutes a few times a week, hypoallergenic, deep moisturizing treatment\n\nCons: Gloves can be difficult to put on (but a little talcum powder can help)", "description": "Business Insider - If you work with your hands or you wash them frequently, you're no stranger to dryness.
