The Pentagon plans to have version 1.0 up and running in a few months. And both versions of the annual National Defense Authorization Act\u2014now in conference committee\u2014have language on the Space Force.\n\nThere are strong arguments that, done right, the space force would be good for America. At this stage, then, it\u2019s worth thinking about what the character of our new force to look like.\n\nAnd where better to look for inspiration than Hollywood? Here are five films that ought to inform how America\u2019s military serves on the high frontier.\n\n5. Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956). This classic black-and-white science fiction thriller is worth watching just to see the aliens mow down the Washington Monument, the Capital and Union Station. As they cruise over the mall, be sure to note the temporary office buildings from World War II still lining the reflecting pool.\n\nRather than be subjugated by superior enemy technology, scientists and soldiers develop an asymmetrical technology that takes down the enemy ships and saves the earth. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll need from our new space force\u2014an innovative cadre of men and women who can out-innovate as much as out-muscle our adversaries in outer space.\n\nHere is hoping the space force is an out-of-the-box thinking creative force.\n\n4. Forbidden Planet (1956). Take Sigmund Freud, William Shakespeare and robots on another planet. Stir. Add in background music composed of \u201celectronic tonalities\u201d that was so innovative and otherworldly it was not considered eligible for an Oscar as a soundtrack. Pour out one of Hollywood\u2019s most iconic outer space movies.\n\nWhat do Commander John J. Adams and his crew have to teach our space force? Disciple and mission-focus are the bywords of this company of space troopers.\n\nGuards and the space cook get extra duty for slacking off. (Though, to be fair, how were they to know the monsters were invisible?)\n\nWhen the ship\u2019s doctor breaks the rules, he winds up dead at the hands of an alien machine. That will teach him.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Does the U.S. military need some inspiration?
