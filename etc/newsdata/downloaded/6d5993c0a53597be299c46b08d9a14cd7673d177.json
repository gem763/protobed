He said waste, specifically used needles, in storm sewers is contributing to ocean pollution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible situation that\u2019s in Los Angeles and in San Francisco,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One on his flight from California to Washington. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to be giving San Francisco, they\u2019re in total violation, we\u2019re going to be giving them a notice very soon.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump descends from Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, after his visit to California.

We can\u2019t have our cities going to hell.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, San Francisco Mayor London Breed said the city has a sewer system that runs effectively, keeping debris from reaching the Bay or the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\u201cIn San Francisco we are focused on advancing solutions to meet the challenges on our streets, not throwing off ridiculous assertions as we board an airplane to leave the state,\u201d Ms. Breed said.\n\nAccording to the EPA website, a notice of violation is a civil administration action the agency can take that doesn\u2019t involve a judicial court process. Such notices don\u2019t mean the EPA has conclusively determined a violation occurred and they typically offer recipients avenues to compliance. The EPA usually sends such notices to companies, not cities. In 2015, the EPA sent a notice to Volkswagen AG charging the auto maker with rigging their cars to pass emissions tests.\n\nMr. Trump traveled to the Bay Area on Tuesday for the first time since his election, attending a roundtable and a fundraiser near Palo Alto. He has repeatedly attacked San Francisco\u2014a largely liberal city whose congresswoman, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) routinely clashes with the president\u2014over its homelessness problem.\n\nBefore the president\u2019s swing through California this week, the Trump administration said it was exploring options to help get homeless people in California off the streets.\n\nMs. Breed said San Francisco is addressing its homeless crisis by dedicating services for the mentally ill and drug addicted, adding 1,000 new shelter beds and seeking voter approval of a $600 million affordable housing bond.\n\n\u201c \u201cThey have to clean it up. We can\u2019t have our cities going to hell.\u201d \u201d \u2014President Trump\n\nThe homeless population has risen this year in major California cities despite efforts by local and state governments to deploy billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded efforts. California hasn\u2019t built enough apartments and homes to keep up with population growth, and many critics say regulations should be eased to spur construction. Paying for outreach programs and new affordable housing simply isn\u2019t enough to match decades of underbuilding, they argue.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a state budget in June investing $1.75 billion in efforts to spur new housing and about $1 billion aimed at helping cities and counties combat homelessness.\n\nHomelessness jumped 12% and 16% from a year ago in the county and city of Los Angeles, respectively, according to figures released this summer based on a count conducted in January. Other localities in California saw substantial increases compared with 2017, when they last conducted a count. In San Francisco, the number rose 17%, while Alameda County, which includes Oakland, saw a 43% increase.\n\n\u2014Alejandro Lazo in San Francisco contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "description": "The Trump administration plans to deliver a notice of environmental violation to San Francisco over its homelessness problem.", "authors": ["Rebecca Ballhaus", "Rebecca.Ballhaus Wsj.Com", "President Trump"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108586/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
