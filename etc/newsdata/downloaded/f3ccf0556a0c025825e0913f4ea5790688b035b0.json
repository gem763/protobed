It appeared as if Sony would be taking its own tack on secret superhero Peter Parker, without needing to integrate him into the continuity of films that began with 2008\u2019s Iron Man.\n\nThe split came at a particularly relevant time, since the latest Sony / Marvel co-op project, Spider-Man: Far From Home, had just taken a radical step with the character. In a mid-credits scene in the film, antagonist Mysterio brings down Spider-Man\u2019s world by revealing Peter\u2019s secret identity. It was a major change for a series that until now has created significant tension through Peter\u2019s attempts to hide who he is, in order to protect the people he cares about. But while the reveal was a surprise, it was in keeping with Marvel Studios\u2019 attitude toward secret identities: for the former to exist, the latter can\u2019t.\n\nIn mainstream American superhero comics going back to the 1940s, heroes go to incredible, convoluted lengths to keep their secret identities under wraps. In the 2016 movie version of the comics arc Civil War, Peter Parker fights Captain America alongside Iron Man in a massive throwdown at a German airport, then goes back to Queens with his Aunt May none the wiser about his extracurricular activities.\n\nBut in the comics version, written by Mark Millar from July 2006 to January 2007, an older Peter Parker reveals his identity to the world to show his support for the Superhuman Registration Act. After Civil War ends, Peter\u2019s choice comes back to haunt him, as the Kingpin puts a hit out on him, and Aunt May gets shot instead. As a last resort to heal May, Peter makes a deal with his enemy Mephisto to erase knowledge of his secret identity from the world \u2014 at the cost of also erasing his marriage with Mary Jane Watson.\n\nSimilarly, Daredevil had the children of Killgrave (known as the Purple Man in the comics, and Kilgrave in first season of the MCU\u2019s Jessica Jones Netflix series), wipe the memory of his secret identity out of the world\u2019s mind after he was outed as Daredevil. Marvel\u2019s recent generation of heroes, like new Spider-Man Miles Morales and new Ms. Marvel Kamala Khan, have experienced the strain that keeping a secret identity puts on those they hold dear.\n\nBut in Marvel\u2019s films, secret identities haven\u2019t been a concern from the very start.\n\n\u201cThe one [common comics trope] we haven\u2019t done in the MCU is the secret identity thing,\u201d Kevin Feige told Bleeding Cool in 2013. \u201cI thought that had been overplayed for a long time, which is why we had Tony Stark out himself at the end of his first movie. We were sort of announcing to the audience that we\u2019re not going to play that game.\u201d And Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s famously ad-libbed line at the end of the first Iron Man didn\u2019t just set the tone for the rest of the MCU, it allowed it to flourish.\n\nThe earlier, non-MCU Spider-Man movies \u2014 the Tobey Maguire years from 2002-2007 and the Andrew Garfield run from 2012-2014 \u2014 could let Peter maintain his secret identity because he was the only hero who mattered to those stories. Director Sam Raimi didn\u2019t have to draw together the narrative threads of multiple Infinity Stones, any more than director Marc Webb had to worry about Spider-Man\u2019s interactions with the larger superhero world, and whether they were consistent with a 10-year story. The MCU\u2019s narrative simply didn\u2019t allow for the self-contained structure of completely isolated hero stories.\n\nAnd the interlinked Infinity Saga, spanning 23 movies, wouldn\u2019t have worked if the heroes were unknown to each other, or to the larger world. The masks had to come off early and often if only to establish complete trust between the heroes. There wouldn\u2019t be enough time to focus on heroes\u2019 pedestrian struggles and their extraordinary ones, while still building up to an intergalactic existential crisis. If every hero had to maintain a secret identity, then every movie by necessity would need some narrative element about keeping that secret safe, which would have quickly become staid and dull.\n\nAnd masks and secrets would just be a barrier against the tight relationships that form the MCU\u2019s emotional heart. By removing secret identities from the equation, the MCU has actually improved on some of its source material, making it more personal and resonant. Most notably, Captain America: Civil War transformed a lopsided debate with a clear right side (Captain America) and wrong side (Iron Man) into a more nuanced argument based in the heroes\u2019 histories and personal obsessions. Tony Stark\u2019s back-and-forth with Steve Rogers over the Sokovia Accords, one of the movie\u2019s most powerful scenes, wouldn\u2019t have been possible if they didn\u2019t know each other so well, or if either of them kept their identity hidden.\n\nThe practicalities of secret identities are also an issue in these films. The MCU asks audiences to suspend their disbelief about super powers, armored flying nano-suits, and magic gems that can unmake reality, but audiences can only accept so much fantasy before they tune out. Heroes maintaining secret identities in this day and age would be one of the MCU\u2019s more unbelievable elements. There\u2019s too much data floating around, too much official surveillance, and too many civilians recording every public event with smartphones for publicly active heroes to keep their real faces under wraps for long. A Stark employee\u2019s misguided click of a phishing email could grant access to Stark\u2019s entire rolodex of heroes, while an alleyway security camera could just as easily reveal Kamala Khan as Ms. Marvel as any villain pulls off her mask.\n\nIn addition to all that, one reason the MCU succeeds is that it doesn\u2019t shy away from what happens to heroes after their masks come off. They have to reckon with the fact that they\u2019re putting everyone around them in danger, and as with Tony Stark\u2019s arc, they still have to weigh the needs of the many against the needs of the few.\n\nThe comics heroes who keep their identities hidden have to balance living two separate lives, while in the MCU, the heroes have to constantly consider how much the \u201csuper\u201d part of their lives bleeds into their \u201cnormal\u201d lives. That may sound like a fine line, but it\u2019s an important distinction, one that makes the MCU\u2019s heroes relatable in a different way. Most people don\u2019t have to think about how they keep their jobs hidden from their family or friends, but they do have to consider work / life balance, and deliberate over how much they\u2019ll let their work life influence how they react to events at home.\n\nAnd now, with his identity out in the open, Peter Parker will have to reckon with all of that, plus public scandal. In a recent interview with Hollywood Reporter, Jake Gyllenhaal said Mysterio\u2019s role was more than just to take E.D.I.T.H. from Peter and create the Mysterio brand. \u201cThe way I look at it is twofold,\u201d he says. \u201cMysterio exists as someone to teach Peter Parker a lesson. In my opinion, there\u2019s no use for just a straight-up bad guy unless there\u2019s a lesson to be learned. And the lesson, particularly for Peter, is what is growing up for real.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe courage that the filmmakers had in Far From Home to say, \u2018We\u2019re gonna bring in a villain that\u2019s going to turn Peter\u2019s world upside down and force him to be who he actually is to the whole world. Nothing\u2019s a secret anymore,\u2019 that was amazing,\u201d Gyllenhaal said. \u201cWhat Mysterio reveals will end up helping Peter, somewhere.\u201d\n\nHow exposure might help Peter remains to be seen, but at least from a storytelling perspective, it will be a break from the previous two Spider-Man films. Peter\u2019s exhaustive efforts to maintain his secret identity are core to both Far From Home and the film before it, Spider-Man: Homecoming. It may help Peter because he\u2019s finally able to live fully as himself \u2014 both Peter Parker and Spider-Man at the same time. That may be uncomfortable at first, and it\u2019s certainly likely to come with danger and pitfalls. But as Gyllenhaal says, that\u2019s what growing up is: being yourself, no matter what, all of the time.\n\nThat sort of growth would have happened regardless of whether Sony and Disney patched up their relationship, and Spider-Man stayed in the MCU. The difference is whether Spider-Man would have had any other heroes to lean on while he goes through this new phase. Had the Sony / Disney split become permanent, Peter likely would have struggled with that transition on his own. That might have been a positive step for the character, but it would have been a major break with the past.\n\nBut now that the companies have reconciled, and Spider-Man is back in the MCU (at least for now), it\u2019s hard to see Marvel letting Peter face this crisis without at least some help from another hero \u2014 perhaps the recently aged Steve Rogers, or new Captain America Sam Wilson, who will undoubtedly be going through some of his own identity-related struggles as he takes over the shield. It\u2019s an intriguing bit of speculation that, for a while at least, Sony and Disney rendered irrelevant. With everyone back on the same side, Marvel is back in the driver\u2019s seat, steering Peter\u2019s story alongside the rest of the MCU \u2014 which means opening up his secrets to the world.", "description": "Spider-Man: Far From Home exposed Peter Parker\u2019s secret identity to the world, but that just brings him in line with other Marvel Cinematic Universe projects, where secret identities aren\u2019t part of the story equation.", "authors": ["Jordan White", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4DB6VKOukhBgrH9Q3_AnbPMd570=/0x0:6720x3518/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16681030/SpiderHaal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
