No one likes losing and no one likes scoring zero.\u201d\n\nThe sending off of winger Fidow presents Samoa with fresh selection problems after the three-game bans handed out to centre Rey Lee-lo and hooker Motu Matu\u2019u for high hits in the Russia game.\n\n\u201cYou try to stop tries, there\u2019s going to be risk and reward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t teach them to go and get yellow cards, by no means to we coach or train that.\u201d\n\nWhile Samoa had delivered a sub-par performance Jackson was full of praise for Scotland, who had opened their World Cup campaign with a woeful 27-3 defeat to Ireland.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to give credit where credit is due. They came out tonight and wanted it more and executed everything that they did. They showed great skill and they moved the ball well.\u201d\n\nA game against tournament hosts Japan, who top the group on nine points, was a good opportunity for Samoa to \u201cget back on the horse\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one win from two games \u2014 both Scotland and Ireland are exactly the same,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we get the result against Japan we\u2019re right back in it.\n\n\u201cBy no means do we think we are down and out after this game.\u201d", "description": "Samoa's hopes of reaching the World Cup quarter-finals suffered a body blow on Monday when they were beaten 34-0 by Scotland but coach Steve Jackson says his side are still in with a shout of advancing from Pool A.", "authors": ["Peter Rutherford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435812006&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9029M", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
