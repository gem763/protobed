But it\u2019s not just agricultural products that have been getting hit \u2014 medical supplies are also feeling pressure.\n\nMichael Einhorn, president of Dealmed, a medical supply distributor, predicts that the trade war will drive up the cost of health care even more. This is because many products rely on China for manufacturing.\n\n\u201cPeople will see an increase,\u201d Einhorn said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move. \u201cThe margins are very thin on health care supplies. They\u2019re very scrutinized \u2026 and ultimately, will be passed on to the consumer.\u201d\n\nPresidents Trump and Xi have not been able to come to a trade agreement.

A recent note from J.P. Morgan puts that number at $1,000 per household. And it\u2019s not just consumer items being affected.\n\n\u201cThink of products like gauze that are made in Band-Aids,\u201d Einhorn said. \u201cThink of other products like medical gloves.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThese products are used on an everyday basis not only on the professional side such as physician offices, surgery centers, and hospitals, but also on the consumer side \u2014 products you\u2019ll buy in a pharmacy. And those products will be somewhat affected somewhere between 10% and 25%.\u201d\n\nAn ICU nurse puts on gloves before entering a patient's room.

First, on September 1, the $300 billion worth of Chinese imports tariffed at a 10% rate are now being taxed at 15%. Second, starting October 1, the existing 25% tariff on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods will become a 30% tariff.\n\nWhile it\u2019s fairly certain that medical supplies will be affected \u2014 since many are imported from China \u2014 it\u2019s unclear how much.\n\n\u201cWhen you throw tariffs into the mix, we\u2019re talking about potential shortages, we\u2019re talking about potential price increases \u2014 not only to hospitals and big health care systems, but also to the consumer at home who may need some products at the pharmacy or ... patient care at home,\u201d Einhorn said.\n\nOur next All Markets Summit is coming up! More\n\n\u2018Medical products should not be tariffed at all\u2019\n\nThe current U.S. health care system already sees exorbitant costs. U.S. health care spending grew 3.9% in 2017, reaching $3.5 trillion or $10,739 per person, according to the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS). That accounts for about 17.9% of the nation\u2019s GDP.", "description": "U.S.-China trade tensions continue to escalate as new tariffs took effect on September 1.", "authors": ["Adriana Belmonte", "Associate Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HtXVYBsQAlj.V.2Oqb_6.Q--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/2bf7bc80-c8e6-11e9-bf7e-f387b6a4b2f5"}
