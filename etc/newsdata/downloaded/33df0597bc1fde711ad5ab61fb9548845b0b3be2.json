I think there is a recognition in the capitals, in the foreign ministers I\u2019ve been speaking to that they want to see a no-deal avoided, they want the teams to reach a deal.\n\n\"There is a clear message from President Juncker and from the prime minister that a deal is doable. But at the same time there is significant work still to do but there is serious discussions that are taking place.\n\n\"We are moving forward with momentum, talks will continue next week between the technical teams and it\u2019s important that we deliver a deal because that is in the interest of the United Kingdom and indeed in the interest of the European Union as we move forward to a strong future relationship, which is where we all want to go.\"\n\nMore follows\u2026", "description": "The European Union has\u00a0rejected a request from the British government for a Brexit deal without a\u00a0Irish backstop in.
