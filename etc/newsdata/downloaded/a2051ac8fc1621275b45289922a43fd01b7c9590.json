She would require presidents and vice presidents to place business assets in a blind trust to be sold and require other senior officials to divest assets that could present conflicts.\n\nTrump maintains ownership of his businesses but has ceded day-to-day control to his sons. Last week, Trump said that before November 2020, he would release an \"extremely complete\" financial report.\n\nWarren noted that T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: ) Inc, which won Justice Department approval to merge with Sprint Corp in July, \"sent its top executives to the Trump Hotel in DC right after the company announced a merger.\"\n\nOn Friday, a federal appeals court revived a lawsuit alleging that Trump violated the U.S. Constitution by profiting from foreign and domestic officials who patronized his properties. Trump denies the allegations.\n\nWarren wants to ban lobbyists from all fundraising activities including hosting events or serving as campaign bundlers, bar senior officials and Congress from trading individual stocks and pay congressional staff \"competitive\" salaries with the private sector. She would bar all federal employees from becoming corporate lobbyists for six years after leaving government.\n\nShe would also prohibit courts from using sealed settlements to conceal evidence in cases involving public health or safety and allow the public to sue federal agencies to enforce rules.\n\nWarren cited General Motors (NYSE: ) Co's decision more than a decade ago to settle some cases involving deadly ignition switch defects on the condition the terms remain confidential.", "description": "Democratic hopeful Warren seeks to curb U.S. lobbying, corporate power", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8F0PZ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
