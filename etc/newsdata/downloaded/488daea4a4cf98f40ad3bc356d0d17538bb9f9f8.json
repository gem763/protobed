A great coat, versatile dresses, chic separates to mix in with the clothes you already have, cosy comforting knits and some footwear to withstand the weather.\n\nAnd there's one high street brand in particular that's making it easy to create the perfect autumnal aesthetic.\n\nMarks & Spencer's beloved Per Una label has had a new season makeover just in time for our own and you might be surprised by its latest collection of elegant wardrobe essentials.\n\nLeaving behind its heritage of a fussy and frilly take on femininity, you'll find a more youthful approach with contemporary silhouettes, luxurious tactile fabrics and a modern take on floral prints.\n\n2019's Per Una is all about fresh, beautifully made separates and flattering denim that work effortlessly together, so styling is simple. With a nod to seasonal trends, it's timeless without being old fashioned and chic without being formal, so you'll be wearing its new designs for years to come.\n\nFrom cool girl cords to the softest sweaters, it's time to find your new favourite clothes. Here's everything you'll need for a stylish season.\n\nDresses to die for\n\nPer Una Satin Jacquard Shirred Detail Dress (\u00a349.50) at Marks & Spencer\n\nL-R: Satin Jacquard Shirred Detail Dress (\u00a349.50) and Cupro Ditsy Relaxed Midi Dress (\u00a365) both Per Una at Marks & Spencer\n\nWe love a mini dress, but thank goodness for the midi.\n\nThis longer style, hitting midway between knee and ankle, is a fashion lifesaver. Without the impracticality of a maxi dress, but more demure than those cut above the knee, it's the perfect in between look that works all year long.\n\nA midi is quick to style; wear with opaque tights or thick socks and ankle boots now, switching to bare legs in the spring. And if you're really feeling the chill, simply layer a long sleeved tee or fine knit polo neck underneath.\n\nAnd for AW19, Per Una is nailing this feminine, floaty trend, making it easy for us to do the same.\n\nWe predict a sell-out of its silky jacquard midi (above centre) which features a flattering V-neck and pretty elasticated cuffs.\n\nAnd for a relaxed everyday dress that will make mornings easy, this flowery khaki number (above right) has got you covered.\n\nAll hail the midi dress.\n\nThe softest sweaters\n\nColour Block Funnel Neck Jumper (\u00a345) and Corduroy Wide Leg Cropped Trousers (\u00a339.50) both Per Una at Marks & Spencer\n\nL-R: Colour Block Funnel Neck Jumper (\u00a345) and Cable Knit Roll Neck Relaxed Fit Jumper (\u00a339.50) both Per Una at Marks & Spencer\n\nWho doesn't love wrapping up in a cosy knit when the temperature drops?\n\nAnd there's no need to sacrifice on style, just because you're doing your best to stay toasty.\n\nPer Una's gorgeous selection of sweaters will not only keep out the cold but are perfect for styling with the rest of your wardrobe.\n\nWhether you opt for a contemporary colour block (above left), a classic cable knit (above right) or fitted navy jumper (below right), a high neck will take you all the way through winter and will look great with denim on an off-duty day.\n\nL-R: Alpaca Wool V Neck jumper (\u00a345) and Cable Roll Neck Jumper (\u00a335) both Per Una at Marks & Spencer\n\nOr for a relaxed take on elegance, layer an oversized V-neck like this one (above left) with a slinky skirt to play up the contrast of textures and proportion.\n\nSturdy ankle boots or retro trainers will be the ideal finishing touch.\n\nThe denim of dreams\n\nL-R: Straight Leg Jeans in medium indigo (\u00a335) and Kick Flare Jeans in black (\u00a335) both Per Una at Marks & Spencer\n\nDenim is a wardrobe staple and a go-to for all stylish women everywhere.\n\nAnd while the trends in jeans come and go, there are some classic cuts that will always be in style.\n\nPer Una's straight leg jeans (above left) will become a favourite thanks to their easy-to-wear soft stretch while these cool kick-flare jeans (above right) in black will add a touch of fashion editor edge to your new season look. Plus they'll work to lengthen legs and streamline the silhouette thanks to their ultra chic high waist.\n\nWear with a pretty blouse or a chunky knit for day and a silky camisole for date night.\n\nModern florals\n\nPer Una Satin Floral Print Blouse (\u00a335) at Marks & Spencer\n\nFloral prints are a perennial trend which get a rework every season, both by the high end designers on the catwalk as well as on the high street.\n\nAnd if you love a blossom motif but want to keep it fresh, then inject your look with some of Per Una's beautiful autumn blooms.\n\nAnyone looking for romance will find it with this lovely blouse (above).\n\nThe wildflower print is incredibly pretty and with its billowing sleeves and high neck, it's got Bohemian beauty written all over it. Half tuck it or let it hang loose for an upgrade on a casual outfit. Perfect for brunch with the girls or dinner with the in-laws.\n\nL-R: Floral Pyjama Style Top (\u00a339.50) and Satin Floral Wide Leg Cropped Trousers (\u00a349.50) both Per Una at Marks & Spencer\n\nAnd this luxe pyjama set (above) is not for the bedroom. Take it out on the town styled together in a louche matching set, adding a pair of high heel sandals for evening.\n\nBut if you fancy mixing things up then rock the top with a pair of jeans and work the bottoms with a roomy jumper and boots.\n\nThree outfits in one? Yes please.\n\nMaking covering up cool\n\nL-R: Floral Print Shirt Midi Dress (\u00a355); Wool Blend Cocoon Coat (\u00a3129), Satin Floral Print Blouse (\u00a335), Kick Flare Jeans in black (\u00a335) all Per Una at Marks & Spencer\n\nIt's about this time of year we start looking for a new winter coat.\n\nAnd whether you want protection from the rain or protection from the cold, you'll still want your outerwear to look good.\n\nWith coat trends ranging from puffer jackets to checks and faux fur to shearling, there are a lot of ways to be chic this season.\n\nL-R: Wool Blend Cocoon Coat (\u00a3129) and Longline Wax Look Coat (\u00a399) both Per Una at Marks & Spencer\n\nWe love Per Una's statement cocoon coat in an eye-catching shade of purple (above left). It'll look amazing over slim fit jeans, a tee and boots and then when the freeze really sets in, wear it over chunkier sweaters.\n\nAnd make the great outdoors your runway in this long line wax look coat (above right). With a hood and contrasting cord collar, you'll be safe from the elements and look stylish to boot.\n\nPer Una Velvet Belted Blazer (\u00a389)\n\nAs every fashion maven knows, a blazer is a safe bet for smartening up any look.\n\nTailoring brings a formality to jeans and T-shirts that other jackets just can't and with this velvet version by Per Una (above), you'll be getting a bit of effortless luxury too.\n\nSuper soft and elegantly cut, this belted blazer (above) is the perfect feminine take on a masculine standard.\n\nCorduroy cut to flatter\n\nPer Una Cable Knit Roll Neck Relaxed Fit Jumper (\u00a339.50), Corduroy Wide Leg Cropped Trousers (\u00a339.50) and Leather Western Ankle Boots (\u00a375) all at Marks & Spencer\n\nAs we move from summer into autumn we love the switch from lightweight linens and cotton to more heavy duty fabrics.\n\nAnd a retro classic that's back in a big way is corduroy.\n\nNow, ignore all those childhood memories of cord that are flooding back and embrace a more modern take with these trousers from Per Una at Marks & Spencer.\n\nL-R: Corduroy Wide Leg Cropped Trousers in terracotta and chocolate both \u00a339.50; Corduroy Slim Flare Trousers in bordeaux ( \u00a339.50), all Per Una at Marks & Spencer\n\nBag an on-trend wide leg crop in navy, black or terracotta (above left) or elongate your silhouette with these sleek flares in a rich shade of burgundy (above right).\n\nWhichever you choose, wear with ankle boots and chunky polo neck knits for a look that'll ensure this season is your most stylish yet.", "description": "Autumn is well under way and as the days become colder and the leaves turn to gold, it's time to rethink our style for the new season.", "authors": ["Mailonline Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/10/19387246-0-image-a-12_1570439380119.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
