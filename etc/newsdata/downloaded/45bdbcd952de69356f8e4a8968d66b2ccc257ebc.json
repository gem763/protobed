He's going to have surgery to remove the Morton's neuroma in his right foot this week.\n\nMLB.com's Rhett Bollinger added that Trout's season is over.\n\nTrout had a minor procedure on his foot Monday to help with pain he was dealing with due to a nerve issue. He was originally considered day-to-day but hasn't been in the Angels lineup since Sept. 7.\n\nIn his eighth full MLB season, Trout is once again putting up MVP-caliber numbers. He will finish 2019 with a .291/.438/.645 slash line, 45 homers, 104 RBI and 110 runs scored in 134 games.\n\nDespite Trout's best efforts, the Angels enter Sunday fourth in the American League West with a 67-82 record.\n\nTrout has avoided major injuries throughout his career, missing more than 30 games just once. By ending his season now, the Angels are allowing their superstar to get back to full strength in time for spring training next February.", "description": "Los Angeles Angels  outfielder  Mike Trout 's season has come to an early end due to lingering problems with his foot.
