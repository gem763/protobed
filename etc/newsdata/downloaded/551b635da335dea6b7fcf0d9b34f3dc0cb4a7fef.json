To force an election via that route, Johnson needs to win the votes of two-thirds of MPs.\n\nHis previous two attempts to hold an election were thwarted after Jeremy Corbyn ordered Labour MPs to block it.\n\nThe Labour leader has said he will only vote for an election once the European Union has offered an extension to Article 50, removing the threat of a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\nEU leaders are expected to grant a delay, but have yet to announce how long it will be.\n\nIn a letter to Corbyn, Johnson said Parliament had \u201crefused to take decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt cannot refuse to let the voters replace it with a new Parliament that can make decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cProlonging this paralysis into 2020 would have dangerous consequences for businesses, jobs and for basic confidence in democratic institutions, already badly damaged by the behavior of Parliament since the referendum. Parliament cannot continue to hold the country hostage.\n\n\u201cYou have repeatedly said that once the EU accepts Parliament\u2019s request for a delay until Jan. 31, then you would immediately support an election.\u201d\n\nJohnson added: \u201cI assume this remains your position and therefore you will support an election next week so the voters can replace this broken Parliament.\u201d\n\nIn response, Labour said it would back an election if a no-deal Brexit is \u201ctaken off the table\u201d and if the Article 50 extension offered by the EU, which is expected Friday, \u201callows\u201d for that.", "description": "The prime minister said he would give Parliament more time to debate his Brexit deal as long as it agrees to an election before Christmas.", "authors": ["Assistant Political Editor", "Huffpost Uk"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db1d19d210000272dad3d07.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
