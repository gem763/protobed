She took a scrape from my mouth.\n\n\"She returned after about 15 minutes she told me there had been a slight change of colour and she would place me under arrest.\n\n\"I told them I have not done drugs and never have.\n\n\"Unfortunately having droopy, heavy eyes is a genetic condition - my father has them and so do I.\n\n\"I have had an operation on them in the past but they were definitely not bloodshot.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"My mouth was dry because I was nervous and anxious, as anybody would be while sat in the back of a police car.\"\n\nMagistrates in Poole heard that once at the police station a blood test was taken was taken on Mr Redknapp.\n\nHe said he told officers he had a phobia of needles and claimed that he was lead into a room where one was deliberately left out for him by a nurse.\n\nHowever, Charles Nightingale, prosecuting, disputed his account.\n\nHe said: \"You say you saw the needle when you came in but that is simply not how it works.\n\n\"She was the professional and you were the accused. You are nervous, anxious and have a history of fainting in these situations.\n\n\"I would suggest that her account is accurate and you are simply mistaken.\"\n\nMr Redknapp was stopped by police in his Mercedes C63 saloon car in the posh Canford Cliffs suburb of Poole at 8pm on April 2, 2018.\n\nA blood test later showed he had 749 micrograms of cocaine derivative benzoylecgonine in his system.\n\nThe legal limit is 50.\n\nIn his statement Mr Sackey, 39, said he was the godfather to Mr Redknapp's sons and had been with the defendant on the evening of March 31, 2018.\n\nHe said: \"I have known Mark for around ten years. We initially met through his brother Jamie as we have the same agent.\n\n\"He is a close personal friend and I am the godfather to his sons.\n\n\"On March 31 I had gone to see his sons in Bournemouth and we played football and rugby in the garden.\n\n\"In the evening we drank Peroni, watched Match of the Day and boxing.\n\n\"I stayed at Mark's and everything was normal.\n\n\"As a professional sportsman I have never taken drugs and to my knowledge no one took drugs that night.\n\n\"There were no signs such as getting up a lot to go to the toilet. He was just his normal bubbly self.\n\n\"He is an amazing family man and Mark has never taken drugs in my company.\"\n\nMr Redknapp, from Poole, denies charge of driving a vehicle while over the specified drug limit.\n\nThe case continues.", "description": "Mark Redknapp, 49, says he has never taken drugs and denies a charge of driving a vehicle while over the specified drug limit", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Bnps", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578989.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-BNPS_MarkRedknapp_04.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
