The amount of sugar a person should eat in a day depends on how old they are. Children aged four to six years old should be limited to a maximum of 19g per day. Seven to 10-year-olds should have no more than 24g, and children aged 11 and over should have 30g or less. Meanwhile the NHS recommends adults have no more than 30g of free sugars a day. Popular snacks contain a surprising amount of sugar and even a single can of Coca Cola (35g of sugar) or one Mars bar (33g) contains more than the maximum amount of sugar a child should have over a whole day. A bowl of Frosties contains 24g of sugar, meaning a 10-year-old who has Frosties for breakfast has probably reached their limit for the day before they even leave the house. Children who eat too much sugar risk damaging their teeth, putting on fat and becoming overweight, and getting type 2 diabetes which increases the risk of heart disease and cancer.
