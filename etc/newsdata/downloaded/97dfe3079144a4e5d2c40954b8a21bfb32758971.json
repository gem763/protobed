They can subpoena people and, yes, they can bring criminal charges.\"\n\nHe said that it \"obviously puts [the investigation] on a new footing.\"\n\nThe investigation's new status means Durham can subpoena witnesses, file charges, and impanel fact-finding grand juries.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are hammering the move.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff released a statement saying that the reports, \"raise profound new concerns that the Department of Justice under Attorney General William Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump's political revenge. If the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage.\"\n\nThe Judiciary Committee's ranking member, Rep. Doug Collins, responded via Twitter: \"If Durham finds crimes were committed, I'm confident he'll pursue justice and help restore America's confidence in our premier law enforcement agency. Chairman Nadler is wrong to suggest this investigation is anything less than an effort to deliver truth and accountability.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"And, if you're one of the people that were involved in the Trump Russia investigation in 2016 -- whether it's James Comey or Andrew McCabe or Strzok or Page or all of those people -- they now face the greater possibility, not the certainty, but the possibility of legal jeopardy,\" Wallace told Smith.\n\n\"I have to laugh because you see the Republicans attacking the Democrats for the impeachment investigation, and now you see the Democrats attacking the Republicans for this investigation,\" he noted.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re, Jake Gibson, and Ed Henry contributed to this report.", "description": "Investigators examining the\u00a0Russia investigation\u00a0should \"let it all come out and pursue the truth,\" said Chris Wallace, host of \"Fox News Sunday.\"", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/WALLACE-COPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
