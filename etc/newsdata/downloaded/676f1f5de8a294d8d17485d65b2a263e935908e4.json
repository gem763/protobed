Last year the criminal court sentenced three men to up to 309 years each for trafficking children for prostitution.\n\nIn both cases, courts capped the imprisonment period at 50 years in accordance with Thai law.\n\nPapop Siamhan, an independent lawyer with expertise in human trafficking, said child prostitution cases resulted in long prison sentences because they often involved several laws and many children.\n\n\"Long prison sentences will act as a deterrent because people will be afraid to commit such crimes, and it will also result in authorities and judges being more careful when handling such cases,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this year the United States praised Thailand for sentencing convicted traffickers and complicit officials to significant prison terms in its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report.\n\nThailand was ranked as a Tier 2 country in the report, meaning it is making significant efforts to combat the crime.\n\nSince January this year, courts have handed down 170 prison sentences in trafficking cases of which 74 were sentences of more than 10 years, according to the Court of Justice.\n\nArchana Kotecha, Asia region director and head of legal at anti-slavery charity Liberty Shared, said long sentences can be effective deterrents when they are addressed at kingpins in trafficking cases and not low level offenders.\n\nBut she said this must be accompanied by seizure of assets which should be used to pay compensation to victims.\n\n\"Deterrence aimed at the freedom and assets of offenders is likely more effective and holistic as it takes into account the need to compensate victims for what they have endured and removes the commercial gain made by the offender,\" she said.\n\n($1 = 30.3100 baht) (Reporting by Nanchanok Wongsamuth, Guilbert, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith.
