Most but not all have also reported using THC, the chemical in marijuana, the agency said.\n\nIn May, Walmart, America's biggest retailer, said it would stop selling fruit-flavoured e-cigarettes, which have been blamed for appealing to youth.\n\nWalmart continues to sell guns and traditional cigarettes, but it has imposed new limits on those products.\n\nIn May, the company said it would not sell traditional cigarettes to those under the age of 21.\n\nWalmart also announced this month that it would stop sales of certain types of ammunition and guns.", "description": "The move comes amid mounting calls to ban the products, which have been linked to a deadly outbreak of lung illness.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12F33/production/_108891677_gettyimages-1169200963.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
