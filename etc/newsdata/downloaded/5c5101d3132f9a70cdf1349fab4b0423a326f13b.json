Rugby World Cup team of round two 1/15 1, Ellis Genge (England) The loosehead prop may have only come on for England at half-time, but there had not been a run at the World Cup from a prop quite like what Genge produced against the USA. A barn-storming run saw him outpace one defender and trample over another, breaking the best part of 50 metres before it took two men to stop him. He was also excellent in the scrum to win countless penalties as the USA wilted. AP 2/15 2. Julian Montoya (Argentina) It takes something special to shine in Agustin Creevy\u2019s absence, but Montoya delivered with an excellent hat-trick to help lead Argentina to victory over Tonga. Montoya was smart to stay wide following a lineout for his first try, was the beneficiary of the rolling maul for the second and powered his way over from close range for a classy 26-minute hat-trick. AP 3/15 3. Levan Chilachava (Georgia) It\u2019s not often a Georgian makes the team of the round, but Chilachava lead an inspired Georgian pack to dominate Uruguay in their Sunday clash, scoring a try in the bonus-point victory and monstering the opposition front row in the scrum.

Lood de Jager (South Africa) The Springbok needed a big performance to strengthen his case for selection in what is a very competitive area for South Africa, and the giant second row delivered emphatically with a man-of-the-match performance. He may not have got on the scoresheet, but his impact in destroying Namibia\u2019s gameplan was standout nonetheless. AP 6/15 6. Aaron Wainwright (Wales) A young player whose development at the World Cup is really turning heads. Wainwright did not look out of place up against one of the greats of the game against David Pocock, and it was his ball-carrying ability that really stood out in an eye-catching performance. Getty Images 7/15 7. Lewis Ludlam (England) A remarkable rise to prominence saw Ludlam score his first World Cup try for England in the demolition of the USA, but it was his all-round performance last week that earns him his place in the side. From nowhere, Ludlam is emerging as a very important member of the England team. AFP/Getty Images 8/15 8. Michael Leitch (Japan) Another substitute who made such a strong contribution to a winning cause. Leitch came on after the half-hour mark to replace Amanaki Mafi and lead by example, setting the tone for Japan\u2019s latest great upset. EPA 9/15 9. Gareth Davies (Wales) Australia could not keep Davies out of the game in Tokyo, with the scrum-half twice intercepting Will Genia and Bernard Foley and nearly bagging himself a third in the second half. He was also excellent at injecting pace into the game and tried to catch the defence napping throughout. Getty Images 10/15 10. Felipe Berchesi (Uruguay) The Uruguayan was excellent in Uruguay\u2019s victory over Fiji, with the South American\u2019s forced to double-up across the round by playing Georgia a handful of days later. Berchesi had to make do with a team on the back foot more often than not, yet managed to release his outside backs to run Fiji ragged. AFP/Getty Images 11/15 11. Makazole Mapimpi (South Africa) Mapimpi emerged from the shadow of Cheslin Kolbe to star in South Africa\u2019s rout of Namibia, scoring two tries to trigger the landslide victory. Mapimpi may not get the shower of praise that his elusive teammate receives, but he showed how dangerous he can be with the ball in hand, showing a devastating turn of pace backed up by some serious power.

Lukhanyo Am (South Africa) The third Springbok to feature in the side, Am enjoyed possible his best outing at international level, bagging a try himself on the 57-3 victory immediately after half-time as they picked up where they left off.

Kotaro Matsushima (Japan) The only man to retain his spot in the side after yet another strong showing in Shizuoka, Matsushima is establishing himself as one of the must-watch players at the World Cup.

AP\n\n\u201cI had the scan straight after the game on the Sunday and found out the results on the Sunday afternoon, and then didn't find out what the specialist said until the Tuesday so there was a bit of waiting around. It was touch and go and the first week was tough.\n\n\u201cWhen I had the scan and got the results back it wasn't ideal but luckily the specialist was able to clear it up and I am just happy to be here now and get that game under my belt.\u201d\n\nAt least Vunipola has that taste of rugby in August to keep him going, having initially torn his hamstring in May. Nowell never had that, and as the four-month wait for rugby went on, there were certainly some dark times for the Exeter wing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been close to coming back, then I\u2019ve hit a hurdle,\u201d added Nowell. \u201cBut for me I\u2019ve always wanted to be here, I\u2019ve driven so hard to try to be involved in this World Cup. They were just hurdles, something I had to overcome to get myself involved again.\n\n\u201cThere were no deadlines. If anything it was probably me pushing it at the start and me saying I want to be back for this game and be involved as soon as I can, to be out training. It was quite nice to actually not have a deadline, but I gave myself deadlines and if I didn\u2019t hit them I got pretty upset with myself.\n\n\u201cTo get so far and then have my appendix out just as I think I am back... USA was one I wanted to be fit for and I was fit for that, but Eddie said we will give you another week of training, get your confidence up and if I trained well enough then I could be involved in this game.\u201d\n\nSuch is the importance of Vunipola and Nowell to England\u2019s World Cup aspirations, Jones was willing to use up two of his 31 squad places on players he knew would not be available for the first two matches of the campaign. It was always a gamble to take them in the first place given the severity of the injuries, particularly when players like Ben Moon and Mike Brown were ready and waiting for the call.\n\nThe problem for Vunipola and Nowell was that the damage was not just physical. \u201cIt was more a mental challenge than anything else,\u201d added Vunipola. \u201cAs players you are very impatient and you want to get out there straightaway, and when you see the boys going so well in training and in games you want to be a part of that. It was about biding my time and just getting ready for whenever I got my chance.\n\n\u201cI was leaning on family and friends but luckily here I have some good mates in the team and people start taking notice if you start to pull yourself away, they pull you back in. I always knew there was a target to be involved in this game and luckily I was able to play.\u201d\n\nBut those fears are allayed, and the pair could now find themselves starting against France in England\u2019s final pool game. For both of them, it is now about repaying that faith, which started on Saturday as Nowell got himself across the try line just six minutes after coming on.\n\n\u201cI was quite shocked I was still on my feet to be honest!\u201d said Nowell. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to cap it with a try, but I\u2019m just very thankful for the hard work the physios have put in, the people around me. I\u2019ve always felt very involved in the squad still. It\u2019s very easy to slip out and feel a bit isolated when you\u2019re injured. But what we\u2019ve been very good at this World Cup is how together we are. To finally repay a bit back to the boys is good.\n\n\u201cBeing backed by Eddie [was important. I could quite easily have been sent home but they spent a bit of time on me and to be able to give back is very nice.\u201d\n\nIt was of course a coincidence that they were both injured at the same time, but the silver lining in that meant that while they were kept away from the rest of the squad to train on their own, they were able to drag each other through the difficult times.\n\n\"It was nice,\u201d recalled Vunipola. \u201cIt's not nice to have people with you when you are injured [because you\u2019re both injured] but it was good to have Jack there. We supported each other through the injury together, so it was good. But the support we had around us from team-mates, from family, that's the main thing.\"\n\nWhile many teams have already lost players from their original World Cup squads, England are adding them as the business end approaches. It could well prove a risk that was not only worth taking, but provides the difference in the games that lie ahead.", "description": "Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell made their Rugby World Cup 2019 bows on Saturday, returning from months of injury rehabilitation to justify Eddie Jones\u2019s gamble on taking them to Japan.
