Increasingly, he does not like what he\u2019s seeing.\n\nOn Thursday Donald Trump lashed out at the typically loyalist network following a Fox News poll that found that 51% of respondents wanted to see the president impeached and removed from office and an additional 4% said he should be impeached but not removed.\n\n\u201cFrom the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll,\u201d he tweeted on Thursday. \u201cWhoever their Pollster is, they suck.\u201d\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) From the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme....\n\nFox News is \u201cmuch different than it used to be in the good old days\u201d, he added, going on to catalogue a series of hosts and contributors to the network that have displayed insufficient deference in his estimation. Fox News \u201cdoesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be.\u201d\n\nThe comments echoed a similar sentiment he expressed in August, writing: \u201cWe have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn\u2019t working for us anymore!\u201d\n\nTrump, may, however be cheered after Friday afternoon\u2019s news that the Fox News anchor Shepard Smith \u2013 who recently criticized him \u2013 is leaving the network.\n\nPopularity\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to frame Fox News as playing a subservient roll to the president, but in truth it\u2019s always been more of a symbiotic partnership, with the popularity of one bolstering the other and vice versa.\n\nAs fractures within the Fox network have grown, and many of their news anchors have become more stridently critical of Trump following the revelations of the impeachment inquiry, it may well be that Fox News, and other conservative media, are starting to wonder if it might be wise to make plans for a post-Trump future.\n\nOutside of Fox News, another arbiter of the prevailing political winds on the right has long been Matt Drudge, whose website is a major driver of traffic to rightwing news sources.\n\nAs CNN noted, Drudge has become particularly aggressive in covering news of the impeachment inquiry of late, including giving prominence to stories about Fox News personalities such as Andrew Napolitano \u2013 who called Trump\u2019s actions \u201ccriminal and impeachable\u201d \u2013 and Shepard Smith\u2019s suggestion Trump may have broken the law.\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson dismisses white supremacy as 'a hoax' Read more\n\nEven Tucker Carlson took to the pages of the website he founded, the Daily Caller, to criticize Trump for pressuring a foreign leader for his own personal political gain this week. There is \u201cno way to spin this as a good idea\u201d, he wrote. Carlson remains a staunch supporter of Trump on his Fox News program, but here, he\u2019s hedging his bets.\n\nPrevious reports of the demise of the Trump-Fox marriage may have been greatly exaggerated, and the news about Smith will be seen by some as evidence of its health, but arguably there does seem to be something different this time around. The mounting evidence in the impeachment inquiry is not helping, and Trump\u2019s reckless actions in Syria this week have drawn criticism from a number of reliably lockstep supporters, like Republican senator and Senate judiciary committee chairman Lindsey Graham, who called it \u201cthe biggest blunder of his presidency\u201d. Fox & Friends\u2019 Brian Kilmeade called the decision \u201cdisastrous\u201d. Breitbart also ran a critical story.\n\nNo doubt many of Trump\u2019s supporters relish his breaking of political and governing norms, but it\u2019s also possible his abandonment of US allies, his refusal to cooperate with a lawful impeachment inquiry and the mounting allegations of obstruction of justice may turn off a small but significant enough percentage of Republican voters who held their noses to cast their ballot for him in 2016.\n\nTrump abandoning Kurds could cost support of evangelical Christians Read more\n\nRemaining Trump defenders like Rush Limbaugh have noted the shift in Drudge\u2019s coverage. Limbaugh too has pointed to the new tenor at Fox News, saying it should now be called \u201cFox Never Trumper Network\u201d.\n\nUnable to countenance even the most minor of criticism, Trump has reportedly come to consider more extreme sites like Breitbart, and networks like OAN as his remaining trusted bulwarks of support, but the reach of either, or track record for setting the political agenda, pales in comparison to that of Fox News, or Drudge for that matter.\n\nFor all their manifold faults, Fox News as an institution is nothing if not savvy arbiters of the shifting political winds. Anchors like Smith and Chris Wallace, and contributors like Napolitano who have become regular critics of Trump, seem to be slowly introducing the concept of a break with Trump to the Fox News audience piece by piece, as a trial balloon.\n\nHow it will be received by the audience remains to be seen, but the existence of the conservative electorate and ratings do not rest wholly on the success of one man.", "description": "Some Fox anchors have become more stridently critical of Trump following the revelations of the impeachment inquiry", "authors": ["Luke O'Neil"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49c3bfd4d7e854f5aa0e2bdf7bd99dcefc91ecec/0_66_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4f47939d0946bcf46d4ce9ab46caf19", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
