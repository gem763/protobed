I was being friendly letting people stay in the flat and they have repaid me by attacking me.\n\n\u2018The injuries I suffered left me in intensive care for four days on a ventilator and I realise I could have died if my partner had not have kicked the door in.\u2019\n\nDetective Constable Emma Beadle, of Northumbria Police\u2018s Central CID, said: \u2018I am delighted with the lengthy custodial sentence handed to Bradley Topp and I know the victim in this case is too.\n\n\u2018This was a sustained attack on a man inside his own home and when it had come to an end, Topp left his victim there to die.\n\n\u2018Thankfully the victim has been able to make a full recovery but he has been left scarred for life with part of his ear missing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The physical injuries have since healed but this would be a traumatising incident for anyone and I know it has deeply affected him.\n\n\u2018I hope he can take comfort from knowing that this violent and dangerous offender is behind bars and cannot do him any further harm.\n\n\u2018The streets are safer with Bradley Topp in prison and I hope this sentence reassures the public about our commitment to putting violent offenders before the courts.\u2019\n\nA second man, aged 33, had also been arrested in connection with the attack but died before charges were brought in the case.\n\nIt could not be proved which attacker was responsible for biting off the victim\u2019s ear.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
