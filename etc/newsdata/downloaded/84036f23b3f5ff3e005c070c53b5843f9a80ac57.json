Biden says he told Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Kiev in December 2015 that the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees if Shokin remained on the job.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN\n\nBiden\u2019s son served on the board of Burisma Group, a privately held natural gas producer, between 2014 and 2018. Critics have suggested he was not doing actual work for the company, an allegation he denies.\n\nBurisma has faced allegations of dodging taxes and improperly securing licenses for gas deposits.\n\nUkrainian officials announced on Oct. 4 that they would review 15 previous investigations related to Burisma, and the country\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Bureau said in September it was investigating activity at Burisma between 2010 and 2012, prior to Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement. The company denies any wrongdoing.\n\nUkraine\u2019s top prosecutor, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, told Reuters he was not aware of any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.\n\nWILLIAM BARR\n\nIn the July 25 phone call, Trump encouraged Zelenskiy to work with Barr, the U.S. attorney general, to investigate Joe Biden and his son. Barr didn\u2019t learn of the call until several weeks after it took place, and hasn\u2019t communicated with Ukraine, according to the Justice Department.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump attends Young Black Leadership Summit at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 4, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nBut in his nine months as the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official, Barr has taken several actions that have benefited Trump and caused Democrats to question his independence. He decided in March not to prosecute Trump for obstruction of justice for interfering with Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election.\n\nWhen he released Mueller\u2019s report in April, Barr echoed Trump\u2019s refrain that the special counsel had found \u201cno collusion\u201d between his campaign and Russia. Mueller in fact had concluded that there was not enough evidence to bring criminal conspiracy charges, but outlined numerous examples where campaign officials welcomed Russian interference in the election.\n\nIn May, Barr announced an investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe, acting on accusations by Trump\u2019s political allies that FBI and intelligence officials were trying to undermine his political prospects. Barr has enlisted Trump to encourage foreign governments to cooperate with the investigation and, according to media reports, has traveled internationally to meet with foreign officials on the matter.\n\nMIKE POMPEO\n\nThe U.S. secretary of state, a vocal Trump supporter, was on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy but did not say whether he heard anything unusual. He has resisted Democrats\u2019 efforts to obtain depositions of current and former State Department officials as part of their impeachment inquiry.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel says Pompeo is a \u201cfact witness\u201d and has accused him of stonewalling their inquiry.\n\nBefore becoming the United States\u2019 top diplomat, Pompeo was Trump\u2019s CIA chief and before that a Republican congressman.\n\nKURT VOLKER\n\nA former U.S. special representative for Ukraine, Volker was one of two American diplomats who pressured their Ukrainian counterparts to launch investigations that could benefit Trump, according to text messages he provided to Congress. Volker worked with Giuliani on the effort, the messages show.\n\nThose communications show he told a Ukrainian official that a meeting between the countries\u2019 two leaders was tied to Kiev\u2019s agreement to investigate the 2016 U.S. election. He later pressured Ukraine to issue a public statement announcing probes into Burisma and the 2016 election.\n\nVolker resigned his post in late September.\n\nGORDON SONDLAND\n\nSondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, was also involved in the effort to get Ukraine to investigate Biden and the 2016 election, the text messages show.\n\nIn one exchange, Sondland sought to quell concerns by another U.S. ambassador, Bill Taylor - who as charge d\u2019affaires in Ukraine is the senior diplomat there - that the Trump administration was withholding foreign aid until Kiev agreed to help with Trump\u2019s political campaign, and suggested they \u201cstop the back and forth by text.\u201d\n\nMASHA YOVANOVITCH\n\nThe former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was abruptly recalled to the United States in May, leaving the United States without a top-level diplomatic presence in a country on the front lines of the West\u2019s standoff with Russia.\n\nA career diplomat with the U.S. State Department who had served under Republican and Democratic administrations, Yovanovitch had been subjected to attacks by Trump supporters. Giuliani said she had been removed because she was insufficiently loyal to Trump. Democrats called her departure politically motivated.\n\nTrump called her \u201cbad news\u201d in his July phone call with Zelinskiy.\n\nMICHAEL ATKINSON\n\nAs the Intelligence Community\u2019s inspector general, Atkinson serves as the internal watchdog for intelligence agencies like the director of national intelligence and the CIA. In that role, he handled a complaint by an unidentified whistleblower who first reported concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to improperly involve Ukraine in U.S. affairs. Atkinson deemed the complaint credible, and decided that it qualified as an \u201curgent concern\u201d which by law should be shared with Congress.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nHowever, the Justice Department and the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, determined that the complaint should not be shared with lawmakers. Atkinson then notified Congress of the dispute, which ultimately led to both the complaint and the summary of Trump\u2019s July 25 call being released.\n\nAtkinson said he will fight to protect the identity of the whistleblower, who has been the subject of attacks by Trump.\n\nBefore signing on as inspector general in May 2018, Atkinson worked as a federal prosecutor specializing in corruption cases.", "description": "President Donald Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating a top rival in the 2020 U.S. presidential election prompted Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats in the House of Representatives to move ahead with an impeachment inquiry, threatening his presidency.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437263039&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9401S", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
