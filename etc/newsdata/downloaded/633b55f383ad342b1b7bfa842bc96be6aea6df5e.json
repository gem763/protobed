We both know how to hide very well, and when we have to, we do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But the fact is it\u2019s the life we\u2019ve chosen, and it\u2019s something we know.\u2019\n\nPriyanka and Nick know how to \u2018hide\u2019 well (Picture: Rex)\n\nWhich is fair enough.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re good, very busy both of us, but we\u2019re doing alright,\u2019 she continued. \u2018We\u2019re doing good.\u2019\n\nPriyanka has been spending her time shooting \u2013 and now promoting \u2013 new film, The Sky Is Pink, alongside Farhan Akhtar, Rohit Saraf and Zaira Wasim.\n\nThe movie marks her return to Bollywood after three years, and she revealed the project gave her all of the nerves \u2013 but in the best way.\n\nPriyanka Chopra made her Bollywood return with The Sky Is Pink (Picture: RSVP Movies)\n\n\u2018It was after three years that I came back to do a Hindi film, and I\u2019m just really proud that it was this one,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018I wanted to make sure that whatever movie I did was an immersive experience for me.\n\n\u2018I did Quantico for three years and played the same character, so I wanted to do something which would make me nervous, you know? And this was absolutely that.\u2019\n\nThe movie focuses on the true story of motivational speaker Aisha Chaudhary, who was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis and sadly died when she was just 18-years-old.\n\nTrust us, you\u2019ll be needing an entire box of tissues for it.\n\nAnd Priyanka, who plays Aisha\u2019s mum, Aditi, revealed she took on the role because she was \u2018inspired\u2019 by the real-life stars \u2013 who reminded her of her own parents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This is based on a real-life family, and every single scene has been told to us verbatim by them. There\u2019s nothing that has been made up or added into their story,\u2019 she explained.\n\n\u2018I found their view on life so inspiring, it reminded me of my own parents. My father always made everything into an adventure. My mother, in spite of anything that came our way, always supported my dreams and ambitions and gave me the confidence to be able have dreams and be able to achieve them.\n\nThe Sky Is Pink is released in cinemas on 11 October (Picture: RSVP Movies)\n\n\u2018With Aditi and Niren [Farhan] they both are like that. Both of them, when they couldn\u2019t even afford it for their daughter\u2019s treatment, went to London and lived there, and did whatever they needed to do to make sure their daughter got the life she did.\n\n\u2018They were told she was only going to live for five years, and she ended up living for 18.\n\n\u2018It was incredibly inspiring to me that this real-life couple, who are not superheroes or super athletes, have a super inspiring perspective on life.\n\n\u2019I think they\u2019re incredible people.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018I\u2019m super proud of being a part of that.
