The team\u2019s efforts had concentrated on identifying all of the vessels sunk during the June 1942 engagement that cost the lives of 2,000 Japanese and 300 Americans.\n\nThe expedition\u2019s director of undersea operations Rob Kraft and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson reviewed high-frequency sonar images of the warship on Sunday before asserting that its dimensions and location meant it had to be the carrier Akagi.\n\nThe Akagi was found in 5,490 metres (1,8011 ft) of water and more than 1,300 miles (2,090km) north-west of Pearl Harbor.\n\nA high-frequency sonar image of the wreck site, taken by the research vessel\u2019s underwater drone, shows the huge carrier lying broken on the sea bed amid debris, but otherwise remarkably intact.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure of what we\u2019re seeing here, the dimensions that we\u2019re able to derive from this image (are) conclusive,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cIt can be none other than Akagi.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s sitting upright on her keel, we can see the bow, we can see the stern clearly, you can see some of the gun emplacements on there, you can see that some of the flight deck is also torn up and missing so you can actually look right into where the flight deck would be,\u201d said Kraft.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photos of the sunk carrier Kaga, taken by underwater robots launched from the Petrel.

But when you see these wrecks on the bottom of the ocean and everything, you kind of get a feel for what the real price is for war,\u201d said Thompson, who is onboard the Petrel.\n\n\u201cYou see the damage these things took, and it\u2019s humbling to watch some of the video of these vessels because they\u2019re war graves.\u201d\n\nThe expedition is an effort launched by the late Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft. For years, the crew of the 76-metre (250ft) Petrel has worked with the US navy and other officials around the world to locate and document sunken ships. It has found more than 30 vessels so far.\n\n", "description": "Aircraft carriers Akagi and Kaga were sunk by US forces during second world war confrontation", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e1d9122602d5fe78463f91ea175cffef2aa63bf/0_158_2540_1524/master/2540.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=925fa3901dbb144b5ff7218fe570a5f1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
