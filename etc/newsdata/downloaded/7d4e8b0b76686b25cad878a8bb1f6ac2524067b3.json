Two others had already tied the knot, one even had a child.\n\nBut three days after Watkins, 39, returned from her two-and-a-half week honeymoon in October 2007, Yang called her into his office.\n\n\u201cAnd behind closed doors, he opined that I wouldn\u2019t want to keep working as hard as I had now that I\u2019d started this new personal chapter,\u201d she recounted. That as a married woman, I\u2019d want to focus on my new life.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd just like that, my new life was shattered. My financial security was blown to bits,\u201d she later added.\n\nWatkins was given a monthly payment plan as part of her termination, which handed down a portion of her salary over the course of two years.\n\n\u201cWe even conjured a lie about my departure, that I was willingly leaving, in order for me to save face. I was so broken, so shattered that I chose to keep a secret about my departure in order to save myself from the embarrassment.\u201d\n\nWatkins called her firing a way for Yang to \u201cget close to the exit strategy that lie ahead.\u201d Years later, Manhattan GMAT sold to Kaplan for $88 million, she said.\n\n\u201cI did not fully grasp the significance of this breach of ethics at the time and really wish that I knew then what I know now about gender issues in the workplace,\u201d she said. \u201cThe law does not protect employees from the greed of their employers, and I was a drag on Andrew\u2019s bottom line.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to HuffPost, Yang called Watkins's account \"inaccurate.\"\n\n\"As a CEO, I made decisions about hiring and firing singularly based on performance,\" he said, in part. \"During my more than a decade as CEO, I have worked with many women, married and otherwise, and value their work and dedication as important to the success of any institution. If I were the kind of leader who would do the sort of thing described by Ms. Watkins I would never enjoy a whiff of success.\"\n\nWatkins's article concluded with a call for action on gender issues, including equal pay and treatment for women \u2013 a topic that Yang has also highlighted during his campaign.\n\n\u201cAndrew Yang didn\u2019t harass me physically. But he did treat me unjustly. He violated me economically. And I am ready to fight for solutions that protect women in all areas of our lives.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe Yang campaign did not respond to FOX Business' multiple requests for comment.", "description": "\u201cDespite my hitting every single revenue mark set for me, despite not a single employment infraction over the six years, Andrew Yang fired me because I got married.\"", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/andrew-yang-AP-01.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
