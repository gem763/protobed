We\u2019re nine outs from the World Series,\u201d shortstop Trea Turner said. \u201cSix. Three.\u201d\n\nNow the Nationals get plenty of time to rest and set up their so-far terrific rotation before beginning the last series of the season against the Houston Astros or New York Yankees in a week. Houston leads the best-of-seven AL Championship Series 2-1 after winning Game 3 at New York 4-1 Tuesday.\n\nThe Nationals became the fourth team to reach the World Series after being 12 games under .500.\n\n\u201cWe think we can compete with any team, any time,\u201d NLCS MVP Howie Kendrick said. \u201cPeople always get caught up in the things that are on paper, but the reality of it is you have to go out and play. Once we get out on the field, anything can happen.\u201d\n\nThe last time the World Series came to the nation\u2019s capital, more than eight decades ago, the Washington Senators lost to the New York Giants in five games. Have to go even further back, to 1924, for the city\u2019s lone baseball championship, when the Senators defeated the Giants.\n\nThe Senators eventually left, and the town didn\u2019t have a major league team at all for more than three decades until the Montreal Expos \u2014 who were founded in 1969 and never made it to the World Series \u2014 moved to Washington in 2005.\n\nThe Nationals had never managed to advance in the postseason since arriving, going 0-4 in the NLDS over the last seven years, including three Game 5 losses at home.\n\nFirst baseman Ryan Zimmerman, the Nationals\u2019 first draft pick in Washington, was there for all of that heartache.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cyou got to wait for good things.\u201d\n\nThis month alone, the Nationals beat the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL wild-card game after trailing 3-1 heading to the eighth, and eliminated the league-best Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 5 of the NL Division Series after trailing 3-1 heading to the eighth again.\n\nThen came this lopsided dismissal of the NL Central champion Cardinals, who were outscored 20-6 in the series.\n\n\u201cOf course, we could\u2019ve played better,\u201d said St. Louis first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, who was 1 for 16 with nine strikeouts in the NLCS, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nCorbin, a left-handed pitcher signed with $140 million of the money that became available last offseason when Bryce Harper left town to join the Philadelphia Phillies, was not quite the equal of Washington\u2019s other starters in the series.\n\nStill, he did become the first pitcher to strike out 10 batters in the first four innings of a postseason game and earned the win after allowing four runs in five innings.\n\nThen Martinez turned to his NL-worst bullpen, such a problem for so much of this season.\n\nAfter Rainey got three outs, and Doolittle got five, Hudson came in for his fourth save in four chances this postseason. It wasn\u2019t easy, though: After replacing Doolittle with two outs in the eighth, Hudson hit his first batter and walked his second, bringing pinch-hitter Matt Carpenter to the plate as the go-ahead run with the bases loaded.\n\nCarpenter, a career .481 batter with the bases full, grounded out to second baseman Brian Dozier, a defensive replacement who briefly lost the ball before gathering it and throwing to first to end that inning.\n\nHudson finished things with a perfect ninth, getting Tommy Edman on a fly ball to center field to end it, and red fireworks went off around the stadium.\n\nCorbin got this evening started with a 1-2-3 top of the first, striking out all three Cardinals with a high, 95 mph fastball, a real contrast to the off-speed stuff Stephen Strasburg used for his own dozen Ks a night earlier.\n\nIn the bottom half, Washington put up those seven runs, all charged to rookie Dakota Hudson, who lasted all of 15 pitches \u2014 doing to the Cardinals what they did in the previous round, when they scored 10 to open Game 5 of the NLDS against Atlanta.\n\nAll the heartache of playoffs past seemed to dissipate during an evening that only briefly was tense for the home team and its supporters: In the fifth, a juggled Cardinals lineup finally awoke, scoring three runs \u2014 one more than the team managed to produce in Games 1-3 combined \u2014 to get within 7-4.\n\nWith a man on second and the tying run in the on-deck circle, Corbin came through, striking out St. Louis\u2019 3-4 hitters, Paul Goldschmidt and Marcell Ozuna, with sliders.\n\nAfter becoming comeback specialists, the Nationals never trailed against the Cardinals. And dating to the final week of the regular season, Washington has won 16 of its past 18 games.\n\n\u201cWe proved \u2014 and this doesn\u2019t require advanced sabermetrics,\u201d Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said, \u201cyou have to get a lead to win a game.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCardinals: Their next game will come in spring training, an exhibition at home in Jupiter, Florida, on Feb. 22.\n\nNationals: They will play Games 1 and 2 of the World Series at the AL team\u2019s stadium, because both the Astros (107) and Yankees (103) won more games than Washington\u2019s 93 in the regular season. Games 3, 4 and, if necessary, 5 will be at Nationals Park. Washington did not face either Houston or the Yankees in interleague play in 2019.\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As the Washington Nationals moved a party 86 years in the making from their ballpark's infield to a booze-filled clubhouse, manager Dave", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/2be473_aptopix-nlcs-cardinals-nationals-baseball-84689-washington-nationals-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
