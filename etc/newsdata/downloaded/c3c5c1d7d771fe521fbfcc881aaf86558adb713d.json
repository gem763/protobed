(Photo by Esmee Holdijk on Unsplash)\n\nEven if you\u2019ve never so much as a double-tapped an Instagram post, the word \u201cinfluencer\u201d probably brings to mind a certain image of a polished, posed and filtered social media star with a high follower count and a coveted blue checkmark.\n\nWith The Cut\u2019s recent expos\u00e9 revealing the dubious origins behind influencer and alleged scammer Caroline Calloway\u2019s fame, modern influencer culture is finding itself cast in an increasingly negative light. There was a time in a distant pre-Instagram world, however, when being an influencer wasn\u2019t defined by likes, hashtags, verifications or sponcon. Back in the day, \u201cinfluencer\u201d was merely a somewhat awkward verbal noun that referred more or less vaguely to \u201cone who exerts influence,\u201d as Merriam-Webster defines it.\n\nIt\u2019s this more traditional meaning that Mekanism CEO Jason Harris hopes to invoke and redefine when, in the subtitle of his new book, The Soulful Art of Persuasion, he alludes to \u201c11 habits that will make anyone a master influencer.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harris, being an influencer in today\u2019s world has nothing to do with social media starlets and brand endorsements. \u201cWhat influencer means to me,\u201d Harris tells InsideHook, \u201cis somebody who has garnered trust and reliability that people listen to and respect.\u201d\n\nTrust and respect aren\u2019t necessarily the first words that come to mind when we talk about influencer culture today, which \u2014 thanks to the editing, hidden hashtags, faux Coachella trips and carefully filtered guise of relatability influencers use to promote brands and sell products \u2014 has become an increasingly dubious world.\n\nIt\u2019s exactly this kind of skepticism, a hallmark of what Harris calls \u201cthe age of distrust,\u201d that The Soulful Art of Persuasion, out this week, hopes to cut through.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s bullshit detectors are so much higher now,\u201d says Harris, whose point is well taken. Just look at the wild skepticism that erupted last month among followers who accused a Nashville-based influencer of staging the motorcycle accident she shared on Instagram. In a world where, as Harris asserts in the opening line of his book, \u201cit\u2019s hard to know who to trust anymore,\u201d we need to rethink what it means to be persuasive.\n\nEven before the skeptical days of the Instagram influencer, persuasion was always, as Harris says, \u201ca very loaded word.\u201d Jane Austen wrote a whole book about its potential for destruction, and even today we maintain a certain, perhaps justified, wariness of those skilled in, say, \u201cthe art of the deal.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harris, however, persuasion doesn\u2019t have to be the shady, ruthless endeavor it\u2019s often made out to be. \u201cPersuasion is really about character and substance,\u201d he tells InsideHook, \u201cnot about trying to get one over on someone.\u201d\n\nContrary to popular belief, there\u2019s no dark art to being an influencer. \u201cIt\u2019s really completely the opposite,\u201d says Harris, whose vision of successful persuasion in today\u2019s world rests on the perhaps surprisingly benevolent principles of being original, generous, empathetic, and soulful. We turned to Harris for advice on how to master these principles in order to become a real modern influencer \u2014 no photoshop or brand endorsements necessary.\n\nOriginal\n\nWhile Harris maintains that his book isn\u2019t looking to turn anyone into a YouTube star, he does note that some of today\u2019s most successful social media influencers got where they are thanks to some of the same principles he highlights, especially originality.\n\n\u201cA lot of them started in their living room talking to nobody before they had fans, but they were revealing their true selves. They were being vulnerable and they were putting themselves out there,\u201d says Harris. \u201cOver time, their audience grew because they were revealing something about themselves in a public way and they were being authentically and uninhibitedly themselves.\u201d This kind of authenticity, says Harris, is the key to standing out and gaining trust among a generation of people who are no longer sold on an old-school \u201cthis is what\u2019s in it for you\u201d model of transactional persuasion.\n\nHarris positions his model of authenticity and vulnerability in contrast to the Dale Carnegie school of How to Win Friends and Influence People, which, as Harris explains, is based on the pretense of mimicking shared interests with whoever you hope to win over.\n\n\u201cToday, the way you open people up is by sharing part of yourself,\u201d says Harris. That means leaning into your quirks, interests, and even trials and failures. \u201cBy being open and vulnerable, it allows the other person to feel comfortable sharing part of themselves, and that\u2019s how a connection is made.\u201d\n\nContrary to the picture-perfect posts that have become synonymous with influencers of the social media era, real influence isn\u2019t about crafting the perfect image to appeal to an audience. \u201cIt\u2019s not closing yourself off or parroting the other person. It\u2019s the opposite,\u201d says Harris. \u201cIt\u2019s being your original self to allow the other person to also feel comfortable being themselves.\u201d\n\nGenerous\n\nWe tend to think of persuasion as a means of getting something, but Harris emphasizes that giving something is just as important. The best thing you can give someone you\u2019re hoping to persuade? Respect.\n\n\u201cRespect is really what drives people,\u201d says Harris, citing a 2014 Harvard Business Review survey of over 20,000 employees that found respect is the biggest thing people seek from their superiors in the workplace.\n\n\u201cPart of that respect is trying to look at everyone as equals and on the same level, even though their job titles might be different,\u201d says Harris. Turns out, that Golden Rule you\u2019ve been hearing about since kindergarten really does still carry weight. According to Harris, respect is as simple as being reliable, being present and treating others the way you want to be treated.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s always been easier said than done, and in the digital age, it may be even more difficult than ever. In a world where our attention is constantly being pulled in various directions, paying the respect owed to the many people that cross one\u2019s path on a daily basis requires a bit of foresight, which is why Harris recommends looking out for opportunities to take preventative action.\n\nKnow you\u2019re going to be unavailable for a period of time when a colleague might need you? Announce it beforehand with a quick email, Harris suggests. Is there a chance you may have to cut a conversation short in order to answer an urgent call from home? Be upfront with the person whose time may get cut short. Like being original, respect really just comes down to honesty.\n\nEmpathetic\n\n\u201cPersuasion isn\u2019t facts and arguments,\u201d says Harris. \u201cIt\u2019s having empathy. It\u2019s connecting with people that might not share the same views as you.\u201d\n\nEmpathy levels today may have reached an all time low. It goes without saying that you can look to the current political climate for what is perhaps the biggest example. Harris points to the major discrepancy between the results of two studies, one done in the 1960s and one done in 2016, asking Americans how they would feel if their child married someone of the opposite political party. In the initial survey, only 6 percent of Americans said they would have a problem with it. Flash forward to 2016, and that number had skyrocketed to 64 percent.\n\n\u201cThe world is a lot less trusting and a lot less connected, and we\u2019re not seeing the human commonalities that I think we had in the recent past,\u201d says Harris.\n\nFortunately, according to Harris, empathy can be cultivated. \u201cIf you\u2019re not naturally empathetic, you can develop that skill,\u201d he says, and it all starts by seeking out commonalities rather than differences. \u201cWhen you meet someone, try to find the connection point between you,\u201d he advises, rather than focusing on differences. Over time, these mental practices can lead to what Harris calls \u201ca natural curiosity\u201d about others.\n\nSoulful\n\nSoul is the final principle that separates Harris\u2019s model of persuasion from the often negative connotations it typically carries, but he\u2019s not just talking spiritual fluff.\n\nFor Harris, soulfulness is intimately tied to purpose. \u201cPart of being soulful is marrying your skill with purpose,\u201d says Harris, who encourages aspiring influencers to look for opportunities to use that conflation of skill and purpose to give back, thus inspiring and influencing others to do the same.\n\nSoulfulness, as Harris defines it, \u201cwill make you persuasive and an influencer because you\u2019re doing something positive for the world that people will admire, and it will inspire other people to do other positive things.\u201d\n\nFor Harris, persuasion isn\u2019t about bending others to your will, and being an influencer has nothing to do with racking up likes on Instagram.\n\n\u201cThere are certainly people out there that are successful by pulling fast ones, being transactional in their thinking, trying to always close deals,\u201d Harris admits. \u201cBut in the long run, that will burn out, and business and life is a marathon.\u201d By practicing an other-directed model of persuasion, says Harris, \u201cyou will become influential over the long haul because of the way you treat people and your values. You\u2019ll be ultimately an incredibly persuasive person because you\u2019ve built trust and sincerity and reliability and respect.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Mekanism CEO Jason Harris lays out the ways that you can share with followers on Instagram and Twitter without being obnoxious.", "authors": ["Kayla Kibbe"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/esmee-holdijk-i1KNK3ZFErU-unsplash.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
