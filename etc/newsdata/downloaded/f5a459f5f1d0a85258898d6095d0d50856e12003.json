That could soon change. Last month, just after the autonomous Danish territory became the focus of President Trump\u2019s real estate inquiry, visits to the tourism board\u2019s website spiked. But even before that, more travelers were starting to eyeball enigmatic Greenland, worried that its tamer rival, Iceland, was being overrun with tourists. The big draws: dramatic scenery, polar bears, northern lights and Viking settlements. The downside: Unless you\u2019re planning to arrive by cruise ship, a visit requires a little extra planning. Here\u2019s a head start:\n\n1. Factor in extra time for flights.\n\nIceland and Denmark are the only two countries offering direct flights to Greenland (which can still be hard to come by). Plan for a layover even if you\u2019re coming from nearby Canada or other Scandinavian countries.\n\n2. Coordinate all transportation in advance.\n\nWith a population of less than 60,000 and a harsh climate, Greenland has little use for roads. You\u2019ll find some (paved and not) within towns, but not connecting them. So visiting even neighboring settlements will require travel by foot, water or air.\n\n3. Pack your parka no matter when you go.\n\nWeather, even during the summer, can change quickly, an issue that climate change is exacerbating. This means a guided tour or a flight can be canceled with little notice. And while this summer brought near-record ice melt and temperatures, leaving the majority of the Greenland ice sheet exposed to above-freezing conditions, be prepared for winter conditions any time of year. In July, the hottest month, the average high in Nuuk, Greenland\u2019s largest city, hovers below 50 degrees, while falling to less than 24 degrees in February.\n\n4. Consider bunking with locals\n\nHotels exist but not many. Some enterprising Greenlanders supplement their income by hosting tourists on their property. In the south, book a farm stay. Guests at Ipiutaq\u2014the Narsaq Peninsula\u2019s most remote sheep settlement\u2014can arrange to kayak among icebergs. Look for listings at visitgreenland.com or short-term rental sites like Airbnb.", "description": "The growing curiosity about this Arctic island doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy to visit.
