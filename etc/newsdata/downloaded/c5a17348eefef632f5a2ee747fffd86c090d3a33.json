Here's how one firm claims it has reworked its business to make it work.", "language": "en", "text": "A year into the European Union rolling out the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, location data firm Factual is getting ready to expand in Europe.\n\nThe location data firm is one of a handful of advertising and marketing tech firms that shut down part of its European business ahead of the data-collection law being enforced. GDPR requires businesses to explicitly get consumers' consent before collecting their data for ad targeting. Data firms that use location stats from smartphones have been a particular target of scrutiny under the law.\n\nRead more: We got the pitch deck Foursquare is using to sell advertisers location data \u2014 even as regulation and privacy concerns mount\n\nFactual scrapped its European database and stopped offering advertisers its targeting, measurement and insight products. Developers and publishers send location data from apps to Factual that advertisers then use to create audience segments for targeting and measuring campaigns. The firm cut more than half of the providers it works with (which it didn't name) and is relaunching its products in Europe.\n\nTo spearhead the expansion, Factual hired Ross Webster as managing director of Europe. Webster was previously EMEA head of data partnerships at IBM's Watson Advertising.\n\nThe company has a small office in London with seven employees, and Ross said that by the first quarter of 2020, Factual would sell all of its products to European advertisers and operate in a handful of markets in continental Europe.\n\n\"There's a pent-up desire for quality location data within Europe,\" he said.\n\nFactual slashed its data partners\n\nThe firm has also put together a GDPR compliance program for partners, including an auditing process and new terms and agreements in contracts. Before a partner supplies location data to Factual, the company's privacy team vets a partner's process of collecting data to make sure that it meets GDPR's requirements. Partners also undergo audits on an ongoing basis, though Factual did not provide further details about the timing of audits.\n\n\"We feel like we're in a position where we can make available these three products within Europe built off of a pool of responsibly-sourced data,\" said Brian Czarny, CMO of Factual. \"We'll continue to add additional suppliers as we feel like there are others in the market that are ready to do that.\"\n\nScale is often a challenge for marketers with location-based advertising, but Czarny said that wiping its European database to build it again from scratch puts a bigger focus on collecting high-quality data.\n\n\"We don't expect for the scale to reach pre-GDPR volume,\" he said.\n\nFactual is trying to get ahead of US privacy regulation\n\nFactual said it hoped that its work over the past year would help it prepare for the forthcoming California Consumer Privacy Act (or CCPA) that takes effect in January and which will put similar restrictions to GDPR on how marketers collect and use data.\n\nA crop of privacy-minded firms are helping marketers comply with CCPA.\n\nWhile CCPA and GDPR aren't identical, both require marketers to show consumers what data they collect and delete it if a consumer requests for it to be deleted.\n\n\"What we're doing with GDPR gives us a solid foundation to be ready for upcoming regulation like CCPA,\" Czarny said.", "description": "Factual has cut down on the number of data partners it works with by more than 50 percent since GDPR rolled out last year.", "authors": ["Lauren Johnson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d77ec5f2e22af0fae3f596d-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
