Pictured, an artist's impression of a black hole\n\nThe Hawaii-based researchers were studying the so-called Friedmann's equations which mathematically describe how the universe is expanding.\n\nThey are based on Einstein's concept of general relativity \u2014 which explains how mass and energy can distort space and time.\n\nPreviously, researchers working with Friedmann's equations thought it was not necessary to factor in the internal properties of ultradense, isolated regions of space like neutron stars and black holes \u2014 instead treating matter as if spread uniformly.\n\nHowever, Professors Croker and Weiner found that these ultradense regions need to be considered, mathematically, to accurately realise their impact on the cosmos.\n\n'We showed there's only one way to [construct these equations] correctly,' Professor Croker told Live Science.\n\n'And if you do it that one way, which is the correct way to do it, you find some interesting things.'\n\n'For 80 years, we've generally operated under the assumption that the Universe, in broad strokes, was not affected by the particular details of any small region,' Professor Croker told Science Alert.\n\n'It is now clear that general relativity can observably connect collapsed stars \u2014 regions the size of Honolulu \u2014 to the behaviour of the Universe as a whole, over a thousand billion billion times larger.'\n\nInstead of containing a singularity where gravity becomes infinite, the duo argue that black holes may in fact be ultradense blobs of dark energy, which are dubbed 'Generic Objects of Dark Energy' \u2014 or GEODEs, for short.\n\nDark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that applies a negative pressure on the universe, countering the effect of gravity, explaining why the cosmos is expanding at an accelerated rate.\n\nIn the currently-accepted model, dark energy is an inherent property of space-time, and exists uniformly across the entire cosmos \u2014 rather than being concentrated in such bodies as GEODEs.\n\nThe concept of GEODEs was first put forward in 1966 by Russian physicist Erast Gliner, who proposed that they formed from the collapse of very large stars.\n\nDubbed Generic Objects of Dark Energy (GEODEs), these would look just like a black hole (pictured) but would not contain a singularity \u2014 a point where gravity becomes infinite\n\nIf GEODEs exist, they could contain all the dark energy needed to explain why the universe appears to be expanding at an accelerated rate.\n\n'If what we thought were black holes are actually objects without singularities, then the accelerated expansion of our universe is a natural consequence of Einstein's theory of general relativity,' said Dr Croker.\n\nAccording to the researchers, Friedmann's equations suggest that GEODEs gain mass over time, even when they have no material to consume, as the universe expands.\n\nA similar \u2014 but opposite \u2014 phenomenon is observed in light, which loses energy in an effect called redshift as the space through which it is travelling expands, and matter, which loses mass.\n\nWhile this effect is so small as to be nearly insignificant, such would become notable in an ultradense object like a GEODE \u2014 although, as dark energy has an opposite effect to normal energy and matter, it gains mass/energy instead of losing it.\n\n'Light is sort of a weird thing. It behaves counter-intuitively, in many ways,' said Professor Croker.\n\n'People didn't expect that this behaviour could also be exhibited in other objects. But we showed, yes, you can see it in another object.'\n\nWHAT IS DARK ENERGY? Dark energy is a phrase used by physicists to describe a mysterious 'something' that is causing unusual things to happen in the universe. The universe is full of matter and the attractive force of gravity pulls all matter together. Then came 1998 and the Hubble Space Telescope observations of very distant supernovae that showed that, a long time ago, the universe was actually expanding more slowly than it is today. The universe is not only expanding, but it is expanding faster and faster as time goes by,' Dr Kathy Romer, scientist at the Dark Energy Survey told MailOnline, as illustrated in this Nasa graphic So the expansion of the universe has not been slowing due to gravity, as everyone thought, it has been accelerating. No one expected this, no one knew how to explain it. But something was causing it. 'The universe is not only expanding, but it is expanding faster and faster as time goes by,' Dr Kathy Romer, scientist at the Dark Energy Survey told MailOnline. 'What we'd expect is that the expansion would get slower and slower as time goes by, because it has been nearly 14 billion years since the Big Bang.'\n\nAlthough GEODEs remain hypothetical, their existence would help to clear up some existing mysteries for physicist.\n\nIn 2016, for example, scientists at the US-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) reported having made the first-ever observations of two black holes merging.\n\nThey found, however, that the black holes had unexpected masses, which were either much higher or lower than they had predicted.\n\nTo account for this, the LIGO team had to place the origins of the two black holes to a region of so-called 'low-metallicity' space, with a low abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, which would make them very rare.\n\nWhere these two black holes in fact GEODEs, however, their odd masses could be explained quite simply by their having gained mass \u2014 thanks to the expansion of the universe \u2014 since their formation.\n\n'What we have shown is that if GEODEs do exist, then they can easily give rise to observed phenomena that presently lack convincing explanations,' Professors Croker and Weiner told Science Alert.\n\n'We anticipate numerous other observational consequences of a GEODE scenario, including many ways to exclude it. We've barely begun to scratch the surface.'\n\nThe unexpected masses of the merging black holes (pictured in this artist's impression) scientists spotted in 2016 would be easier to account for if the colliding bodies were instead GEODEs, Professors Croker and Weiner propose\n\nOther experts, however, remain sceptical.\n\nThe research is 'counter-intuitive and hard to digest', physicist Vitor Cardoso of Lisbon's Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico \u2014 who was not involved in the present study \u2014 told Live Science.\n\nNevertheless, Professor Cardoso reportedly found merit in exploring the possibility.\n\n'I like the idea of finding alternatives to black holes \u2014 it forces us to strengthen the black-hole paradigm,' he said.\n\n'Also, sometimes it's hard to find things if we don't look for them.'\n\nThe researchers' full findings are published in a paper in The Astrophysical Journal and in a second study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, which can be read in pre-print form on the arXiv repository.", "description": "Experts at the\u00a0University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa were studying equations which describe the universe's expansion when they found that some black holes may in fact be blobs of dark energy.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/09/19384934-0-image-a-5_1570435711179.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
