But the family loves the pool now, especially come Christmas time.\u201d\n\nIt was 18-months between inspiration striking and Mr Windell\u2019s wife and two daughters being able to swim in the bin but in that time Mr Windell also began creating Skip Pools Australia.\n\nMr Windell said the \u201crobust, strong and versatile\u201d nature of skips made them perfect for conversion into plunge pools and easy to transport.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am aware, no one is doing this at the moment and we might even be the first to do this in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Windell said the compact dimensions of the pools \u2014 4m long, 1.5m wide and either 1.2m or 1.5m deep \u2014 made them perfect for the suburban backyard.\n\nEach custom pool includes a filter, lights, steps and engineering drawings.\n\n\u201cOur company doesn\u2019t install the pools, but we do know very capable pool installers who will assist with the installation, excavation and all the other components needed for our customers to enjoy our pools,\u201d Mr Windell said.\n\nVirginia Pryor had a Skip Pool installed in the backyard of her new Burpengary East home in August.\n\nMORE: Why the trend towards \u2018spools\u2019 is heating up\n\nInside Michael Jordan\u2019s mountain mansion\n\nMedia heiress\u2019 $16 million impulse penthouse buy\n\n\u201cI recently built a new house and had a little bit of money left over that I wanted to spend on a plunge pool,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEveryone still wanted $22,000 plus for a small pool, which was out of my budget. I believe some of the cost is because if the labour and the machines needed to crane a pool in.\n\n\u201cI came across Skips Pools on Facebook and went to Hans place to check one out.\n\n\u201cIt ended up being about half the price.\u201d\n\nMs Pryor said her pool arrived at 7am one morning and was in the ground, filled with water by 6pm that night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an easy and fantastic idea. I can\u2019t believe no one has thought of it before,\u201d she said.", "description": "A Sunshine Coast father\u2019s rubbish idea has not only granted his children\u2019s swimming pool wish but also resulted in a growing small business.", "authors": ["Courtney Todd"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/23010031/capi_1ddd5d3dd8f7a6e4e63f1eafbf2daf25_7da451b9a33297b6fd9b9710ddce09b5.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
