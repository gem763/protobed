A quarter of humanity are dependent on these glaciers.\u2019\n\nDuring the tour, Kate wore a long taupe-coloured skirt and a darker coloured shirt under a leather vest for the visit, teamed with flat knee-high boots and a beige pashmina.\n\nKate and William visited a settlement of the Kalash people (Picture: WireImage)\n\nThey learned about the community\u2019s heritage (Picture: WireImage)\n\nTheir tour of Pakistan will end on October 18 (Picture: WireImage)\n\nThe duchess mingled with the locals in traditional dress (Picture: WireImage)\n\nWilliam wore a teal shirt and beige chino trousers as the pair arrived in the mountains by helicopter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir outfits were in stark contrast to their glamorous appearance at the historic Pakistan Monument in Islamabad last night, in which they arrived in an auto rickshaw.\n\nKate wore a glittering emerald dress by Jenny Packham, while William wore a traditional sherwani buttoned coat by Karachi-based designer Naushemian.\n\nDuring the evening, the duke demonstrated the UK\u2019s support for the Commonwealth country, by telling the reception they could rely on Britain as \u2018a key partner and your friend\u2019.\n\nHe then ended a speech by quoting Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the lawyer, politician and founder of Pakistan, stating: \u2018But we cannot be daunted, nor distracted.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
