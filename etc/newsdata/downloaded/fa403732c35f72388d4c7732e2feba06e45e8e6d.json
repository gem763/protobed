REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\n\u201cI just heard there\u2019s supposed to be a mass shooting tonight at the fireworks,\u201d the woman, whose name is held to protect her privacy, said in a post in a private Facebook Group with over 5,000 members. \u201cProbably just a rumor or kids trying to scare people, but everyone keep their eyes open,\u201d she said in the post, which was later deleted.\n\nThere was no shooting at the Blueberry Festival that night, and the local police said there was no threat.\n\nBut the post sparked fear in the community, with some group members canceling their plans to attend, and shows the power of rumors in Facebook Groups, which are often private or closed to outsiders. Groups allow community members to quickly spread information, and possibly misinformation, to users who trust the word of their neighbors.\n\nThese groups and other private features, rather than public feeds, are \u201cthe future\u201d of social media, Facebook Inc (FB.O) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in April, revealing their importance to Facebook\u2019s business model.\n\nThe threat of misinformation spreading rapidly in Groups shows a potential vulnerability in a key part of the company\u2019s growth strategy. It could push Facebook to invest in expensive human content monitoring at the risk of limiting the ability to post in real time, a central benefit of Groups and Facebook in general that has attracted millions of users to the platform.\n\nWhen asked if Facebook takes accountability for situations like the one in Indiana, a company spokeswoman said it is committed to maintaining groups as a safe place, and that it encourages people to contact law enforcement if they see a potential threat.\n\nFacebook Groups can also serve as a tool for connecting social communities around the world, such as ethnic groups, university alumni and hobbyists.\n\nFacebook\u2019s WhatsApp messaging platform faced similar but more serious problems in 2018 after false messages about child abductors led to mass beatings of more than a dozen people in India, some of whom have died. WhatsApp later limited message forwards and began labeling forwarded messages to quell the risk of fake news.\n\nFIREWORKS FEAR\n\nThe Blueberry Festival post caused chaos in the group, named \u201cLocal News Now 2...(Marshall and all surrounding Counties).\u201d\n\nIn another post, which garnered over 100 comments of confusion and worry, a different member urged the woman to report the threat to the police. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something to joke about or take lightly,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe author of the original post did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nFacebook\u2019s policy is to remove language that \u201cincites or facilitates serious violence,\u201d the company spokeswoman said, adding that it did not remove the post and that it did not violate Facebook\u2019s policies because there \u201cwas no threat, praise or support of violence.\u201d\n\nCheryl Siddall, the founder of the Indiana group, said she would welcome tools from Facebook to give her greater \u201ccontrol\u201d over what people post in the group, such as alerts to page moderators if posts contain certain words or phrases.\n\nBut Siddall said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s a full-time job to sit and monitor everything that\u2019s going on in the page.\u201d\n\nA Facebook spokeswoman said page administrators have the ability to remove a post if it violates the group\u2019s proprietary rules and that administrators can pre-approve individual posts, as well as turn on post approvals for individual group members.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Facebook logo is reflected in glasses in this picture illustration taken April 1, 2019. REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro/Illustration\n\nIn a post to its blog, Facebook urged administrators to write \u201cgreat group rules\u201d to \u201cset the tone for your group and help prevent member conflict,\u201d as well as \u201cprovide a feeling of safety for group members.\u201d\n\nDavid Bacon, chief of police for the Plymouth Police Department in Marshall County, said the threat was investigated and traced back to an exaggerated rumor from children. Nonetheless, he said the post to the Facebook group is \u201cwhat caused the whole problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne post grows and people see it, and they take it as the gospel, when in actuality you can throw anything you want out there,\u201d Bacon said.", "description": "Ahead of the annual Blueberry Festival in Marshall County, Indiana, in early September, a woman broadcast a warning to her neighbors on Facebook.", "authors": ["Bryan Pietsch", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439274315&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9919S", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
