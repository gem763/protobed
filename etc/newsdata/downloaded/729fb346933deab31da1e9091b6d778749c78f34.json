Do not ignore it", "language": "en", "text": "One million people receiving a text message warning them about passport renewals ahead of the Brexit deadline should note it is NOT a scam.\n\nThough it might look like one, it is a genuine dispatch from the Home Office as part of its \u2018Get Ready for Brexit\u2019 campaign \u2013 alerting people to the preparations they need to make before the UK separates from the European Union on the planned deadline of October 31.\n\nPeople who did not receive a text message in the past fortnight should still check their passport is valid for future travel beyond the start of November. This is because texts were only sent to those who provided a mobile number when they last renewed their passports.\n\nRenewing a passport can take three weeks and costs \u00a375.50 if done online\n\nIn a post-Brexit world, and in the event of a No Deal, those going abroad will need passports with at least six months remaining on them and which are less than ten years old.\n\nPrevious renewals might have added unused months from an old passport to a new one. But these \u2018extra\u2019 months won\u2019t count after October 31 \u2013 with the exception of travel to Ireland.\n\nRenewing a passport can take three weeks and costs \u00a375.50 if done online \u2013 \u00a385 via a paper application. You can also get the Post Office to \u2018check and send\u2019 a passport application to ensure it is done correctly. This includes a photo and costs an extra \u00a315.40.\n\nVisit gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew to start the process, or visit a Post Office branch that offers a \u2018check and send\u2019 service. One type of passport that may no longer be accepted is one belonging to a pet. If so, four months\u2019 forward planning is advised to arrange an official veterinary certificate for animal travel.\n\nAs well as passport preparations, travellers will need to check any insurance they have, rules for driving abroad \u2013 and phone charges applied by mobile networks for calls, texts and internet browsing while abroad.\n\nA European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) grants holidaymakers access to healthcare across Europe for the same cost as local residents \u2013 free in many cases. But this may no longer be valid after the end of the month.\n\nBrexit travel: Experts advocate the need for comprehensive travel insurance\n\nExperts advocate the need for comprehensive travel insurance. This will not only cover emergency medical bills while overseas, but also holiday cancellations, theft, and repatriation to the UK.\n\nSally Jaques, travel expert at comparison website GoCompare, says: \u2018The cover provided by an EHIC has been overestimated by many British holidaymakers. Travellers should be arranging travel insurance as soon as they book a holiday to take advantage of valuable cancellation cover.\u2019\n\nTravel insurance for most people is cheap \u2013 with the average policy for a single trip to Spain coming in at \u00a310. People with pre-existing medical conditions should use a broker to get the best deal.\n\nThe British Insurance Brokers\u2019 Association can match consumers with brokers \u2013 visit biba.org.uk or call 0370 950 1790. Those planning to drive abroad should contact their car insurer ahead of departure. Jaques adds: \u2018If the UK leaves without a deal, those driving in an EU country may need a Green Card for their car insurance to be valid.\u2019\n\nThe Association of British Insurers recommends contacting an insurance provider at least four weeks before travel to arrange such a card. An International Driving Permit might also be needed from next month if No Deal is in place. This would apply to Cyprus, France and Italy, for example.\n\nTo check whether this rule applies in a destination country, visit postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit.\n\nUsing a mobile phone abroad in Europe now costs no more than it does at home. The major mobile networks \u2013 EE, O2, Vodafone and Three \u2013 have all suggested this won\u2019t change much after Brexit, at least in the short term, but holidaymakers should contact their network for the latest advice ahead of travel. Even if charges do increase, there is an automatic \u00a345-a-month cap on internet data costs unless a customer opts out of the limit.\n\nFor details about travel in Europe post Brexit visit gov.uk/visit-europe-brexit.", "description": "One million people receiving a text message warning them about passport renewals ahead of the Brexit deadline should note it is NOT a scam.", "authors": ["Laura Shannon For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
