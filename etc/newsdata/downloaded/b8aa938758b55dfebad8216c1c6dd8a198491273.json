Customers will have the money paid direct into their bank accounts.\n\nMr Moriarty said: \u201cRefunds of bookings made by other payment methods will take longer as we do not yet have all of the information we need from Thomas Cook.\n\nOn Twitter, Gemma Adams wrote: \u201cWe were supposed to be on holiday in two weeks and now I have to wait longer to even start a claim. It\u2019s a joke honestly!\n\n\u201cPersonally I think it should be done in date order regardless of how you paid, those due to fly sooner or holidays lapsed already should receive refunds first.\u201d\n\nEven when people with forward bookings can finally apply for a refund, they may not get their money back for two months \u2013 extending almost until Christmas.\n\nThe authority has criticised Thomas Cook\u2019s management, saying the delay is \u201cdue to the poor quality of the Thomas Cook passenger data provided to the UK CAA\u201d.\n\nThe CAA chief executive said: \u201cThis will be three times larger than any refund programme we have managed before, and we are implementing new systems to enable us to process these refunds as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cWe hope to pay refunds within 60 days of receiving a valid refund form.\u201d\n\nIn previous travel-firm collapses, the CAA has told customers who paid by credit card to claim from their card provider. But banks are referring applicants back to the CAA.\n\nPassengers who bought flight-only tickets and are not covered by the Atol scheme must claim from card providers. Some travellers who paid by debit card report that they have already been reimbursed under the \u201cchargeback\u201d scheme.", "description": "One week on from the collapse of Thomas Cook, hundreds of thousands of\u00a0travellers who bought packages from the failed holiday company have been told they will have to wait another week before even beginning the refund process \u2013 with the likelihood of no money back before December.
