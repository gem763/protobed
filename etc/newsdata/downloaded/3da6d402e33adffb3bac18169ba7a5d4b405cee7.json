Luke Jumeau via split decision (29-28, 28-29, 29-28)\n\nUpdated records: Lima (15-7 MMA, 4-5 UFC), Jumeau (13-5 MMA, 2-2 UFC)\n\nKey stat: Lima outstruck Jumeau 48-30 and landed both of the fight\u2019s takedowns.\n\nLima on the fight\u2019s key moment\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more technical, but he had really good distance with his boxing. That\u2019s why I went to the kicks. I was landing my kicks and had to keep throwing them. I kept jabbing to make him back up and kick him, because he had really good distance with his hands. I knew that coming in, but he still surprised me.\u201d\n\nLima on settling for a split decision\n\n\u201cThis is the most confident I\u2019ve ever been before they announced a decision. Then they go and say 29-28 Luke and I\u2019m like, \u2018Come on!\u2019 I\u2019ve got to start finishing more fights. It sucked. I thought I clearly won.\u201d\n\nLima on what he wants next\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see who\u2019s next. I don\u2019t know yet. I want to enjoy time with my family and kids. I\u2019ll leave it in God\u2019s hands. I don\u2019t have anything planned yet.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Lima, check out the video of the full post-fight interview above.", "description": "Take a look inside Dhiego Lima's win over Luke Jumeau at UFC 243 at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, Australia.", "authors": ["Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "The Blue Corner", "Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/dhiego-lima-ufc-243-post-fight.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
