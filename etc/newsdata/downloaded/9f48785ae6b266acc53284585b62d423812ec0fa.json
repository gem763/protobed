Really interesting.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, the 33-year-old added that she\u2019d \u201cnever seen someone in the public eye handle something like this, in this way\u201d and that Degeneres\u2019 response was \u201cvery strong\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe explore this in season four of The Good Place,\u201d she wrote, according to screenshots captured by Just Jared.\n\nHowever, following criticism from her own fans, who pointed out a series of issues with Bush\u2019s legacy, including his role in starting the Iraq war and his stance against same-sex marriage, the British actress deleted her tweets and replaced them with a tweet explaining that she did not know the former president\u2019s \u201cheinous presidency\u201d.\n\n\u201cOoooof learning today about the full extent of Bush\u2019s heinous presidency...\u201c Jamil wrote. \u201cWe weren\u2019t taught much about him at school, we just heard he was stupid\u2026 (we were dealing with our own epic nightmare of a prime minister back then).\n\n\u201cWhat a monstrous leader. I now understand the rage\u2026\u201d\n\nThe response prompted scepticism among Jamil's followers, considering she would have been 14 when Bush started his presidency - an age many considered old enough to be aware of the period in US history, and the global impact it had.\n\n\u201cYou are 33 years old,\u201d one person commented, while another said: \u201cYou\u2019re 33, no? Didn\u2019t you live through it at the time?\u201d\n\nAmerican poet Saeed Jones also expressed his suspicion, writing: \u201cI grew up in Texas and I remember being aware of the role Tony Blair played in the Iraq war/ war on terror. And I was far from a newsie at the time. Anyway, keep reading up, I guess. Casually wading into high stakes convos is quite a choice.\u201d\n\nIn response to the criticism, Jamil said there were various factors that impacted her ability to learn about US politics, including growing up disabled.\n\nResponding to Jones, the actress said: \u201cI said her response was \u2018interesting\u2019. Hardly wading in much. I was also very disabled as a teen, didn\u2019t have American cable news till I was older because I was poor, and I was mentally ill and looking after a mentally ill family so struggling with a lot. But yeah ok.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 11 useful Twitter features you might not know about Show all 11 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ridiculing learning and growth is weird.\u201d\n\nHowever, after journalist Luke Bailey uncovered old tweets in which Jamil referenced Bush\u2019s presidency, the actress said she was \u201cignorant\u201d before reiterating that she knew who the former president was but \u201cdidn\u2019t learn about his treachery\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cI knew who he was. We were just told he was a fool. We didn\u2019t learn about his treachery\u2026 and since then I\u2019ve been learning about feminism and racism, because I\u2019m not a white man, and had a lot to fight *now*. Don\u2019t have as much time as you for history.\u201d\n\nJamil also said that Bailey needed to \u201cget a job\u201d, instead of searching her old tweets.\n\nThe actress concluded her thoughts on the subject in a tweet in which she explained it is \"never painful\" for her to \"learn publicly\".\n\n\"We all have more to know,\" she wrote.", "description": "Jameela Jamil is embroiled in controversy after revealing she just learned the \u201cfull extent\u201d of George W Bush\u2019s time in office, after previously defending Ellen DeGeneres for sitting next to the former US president.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/09/20/gettyimages-1138981108.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
