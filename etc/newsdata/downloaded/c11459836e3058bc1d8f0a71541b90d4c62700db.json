Mueller was said to have considered taking the post of special counsel only if he was denied a post at the FBI or justice department.\n\n\u201cThe boss and his staff do not know about our discussions,\u201d Rosenstein wrote in an email to Mueller released after a request by Judicial Watch. Rosenstein\u2019s boss was then-attorney general Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia probe, which suggests that President Trump would also not have known about the conversations.\n\nPresident Trump denied Mueller the FBI post, which led to his appointment as special counsel for the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election campaign.
