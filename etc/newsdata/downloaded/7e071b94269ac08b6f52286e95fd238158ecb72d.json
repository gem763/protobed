Simpson than Homer. But this doesn\u2019t mean that the former Steelers, Raiders, and Patriots receiver doesn\u2019t have rights.\n\nHe does, as eventually will be evidenced by the umpteen grievances he\u2019ll pursue against his two most recent teams, one or more of which (but not many) actually may prevail. He also has rights under the league\u2019s Personal Conduct Policy, rights that either will or won\u2019t be honored during the ongoing investigation sparked by last month\u2019s civil lawsuit filed against him, alleging sexual assault and rape.\n\nThere\u2019s one right he doesn\u2019t specifically have, but that all players should. Perhaps, in the next iteration of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, all players will have this right. It\u2019s basically a right to not be, for lack of a better phrase, jerked around by a process that, as a practical matter, has him essentially serving an unpaid suspension while the NFL\u2019s wheels of justice grind ever-so-slowly.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe report from earlier this week that Brown has yet to be interviewed is no surprise. The league interviews the accused as the final step of the investigation. And it\u2019s unclear what else the league is doing to get to the point that Brown\u2019s version of the events will be harvested. But it is clear that the league isn\u2019t moving with all deliberate speed to get this wrapped up.\n\nIntended or not, it\u2019s a perfect loophole to keep Brown out of the league. Although multiple teams remain interested in Brown, no one will sign Brown because the NFL won\u2019t say whether Brown is destined for the Commissioner-Exempt list, which would require his next team to pay him to not play.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo why not say so? Surely by now the NFL has enough information to determine whether Brown \u201cmay have violated\u201d the Personal Conduct Policy. If so, then he\u2019d be on the Commissioner-Exempt list if he\u2019s signed. If not, he wouldn\u2019t be \u2014 and someone would then potentially sign him and employ him until the investigation is finalized and discipline, if any, is imposed.\n\nWhile the handling of Brown doesn\u2019t amount to collusion in violation of the labor deal (e.g., the league office directing all teams not to sign a given player), it operates in the same way. Because the league won\u2019t say whether Brown will be placed on unpaid suspension while he\u2019s unemployed, no one will assume the risk of hiring him, taking the P.R. hit that would go along with it, and then having to decide whether to quickly cut him or pay him not to play, if he quickly lands on the Commissioner-Exempt list.\n\nAgain, no one is shedding tears for Brown. Even if he\u2019s not guilty of sexual assault or rape, he has said and done enough to turn most fans against him. But there\u2019s a broader principle at play here, one that can be used against any player \u2014 including players who haven\u2019t seen their image and reputation completely disintegrate.", "description": "As the Scale of Sympathetic figures go, Antonio Brown falls far closer to O.J.
