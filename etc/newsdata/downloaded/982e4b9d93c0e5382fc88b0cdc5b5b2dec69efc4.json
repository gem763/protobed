Californians brace for possible outage", "language": "en", "text": "Advertisement\n\nHundreds of thousands of Northern California residents are bracing for another possible power outage as the state's utility companies warned that a return of bad weather which could spark wildfires could prompt shut-offs.\n\nSouthern California Edison is warning it could cut power later in the week to about 132,000 customers in six counties to prevent winds from damaging electrical equipment and starting wildfires.\n\nAnd Pacific Gas & Electric says it has given 24-hour notice to customers in 16 Northern California counties that it may shut off electricity to prevent gusty winds from downing power lines and sparking wildfires. The utility says about 189,000 homes and businesses could be affected on Wednesday.\n\nPG&E says it's concerned that winds forecast to hit 60 mph could throw branches and debris into power lines or topple them, sparking wildfires.\n\nThe warnings prompted a feeling of resignation among residents and business owners, and renewed rushes to stock up on emergency supplies.\n\n'I think it's not panic per se, just 'Eh, we gotta do this AGAIN?' said Kim Schefer, manager of Village True Value Hardware in Santa Rosa.\n\nSchefer was busy Tuesday directing customers to gas cans and batteries as they prepared for what many see as a costly, frustrating new routine.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nPalisades residents flee the area as a wildfire erupts in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, Monday\n\nFirefighters watch as a helicopter drops water in a wildfire in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, Monday\n\nA firefighter gets caught off-guard by a flare up of the Palisades Fire in the Highlands neighborhood in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, Monday\n\nIt would be the second blackout in two weeks for much of the state.\n\nPG&E cut power to more than two million people across the San Francisco Bay Area in rolling blackouts from October 9-12, paralyzing parts of the region in what was the largest deliberate blackout in state history. Schools and universities canceled classes and many businesses were forced to close.\n\nAt Murphy's Irish Pub in Sonoma, co-owner Dermot Coll groaned at the thought of another power outage. The watering hole kept its doors open during the last 48-hour shut-off, but it wasn't easy because generator power to the walk-in coolers kept failing.\n\n'We made it work, but it was a headache,' Coll said. 'We kept saying, 'Is this even worth it?'\n\nColl said he fears that precautionary blackouts will become a regular occurrence now that fire season in California is a year-round phenomenon.\n\n'It's going to be an annual event, I'm afraid. I hate to say it, but I believe it's probably true,' he said.\n\nA firefighter carries a hose during work to protect homes from the flames of a wildfire in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, Monday\n\nA Los Angeles County Fire Department helicopter makes a water drop as flames from a wildfire threaten homes on a ridgeline in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles\n\nA car navigates an intersection without power in Oakland, CA, as the utility company cautions that another round of blackouts could be on the way from wildfires\n\nPG&E has cast the blackouts as a matter of public safety to prevent the kind of blazes that have killed scores of people in California over the past several years, destroyed thousands of homes, and ran up tens of billions of dollars in claims that drove the company into bankruptcy.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom sent a sharply worded letter Tuesday to Bill Johnson, CEO of the utility, blaming the unprecedented mass outage earlier this month on the company's failure to maintain and upgrade its equipment.\n\n'I believe the unacceptable scope and duration of the previous outage - deliberately forcing 735,000 customers to endure power outages - was the direct result of decades of PG&E prioritizing profit over public safety,' Newsom wrote, referring to the number of businesses and households affected, not the total number of people.\n\nPG&E says the shutdowns are not about money.\n\n'The sole intent is to prevent a catastrophic wildfire,' Johnson said in a Monday briefing.\n\nA huge portion of California is under high fire risk amid unpredictable gusts and soaring temperatures.\n\nRestaurant owners in Oakland, CA get comfortable with candles and flashlights amid rolling blackouts on October 9\n\nA man buys fuel for his camp stove at a Santa Rose, CA hardware store that is without electricity on October 9.
