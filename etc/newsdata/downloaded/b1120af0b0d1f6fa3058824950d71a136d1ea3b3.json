Go-go history and music could be required in schools. I envision a Chuck Brown Endowed Chair in Digital and Cultural Studies, funding doctoral and postdoctoral fellowships dedicated to studying go-go music and culture.\n\nThe city should consider the economic benefits of investing in go-go the same way it has invested in say, baseball. In the early 2000s, Nashville branded itself \u201cMusic City\u201d and invested in work force training in the music hospitality industry. In just 15 years, the city\u2019s music tourism revenues went from $3 billion to $7 billion. Today one-third of all visitor spending in the state of Tennessee comes from music.\n\nThis new legislation could cement go-go\u2019s rightfully central place in urban culture and history. It has the potential to invest and integrate native Washingtonians into the changes and economic expansion sweeping across the city in a way we have not seen. Of course the music is just the beginning of what needs to be done to push back on the displacement and cultural erasure steamrollering across Washington and so many other urban centers across the United States that are not far behind. With that in mind, those of us in the Don\u2019t Mute DC collective of cultural activists have developed an anti-displacement and arts preservation platform, and we\u2019re organizing our neighbors around these issues in advance of the next legislative cycle. But a powerful start is to make sure go-go culture will, as Councilman McDuffie put it, \u201cnever be muted in the District of Columbia.\u201d\n\nI thought of the 1838 enslaved Jamaican this month when my husband and I hosted our 19th annual Howard University Homecoming celebration at our home in the district. We hired a local go-go band, Persevir, to perform. We tried to prepare our new neighbors by reaching out on local listservs and social media platforms to tell them about the party. We invited them to join us to grab a plate and encouraged them to call us and not the police if they had any problems with the noise. But not 10 minutes after the band concluded its performance, officers paid our house a visit, saying they\u2019d received multiple complaints.\n\nLike the Jamaican before me who rejected the attempts to quiet his music, I was not having it. If Mr. McDuffie\u2019s bill becomes law, perhaps the rest of the city won\u2019t either.\n\nNatalie Hopkinson is the author of \u201cGo-Go Live: The Musical Life and Death of a Chocolate City.\u201d\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
