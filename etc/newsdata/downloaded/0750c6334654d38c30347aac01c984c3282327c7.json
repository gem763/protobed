In 2017, the Bitcoin community split into two: BTC and Bitcoin Cash(BCH). BCH is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo potential conflict of interest\u201d\n\nIn the paragraph regarding BCH-1FD\u2019s team size and whether some contributors are involved in other crypto projects, CZ noted that Binance will provide conversion between BCH and BCH-1FD through deposit/withdraw. As such, \u201cthere isn\u2019t much development work in this token or any potential of conflict of interest,\u201d Zhao concluded.\n\nPer the proposal, users will be able to swap the token for native BCH on Binance.com. Currently, the total circulating supply of BCH-1FD amounts to 5,000 BCH, but could be increased in the future, the post states:\n\n\u201cBEP2 BCH is mintable, and the total supply will increase as market demands. All the issued BEP2 BCH will be backed 1:1 by native BCH sitting in a publicly disclosed reserve address that can be monitored by anyone at all times.\u201d\n\nParallel to his BCH-1FD project, CZ also proposed to list two new trading pairs with Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin on the DEX: Bitcoin (BTC)/BUSD and XRP/BUSD.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported previously, CZ had recently stated that the reasons why Binance Coin (BNB) dropped over 50% from its all-time high in June do not \u201cmake much sense.\u201d", "description": "Decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Binance DEX is preparing to list BCH-1FD, a pegged token that tracks the value of Bitcoin Cash", "authors": ["Liam Frost"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZjkzMTNkNGRjMjVkNGNlYzE5NWJhNTc3ZmQ2NDQzZmQuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
