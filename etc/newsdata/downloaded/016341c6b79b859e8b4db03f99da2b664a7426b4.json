That's the amount Everton have spent on new players since Marco Silva arrived in the summer of 2018 and yet they could finish this weekend in the bottom three.\n\nLast season, Everton won 5-1 at Turf Moor but this time it was disaster everywhere you looked. Skipper Seamus Coleman was sent off for the first time since 2011 and Jeff Hendrick's volleyed winner represented the 21st goal the visitors have conceded from a set piece under Silva.\n\nWhile Burnley's unbeaten run has now stretched to four matches and temporarily moved them up to fourth, Everton are still seeking their first league win outside Goodison Park since March.\n\nMarco Silva now faces huge pressure to keep his job as Everton manager after another loss\n\nSeamus Colelman was sent off by referee Graham Scott during the second half at Turf Moor\n\nHendrick scored the only goal of the game after Everton went down to ten men on Saturday\n\nJeff Hendrick (L) celebrates after putting his side in the lead in the second half at Turf Moor\n\nMATCH FACTS Burnley (4-4-2): Pope 6; Lowton 7, Tarkowski 6.5, Mee 7, Pieters 6.5 (Taylor 55 6.5); Gudmundsson 6 (Lennon 84), Hendrick 7, Westwood 6.5, McNeil 7.5; Wood 6, Barnes 6 (Rodriguez 73 6) Subs unused: Hart (GK), Long, Brady, Vydra Goal: Hendrick 72 Booked: Hendrick, Westwood Everton (4-2-3-1): Pickford 6; Coleman 5, Keane 6, Mina 6, Digne 6.5; Schneiderlin 6 (Gomes 84), Delph 6.5; Richarlison 6, Sigurdsson 6 (Sidibe 59 6), Iwobi 6.5; Calvert-Lewin 6 (Kean 74 6) Subs unused: Lossl (GK), Holgate, Bernard, Davies Sent off: Coleman Booked: Sidibe Referee: Graham Scott Attendance: 20,650\n\nNot great considering their forwards included \u00a350million Richarlison and a \u00a336million substitute Moise Kean, whereas Burnley have never spent more than \u00a315million on any player.\n\nDisgruntled away fans shouted at director of football Marcel Brands to sack Silva as he trooped past them on his way to the away dressing-room. To Silva's credit, he also went to applaud the visiting support at the final whistle, even though some of his players didn't.\n\n'I understand 100 per cent why the supporters are angry with us. I understand their feeling, it was not a moment to go straight to the dressing-room but to listen to how they feel.\n\n'No doubt they have a right to be angry with myself and the team. It is up to us to work harder, to be braver, to be more clinical. Our front players have to be more assertive because we did get in dangerous positions but of course our confidence is not the best.\n\n'The next game is a must-win for us. We have to play with more confidence.'\n\nFor now, Silva must hope he gets the next game, against West Ham on October 19. There was no indication from the club after the game of an immediate sacking but the international break is always a dangerous time for managers and four defeats in a row is not good.\n\nWin moves Burnley into the top four for time being - they are undefeated in four league games\n\nEngland No 1 Jordan Pickford conceded again at Turf Moor after much recent scrutiny\n\nThey stand a point ahead of the relegation zone and will fall into it if Newcastle defeat Manchester Untied on Sunday.\n\nAs for Burnley, another hard-fought win temporarily lifted them to the giddy heights of fourth.\n\n'When our game isn't as technically pure as it could be, there is a shape and energy about our team and a relentless nature trying to win the game,' said Burnley manager Sean Dyche.\n\n'Our goalkeeper and two centre-halves were outstanding and it was a great finish for the goal. Roughly 25 or 30 per cent of goals are still scored from set pieces. The details we work on are important.'\n\nEverton forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin couldn't find his way past a resolute Burnley defence\n\nEverton shaded a poor first half with Alex Iwobi and Dominic Calvert-Lewin failing with the best openings but the touchpaper was really lit just before the interval when Coleman slid in for a tackle and his follow through caught Erik Pieters on the right shin.\n\n'It wasn't a great challenge and probably a red in the modern day,' said Dyche, but Coleman escaped on that occasion with a yellow.\n\nHis luck turned however after 56 minutes when he jumped into Dwight McNeil by the halfway line, winded the Burnley winger and got his marching orders for a second caution.\n\nThis time it was Silva who was irked. 'The second yellow looked a really harsh decision and had a big impact on the game,' he said. Then again, the Everton manager said he hadn't seen the earlier challenge that Coleman had made.\n\nIt was the Irishman's first dismissal for Everton since facing Chelsea eight years ago.\n\nBurnley striker Chris Wood missed out on scoring in three consecutive Premier League games\n\nSeason at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, Burnley struggled to make the extra man count. 'It can be tricky,' admitted Dyche. But ultimately they exploited Everton's weakness at defending corners after 72 minutes.\n\nAshley Westwood drove a cross beyond the far post and with no Everton defender rushing outside the box to block, Hendrick was unmarked to lash home his shot.\n\nOnce ahead, you never felt Burnley would relinquish. Silva sent on creative midfielder Andre Gomes near the end to try and conjure up a late equaliser but it was more likely Burnley would add a second with McNeil and Jay Rodriguez leading exciting counters.\n\nSilva took his medicine by going over to the Everton fans at the end and tried to be as upbeat as he could in his post-match press conference.\n\n'No doubt we can turn this around. I have the same faith in what we are doing,' he said. 'We need results. We must win the next game. But we had worse times than this last season and reacted.'\n\nTruth is, he looked a bit lonely, a losing manager isn't someone surrounded by well-wishers. 'I respect every manager. It's a tough job,' sympathised Clarets boss Dyche. He himself has suffered the pain of relegation but is now sitting high in the Premier League.", "description": "JOE BERNSTEIN AT TURF MOOR: You don't get much for \u00a3200milion these days.
