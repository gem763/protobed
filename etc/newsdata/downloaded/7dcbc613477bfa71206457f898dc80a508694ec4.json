Studies generally find that parents don\u2019t vote at any higher a rate than non-parents, nor are they more alarmed about climate change than non-parents.\n\nThere are some signs, however, that parents and millennials could be persuaded to act. For one, there are significant generational differences, even crossing party lines, around specific climate questions such as fossil fuel use. There is also some evidence that parents think and behave differently regarding climate change when reminded that they are, in fact, parents. Performing doctoral research at Duke University, Emily Pechar Diamond found , in an experiment , that prompts emphasizing people\u2019s parental identity rather than their partisan identity made participants significantly more open to changing their minds or taking climate-related actions. Other research has shown that while parents are no better than nonparents at quantifying the risks of climate change (hence their lack of alarm), they are more emotionally responsive when primed to consider the risk; since politics follows emotions, this is promising.\n\nUniversity of Washington philosophy professor Stephen Gardiner has theorized that there is a \u201cperfect moral storm\u201d fueling a lack of action on climate change: Because those with the most power to change things lack incentives to do so, \u201cthe current generation, and especially the most affluent, are in a position to pass on most of the costs of their behavior (and especially the most serious harms) to the global poor, future generations and nonhuman nature.\u201d It\u2019s a dilemma today\u2019s generation of parents, with an intense interest in their children\u2019s welfare, are better poised to elude than most groups.\n\nAnd millennial parents\u2019 potential power is tremendous. In the U.S. alone, there are well more than 20 million millennial parents. Our ranks are growing daily. By 2020, millennials be the largest adult generation in the nation. Add in our parenting compatriots from around the globe, and that\u2019s an international force to be reckoned with.\n\nSo: Let\u2019s stop trying to sell people only on the altruistic side of fighting climate change\u2014the opportunities to shrink economic inequalities, improve everyone\u2019s quality of life, and generally better society. A good climate plan is likely to do all that. But this is not about altruism. For millennial parents, this is personal, as personal as it gets:\n\nOur kids will suffer.\n\nIt will be our fault.\n\nAnd we will be around to watch it happen.\n\nOur children\u2019s hardship will be our fault not because we used plastic straws or slacked on recycling, but because we stood by as profit-driven corporations continued pell-mell down the path of destruction, and as our political leaders failed to act. It will be our fault because we didn\u2019t flex our political or consumer muscle to collectively lift the oil tanker poised to crush our children. Ten or twenty or one hundred million parents worldwide holding hands and jumping at the same time can create an earthquake powerful enough to reshape the economic and political topography.\n\nMillennial parents need to be the first in line, our hands raised high, providing political cover and electoral backup so our elected leaders can make the difficult decisions that need to be made. Those could include, per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and others, an emissions trading system, huge investments in renewable energy and electrification, quickly ending subsidies for coal and other fossil fuels, building out infrastructure for items like clean transportation and pro-forestation food systems, and aiding the developing world in growing sustainably. Some of this will require tax increases and other forms of temporary pain, the needle-prick of a medicinal injection. But what is parenthood if not absorbing temporary pain in pursuit of long-term flourishing?\n\nMillennial parents also need to consider the effect of climate change on their children when voting in 2020: Whoever sits in the Oval Office afterwards will have an enormous amount of influence over some critically consequential international climate summits. Whether Democrat or Republican, we all love our children and want a better future for them. So regardless of whether a parent sees value in smaller government or falls into the anti-abortion camp, we need to be clear that, going by his disastrous climate denialism and actions thus far, a vote for Donald Trump in 2020 is a vote for a future in which our children will struggle. Democratic parents griping about the eventual nominee and who don\u2019t help get out the vote\u2014or who fail to vote at all\u2014are making the same choice.\n\nParents need to start prioritizing their children\u2019s welfare at the ballot box, even if the candidate wouldn\u2019t have otherwise been their top pick. The Millennial Parent Pledge should start with a single promise: For the sake of our children, every one of us will vote in every election from here on out, asking every time whether candidates\u2019 climate plans are good enough for our kids. We must strive as if our children\u2019s future depends on it, because it does. Everything else is noise.", "description": "Parents of young kids need to get serious about climate change.
