It was really just sharing our experience, which obviously is pretty unique.\u201d\n\nRepublicans must follow Ardern\u2019s lead and stand up to the gun lobby | Dani Garavelli Read more\n\nNew Zealand earned international praise for its swift response to the Christchurch massacre, in which a lone gunman killed 51 people and injured dozens more at two mosques in the city.\n\nDays after the shooting, Ardern announced that most semi-automatic weapons would be banned. Weeks later, the country\u2019s parliament overwhelmingly passed a law outlawing certain semi-automatics and compelling owners of such weapons to hand them over as part of the nation\u2019s gun buyback program. So far, owners have returned as many as 15,000 banned firearms.\n\nBy contrast, a summer of carnage in the US \u2013 punctuated by mass shootings in El Paso, Texas; Midland and Odessa, Texas; and Dayton, Ohio \u2013 has prompted calls for sweeping gun reforms but so far no action by its politicians.\n\nGun buyback programs have always been controversial in the US, even among Democrats who near uniformly support strengthening the nation\u2019s gun laws. But the Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke has shifted the debate with his vow to take away the millions of AR-15 and AK-47 rifles in possession.\n\nTrump has at times expressed support for expanding background checks for firearm purchases \u2013 only to walk it back under pressure from Republicans and the National Rifle Association.\n\nGun control was only a part of what Ardern described as a \u201cwide-ranging\u201d conversation with the US president, which also touched on trade, tourism and national security.\n\nA readout from the White House press secretary, Hogan Gidley, made no mention of their discussion about the gun buyback program.\n\n\u201cThe two leaders discussed a variety of bilateral issues, including the United States steadfast support for New Zealand after the Christchurch attack,\u201d according to the readout. \u201cThe president expressed continued support for the sentiment behind the Christchurch Call to Action and vowed to continue partnering with New Zealand to counter online violent extremism.\u201d\n\nIn May, Ardern convened the Christchurch Call to Action summit in Paris, where she and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, convened world leaders and global tech giants in an attempt to strengthen efforts to combat online extremism. At its conclusion, the leaders and tech companies signed a pledge to \u201celiminate terrorist and violent extremist content online\u201d. The US declined to attend and is not a signatory of the pledge.\n\nThere was also some dispute between the countries about what to call their meeting. Trump\u2019s public schedule labeled it a \u201cpull aside\u201d while Ardern referred to it as a \u201cbilateral\u201d. Trump\u2019s one-on-ones with the presidents of Pakistan, Poland, Egypt and Singapore were described as \u201cbilateral meetings\u201d.\n\nAfter the meeting, Ardern downplayed the discrepancy, and noted that the two leaders had spoken for roughly 25 minutes and that Trump\u2019s \u201cwarmth and high regard\u201d for New Zealanders shone through in their conversation.\n\nShe added that he had a \u201cgood knowledge and understanding\u201d of the country and some of the \u201cbig personalities that have come out of New Zealand\u201d.\n\nPressed for details on who Trump had mentioned, Ardern divulged only one name: the left-handed golfing legend Bob Charles.\n\n", "description": "Prime minister says she and Trump discussed her country\u2019s reforms on sidelines of UN general assembly", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c5f198211a99717fa00b1e947df7b69735b8b0d/0_124_4043_2426/master/4043.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c89c54475b6f38c68ab56d5187dfd111", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
