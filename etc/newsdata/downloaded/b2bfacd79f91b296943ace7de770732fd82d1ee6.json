Sadly, he choked!' Trump wrote.\n\n'Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous \"a**\" who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn\u2019t give it to him). He is so bad for R\u2019s!' Trump continued.\n\n'If Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked!' Trump wrote in a tweet on Saturday blasting Republican Senator Mitt Romney. Trump is seen right on Saturday as he returns to the White House after playing golf in his Virginia club nearby\n\nIn 2016 (above), Romney lobbied Trump for the secretary of state role after savagely criticizing him during the election. Trump rejected him but later endorsed Romney for senate\n\nTrump continued his attack later Saturday, claiming the people of Utah were considering their vote for Romney a 'mistake,' and calling for him to be impeached.\n\nRomney, the Republican Party's failed 2012 nominee for president, publicly condemned the president's actions in a pair of tweets on Friday, after a whistle-blower blew the lid off Trump's requests to get Ukraine to probe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nHis criticism, among the first public condemnation of the president's actions by a Senate Republican, came as some congressional Republicans have rallied around Trump, with many more remaining silent during a congressional recess.\n\n'When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China's investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,' Romney wrote Friday.\n\n'By all appearances, the President's brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,' he added.\n\nTrump, who is spending the weekend in Washington DC with no public events on his schedule, also fired off tweets criticizing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment probe.\n\n'The so-called Whistleblower\u2019s account of my perfect phone call is \u201cway off,\u201d not even close,' Trump wrote.\n\n'Schiff and Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise, they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people!'\n\nTrump also also fired off a tweet criticizing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (both seen above on Friday)\n\nHe also lashed out at the press, writing: 'The Media is \u201cFixed\u201d and Corrupt. It bears no relationship to the truth. The @nytimes & @washingtonpost are pure fiction. Totally dishonest reporting!'\n\nRomney had earlier surprised political observers last month with a tweet that also raised serious concerns about new disclosures about the president's July phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskey.\n\n'If the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,' Romney wrote then. He hasn't tweeted about the issue since.\n\nNebraska GOP Sen. Ben Sasse condemned Trump's remarks Thursday night. 'Hold up: Americans don't look to Chinese commies for the truth. If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that's a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps,' he told the Omaha World-Herald.\n\nAnother former GOP presidential candidate, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, dismissed Trump's comments on the White House South lawn Thursday that Ukraine and China should investigate Biden.\n\n'I don't think it's a real request,' Rubio said in Florida Friday, speculating that Trump may have been trying to get a rise out of reporters.\n\n'I don't know if that's a real request or him just needling the press knowing you guys were going to get outraged by it. He's pretty good at getting everyone fired up and the media responded right on task,' Rubio said.\n\nIowa Sen. Joni Ernst defended a whistle-blower who brought forward a complaint about Trump's Ukraine request \u2013 even as she faced down an Iowa voter at a town hall by asking: 'Where is the line.'\n\nPresident Trump publicly asked Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens Thursday\n\nPresident Trump pushed Ukraine to probe the Bidens\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden attend an NCAA basketball game between Georgetown University and Duke University in Washington, U.S., January 30, 2010. Obama defeated Romney in 2012\n\n'Whistleblowers should be protected,' Ernst said. 'I stand with [Iowa Senator] Chuck Grassley on this. We have laws in place,' she said.\n\nBut she stopped short of condemnation of the president's conduct. 'The president is going to say what the president is going to do. It's up to us as members of the Congress to continue working with our allies making sure that we remain strong in a face of adversity,' she said, NBC reported.\n\nIf the House votes to impeach Trump, the articles of impeachment would then face what amounts to a trial in the Senate, where two-thirds senators would need to vote to convict for him to be removed from office.\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, House Democrats on Friday demanded Ukraine-related documents from Vice President Mike Pence. They asked for what information he was provided about Trump's July 25 call with the Ukrainian president, and about the whistle-blower's claim that his own trip to President Zelensky's inauguration was nixed amid the push for the probe of the Bidens.\n\nTrump said Thursday that if Ukraine 'were honest about it,' it 'would start a major investigation against the Bidens. It's a very simple answer.'\n\n'Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens,' Trump insisted, 'because what happened with the Bidens in China is just about as bad.\n\n'President Zelensky \u2013 if it were me I would recommend they start an investigation into the Bidens because nobody has any doubt that they aren't crooked,' he added, speaking of the president of Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Trump predicted he would prevail in any impeachment trial in the Senate, where the GOP has control.\n\n'They're all in line,' he said of House Democrats. 'Because even though many of them don't want to vote, they have no choice. They have to follow their leadership. And then we'll get it to the Senate, and we're going to win,' he predicted.\n\nThe brushback from Romney came as Trump once again defended his comments about seeking assistance from Ukraine to investigate his rival \u2013 after tweeting that he has an 'absolute right' to do so.\n\nTrump said he had an 'obligation' to request assistance from foreign governments to investigate alleged corruption and asks he made of China and Ukraine were not politically motivated in any way.\n\n'As President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!' Trump tweeted Friday.\n\nHe had earlier suggested on that China showered $1.5 billion on Hunter Biden in order to influence his father and win favorable trade deals with the United States.\n\nThe president on Friday insisted that the foreign investigations he's demanding are about Hunter Biden 'pillaging these countries and hurting us,' not his father's bid to become the next President of the United States.\n\nHe couldn't provide an example when asked of a time he asked a foreign government to investigate anyone who wasn't a political opponent.\n\n'You know, we would have to look,' Trump said.\n\nAsked if he would cooperate with House investigators as the demand documents, Trump responded: 'I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s up to the lawyers.'\n\nTrump also said his push for Biden probes was not linked to a China trade deal, a meeting at the White House for the Ukrainian president or a belief he could lose the 2020 presidential election to Barack Obama's vice president.\n\n'Everything to me is about corruption. We want to find out what happened with 2016,' he said. 'I don\u2019t care about Biden\u2019s campaign. But I do care about corruption. His campaign, that's up to him.'\n\nUkraine's Prosecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka said he would reopen a number of cases, including one dealing with the company where Hunter Biden served on the board\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that both Ukraine and China should probe possible corruption by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden\n\nTrump's defense of his conduct, which has accelerated a Democratic impeachment inquiry, came as Ukraine\u00b4s Prosecutor General said on Friday that his office would review the case of an energy company linked to Hunter Biden.\n\nThe prosecutor said he is reviewing all the cases that were closed by his predecessors \u2013 including several related to the owner of gas company Burisma Holdings where former Vice President Joe Biden\u00b4s son sat on the board of directors and was reportedly compensated $50,000 a month.\n\nThe developments in Ukraine come after newly-revealed Ukraine texts show Trump administration officials discussing efforts to get a probe and push a set of talking points \u2013 including by leveraging a presidential visit.\n\nUkrainian prosecutor Ruslan Ryaboshapka told reporters in Kyiv that prosecutors are auditing all the cases that were closed or dismissed by former prosecutors, including several related to Mykola Zlochevsky, owner of the gas company Burisma that hired Hunter Biden in 2014, at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u00b4s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv.\n\nThough the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.\n\n'We are now reviewing all the cases that were closed or split into several parts or were investigated before, in order to be able to rule to reverse those cases where illegal procedural steps were taken,' Ryaboshapka said.\n\nAsked by The Associated Press about Trump\u00b4s comment Thursday that the U.S. has an 'absolute right' to ask foreign leaders to investigate corruption cases, Zelensky said that Ukraine is 'open' and that all the cases under investigation are 'transparent.'\n\nThe Prosecutor General\u00b4s Office later said that among the cases they are reviewing, there are 15 where Zlochevsky is mentioned. None of the Zlochevsky-related cases has been revived yet, they said.\n\nThey did not specify how many, if any, were related to Hunter Biden\u00b4s work at Burisma.\n\nRyaboshapka was mentioned in the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who assured Trump that Ryaboshapka was 'his man' and that he would resume investigations into Burisma.\n\nThe prosecutor general insisted on Friday that he did not feel any pressure over the Burisma case.\n\n'Not a single foreign or Ukrainian official or politician has called me or tried to influence my decisions regarding specific criminal cases,' he said.\n\nA whistleblower last month revealed that Trump in a phone call asked Zelensky to resume the probe into Joe Biden and his son. The July 25 call has since triggered an impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\nThe newly-announced action in Ukraine comes amid additional revelations about Trump administration efforts to push an investigation \u2013 including by leveraging a presidential visit.\n\nTrump 's aides told the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden and the 2016 election if he wanted a visit to Washington, 23 pages of texts released by Adam Schiff and House Democrats revealed.\n\nKurt Volker, Trump's former envoy to Ukraine, told an aide to Zelensky that the U.S. would only 'nail down' a date once the Ukrainian president promised to 'get to the bottom of what happened' - reference to an unproven theory Joe Biden, as vice president, interfered in a Ukrainian investigation into a gas company that had Hunter Biden on its board.\n\nDonald Trump (pictured in Florida yesterday) admits he told Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, but has repeatedly denied pressuring Ukraine with a 'quid pro quo'\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff released the texts late Thursday\n\nCharge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine William Taylor voiced concerns about pressuring Ukraine, writing: 'This is my nightmare scenario'\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who was appointed by Trump to his job, is one of key players in the text exchanges\n\nScroll down to read all 23 pages of texts\n\nVolker sent the text, released late Thursday night, just hours before the phone call between Trump and Zelensky that sparked the impeachment probe.\n\nThe tranche of texts - handed over by Volker as part of his testimony to lawmakers in their impeachment inquiry of Trump - revealed the pressure the president's aides put on the Ukraine to give credence to an unsubstantiated theory of corruption on the part of Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nBiden is not mentioned by name in them but the subtext is clear and Democrats used the texts to argue they show Trump put pressure on a foreign power to target a domestic political rival.\n\nMentioned in the texts is Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney who has been one of the biggest advocates of the Biden theory and, at one point, had talked of going to the Ukraine to investigate it.\n\n'It's been mischaracterized,' he told Fox News Thursday night of the texts.\n\nZelensky's government ultimately never released the statement on the 2016 election and Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden sat on the board, that the Trump aides pushed for.\n\nBut such a statement would have given the president political fire to use against his opponent without having his fingerprints on its origins.\n\nScroll down to read all 23 pages of texts\n\nTrump argued Friday morning his target was corruption, not the Bidens.\n\nTrump admits he told Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, but has repeatedly denied pressuring Ukraine or offering a quid pro quo.\n\nOn Friday morning, after the texts had been released, the president argued he was fighting 'corruption' and not conducting a political campaign against the Biden.\n\n'As President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!,' he wrote on Twitter.\n\nHowever, Democrats will seize on the new messages as evidence that Trump's aides explicitly linked Ukraine's investigation to a visit to Washington.\n\nThe texts also reveal that U.S. Ambassador William Taylor voiced concerns about pressuring Ukraine, calling it 'my nightmare scenario.'\n\nVolker, who resigned from his part time State Department job last week, gave evidence to lawmakers in an eight-hour session behind closed doors on Thursday.\n\n'Heard from White House - assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck!' Volker wrote in the July 25 message - sent before Trump's phone call with Zelensky.\n\nHe sent the text to Andrey Yermak, an aide of Zelensky's who later responded that the 'phone call went well'.\n\nDays earlier, on July 19, after he had breakfast with Giuliani, Volker told Sondland the 'most important thing' in the call was for Zelensky to 'say that he will help investigation'.\n\nVolker and fellow diplomats also discussed a draft statement in which Ukraine would announce a probe into Burisma Holdings and Joe Biden's request - made in 2016 when he was vice president - that the Ukrainian government remove a prosecutor who was accused of not prosecuting corruption cases in the country. The International Monetary Fund and European diplomats also pushed for the prosecutor to be ousted.\n\nTrump's former envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker departs following his closed-door testimony yesterday during which he handed over a tranche of texts which were released last\n\nKurt Volker sent this text, released by House Democrats in a 23-page tranche last night, just hours before the phone call between Trump and Zelensky which is at the center of the impeachment probe\n\nTrump argued Friday morning his target was corruption, not the Bidens\n\nHowever, on August 10 Yermak demanded that Zelensky's trip to Washington D.C. be confirmed before they released a statement, saying 'it will be logic [sic] to do after we receive a confirmation of date'.\n\nThe Players in the Texts Ambassador Kurt Volker: former special representative for Ukraine Negotiations; Volker testified for eight hours behind closed doors to lawmakers on Thursday and provided the text messages William B. Taylor: Charge d'Affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine; a career State Department employee, he was the top American diplomat in Ukraine after the Trump administration forced out Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch Gordon Sondland: U.S. Ambassador to European Union; he's also a prominent Republican fundraiser and donor who gave $1 million to Trump's inauguration committee; Trump appointed him to his ambassador job Andrey Yermak: top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Rudy Giuliani: Personal lawyer to President Donald Trump\n\n'Once we have a date we will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship , including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations,' Yermak wrote.\n\n'Sounds great!' texted Volker.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who was appointed by Trump to his job, is one of key players in the text exchanges\n\nCharge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine William Taylor voiced concerns about pressuring Ukraine, writing: 'This is my nightmare scenario'\n\nTrump and his allies claim Biden, when he was vice president, pressured the Ukrainian government to fire the country's top prosecutor to protect his son Hunter and Burisma Holdings, which was accused of corrupt practices.\n\nThere has been no evidence of illegal activity or wrongdoing in Ukraine by the Bidens and there are reports Trump's own advisers warned him the theory was incorrect.\n\nTrump has demanded a probe into the Bidens anyway.\n\nUkraine's new top prosecutor said this week his office was reviewing a number of cases related to Burisma.\n\nHowever, he said he was not aware of any wrongdoing by Hunter Biden and had not been contacted by any foreign lawyers about the case.\n\nThe proposed investigation would also have looked at unsubstantiated allegations that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 race on behalf of Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to the texts, Volker, Sondland and William 'Bill' Taylor, the charge d'affaires at the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, discussed the statement Zelensky would issue in support of the investigation.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff released the texts late Thursday\n\nDonald Trump (pictured in Florida yesterday) admits he told Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, but has repeatedly denied pressuring Ukraine with a 'quid pro quo'\n\nThe 23 pages of texts released by Democratic House committee chairmen last night\n\nRudy Giuliani is mentioned several times in the text exchanges\n\nAs the negotiations progressed, Sondland said Trump 'really wants the deliverable,' referring to Ukraine's commitment to conduct the investigation.\n\nThen, Trump froze nearly $400million in U.S. military assistance to Ukraine shortly before speaking to Zelensky.\n\n'Need to talk with you,' Yermak wrote to Volker on August 28 when the news of freeze broke.\n\nTaylor, the seasoned top diplomat in the Ukrainian embassy and a career State Department employee, conveyed his concerns and questioned whether the money was being withheld until Ukraine agreed to Trump's demand.\n\n'Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?' he wrote on September 1.\n\nSondland, a Trump appointee, quickly moved the conversation from texting to a phone call.\n\n'Call me,' Sondland replied.\n\nBut as Trump never committed to a meeting with Zelensky and U.S. aid to the country was on hold, the texts reflected diplomatic concerns.\n\nTaylor had earlier warned Sondland earlier that Zelensky was 'sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, re-election politics.'\n\n'The message to the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is key. With the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. Thus my nightmare scenario,' Taylor wrote to Sondland on September 9.\n\n'As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,' he added.\n\n'The president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind,' Sondland replied. 'The president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that president Zelensky promised during his campaign I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.'\n\nGiuliani appeared numerous times in the 23-page tranche, put in touch with Yermak by Volker in a text on July 19.\n\nVolker also sought Giuliani's advice on the statement that Zelensky should make about the investigation.\n\n'Can we all get on the phone to make sure I advise Z correctly as to what he should be saying? Want to make sure we get this done right,' Volker wrote on August 9.\n\n'Yes can you call me now going to a fundraiser at 12:30,' Giuliani responded.\n\nThe Ukrainian government ultimately never released the statement.\n\nThe release of the text messages came on the same day Volker that spoke for more than eight hours to House lawyers.\n\nAdam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, released the texts late Thursday night.\n\nUkrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, pictured at a press conference in Kiev on Tuesday, spoke to Donald Trump by phone on July 25\n\nTrump has pushed for an investigation of the unproven theory that Joe Biden, when he was vice president, pressured the Ukrainian government to fire the country's top prosecutor to protect his son Hunter and Burisma Holdings, which was accused of corrupt practices\n\nIn a joint letter with fellow committee chairmen Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel, Schiff and his colleagues accused the Trump administration of 'unethical and unpatriotic' behavior.", "description": "'Somebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one,' Trump tweeted on Saturday from DC.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith", "Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/21/19341926-0-image-a-58_1570306388448.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
