That is until I realized the large, extremely obvious UFO-like structure, located in Amsterdam\u2019s Kortjewantsbrug-area, a short walk from central station, was what I was looking for. Once a former bridge house, only a week before my arrival the tower had been introduced as the newest building in SWEETS collection of rooms scattered across the city, each with a unique story and view of the city\u2019s legion of waterways. Quirk, meet history.\n\nAmsterdam\u2019s reputation as the \u201cVenice of the North\u201d began in the 1600s, when the city started digging concentric canals as a way to transport goods across the area. Houses along those canals were installed as a way to open and close bridges, allowing larger loads to pass through. It was a system that worked fairly well, until like so many other careers, automation killed it.\n\nOriginally proposed as an urban renewal project, SWEETS goal was to use these vacated spaces as a way to spread tourism across the city, the obvious point being that if you\u2019re sleeping in a neighborhood, you\u2019re likely to spend money there. Of course, the added bonus is that if your bridge house is full of tourists, it\u2019s less likely to be full of squatters (a trend developed in response to rising housing prices in the 1960s, and popularized with multiple locations along Vondelstraats street).\n\nBuilt between 1673 to 2009, and refurbished beginning in 2017, SWEETS\u2019 bridge houses cover the spread of the city\u2019s history. No two lodgings are the same (owing to original construction) which means the hotel offers 28 unique lodging experiences, with revamped interiors by Space&Matter, a combination that recently earned them the 2019 Entree Award for best concept.\n\nGetting into my house was a very modern experience that involved holding my phone against a sensor. (Customer service promptly answered my borderline luddite questions about this process.) However, entering felt more like a stylish trip back in time. The deep red spiral staircase lit with oversize light bulbs, lead to a tiny kitchen and a bathroom with a pull-chain toilet. On the upper story was a circular bed and wall-spanning circular desk. I\u2019m told this style is called \u201cNew Objectivity.\u201d Although given its bright colors and carefully plotted-out symmetry, it played out like one sweater-set short of a Marvelous Mrs. Maisel episode. This was no mistake\u2014each building is designed to reference the era when it was first operational, with bonus amenities like a powerful air conditioner and an iPad control system.\n\nThe real selling point, regardless of which SWEETS property you stay in, is the view. In Kortjewantsbrug, my spate of windows looked out on a triangle of Amsterdam history composed by the maritime museum, science museum, and architecture center. Built in 1967 by Dic Slebos, I was housed in one of the city\u2019s four harbor offices, a place where employees could keep an eye on water traffic and perform various administrative tasks. But now the perch feels like a wonderful secret, a unique and totally private perspective of the city\u2019s iconic waterways. After a night spent cheering on the tourist boats that passed under my windows (you will hear the city around you, which is why the hotel also provides earplugs), I felt so strongly about my watery domain that it didn\u2019t even bother me when I was woken up at 5am by a Cinescope-proportioned sunrise. Yes, my room came with blinds, and yes, I was too lazy to close them.\n\nSWEETS is perfect for solo travelers and couples specifically looking for a destination hotel that honors the spirit of the city. (Children under the age of twenty-one aren\u2019t allowed.) Drop your expectations of what you think a hotel exterior should look like (it\u2019ll cut down the time it takes to actually find your room), celebrate that the lack of room service allows you to sample local bakeries, close your blinds, and you\u2019ll be going Dutch in no time.\n\nSWEETS Hotel Amsterdam \u2013 Starting at \u20ac130 a night\n\nEditor's Note: This is the latest in our series on exciting new hotels, The New Room with a View.", "description": "Squatters once enjoyed the unparalleled views that come with Amsterdam\u2019s bridge gatehouses, but now they\u2019ve been overhauled and are some of the city\u2019s most unique hotel rooms.", "authors": ["Laura Studarus"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568694604/190916-studarus-room-with-view-tease_lasx58", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
