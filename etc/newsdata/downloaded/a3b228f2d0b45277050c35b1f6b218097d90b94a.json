It\u2019s just implausible to imagine that she had her drink spiked, it just doesn\u2019t sort of add up. She\u2019s just a very plain Jane type of girl. I can\u2019t understand why anybody would be possessed by her.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also taken his fucked up comments onto Facebook, posting CCTV footage with the caption \u201cThe large girl with the white top, the short black skirt and the black and white shoes is Shantel Smith, the girl who claimed to have had her drink spiked.\u201d\n\nShantel spoke to Nine News after her Instagram post went viral, explaining that she woke up \u201cin a toilet stall. There was vomit everywhere and I was foaming at the mouth.\u201d\n\nShe also slammed Rapture again, saying \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe I was being blamed for something that happened to me without my knowledge.\u201d", "description": "Rapture nightclub owner Neil Scott has made more disparaging comments about alleged drink spiking at his premises, calling Shantel Smith a \"plain Jane\".", "authors": ["Melissa Mason"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-08-at-2.59.09-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
