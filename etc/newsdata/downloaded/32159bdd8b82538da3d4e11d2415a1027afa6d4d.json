A silly, single-track economy which threatens to drag us down.", "language": "en", "text": "The country isn\u2019t as crash hot as it likes to pretend. (Photo by Chris Hopkins, Getty Images)\n\nDepsite Australia\u2019s status as the eighth richest country in the world, the economy that got it there has been ranked 93rd, according to new analysis by Harvard University.\n\nComparable to poorer nations like Mali (122nd richest), Zimbabwe (108th richest) and Senegal (116th richest), Australia is heavily reliant on just a couple of sectors like mining, energy and metals.\n\nIn fact just three main products \u2013 iron, coal and gas \u2013 make up the majority of its net exports by value, despite being far better placed to embrace new industries.\n\nThe analysis shows that Australia adds little of value to its resources, exporting raw materials instead of using its workforce to create value and enrich itself.\n\nAll of those factors threaten a near 29 years of prosperity, with the country being urged to come up with some new economic ideas.\n\nIn more evidence of Australia\u2019s status as the \u2018lucky country\u2019 it\u2019s been shown that we\u2019ve managed to get rich with a terribly dumb economic strategy.\n\nDespite our relative wealth, new analysis from Harvard University\u2019s Growth Lab ranks our economy, in terms of complexity, as 93rd in the world, trailing the likes of Uzbekistan and Albania \u2014 hardly economic powerhouses.\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2069 is \u2068less complex than expected\u2069 for its income level. As a result, its economy is projected to grow \u2068slowly,\u201d the report said, forecasting it to be the 111th fastest growth country over the decade.\n\nAfter 28 years of consecutive growth \u2014 an unprecedented streak globally \u2014 Australia\u2019s ranking has actually been getting relatively simpler as each year goes by. Coming out of recession in 1991, the country ranked almost 40 places higher at number 57 on the same measure.\n\nBroadly speaking, the analysis shows that Australia is laboured with a dumb economy in which we export plenty of value, but we don\u2019t actually create or add any value ourselves.\n\nAustralia\u2019s net export profile (Source: Harvard Growth Lab)\n\nPut another way, rather than develop new technology, we sell the raw materials to others to do that. Rather than lead the world, we simply supply those who do. Unsurprisingly, the full national profile makes for sobering reading.\n\nIron, coal and gas alone account for a staggering 60% of the country\u2019s net exports, illustrating the nation\u2019s enormous reliance on just a few natural resources. While those natural reserves have helped Australia get rich, they\u2019ve also allowed complacency to set in as we\u2019ve ridden good luck, and not good management, to prosperity.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get a whole lot better as you dig deeper. Tourism, food, alcohol, wool and metals make up nearly the whole remainder. In fact, literally everything else that Australia sells amounts to a single digit of our economy.\n\nThat\u2019s put in on a similar footing to some of the world\u2019s poorest countries like Mali, Senegal and Zimbabwe. Unlike those nations however, Australia has had few excuses to not do better.\n\nIn puts Australia in a precarious position, where the nation\u2019s fortunes are boosted or buffeted by global demand for just a handful of resources. Consider that Australia just recorded its worst financial year in two decades, as the economy continues to stumble. In fact, it would have been the worst since the 1991 recession had it not been for a booming iron ore price that produced a miraculous trade surplus.\n\nREAD MORE: It\u2019s official: Australia\u2019s economy is slipping and just suffered its worst year since the GFC\n\nREAD MORE: Australia\u2019s economy is struggling but don\u2019t expect any Rudd-style cash handouts under this government\n\nThat\u2019s not a good long-term strategy.\n\n\u201cThe Growth Lab\u2019s \u20682027\u2069 Growth Projections foresee growth in \u2068Australia\u2069 of \u20682.2%\u2069 annually over the coming decade, ranking in the \u2068bottom half\u2069 of countries globally,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cEconomic growth is driven by diversification into new products that are incrementally more complex.\u201d\n\nInstead, Australia has added just seven new export products since 2002 \u2014 compared to 17 in New Zealand \u2014 with Harvard blaming this for the country\u2019s marked lack of income growth.\n\nSo what does Harvard recommend for such a laggard economy?\n\n\u201cWith few nearby opportunities, growth can be pursued by making longer jumps into strategic areas with future diversification potential,\u201d it said.\n\nIn other words, the country needs to reform and find opportunities to grow.\n\nIt brings to mind the famous warning that Singapore issued in 1980, when Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said Australia risked becoming the \u201cpoor white trash\u201d of Asia if we didn\u2019t open up our economy.\n\nWhile the Hawke-Keating reforms of the late 80s and early 90s did much to heed that call, Australia has repeatedly failed to embrace the opportunities presented to it since.\n\nFrom lithium batteries to renewable energy and the age of innovation heralded by former PM Malcolm Turnbull, there are plenty of balls that Australia has been happy to let go through to the keeper.\n\nHarvard\u2019s message, repackaged in the vernacular of the current Prime Minister, is that Australia badly needs to \u201chave a go\u201d if it wants to get one.\n\nREAD MORE: By 2060, Australia cities could be cheaper, entirely powered by renewables and you could earn $40k more \u2014 if we don\u2019t screw it up\n\nREAD MORE: Australia has a \u2018once in a generation opportunity\u2019 to become a major battery hub\n\nREAD MORE: Atlassian boss Mike Cannon-Brookes is funding the world\u2019s largest solar farm here to sell energy to Asia via a cable\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
