His efforts to dig up dirt on the president\u2019s political opponents have landed his highest-profile client in a congressional impeachment investigation. And two of his foreign-born business associates are headed to trial on charges that are part of a broader effort by federal prosecutors eyeing Giuliani himself.\n\nThe scrutiny isn\u2019t just coming from the previously known probes by FBI agents and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office based out of Manhattan, according to two people familiar with the investigation. The criminal division of the Justice Department in Washington has taken an interest in the former New York mayor, too, meaning an expansion of resources that indicates the politically sensitive probe into the president\u2019s personal attorney is both broader and moving at a faster pace than previously understood.\n\nAdding DOJ\u2019s criminal division to the Giuliani probe is sure to place additional scrutiny on William Barr, who as attorney general has final say over all department business. Already, Barr\u2019s reputation has taken hits over his handling of the public rollout on Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, with Democrats complaining he spun the special counsel\u2019s findings earlier this year to give them a pro-Trump flavor.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
