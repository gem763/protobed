But I'm sure I'm not going to kneel to ask for an extension. That's the British thing.\n\n\" From today's perspective, I cannot judge what Premier Johnson will do at the European Council this week. There is also a British law that forces Johnson to ask for extension . And what brings the British parliament to the final decision is not clear.\n\n\" I recently said that compared to the British parliament, an Egyptian Sphinx is an open book. So you have to wait, and because of England , drink tea.\"\n\nMr Juncker also said he regretted listening to David Cameron when the then prime minister insisted the EU should not intervene in the 2016 referendum campaign.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
