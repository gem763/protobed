Conservative chief whip in the Lords, Lord Ashton of Hyde, said in the early hours of Thursday the government intends that the bill \"will be ready\" for royal assent on Monday, after consideration by MPs.\n\nThis is despite Boris Johnson's protestations that such a law would take away his leverage in talks with Brussels over the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU.\n\nHaving lost that argument to opposition MPs and Tory rebels he expelled from the party, the prime minister also failed in a bid to force a general election for 15 October. While Mr Johnson says he needs public backing for his negotiating strategy, most opposition parties refused to support his election call.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the PM of playing a \"disingenuous game\" and other critics said Mr Johnson could use the election to block the passage of the bill that aims to stop no-deal.\n\nMr Corbyn's requirement for supporting an election? That the bill gained royal assent.\n\nStruggling to keep up with what happened on Wednesday? Here's a quick recap of five key moments\n\nWondering where we go from here?

It shows roofs torn off, cars, shipping containers and boats overturned, and debris scattered for miles, with water levels still high. Marsh Harbour in the Abaco Islands has been particularly badly hit. Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said at least 20 people had been killed. The storm has weakened but grown larger as it approaches the US eastern seaboard, where it is expected to bring a \"life-threatening storm surge\".\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\n'Treated like animals' by slavery gang\n\nAn example of modern-day slavery in the UK is laid bare by the BBC's Panorama, which reports how a ruthless gang lured about 300 victims from Poland with false promises of free travel, accommodation and jobs. The slaves were held captive in squalid conditions, some having to wash in canals and eat from skips, the investigation team report. Eight members of the gang, thought to have made \u00a32m from the racket, are now behind bars.\n\nThe 'OK' hand gesture that's rattled China's authorities\n\nBy Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring\n\nA video showing a Chinese girl using a clever technique to signal she needs help has been widely shared on popular social network TikTok. She is shown being escorted away by a stranger in an airport. Unable to make a cry for help, she makes a subtle hand gesture that looks like the signal for \"OK\".\n\nThis alerts a passer-by, who immediately begins to argue with the man, and helps others recognise that the girl is being held against her will. She is then reunited with her parents. So why has the video created such a big reaction on Chinese social media, and made the authorities so upset?\n\nRead the full article\n\nWhat the papers say\n\nThe front pages are less than complimentary about either the \"cornered\" prime minister or the leader of the opposition. \"Britain's worst PM,\" is how the Daily Mirror describes Boris Johnson, while the Metro sums up his Commons record with: \"He just can't win.\" Meanwhile, a column on the front of the Daily Telegraph describes Jeremy Corbyn as a \"puppet\", and the Labour leader \"chickens out\" of facing a general election in the Daily Mail's view. The Sun goes one further, overlaying Mr Corbyn's face onto a photo of a hen to ask: \"Is THIS the most dangerous chicken in Britain.\"\n\nDaily digest\n\nPlant-based diets Research suggests link to higher stroke risk\n\nIran tanker US offers captain millions to hand over ship\n\nBritish railways Reports of violent crime increase\n\nMotorway spillage HGV carrying 32,000 litres of gin crashes on M6\n\nIf you see one thing today\n\nFour failed inventions that changed the world\n\nIf you listen to one thing today\n\nForaging: Pleasure or profit?\n\nIf you read one thing today\n\nThe 'golden age' of video games magazines\n\nSign up for a morning briefing direct to your phone\n\nLookahead\n\nToday Pope Francis continues his tour of Mozambique, Madagascar and Mauritius in the former's capital Maputo.\n\n21:00 Protesters take to the streets of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil, to demand more protection for the Amazon rainforest\n\nOn this day\n\n1997 Mother Teresa, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who devoted her life to helping the sick and the poor, dies aged 87 of a heart attack at the headquarters of the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta.\n\nFrom elsewhere\n\nBritain's political chaos shows everything is okay (Atlantic)\n\nGabriela Peacock, nutritionist to the Royals: You don't need crazy diets (Telegraph)\n\nThis new smartphone satire is like 'Fleabag' for wannabe influencers (Mashable)\n\nThe Testaments by Margaret Atwood - read the exclusive first extract (Guardian)", "description": "Your morning briefing for 5 September 2019.", "authors": ["Andy Mcfarlane", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/106E6/production/_108620376_hi056254838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
