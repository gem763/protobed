They were wrong. Indeed, those folks missed a remarkable opportunity to acquire equities at phenomenal bargains.\n\nLeading into the 2016 election, plenty of people believed that Donald Trump\u2019s unpredictable nature and tempestuous style would result in a stock market disaster. They were wrong too. Wall Street quickly warmed up to the prospect for dramatic reductions in corporate taxes, sending stocks skyward.\n\nFor more than three decades, I have counseled investors to put aside their political feelings. Those emotions rarely prove beneficial. Instead, folks ought to focus on fundamental valuation, the business cycle (a.k.a. \u201ccredit cycle\u201d) and technical trends.\n\nAs we barrel toward the 2020 election, however, I must acknowledge the uniqueness of the risks. Would a Democrat sweep in Congress result in the rolling back of tax reform? The possibility of higher corporate tax rates would further aggravate the \u201cE\u201d in P/E at a time when most metrics already point to dramatic overvaluation and an earnings slowdown.\n\nValuation Indicators\n\nIn a similar vein, the trade war has adversely impacted the profits at scores of U.S. corporations with sizable overseas operations. Could Trump\u2019s reelection contribute to global economic contraction? At a moment when the global economy is clearly on the ropes, there may be a tipping point whereby a recession in 2020 or 2021 becomes an inevitability.\n\nGlobal Manufacturing\n\nAnother undeniable brick in the wall of worry? Both parties seem oblivious to the dangers of quantitative easing (QE) and ultra-low interest rate policies. Yet both Dems and Repubs would welcome short-term adrenaline boosts by the Federal Reserve. Regardless of the way it creates malinvestment and bubbles. Regardless of the way it destroys saving and fosters excessive borrowing.\n\nKeep in mind, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has exclaimed that the U.S. will definitely resort to negative interest rates in the future. Just like Europe. Since negative interest rate policy became the norm at the European Central Bank (ECB), the damage to European financial firms is undeniable.\n\niShares MSCI Europe Financials, Financial Select Sector SPDR (gold)\n\nWould the U.S. stock market really be okay if the European banking segment failed to survive? Is our exposure genuinely negligible?\n\nGranted, commentators love to say that stocks climb the proverbial \u201cWall of Worry.\u201d Then again, a time always comes when there are a few too many bricks.\n\nConsider these additional warning signs:\n\n1. Junk Bonds. The risk in the high-yield bond market may have reached its highest level since crashing hit energy-company debt in 2016. In particular, the U.S. distress ratio, which is the proportion of junk bonds that yield more than 10% above comparable Treasury bonds, leaped to 9.4% in August.\n\n2. Earnings Growth (or lack thereof). According to FactSet, the estimated earnings decline for the for Q3 2019 is -3.6%. Granted, the negative bar may make it possible for companies to easily beat expectations. On the other hand, if we see an actual year-over-year decline for Q3, that would be three quarters of negative earnings growth in a row for the heralded index.\n\nS&P 500 Q3 Earnings Decline\n\n3. Consumer Confidence. The brightest spot in all of the U.S. economy has been the willingness of the consumer to spend. People are working. And people are spending. Yet consumer confidence indicators have been diverging, with the \u2019s reading sitting near highs and the \u2019s sentiment moving sharply lower.\n\nUS Consumer Confidence\n\n4. Corporate Spending. Nobody knows more about the capital spending intentions of corporations than Chief Financial Officers. So when 67% of U.S. CFOs anticipate that the U.S. will be \u201cin recession\u201d by Q3 2020, and 84% by Q1 2021, the data are probably telling.\n\n5. Recession Indications. Speaking of the probability that a recession will occur within the next 12 months, perhaps in Q3 2020, the New York Fed\u2019s model reached 37.3%. Think that\u2019s low? Think again. While recessions have occurred without ever getting as high as 35% on the Fed model, or 37.3%, they\u2019ve ALWAYS occurred in conjunction with the model hitting these percentage levels or shortly thereafter. (See the orange line below.)\n\nCorporate Recession Outlook\n\nAdditionally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) provides a composite leading indicator for identifying turning points in business cycles. The U.S. is currently at its lowest point since 2009. What\u2019s more, the last time that the indicator breached 99 on the downside, the 2008 Great Recession was underway.\n\nOECD Indicator For Identifying Business Cycle Turning Points\n\nNaturally, a host of articles have been written about . For that matter, many export-dependent countries are already in recession. I won\u2019t repeat the discussion here.\n\nNevertheless, there is uncertainty about everything from Federal Reserve policy to global trade skirmishes with China, from corporate earnings to European economic malaise, from consumer retrenchment to potentially damaging ramifications in the political theater. It may be naive to ignore the Wall of Worry entirely.\n\nExpect a downward pressure on interest rates to resume, regardless if the Fed is foolish enough to utter the words, \u201cmid-cycle adjustment.\u201d Real estate investment trusts (REITS) continue to benefit. Preferred stock shares do as well.\n\nIn fact, you may want to look at \u201cREIT Preferreds\u201d if you are wary of the riskier REIT holding.
