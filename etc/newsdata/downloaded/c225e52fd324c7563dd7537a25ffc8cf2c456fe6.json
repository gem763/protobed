He concluded:\n\n\u201cRippleNet is more than just a suite of software.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported yesterday, alluding to the spate of controversies that have beset the project, Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, argued that Ripple\u2019s \u201ctransparency has opened us up to attack.\u201d He said that there is a \u201cbunch of misinformation\u201d out there, but claimed that this is in part because Ripple is \u201cten or a hundred times more transparent than anyone in the crypto community.\u201d", "description": "The xRapid, xVia and xCurrent services offered by blockchain firm Ripple have been fused into features of its RippleNet network", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNWMyODA1NmE5YmIyMDU1ODczMjRjZTMxNjBhMTM2MmMuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
