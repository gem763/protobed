Mr. Gray is carving his own space out of space, so to speak, and provides startling new ways of seeing the knowable universe. But there\u2019s also a \u201c2001\u201d-ish dread to \u201cAd Astra,\u201d a creep-show quality that arises not just from the eeriness of events, but from having the human being\u2019s place in the cosmos rendered so insignificant, and solitary.\n\nFew movie heroes are as solitary as Roy McBride ( Brad Pitt ), an overachieving astronaut whose father, Clifford ( Tommy Lee Jones ), was\u2014and perhaps is\u2014the most famous American space explorer, a combination Chuck Yeager, Neil Armstrong and Flash Gordon. Nearly three decades earlier (the film is set in \u201cthe near future\u201d), he disappeared on a mission to contact extraterrestrial life, which is presumed to exist, judging by the opening titles\u2014which also suggest that such a belief is rooted in desperation about the state of life on Earth, and a hope that solutions might be found elsewhere.\n\nThere is a hallucinogenic opening sequence during which all this is sketchily and portentously explained, but the first real action takes place on the International Space Antenna, which sends signals skyward and is stationed near the ceiling of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. When the massive antenna is struck by an electrical storm coming from an unknown source in space, Roy\u2014whose heart rate, someone notes, has never risen above 80 BPM\u2014plummets to earth with preternatural cool, keeping his head even as shrapnel from above is punching holes in his parachute.\n\nBrad Pitt as Roy McBride Photo: Twentieth Century Fox\n\nStill, Roy is unnerved by what his superiors ask him to do next: record a message that will be beamed toward Neptune, Clifford\u2019s presumed destination and the source of the destructive impulses. Is Clifford alive? Does he need help? What can be done? That the elder McBride is somehow responsible for the attacks is the unspoken message, but much is unspoken in \u201cAd Astra\u201d (the screenplay is by Mr. Gray and Ethan Gross ): Why doesn\u2019t Space Com quite trust Roy? And why doesn\u2019t Roy trust Space Com? Perhaps because Roy thinks the government was responsible for his fatherless childhood. And that if Clifford is alive it wants to kill him again.\n\n\u201cAd Astra\u201d will remind viewers of other recent and very ruminative space movies, including \u201cGravity,\u201d \u201cMoon\u201d and \u201cFirst Man.\u201d But where those films looked out, \u201cAd Astra\u201d looks in\u2014and the way it does so is the signature of the film and the heart of Mr. Pitt\u2019s performance. After each crisis or mission or irregular incident, Roy is subjected to a \u201cpsych eval,\u201d an interrogation by computer during which he has to explain his feelings in a manner that convinces the program he\u2019s being honest with it. And with himself. Has he found a way to game the software? No one will think so: The responses are too naked and deep, the effort too painful. Roy\u2019s ego has been scoured in a way that suggests psychoanalysis as a journey into deepest space.\n\nA scene from \u2018Ad Astra\u2019 Photo: Twentieth Century Fox\n\nTo lavish too much praise on Mr. Pitt\u2019s performance would be to somehow suggest he isn\u2019t already among the best actors on screen. He is. Between this film and the current \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood,\u201d he could and should be a double Oscar nominee next year. If he\u2019s not, it doesn\u2019t mean his performance in \u201cAd Astra\u201d isn\u2019t an epic one.\n\nAnd what of the traveler to Neptune? In his last known transmission, Clifford talked of seeing the face of the Almighty and of an inevitable reunion \u201cin exultation\u201d with his alien brothers and sisters. He\u2019s mad, and his idea of God as a destination is just one of the symptoms. But the real issue is ego, which has driven the man to virtually widow his wife and orphan a son who has been left unmoored and unable to connect with anything but a computer. ( Liv Tyler materializes throughout the film as Roy\u2019s estranged wife.) All of which may strike some viewers as biblical, Shakespearean and/or Greek. It\u2019s certainly unforgettable.\n\n\u2014Mr. Anderson is a Journal TV critic.
