Bridenstine was talking to reporters about the first all-female spacewalk which, after months of delay, took place last week.\n\n\u201cWe could very well see the first person on Mars be a woman. I think that could very well be a milestone,\u201d Bridenstine said, according to Space.com.\n\nThe NASA chief added that whoever does end up traveling to Mars is probably too young to be in NASA\u2019s current astronaut corps. Bridenstine said over the summer that a trip to Mars won\u2019t happen until some time in the 2030s.\n\n\u201cIf my 11-year-old daughter has her way, we\u2019ll have a woman on Mars in the not-too-distant future,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the same press conference, President Donald Trump applauded astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir after they completed the first ever all-female spacewalk.\n\n\u201cWhat you do is incredible ... You\u2019re very brave people. I don\u2019t think I want to do it, I must tell you that. But you are amazing people.\u201d Trump said, NPR reported. \u201cThis is truly historic.\u201d\n\nMeir thanked the president during the press conference, adding that she and Koch don\u2019t want to take too much credit because other women have done space walks in the past.\n\n\u201cFor us, this is really just us doing our jobs,\u201d she said.", "description": "\u201cIf my 11-year-old daughter has her way, we\u2019ll have a woman on Mars in the not-too-distant future,\u201d NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daf0e6f200000881c5066d8.jpeg?cache=0hrsefnrbp&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
