We must have a Final Say", "language": "en", "text": "Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal to hold an election on 12 December seems set to be defeated in the Commons this afternoon. But Jo Swinson\u2019s and Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s plan to hold one on 9 December may have legs \u2013 particularly if the prime minister jumps on board and supports it.\n\nThis would be unfortunate. It would be better to push for a People\u2019s Vote before an election.\n\nThe Lib Dem and SNP leaders say their election plan is the best way to stop a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit. But they are overstating their case.\n\nThere are at least three ways that we could still crash out of the EU \u2013 even now that the bloc has delayed Brexit until 31 January.\n\nFirst, if Johnson loses the election, he doesn\u2019t have to resign immediately unless another party gets a majority \u2013 and the chance of that happening is slim. (See the Cabinet Manual, 2.11). So he could wait until parliament meets again, at which point he still only has to resign if there is a \u201cclear alternative\u201d. (Cabinet Manual, 2.12).\n\nIt\u2019s also up to the prime minister to advise the Queen when to bring back parliament after an election. (Cabinet Manual, 2.4). Normally, it\u2019s on a Wednesday. So, with Christmas coming, the prime minister could delay the first meeting of parliament until 8 January. And if he wanted to postpone it even longer, there\u2019s no obvious legal route to stop him. There could then be endless wrangling about who should take over and, before you knew it, 31 January would be upon us and we could crash out.\n\nSecond, if Johnson hangs on as prime minister after an election without a solid majority, he could put a gun to MPs\u2019 heads \u2013 saying they either have to support his rotten deal unchanged, or there\u2019ll be no deal. If neither side backed down in this game of chicken, we\u2019d crash out on 31 January.\n\nFinally, the no-deal option won\u2019t be off the table even if Johnson wins the election and gets MPs to back his deal. The prime minister\u2019s withdrawal agreement only postpones our departure from the EU\u2019s single market until the end of next year. Johnson says he won\u2019t extend this \u201ctransition\u201d.\n\nSo, if he doesn\u2019t manage to agree a trade deal with the bloc by the end of next year, which would be extraordinarily fast, we\u2019ll be staring at another cliff edge. Again, crashing out is a real risk \u2013 especially after Kwasi Kwarteng, the business minister, revealed that \u201cno deal\u201d would not be taken off the table.\n\nThe Lib Dem/SNP legislation could be altered to fix the first of these problems. It could determine not just the date of the election, but also state that parliament should be recalled before Christmas. But it can\u2019t deal with the other two.\n\nIf there was no viable alternative, it might still be sensible to go with the Swinson/Sturgeon plan. But there is one: ask the people in a final say referendum whether they want Johnson\u2019s deal or would prefer to stay in the EU. That\u2019s a far better way of deciding what happens on Brexit than muddling it up with who runs the country.\n\nPessimists will say there isn\u2019t a majority in this parliament for a People\u2019s Vote. But the more MPs scrutinise the prime minister\u2019s pig of a deal, the more they will see its flaws. Tory MPs who were kicked out of the party increasingly realise the danger of a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit in 2020. Labour MPs who were tempted by Johnson\u2019s commitment to uphold workers\u2019 rights should see he is double-crossing them after a government document boasting how it could wriggle out of its promises was leaked to the FT.\n\nSuch MPs may well now conclude that a Final Say referendum is the best way to resolve the crisis. It would be a mistake to go for an election before having one last push to get a People\u2019s Vote through this parliament.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal to hold an election on 12 December seems set to be defeated in the Commons this afternoon.
