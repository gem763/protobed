If the results hold, the two men will face off in December and Morales could be vulnerable to a united opposition in the first runoff in his nearly 14 years in power.\n\nTo avoid a runoff and win outright, Morales would have needed to get 50% of the votes plus one or have 40% and finish 10 percentage points ahead of the nearest challenger. If a second round is required, it will take place on 15 December.\n\n\u2018Democracy in Bolivia has two faces\u2019: ambivalence as Evo Morales seeks fourth term Read more\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to wait until the last vote is counted,\u201d Morales told his supporters in La Paz\u2019s Plaza Murillo on Sunday night. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win again.\u201d\n\nCarlos Mesa also announced a victory for democracy, telling supporters shortly after the first results were announced that his coalition had scored \u201can unquestionable triumph,\u201d and he urged others parties to join him for a \u201cdefinitive triumph\u201d in the second round.\n\nNational coordinator of Mesa\u2019s coalition, Jose Antonio Quiroga, did not rule out fraud. On election day, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re really worried. It\u2019s looking like the MAS won\u2019t allow the process to go to a second round.\u201d\n\nIt is almost certain that Morales will lose the two thirds majority in Bolivia\u2019s Congress that he has held since 2009. This will make fulfilling a legislative agenda far more difficult even if he does win the runoff.\n\n\u201cWhat is different from the elections in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, is that there is a movement towards the centre by all the candidates,\u201d says political scientist Fernando Mayorga. \u201cWhy? Because they all fundamentally agree with the principal economic and social accomplishments of the MAS government.\u201d\n\nThese include tripling per-capita income and unprecedented government investments in schools, hospitals and roads. These outlays have built Morales a formidable base among working class people. At a MAS campaign rally, sixty-two-year-old Rosa Rojas Canaviri said, \u201cAs a child I didn\u2019t have any of the opportunities that poor children now have thanks to Evo.\u201d\n\nMorales came to prominence leading social protests in the landlocked country of 11 million people and rose to power as Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president in 2006. The 59-year-old leftist is South America\u2019s longest-serving leader.\n\nMesa is a 66-year-old historian who as vice president rose to Bolivia\u2019s top office when his predecessor resigned the presidency in 2003 amid widespread protests. Mesa then stepped aside himself in 2005 amid renewed demonstrations led by Morales, who was then leader of the coca growers union.\n\nAfter a decade of economic boom, the country faces an increasing budget deficit and declining international reserves. Morales also has faced growing dissatisfaction even among his indigenous supporters. Some are frustrated by corruption scandals linked to his administration \u2013 though not Morales himself \u2013 and many by his refusal to accept a referendum on limiting presidential terms.\n\nLate on Sunday night, the Organisation of American States\u2019 Electoral Tribunal expressed concerns about the vote counting process.\n\nThe outcome of a second round will likely depend on alliances between second and third place candidates. \u201cFourth place candidate Oscar Ortiz expressed vehement rejection of Carlos Mesa\u2019s proposals during the campaign,\u201d said Kath Ledebur of the Cochabamba-based think tank, Andean Information Network. \u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t be the first time in Bolivia\u2019s electoral history that sworn enemies have formed marriages of convenience to take office.\u201d", "description": "President is ahead in early counting but could be vulnerable to a united opposition in a runoff", "authors": ["Linda Farthing In La Paz"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c194b0e9da35b31807d6a816133088d20bff20e/0_333_4716_2828/master/4716.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4e0d3e2317427a4edde38a1b42ae2477", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
