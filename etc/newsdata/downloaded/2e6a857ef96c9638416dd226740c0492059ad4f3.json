It is important to listen and process feedback from those around you, but leaders have to stand and deliver. And the ability to hold an audience\u2019s attention and communicate ideas effectively is a mark of leadership, presentation coach Richard Mulholland told a recent GIBS Forum.\n\n\u201cThe difference between a leader and a manager is the ability to communicate.\u201d\n\nMulholland began his career as a rock \u2019n roll roadie for bands like Iron Maiden and Def Leppard, and then started Missing Link, a global presentation firm operating out of Johannesburg. Mulholland provides presentation coaching to CEOs and TED speakers. He is the author of the bestselling Legacide and the recent Boredom Slayer, about how to grab and keep an audience\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cThe objective of any presentation is to deliver information in order to achieve a result. When presenting content, the opposite of boring is memorable,\u201d he explained.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentation myths\n\nMulholland picked apart some of the commonly accepted myths around presenting and public speaking:\n\n1. The belief that presenters must avoid \u2018death by PowerPoint\u2019 at all costs is not helpful, he said: \u201c You can\u2019t blame PowerPoint for a bad presentation; that\u2019s like blaming a pan for a bad meal. Don\u2019t ban it, just make it better.\u201d PowerPoint is a linear tool that can help you stay on track, as people have dual channel processing and process messages using both visual and audio cues. PowerPoint can act as a visual anchor to make a presentation more memorable.\n\nWhile a slide\u2019s title acts a chapter heading, images shouldn\u2019t simply replicate the title, but rather hold the audience\u2019s attention by creating an element of curiosity, even if it doesn\u2019t make sense initially.\n\n\n\n2. The myth of \u201cknow your audience\u2019 is sometimes simply impossible. However, every audience has an authenticity detector and presenters should always allow themselves to be authentic: \u201cThe people in the market for boring are spoilt for choice. The easiest way to stand out from the crowd is to be yourself.\u201d\n\n3. Presenting is not all about the delivery and being a great speaker, but rather about writing a good talk before you deliver it: \u201cIt comes down to the structure and the narrative. Most speaking training focuses on delivery, but a compelling narrative structure draws people in.\u201d\n\nMulholland argued that a good presenter doesn\u2019t have to be energetic or exciting, but that the message must be fundamentally compelling and interesting.\n\n\u201cWrite the right story and it will draw people in. You don\u2019t have to be big and energetic, but you must be compelling. The most wasted commodity today is people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nUsing notes when presenting isn\u2019t problematic, Mulholland said, but presenters should be aware that they \u201ccan be like training wheels on a bicycle.\u201d He rather suggested including more slides, which would allow for free flow within the presentation. It is especially important to memorise the segues, or transitions between slides.\n\n\u201cAlways work under the assumption that your tech will fail. Remember, you are the presentation,\u201d he added.\n\nWith microphone technology, voice modulation has become more important than voice projection, he explained. \u201cDon\u2019t keep your voice at the same volume and pitch all the time, then your peaks will mean nothing.\u201d\n\nA formula for delivering effective presentations\n\nMulholland shared four tips for giving effective presentations:\n\n1. Give them a reason to care\n\nDon\u2019t bury the lead: \u201cGive people a reason to care up front, you have to buy their attention.\u201d\n\n2. Give them a reason to believe\n\n3. Tell them what they need to know\n\nRather than focusing on a USP, or unique selling proposition, Mulholland suggested devising a UPS, or Unique Problem that only you can Solve.\n\n\u201cMake your audience care about the solution so that they listen to you. Work out what the unique problem is and make customers believe that problem is important.\u201d\n\n4. Tell them what they need to do\n\nGive implicit instructions: \u201cDon\u2019t ask people initially for the ultimate goal, you want them to take the first step. The chain of events will then follow. Or, don\u2019t try to convince people to become vegan, rather first offer them the choice between a paper or plastic straw.\u201d\n\nKey leadership lessons\n\n\u201cNothing feeds the status quo like the unspoken thoughts of leaders,\u201d Mulholland said.\n\nHis advice to those who are nervous of speaking and presenting is to develop rituals.\n\n\u201cIgnore the people who tell you it is scary. It is scary because it matters, and because it matters, you must do it.\n\n\u201cNo great act of consequence came from a silent leader. To lead is to speak. So lead loud.\u201d", "description": "Nobody listens their way to the top. It is important to listen and process feedback from those around you, but leaders have to stand and deliver.
