REUTERS/Shamil Zhumatov/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Kazakhstan\u2019s Kaspi.kz KSPI.KZ, which controls the Central Asian nation\u2019s third-largest lender Kaspi Bank, said on Monday it was postponing a London listing due to market conditions.\n\nThe financial group, a leader in the Kazakh payment systems and e-commerce sector, had said in September it planned to sell existing shares in the form of global depository receipts (GDRs).\n\nBut the group said on Monday it was postponing the listing because of \u201cunfavorable and uncertain market conditions, particularly in the technology sector\u201d.\n\nThe move comes after serviced-office operator WeWork, backed by technology investor Softbank, pulled its initial public offering (IPO) last month following a highly public takedown of the firm\u2019s mooted valuation and governance.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased with the very strong interest shown by investors and their very high level of engagement in the process. However, we\u2019ve come to the decision that the timing is not the best at the current moment for an IPO,\u201d said Mikheil Lomtadze, chairman of Kaspi.kz\u2019s management board.\n\nShareholders who had planned to sell down stakes in Kaspi.kz\u2019s listing included Baring Vostok funds, Goldman Sachs, Kaspi.kz Chairman Vyacheslav Kim and Lomtadze.\n\nMorgan Stanley, UBS, Citigroup and Credit Suisse were acting as joint global coordinators on the offering, along with Renaissance Capital as joint bookrunner.", "description": "Kazakhstan's Kaspi.kz , which controls the Central Asian nation's third-largest lender Kaspi Bank, said on Monday it was postponing a London listing due to market conditions.", "authors": ["Simon Jessop", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437976385&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960B0", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
