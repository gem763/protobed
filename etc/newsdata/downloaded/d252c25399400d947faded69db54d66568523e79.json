It's a small town called Dildo \u2014 D-I-L-D-O. It's a real place in Newfoundland, Canada,\" Kimmel told his studio audience on his show Wednesday night.\n\nWith what is likely one of the most commonly stolen town signs in the province, if not Canada, Dildo is historically a fishing village, with a now-booming tourism industry, but the origins of the town's name, dating back to the 1700s, are not known for certain.\n\nWhat is known is, come from aways (people not from Newfoundland and Labrador) find the town's name hilarious, and Jimmy Kimmel Live is having a time with it.\n\nFor his California-based show Wednesday night, Kimmel dialed in a crew of \"Dildodians\" \u2014 people who live in Dildo \u2014 to talk about their town origins, as well as to announce he wanted to be the town's new mayor.\n\nThis gorgeous sunset was taken by Marion Noseworthy from the Dildo Boathouse. (Marion Noseworthy )\n\nCoun. Andrew Pretty said Kimmel's chances are \"slim to none\" because he'd have to come and get screeched in first.\n\nKimmel was perplexed, to say the least, saying, \"I didn't understand any of that.\n\n\"I'm gonna need to learn to speak Dildo before that.\"\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live's Guillermo Rodriguez puts up the sister cities sign. (Jimmy Kimmel Live/YouTube)\n\nDuring the show, Kimmel's crew erected a sign declaring Hollywood and Dildo \"sister cities.\"\n\nPretty said the town is totally on board, even though Dildo already has a sister city.\n\nCBC News headed to the small town on Thursday to get a sense of the newfound fame.\n\nDildo Coun. Andrew Pretty holds the town's newest sign, pointing to Hollywood and proclaiming it a sister city. (Katie Breen/CBC)\n\nPretty took the reporter to a local print shop and gave a glimpse of the town's newest sign \u2014 proclaiming Hollywood as a new sister city.\n\nAs for the town's name, Pretty said it was first recorded in 1711 on Dildo Island, but nobody knows why.\n\nHe came to realize it was a strange name in grade school, when he was tasked with doing a project on his hometown.\n\n\"The teacher warned us to be very careful with what we were searching on the internet.\"\n\nNow the top hit is Jimmy Kimmel Live.\n\nKarine McDonald is the owner of a small business in Dildo. She got a shoutout on Jimmy Kimmel Live. (Katie Breen/CBC)\n\n\"I just find it so funny. It went so far, so fast,\" said Karine McDonald, owner of Dildo Cove Coffee and Krafts.\n\nShe was one of the citizens in the video speaking with Kimmel on Wednesday night. Just a few days earlier, she had no idea her town was going to be on TV.\n\n\"When I saw it, I didn't know like, who is Jimmy Kimmel? I had to go and Google and make some search because I don't watch TV.\"\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel Live erected a sign declaring Hollywood and Dildo, N.L., sister cities, but if the talk show host wants to be mayor, he needs to get screeched in.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5239962.1565272287!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kimmel.jpg"}
