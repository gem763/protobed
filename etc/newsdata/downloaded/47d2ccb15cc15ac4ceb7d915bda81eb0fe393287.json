Unfortunately for Cane, the testing room was on the other side of the stadium. By the time he reached the room and was tested, the 10-minute limit for returning to the game had long passed. He was cleared, but had to sit out the second half of New Zealand\u2019s 23-13 win.\n\nNew Zealand raised the issue with match officials, and World Rugby changed the rule for this tournament and certain stadiums, only.\n\n\u201cWith immediate effect, the official 10-minute HIA window will commence from the moment the temporarily replaced player enters the HIA room, rather than when the player leaves the playing area,\u201d World Rugby said in a statement. \u201cThis is to facilitate slightly longer distances to the HIA room from the field of play at some of the venues.\u201d\n\nHansen was satisfied that \u201ccommon sense\u201d prevailed.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t overly happy about it last night when one of (our) best players is missing 40 minutes of the game. But it is what it is,\u201d Hansen said Sunday. He said World Rugby had \u201cshown good leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve acknowledged that they haven\u2019t got that part of it right and they\u2019ve changed it,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the Ireland-Scotland match on Sunday, Yokohama Stadium was hosting two more pool games, both semifinals, and the final.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "New Zealand coach Steve Hansen has welcomed a tweak to the head injury assessment rules after flanker Sam Cane missed the second half against South Africa in the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
