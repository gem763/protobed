I am no longer able to be myself day-in, day-out on the training field and consequently the playing field.\u201d\n\nToronto reportedly line up huge deal to lure Sonny Bill Williams back to rugby league Read more\n\n\u201cI have loved absolutely every minute: the highs, the lows, the grand final, coming home, my injuries, my dates with the judiciary. It really has been a fantastic ride.\u201d\n\nThe Rabbitohs captain had long battled shoulder issues but the discovery of an irreparable condition followed surgery earlier this season and it became progressively worse.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the drawcards for me in coming to coach at South Sydney,\u201d his club and international mentor Wayne Bennett said. \u201cI was lucky enough to coach Sam in the All Stars game in 2010. I\u2019d had heard so much about this Englishman that I had to see him for myself.\n\n\u201cThen I had the opportunity to coach him with England and I was hoping to coach him again this year with Great Britain. I\u2019m glad to have played a small role in his career and I feel blessed that he has been part of mine. I know he has made the right decision.\u201d\n\nThe loss of such a key player will be a major blow to the Rabbitohs, who also lost Greg Inglis prematurely this year. His imminent exit with three years to run on a multi-million dollar deal presents questions about the effect on South Sydney\u2019s salary cap, given his retirement is based on medical grounds.\n\nThe Rabbitohs are yet to formally request cap dispensation but it\u2019s believed they soon will given it is a new injury stopping Burgess playing again. The fact he is retiring before the beginning of the next rugby league year on November 1 could mean his entire wages are stricken from the 2020 cap if their application is successful.\n\nBurgess will go down as one of the NRL\u2019s great forwards. He has played 182 games for the club since arriving in 2010, and was the Clive Churchill medallist in their drought-breaking 2014 grand final success \u2013 after playing the majority of the game with a fractured cheekbone sustained in the opening moments.\n\nTough and rugged in the middle, he has been the leader of the Rabbitohs\u2019 forward pack since his NRL debut in 2010. He also played 88 games for Bradford in the English Super League, and represented England at the 2015 Rugby World Cup during a brief switch to the 15-man code.\n\nKangaroos coach Mal Meninga said Burgess was up there with some of the best Englishmen to have played in the NRL. \u201cIn my time he is certainly No 1 or No 2,\u201d Meninga said. \u201cI think Ellery Hanley was probably in that space as well. But in my time, he has done a fantastic job for England and paved the way for more Englishman to come out. He\u2019s been a great pioneer for them.\u201d\n\nMeninga\u2019s comments come after NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg on Tuesday described the 30-year-old Burgess as an ornament of the game, as speculation over the Souths star\u2019s future mounted. \u201cHe\u2019s the sort of player people want to watch,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cHe\u2019s the sort of player I like to watch... He\u2019s been a great competitor in our game, he\u2019s one of the best.\u201d\n\nHis retirement will come just months after Inglis had to call time on his career, and leaves brother Tom as the only remaining Burgess at Souths with George returning to Super League.", "description": "The South Sydney and England forward is has called time on his rugby league career as a result of an ongoing shoulder injury", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbd47ae9e957c508cbd319c6b1a9bac1ca04c8bd/0_394_6048_3630/master/6048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cb9a9203cf71a10293625988261cca0f", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
