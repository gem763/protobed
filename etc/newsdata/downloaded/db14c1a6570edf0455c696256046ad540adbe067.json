Days later it did. But, she warns: \u2018The fight is not over\u2019\n\nElla Mann is just 19 but she has already made her mark on the world. In September, feeling increasingly frightened by the quickening pace of climate change, she started writing a letter to one of Britain\u2019s leading theatre companies.\n\nIt was not a decision Mann took lightly, or one that she rushed. She spent days writing the letter which would pile pressure on the Royal Shakespeare Company to drop its longstanding relationship with oil giant BP.\n\n\u201cI thought it was ridiculous, because Shakespeare is a key part of our identity and this identity is being stained by its association with companies that are destroying our planet,\u201d said Mann, the daughter of a psychologist whose love of the natural world began from a young age.\n\nHer decision to take a stand worked: just days after her letter was published, the RSC announced its \u201cdifficult\u201d decision to end its sponsorship deal with BP at the end of this year, saying it was clear that the arrangement was \u201cputting a barrier\u201d between young people and the theatre.\n\nMann, a self-effacing gap-year student from Oxford who will study ecology and conservation biology at Leeds University next year, is one of a new generation of young activists and campaigners responding to the climate crisis in whatever way they can. She organised Oxford\u2019s first two school strikes as the university city sought to follow in the footsteps of Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who has become a global hero for the environmentally conscious.\n\nOver the past eight years our sponsorship has enabled 80,000 young people to see RSC performances at reduced rates BP\n\nBut Mann also felt compelled to tackle the relationships between fossil fuel companies and arts organisations that, she believes, are deeply hypocritical and have \u2013 until recently \u2013 been largely ignored.\n\nBeginning with the polite \u201cDear Royal Shakespeare Company\u201d, her letter, which was signed by schoolchildren and youngsters from across the country, made a passionate plea to the theatre company to abandon its association with BP.\n\n\u201cWe are the audiences of the future and we will not support theatre that accepts sponsorship from a company that is continuing to extract fossil fuels while our earth burns,\u201d wrote Mann, who is spending her gap year working on the social media strategy of environmental organisations.\u201cWe wish that the RSC would act on the ideas that they present in Matilda [a recent production at the theatre] and not give in to the powerful oppressor. As said by Matilda herself: \u2018If it\u2019s not right, you\u2019ve got to put it right!\u2019\u201d\n\nEnding with the ultimatum of a boycott she signed it off simply with \u201cKind regards, The youth.\u201d\n\nBP had been subsidising the theatre company\u2019s \u00a35 ticket scheme for 16- to 25-year-olds. In a statement, the company said it was \u201cdisappointed and dismayed\u201d its partnership had been brought to a \u201cpremature\u201d end. \u201cOver the past eight years our sponsorship has enabled 80,000 young people to see RSC performances at reduced rates,\u201d it continued.\n\nThe company said it shared \u201cmany of the concerns that apparently contributed to the decision\u201d and was committed to making energy \u201ccleaner and better\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe increasing polarisation of debate, and attempts to exclude companies committed to making real progress, is exactly what is not needed,\u201d it continued.\n\nIn June the Guardian revealed that Mark Rylance, who had been an associate artist with the RSC for 30 years, was resigning from his position, arguing that BP\u2019s sponsorship deal allowed the company to \u201cobscure the destructive reality of its activities\u201d, which he said threatened the future of the planet.\n\nMann said she had been overwhelmed by the support and welcomed the RSC\u2019s decision, but added there was a long road ahead.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing and people responded a lot quicker than I expected. This has been a massive win and I am really impressed with the RSC for taking a stand, but the fight is not over and we will continue to try and push BP out of other organisations,\u201d she added.\n\nOn Friday the National Theatre announced that it would end Shell\u2019s corporate membership at the end of next year, as the arts organisation accelerated plans to make itself carbon neutral in the face of a climate emergency. The move will increase pressure on other cultural institutions, such as the Royal Opera House, British Museum and National Portrait Gallery, all of which have come under pressure over tie-ins with fossil fuel firms.\n\nMann said: \u201cPeople needed to know about BP\u2019s sponsorships of arts institutions \u2013 they [BP] pretend that they are doing something positive \u2013 but the reality of their impact on the world is devastating.\u201d", "description": "Ella Mann pleaded with the Royal Shakespeare Company to end its BP sponsorship deal.
