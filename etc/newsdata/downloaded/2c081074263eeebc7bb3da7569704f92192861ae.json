After a brief flirtation with banana yellow, the couple opted for glossy electric blue cabinetry in the kitchen. More recently, they turned a former baseball conditioning room into a nightclub with a DJ booth for their children. Daughter Cymber Larkin, now a recording artist, once threw a Grammy Awards-themed party for friends there, they said.\n\nThe furnishings are bold and bright. A movie theater off the kitchen has purple carpeting and red, blue and purple columns.\n\nThe seven-bedroom home also has a game room, a gym, a professional recording studio and a two-story glass window overlooking an outdoor pool. Outside, there is a sports court that is used for tennis or basketball and a covered boat dock.\n\nBarry Larkin.

They spent several years building the home and raised their three children there, with Mr. Larkin splitting his time between Florida and the Cincinnati area, where he played for the Cincinnati Reds.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to raise my kids in Cincinnati because I didn\u2019t want them to grow up with the pressures of being the son or daughter of a prominent sports figure in the town,\u201d Mr. Larkin said. The Larkins said they\u2019ve never been uptight about the house, and designed it to be open plan so that their children could run around freely. They even allowed them to skateboard through it.\n\nThe couple began marketing the home for sale for $10.9 million in 2012, once their children had mostly grown up. (Their youngest is now 22.) It has undergone several price cuts since then, and was most recently taken off the market in September 2018, priced at $5.9 million. The couple plan to move to a smaller home in South Florida.\n\nMr. Larkin played shortstop for the Cincinnati Reds from 1986 to 2004 and later served as an analyst for ESPN. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nMark Santolin of Engel & V\u00f6lkers Orlando Winter Park has the listing.\n\nWrite to Katherine Clarke at katherine.clarke@wsj.com", "description": "The former Cincinnati Reds shortstop is relisting his eccentric Windermere home for $5.4 million.", "authors": ["Katherine Clarke", "Katherine.Clarke Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106737/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
