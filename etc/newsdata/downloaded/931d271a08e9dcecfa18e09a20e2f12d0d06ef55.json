The frock strongly resembles the satin wonder that fashion publicist Carolyn Bessette wore when she wed John F Kennedy Jr in 1996.\n\nA lovely look: Hailey Baldwin was seen in a third dress at her Monday wedding to Justin Bieber in this image shared by the singer's manager Scooter Braun\n\nFamiliar feel: The frock strongly resembles the satin wonder that fashion publicist Carolyn Bessette wore when she wed John F Kennedy Jr in 1996\n\nThese new images were shared by Bieber's manager Scooter Braun on Instagram but then quickly taken down.\n\nIt is the only look at the third dress so far.\n\nWhen Hailey went to the church at the Montage Palmetto Bluffs in South Carolina on Monday, she was in a box with a white tent around it to prevent photographer's from getting a good look at her wedding gown.\n\nA very alluring look: The dress showed off her chest and had very thin straps; the number also hugged her cover girl curves\n\nThe dynamic duo: Here Bessette and Kennedy Jr are seen in 1996; they died in a plane crash in July 1999 off Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts\n\nBut Page Six published images of Baldwin in her wedding gown from the chest up.\n\nThere was also a veil placed back on her head with her hair up and diamond Tiffany & Co earrings worth $123,000 on.
