Scandrick had started the game against Dallas, but played only half of the defensive snaps.\n\nOn Friday, he was on FS1\u2019s \u201cUndisputed\u201d and aired some dirty laundry with his now-former team, taking particular aim at general manager Howie Roseman and safety Malcolm Jenkins.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHere are some of the highlights; video of the full interview is below.\n\nHow surprised were you that the Eagles let you go?, host Skip Bayless began.\n\nOrlando Scandrick aired some dirty laundry on FS1 on Friday. (Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cVery surprised. I had a productive game coming back against the Jets and we go up to Minnesota and we get smashed and we go to Dallas and we get smashed and it felt kind of scapegoat-ish. ...I mean, I didn\u2019t have my best performance [against Dallas], I had some rough moments but who doesn\u2019t have rough moments in this league? But It felt really, really scapegoat-ish. The problem in Philadelphia is much deeper than me.\u201d\n\nShannon Sharpe asked if Scandrick wanted to elaborate.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re having a tough time dealing with success. Whenever you gotta say, \u2018oh, we\u2019re going to get it together.\u2019 \u2018Oh, no one believes in us.\u2019 \u2018Oh, it\u2019s about us,\u2019 you already don\u2019t,\u201d have answers, Scandrick said.\n\nScandrick was asked if he was given a reason why he was released and made it clear he\u2019s not a fan of Roseman.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cHow it was explained to me from Howie - and I don\u2019t believe anything that Howie says - Howie is one of he people that if he told me it was raining outside, I\u2019d probable get some shorts just in case. He put it to me as they wanted to play some younger players, and they\u2019re a mess on defense and hey needed to get some more defensive linemen, so we\u2019ll see how that works out in Buffalo this weekend,\u201d he said.\n\nLast week, there was a report from ESPN\u2019s Josina Anderson that cited an unnamed Eagles player who criticized quarterback Carson Wentz\u2019s play. WIP reporter Howard Eskin tried to out receiver Alshon Jeffrey as Anderson\u2019s source, which both Jeffrey and Anderson denied was the case.\n\nScandrick said he takes Jeffrey at his word.\n\n\u201cI love Alshon, and I\u2019m a take it for what he said, it wasn\u2019t him, but it came from somewhere,\u201d Scandrick said. \u201cOnce again, where there\u2019s smoke there\u2019s fire. That locker room is different. I would tell guys when I came there, I still feel like they\u2019re living on that Super Bowl high. It\u2019s over. You\u2019re living in the past. Some of those guys came in the league and they experienced was 13-3 and the Super Bowl and they think that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nScandrick looked at Sharpe. \u201cHow many years you play in the league?\u201d he asked. \u201cFourteen,\u201d Sharpe said. \u201cHow many Super Bowls?\u201d Scandrick asked. \u201cThree,\u201d Sharpe said. \u201cHow hard was it to get there?\u201d Scandrick said. The 11 years when he did make it to the Super Bowl weren\u2019t successful, Sharpe said.\n\n\u201cAnd for me, 12 years, no super bowl, no Super Bowl appearances. And some of those guys, they haven\u2019t even faced the harsh reality of a losing season,\u201d Scandrick said. \u201cBut at this rate, what\u2019s going on there - the problem is not just fixable by saying \u2018we\u2019re all going to stick together.\u2019 You say, \u2018we\u2019re all going to stick together, we\u2019re all in this together.\u2019 But then you get Lane [Johnson] saying people\u2019s late to meetings. There\u2019s some accountability issues there and it starts at the top.\u201d\n\nWhen Sharpe noted that he had a problem with Johnson publicly saying after the loss to Dallas that teammates were late to meetings, Scandrick agreed.\n\n\u201cI was just talking about that to somebody. Why not go to that guy and tell them on the plane?\u201d Scandrick said. \u201cBut for me, that was like a masking thing. Lane is a hell of a player, we all can agree with that. He didn\u2019t have a hell of a game on Sunday.\n\n\u201cSo instead of going out and attacking somebody being late, the first thing you could have done was looked in the mirror and maybe went to that guy and pulled him to the side and say, \u2018hey, we can\u2019t be late. We gotta get this together, we gotta set examples, we\u2019re the vets on this team.\u2019 Because they\u2019re not talking about a rookie being late, they\u2019re not talking about some guy that\u2019s just a 52nd, 53rd guy on the roster, some guy that doesn\u2019t play being late. That comment is about somebody of some significance [but he doesn\u2019t know who it was] the comment was made, I was cut the next day.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Johnson said on Friday that Scandrick was accurate in his assessment, and he shouldn\u2019t have said what he said on Sunday.\n\nAfter some questions about how Wentz is handling the pressure of being the Eagles\u2019 leader, Scandrick called the quarterback \u201ca great guy...stand up,\u201d and then things turned to the state of the Philly defense.\n\n\u201cI think on defense they\u2019ve stuck together pretty good. There\u2019s some selfish people on that defense though. Absolutely. I think Rasul Douglas, who\u2019s a good friend of mine, I think he took some unwanted heat for some blown coverages on some other people\u2019s selfish play. And we don\u2019t even have to say names at all; they know who they are,\u201d Scandrick said.\n\nBayless made it clear they were discussing Jenkins.\n\n\u201cI think that when you wear a \u2018C\u2019 on your jersey [as a captain], it\u2019s your job to bring guys along, it\u2019s your job that sometimes you have to take [the heat], and you need to bring the thing together,\u201d Scandrick said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case. You look at everything that happened - you hold out for a contract, you\u2019re not making any plays, any splash plays, then you go down to Minnesota and you somehow supposed to be on a half of the field and you end up playing a crosser? That\u2019s not a rookie we\u2019re talking about here. It\u2019s a two-time Super Bowl champ.\u201d\n\nMedia that cover the Eagles had locker room access after Scandrick\u2019s interview aired, and of course asked Jenkins about what his now-former teammate said.\n\n\u201cI could give two [expletive] about people who aren\u2019t here,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cFor us to move on as a team, we can\u2019t have [expletive] like that in here.\u201d\n\nScandrick was also asked about Eagles coach Doug Pederson, who early last week said during a radio interview that the Eagles were headed to Dallas to win and take first place in the NFC East, then immediately (and foolishly) backtracked on his own confident words.\n\n\u201cThat whole thing was strange, man,\u201d Scandrick said. \u201cJust being part of that Dallas Cowboy organization for so long [Scandrick was drafted by Dallas in 2008 and played there for 10 years], then going and being part of two other organizations, I never really felt at home.\n\n\u201cIf I could take back one thing or one regret that I have in my whole entire sports career, it would have been to stay with that Dallas Cowboy organization through thick and thin. I had a long, long conversation with Sean Lee before the game, on the phone, me and Sean are great friends, we had a long conversation that wasn\u2019t even about football, it just was about his loyalty to Dallas and how I was happy for him for grinding though and being healthy and continuing to fight despite what everyone said about him and he was telling me he loves it. he love s being in Dallas, the work that he\u2019s put in with those guys, he loves going to work every day, and I can\u2019t say my last two years were like that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Scandrick was not a fan of his time with the Eagles.", "authors": ["Shalise Manza Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/C3lkvrpQuk2MD02.bftswA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.SE7uzJFGOvOnDSHYd5TgA--~B/aD0yNTMxO3c9Mzc5NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/333f1f90-f750-11e9-bf57-f82f4c4f25c8", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
