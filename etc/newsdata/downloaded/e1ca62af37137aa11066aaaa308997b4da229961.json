Washington manager Dave Martinez, still enraged at umpires, was ejected during the seventh-inning stretch, screaming as a pair of his coaches held him back while the crowd sang along to \u201cDeep in the Heart of Texas.\u201d Rendon added a two-run double off Chris Devenski in the ninth.\n\nNationals pitcher Max Scherzer, boosted by an injection of painkiller, is primed to return from an irritated nerve in his neck to start Game 7, Martinez said before the game. Scherzer was warming up in the seventh before Rendon\u2019s homer, then sat down as Martinez became the first manager tossed from a Series game since Atlanta\u2019s Bobby Cox in 1996.\n\nNow the Nationals will attempt their ultimate comeback in a year in which they were written off time after time, hoping for the first title in the 51-season history of a franchise that started as the Montreal Expos and the first for Washington since the Senators in 1924. Zack Greinke will be on the mound for the Astros, who led the majors with 107 wins and are seeking their second title in three seasons.\n\nVisiting teams have won three straight Game 7s in the Series since the Cardinals defeated Texas at home in 2011.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Stephen Strasburg took a gem into the ninth inning and Juan Soto ran all the way to first base with his bat following a go-ahead home run, the same way Houston slugger Alex Bregman did earlier.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ronald Blum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/world_series_nationals_astros_baseball_43668_c0-151-3633-2270_s1200x700.jpg?d7dbd593d5914d7f77045e8d3122e448da974803", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
