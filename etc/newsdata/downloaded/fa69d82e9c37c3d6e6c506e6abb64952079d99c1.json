Overall, sales grew to $3.83 billion from $3.82 billion a year earlier, below the $3.89 billion analysts polled by FactSet had expected for the quarter.\n\nPPG reported a profit of $367 million, or $1.54 a share, compared with $378 million, or $1.55 a share, a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting earnings of $1.61 a share. Excluding one-time costs, the company posted an adjusted profit of $1.67 a share.\n\n\"As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate global economic growth will remain soft impacting several end-use markets,\" company Chief Executive Michael McGarry said. \"Many of our customers remain cautious about their ordering patterns and inventory levels,\" he said.\n\nLast month, the company reached a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to close an investigation into accounting irregularities at the company without paying a fine.\n\nThe paint maker fired its controller last year after it uncovered what it said were multiple instances of improperly adjusted financial metrics.\n\nWrite to Patrick Thomas at Patrick.Thomas@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 07:49 ET (11:49 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
