Oh, it was because it was international break week and there wasn\u2019t any domestic action. International week meant taking a break from more referees\u2019 mistakes.\n\nThis is not a joke, but rather the sad state of affairs of South African football.\n\nThis is not the first time poor officiating has reared its ugly head \u2013 and it will definitely not be the last.\n\nIf anything, the opening quarter of the season was characterised by match officials\u2019 below-par performances and this can\u2019t be business as usual.\n\nYes, a few have been punished, but is this the real solution to the root cause of the problem?\n\nSome coaches have already lost their jobs because of some questionable and dubious decisions.\n\nTwo assistant referees have been sanctioned following some poor decisions that affected the outcomes of matches.\n\nAssistant referee Mervyn van Wyk, who officiated in the AmaZulu versus Kaizer Chiefs league fixture on Heritage Day, has been sanctioned for four weeks of non-appointment in NSL matches.\n\nRead: Erratic match official loses his Fifa badge\n\nA similar penalty was imposed on Athuxolo Madela, who manned the line during the Chiefs versus Baroka match last month. The pair will be eligible to officiate only in regional league matches.\n\nThe problem with Safa is that it is more reactive than proactive.\n\nBy demoting the duo, Safa bowed to public pressure and played to the gallery.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Safa say anything about Shaun Oliver after his mistake in the game between Cape Town City and Chiefs in August?\n\nTo refresh your memory, Oliver is the assistant ref who ruled out Khama Billiat\u2019s legitimate goal.\n\nIs it because it was not a game-changing decision at the end of the match as Chiefs went on to win the game, or is it because people did not make a noise about this dubious decision?\n\nA wrong is a wrong, and this was the wrong call.\n\nI\u2019m told Oliver was sanctioned, but this was not communicated to the public. How do we know if this indeed was the case?\n\nAnother problem is with Safa\u2019s referees\u2019 department: Is it selective or is it preferential treatment of officials?\n\nThe problem with Safa is that it is more reactive than proactive.\n\nWe are still waiting for answers on what happened to Victor Gomes following his mistake in a game between Golden Arrows and AmaZulu last season.\n\n\n\nOkay, sanction officials, but then what? Do they come back better? What happens to them psychologically when they are banished to the lower leagues?\n\nI was glad to hear Safa saying it assigned senior match commissioners to help them get better. But is this really happening?\n\nI think we need to call a spade a spade and point out where the problem is \u2013 someone at Safa wanted to become a hero by promoting these young and inexperienced officials en masse.\n\nAs one former ref told me, you can\u2019t use a microwave for cooking and expect the same results as if you were cooking on a proper stove.\n\nA quick glance at the panel shows a handful of experienced match officials \u2013 not more than five.\n\nThe former official said: \u201cIt took me more than six years to break into the premier division, but officials are parachuted to the top these days because someone wants to take the glory to Safa and say that Safa\u2019s development is working. The fact is, you can\u2019t substitute experience and the sooner Safa realises that, the better.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nAs we go back to the domestic action next weekend, one can only hope (underline hope) that poor officiating is a thing of the past \u2013 gone with the international break. We can only hope and wish. But knowing our officials and their obsession with the limelight, they might be back with a bang and continue where they left off. I hope not.\n\n. timothy@citypress.co.za\n\n.Follow me on Twitter @TimspiritMolobi", "description": "Match officials are ruining our football, and something has to be done about it.", "authors": ["Timothy Molobi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9320/3c9dadac64bd4d728d4c8f8df85f0a1d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
