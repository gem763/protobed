What's your story? How come you're not ''the Artist'' already?' he asked her, as he listened to her duet with Elise Azkoul, 28, on Ariana Grande's 2018 hit Breathin'.\n\nMyracle teared up, saying: 'You can have a great gift, but if you don't deal with your stuff, your childhood stuff, and the stuff that you're going through, it'll catch up to you sooner or later.'\n\nShe once toured with Earth, Wind & Fire singer Philip Bailey, but experienced domestic violence and substance abuse that encouraged her 'to take a break from music,' she said.\n\nWill.i.am was startled to learn that Myracle graduated high school the year before him, attending Susan Miller Dorsey High School in South Central Los Angeles, less than 10 miles from his home.\n\nGreat gift: Elise Azkoul and Myracle were thrilled to meet Will.i.am\n\n'We come from the same place,' the singer and producer mused, getting choked up.\n\n'Why do I have a career and she doesn't have a career? She has the chops. She has the experience. But I don't think she understands how empowered she is,' he added.\n\n'Emotional intelligence coupled with amazing singing is really powerful,' offered Will.i.am, a former judge on The Voice UK. 'And you guys are both spot-on 10s.'\n\nSame place: The Black Eyed Peas singer got choked up after learning that Myracle also was a Los Angeles native whose promising career had been sidetracked\n\nAfter hearing their delicate performance of the song, judge Kelly Clarkson, 37, praised Myracle's ability to sing from her heart, noting it was something that couldn't be taught.\n\n'Myracle, you're not wasting your pain, and it's so inspiring,' Gwen, 50, agreed, choosing her.\n\nThe evening kicked off with a soulful battle between singers Injoy Fountain, 29, and Alex Guthrie, 25, who performed a cover of the 2004 Marc Broussard song Home.\n\nThe coach: Gwen declared Myracle the winner of her battle against Elise\n\n'Pairing people for the battles is the hardest,' opined Kelly, their coach. 'You think you know what kind of vocalist they are, and then they come in, and you're like, ''Well, I shouldn't have paired y'all''.'\n\nInjoy, who'd once toured the world with the musical Rent, had a lot at stake in the battle, she said, having downsized her youthful dreams to 'pay the bills and feed me and my child.'\n\n'I don't ever want my kid to see me give up, or know what struggle is,' she shared.\n\nTough pairing: Injoy Fountain and Alex Guthrie were paired against each other by coach Kelly Clarkson\n\nPop star: Normani was serving as special advisor to Kelly and her singers during the Battle Rounds\n\nHer competition, a former grunge artist, sang more softly but with great verve.\n\n'Being with Alex is intimidating, because he is so good and he has so many tricks up his sleeve,' Injoy admitted. 'But it also makes me step up to the plate.'\n\nThe duo's barn-burner of a song had the judges grinning, and Blake Shelton, 42, praised the way Injoy was 'slapping the song around a little bit,' saying Alex needed to be 'more aggressive.'\n\nDynamic duo: Injoy rehearsed their cover of the 2004 Marc Broussard song Home with Kelly and Normani\n\nKilled i: The duo's barn-burner of a song had the judges grinning\n\nSlapping around: Blake Shelton, 42, praised the way Injoy was 'slapping the song around a little bit' during her Battle Rounds performance\n\nKelly disagreed, and picked Alex because he was so versatile, and could better 'round out her team'.\n\nThe American Idol winner did however tell the departing Injoy: 'I'm literally in love with both of you.'\n\nIn battles that were only briefly shown, the judges made more tough decisions.\n\nThe moment: The Voice host Carson Daly stood between Alex and Injoy as they awaited their fate\n\nTough pick: Kelly bucked the consensu and picked Alex because he was so versatile and could better 'round out her team'\n\nBlake picked kickboxer Cali Wilson, 28, over dairy farmer EllieMae, 21, after hearing Cali's performance of Kelsea Ballerini's Miss Me More and enjoying her 'attitude and personality.'\n\nJohn Legend, 40, chose new college grad Max Boyle, 23, over father-of-two Matt New, 29, raving about the 'electricity' in Max's voice when he sang DJ Snake's Let Me Love You.\n\nTwo members of John's team would battle again during the night, with 'subtle' singer Destiny Rayne, 23, squaring off against 'big voice' Katie Kadan, 38, on Elton John's 1971 classic Tiny Dancer.\n\nBriefly shown: Blake picked kickboxer Cali Wilson, 28, over dairy farmer EllieMae, 21, after hearing Cali's performance of Kelsea Ballerini's Miss Me More\n\nQuick clip: John Legend, 40, chose new college grad Max Boyle, 23, over father-of-two Matt New, 29, raving about the 'electricity' in Max's voice when he sang DJ Snake's Let Me Love You\n\nAs a teenager, Katie had a huge crush on John's adviser, the singer Usher, 41.\n\nKatie as soon as she saw him she started rapping to him, saying 'Gimme a second, I think I'm gonna faint.'\n\n'I wanted to gaze in his eyes a little bit, but I thought that might be kind of creeper,' said Katie, who played in five bands back home in Chicago.\n\nFormer coach: Usher was helping John Legend with his singers during the Battle Rounds\n\nBig fans: Destiny Rayne and Katie Kadan rehearsed Tiny Dancer with John and Usher\n\n'She's really special,' Usher noted. 'This is like a long-awaited and anticipated moment for her.'\n\n'It is intimidating doing a song that's so iconic against someone who has four chairs. I'm not gonna lie,' Destiny admitted.\n\nThe pair's intense, growly rendition of the song had all of the judges standing and clapping, with Gwen saying: 'Well, you've got everyone in shock. We have shock eyes.'\n\nClassic song: The singers faced off to the Elton John song during their battle\n\n'Katie's tone. It's just hard to believe that it's a real voice,' she continued, saying she'd make the woman her pick. 'It's so full of life and personality.'\n\n'You belong making records,' John told Katie, calling her a 'superstar.' 'People need to see you and hear you.'\n\nHe chose Katie, but both Gwen and Blake tried to steal Destiny at the last minute.\n\nHard choice: Destiny, Carson and Katie waited to hear who John would name as the winner\n\nHigh praise: John called Katie a 'superstar' and named her as the winner\n\nDouble steal: Blake and Gwen both moved to steal Destiny\n\n'You know, Destiny,' Blake began, 'I don't want to fight with my girlfriend, but I'm willing to for you.'\n\n'I have won this show more seasons than Gwen has been a coach,' he pointed out.\n\n'Maybe he has the most wins on this show, but I have the longest career,' Gwen countered, prompting Destiny to pick her.\n\nFinger point: Gwen borrowed her boyfriend's signature move and pointed at herself as Destiny deliberated\n\n'You broke up America's couple!' Blake teased the young woman.\n\n'Blake was almost sleeping on the couch tonight, so Destiny made the right choice,' Gwen replied.\n\nThe Voice will return Monday on NBC as the Battle Rounds continue.", "description": "The 44-year-old singer had an emotional moment on Tuesday's episode of The Voice as he marveled at how little separated him from a contestant in the battle rounds.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/05/19772808-0-image-a-61_1571201311618.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
