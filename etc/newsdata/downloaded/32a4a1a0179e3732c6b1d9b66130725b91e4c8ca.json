Good luck to everyone else.\n\nIt went about as well as you might expect, with Dobnak \u2014 a great story, a great find by the Twins\u2019 scouting staff and by all accounts a prince of a guy, but making just his sixth big league start \u2014 getting torched by the Yankees\u2019 relentless lineup for six hits and four earned runs in two-plus innings. What followed was an 8-2 Yankees victory that gives them a 2-0 lead in the series, with Game 3 on Monday at Minneapolis\u2019s Target Field.\n\nBy the time Dobnak was Lyfted \u2014 er, lifted \u2014 three batters into the third inning, with the Twins trailing 1-0, he had loaded the bases on two singles and a walk. Right-hander Tyler Duffey entered and went sacrifice fly (by Giancarlo Stanton), RBI single (Gleyber Torres), hit by pitch (Gary Sanchez), grand slam (Didi Gregorious). All four events occurred after Duffey had been ahead either 0-2 or 1-2 in the count; he has now inherited five base runners in the series, and all five have come around to score.\n\nSo what in the world were the Twins thinking with the choice of Dobnak \u2014 again, great guy, great story, great Uber rating \u2014 in Game 2? You can blame two things: Michael Pineda, and home run hysteria.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis probably should have been Pineda\u2019s game, had the veteran right-hander not been suspended 60 games in September \u2014 at which point he was 6-1 with a 2.88 ERA in his previous 10 starts \u2014 after testing positive for a banned diuretic. By then it was too late for the Twins to go out and acquire another starter.\n\nThe Twins still could have gone with veteran right-hander Jake Odorizzi, 15-7 with a 3.51 ERA and an all-star this season. To understand why they didn\u2019t, you have to remember how consumed the sports is with home runs \u2014 for hitters, hitting them; and for pitchers, preventing them \u2014 at the end of a season that saw by far the most home runs (6,776) in history. That is especially true in this series, which features the two most prolific homer-hitting offenses in history \u2014 the Twins with 307, the Yankees with 306.\n\nIt is only a slight exaggeration to say whichever team harnessed the homer in this matchup \u2014 hitting them, and not giving them up \u2014 would be the one that advanced to the AL Championship Series.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDobnak, then, had one important trait going for him, as far as the Twins\u2019 management was concerned: he kept the ball on the ground. In 28\u2153 big league innings, he gave up just one homer, producing a 52.9 percent groundball rate, which would have ranked fifth in the majors if he had compiled enough innings to qualify.\n\nThat\u2019s what the numbers said. But on a human level, sending Dobnak into the intimidating atmosphere of Yankee Stadium in what was at that point the biggest game of the Twins\u2019 season in hindsight seems unfair. The loss was the Twins\u2019 15th consecutive in the postseason, with 12 of those coming to the Yankees.\n\nThat horrid history doesn\u2019t matter as much as everyone claims \u2014 only seven players on this year\u2019s Twins roster were on the team that lost the 2017 AL wild card game to the Yankees, and nobody remains from the 2004 team that lost to New York in the Division Series. But on a certain level, it becomes part of the intimidation factor when this franchise steps into that stadium.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the Twins\u2019 plan to keep the Yankees\u2019 hitters from leaving the ballpark blew up spectacularly, when Gregorius sent a 94-mph fastball from Duffey into the bleachers in right for a grand slam, the Yankees \u2014 after giving up three homers in Friday night\u2019s 10-4 win \u2014 fared much better against the Twins\u2019 storied \u201cBomba Squad,\u201d thanks to Masahiro Tanaka and four relievers.\n\nLike Dobnak for the Twins, Tanaka, a 30-year-old right-hander who made his second all-star team this summer, was a logical choice on paper to start this game. The Twins had the majors\u2019 highest batting average (. 294) and second-highest slugging percentage (. 537) against fastballs, but Tanaka threw the second-fewest fastballs of any qualified starter in the game (30.5 percent of his overall pitches).\n\nBut what Tanaka had over Dobnak, of course, was the pedigree and postseason r\u00e9sum\u00e9. His five solid innings \u2014 in which he allowed just three hits, one walk and one run while striking out seven \u2014 pushed him to 4-2 with a 1.54 ERA in six playoff starts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Twins now are in an awful spot. Even if they survive Game 3, with Odorizzi facing Yankees right-hander Luis Severino, they don\u2019t have a starter lined up for Game 4 \u2014 their choices coming down to ace Jose Berrios on short rest, or what amounts to a bullpen game.\n\nWould things have been different if the Twins had gone with Odorizzi instead of Dobnak in Game 2? We\u2019ll never know. But home run hysteria is a dangerous thing \u2014 which sometimes can make a smart team outthink itself.\n\nRead more on the MLB playoffs:\n\nNative American Cardinals pitcher takes issue with Braves\u2019 tomahawk chop\n\nHow to stream the entire MLB postseason\n\nFour months after being shot, David Ortiz is back on air for Fox\n\nLow-budget Rays bust into postseason with high-priced behemoths\n\nHouston\u2019s mattress king lays a big bet on the Astros to go all the way\n\nAD", "description": "Randy Dobnak has a nice story, but his playoff moment in the Bronx may have been too big for him.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UhK1TGmZBmigAJi-tqPq5XmjgQU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TJ5NJCXH3MI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
