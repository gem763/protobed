The site, which operated from June 2015 to March 2018, had a message on its landing page explicitly warning users to \u201cnot upload adult porn.\u201d\n\nInvestigators found almost eight terabytes of footage showing the sexual abuse of children on the site, including videos depicting infants being raped. Almost half of the videos contained \u201cnew images that have not been previously known to exist,\u201d the Justice Department said.\n\nUsers of the site could buy \u201cpoints\u201d with the digital currency Bitcoin, which they could use to download videos or purchase all-you-can watch \u201cVIP\u201d accounts, Reuters reported. Users could also earn points by uploading new videos to the site.\n\nThe site processed 7,300 Bitcoin transactions worth at least $370,000, officials said.\n\n\u201cDarknet sites that profit from the sexual exploitation of children are among the most vile and reprehensible forms of criminal behavior,\u201d Brian Benczkowski, assistant attorney general for Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement demonstrates that the Department of Justice remains firmly committed to working closely with our partners in South Korea and around the world to rescue child victims and bring to justice the perpetrators of these abhorrent crimes.\u201d\n\nDOJ The message posted on the Welcome to Video website after it was seized by authorities.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, U.S., British and South Korean agents arrested Jong Woo Son, a South Korean citizen, in his home country in March 2018 and seized the server he\u2019d used to operate the video marketplace.\n\nSon is currently serving an 18-month prison sentence on charges related to child pornography, Reuters reported. He was also indicted on federal child pornography charges in Washington in August. That indictment was unsealed on Wednesday.\n\nIt remains unclear whether there are plans to extradite Son to face the charges in the United States. Jessie Liu, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said this week that she could not comment on \u201cwhat may be happening with respect to extradition,\u201d NBC reported.\n\nA South Korean national, Jong Woo Son, 23, has been indicted by U.S. authorities on charges of running one of the world\u2019s largest markets for child pornography that accepts Bitcoin https://t.co/hDFef6400W pic.twitter.com/78FTVJBE8y \u2014 Sam Kim (@samkimasia) October 17, 2019\n\nThe Justice Department listed at least 34 suspected users of Welcome To Video who were arrested in the United States. These include a 45-year-old D.C. man named Nicholas Stengel who was accused of downloading more than 450,000 hours of videos showing child sexual abuse; and Richard Gratkowski, a 40-year-old former Homeland Security Investigations agent, who was sentenced earlier this year to 70 months in prison on child pornography charges.\n\nThe department said the global operation had also led to the rescue of at least 23 children living in the U.S., Spain and the U.K. who were being \u201cactively abused by the users of the site.\u201d\n\nOfficials said the successful enforcement operation should serve as a warning to child sex offenders that they cannot escape justice \u2015 not even on the dark web.\n\n\u201cDark web child sex offenders \u2013 some of whom are the very worst offenders \u2013 cannot hide from law enforcement,\u201d Nikki Holland, director of the U.K.\u2019s National Crime Agency, said in a statement. \u201dThey\u2019re not as cloaked as they think they are, they\u2019re not as safe as they think they are.\u201d", "description": "The 23-year-old man accused of running the site, as well as hundreds of suspected users, have been arrested, U.S., British and South Korean officials said.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da8256a2000000210505ef7.png?cache=mafqzgyylo&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
