But is the feeling mutual?", "language": "en", "text": "Advice columnist\n\nAdapted from a recent online discussion.\n\nDear Carolyn: Being totally in love is overrated. I have never felt that intensely about my husband and do not love him as much as I've loved exes. I certainly don't get along with my husband as well as I did with one particular ex.\n\nBut you know what? The men I did love that way either lied to me, hurt me, \"borrowed\" money, stood me up, left me with wedding deposits I never got back, made promises they never kept. My husband has never done those things.\n\nI don't look at my marriage as a loss. I look at it as though the spouse I really wanted simply doesn't exist.\n\nI think the temptation to take advantage of a partner's strong feelings and trust is a pull too hard for many people to resist. I dated A LOT. Any man I felt in love with or had strong feelings for did something terrible that involved taking advantage of my feelings.\n\nI married the reliable man who isn't going to swear he'll attend my friend's wedding and then no-show. Life isn't a fairy tale.\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis for The Washington Post)\n\n\u2014 No Fairy Tale\n\nNo Fairy Tale: No, it isn\u2019t.\n\nBut does your husband know this, or enough of it to know you weren\u2019t swept away? If he doesn\u2019t, then he\u2019s essentially paying for the crimes of your more intense loves of the past. Which is not okay.\n\nIf he does know, especially if the feeling is mutual \u2014 that you represent calm affection and security vs. the love of his life (whatever that means to you) \u2014 then that\u2019s a whole other thing, and mazel tov to you both.\n\nIf anyone\u2019s thinking ignorance is bliss, then you need to factor in the way people respond to someone they love-love vs. just like a lot (or barely tolerate). The person you love-love always gets more warmth, better listening, softer landings from missteps. Right?\n\nSo take these small emotional exchanges, and multiply them by a marriage\u2019s worth of days. The result is a lifetime of less-than, which a secretly settled-for spouse never got a chance to agree to \u2014 or walk away from. So profoundly unfair.\n\nRe: Fairy tale: This made me think of \"Sleepless in Seattle,\" where Bill Pullman's character replies to getting dumped: \"I don't want to be someone that you're settling for. I don't want to be someone that anyone settles for. Marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?\" I always thought that was classy, but I also thought he knew he was dodging a HUGE bullet.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: Yessss.\n\nAnd Bill Pullman scenes, come on. That\u2019s like getting a smiley sticker on my math test.\n\nTo: Fairy tale: You sound pretty angry still, and I wonder if that spills over into your relationship. It might be worth unpacking your feelings about these exes (which sound like excitement, infatuation, but not love). Who knows \u2014 if you do this, you might discover you do, indeed, love your husband. But if you don't, think about whether you'd want to be with someone who wrote about you as if you were a dependable piece of furniture.\n\n\u2014 Wondering\n\nRe: Fairy tale: As the guy who somebody settled for, I second what CH said. Better to never get married.\n\n\u2014 Guy\n\nGuy: I\u2019m sorry.", "description": "Her husband shouldn\u2019t pay for what exes did in the past.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "October At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
