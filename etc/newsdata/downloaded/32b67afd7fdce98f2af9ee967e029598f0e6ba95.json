Now is the time for House Democrats to open up the process and let the American public see the full extent of Trump\u2019s criminal behavior. Holding public impeachment hearings will ensure the crimes committed by him and those around him come out from the shadows and onto the national stage. It will also put pressure on Senate Republicans by showing voters in their states the true extent of this president\u2019s impeachable offenses. The process started with the American people raising their voices and demanding Trump be held accountable, and it will end with the removal of the most lawless president in our nation\u2019s history if Congress makes all of the evidence publicly available.\n\nRepublicans also want the \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d made public \u2014 though they believe it will exonerate rather than implicate the president. The White House is refusing to cooperate with the inquiry until the House holds a formal vote authorizing it, as has been done with previous presidents.\n\nJoel B.
