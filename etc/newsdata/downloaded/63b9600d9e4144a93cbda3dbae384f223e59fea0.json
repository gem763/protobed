Last year, it was ranked at No. 5. source Aneoho/Shutterstock\n\nU.S. News & World Report released its rankings for the best countries to invest in this year.\n\nThose rankings were determined by 7,000 worldwide business decision makers who scored each country on eight attributes, including entrepreneurship, economic stability, and favorable tax environment.\n\nThe list differs greatly from last year\u2019s; three of this year\u2019s top five countries were not even ranked last year.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nTo qualify as a country worthy of investment, certain standards must be met.\n\nA World Bank Group report in 2011 highlighted four factors \u2013 the country\u2019s people, environment, relationships, and framework \u2013 that propel both individuals and corporations to invest in a given country\u2019s natural resources, markets, technologies, or brands.\n\nGuided by this report, U.S. News & World Report identified the best countries to invest in for 2019.\n\nTo determine the overall list, U.S. News & World Report surveyed over 21,000 people worldwide about 80 different countries, measuring them on 65 different attributes, including cultural influence, entrepreneurship, and quality of life.\n\nRead more: The 20 best countries around the world to live as an expat, ranked\n\nU.S. News focused on just eight of the 65 attributes: entrepreneurship, economic stability, favorable tax environment, innovation, skilled labor, technological expertise, dynamism, and corruption. Responses from over 7,000 survey participants \u2013 who act as decision makers in business around the globe \u2013 were then used to determine the ranking.\n\nThe most recent survey produced a completely different ranking last year; in 2018, the top five countries for investment were the Philippines, Indonesia, Poland, Malaysia, and Singapore. See below for this year\u2019s rankings, with the country\u2019s population and GDP (from U.S. News & World Report) and the GDP growth percentage in 2018 (from The World Bank).\n\n20.
