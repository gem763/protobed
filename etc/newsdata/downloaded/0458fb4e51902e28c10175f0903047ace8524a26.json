In a house about 10 minutes from where the attack happened, an organization called Border Network for Human Rights is hosting what in Spanish is called a \"charla,\" or a chat, giving a chance for people to talk about how they are feeling.\n\nDulce Carlos is leading the conversation with multiple generations of El Paso residents, including Mexican immigrants.\n\n\"I feel that my heart is broken,\" said Guillermo Adame through a translator.\n\nAdame has lived in El Paso for 50 years. He was on his way to the Walmart the morning of the largest terrorist attack on Latinos in modern history.\n\nMultiple generations of El Paso residents discuss the shooting at the Walmart.

I'm scared,\" said Ermelinda Blanco in Spanish.\n\nThe whole room raised their hands when asked if they feel actual fear about what happened \u2014 and they all said they have never felt this way before.\n\nOne woman said her daughter was watching and asking what was happening, but she \"didn't know how to explain it to her.\"\n\nThe conversation also turned to President Trump.\n\nUS President Donald Trump greets first responders as he visits El Paso Regional Communications Center in El Paso, Texas, August 7, 2019, following last weekend's mass shootings.

You're talking to a group of people who feel that they could be a target because of nothing else other than the color of their skin, their immigration status, who they are. You really got a sense of how palpable the fear is now. Those were really powerful, really sad, words to hear.\n\nFor now, this community leans on each other.", "description": "A whole room raised their hands when asked if they feel actual fear about what happened \u2014 and they all said they have never felt this way before", "authors": ["Manuel Bojorquez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/08/dfc34916-4286-4a41-b01a-0c47d2249af0/thumbnail/1200x630/9f4aef38d6dfb9fd5e1a6edb8ff2befa/0808-en-latinoelpaso-bojorquez-2.jpg"}
