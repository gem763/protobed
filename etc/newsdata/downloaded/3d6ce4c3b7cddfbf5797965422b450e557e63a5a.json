Its complaints at the United Nations were issued in the context of President Donald Trump\u2019s 2018 decision to pull out of the 2015 Obama administration\u2019s nuclear accord with Iran, Russia, China, Britain, France, and Germany.\n\nThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the deal is officially known, required Iran to limit its nuclear development in exchange for sanctions relief. Tehran repeatedly violated the terms of the deal, leading to Trump reimposing sanctions.\n\nIran\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs Gholamhossein Dehghani began a meeting on the outside of the U.N. General Assembly\u2019s general debate \u2014 the major hall speeches by all attending heads of state \u2014 on \u201cInternational Day for the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons\u201d by urging the world to strip America of its nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cNo one should possess nuclear weapons to target others,\u201d he asserted, according to the Iranian Tasnim news agency, \u201cand before they [nuclear weapons] can destroy us, we must destroy them.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo accomplish this goal, the nuclear-weapon states must comply with their legal obligations under Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,\u201d he said.\n\nIran offered to keep its end of the deal this month regardless of U.S. participation in exchange for freedom to sell oil on the open market \u2014 or payments totaling $15 billion.\n\nIran has repeatedly violated the nuclear deal, as certified by United Nations inspectors. When confronted with its violations, the Islamic regime has claimed that those violations conform to the terms of the deal.\n\nTrump has taken a hardline stance against Iran from the very beginning of his term \u2014 and even before that, despite international resistance. His son, Eric Trump, went so far as to claim the aforementioned 2015 deal with Iran was a primary motivator in his run for POTUS. Trump himself called pulling out of that deal a \u201cnumber one priority.\u201d", "description": "At the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, an Iran representative pushed for nuclear disarmament.", "authors": ["Nate Church"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Dehghani1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
