But I am here in front of my inspirations,\u201d said Jerome, a New Yorker whose mother told him about this ugly chapter in city history.\n\nHe then acknowledged the Central Park Five - Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise - who had been invited.\n\n\u201cThis is for Raymond, Yusef, Antron, Kevin, and King Korey Wise. Thank you so much, it\u2019s an honor. It\u2019s a blessing,\u201d said Jerome.\n\nSome of the men raised fists in the air, while others, including Wise, had tears in their eyes. Jerome played Wise in the series.\n\nThe case of the Central Park Five cut the city along racial lines from the outset, with the victim being a young white woman. It drew worldwide attention.\n\nIt took years for the five to be exonerated, and they spent most of their youth in prison. Another man later confessed to the attack.\n\nThe series has had real-life consequences for former \u201cCentral Park Five\u201d prosecutor Linda Fairstein. Fallout from the Netflix show has led to her being dropped by her book publisher, Dutton. Fairstein also resigned as a Board of Trustees member at Vassar College and from the victims-services agency, Safe Horizon.\n\n___\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The searing TV series on the plight of the Central Park Five created a memorable Emmy moment Sunday when the five exonerated men stood and were honored at the awards show.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Kennedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/2019_primetime_emmy_awards_-_arrivals_60334_c0-224-3185-2081_s1770x1032.jpg?01eb8a41c417b567510a41afb83d4a89dd9daf04", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
