So, there's a lot of sand that they can play with.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let them fight their own wars.\"\n\nThe split-screen foreign policy moment proved difficult to reconcile and came during perhaps the darkest moment for the modern U.S.-Turkey relationship and a time of trial for Trump and his Republican Party allies. Severe condemnation of Trump's failure to deter Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's assault on the Kurds, and his subsequent embrace of Turkish talking points about the former U.S. allies, sparked bipartisan outrage in the U.S. and calls for swift punishment for the NATO ally.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats in the House, bitterly divided over the Trump impeachment inquiry, banded together for an overwhelming 354-60 denunciation of the U.S. troop withdrawal. Many lawmakers expressed worry that the withdrawal may lead to revival of IS as well as Russian presence and influence in the area \u2014 in addition to the slaughter of many Kurds.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., publicly broke with Trump to call the U.S. relationship with the Kurds \"a great alliance.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry that we are where we are. I hope the vice president and the secretary of state can somehow repair the damage,\" McConnell said Wednesday.\n\nThe White House disclosed that Trump had both cajoled and threatened Erdogan in an unusual letter last week, urging him to act only in \"the right and humane way\" in Syria. The letter was sent the same day Erdogan launched the major offensive against the Kurds.\n\nTrump started on a positive note by suggesting they \"work out a good deal,\" but then talked about crippling economic sanctions and concluded that the world \"will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!\"\n\nTrump did place some sanctions Monday on Turkey for the offensive. But as his emissaries were departing to threaten even tougher actions in the days ahead, Trump appeared to undercut their negotiating stance. He said the U.S. has no business in the region \u2014 and not to worry about the Kurdish fighters.\n\n\"If Turkey goes onto Syria, that's between Turkey and Syria, it's not between Turkey and the United States,\" Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\nAs he seeks to push Erdogan to agree to a cease-fire, Pence will confront doubts about American credibility and his own, as an emissary of an inconsistent president.\n\n\"Given how erratic President Trump's decision-making process and style has been, it's just hard to imagine any country on the receiving end of another interlocutor really being confident that what Pence and Pompeo are delivering reflects Trump's thinking at the moment or what it will be in the future,\" said Jeffrey Prescott, the Obama administration's senior director for Iran, Iraq, Syria and the Gulf states on the National Security Council and a former deputy national security adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe withdrawal is the worst decision of Trump's presidency, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who meets often with the president and is one of his strongest and most important supporters in Congress.\n\n\"To those who think the Mideast doesn't matter to America, remember 9/11 \u2014 we had that same attitude on 9/10/2001,\" Graham said", "description": "A senior U.S. delegation faces the herculean task of pressuring Turkey to accept a cease-fire in Northern Syria, hours after President Donald Trump declared the U.S. has no stake in defending Kurdish fighters who died by the thousands as America's partners against Islamic State extremists.
