The app, simply called Recorder, also has the ability to transcribe your recordings. That alone is uncommon among voice recorder apps \u2014 let alone free ones \u2014 and Google pushes that even further, creating those transcriptions on-device and in real time, without sending data to the internet.\n\nFor whatever reason, Google hasn\u2019t made a voice recorder app before now. It\u2019s been an odd absence on Pixel phones. And while it could be remedied by downloading any number of apps from the Play Store, having a simple one built into a phone should very much be an expected feature.\n\nThe Recorder app really does seem to push beyond what most voice recorders can do, though. Apple\u2019s Voice Memos app, for instance, just records audio and stores it for playback. And while there are some excellent transcription apps out there \u2014 like Otter \u2014 they usually perform that transcription on a server, which requires uploading your recordings to a third party, then waiting for the transcription to process.\n\nThe new Recorder app uses speech recognition and AI to transcribe lectures, meetings, interviews and more\u2014and makes them easy for you to find later. (English only right now, with more languages to come.) #madebygoogle pic.twitter.com/fdKRItuS4b \u2014 Google (@Google) October 15, 2019\n\nGoogle is able to do it all on-device, thanks to a new model for processing language, which Google has shrunk down so that it can be stored and run entirely on a phone. The app will even be able to identify certain sounds, like applause or playing music. For now, the app is only available in English, but Google says more languages will come later. It\u2019ll also be limited to the Pixel 4.\n\nThe app looks impressive so far. Google showed a live demo onstage, where the app transcribed what the speaker was saying and seemed to pretty much nail the transcript.", "description": "The app, called Recorder, also has the ability to transcribe your recordings.
