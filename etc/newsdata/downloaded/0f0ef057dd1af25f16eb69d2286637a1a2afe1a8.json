(It's worth noting that Recoil pegs the average PDW length at around 10.3 inches.)\n\nDespite the allure of a nimble PDW conversion kit, the Army isn't necessarily on the lookout for one. In April, the Army awarded Swiss defense contractor Brugger & Thomet a $2.5 million contract to outfit the personal security details with the APC9K semi-automatic carbine.\n\nBut it's worth noting that at $399 apiece and a 43-round capacity, the MP17 presents a compelling alternative to the roughly $2,500-per-weapon price tag on the 30-round 9mm APC9K submachine gun. (Although, to be fair, the latter includes spare parts and accessories.)\n\nAnd even if the Army doesn't go for it, the other services might. As We Are The Mighty smartly points out, the MP17 could serve as a viable alternative to the collapsible 30-round GAU-5A Aircrew Self Defense Weapon that the Air Force recently adopted for pilot forced to eject in hostile territory, especially since the service r ecently tested the M17 as a potential sidearm for pilots.", "description": "The Army and other services have adopted the M17/M18 handgun as a sidearm.
