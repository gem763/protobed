We joined our two amazing families, had countless laughs, made wonderful friends and were blessed with incredible opportunities.\n\n\"Today we take our next step together, but on separate paths. We will always be grateful for the love we've shared and will always work together to raise our two beautiful dogs.\n\n(Image: Splash)\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\n\"We will be taking time to rediscover ourselves in this transition and we thank you for your patience and support in giving us the space to do so.\"\n\nThe 44 year-old told The Times back in 2014 that she didn't want to become a mum.\n\nShe said: \"There were a lot of people who came and thanked me for saying it out loud, and I thought, 'Well, isn't it sad, that we can't say it out loud?'\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"I really don't understand the hullaballoo around it. There's people who have kids and people who don't have kids. We're the people who don't have kids.\"\n\nGeoffrey had a similar stance on the question of kids. Christina previously gushed about her husband: \"We'll celebrate eight years of marriage in October. We've been together for almost 10.\n\n\"It doesn't feel that long at all. I just know him so well. I've never known anyone that well in my life...he understands me and listens to my c**p and still somehow loves me and I'm grateful for that.\"\n\nThe pair were first introduced by Christina's Mad Men co-star Vincent Kartheiser, and instantly hit it off.", "description": "Christina told fans that she and husband Geoffrey Arend have called it quits in an amicable and good natured message", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Splash", "Wireimage", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4689678.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_International-Emmy-Awards-2014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
