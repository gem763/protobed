'Everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong.'\n\nJackie Siegel revealed that her daughter Victoria, who died of a drug overdose at the age of 18 in 2015, hated shooting for their film Queen of Versailles\n\nJackie shared this photo celebrating her twin daughters' birthdays on October 20. Jackie, her husband and their eight children rose to fame during the firming of the movie Queen of Versailles, which followed their efforts to build a Versailles-inspired mansion in Florida\n\n'She was embarrassed by it, and she was also going through a kind of a bad period in her life, weight-wise,' David said on his daughter Victoria and her feelings about filming Queen of Versailles . 'Everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong'\n\nAt the age of 18 Victoria tragically died by overdosing on methadone and antidepressants on June 6, 2015. Jackie published her daughter's diary detailing her struggle with addiction in March, which was Victoria's last wish.\n\n'In her diary, she said the worst thing that had happened to her was the movie Queen of Versailles,' Jackie said.\n\nThe family rose to fame in the documentary where they chased the American dream and tried to build a modern Versailles palace in suburban Florida\n\n'When the camera people were around, David would try to lock up somewhere and hide. He had no interest in it or being with them, either. It was hard for them to catch any normal family interaction.'\n\nDavid went further to say the documentary wasn't completely accurate, in fact he says just 25 percent of it was true.\n\n'During that same time we were going through the recession, so between business pressure and these film people showing up unexpected. \u2026 I would throw them out, and Jackie would bring them back in. They would show up on holidays and birthdays and on Christmas. It was a bad period. Then they showed the company in a bad light. Only about 25 percent of the film was accurate,' he said.\n\nIn 2012 the film was finally released, but things only became more complicated for Victoria with the fame.\n\n'Once the movie came out, she was treated totally differently at school. People used her to buy the drugs or to get money from her, and since they knew now that she was rich, it was like, \"Oh, she\u2019s got the rich parents,\" even though she never cared about our money,' Jackie said.\n\nVictoria's battle with addiction saw her abuse Xanax then turn to harder opiates.\n\n'Let me tell you how she got on Xanax: She was a typical, mixed-up teenager, so we sent her to a psychiatrist for counseling and when she came home, she said, \u2018He put me on Xanax,' David said.\n\n'A few months later, she was mixed up and was not doing well in high school, so we sent her back, and she said, \"He doubled my dosage,\"' he added.\n\n'In her diary, she said the worst thing that had happened to her was the movie Queen of Versailles,' Jackie said\n\nJackie and her family, including Victoria, were featured on Celebrity Wife Swap (pictured) in 2015, just months before her daughter's death\n\nThe Siegel family pictured gathered at Victoria's gravestone this year\n\nVictoria overdosed on methadone and antidepressants on June 6, 2015 while home alone as her family attended a Utah wedding. She was fresh out of rehab at the time\n\n'I was so ignorant. I didn\u2019t know Xanax from Advil. I had no idea what it was or what it does. We had never even seen a marijuana cigarette in our lives, or had ever used a drug, and here she is, struggling with that Queen of Versailles movie. It was a perfect storm.'\n\nThe day of Victoria's death, her family said she received 'cruel' texts from the ex-girlfriend of her then-boyfriend, who supposedly encouraged her to try out hard opiates.\n\nThey also published Victoria's diary to raise awareness about youth drug addiction\n\nWhile the family continues to mourn the loss of their daughter, they have dedicated the rest of their lives to raising awareness on the opioid epidemic.\n\nThe Seigels not only published Victoria's diary to raise awareness about drug addiction, but they've also created the Victoria Siegel Foundation in her name that helps address teenage drug abuse and will throw their annual 'An Evening to Save Lives' benefit gala this Friday.\n\nThe couple also are active advocates for legislation that would require people to lock up their prescription medications and are pushing for a law that would require doctors to prescribe the life-saving medication naloxone for patients given prescriptions for pain-relief drugs.\n\n'When she overdosed, she was still alive. By the time she got to the hospital, she had died. I am a big advocate that if a family has a child who might be using drugs, they should have Narcan in their homes,' David said.\n\nHe shared a statistic that 200 people die each day from drug overdoses, adding 'It\u2019s like a jetliner with 200 passengers crashing, every day.'\n\nThe unfinished Versailles mansion in Windemere, Florida pictured above. The opulent future 90,000-square-foot mansion started construction in 2004 and will feature a roller rink and discotheque, nine kitchens, 30 bathrooms and 14 bedrooms\n\nAside from their charity work, the couple is also developing a movie about their daughter called Victoria\u2019s Voice that will serve as a warning to other young people about the dangers of opioids.\n\n'My only direction to them was that I wanted it to be like Schindler\u2019s List, and when the movie is over, I don\u2019t want people clapping. I want them to really get the message and solemnly walk out. They are going to show Victoria as a sweet, wonderful, beautiful 18-year-old girl who dies when she shouldn\u2019t have,' David said on the film.\n\n'I just wish that she would have been open with us instead of keeping it all in her diary. I wish she would have leaned on my shoulder and opened her heart with all her internal struggles,' Jackie reflected on her daughter.", "description": "Jackie Siegel revealed that her daughter Victoria, who died of a drug overdose at the age of 18 in 2015, hated shooting for their film Queen of Versailles.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/07/20021992-0-image-a-25_1571724730906.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
