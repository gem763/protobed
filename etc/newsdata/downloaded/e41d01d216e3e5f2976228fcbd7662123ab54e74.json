He was arrested for having pills in two envelopes. At 29, he was given probation on fraud charges.\n\nBy the time he was 41 he was charged as a drug kingpin, according to court documents and a New Jersey report that detailed black organized crime in the state. In 1990, a federal judge sentenced Pray to life in prison without parole, plus three 25-year stints for, among other things, cocaine and marijuana possession and distribution. More of his story.\n\nNation's failed weed war turned many into prisoners and others into moguls\n\nIt was 2012, and Ferrell Scott was watching television inside Pennsylvania's Allenwood federal penitentiary when he learned that the sale of marijuana, something he was given a life sentence for just four years earlier, was becoming legal in two states.\n\nColorado had approved its recreational use, the inmate learned from the broadcast, and so had Washington.\n\nScott had been struggling with depression since he was incarcerated in March 2008. But he felt a bit of hope as he watched the framework that had put people like him away without parole begin to crumble. More of his story.\n\nFerrell Scott has been incarcerated for pot distribution since 2008.
