These changes will ensure that no Virginian will be forced to label themselves to get married.\"\n\nHe said the guidance followed the principle \"that statutes should be construed to avoid any conflict with the constitution\".\n\nHe added: \"I appreciate the courage these couples showed in raising this issue, and I wish them all the best in their lives together.\"\n\nThe three couples in the lawsuit are Brandyn Churchill and Sophie Rogers; Ashley Ramkishun and Samuel Sarfo; and Amelia Spencer and Kendall Poole.\n\nLawyer Victor M Glasberg filed the lawsuit on their behalf and said it should continue until the law was ruled unconstitutional.\n\nImage copyright Brandyn Churchill/Sophie Rogers Image caption Brandyn Churchill and Sophie Rogers were one of three couples to file the lawsuit\n\nHe told the Washington Post the new guidance was \"welcome, it's much appreciated, and it's the right thing to do as an initial response. But the statute is obnoxious and... we need to get rid of the statute\".\n\nMs Ramkishun told the paper: \"It doesn't resolve the fact that there's still a law in place in Virginia. The state could change its mind at any point in regards to whether the race question is optional or not.\"\n\nMr Churchill told the BBC that when he and Ms Rogers applied for a licence in Rockbridge County they found that \"many of the categories were outdated, offensive racist terms which have no place in the 21st Century. We said we were uncomfortable and left\".\n\nImage copyright Victor M Glasberg Image caption Lawyer Victor M Glasberg has been pondering a challenge for many years\n\nMr Glasberg told the BBC he had been mulling a challenge for many years. When he got married in 1981, he asked if he could put \"human\" down in the category but was told no.\n\nVirginia is one of eight states in the US with the legal requirement to identify race prior to marriage.", "description": "The US state's attorney-general says couples no longer have to declare their race to get married.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/154D4/production/_108725278_ashley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
