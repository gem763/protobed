I will do so of course having taken advice in appropriate quarters,\"\n\n\"The government is not the arbiter of what is orderly.\"\n\nMr Bercow invited Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg to come to the despatch box saying at the moment there \"is extreme ambiguity about intention\" adding that \"cannot be right\".\n\nMr Rees-Mogg said: \"I think you worry unduly, that there will be a full emergency business statement on Monday, which is part of what I was saying so that people will have a full appreciation of what business there will be.\"\n\nHe added: \"The Queen's Speech debate will continue but Monday will be as I set out on the point of order I raised a few moments ago.\"", "description": "Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom told journalists she had also received abuse when walking through the crowd.", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Pa", "Vickie Flores Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20655414.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
