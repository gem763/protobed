But we've gotta get ready to play against a talented Senegal team that played Australia tough today, and then we go from there and see what awaits us from there.\"\n\nUndermanned\n\nKyle Wiltjer had 24 points, while Cory Joseph had 15, but the seventh-ranked Lithuanians, who'd routed Senegal by 54 points two nights earlier, were too much for the undermanned Canadians, who are missing all but two of their NBA players in Joseph and Khem Birch. The latter player had 12 points on the night.\n\nI don't know. Just play. They're all important. \u2014 Canada's Cory Joseph on how team moves on after pair of losses at FIBA World Cup\n\nFormer longtime Toronto Raptors forward Jonas Valanciunas led Lithuania with 13 points, while Edgaras Ulanovas also had 13.\n\nThe game was a must-win for the Canadians, after they lost their opening Group H game 108-92 to Australia on Sunday.\n\nCanada caps the preliminary round Thursday against Senegal, which is also 0-2, before travelling to Shanghai for two important classification games. On the line are 16 berths for one of the four second-chance Olympic qualifying tournaments next June. The four winners of those tournaments punch their tickets to Tokyo.\n\nHow does Canada regroup after two losses?\n\n\"I don't know,\" said a fuming Joseph. \"Just play. They're all important.\"\n\n'We didn't do enough to win'\n\nJoseph's anger was mostly aimed at the referees, who, much like Sunday's game, were quick with the whistles in the early going. Nurse was a picture of frustration, pacing the sideline, pleading with officials, and shaking his head in disbelief.\n\n\"If you could tell me where the foul is, let me know. I watched them. I don't know. I don't know what to tell you,\" Joseph said. \"That tall dude \u2026 now I'm not one to blame anybody and I never blame no-one. It's on us at the end of the day. But that tall dude was horrible. I don't care. I'm done with it. I don't care.\n\n\"At the end of the day we lost the game. We didn't do enough to win.\"\n\nCanada's World Cup story could have been far different. This summer promised to be a coming-out party for the country's national program, the year that finally saw a team stocked with NBA players. Canada Basketball listed 17 NBA players on its camp invitation list, but ended up with just Birch and Joseph. Kelly Olynyk was injured in exhibition action.\n\nEveryone else? They passed on national team duty, leaving a team comprised of mostly European-based players \u2014 including five Canadian university products \u2014 the mammoth task of trying to qualify for Tokyo. Even if Canada does clinch a second-chance qualifying spot, who'll show up to play?\n\n\"Obviously not the outcome our team wanted, so we have to learn from it, this isn't the end of the tournament,\" Wiltjer said. \"So we've just got to continue to be positive as a program and just continue to work.\"\n\nOvermatched\n\nThe Canadians are making their first World Cup appearance since the 2010 tournament in Turkey, where they went 0-5 and finished 22nd out of 24 teams. Canada's last World Cup win came 17 years ago when they beat Venezuela to finish 13th in Indianapolis.\n\n\"At the beginning you always expect to win, but now we have to take the mindset that we are kind of moving on and we got a couple more games to win and finish the best we can,\" said Canada guard Phil Scrubb. \"[The loss] will be tough for today but tomorrow is another day and we will forget about it and move on.\"\n\nLithuania also has just two NBAers in Valanciunas and Domantas Sabonis, but the players' level of commitment to their national program is unmatched. Valanciunas, who called basketball Lithuania's \"second religion,\" is playing his 13th straight summer with the national team.\n\nThe overmatched Canadians certainly couldn't be faulted for their effort at Dongguan Basketball Center. They were scrappy on the defensive end, but had trouble generating offence against a significantly bigger Lithuanian side that outrebounded Canada 46-27.\n\nPart of the Canadians' game plan was to utilize their long-range shooters, but they hit just five of 14 shots from deep.\n\n\"We were coming in hoping to get up a lot of threes tonight, and kind of shoot over the top of them, but I give [the Lithuanians] credit, they were playing hard and hustling out to our shooters and about the only one they couldn't keep track of was this guy,\" Nurse said with a nod to Wiltjer, who was 3-for-3 from the three-point line.\n\nMomentum fizzled\n\nCanada never led and trailed 24-14 to end the first quarter. Foul trouble sent Kevin Pangos to the bench just four minutes into the game, and Birch followed him a couple of minutes later with a pair of fouls.\n\nThe Lithuanians compiled a 16-point lead early in the second quarter, but Canada fought back to cut the deficit to nine points. Lithuania took a 46-36 lead into the halftime break.\n\nLithuania went ahead by 15 midway through a third quarter that saw Melvin Ejim on the bench in foul trouble, but Canada clawed back and a beautiful pass from Pangos to Brady Heslip for a three-pointer cut the difference to nine points. All momentum fizzled at that point though, and the Canadians trailed by 16 to start the fourth.\n\nLithuania dominated a disappointing fourth quarter for Canada.\n\nThe game drew several hundred green-clad Lithuanian fans, who sang, banged drums, and unfurled a massive Lithuanian flag.\n\nAustralia also advanced from Group H after an 81-68 victory over Senegal in Tuesday's early game.", "description": "Drawn into arguably the World Cup's toughest group, the Canadian men's basketball team clutched slim hopes of an improbable upset in China.
