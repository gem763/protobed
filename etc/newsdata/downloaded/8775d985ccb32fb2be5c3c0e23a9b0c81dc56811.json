Our policy remains that we should not delay, that we should leave the EU on October 31 and that is what I will say to the EU and I will report back to the House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018One way or another we will leave the EU with this deal, to which this House has just given its assent. I thank members across the House for that hard-won agreement.\u2019\n\nHe did not mention a general election in his address, despite threatening to call one before Christmas earlier today.\n\nThe 110-page Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which also contains an additional 125 pages of additional notes, was read in the Commons for the first time last night.\n\nLabour had already stated before this evening that the programme motion did not allow enough time for \u2018sufficient scrutiny\u2019 of the deal\u2019s legal text.\n\nJeremy Corbyn told the Commons that Boris had been the \u2018author of his own misfortune\u2019 (Picture: PA)\n\nIt was defeated by a majority of 18 (Picture: Parliamentlive.tv)\n\nTheir sentiments were then quickly followed by the DUP, who also said they could not back the intensive timetable.\n\nTonight Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Commons that Boris had been the \u2018author of his own misfortune\u2019.\n\nMaking the Prime Minister an offer, he continued: \u2018Work with us, all of us to agree a reasonable timetable, and I suspect this House will vote to debate, scrutinise and, I hope, commend the detail of this bill.\n\n\u2018That would be the sensible way forward, and that is the offer I make on behalf of the opposition tonight.\u2019\n\nFather of the House Ken Clarke told the Prime Minister he didn\u2019t see the logic in pausing the bill and asked him to reconsider.\n\nHowever, he recommended that the government come back with just a modest adjustment to the timetable proposed, as \u2018three to four days would certainly do it\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
