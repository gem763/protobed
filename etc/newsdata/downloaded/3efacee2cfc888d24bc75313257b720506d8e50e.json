But we will WIN!'\n\nPresident Donald Trump stepped into a racial minefield on Tuesday, calling Democrats' move to impeach him a 'lynching'\n\nIt's highly unusual for white politicians to invoke lynchings; the mob-murder phenomenon took the lives of 3,446 African-Americans in the U.S. between 1882 and 1968\n\nIllinois Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush erupted on Twitter, telling Trump that 'people who look like you' had lynched 'people who look like me'\n\n'What the hell is wrong with you?' Rep. Rush asked Trump: 'What the hell is wrong with you?'\n\nIllinois Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush, who is black, erupted.\n\n'You think this impeachment is a LYNCHING?' he tweeted. 'What the hell is wrong with you? Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet.'\n\nSeparetly, Rush tweeted that Trump's choice of words was '[e]xample No. 5286 as to why this President is unfit for office.'\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the House majority whip, was more measured on CNN. He said 'lynching' is 'one word no president ought to apply to himself.'\n\n'I'm not just a politician up here, I'm a southern politician. I'm a product of the South,' Clyburn said.'\n\n'I know the history of that word. That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using.'\n\nA crowd watched, in an undated photo found in the Library of Congress, as Caucasian men prepared a platform for the hanging of an African-American man named Henry Smith, who was accused of killing a white girl named Myrtle Vance; painted lettering on the platform spelled out 'Justice,' and the lynching drew a crowd of 10,000 people in Paris, Texas\n\nA search of White House records and interview transcripts indicates that the president hasn't used that word publicly while in office before. He has repeatedly called attacks on him from inside his own administration a 'coup.'\n\nThe Tuskegee Institute says 3,446 African Americans were lynched \u2013 hanged by angry mobs, and sometimes burned \u2013 between 1882 and 1968 in the United States. The total number is likely far higher.\n\nPhotos of lynchings were often passed around as souvenirs in the Deep South during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, showing burned and dismembered bodies of black men.\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, a member of House leadership, warned Trump that 'lynching' is a word no president should use to describe a lawful political predicament\n\nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas called attacks on him during his 1991 Senate confirmation hearings 'a high-tech lynching,' words that stung coming from a black nominee\n\nCongress made extrajudicial lynching murders a federal hate crime in 2018, equating them with other forms of racial terrorism.\n\nDemocratic Senators Kamala Harris of California,and Cory Booker of New Jersey introduced the bill along with South Carolina Republican Senator Tim Scott.\n\nThe word 'lynching' is rarely invoked by white politicians. Its most famous recent usage in American politics came a quarter-century ago during confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nFacing uncorroborated allegations of sexual harassment from a former workplace subordinate, Thomas called Democrats' hearings \u2013 led by then-senator Joe Biden \u2013 'a national disgrace.'\n\n'From my standpoint, as a black American, as far as I'm concerned it is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas,' he said.\n\n'And it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the U.S. Senate rather than hung from a tree.'", "description": "One Democratic congressman erputed: 'You think this impeachment is a LYNCHING?
