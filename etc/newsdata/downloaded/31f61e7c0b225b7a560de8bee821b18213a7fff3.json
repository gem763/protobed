Someone interested in seeing the data or private images could even use free software programs or a standard web browser to view it.\n\nThe news outlet found 187 servers -- computers used to store and retrieve medical data -- in the U.S. that were unprotected by basic security measures. These systems were being used in doctors' offices, medical imaging centers and mobile X-ray services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even hacking. It\u2019s walking into an open door,\u201d Jackie Singh, a cybersecurity researcher and chief executive of the consulting firm Spyglass Security, told ProPublica.\n\nAccording to the report, some of the medical providers started to lock down their systems after the media organization contacted them.\n\nTAMPA BAY CONTAINS 4 BILLION BITS OF MICROPLASTIC, SHOCKING STUDY INDICATES\n\nThe server of U.S. company MobilexUSA displayed the names of over a million patients, all by typing in a simple data query, ProPublica reported.

Medical knowledge can be used against you in malicious ways: to shame people, to blackmail people,\u201d Cooper Quintin, a security researcher and senior staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights group, told ProPublica.\n\nTINY 'BIOHYBRID' ROBOTS DIRECTED BY MUSCLES AND NERVES BUILT BY RESEARCHERS\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThere's been an increasing number of data breaches in recent years. In 2015, U.S. health insurer Anthem revealed that the private data of 78 million people had been exposed in a hack.\n\n\u201cWhat we typically see in the health care industry is that there is Band-Aid upon Band-Aid applied\u201d to legacy computer systems, Singh said. \u201cIt\u2019s 2019.
