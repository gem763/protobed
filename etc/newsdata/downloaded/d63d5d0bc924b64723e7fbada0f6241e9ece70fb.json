That field in Huambo is now a busy street. The southern African nation is now years past a grinding civil war and hopes to be land mine-free by 2025, a goal of scores of countries around the world.\n\n\u201cLand mines are an unhealed scar of war,\u201d Harry said in the town of Dirico. \u201cBy clearing the land mines we can help this community find peace, and with peace comes opportunity.\u201d He said retracing his mother\u2019s path was \u201cquite emotional.\u201d\n\nDiana\u2019s visit is still very much discussed today in Huambo after people were struck by her warmth and willingness to acknowledge their country\u2019s devastating 27-year conflict, the Angola country director for mine-clearing organization The HALO Trust said.\n\n\u201cThe main impact of Diana\u2019s walk in 1997 was the level of global exposure it provided for land mines not only in Angola but the world,\u201d Ralph Legg said. She was a great advocate for a land mine ban, and \u201cher willingness to visit an actual mine field, to place herself right in that context, provided great impetus and gave it a great boost.\u201d\n\nThe international ban on anti-personnel mines was signed that year and entered into force two years later. So far 164 countries have signed on. \u201cMore than 48 million stockpiled mines have been destroyed and 31 countries have been completely cleared of land mines,\u201d The HALO Trust said, while production of the weapons has almost dried up.\n\nHarry on his visit also remotely detonated a decades-old mine, met with mine-clearing teams and was visiting the orthopedic hospital his mother visited for her meetings with mine victims.\n\n\u201cI think that will be a very poignant moment of coming full circle,\u201d Legg said. \u201cVery striking once people compare those images from the two visits to see how far Angola has come.\u201d\n\nThe world, however, is hardly free of mines, and the prince said Angola itself still has more than 1,000 mine fields left to clear, 22 years after his mother\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cI wonder if she was still alive whether that would still be the case,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure she would have seen it through.\u201d\n\nOther countries that remain heavily mined include Afghanistan, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen, and Afghanistan led the world with at least 2,300 casualties in 2017, according to the Landmine Monitor 2018 report.\n\n\u201cMyanmar was the only known instance of government forces actively planting the weapons\u201d in the year-long period between October 2017 and 2018, the report said.\n\n\u201cA staggering 60 million people around the world still live in fear and risk of land mines. We cannot turn our backs on them and leave a job half done,\u201d Harry said.\n\nAngola, which has committed a new $60 million for mine clearance, now hopes to turn some of its mine-free areas into sites for wildlife conservation and ecotourism. The prince was unveiling a project meant to protect wildlife corridors near the sprawling Okavango Delta, a rare inland delta in neighboring Botswana that doesn\u2019t flow into a sea or ocean and is home to several endangered species.\n\nHarry called on for international effort to help clear mines from the Okavango watershed in Angola. \u201cEveryone who recognizes the priceless importance of safeguarding Africa\u2019s most intact natural landscape should commit fully to this mission,\u201d he said.\n\nHis first official family tour with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and their baby, Archie, will continue with stops in Malawi and further events in South Africa with a focus on issues including mental health and women\u2019s empowerment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A body armor-wearing Prince Harry on Friday followed in the footsteps of his late mother, Princess Diana, whose walk through an active mine field in Angola years ago helped to lead to a global ban on the deadly weapons.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Cara Anna"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/angola_royals_visit_75379_c0-802-2000-1968_s1770x1032.jpg?659824d7bc1702555dbe15c8b2006c334e30e848", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
