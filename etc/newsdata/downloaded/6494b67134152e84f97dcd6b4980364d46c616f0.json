Word of the project\u2019s troubles comes as the Media Lab\u2019s attempts to cover up its extensive financial ties to late financier and alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein have seriously damaged its credibility and led to resignation of its director, Joichi Ito.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, the project \u2014 a plastic hydroponic grow box filled with \u201cadvanced sensors and LED lights\u201d that would supposedly make it possible to replicate crop conditions from any part of the global \u2014 was a sham, with MIT\u2019s Open Agriculture Initiative director Caleb Harper resorting to faking demos:\n\nAhead of big demonstrations of the devices with MIT Media Lab funders, staff were told to place plants grown elsewhere into the devices, the employees told Business Insider. In another instance, one employee was asked to purchase herbs at a nearby flower market, dust off the dirt in which they were grown, and place them in the boxes for a photoshoot, she said... The aim was to make it look like the devices lived up to Harper\u2019s claims, the employees said. Those claims, which included assertions that the devices could grow foods like broccoli four times faster than traditional methods, landed Harper and his team articles in outlets ranging from the Wall Street Journal to Wired and National Geographic.\n\nAll told, Business Insider\u2019s sources said, the \u201cpersonal food computers\u201d amounted to hydroponic boxes that don\u2019t work.\n\nDietitian and former Open Agriculture Initiative project manager Paula Cerqueira told the site that the devices she worked on were \u201cglorified grow boxes... with some sensors for collecting data,\u201d and that on multiple occasions staff filled them with store-bought plants that had to be washed of dirt before presentations with funders. The boxes also weren\u2019t air-tight, Cerqueira added, meaning that users couldn\u2019t control for things like carbon dioxide levels or temperature and humidity.\n\nCerqueira told Business Insider that out of dozens of units sent to schools in the Boston region, only a handful ever worked. On one occasion, the Media Lab sent 30 of them to schools, and \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that of the 30-ish food computers we sent out, at most two grew a plant,\u201d Cerqueira told the site. On another, the Media Lab couldn\u2019t make the boxes work in time for a demo with a representative from the Bezos Family Foundation, something Cerqueira told Business Insider was \u201csuper embarrassing.\u201d\n\nIn other words, this sounds a hell of a lot like Theranos, the disastrously failed startup that also promised a magical technology box (though in their case, it was fake blood-testing technology that helped the company achieve a valuation of $US9 ($13) billion.)\n\nThe food computer certainly doesn\u2019t come anywhere the scale of Theranos, but Harper touted it with similarly grandiose claims: In a March 2019 video by Seeker, Harper stated that \u201cYou think Star Trek or Willy Wonka, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going for.\u201d\n\nAccording to Business Insider, Harper directed an email requesting comment to an MIT spokesperson, who \u201cdidn\u2019t provide a comment.\u201d\n\n[Business Insider]", "description": "The prestigious multidisciplinary MIT Media Lab built a \u201cpersonal food computer\u201d that worked so poorly that demos had to be faked Theranos-style, per a weekend report in Business Insider.
