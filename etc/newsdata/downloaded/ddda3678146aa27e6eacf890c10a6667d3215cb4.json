These events provide the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) opportunities to laud past achievements, legitimize the course it has set for the country, and rally support for challenges yet to come. And as Chinese President Xi Jinping surveys the country\u2019s progress, he can point to any number of extraordinary economic, social, and geopolitical achievements.\n\nOutside observers tend to credit the Deng-era reforms for China\u2019s meteoric rise. But Xi and the rest of the Chinese leadership are more focused on the earliest years of the PRC\u2014when Mao Zedong sat at the helm of the Communist Party. Like Mao, Xi has prioritized strengthening the party, inculcating collective socialist values, and rooting out nonbelievers.

And like Mao, Xi has encouraged the creation of a cult of personality around himself.\n\nYet Xi has revived the methods and symbols of Maoism not in service of a return to the past but in order to advance his own transformative agenda, one that seeks to ensure that all political, social, and economic activity within, and increasingly outside of, China serves the interests of the CCP. He is creating a model that reasserts the power of the Communist Party; progressively erases the distinction between public and private in both the political and economic spheres; and seeks to integrate foreign actors, including private businesses, more deeply into a system of CCP values and institutions.
