Noah Baumbach\u2019s Marriage Story\u2014the centerpiece selection of this year\u2019s New York Film Festival, set to premiere in theaters on Nov. 6 and on Netflix on Dec. 6\u2014understands this on a profound level, charting the disintegration of a couple with an incisiveness, and mordant sense of humor, that\u2019s wrenching in its authenticity. Led by two of the year\u2019s finest performances courtesy of Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson as an artistic pair brought to figurative blows, it\u2019s a superlative drama about the trauma of separation, and the scars it leaves.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never been through a divorce, it\u2019ll scare the hell out of you. And if you have, it\u2019ll break your heart.\n\nA companion piece of sorts to 2005\u2019s The Squid and the Whale (which was partly based on the disintegration of his parents\u2019 marriage, and told from an adolescent perspective), and undoubtedly influenced by his own split from first wife Jennifer Jason Leigh, Marriage Story is Baumbach\u2019s most assured work to date. That\u2019s evident from the outset, in which we\u2019re presented with respective montages of Nicole (Johansson) and Charlie (Driver)\u2014she detailing his best qualities via narration, and vice versa\u2014going about their day-to-day duties as spouses, artists (he\u2019s a director of plays, and she\u2019s his star actress) and parents to 8-year-old son Henry (Azhy Robertson). Upon concluding, it\u2019s revealed that their comments have been penned for use in a mediation session as a way to start their separation proceedings on a positive, remembering-the-good note.\n\nIt\u2019s a conventionally nice thought that inevitably fails, as Nicole proves uninterested in reading aloud the nicey-nice things she thinks about her soon-to-be ex. Although they\u2019re still living together in their Brooklyn apartment, a post-show cast party finds the two situated at different tables, and leaving abruptly to ride the subway home in silence, with Baumbach positioning them at opposite ends of the car, divided in the frame by a center-aisle pole, with Charlie standing and Nicole sitting. It\u2019s far from the last image of disconnection and alienation\u2014later shots of Charlie stranded amidst a crowd of Times Square pedestrians as he receives a horrific phone call, and wandering amongst a sea of California rental cars, similarly suggest the duo\u2019s forlorn isolation.\n\nAt the same time, Baumbach keeps his camera close to his leads\u2019 faces, capturing their suffering and sorrow in exacting detail. Having nabbed an audition for a TV pilot, Nicole travels with Henry to her native Los Angeles, where she stays with her intrusive mom (Julie Hagerty) and flustered sister (Merritt Wever). Though initially interested in handling the divorce amicably, she visits attorney Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern), whose oh-so-understanding attitude\u2014augmented by her wonderful tea and cookies\u2014is tactical through and through. It\u2019s also successful, inducing Nicole to open up about the displacement and loss-of-identity and agency issues that, more than Charlie\u2019s infidelity, drove her to embark on her present course. In a prolonged take that\u2019s as aesthetically subtle as it is emotionally revealing, a magnificent Johansson guides us through Nicole\u2019s winding interior journey of recollection, analysis and self-assertion\u2014a development that\u2019s as eye-opening to us as it seems to be for her.\n\nDivorce papers are subsequently filed, and served to a blindsided Charlie during his visit to L.A. In turn, he sees cutthroat shark Jay (Ray Liotta), who terrifies him with talk of a forthcoming cataclysmic conflict. He opts instead to go with welcoming lawyer Bert Spitz (Alan Alda), whose I\u2019m-your-friend shtick and promises of avoiding court soon ring hollow. Escalation follows escalation. Nicole attempts to establish herself and Henry as California residents. Charlie fights that effort, arguing that they were always a New York clan. Catch-22s materialize, with Charlie realizing that getting a place in L.A. helps Nicole\u2019s contention that they\u2019re a West Coast-based family, while staying in New York aids her chances of securing sole custody. Panic gives way to frustration gives way to tears gives way to ire, all of it coming to a head during a quarrel between Charlie and Nicole that deteriorates into wall-punching, finger-pointing confessions of their deepest, darkest, ugliest resentments.\n\nThat Marriage Story manages to be funny at routine intervals is a near miracle, given that its every moment feels ripped from raw, miserable reality, whether it\u2019s Charlie and Henry spending an afternoon being observed by a weirdo \u201cevaluator,\u201d or Jay and Nora nastily bickering in a courtroom populated by waiting-their-turn couples and in front of an indifferent judge. In these spaces, judgment is everywhere, thus compelling everyone to engage in keeping-up-appearances performances. It\u2019s enough to trigger any divorc\u00e9e\u2019s PTSD, and that goes double for Jay\u2019s introductory doom-and-gloom-and-strategy meeting, which is so true to life that, in a few minutes\u2019 time, Liotta almost steals the entire film (by which I mean, incites seismic heart palpitations).\n\n\u201c If you\u2019ve never been through a divorce, it\u2019ll scare the hell out of you. And if you have, it\u2019ll break your heart. \u201d\n\nBaumbach\u2019s screenplay is scalpel-sharp. His dialogue is rife with exchanges that seem trivial on the surface but are loaded with spiteful meaning, and his staging is awash in sideways glances and minor gestures that are coiled with fury. Nonetheless, it\u2019s his performers\u2014always front and center in one painfully intimate composition after another\u2014who carry Marriage Story\u2019s contentious load. His face fluctuating between downtrodden desperation and lashing-out rage, Driver evokes Charlie\u2019s agony with nuance and intensity, peaking with his showstopping rendition of \u201cBeing Alive\u201d from Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Company. Likewise gifted with a Company number (\u201cYou Could Drive a Person Crazy\u201d) that speaks to her condition and trajectory, Johansson is more than Driver\u2019s equal, conveying Nicole\u2019s increasingly hardened resolve without sacrificing the grief and confusion underscoring her state of mind\u2014culminating with a climactic reaction shot in a bathroom doorway, full of anger, bitterness, appreciation and hope, that\u2019s as good as any big-screen acting this year. Together, they deftly express how divorce amplifies the worst of us and blights out the best, leading only to vitriol, sadness and ruin.\n\nTo a degree even greater than its spiritual forefathers Kramer vs. Kramer and Shoot the Moon, Marriage Story considers the positions of its dueling protagonists with an even-handed empathy that also, ultimately, extends to Henry, an unsteady boy caught (at one point, literally) in the middle of a tug-of-war that can have no clear-cut winner. And in its penultimate scene, it achieves a measure of poignant, tragic grace, via both its portrait of divorce as the last act of a long-running story which began with ecstatic promise\u2014as well as its recognition that, even after the papers are signed and the ordeal is over, the memories of those happier times linger on.", "description": "Director Noah Baumbach\u2019s devastating portrait of divorce features two of the year\u2019s finest performances courtesy of Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson.", "authors": ["Nick Schager"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570230863/191004-schager-marriage-story-tease_lihkyl", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
