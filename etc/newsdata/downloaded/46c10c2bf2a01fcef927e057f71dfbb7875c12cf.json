The candidate is a political heavyweight, who has served as Italy\u2019s prime minister and foreign minister.\n\nPaolo Gentiloni, a polished Italian aristocrat with some of the European Commission's strongest political credentials, on Tuesday received the official nomination as economy commissioner.\n\nAt first glance, it would seem to be a big win for Italy in a German-led Commission, when Rome has long been viewed as an enfant terrible of budgetary discipline. But much will depend on how far his powers range and to what extent he has to share his authority with Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis.\n\nIn her mission letter to Gentiloni, European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen said that the former Italian premier would oversee the EU's all-important Stability and Growth Pact, which is supposed to ensure fiscal discipline among eurozone countries. She did, however, note that he could use \"the full flexibility allowed in the rules.\"\n\nGentiloni will also be responsible for drawing up a carbon tax at Europe's borders, bringing down EU public debt levels, launching an EU investment scheme and simplifying tax regimes.\n\nCenter-right conservatives expressed immediate doubt about his fiscal prudence. Markus Ferber, spokesman for the European People's Party group in the Parliament's ECON Committee, complained: \"During his term as prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni has not managed to get the Italian economy out of the doldrums. This kind of track record does not instill a lot of confidence that he will do better as commissioner for the economy.\"\n\n1. What are Gentiloni's credentials?\n\nGentiloni's strengths are more political rather than economic: A member of the center-left Democratic Party, he's previously served as a foreign minister and prime minister of Italy. Intriguingly, he was a far-left activist in his 20s, and started out his career as an environmental journalist in the 1980s.\n\nSeeing Gentiloni as a safe pair of hands, Italy's President Sergio Mattarella called upon him to form a government at the end of 2016 when Matteo Renzi resigned from the premiership after failing to enact senatorial reforms in a constitutional referendum. One year later, Gentiloni was the country's most popular politician, well above far-right League leader Matteo Salvini or populist 5Stars leader Luigi Di Maio.\n\nHowever, while he has always maintained a courteous relationship with Brussels and his finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, engaged in constructive budget negotiations with the Commission, his government ultimately failed to significantly reduce Italy's enormous public debt. Brussels has threatened budget sanctions against Italy and pointed to the country's failure to reduce its debt in 2016 and 2017, prompting the right-wing media to blame Renzi and Gentiloni who were in office during those years.\n\nFurthermore, during his premiership, Italy signed a controversial financial agreement with the Libyan coast guard to reduce the number of migrants coming into Italy. Support to Fayez Al-Sarraj's government came at a political cost (critics accused the government of shifting the center-left government to the right) but his government was ultimately the first one to curb the number of people reaching European shores.\n\nGentiloni, who will turn 65 soon after his adventure in Brussels begins, received a traditional classical education and speaks fluent English and French, as well as some German. Known for his diplomatic skills, opponents call him \u201cer moviola\u201d \u2014 slow-mover in Roman dialect. He is particularly cautious in reading up in advance and reads all of his briefing papers, according to someone familiar with his working methods. The person mentioned that Gentiloni cautiously circles all the issues that he will be able to talk about, and separately puts a cross by those that he won't.\n\n2. What should we expect from his mandate?\n\nPresident Mattarella, who usually maintains a very low profile, said earlier this week that Italy will have a pivotal role in changing EU budget and fiscal rules.\n\nPrime Minister Giuseppe Conte then told the Italian parliament on Monday that the biggest goal for Italy\u2019s new government is to change the rules ensuring that countries in the European Union pursue sound public finances and coordinate their fiscal policies. \"The EU needs to improve its policies and [it] needs better economic and fiscal governance [that will not hinder growth],\" Conte said.\n\nThis approach from Conte is hardly a surprise as Italians have never been very good at complying with EU fiscal rules, and accumulated debt levels and deficit well beyond what the Commission authorizes.\n\nIf his government pushes for looser EU fiscal rules and a less austere approach to crisis management, Gentiloni could find himself caught between masters in Rome and Brussels. But Mattarella's words and the surprise decision to hand Gentiloni such an important portfolio might also be von der Leyen's way of ensuring Italy acts responsibly and abandons its Euroskeptic tendencies.\n\n\"It's the perfect trap,\" said one Democratic Party lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nWhile he was Italy\u2019s prime minister, with Padoan as a finance minister, Gentiloni tried hard to conform with EU rules. He is also one of the most vehement opponents of his Democratic Party\u2019s new governing alliance with the populist 5Stars.\n\n3. What opposition could he face in the parliamentary hearing?\n\nGentiloni\u2019s nomination is expected to go smoothly but he will probably have to face some uncomfortable questions about Italy's public finances.\n\nThe incoming commissioner will at some stage have to navigate the minefield of Italy's debt pile, its weak banking system and Alitalia's complicated restructuring plan (which involves input from the government).\n\nThe EPP's Ferber stressed there are tough questions to answer.\n\n\"During the Juncker Commission, the Stability and Growth Pact has lost a lot of credibility. The fact that now an Italian is put in charge of fiscal surveillance of Italy\u2019s budgetary mess, is less than ideal. Paolo Gentiloni has to prove that he means business when it comes to the fiscal rules.\u201d\n\nSome also point out that he isn't as serene as he seems. Philosopher Massimo Cacciari, the former mayor of Venice, once said in an interview that Gentiloni is known among friends for smashing rackets during tennis matches if he gets upset. \"He used to tell me: You have to be a man, you've got to hate your enemies,\" according to Cacciari.\n\nGentiloni had coronary surgery in early 2017 but his health is not seen as a concern.", "description": "The candidate is a political heavyweight, who has served as Italy\u2019s prime minister and foreign minister.", "authors": ["Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli", "Thibault Larger", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Jakob Hanke"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GettyImages-840248940-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
