She is the first Indian to win a gold medal at the championship, and has secured a place in the upper echelons of the sport with her straight-set victory over Japan\u2019s Nozomi Okuhara. We meet Sindhu amidst all the hype, where she is jubilant about her victory. Her effervescent persona radiates positivity and a sense of calm, putting our team at ease, as she trawls for outfits with the enthusiasm of a little girl, but handles the shoot like a pro! From excitedly pointing out her house to us from a distance, visible from the window of the Grand Presidential Suite, to talking about her sister and niece, there is something refreshingly candid and free-spirited about the reigning queen of badminton. Excerpts from an exclusive interview.For me, it\u2019s not just over with one victory. When you keep winning, you want and need to win a lot more. That keeps me motivated. Every time I win, I don\u2019t just settle. When I won the silver at Rio, people told me I\u2019d achieved everything, but, for me, it was just the beginning. As for becoming a world champion, it is a wonderful feeling; it felt like I was on top of the world when I was on the podium, watching the Indian flag go up.I was thrilled when I heard about it. I\u2019m listed alongside some of the world\u2019s best sportswomen; it\u2019s a huge honour.There are ups and downs in everyone\u2019s life. You can\u2019t be on top all the time. When you lose, you learn a lot from your mistakes. Also, one cannot look at it as the end of the world. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe in myself, but I have to accept that sometimes, I am on top of my game, and sometimes it is just not my day. But there\u2019s always a next time.Definitely! My father used to play volleyball, and introduced me to badminton at the age of eight-and-a-half. People wondered why I chose a different sport, but I was passionate about the game. I\u2019m fortunate to have parents who understand what it\u2019s like to be a sportsperson. They understand how it works, and guide me at various levels.It happened gradually. When I started playing, no one thought I would get to this level. Then, I started winning tournaments at the state level and kept taking it a notch further. Soon after Li Xuerui won the gold medal at the London Olympics 2012, I won against her, and that\u2019s when I realised I could aim higher.If you want to achieve something, you need to put something else on the backburner. It is tough, but I don\u2019t view it as a burden because badminton is my passion, and I enjoy what I\u2019m doing.Well, every public figure has to. When you win big tournaments, people put you on a pedestal, but when you lose, they are harsh, and troll you. I don\u2019t take it to heart or let it affect my psyche. When I step onto the court, I give my 100 per cent. People can say or write a lot of things, but one has to do what one feels is right, and rely on instinct.I start my day at 5.45 am, and am on court from 6.30 am till 11.30 am. After that, I train at Suchitra Academy in Hyderabad, post which I take my lunch break. I play again from 4.30 pm to 6.30 pm. It\u2019s early to bed and early to rise for me, because I believe rest is important.Fitness is very important, not only in badminton but in every sport. We play long matches so endurance is key as well. As far as diet goes, I ensure to eat a lot of protein. I steer clear of oily and fried food since any weight gain affects agility and movement on the court.The top 10-15 players are at the same level. It\u2019s who plays best on that day that matters.We don\u2019t train together and we have our own practice sessions, so I don\u2019t get to see her often. When I do meet her, we are cordial.It\u2019s not going to be easy! The Olympic qualifications are going on, and I hope I do well. My ultimate goal is a gold medal, and I\u2019m working hard for it.I love Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, as well as Serena Williams who made a great comeback post her maternity break. Usain Bolt is another favourite. Among badminton players, Lin Dan is a legend!I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m friendly and jovial. I am not aggressive as I am on court\u2014I\u2019m different. At home, I\u2019m just a girl who loves spending time with her family.At times, it gets tough. But I enjoy it when people ask for photos and autographs. When I was young, I used to see other people enjoying the limelight, and wanted the same. I feel privileged when people tell me I inspire them. Millions cheer and support and pray for me; I\u2019m truly blessed.It not just a year or two of hard work. Many years and plenty of sacrifices go into it. One also needs to understand if he/she has an aptitude to pursue professional sports. Parents should not assume that if they enroll their children in a certain academy, the kids will become champions. However, women are doing well now, not just in sports but every field. My advice is to believe in yourself, face life headlong, and never be afraid of anything.by Ankit Sharma", "description": "Shuttler PV Sindhu has consistently broken records that are milestones for Indian sportswomen.
