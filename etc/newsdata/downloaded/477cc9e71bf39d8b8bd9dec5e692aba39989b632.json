Drinking tequila and yelling were also common, they said.\n\nScrutiny of Neumann and his leadership has intensified in the past few weeks after the We Company filed paperwork for an IPO. He stepped down as CEO on Tuesday.\n\nBusiness Insider talked to 20 people in an investigation into what it was like working under Neumann\u2019s leadership as he grew We into one of the world\u2019s most valuable startups.\n\nRead the full story: Sex, tequila, and a tiger: Employees inside Adam Neumann\u2019s WeWork talk about the non-stop party to attain a $100 billion dream and the messy reality that tanked it\n\nRead more WeWork news here.\n\nAsk anyone who has worked closely with ousted WeWork CEO Adam Neumann and you will likely hear stories about him walking around barefoot.\n\nHe walks barefoot in the office, people close to him tell us. He walks barefoot around the Hamptons, where he owns a home, people who have seen him there tell us. And he also walks barefoot around the streets of New York, according to a photo of him posted on Reddit.\n\nThe photo was posted a day after Neumann resigned as CEO. And although the person who posted it said it was taken right before that news broke, we were unable to determine when it was taken. A person close to him tells us Neumann was wearing different clothing on the day he stepped down.\n\nWhen Business Insider talked to dozens of former employees about what it was like to work at WeWork under Neumann\u2019s tenure, we heard three types of stories repeatedly: seeing him barefoot, his love for an expensive brand of tequila, and his outbursts.\n\nNeumann was seen as the fiery, inspirational visionary, current and former employees told us. Multiple employees who worked closely with him, some from the early days, said his ability to motivate employees and \u201cpitch the living hell out of the company,\u201d was his superpower.\n\nThey described him as quick to celebrate with shots of his beloved $140/bottle Don Julio 1942 tequila. But he could grow \u201cfurious\u201d if shot glasses weren\u2019t handily available, one former employee us.\n\nAnother former employee remembered two demands every time Neumann visited a WeWork location: cases of Don Julio 1942 \u2013 \u201cif you don\u2019t have that, he will lose his sh*t\u201d \u2013 and music blasting at party volumes. \u201cOur paying customers would be complaining about how loud the music was, but if we turned it down, we\u2019d get screamed and yelled at by Adam and his team.\u201d\n\nThis person also remembers, \u201cHe would run around the office barefoot. He would jump on his desk, or jump on the conference table barefoot and yell at people.\u201d\n\nNot all of that yelling was negative. Some of it was exuberance.\n\nA third former employee described working with Adam like this: \u201cA lot of WeWork feels like a never-ending party. It\u2019s always up or down, and Adam\u2019s screaming both ways, happy or not.\u201d\n\nThis has been a tumultuous few weeks for Neumann since the company released its pre-IPO filing. Intense public scrutiny ensued over the company\u2019s business model and governance. And last week, WeWork announced that Neumann had given up most of his voting power and resigned as CEO, staying on as non-executive chairman.\n\nNeumann said the focus on him had become \u201ca distraction\u201d for the company. A statement given to Business Insider by Neumann\u2019s representative in response to our investigation into WeWork\u2019s culture and leadership said: \u201cwhile there may have been some growing pains, the results speak for themselves: a nurturing work environment that is inspiring, respectful, and attuned to bringing out the best in people.\u201d\n\nAre you a WeWork insider with insight to share?
