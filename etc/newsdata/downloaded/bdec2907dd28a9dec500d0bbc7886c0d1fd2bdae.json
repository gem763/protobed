After a split in early 2017, as seen in the chart above, the \"jobs of the future\" index has largely tracked hiring in general.\n\nThis suggests there might not be some special magic in these jobs \u2014 or, perhaps, that the makeup of the leading edge of work has already changed since Cognizant first assembled the bundle a year ago.\n\nRob Brown, VP of Cognizant's Center for the Future of Work, argues there's no particular reason for the parallel movement.\n\nMost future-oriented jobs are increasingly in demand, like health information managers and robotics engineers. But, surprisingly, tech consultants are among a few jobs that dove in Cognizant's most recent analysis.\n\nBen Pring, director of the Center for the Future of Work, says that could be because big companies, recognizing the long-term value of tech experts, are hustling to hire them rather than relying on consultants from outside firms like Accenture or, yes, Cognizant.\n\nPlus, AI models that once required a PhD to set up are becoming easier to use without specialized training, potentially diminishing the value of pricey consultants.\n\nCognizant picked mostly white-collar jobs for the index, but several jobs outside that category are also good candidates for the list, too, either because they're byproducts of the tech industry or because they are difficult to automate with today's technology.\n\nOne example: workers who label data that trains AI. That's a boring, repetitive job, but one that's in huge demand because labeled data is critical for AI systems. It is, however, in danger of being automated itself down the line.\n\nManual labor that varies from day to day \u2014 like plumbing or construction, for example \u2014 is extremely hard for robots (for some of the reasons outlined in item 2 above). People will continue doing that work for some time.\n\nThe big question: What happens when the economy eventually tanks?", "description": "It's not clear how future-proof work would weather an economic downturn.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/MgxG2c5K5UtYY2F_8iROjtrPIkk=/0x0:3000x1688/1920x1080/2019/10/26/1572126281924.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
