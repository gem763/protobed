That compares to \u00a311.8 billion for the same period in the previous year.\n\n\u201cA lot of EU buyers seem to have decided that the risks of Brexit are now quite well-understood, and that they don\u2019t present a barrier to making acquisitions if the price is right.\u201d James West, Mayer Brown\n\nForeign exchange markets have been betting heavily against sterling since July when Boris Johnson became prime minister. The British pound is expected to fall further if Johnson crashes out of the EU without an agreement.\n\nJames West, partner in the private equity practice at Mayer Brown, said despite fears of a no-deal Brexit, the low cost of buying U.K. companies is outweighing concerns.\n\n\u201cA lot of EU buyers seem to have decided that the risks of Brexit are now quite well-understood, and that they don\u2019t present a barrier to making acquisitions if the price is right,\u201d he said.\n\nWest added: \u201cThere will always be a market for high-quality businesses, regardless of what is happening in politics.

This was mainly driven by a fall in acquisitions by U.S. bidders from \u00a383.6 billion to \u00a349.8 billion.
