Has any restaurant gone from three stars to no stars before?\n\n\u201cCan't be to do with change of chef, as M say stars go to restaurants, not chefs, and there are plenty that retained stars yesterday despite chef changes.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, fellow Mayfair restaurant Sketch Lecture Room & Library in Mayfair was announced as the only new restaurant in Great Britain and Ireland to achieve three Michelin stars.\n\nThe restaurant is overseen by French chef Pierre Gagnaire, who also has a three Michelin-starred restaurant at the Hotel Balzac in Paris.\n\nOther London winners included La Dame de Pic, which has graduated from one Michelin star to two, while four other restaurants earned their first star, including Nuno Mendes\u2019s Maos in Shoreditch, Endo at the Rotunda in White City, Da Terra in Bethnal Green and The Dysart Petersham in Richmond.\n\nThe full list of new Michelin star restaurants in the UK can be found here.", "description": "A high-end sushi restaurant in Mayfair has been stripped of all three of its Michelin stars.
