I'm mad. I'm upset. And I feel it's partly my fault,' Smith said. 'If I had never dialed the police department, she'd still be alive.'\n\nSmith said Jefferson and her nephew typically lived with an older woman, who's been in the hospital.\n\n'It makes you not want to call the police department,' he said.\n\nAtatiana's family said she was playing video games with her eight-year-old nephew early Saturday morning just before she was shot\n\nThe victim's family said she and her nephew thought they heard a prowler outside shortly before she walked in front of a window in their Fort Worth home\n\nBody cam footage of the incident shows the responding officer who shot Jefferson never told her he was a police man before opening fire a split second after telling her to 'show me your hands'\n\nThe police department said they recovered a handgun from the home, but did not say where the gun was found in the home or whether the officer who shot Jefferson saw the weapon before opening fire\n\nIn an audio recording of Smith's call that was released by police, the neighbor said it was 'not normal' for the house to leave its front door open for hours at that time of day.\n\nMerritt said Jefferson's family expects 'a thorough and expedient investigation.'\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Department said it released bodycam footage soon after the shooting to provide transparency, but that any 'camera footage inside the residence' could not be distributed due to state law.\n\nHowever, the bodycam video released to media included blurred still frames showing a gun inside a bedroom at the home.\n\nThis statement on Atatiana Jefferson's police shooting death was released by the Fort Worth Police Department on Saturday\n\nThe police statement released Saturday said only that officers who entered the residence after the shooting found a firearm.

Brandon O'Neil called Jefferson's death an 'unspeakable loss'\n\n'Our young people are not going to tolerate this, no matter how much we tell them to be cool, remain calm, that justice will be served,' Kyev told WFAA. 'When another mother loses her wife, a caregiver for both her eight-year-old nephew and a grandparent, loses her life in her own home, there's something grossly wrong with the Fort Worth Police Department and they refuse to take responsibility for their actions.'\n\nThe video released by police shows two officers searching the home from the outside with flashlights before one shouts, 'Put your hands up, show me your hands.' One shot is then fired through a window.\n\nThe man who pulled the trigger never identifies himself as police to Jefferson. The police department so far has declined to release the name of the offending officer.\n\nBut they told WFAA he is a white man who has been with the department since April of last year. He has been placed on paid administrative leave.", "description": "The father of the black 28-year-old aspiring doctor shot and killed by a police officer inside her own home early Saturday morning spoke to reporters for the first time Sunday night.", "authors": ["Chauncey Alcorn For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/05/19677230-0-image-a-46_1571029120835.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
