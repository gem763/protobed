It wasn\u2019t just a two-page document that we signed, so that we could do another two-page document.\u201d\n\nBrennan asked if he meant he wouldn\u2019t negotiate with the Trump administration without it bringing back the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was negotiated by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in 2015. Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an old deal,\u201d Zarif said. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal that exists now. There is a negotiating room.
