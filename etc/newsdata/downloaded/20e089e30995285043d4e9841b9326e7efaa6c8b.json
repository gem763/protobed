Fearing U.S. abandonment, the Kurds opened a back channel to the Syrian government and the Russians in 2018, and those talks ramped up significantly in recent weeks, American, Kurdish and Russian officials told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cWe warned the Kurds that the Americans will ditch them,\u201d Russia\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, told Russia\u2019s Tass news agency on Monday.\n\nThe switch in allegiances is a stark illustration of how American foes like Russia and Syria are working steadily to fill the vacuum left by President Donald Trump\u2019s retreat in the region. It also betrays the anxiety that U.S. allies across the globe now feel in the face of Trump\u2019s seemingly impulsive foreign policy decisions, which often come as a surprise to allies and critics alike.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
