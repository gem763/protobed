PTR, -1.48% 857, -1.74% .\n\nOfficials in Beijing didn\u2019t immediately acknowledge their decision. Phone calls to the CNPC rang unanswered on Sunday and its website bore no mention of the withdrawal.\n\nHowever, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif separately complained Sunday about the U.S. campaign against Tehran and its impact on foreign investments.\n\n\u201cWe have been facing plenty of problems in the field of investment because of the U.S. maximum pressure policy,\u201d Zarif told a parliamentary committee, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. \u201cWe are trying to remove the problems.\u201d\n\nTehran-based political analyst Saeed Leilaz said he believes that despite China\u2019s departure from the project, \u201cChina will remain Iran\u2019s main trade partner.\u201d\n\nLeilaz said that\u2019s because a large portion of past oil revenue from China has remained in the country, enabling Tehran to buy goods it needs from China without transferring money from Iran, thereby evading U.S. sanctions on Iran\u2019s banking system.\n\nIran holds the world\u2019s second-largest known reserves of natural gas and the world\u2019s fourth-largest oil reserves.\n\nMuch of its natural gas comes from its massive South Pars field, which it shares with Qatar. The initial plan for the development of South Pars involved building 20 wells and two wellhead platforms, a project that would have a capacity of 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day.\n\nUnder terms of the initial deal, Total FP, +0.20% was to have a 50.1% stake, with CNPC getting 30% and the Iranian firm Petropars getting 19.9%. With Total\u2019s withdrawal, CNPC had taken over the French firm\u2019s stake. Now Petropars will develop the field alone, Zangeneh said.\n\nTotal first pulled out of Iran in 2006 as United Nations sanctions first took hold over fears Iran\u2019s atomic program would be used to build nuclear weapons. Tehran has maintained its program is only for peaceful purposes. Iran cancelled another CNPC contract in 2012 amid increasing international sanctions which led to the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nAfter withdrawing from the nuclear deal with Tehran over a year ago, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Iran that have kept it from selling its oil abroad and have crippled its economy. Iran has since begun breaking terms of the nuclear deal. In late September, the U.S. sanctioned Chinese shipping firms it said were ferrying Iranian crude oil.\n\nThere also have been a series of attacks across the Middle East that the U.S. blames on Iran. Tensions reached their height on Sept. 14, with a missile and drone attack on the world\u2019s largest oil processor in Saudi Arabia and an oil field, which caused oil prices to spike by the biggest percentage since the 1991 Gulf War. While Yemen\u2019s Iranian-allied Houthi rebels claimed the assault, Saudi Arabia says it was \u201cunquestionably sponsored by Iran.\u201d\n\nIran denies being responsible and has warned any retaliatory attack targeting it will result in an \u201call-out war.\u201d", "description": "China\u2019s state oil company has pulled out of a $5 billion deal to develop a portion of Iran\u2019s massive offshore natural gas field, the Islamic Republic\u2019s oil...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS736_iranoi_ZG_20191006165849.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
