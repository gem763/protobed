Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersWarren to protest with striking Chicago teachers Sanders: 'Outrageous' to suggest Gabbard 'is a foreign asset' Democratic strategist: Sanders seeking distance from Warren could 'backfire' MORE (I-Vt.).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThose new stances were on display at last week\u2019s Democratic debate, when Buttigieg and Warren engaged in a high-profile clash over Medicare for All, with Warren defending the progressive proposal and Buttigieg attacking it.\n\nThe shifts also illustrate how Medicare for All has emerged as perhaps the leading point of contention among the White House hopefuls, with the progressive wing doubling down on its support and more moderate candidates increasingly going on the attack.\n\n\u201c[Medicare for All] has become the defining ideological issue in the Democratic race,\u201d said Democratic strategist Brad Bannon. \u201cSupport for Medicare for All means you\u2019re a progressive, and opposition to Medicare for All means you\u2019re a moderate.\u201d\n\nButtigieg went after Warren when he argued that his plan to allow people the option of a government-run insurance plan or to keep their private plans is \u201cjust better than Medicare for All whether you want it or not.\u201d He added that Warren\u2019s approach would \u201cobliterate private plans.\u201d\n\nBut last year, Buttigieg said he supported Medicare for All.\n\n\u201cI, Pete Buttigieg, politician, do henceforth and forthwith declare, most affirmatively and indubitably, unto the ages, that I do favor Medicare for All, as I do favor any measure that would help get all Americans covered,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nHe also defended single-payer as a \u201ccompromise position\u201d on MSNBC as recently as February.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s campaign argues that he has not changed his position, saying he has always supported Medicare for All as an end goal but that his optional plan allows for a gradual \u201cglide path\u201d in the meantime.\n\nWarren, for her part, counterattacked at last week\u2019s debate by deriding Buttigieg\u2019s optional plan as \u201cMedicare for all who can afford it.\u201d\n\nShe called Medicare for All the \u201cgold standard.\u201d\n\nBut earlier this year, Warren expressed more openness to different approaches, including proposals for an optional government-run plan that people could buy into, along the same general lines of what Buttigieg is proposing now.\n\n\u201cOne of the options that is certainly under discussion is to let employers buy into Medicare rather than having to go into the insurance business themselves or having to negotiate out on the private market,\u201d Warren told reporters in February. \u201cSo a lot of options on the table, a lot of good things for us to talk about. But they all aim in the same direction, and that is that health care is a basic human right.\u201d\n\nShe expressed a similar view at a CNN town hall in March, saying there are \u201ca lot of different pathways.\u201d\n\nThree months later, Warren offered a stronger defense of Sanders\u2019s bill, declaring at the first debate: \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie on Medicare for All.\u201d\n\nAnything less than 100 percent backing would have run the risk of giving Sanders an opening to shore up support among the party\u2019s progressive primary voters.\n\nSen.

In January, she famously said, \u201cLet\u2019s eliminate all of that,\u201d in reference to private insurance. She later developed her own plan, which would maintain a role for private insurers.\n\nAmong the more consistent candidates are Sanders, who has championed Medicare for All for years, and Biden, a staunch opponent of Medicare for All who prefers an optional government-run plan.\n\nWarren, under pressure over how she will pay for her main health care plan, said Sunday she would soon release a proposal detailing which taxes she would raise to finance Medicare for All.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe cost of Medicare for All is a daunting $32 trillion over 10 years, though supporters argue that if structured the right way, the middle class would end up paying less once the elimination of premiums and deductibles is factored in.\n\nButtigieg and Biden argue that an optional government-run plan is much less costly and not nearly as disruptive.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to Medicare for All, Mayor Pete is doubling down on the idea it will be a political loser in such states as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania,\u201d said Democratic strategist Jim Manley.\n\n\u201cAt the start of the cycle I was hoping against hope Medicare for All wasn\u2019t going to be a litmus test for the party,\u201d Manley said, but noted that more and more it seems to be.\n\nAs she embraces Sanders\u2019s position on Medicare for All, Warren has surpassed him in the polls as the top progressive candidate.\n\n\u201cWarren has used her support for Medicare for All and the Green New Deal to become the progressive standard bearer,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cWarren has already done to Sanders what Mayor Pete wants to do with Biden.\u201d", "description": "Democratic presidential candidates are shifting their positions on \u201cMedicare for All\u201d as they battle for different wings of the party.South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg praised Medicare for All earlier this year, but now is attacking Sen.
