He studied in the U.S. and works for an SK Group affiliate.\n\nPolice arrested the dealer last month, and he told them he supplied both men with cannabis, of which Korean law enforcement takes a dimmer view than many advanced countries'.\n\nPolice said the probe is being expanded to look into possible offenses by other chaebol heirs as a climate of hostility to the shenanigans of conglomerate families continues.\n\n", "description": "SK, Hyundai Scions Investigated for Drug Abuse", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-04-02"}
