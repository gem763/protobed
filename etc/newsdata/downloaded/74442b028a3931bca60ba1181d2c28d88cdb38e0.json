He used a speech at the National Press Club (pictured) to call on Trump to 'stop invoking fear'\n\nCummings' long career spanned decades in Maryland politics. He rose through the ranks of the Maryland House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in a special election in 1996 to replace former Rep. Kweisi Mfume, who left the seat to lead the NAACP.\n\nCummings was an early supporter of Barack Obama's presidential bid in 2008. And by 2016, Cummings was the senior Democrat on the House Benghazi Committee, which he said was 'nothing more than a taxpayer-funded effort to bring harm to Hillary Clinton's campaign' for president.\n\nThroughout his career, Cummings used his fiery voice to highlight the struggles and needs of inner-city residents. He was a firm believer in some much-debated approaches to help the poor and addicted, such as needle exchange programs as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS.\n\nHis constituents began mourning shortly after his death at 2:45 a.m. on Thursday. The Baltimore archdiocese tweeted that Cummings 'generously shared his God-given gifts and talents w/the people of his beloved city, state and nation for so many years. We give thanks for his dedicated service and pray for the repose of his soul.'\n\nDonald Trump defended his criticism of Congressman Elijah Cummings and his district, claiming there was 'nothing racist' about him speaking the truth about the conditions in Baltimore, Maryland and how Cummings has dealt with it\n\nIn response to claims his comments were racist, Trump tweeted he was just 'stating plainly what most people already know'\n\nHe said Cummings needs to focus on 'fixing the mess' in Baltimore instead of seeking impeachment investigations on the House Oversight Committee or criticizing the conditions at the border\n\nCummings was born on Jan. 18, 1951. In grade school, a counselor told Cummings he was too slow to learn and spoke poorly, and he would never fulfill his dream of becoming a lawyer.\n\n'I was devastated,' Cummings told The Associated Press in 1996, shortly before he won his seat in Congress. 'My whole life changed. I became very determined.'\n\nIt steeled Cummings to prove that counselor wrong. He became not only a lawyer, but one of the most powerful orators in the statehouse, where he entered office in 1983.\n\nHe rose to become the first black House speaker pro tem. He would begin his comments slowly, developing his theme and raising the emotional heat until it became like a sermon from the pulpit.\n\nCummings was quick to note the differences between Congress and the Maryland General Assembly, which has long been controlled by Democrats.\n\n'After coming from the state where, basically, you had a lot of people working together, it's clear that the lines are drawn here,' Cummings said about a month after entering office in Washington in 1996.\n\nCummings chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 2003 to 2004, employing a hard-charging, explore-every-option style to put the group in the national spotlight.\n\nHe cruised to big victories in the overwhelmingly Democratic district, which had given Maryland its first black congressman in 1970 when Parren Mitchell was elected.", "description": "Elijah E Cummings, a senior Democrat who was a key figure in the Trump impeachment inquiry as head of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, died early Thursday aged 68.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/10/19830554-0-image-a-19_1571305968073.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
