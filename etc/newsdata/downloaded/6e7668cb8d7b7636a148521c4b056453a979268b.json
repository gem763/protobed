(AP) - Arizona scored one touchdown on a bursting run, hit some chunk plays in the passing game.\n\nWhen it mattered most, the Wildcats played the power game - and Texas Tech was helpless to stop them.\n\nArizona ran the ball 13 straight times during a 99-yard drive in the fourth quarter and Gary Brightwell capped it with his second touchdown, lifting the Wildcats to a 28-14 win over Texas Tech Saturday night.\n\n\u201cThey imposed their will on us,\u201d Red Raiders coach Matt Wells said. \u201cThat\u2019s tough to take.\u201d\n\nKhalil Tate accounted for 314 yards and two touchdowns, including an 84-yard run, and Arizona (2-1) racked up 499 total yards in what was expected to be an offensive showcase in the desert.\n\nThe deciding drive was power-driven.\n\nBacked up to their 1-yard line in the fourth quarter, the Wildcats ran the ball right down the Red Raiders\u2019 throat, 13 times in all until Brightwell scored on a 1-yard run with four minutes left.\n\n\u201cTo go 99 yards to win the game, that is a step that should give us confidence heading into conference play,\u201d Arizona coach Kevin Sumlin said.\n\nThe Wildcats also bounced back from shaky defensive performances their first two games, keeping Texas Tech\u2019s vaunted passing game under control most of the night.\n\nAlan Bowman threw for 311 yards and hit McLane Mannix on an 8-yard touchdown to put the Red Raiders (2-1) up 14-13 in the third quarter.\n\nTexas Tech couldn\u2019t hold its ground against the Wildcats after that, pushed around during two fourth quarter drives capped by Brightwell 1-yard touchdowns.\n\n\u201cWe just physically wore down,\u201d Wells said. \u201cTeams that run the ball like Arizona, they make the pay.\u201d\n\nArizona\u2019s offense was sharp the first two games, averaging 629.5 yards and 51.5 points per game.\n\nTexas Tech has had one of the nation\u2019s most prolific offenses since the Mike Leach days and won its first two games by a combined score of 83-13.\n\nThe expected offensive showdown never really got going.\n\nThe Red Raiders and Wildcats had four turnovers in a span of five possessions in the first quarter: Two Bowman interceptions, a fumble and interception by Tate.\n\nT.J. Vasher seemed to get Texas Tech going with a diving 39-yard catch, setting up SaRodorick Thompson\u2019s 1-yard TD run.\n\nDarrius Smith jumpstarted Arizona by turning a screen pass into a 46-yard gain, setting the stage for Tate\u2019s 12-yard scoring pass to Stanley Berryhill III.\n\nTate followed with an 84-yard touchdown run, but the offenses went dormant again for the rest of the half.\n\n\u201cEveryone expected this big offensive game, but both defenses played well,\u201d Wells said.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTexas Tech was solid defensively in two opening wins, but got shoved around by Arizona in its first big test of the season.\n\nArizona appears to be back on track after an opening loss to Hawaii and a shaky second-half defensive performance last week against Northern Arizona.\n\nSMITH EJECTED\n\nTexas Tech lost one of its starting defensive backs in the second quarter when cornerback Desmon Smith was ejected for targeting.\n\nSmith was called for a personal foul when he lowered his head to tackle Berryhill on a 22-yard gain. Smith hit Berryhill helmet to helmet and was ejected following a video review.\n\nTATE\u2019S TD\n\nTate put himself in the Heisman Trophy conversation with his running and passing ability as a sophomore in 2017. Hampered by injuries and a new offensive system, he wasn\u2019t nearly as effective last season, rarely taking off on runs.\n\nTate gave Arizona fans a flashback with his second quarter run, making one defender miss and sprinting past two more on his 84-yard touchdown.\n\n\u201cWe put some more run plays in this week,\u201d Tate said. \u201cWe knew that would be an X factor this week, allowing me to use my legs more.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTexas Tech opens its Big 12 season at No. 5 Oklahoma on Sept. 28.\n\nArizona opens Pac-12 play against UCLA on Sept. 28.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Arizona scored one touchdown on a bursting run, hit some chunk plays in the passing game.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Marshall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/texas_tech_arizona_football_62988_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
