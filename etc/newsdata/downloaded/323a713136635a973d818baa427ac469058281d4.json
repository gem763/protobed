Soldiers arrested the kingpin\u2019s heir several hours earlier in an operation that triggered shootouts in Culiacan on Thursday.\n\nOn Thursday, Mexican military forces arrested Ovidio \u201cEl Raton\u201d Guzman Lopez in Culiacan, Sinaloa.\n\nDuring his Friday morning press conference, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) tried to deflect from the topic by talking about security in another state, but eventually confirmed his cabinet released Guzman Lopez to avoid further violence.\n\n\u201cThere can\u2019t be a higher value on a criminal\u2019s capture than in the lives of people,\u201d AMLO said as he tried to explain his approach of not fighting cartels with violence\u2013but with programs addressing social issues and injustices.\n\nAMLO also disclosed that the arrest operation was based on a federal warrant \u201cwith extradition purposes\u201d to the United States.\n\nThe arrest led to mass chaos as cartel gunmen carried out various acts of terror, including a breakout in the Aguaruto Prison. Several shootouts and threats of violence targeting civilians were also issued. Cartel gunmen even threatened to kill the wives and children of soldiers in Culiacan. Authorities disclosed Friday that the Sinaloa Cartel managed to kidnap several soldiers and used them as leverage to trade for Guzman Lopez.\n\nDuring a televised news conference on Thursday night, Public Safety Secretary Alfonso Durazo gave a vague version of events where he appears to reveal that security forces released Guzman Lopez.\n\nMensaje del Gabinete de Seguridad sobre los hechos suscitados en Culiac\u00e1n, Sinaloa: pic.twitter.com/gQ0pwrryr0 \u2014 Secretar\u00eda de Seguridad y Protecci\u00f3n Ciudadana (@SSPCMexico) October 18, 2019\n\n\u201cWith the purpose of safeguarding the superior good of the integrity of Culiacan\u2019s society, officials with the Security Cabinet agreed to stop such actions,\u201d Durazo said in a televised statement. Since then, various news outlets in Mexico have independently confirmed the release of Ovidio.\n\nOne of those confirmations came from Jose Luis Gonzalez Mesa, an attorney for the Guzman family who gave various TV interviews in Mexico.\n\n#Entrevista \u201cOvidio Guzm\u00e1n, se encuentra bien, ya se comunic\u00f3 con su familia: Jos\u00e9 Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Meza, abogado de #ElChapo #AzucenaxMilenio pic.twitter.com/UbdzUFCfIX \u2014 Azucena Uresti (@azucenau) October 18, 2019\n\nPrior to his release, according to SinEmbargo.mx, a group of gunmen attacked a prison in Culiacan, allowing the prisoners to escape. A video posted on social media revealed the moment when a large number of inmates can be seen running out of the facility.\n\nEn estos momentos la SSPE confirma una fuga en el Penal de Aguaruto en #Culiac\u00e1n. pic.twitter.com/gpWvZLydYW \u2014 Juan Pablo P\u00e9rez D\u00edaz (@PerezDiazMX) October 17, 2019\n\nOvidio is one of 10 sons that El Chapo Guzman had in his three marriages. Currently, the elder drug lord is serving a life term in prison in the U.S. after a lengthy trial that exposed the highest levels of Mexico\u2019s government and security apparatus as receiving money from cartels.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
