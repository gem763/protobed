I haven\u2019t spoken to Rudy.\n\n\u201cI spoke to him yesterday briefly. He\u2019s a very good attorney and he has been my attorney, yeah, sure.\u201d\n\nHe eventually defended his lawyer on Saturday, writing on Twitter: \u201cSo now they are after the legendary \u2018crime buster\u2019 and greatest mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani. He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer.\u201d\n\nBut Mr Trump\u2019s apparent move to distance himself from Mr Giuliani reinforces CNN\u2019s reports that several of the president\u2019s aides are warning him that his attorney could be damaging his defence in the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe scrutiny surrounding Mr Giuliani intensified on Wednesday after two Republican donors with alleged ties to his dealings in Ukraine were arrested on campaign finance charges, both of whom have been pictured with Mr Trump, Mr Giuliani and Mike Pence.\n\nAnd the The New York Times reported that federal prosecutors had opened an investigation into whether Mr Giuliani broke lobbying laws during efforts to undermine the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nMr Giuliani denied knowledge of such an investigation, and also contradicted Mr Trump\u2019s ambivalence over his employment and their recent communications.\n\n\u201cI am still his lawyer until he tells me I\u2019m not \u2026 I spoke to him yesterday and I have no reason to believe I\u2019m not,\u201d he told New York Magazine\u2019s Olivia Nuzzi.\n\nMr Giuliani said he did not think the president was \u201cpreparing to throw him under the bus\u201d, but refused to say whether he would be surprised if Mr Trump did so in the future.\n\nThe probe into the former New York mayor is said to be tied to his relationship with the two Ukrainian businessmen arrested on Wednesday \u2013 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.\n\nThe pair are accused of sending funds to a congressman they hoped would help oust Ms Yovanovitch, in addition to charges of conspiracy and falsifying records, and were arrested at a Washington airport in possession of one-way tickets out of the country.\n\nOn Friday, Ms Yovanovitch defied a government-wide ban by Mr Trump to testify in front of House impeachment investigators, claiming that Mr Trump had personally pressured the State Department to remove her from her position as ambassador.\n\nMs Yovanovitch said in a prepared statement: \u201cAlthough I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the US government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d\n\nThe transcript of Mr Trump\u2019s now-infamous phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy revealed Mr Trump had described the former ambassador as \u201cbad news\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by AP\n\nRead more\n\nTrump lawyer Rudy Giuliani \u2018under investigation\u2019 for lobbying Ukraine\n\nGiuliani attacks \u2018idiot press\u2019 during latest Fox News meltdown\n\nHow Rudy Giuliani became Trump\u2019s conspiratorial Ukraine fixer", "description": "Donald Trump has told reporters he doesn\u2019t know if Rudy Giuliani is still his personal attorney, as controversy grows around the president\u2019s key ally and his dealings in Ukraine.Asked on Friday if Mr Giuliani was still his lawyer, the president replied: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know.
