(AP) - NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year for 2018 Saquon Barkley has a high sprain to his right ankle and there is no immediate timetable for his return.\n\nOther than confirming it was a high ankle sprain, Giants coach Pat Shurmur didn\u2019t have much additional information to offer Monday, a day after rookie quarterback Daniel Jones rallied New York (1-2) from an 18-point deficit to a 32-31 win over Tampa Bay.\n\nBarkley was hurt with less than four minutes left in the first half. He caught a swing pass from Jones and was chopped down near the sideline by defensive back Mike Edwards. He had to be helped to the locker room before halftime and was on crutches and with a boot on the ankle in the second half.\n\nFormer Giants linebacker Olivier Vernon had a high ankle sprain last season and he missed the first five games of the regular season.\n\nShurmur also said linebacker Alec Ogletree pulled a hamstring in the second quarter and his replacement, Tae Davis, sustained a concussion in the second half.\n\nReceiver Russell Shepard also is being evaluated for a sprained foot. Shurmur seemed concerned about the injury but he did not say more.\n\nWayne Gallman is going to take over for Barkley, who had 10 rushes for 8 yards before being hurt. The Giants are probably going to have to sign another running back, Shurmur said. Eli Penny is the only other running back on the roster.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year for 2018 Saquon Barkley has a high sprain to his right ankle and there is no immediate timetable for his return.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Canavan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/giants_buccaneers_football_24297_c0-265-4200-2713_s1770x1032.jpg?4a319b68625663fdf24642217147f9998dbeadd7", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
