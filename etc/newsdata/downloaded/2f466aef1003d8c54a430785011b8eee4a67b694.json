Hardaker's talent on the field is undeniable but off it he has racked up a lengthy charge sheet which includes a 14-month ban after testing positive for cocaine and being caught drink driving last year.\n\nThat prompted the 27-year-old to enter the Sporting Chance clinic and he claims to have changed his ways since his last England cap against Samoa in Australia in May 2017. Hardaker said: \u201cIn 2017, I finished the game and I think I drank for three days solid afterwards.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just me, there were about 13 other lads. We went straight through drinking \u2013 drinking on the plane and then drinking when we got home.\n\n\u201cWe started in Sydney and finished in Manchester. I went straight through \u2013 drinking in Sydney, drinking to the airport, free drinks in the airport and then on the 24-hour flight back home.", "description": "Zak Hardaker drank for three days solid after his last rugby league international appearance, but he insists there will be no repeat following his shock Great Britain call-up.", "authors": ["Ross Heppenstall"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-league/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000187162444-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPSGJeyftEP9WNF5nKPELKYi42McaMWzoNEemnW6g8vI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
