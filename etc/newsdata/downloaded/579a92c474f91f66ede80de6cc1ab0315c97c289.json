They chose the latter.\n\nI happen to agree with that strategy, if one assumes that you only have one shot at this. But, I also propose another scenario: Do both. Draw up articles of impeachment on the narrow case of Ukraine, but don\u2019t close the impeachment inquiry. Keep it open and ready to draw up more articles as new corruption is uncovered. Impeach Trump repeatedly if necessary.\n\nThere is nothing in the Constitution that prevents a president from being impeached more than once.\n\nTrump and his administration are stonewalling in every way possible, refusing to produce administration officials for testimony and refusing to produce documents.\n\nIn many cases, Democrats in the House have taken the administration to court over its stonewalling, but court cases take time. It could be months, if not years, before there is a judgment in those cases.", "description": "A president should not be able to stonewall and run out the clock.", "authors": ["Charles M.
