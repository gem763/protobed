That's where Justin Choate lives.\n\nChoate, 43, has been around Louisiana's waters all of his life. He started working those marshes, streams and bayous with his father at the age of 9.\n\nWhen he's not serving as an alligator guide, he's out hunting nutria, the invasive, orange-toothed swamp rodent that's devouring Louisiana's coast.\n\nThe state's marshes are so overrun with nutria that it doesn't take long for Choate to bag enough to call it a day. A couple of times a week during hunting season, from November to March, he's out from daylight to 10 a.m. and then 3 p.m. to dark. It's easier working the swamps during the coolest hours.\n\nChoate kills at least 120 nutria a week, as many as 6,000 a season \u2014 his best day: 238 nutria in less than 11 hours.\n\nIf he doesn't kill them with his rifle, one of his three chocolate labs \u2014 Jake, Buck or Duke \u2014 will spot one, kill it and bring it back to the boat. Some days, the hunting dogs are quicker than Choate.\n\nJustin Choate- Thursday, Aug. 8, 2019. More\n\nFor the longest time, he and other hunters had only a few uses for the dead nutria \u2014 skin them for the fur, turn their tail in for $6 each from the state and use the rest as alligator bait.\n\nBut now there's another reason to make nutria a target. The destructive mammal that has hastened the loss of hundreds of miles of Louisiana coast now can serve as the main ingredient in dog treats.\n\n'This is not the wild west': Florida officials clarify stance on green iguanas, urging safety over hunting\n\nNutria as treats\n\nHansel Harlan wants to convert Louisiana's nutria problem into a nationally distributed dog biscuit. Marsh Dog, the Baton Rouge pet food company he co-founded, uses wild nutria as the main ingredient in its new generation of dog treats.\n\nIn 2012, the company received a grant from the Barataria-Terrebonne National Estuary Program to begin production of the dog treats, which mostly have been sold in Louisiana stores. But now Marsh Dog has partnered with a larger manufacturer, tweaked its production process and set its sights on building the brand.\n\nThe goal is to help to eliminate as many nutria as possible to reduce the destruction of Louisiana wetlands. There are no other commercially produced dog treats that use protein from non-domesticated mammals like nutria taken from the wild, Harlan said.\n\nThe company gets its nutria from the 4.1 million-acre estuary, located between the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers in south Louisiana.\n\nMarsh Dog gets the majority of its nutria meat from the 400 licensed trappers in the state, most of whom participate in the nutria control program with Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.\n\nYou gonna eat that roadkill? It's legal now in Oregon\n\nNutria were introduced to Louisiana in the 1930s for fur farming and released, either accidentally or intentionally, into the coastal marshlands according to Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries More\n\nAlthough the number of nutria killed by trappers each year has decreased, Harlan and his business partners hope to help increase that number.\n\nAfter the state control program began, 2010's hunting season ended with a record 445,936 nutria killed. That number dropped to a low of just over 170,000 killed in the 2018 season and about 223,000 killed when the last season ended in March.\n\nWith nutria averaging about six to 10 pounds each and each providing nearly half that in usable meat, Marsh Dog uses hundreds of thousands of pounds each year for their biscuits. The company could get rid of more than 55,000 nutria each year.", "description": "Nutria continue to cause damage to Louisiana wetlands and fewer are being killed each year.
