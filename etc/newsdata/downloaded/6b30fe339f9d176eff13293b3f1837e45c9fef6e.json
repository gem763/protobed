It was supposed to helpe assure its re-released Fold would be able to stand the test of time. But the company probably didn\u2019t think anyone would go through the trouble of actually testing the device for that many folds.\n\nLuckily for us, that\u2019s exactly what CNET and SquareTrade did, the latter which built a machine to fold the phone in rapid succession.\n\nUnluckily for Samsung, the device only lasted for about 60 percent of its claim \u2013 119, 380 folds. In other words, closer to about 3 years of use. You can view a condensed version of the test below; it breaks at about the 25:30 mark:\n\nBut okay, there are a few important caveats here. Most obvious is the speed and force which SquareTrade\u2019s robot uses to fold the device. For comparison, here\u2019s the 34-second video Samsung put out:\n\nSamsung said its test takes a \u201cfull week\u201d to perform, while at the rate CNET was folding the device, it would\u2019ve reached 200,000 folds in under a day.\n\nI don\u2019t know which one is closer to real use. Samsung\u2019s looks too gentle \u2013 there\u2019s no snap \u2013 while Squaretrade\u2019s seems too rough. Either way, they\u2019re clearly not testing the phones in the same manner.\n\nBesides, how many people do you know that keep their phones for more than three years anyway? I\u2019m all for our devices lasting longer, but few people I know have kept their devices for more than 2 years, especially on the Android side of the tech spectrum.\n\nIt\u2019s good to get some independent testing, but to me, this actually looks like a win for Samsung. We know from other tests the Galaxy Fold is no durability champion; there are necessary compromises to a plastic screen and new form factor. But that hinge, at least, seems to be the real deal.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F02%2FSamsung-Galaxy-Fold-hed.jpg&signature=72d0a0134f41c86f4838b86f2cb9d49c", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
