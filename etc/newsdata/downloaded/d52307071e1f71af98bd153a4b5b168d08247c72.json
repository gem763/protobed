Treasury has advised the government that QE can help the economy but can also have side effects.\n\n\"Unconventional monetary policies are worthy of consideration when conventional space has been eroded, but they are somewhat less direct, can have larger wealth effects through asset prices and can be difficult to unwind,\" says Ian Beckett, Treasury's head of macroeconomic modelling and policy.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has also come out in favour of QE as a measure for stimulating the economy, but it too has warned of some side effects.\n\nIn detailed responses to questions from a parliamentary economics committee, the RBA said the best empirical research shows that QE boosts employment and incomes.\n\n\"The first-order effect of quantitative easing is to increase incomes for households who would otherwise be unemployed,\" it said.\n\nThat's pretty clear. An expansion of the money supply provides cheaper lending for banks. That allows the banks to lend more at lower costs and potentially to borrowers with riskier profile. This leads to people investing more, through taking a loan either for a home or to expand their business and employ more people. This stimulates the economy.\n\nWhen the Reserve Bank is out buying financial assets such as corporate or government bond,s that also reduces the yield or the cost of borrowing and that drags the Australian dollar lower. A depreciating dollar makes exports cheaper, which boosts demand for our exports relative to other countries and again stimulates our economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are the simple mechanisms by which QE can help the economy.\n\nIn a report earlier this month by the Bank for International Settlements, signed off by RBA governor Philip Lowe, quantitative easing tools were again endorsed, but again there were also warnings about negative side effects.\n\nThose side effects could include squeezing commercial bank profits, inefficient allocation of credit which could include keeping so-called zombie companies alive, and reducing the private sector's incentive to deleverage.\n\nUnconventional monetary policy is can also include central banks cutting official interest rates to the point where they go negative. This is not QE - but it is unorthodox policy. Switzerland, the eurozone and Japan all have negative rates.\n\nWhen central banks apply negative interest rates, that lowers the rate commercial banks get on their reserve deposits. This motivates commercial banks to lend more.\n\nBut if those banks are lending out at lower and lower rates, they need to then borrow at lower and lower rates. This is called a net interest margin - and if they don't have that margin, then they can't make profits. The problem is that commercial banks feel very uncomfortable offering their customers negative rates on saving deposits.\n\nThis is all called the effective lower bound problem.\n\nAMP Capital's Shane Oliver says there is already evidence of this in Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There is some evidence that negative rates in Europe have boosted bank lending but cut into bank profits because banks are reluctant to take interest rates on bank deposits below zero and so further falls in lending rates lead to reduced profit margins, which may crimp lending,\" Oliver says.\n\n\"The thought of negative rates may also scare people,\" he adds.\n\nIf inflation is higher than the interest rate depositors are getting, then depositors are losing money.\n\n\"Sure, a 10 per cent bank deposit rate and 12 per cent inflation is really no different to a minus 1 per cent deposit rate and 1 per cent inflation \u2013 but the former would feel a lot better!\" Oliver says.\n\nSo with these potential problems from negative interest rates, it's no wonder Lowe told an audience earlier this month that \"negative interest rates are extraordinarily unlikely in my country\".\n\nSo if the RBA was to go down the road of unconventional monetary policy, most economists suspect it will take the route of an asset purchase program and quantitative easing, rather than negative interest rates.\n\nThe first step in this asset buying is to let the market know you are actually going to buy assets. This is called explicit forward guidance. This flags to the market that there is going to be more demand for securities. Investors jump in and buy, pushing up the price and lowering the yield in anticipation of the Reserve Bank coming in.\n\nWestpac's Evans points out two key assets areas where the RBA could buy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne option is government bonds. But there is a problem here. Of the current $600 billion of government bonds on issue, only $150 billion in bonds might be available for purchase.\n\n\"This limited free supply of bonds might mean that the RBA would not need to buy too many bonds to impact markets,\" Evans says.\n\nHowever, he notes that locking up too many bonds on the RBA\u2019s balance sheet might be counterproductive because governments are less likely to respond to lower interest rates. The government is keen to keep debt low even though this doesn't neccessarily help them protect a potential surplus.\n\nAnother key asset where the RBA would likely head is residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). These are basically pools of mortgages sold on as securities. If the RBA purchases thes,e it would lower the cost of funding such mortgages.\n\n\"It is reasonable to expect that if RBA QE applied to RMBS there would be considerable stimulus to supply lowering funding spreads and providing the RBA with a sharp boost to its monetary accommodation objectives,\" Evans says.\n\nThe advice from economists and the Treasury is that the RMBS option would be more attractive than purchasing government bonds, because the dominance of bank lending to households would be a more effective transmission channel to stimulating the economy.\n\nUltimately, though, whatever QE policy the RBA uses, it is likely to be effective.\n\n\"The Australian program could be proportionally smaller but still effective, since the presence of the RBA in the markets, particularly if the program was not formally capped, is likely to have a disproportionate impact on markets,\" Evans says.\n\nSo it seems it's not a matter of whether the central bank would use QE if it were needed, but, rather, when.", "description": "Economists believe that a limited program of unconventional monetary policy could be an outsize fillip to the economy.
