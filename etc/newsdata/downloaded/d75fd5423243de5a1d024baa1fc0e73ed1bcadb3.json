He\u2019s an entrepreneur who runs his own vegan food brand, but he\u2019s also 11 years old so it\u2019s not surprising that his mum has joined him.\n\nHe started his company, Dipalicious, in 2018 and since then has attracted a huge amount of attention (and awards) for his food, opened his first pop-up restaurant in August and is already looking to the next brand extensions.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nYou\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that he is the camera-friendly front for a pushy parent, but on meeting Omari, it is clear he is definitely the master of his own destiny and his ambitions (and confidence) know no bounds.\n\nHe caught the cooking bug when his father taught him and his brother how to cook when his mother was ill and his father was working long hours. Omari showed an early aptitude and passion for cooking and decided, as you do, that he wanted to make a business out of it.\n\n\u201cThe business came about after I went to Kidzania (an enterprise where children practise being in business) but I had to work for people there,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like that, so I came home and told my mum that I don\u2019t want to work for people \u2013 I want people to work for me. She asked me how I was going to do that, and I told her I was going to have my own business.\u201d\n\nHis mother Leah, who had been giving Omari and his brother some rudimentary lessons in entrepreneurship, assumed it was just because he didn\u2019t like being told what to do but when he explained his reasoning, she felt that she and her husband had to support him.\n\nApparently, the conversation went something like this:\n\nOmari: \u201cWorking for others is like a pyramid scheme, so why wouldn\u2019t I want to be at the top of my own pyramid?\u201d\n\nLeah: \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\nOmari: \u201cEveryone who owns a business is at the top of the pyramid and they get the most money?\u201d\n\nLeah: \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\nOmari: \u201cSo why wouldn\u2019t I want to do that?\u201d\n\nLeah: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\nWhich is a pretty simple but compelling argument for starting a business and an argument that many, more mature entrepreneurs, have no doubt had with themselves.\n\nIt started with YouTube videos (filmed by mum) of Omari cooking vegan meals and extolling the virtues of a vegan diet. In his first video, he made a vegan pizza that he decided, while delicious, was a bit dry. So he wanted an accompanying dip and, being unsure if ketchup was vegan, made his own.\n\nResearching online for what flavour combinations would work best, he came up with his own recipe and after a few stages of trial and error, found a combination he was happy with. And then immediately created two more flavours.\n\nI want to bring people together with my food. And I want to have restaurants all over the world just like Gordon Ramsay. But my biggest goal is to make sure my daddy doesn\u2019t have to drive a bus any more. Except for my bus\n\nFollowing a positive reaction to his dips at UltraKids Business Fair, the decision was made to start selling his dips to a wider audience. On the back of that, he now runs vegan cookery classes for kids from his home kitchen and is in the process of creating a line of vegan ready meals for kids.\n\nOmari is a beguiling combination of childlike innocence and impressive business clarity. There is no hint of the precocious stage kid, drilled relentlessly to deliver a polished act. He\u2019s fidgety, giggles uncontrollably at times, polite, respectful \u2013 just an average kid that has some inner drive most of us lack.\n\nLeah explains that while she sometimes finds it hard to keep up with his business ambitions, it\u2019s very much a family affair at the moment with Omari acting as the visionary.\n\nThey have a board of three (Omari, Leah and dad Jay) planning and executing the next moves. It goes without saying that mum and dad get lumbered with the admin but they work together to try to realise the vision that Omari has for his business.\n\nThat vision is somewhat childlike, but there is a conviction in Omari that is difficult to ignore.\n\n\u201cI want to bring people together with my food,\u201d he says with a smile.\n\n\u201cAnd I want to have restaurants all over the world just like Gordon Ramsay. But my biggest goal is to make sure my daddy doesn\u2019t have to drive a bus any more. Except for my bus.\u201d\n\nA key part of the dream is to have a restaurant on a bus so he (and his dad) can drive around bringing his vegan food to as many people as possible.\n\nBut if this sounds like the sweet but unobtainable dreams of a child, bear the following in mind. That pop-up restaurant he opened? Omari contacted Boxpark owner Roger Wade directly on LinkedIn, informing him that he was going to have a restaurant at the pop-up mall one day.\n\nSo impressed was Wade with Omari\u2019s business, approach and ambition, he asked why he couldn\u2019t do it now. So, after asking to speak to his mum, Wade agreed to waive the \u00a31,000 fee for a week\u2019s residency at the Croydon Boxpark and Omari was on the way to opening his first restaurant. At the age of 11.\n\nAnd it is that boldness, that fearlessness, found in most successful entrepreneurs, that suggests Omari\u2019s ambitions can be realised.\n\nBut is there anything that does worry or scare this impressive young entrepreneur?\n\n\u201cOnly spiders,\u201d he says with a giggle.", "description": "It\u2019s not unusual for an interview subject to arrive accompanied by a PR, but not many show up with their mum.
