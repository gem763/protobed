But they are still going\u2014and could affect the result of the next election.\n\nTrump has done his best to stonewall many of these matters, particularly those before Congress, by litigating almost every demand for testimony and other evidence. That strategy of maximum resistance could backfire.\n\nThat\u2019s because the string could well run out on many of Trump\u2019s defenses in the coming months, and the investigations\u2014and accompanying revelations\u2014could accelerate immediately before Election Day 2020, making Trump\u2019s misconduct a renewed focus of public attention as voters prepare to go to the polls.", "description": "Fall is here.
