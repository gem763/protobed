(As for Smollett\u2019s life? Well, that\u2019s another story entirely.) As was very briefly mentioned during the show\u2019s season premiere, Jamal and his fianc\u00e9 decided to move to London to escape the Lyon family\u2019s near-constant petty drama, in the hopes of restarting their lives with the help of Pimm\u2019s and a pledge of allegiance to Arsenal. Brexit be damned! Jamal\u2019s mother, Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) is the relayer of such intel, telling a pal the details during a night-in of pampering. \u201cNo wonder that boy ran off to London,\u201d Cookie joked, gesturing to her pink onesie. \u201cPlease don\u2019t get me started. I miss him so much.\u201d Smollett is still lying low after the criminal charges against him, for allegedly staging a hate crime, were dropped.", "description": "Jussie Smollett\u2019s Empire character, Jamal, was written out of Empire by moving to London with his fiance.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/25/25-jussie-smollett-empire.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
