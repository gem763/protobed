Sony\u2019s been showing it off at events, like the most recent State of Play livestream, but details have been a little scarce. A new limited time demo that came out today offers a sneak peek into the upcoming exclusive action-comedy game. The brief preview shows some of the game\u2019s silly world and characters, but ultimately, it feels a little generic, at least so far.\n\nThe original MediEvil released in 1998 for the Sony PlayStation. It tells the story of Sir Daniel Fortesque, a skeleton knight brought back to life in order to fight an evil sorcerer named Zarok. Even though legends paint Daniel as a gallant hero, he\u2019s a bit of a doofus, having died immediately to an arrow in the head during a battle against Zarok.\n\nAccidentally revived by one of Zarok\u2019s necromancy spells a century later, he gambols off to defeat the sorcerer. It\u2019s a silly set-up, and Daniel\u2019s grinning antics making for a fun affair. You can yank off your arm to smack zombies in the face and solve rudimentary puzzles. It\u2019s a bit more linear than the action and explorations games that would come after \u2014 Spyro, Jak and Daxter \u2014 but it\u2019s cut from a similar cloth. The PlayStation 4 version is a remake, and a demo called the Short Lived Demo is currently on the PlayStation Store until October 8.\n\nPlaying the demo earlier today, I found myself sucked into MediEvil\u2019s zany world but underwhelmed by the actual playing. The demo contains the first level of the game, which provides an early sense of the pacing and action. In playing it, I found swords and throw daggers, traipsed about a graveyard picking up collectibles, and opened plenty of locked doors.\n\nMedIEvil is a straightforward game, almost entirely linear, except for some occasional branching pathways that soon lead back to the main area again. It feels like an arcade game, a step up from Ghosts and Goblins or Fester\u2019s Quest. In that light, MediEvil as a fun blast from the past. In 2019, it\u2019s got stiffer competition.\n\nThe demo lives up to the \u201cshort-lived\u201d name, coming and going in about twenty minutes\u2019 time without leaving much of an impression. MediEvil is silly in that way that older games were, with grainy cutscenes and broad voice acting. It\u2019s also stiff and awkward to my modern eyes. I kept asking, \u201cWhy are we doing this, and why now?\u201d The demo isn\u2019t deep enough to answer that, although the original wasn\u2019t that deep, either. Cartoony graphics and a classic feel brought a warm tingle of nostalgia, but MediEvil wasn\u2019t all that exciting to play.\n\nIt\u2019s neat to see an old classic back from the dead, but MediEvil feels a bit perfunctory. We\u2019ve seen strong remakes in recent years such as Wonder Boy: The Dragon\u2019s Trap or the recent remake of Link\u2019s Awakening that have their own unique flair and build upon the source material.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case here, at least based on this demo. While it might please fans who loved the original, MediEvil\u2019s demo doesn\u2019t suggest that the game is prepared to meet the challenge of reaching a new, broader audience. Hopefully, the full game will breathe a little more life into this idea.", "description": "Did you know there\u2019s gonna be a new MediEvil game?
