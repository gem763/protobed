Employing the same open borders rationale as O\u2019Rourke, judges, policymakers and activists ensured that he was never deported. [Emphasis added] \u2026 Beto O\u2019Rourke has made it clear he wants the opposite. He wants us to believe that enforcing immigration law is tantamount to killing kids. [Emphasis added] That\u2019s a slap in the face not just to legal immigrants, but to everyone who has suffered from the sort of weak immigration enforcement that O\u2019Rourke desires. [Emphasis added]\n\nEvery year, about 2,000 Americans are killed by illegal aliens according to an analysis by Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL). Of the roughly 150,000 federal inmates in Bureau of Prisons custody, more than 40,000 are illegal aliens indicating that more than 25 percent of the federal prison population came to the U.S. illegally. Only about 10 percent of the incarcerated population is in federal custody with the remaining 90 percent in state and local custody.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
