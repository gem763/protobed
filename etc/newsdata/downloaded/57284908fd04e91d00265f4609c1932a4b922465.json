The last time the House of Commons convened on a Saturday was after Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982.\n\nWhy will they sit?\n\nThere is a European summit on the evening of Thursday 17, at which European leaders will consider their next steps in the Brexit saga.\n\nOn Friday it was announced that Brexit negotiations were intensifying or entering \u201cthe tunnel\u201d. That is, a period of intense negotiation in which there is no discussion with or leaking to the press.\n\nWhile the two sides remain far apart, the intensification of negotiations means the possibility of a deal is still alive.", "description": "Parliament is expected to sit on Saturday, October 19 in what could be one of the most important Commons\u2019 sessions of the entire Brexit process.", "authors": ["Daniel Capurro", "Liam Halligan", "Sajid Javid", "Allister Heath", "Sherelle Jacobs", "Stephen Bush"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2019/10/02/TELEMMGLPICT000211760890-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
