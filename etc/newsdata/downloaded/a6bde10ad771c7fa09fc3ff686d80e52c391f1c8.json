Sondland, whose companies donated at least $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, had agreed to appear voluntarily. House Democrats said they would subpoena the ambassador for both his testimony and documents.\n\nLuskin said Sondland \u201cbelieves strongly that he acted at all times in the best interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump is joined by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, second from right, as he arrives at Melsbroek Air Base in Brussels in 2018.

The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u2019\u201d the president wrote on Twitter. \u201cThat says it ALL!\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The House intelligence committee chairman told reporters that the ambassador to the EU had turned text messages or emails \u201cdeeply relevant\u201d to the investigation over to the State Department, but that the State Department is refusing to provide those to Congress.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/S7RoNY5vyHpdEBEeqY6vbg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/94df8650-e9da-11e9-9e6c-a8a5678c6f71", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
