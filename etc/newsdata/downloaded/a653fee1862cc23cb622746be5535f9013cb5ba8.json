We had a glass of champagne afterwards as well!' said Bruce.\n\n'He (Morgan) then rang me at midnight and said, 'I've changed my mind, Terry Connor has galvanised the training ground'. I was going to see him the next day and I thought everything was done. But they gave it to Mick's assistant.'\n\nAnd Bruce was also in the running to take over at Molineux in the summer of 2016, shortly before the arrival of current owners Fosun International.\n\n'I went to meet them in London,' said Bruce. 'I was out of work at the time, it was before Villa. They gave it to Walter Zenga.\n\n'At the time it was attractive. They were in the Championship and the new Chinese people were just taking over. It's amazing the opportunities and twists and turns in my game, in management.\n\n'If somebody had said to me six months ago I would be sitting here as manager of Newcastle then I wouldn't think that would be possible either. It's one of them, things that might have been.'", "description": "Steve Bruce has revealed that he shook hands on taking charge of Wolves in 2012 and even toasted the move with his wife before the club changed their mind in a midnight phone call.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/22/20226768-0-image-a-25_1572125176702.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
