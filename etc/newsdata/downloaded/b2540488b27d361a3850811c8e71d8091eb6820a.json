I was just happy to get away with that one!\n\n\u201cBut saying that, I didn\u2019t think the first one deserved a yellow, so maybe it evened itself out.\u201d\n\nBale\u2019s second yellow card of Euro 2020 qualifying means another booking would see him suspended.\n\nWales, who trail Group E leaders Croatia by six points and are three adrift of second-placed Slovakia, with a game in hand on both, finish their campaign with November games against Azerbaijan and Hungary.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t make too many silly tackles, I have to be mindful of that,\u201d Bale said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to miss any games for Wales, especially at the crunch time of the group.\n\n\u201cSo I have to be clever with what I\u2019m doing, but maybe expect someone\u2019s going to rile me to get me suspended.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m experienced enough to get through the period without picking up another booking.\u201d\n\nWales have failed to win in five previous encounters with Croatia and Bale would love to end that run against his Real team-mate Luka Modric.\n\n\u201cWe know each quite well, as we\u2019ve played together for a long time in Tottenham and Real Madrid, and it would be nice to get one over on him finally,\u201d Bale said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not spoken yet, maybe there will be a little message later on.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve beaten us a few times in the past, but it\u2019s always been a tight game between us.\n\n\u201cWe know what a great team they are. They had a great World Cup and shown year after year how good they are.\n\n\u201cBut playing at home gives us an advantage and we\u2019ve had some great results against some big teams in our stadium.\u201d\n\nWales will make a late decision on Aaron Ramsey\u2019s fitness after the Juventus midfielder, who is yet to feature in the Euro 2020 qualifying campaign, missed the Slovakia game while he recovers from a thigh problem.\n\n\u201cWe have not ruled Aaron out. He\u2019s on a different schedule, he didn\u2019t travel to Slovakia with the team and stayed back with the physio,\u201d Wales manager Ryan Giggs said.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re just giving him all the time we can and (will) see how is in the morning (on Sunday).\u201d", "description": "Cardiff (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 Wales star Gareth Bale admitted he is relieved to be available to face Croatia in Sunday\u2019s crucial Euro 2020", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/68064b_wales-gareth-bale-admits-he-was-lucky-avoid-red-card-slovakia-wales-star-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
