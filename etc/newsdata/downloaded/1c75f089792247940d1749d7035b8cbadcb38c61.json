The document, obtained by Al Jazeera, states that the order was issued after Christian leaders failed to attend a meeting called by the group.\n\nIn response, the group says in the letter that Christians must either convert to Islam, pay a tax on non-Muslims known as jiziya, or give up their posessions and leave the city. Failure to do so would result in a death penalty, \"as a last resort\".\n\nMosul, Iraq's second largest city, was overrun by the Islamic State group and allied rebel groups last month.\n\nThe Iraqi army units stationed in the city, most of whom were Shia, fled after the group crossed from Syria and attacked the north of Iraq.\n\nBefore the attack, Mosul's Christian community was estimated at 3,000. Many are believed to have already fled the city as part of an exodus of up to one-third of the population. Those who fled reported that churches and Christian-owned shops in the city were smashed.\n\nThe Islamic State's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, held a sermon in Mosul's grand mosque two weeks ago, calling on all Muslims to unite behind his group.\n\nThe Islamic State, formerly known as ISIL, has issued similar demands in areas it control in Syria, and has posted pictures of Christians being crucified for disobeying orders in Raqqa.\n\nChurch leader\u200es in Iraq have not responded to the threats officially.\n\nNickolay Mladenov, the head of the UN assistance mission In Iraq, condemned the order.\n\n\"Any persecution of minorities constitutes a crime against humanity and we urge all sides to protect civilians. We have produced a report listing attacks on civilians \u200eand have brought this up at the highest levels of the Iraqi government.\"", "description": "Islamic State group tells Christian community in Mosul they face death if they do not embrace Islam or pay tax.", "authors": ["Imran Khan"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/7/9//20147991923724734_20.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-02"}
