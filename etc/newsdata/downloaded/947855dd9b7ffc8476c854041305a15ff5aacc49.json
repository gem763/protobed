(Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images)\n\nThrough their analytical advancements and organizational changes, the Baltimore Orioles have worked to mimic the Houston Astros as they embarked on a full-scale rebuild to make the major league team a consistent winner. But Baltimore won\u2019t be able to match the three straight No. 1 overall draft picks Houston had earlier this decade.\n\n[Box score: Blue Jays 3, Orioles 2]\n\nWednesday\u2019s 3-2 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays ensured the Orioles (52-107) will have the second selection in the 2020 amateur draft. A season after taking Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman with the franchise\u2019s first No. 1 overall pick in 30 years, they will pick behind the Detroit Tigers, whose 46-111 disaster proved uncatchable. (The Miami Marlins and Orioles can both finish 55-107, but the Orioles would win the tiebreaker because they had a worse record in 2018.)\n\nAlthough it\u2019s easy to draw a clear line between the Astros\u2019 three consecutive No. 1 overall picks from 2012 to 2014 and the franchise\u2019s recent success, only one of those top picks has reached the majors, while their No. 2 overall pick in 2015 has been perhaps more impactful.\n\nWith Orioles General Manager Mike Elias then working for them in an advisory role, the Astros took shortstop Carlos Correa first in 2012, but their next two No. 1 selections, both of which came with Elias as scouting director, weren\u2019t so fruitful. Stanford right-hander Mark Appel, the 2013 top pick, was included in a trade with the Philadelphia Phillies for reliever Ken Giles and retired before reaching the majors.\n\nGiles, since traded to Toronto, finished off the Blue Jays\u2019 victory Wednesday with a scoreless ninth. Billy McKinney hit a leadoff home run off Gabriel Ynoa, whom Rowdy Tellez also took deep in the fourth before homering off Paul Fry in the sixth. After scoring 21 runs in the series\u2019 first two games, the Orioles failed to score until the eighth, when Rio Ruiz\u2019s RBI groundout and DJ Stewart\u2019s bases-loaded walk plated runs before a flyout by Chris Davis left the bases full.\n\nThe 2014 draft\u2019s No. 1 selection, prep left-hander Brady Aiken, didn\u2019t sign with Houston because of a medical issue. Not signing Aiken gave the Astros the second overall pick in 2015, with which they selected LSU shortstop Alex Bregman. This season, Bregman has hit 40 home runs for a Houston team that locked up a third straight division title and is pursuing a second World Series championship in three years.\n\nBregman, drafted three years and one pick behind Correa, has surpassed his fellow Astros infielder in FanGraphs Wins Above Replacement (19.9 vs. 18.4).", "description": "Baltimore will pick behind Detroit as it continues a full-scale rebuild.", "authors": ["Nathan Ruiz"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_TmloCOxRrehOYqqg9PZ7DJ0tqo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V2V4VXXABUI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg"}
