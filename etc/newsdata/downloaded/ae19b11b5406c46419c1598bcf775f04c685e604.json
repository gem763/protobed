A team source said Mayock \"walked away because he saw it escalate\" while other players held Brown back.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter reported the team plans to suspend the star receiver.\n\nIan Rapoport of NFL Network added that the confrontation didn't get physical, but Brown threatened to hit Mayock in the face before punting a football.\n\nThis incident came after Brown complained about a $13,950 fine on Instagram on Wednesday for missing a team walkthrough Aug. 22 ahead of a preseason game against the Green Bay Packers in Winnipeg, Manitoba:\n\nThe receiver missed a practice Aug. 18 after filing a grievance with the NFL over a helmet issue, leading to a $40,000 team fine. Mayock was unhappy with the situation when discussing it with the media at the time.\n\n\"From our perspective, it's time for him to be all-in or all-out,\" he said.\n\nBrown had also missed time at training camp because of a foot injury caused by misuse of a cryotherapy machine.\n\nThough the Raiders haven't announced any discipline, the seven-time Pro Bowler was not at practice Thursday.\n\nIf the organization decides to suspend him for conduct detrimental to the team, it could release him without paying the $29.125 million guaranteed in his contract and a $1 million signing bonus, according to Mike Tannenbaum of ESPN.", "description": "Oakland Raiders  wide receiver  Antonio Brown  reportedly began and escalated Wednesday's altercation with general manager  Mike Mayock ...", "authors": ["Rob Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/826/866/hi-res-f43d4d6bee2340d7c2f3a84a68d8fe2a_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
