(Photo: Darren Hauck / Getty)\n\nOn Monday, the FBI released its latest \u201cCrime in the United States\u201d figures, a closely watched (albeit historically problematic) data set that relies on the voluntary reporting of thousands of law enforcement agencies across the country.\n\nThroughout the week, many Americans are likely to hear about how the violent crime rate has \u201cfallen for the second year\u201d in a row. If he hasn\u2019t already, Trump will probably post a tweet soon taking credit for the statistical decline. TV pundits who favour the administration\u2019s tough immigration stance will probably tout the figures as proof that its policies are working.\n\nWhat will largely go unsaid is that the FBI\u2019s figures have long suffered from inaccuracies stemming not only from its flawed collection process but also its internal methodology. Here\u2019s one hypothetical The Conversation offered last year to demonstrate how data on \u201cserious\u201d offences can be easily distorted:\n\nTake this example. You live in a nice neighbourhood with a Kmart on the edge of it. \u201cSerious\u201d crime includes all the shoplifting from the Kmart; let\u2019s say 150 incidents in a year. It also includes all the murders and rapes; call it 20 incidents in a year. The Kmart closes. All of a sudden, your crime rate has gone from 170 to 20: an 88 per cent decrease in crime.\n\nHowever, the FBI also offers data that focuses entirely on \u201cviolent crime.\u201d This year\u2019s figures show is that in 2018, there were an estimated 1,206,836 violent crimes \u2014 a 3.9 per cent drop from the previous year. (Violent crimes are limited to murder and non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.)\n\nMost violent crimes go unreported and, thus, are not included in the FBI\u2019s data. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), which conducts surveys of crime victims ages 12 and older for the U.S. Justice Department, found that as of 2017 only 45 per cent of the violent crimes tracked by the agency were reported to police. That same year, only one-third, or 36 per cent, of property crimes got reported. The FBI\u2019s latest figures claim property crime is down 6.3 per cent. (You can read about BJS\u2019s methodology here.)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on some troubling errors found in last year\u2019s \u201cCrime in the United States\u201d related to the \u201ccrude estimates\u201d FBI uses to compensate for missing data:\n\nIn its latest report, the FBI didn\u2019t adjust the counts of violent crime for 11 states at all. But it inflated Indiana\u2019s numbers by 9.9 per cent, West Virginia\u2019s by 13 per cent and Mississippi\u2019s by 68 per cent, raising that state\u2019s count to an estimated 8,526, up from a reported 5,084.\n\nHomicide figures also had to be adjusted due to missing data, though that apparently didn\u2019t happen for every U.S. state. Sometimes, the estimates used by FBI to fill in the gaps \u201cstray substantially from reported numbers,\u201d according to the Journal:\n\nThe numbers for 28 states were not adjusted, but Mississippi\u2019s count, the worst of the bunch, was increased by 56 per cent, to an estimated 245 murders from a reported 157.\n\nFor an idea of how often the FBI was forced to rely on estimations in its new report, nearly 2,000 \u2014 or 10.3 per cent \u2014 of the country's 18,586 law enforcement agencies did not share data with the bureau.\n\nThe FBI figures released today also show that while violent crime is purportedly down, the number of rapes reported has jumped by 2.7 per cent. But just as it would be ill-advised to assume that \u201cviolent crime has dropped\u201d based on the FBI\u2019s data, it\u2019s also tricky to suggest the rate of rape is going up.\n\nAs with many other types of crimes, the figures are entirely based on the number of victims who come forward, explaining why FBI\u2019s homicide figures are generally considered the most reliable. The U.S. Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network estimates that roughly three out of four sexual assaults go unreported.\n\nHowever, BJS\u2019s latest report does support the conclusion that there\u2019s been an increase in rape and sexual assault since 2017: \u201c[T]he rate of rape or sexual-assault victimization increased from 1.4 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older in 2017 to 2.7 in 2018,\u201d it says. This is a significant spike from recent years. (Between 2014 and 2017, the highest figure reported, in 2015, was 1.6 per 1,000 persons age 12 or older.)\n\nThe FBI has only been including statistics on male rape victims since 2013. It previously reported only what it called \u201cforcible rape,\u201d i.e., \u201ccarnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will.\u201d Its new definition includes \u201cpenetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\u201d The statistics notably exclude charges of incest and what the law considers \u201cstatutory rape,\u201d which may significantly skew the totals.\n\nAccording to the FBI, an estimated 10.3 million arrests were made in 2018, including for traffic violations.\n\nIf you or anyone you know is a victim of sexual assault, contact 1800RESPECT, Australia's national sexual assault, domestic violence and family violence counselling hotline.", "description": "On Monday, the FBI released its latest \u201cCrime in the United States\u201d figures, a closely watched (albeit historically problematic) data set that relies on the voluntary reporting of thousands of law enforcement agencies across the country....", "authors": ["David Tracy", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/iq7pf9zwftxw79kpq3mg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
