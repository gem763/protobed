Food Stylist: Barrett Washburne.\n\nTry starting with sweet ingredients like apple and sweet potato, as babies take to them more easily than sour or bitter ones. During those first few weeks of solid foods, little ones will eat only a few tablespoons of the pur\u00e9es to supplement their breast milk or formula feedings. They may not like them at first, but introduce each pur\u00e9e over a few feedings until they adapt. As they grow, they will graduate to larger servings: 2 ounces, 4 ounces and more.\n\nFruit Pur\u00e9es Apple: Applesauce at its smoothest, this recipe is a great first solid to give to your baby. You can treat pears, apricots and nectarines the same way. In a small saucepan, bring \u00bd cup purified water to a boil. Add 1 peeled, cored and cubed apple and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Transfer to a blender, add \u00bc cup purified water and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Let cool and serve at room temperature or freeze for later use. Makes 1 cup. As your baby grows older, you can make this sauce chunkier and add dried spices like turmeric, ginger and cinnamon to taste. Prune: Babies get constipated. Prunes can help get their still-developing digestive systems moving, especially as they try new, unfamiliar foods. In a small saucepan, bring \u00bd cup purified water and 8 pitted prunes to a boil. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Let cool. Transfer to a blender and pur\u00e9e until it reaches desired consistency. Let cool and serve at room temperature or freeze for later use. Makes \u00bd cup.\n\nVegetable Pur\u00e9es Sweet Potato: Sweet potatoes are a wonderful first vegetable for baby, as they can be made sweet or savory. You can also swap in zucchini, squash, beets or pumpkin in this recipe. Roast them as you would for yourself, but discard skins, and keep in mind that these vegetables may roast in less time. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. On a rimmed baking sheet, roast a sweet potato until tender, 40 to 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Cut in half and scoop out flesh. Place it in a blender with 4 ounces formula or breast milk and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Let cool and serve at room temperature or freeze for later use. Makes about 1\u00bc cups. Here, as with the apple pur\u00e9e, you can add dried spices like turmeric, ginger and cinnamon to taste as your baby gets older. Broccoli: Use this technique for other vegetables that you like steamed, too, like cauliflower, carrots or peas. With a paring knife, cut off and discard the tough stalks of a \u00bd-pound head of broccoli and divide into small florets. Place broccoli in a steamer basket over a large saucepan with a thin layer of boiling water. Steam, covered, for 6 to 7 minutes, until tender. Remove broccoli from steamer and let cool. Place broccoli in a blender with 6 ounces formula or breast milk, and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Let cool and serve at room temperature or freeze for later use. Makes about 1\u00bd cups.", "description": "With so many important firsts in a baby\u2019s life, it\u2019s easy to forget one of the most rewarding: baby\u2019s first solid food.
