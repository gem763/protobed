There are fun ones like the giant Converse sneaker shoulder bag. Other pieces drip with kitschy nostalgia like a pocketbook stamped with the Hess Brothers department-store logo.\n\nHowever, the real heart-stoppers are Wood\u2019s designer babies. Fashion\u2019s marquee names are all represented: Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Moschino. She has Judith Leiber minaudi\u00e8res, Edie Parker clutches, and Louis Vuitton satchels. We are talking scores of Kellys and Birkins.\n\nThere are the rare Anne Marie of Paris\u2019 sculptural darlings - of which she has 19.\n\nWood\u2019s most expensive acquisition: a flaming-red, 40-centimeter crocodile Kelly that she estimates to be worth at least $100,000.\n\nWood keeps most of her bags in an impenetrable, stainless steel bunker outfitted with electronic doors and alarms. Wood ordered the bunker online seven years ago from the Army. Half of the space - two Jaguars reside on the other side - is filled with sealed 18-gallon plastic storage bins stacked on top of each other that are overflowing with bags. The bins are organized thematically, with descriptive labels like \u201cwooden top handle,\u201d \u201dleather shoulder bags,\u201d and \u201cevening bags\u201d neatly taped to the outside. Beauts that cost thousands of dollars live next to those that might have cost $10 or less.\n\n\u201cI collect handbags on every level,\u201d Wood, 64, said. \u201cNot everyone can spend on handbags what it costs to buy a car or a house and I get it\u2026 My collection is about the democratization of fashion.\u201d\n\nThe Historic Bethlehem Museums and Sites exhibition \u201cPURSEonality: A Stylish Handbag History\u201d at three Lehigh Valley museums stars hundreds of handbags from Wood\u2019s collection. Ultimately Wood wants to open her own handbag museum, and she hopes \u201cPURSEonality,\u201d which will run through April 30, is the first step. This is the first show dedicated to Wood\u2019s massive collection.\n\nThe Kemerer Museum of Decorative Arts will feature 300 of them, including Wood\u2019s oldest (a Victorian-era carpetbag), the most unusual (a 1960s Lucite evening by Hollywood designer O.E.L. Graves) and the most valuable (the hot Kelly). Also included in the Kemerer exhibit are Wood\u2019s straight-off-the-runway pieces and their Chinatown knock-off counterparts. One hundred needlepoint bags will be placed in the Moravian Museum of Bethlehem. And 150 handbags that pay homage to travel - including one fashioned from a taxi cab light - will be at Allentown\u2019s America on Wheels Museum.\n\nIndustry insiders say Wood\u2019s stash is quite possibly the largest private collection of handbags in the world. The largest public one boasts over 5,000 and resides at the Handbag Museum of Bags and Purses in Amsterdam.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything that comes close to it in size and quality,\u201d said Karen Giberson, president and CEO of the Accessories Council. Giberson hosted a cocktail party for Wood at New York\u2019s LIM College of Fashion last month to introduce Wood to the New York handbag elite. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the largest collection I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nA bygone era\n\nHandbags are among the most powerful women\u2019s accessories. \u201cThey are statement-makers,\u201d Giberson said. \u201cIt is both functional as it holds all of our necessities, treasures, and secrets.\u201d\n\nWhat we carry varies according to who we are at that moment. Some carry our lives in our handbags, so we tote around ones that are big and durable. Others are minimalists and a tiny shoulder bag will do. Maybe we\u2019re the girl who changes her bag every day. Or perhaps we carry the same purse until it falls apart. There are those of us who can afford a Chanel and want the world to know, and there are those of us who can afford a Chanel but still carry the Target special. And then there are those of us who can\u2019t afford Chanel at all.\n\nThe bottom line is, women make a choice every day. It\u2019s not \u201cTo carry or not to carry?\u201d but \u201cWhat to carry?\u201d\n\nWood made her first choice when she was 9 when her mother presented her with two: one was a sad brown vinyl, the other a red leather Bonnie Cashin. (In 1961 Cashin became Coach\u2019s first designer.)\n\nWood chose the red bag.\n\n\u201cAnd when my mother asked me why, I told her that red was a great color and it goes with everything and it makes an outfit pop and it looks special and it\u2019s very unique,\u201d said Wood. Even back then, she spoke fluent fashionese. \u201cI passed the test.\u201d\n\nWhile studying at Cornell, Wood carried a Coach. She graduated in 1976 with a degree in design, joined the buyer training squad at the now-defunct Abraham & Straus department store and moved to Greenwich Village. With her big Joyce DeWitt eyes and cascading Cher hair, she was a poster girl for all that was glam-mod chic. She was six degrees of separation from all that was go-go-boot cool: She shopped at the same boutique as pre-fame Cyndi Lauper and Betsey Johnson lived next door.\n\nHer taste in handbags became even more eclectic - think tassels and disco sparkle.\n\nAt 25, while working as the fashion director at Ormond Shops, she met Irwin Hochberg, who was almost 50, and the owner of a company that sold store furnishings and display equipment to the largest department stores in the world. They married and moved to west Allentown, settling into Max Hess\u2019 mansion.\n\nThat\u2019s when her handbags leveled up.\n\nEvery time her husband traveled to Europe on department-store business, he\u2019d bring back a fancy European handbag. Sometimes, she\u2019d tag along. During a trip to London in the 1980s, Wood spotted a navy blue matte crocodile Birkin behind a glass vitrine in Harrods.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been looking for that exact bag for a while, so I went insane,\u201d Wood said. \u201cI went over to the clerk and asked her if it was for sale. When she said yes, I bought it on the spot. I probably paid about $4,000 or $5,000 for it then. That bag is probably worth about $60,000 or $70,000 now. I didn\u2019t know it then, but I was making savvy investments.\u201d\n\nCollecting to cope\n\nWood is a haute hoarder in the best sense of the word. She doesn\u2019t just collect handbags, but art and books and other kitsch.\n\nBut handbags, since her mother handed her the red Bonnie Cashin, are her passion.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Hochberg\u2019s heart began to fail and Wood found some solace in retail therapy and bought handbags. Hochberg died in 2003.\n\nIn 2006, she married Bob Wood, an Allentown A-lister. They were married for six years before she found herself caring for yet another dying husband. This time sitting by another hospital bed, she bought handbags online to pass the time.\n\n\u201cI was mentally detaching myself,\u201d Wood said. \u201cBut then I got to the point where I wasn\u2019t collecting for me anymore, I was collecting for posterity. I realized I was saving bags from the landfill. I was becoming attuned to how fashion fits into women\u2019s history. They were cultural artifacts that weren\u2019t being preserved.\u201d\n\nBob died in 2011 and Wood grieved, researched, and collected.\n\nNot only would she buy the crocodile Birkin for a few thousand dollars, she\u2019d buy the crocodile bag shaped like a Birkin for a few hundred and the knockoff fashioned from pleather covered with the fake logo for $20 or $30. In the cases where she has both the real bag and its reasonable facsimile, she\u2019ll carry the fake.\n\nA library of bags\n\nMention a designer or a certain style to Wood, and she will make a beeline to the exact bin in her Army bunker.\n\nWood\u2019s favorite bags, however, live in her library tucked between her books that include her 1987 New York Times best seller Catmopolitan, a parody Cosmo featuring felines, written when she was still Ilene Hochberg.\n\nThere are Edie Parker clutches with \u201cIlene\u201d inscribed in the brand\u2019s hallmark script. There is a Moschino made to look like Oscar the Grouch\u2019s home, bags shaped like water bottles, and some with giant safety pins as handles. In the corner is a Patricia Nash for QVC carpetbag like the one Emily Blunt carried when she starred in 2018\u2019s Mary Poppins Returns. And from this handbag bounty, Wood produces a leather overnight case designed by Mark Cross made around the time Grace Kelly famously carried one just like it in Rear Window.\n\n\u201cThere is so much to choose from,\u201d said Lindsey Jancay, director of collections and programming at Historic Bethlehem Museum & Sites who is curating the exhibits. \u201cEvery time I come here I see something I didn\u2019t see before and that makes the choices for the show all the more tougher to make. There is so much history here.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2Vkm7Ub\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Philadelphia Inquirer, http://www.inquirer.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ilene Hochberg Wood's collection of 3,000 handbags - the majority of which dwell in a 2,400-square-foot Quonset hut on her Lehigh Valley estate - will make a fashionista fall to her knees.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Elizabeth Wellington", "The Philadelphia Inquirer"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/exchange-handbag_collection_43076_c0-114-2750-1718_s1200x700.jpg?ff3bdb6eab32ea57ee064ff9d20928e2c9b4a521", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
