Diana Belbita via unanimous decision (30-26, 30-26, 30-26)\n\nUpdated records: McCann (10-2 MMA, 3-1 UFC), Belbita (11-5 MMA, 0-1 UFC)\n\nKey stat: McCann\u2019s three-fight UFC winning streak in women\u2019s flyweight competition is tied for the second longest active streak in the division behind Valentina Shevchenko (four).\n\nMcCann on fighting through illness\n\n\u201cI felt a little sick. My attributes and game plan require a massive engine and gas tank, and I couldn\u2019t give anything because I felt like I was going to be sick. So to come away with winning three rounds with an average performance is not good enough for me. But I\u2019m not complaining. I\u2019ve won again \u2013 I just wish it was more spectacular because I know how good I am. I feel like I\u2019ve earned more than just another debuting prospect, but thank God \u2013 that\u2019s all I had tonight with the way my body was feeling.\u201d\n\nMcCann on disappointment with performance\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be happy when I look back, but I\u2019m devastated right now. I want to get back in there and do another three rounds to fix it. The cut, the training camp, everything was perfect \u2013 so it\u2019s on me. I just felt weird out there with my belly. I couldn\u2019t get going. My lungs weren\u2019t tired, but my body was just shutting down. At least on my worst day, I still produced a performance that got me a win.\u201d\n\nMcCann on what she wants next\n\n\u201cIf they give me another chance before the end of the year, I\u2019ll jump all over it.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from McCann, check out the video of the full post-fight interview above.\n\nGallery Molly McCann def.
