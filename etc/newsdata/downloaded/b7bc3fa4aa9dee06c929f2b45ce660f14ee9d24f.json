While most Americans consider open inquiry and academic freedom essential to the mission of a university, the debate over what can or cannot be said on campus is far from settled at most schools today.\n\nHow serious is the speech problem in higher education? Is the problem widespread or just relegated to a small group of campuses? Which colleges and universities are doing a good job of protecting speech? RealClearEducation conducted a survey of experts on the campus speech climate in order to explore these questions.\n\nAbout This Survey\n\nThis survey is designed to show how schools stack up in the opinions of experts who are concerned about free speech on campus. It\u2019s a small sample of opinions and is not, to be clear, a scientific poll. If you look closely at our survey respondents, it\u2019s evident that conservatives outnumber liberals. We originally invited 70 academics, pundits, and policy experts to participate. About half were recognizably on the left end of the political spectrum. Some of them accepted. Panelists such as Jonathan Haidt, Gregory Lukianoff, and Jeffrey A. Sachs, for instance, are certainly not political conservatives.\n\nNevertheless, a majority of the 22 invitees who ultimately completed our survey are recognizably on the right side of the political spectrum. This imbalance is itself instructive. A recent Pew Research Center study showed that Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to be worried about professors bringing their political and social views into the classroom (79% to 17%). Republicans are also far more likely than Democrats to believe that colleges are too concerned with protecting students from views they might find offensive (75% to 31%). The greater number of conservatives who agreed to participate in our panel reflects the greater concern conservatives have about campus speech. There are several identifiable libertarians on our panel as well.\n\nThere is an obvious reason for the special concern about the campus speech climate among conservatives. They are often outnumbered and underrepresented among the faculty and administration, particularly at elite schools. However, political liberals are increasingly raising concerns about censure on campus as well. On the other hand, there are those who say the entire notion of a campus speech crisis is overblown.\n\nTo gain more insight into this issue, we asked our panelists for their opinions on which U.S. colleges and universities have the best climate for free speech, viewpoint diversity, and open inquiry. We also asked them to tell us which schools they think have the most room for improvement in these areas. Finally, we asked panelists to share their thoughts on how free speech, viewpoint diversity, and open inquiry relate to the proper mission of a university.

Panelists were asked to name up to five schools that serve as positive role models in the areas of free speech, viewpoint diversity, and open inquiry.\n\nUniversity of Chicago - Best school with respect to campus speech climate according to RealClear's 2019 survey of campus speech experts. (RealClearEducation)\n\n\u2022 The University of Chicago was the clear winner for best speech climate, according to our survey. With its famous \u201cChicago Statement\u201d guaranteeing students and faculty broad latitude for speech and strong protection of academic freedom, the vast majority of our panelists chose the University of Chicago as one of their top five picks.\n\n\u2022 Next were Purdue University, Princeton University, the University of Virginia, Arizona State University, and Claremont McKenna College. These schools stood out to our panelists as positive role models with respect to campus speech climate.\n\nSchools That Need Improvement\n\nPanelists were also asked to name up to five schools that have the most need for improvement in the areas of free speech, viewpoint diversity, and open inquiry.\n\n\u2022 Yale University was the one most frequently identified by our panelists. High-profile controversies related to free speech and academic freedom, including the ouster of a professor from his position as a college master, the contentious renaming of a residential building, and the removal or destruction of controversial artwork on campus likely contributed to Yale\u2019s troubled reputation among our respondents.\n\n\u2022 Yale was followed by Harvard University, Williams College, Oberlin College, Liberty University, DePaul University, and Brown University among schools identified most often by our panelists as in need of improvement with respect to campus speech climate.\n\nAnalysis of Survey Results\n\nOur panelists include professors, journalists, lawyers, and scholars who work in the areas of higher education or First Amendment law and policy. They come from a wide range of educational and ideological backgrounds. Nevertheless, our results show some consensus. For instance, there is no question that the University of Chicago is seen as a leader in the area of free speech on campus. In this survey, we wanted to focus attention on those schools that are getting it right, not just those that are getting it wrong.\n\nHowever, our survey also reveals some disagreement as to which schools are doing a good job or a poor job of protecting speech. The University of California, Berkeley, for instance, received an equal number of negative and positive votes \u2014 perhaps revealing competing conceptions about what actually constitutes a good speech climate. Thus, our survey shows that views of a school\u2019s campus speech climate can be subjective, based on one\u2019s ideology and background.\n\nIt is hard to draw much of a conclusion about any school that received merely one or two votes in either the \u201crole model\u201d or \u201cneeds improvement\u201d category. For those schools that received a larger share of votes, it\u2019s likely that they have gained something of a reputation \u2014 either positive or negative \u2014 with respect to speech climate. Our goal was simply to provide a qualitative look at the reputations of schools in the eyes of our panelists, who spend a lot of time working in or thinking about these institutions.\n\nOur Panel of Experts on Campus Speech\n\nJonathan Haidt \u2013 professor, New York University\n\nGregory Lukianoff \u2013 president, Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE)\n\nCharles Murray \u2013 scholar, American Enterprise Institute\n\nDebra Mashek \u2013 executive director, Heterodox Academy\n\nRobert P.

We asked them to choose between the following two prompts: How do you believe free speech and open inquiry relate to the proper mission of a university? Or, how has viewpoint diversity (or lack thereof) impacted your own education or career? Here are their responses:\n\nBest schools with respect to speech climate. Best schools with respect to speech climate.\n\nJonathan Haidt \u00ad\u2013 professor, NYU\n\n\u201cBecause of a lack of viewpoint diversity, policies are implemented to promote ends that are sometimes antithetical to free inquiry and the Socratic spirit. For example, at my university we have a \u2018bias response line.\u2019 Students are encouraged to anonymously report anyone who says anything that offends them. So, as a professor, I no longer take risks; I must teach to the most easily offended student in the class. I therefore avoid saying or doing anything provocative. My classes are less fun and engaging.\u201d\n\nGregory Lukianoff \u00ad\u2013 president, FIRE\n\n\u201cPerhaps the most profound way a lack of viewpoint diversity harms campus free speech is that now decades of college students have come to see the First Amendment and/or freedom of speech primarily as that excuse used by people in power to not have to punish the insensitive, wrongheaded, or offensive. Whereas in a democracy the majority gets to make the rules, and protections of free speech exist almost exclusively to protect the rights of minorities, students\u2019 views have been entirely reversed. Campus activists have come to think of power as something that can be counted on to be on their side, so they want campus administrators to be free to stop speech they see as harmful or hurtful. This is how you end up with campus activists believing that free speech is something that exists to protect the powerful. They, somewhat irrationally, still see themselves as the underdog, but power is overwhelmingly on their side and therefore they do not see how a lack of free speech would harm them if they were genuinely a disfavored minority on or off campus.\u201d\n\nCharles Murray \u00ad\u2013 scholar, AEI\n\n\u201cThe telos of the university is truth. It cannot have a second telos. There is no such thing as a university that fully supports the search for truth and also pursues a social-justice agenda, for example \u2014 or, for that matter, also pursues a limited-government agenda.\u201d\n\nWorst schools with respect to campus speech climate.\n\nDebra Mashek \u2013 executive director, Heterodox Academy\n\n\u201cThe university exists to create and disseminate knowledge. Those core functions can't be realized if people are unable to ask questions, to share ideas, or to interrogate all claims.\u201d\n\nRobert P. George \u2013 professor, Princeton University\n\n\u201cFreedom of thought and speech are the oxygen of the life of the mind.\u201d\n\nRobby Soave \u2013 associate editor, Reason\n\n\u201cStudents and professors must be free to question long-held truths, and to risk provoking and offending the adherents of those truths, for the university to function.\u201d\n\nHeather Mac Donald \u00ad\u2013 fellow, The Manhattan Institute\n\n\u201cThe core mission of a university is to pass on our cultural inheritance from one generation to the next. There is a vast body of knowledge \u2014 of history, literature, art, the foundations of science, and the constitutional traditions that have lessened the threat of arbitrary, tyrannical power \u2014 that students lack and that universities should feel an urgent necessity to provide. Free speech and open inquiry can aid in that mission by allowing received errors about the past and present to be corrected. But to put free speech and open inquiry at the heart of a university's mission risks distracting attention away from the fact that students are graduating from college with their ignorance largely intact, and risks portraying the university as a debating society rather than the place where the past is curated and preserved.\u201d\n\nJeffrey A. Sachs \u2013 lecturer, Acadia University\n\n\u201cFree speech is rightly viewed as essential to university life, but free speech alone is not enough. The reality is that we can neither teach nor learn in a space where \u2018anything goes,\u2019 making it essential that we strike a balance between free speech and inclusion. Colleges and universities have made enormous strides in just the last few years and we should not be afraid to acknowledge their accomplishments.\u201d\n\nJennifer Kabbany \u2013 editor, The College Fix\n\n\u201cWhen students, and even many professors, are afraid to voice their unpopular opinions for fear that they will be attacked by a mob of social justice warriors or ostracized by their peers, then it is no longer a place of higher education, or academic inquiry, or stimulating debate \u2014 it is an Orwellian dead zone. Far too many scholars have abdicated their professional responsibility to teach the whole subject in favor of providing their narrow and biased narrative.\u201d\n\nKim Colby \u2013 attorney, Christian Legal Society\n\n\u201cFor nearly four decades, I have worked to keep religious student groups on college campuses in red, blue, and purple states. I never would have believed how entrenched hostility to religious student groups would be among college administrators. Religious students and their groups are a positive campus presence who should be welcomed by college administrators but instead are often threatened with exclusion from campus precisely because of their specific religious beliefs and speech. Such opposition makes no sense because religious student groups enhance both religious and ideological diversity on campus.\u201d\n\nJennifer L. Lambe \u2013 associate professor, University of Delaware\n\n\u201cIt is imperative for Universities to prepare students to interact with a diverse range of ideas and thoughts. Learning to have civil dialogue about contentious subjects with people who have different viewpoints is desperately needed. The human tendency to view the world as \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 is being heightened in our current media environment. As educators, we must engage students to consider why it is important to protect freedom of expression, perhaps especially for ideas we find deeply offensive. We must also make clear that freedom of speech and press mean that the government cannot easily restrict one's expression, but it does not mean that you are absolved of consequences and criticism of that expression.\u201d\n\nTyson Langhofer \u2013 director, Center for Academic Freedom at the Alliance Defending Freedom\n\n\u201cHumans are predisposed to be biased towards ideas that they find attractive, rather than relying solely upon hard facts. When an academic environment is intellectually uniform, important ideas or theories remain unexplored and widely held assumptions go unchallenged. In such an environment, research and studies can be corrupted or suppressed for the benefit of certain special interests. This in turn suppresses innovation, solvable problems remain unsolved, and intellectual growth is restricted. Most tragically, important truths remain unknown.\u201d\n\nCliff Maloney \u2013 president, Young Americans for Liberty\n\n\u201cThe fundamental purpose of higher education is to maximize the potential of those who will soon take their first steps into the outside world, carrying what they\u2019ve learned in the classroom and applying it to the advancement of society. This growth simply cannot take place, however, if students are routinely barred from hearing ideas to which they have yet to be exposed.\u201d\n\nGeoffrey R. Stone \u2013 professor, University of Chicago School of Law\n\n\u201cFree speech and open inquiry are essential to the mission of a university. The goal of a university is to seek the truth. The only way to do that is to encourage a wide diversity of views and to allow them to be tested critically and openly.\u201d\n\nJohn J. Miller \u2013 director, Dow Journalism program at Hillsdale College\n\n\u201cWhen I think about free speech and open inquiry on campus, I think of a line written by John Milton long ago: \u2018Where there is much desire to learn, there of necessity will be much arguing, much writing, many opinions; for opinion in good men is but knowledge in the making.\u2019\u201d\n\nWolf von Laer \u2013 CEO, Students for Liberty\n\n\u201cOne needs to be uncomfortable in order to grow. Universities need to be a place of respectful conversation that sometimes can be provocative. Progress can only come from challenging the status quo. This can only come about when people think and act differently than others. Free speech and peaceful \u2014 even if heated \u2014 exchanges are the foundation for this.\u201d\n\nMatt Lamb \u2013 national director, Students for Life\n\n\u201cThere is no point in having a university if you are not going to encourage students to debate issues and learn more about opposing viewpoints. I believe that the issues we see today with polarization and heated rhetoric in politics as well as the issues we have as a broader society discussing important issues is linked to the way students are treated by universities.\u201d\n\nNicole Neily \u2013 president, Speech First\n\n\u201cUniversities were created with the goal of pursuing truth, wherever that may lie. Unfortunately, by restricting and discouraging certain viewpoints, opinions, and ideas, they have hobbled themselves in this mission \u2014 and in turn, undermined their own legitimacy.\u201d\n\nClick here to download a full report on the 2019 Survey of Campus Speech Experts in PDF format.", "description": "How serious is the speech problem in higher education?
