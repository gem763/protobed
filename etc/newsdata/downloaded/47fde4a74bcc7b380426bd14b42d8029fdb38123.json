Instead of prosecuting Andrew Johnson for violating the Tenure of Office Act (a dubious ground for impeachment), the red, white and blue button voiced the widespread anger at Lyndon Johnson for his alleged treachery associated with his escalation of the war in Vietnam. Unlike his namesake, however, LBJ never had a fear of impeachment, in part because his transgressions seemed limited to bad judgment not criminal behavior.\n\nIt is important to remember that no president faced a serious threat of impeachment from 1789 until Andrew Johnson in 1868. Then, for over a century, the procedure lay unused against presidents until Richard Nixon faced almost certain impeachment and conviction over the Watergate scandal in 1974 before he resigned. Only months after Gerald Ford assumed the presidency, Democrats in Congress floated the possibility of impeaching him for cutting a deal with Nixon that traded resignation for a pardon. (This little-remembered effort is recounted in my book, The Class of \u201974.)\n\nA decade later, many Democrats contemplated filing impeachment resolutions again Ronald Reagan for his attempted efforts to cover-up knowledge of White House operatives circumventing congressional strictures against aiding the anti-Sandinista \u201ccontras\u201d in Nicaragua\u2019s civil war. Although aides were prosecuted, Reagan himself escaped, partly because many in Congress believed he was too confused to have orchestrated the deception.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust over a decade later, Bill Clinton actually was impeached \u2014 though not convicted \u2014 over allegations over his inappropriate personal behavior and his alleged prevarications during questioning. Neither charge against him received a majority vote in the Senate let alone the two-thirds required for conviction.\n\nLess than a decade after Clinton\u2019s trial, the new Democratic speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiTrump lashes out at 2020 Dems, impeachment inquiry In marathon testimony, Dems see an ambassador scorned, while GOP defends Trump Trump accuses Pelosi of 'hating' US over impeachment inquiry MORE, was pushed to launch an impeachment inquiry into whether George W. Bush had intentionally misled the Congress and the country about Iraq\u2019s alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction in order to galvanize the nation into beginning a seemingly endless war. Pelosi, focused on enacting her \u201c6 for \u201806\u201d legislative agenda, pushed back against the impeachment demands notwithstanding her own suspicions about Bush\u2019s mendacity and her fervent opposition to the war.\n\nNearly a decade and a half later, we again find ourselves in the midst of demands for the impeachment of a president. A process one rarely contemplated seemingly has become reflexively discussed. Indeed, some journalists were even speculating in April 2016 that Trump could face impeachment soon after being inaugurated \u2014 and he hadn\u2019t even been nominated yet!\n\nWhat explains that evolution? Are presidents more dishonest? Are Congresses more obsessed with finding wrongdoing? Or is there something more profound about the changing nature of American politics?\n\nIndeed, American politics have become far more polarized as parties ideologically realigned and the middle ground dramatically withered over the past 40 years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith the rise of partisanship has come a far greater level of equity \u2014 close margins of control \u2014 between the parties, with persistent competition for the control of Congress more closely resembling the quadrennial race for the White House. In the 62 years from 1932 to 1994, Democrats controlled the House for all but four years; in the modern political era, however, control of one house or another has shifted in 1980, 1986, 1994, 1996, 2010, 2014 and 2018, resulting in a heightened competitive fervor fed by unrestrained money and round-the-clock \u201cnews\u201d coverage often untethered from the facts.\n\nThe more frequent change in control of Congress has also meant a greater chance that the House will be controlled by the party other than that of the president, especially since off-year elections often serve the purpose of checking the power of the person in the White House. Indeed, every presidential impeachment has unsurprisingly come when the House and White House were under different party control.\n\nLastly have been the cultural changes, especially more rigid ideology and an expectation of immediate gratification, unwillingness to wait for the next election, and activist base groups that view election outcomes as little more than the starting point for investigations and challenges to winners.\n\nIn an earlier era like the 1960s, none of these factors existed, and so despite those clever \u201cImpeach Johnson\u201d buttons, there was little contemplation of impeaching a president.
