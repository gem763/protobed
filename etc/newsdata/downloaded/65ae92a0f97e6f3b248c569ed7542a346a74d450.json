He was understood to be in stable condition\n\nPolice said Sham was bleeding from his head and arms when officers found him. The suspects fled in a car which officers were pursuing, the force said. An investigation is under way.\n\nFellow rights front member Figo Chan said witnesses had told him onlookers tried to stop the ambush but Sham\u2019s attackers pointed a knife at them.\n\nCivil Human Rights Front vice convenor Figo Chan Ho-hang (L), and Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit (R), talk to the press at the Legco building in Tamar in September. Photo: SCMP / May Tse Sham had been making his way to the democracy group\u2019s annual general meeting, where he was expected to discuss a march from Tsim Sha Tsui to West Kowloon railway station set for Sunday.\n\nChan said the march would proceed as planned.\n\nThe rights front condemned the attack, saying it would have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on democracy advocates and fuel fears of \u201cwhite terror\u201d in Hong Kong.\n\nThe attack was not the first against Sham. He and his assistant Law Kwok-wai were in late August set upon by two people in masks wielding a baseball bat and a rod, hours after the pair were told by police that a rally they had planned for the following weekend had been banned.\n\nPolice later arrested three male suspects, including a 15-year-old boy. The youngster was charged with conspiracy to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and appeared at Kowloon City Juvenile Court. Two other suspects remain at large.\n\nDemocratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting said \u201cthe assault is clearly politically motivated\u201d. He accused police of failing to protect opposition politicians and activists. Lam said he had been assaulted by government supporters in June but that police had not made any arrests.\n\nNg Tak-nam, chief inspector of Mong Kok district, said the attackers, who were masked and were wearing black tops, assaulted Sham causing a 3cm (1.2-inch) wound on his forehead.\n\nNg condemned the violence and believed the crime was pre-planned, as the attackers had been wandering in the area for some time.\n\n\u201cAfter the attack, they jumped into a black private car and fled in the direction to Sham Shui Po,\u201d Ng said. \u201cWitnesses have told us the car had been driving in the area for a while. The attack was swift and the suspects wore similar clothing.\u201d", "description": "He was ambushed on the street by at least four men with hammers and was taken to the hospital, where he is in stable condition.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/2f193d34-f010-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e391320x770072948.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
