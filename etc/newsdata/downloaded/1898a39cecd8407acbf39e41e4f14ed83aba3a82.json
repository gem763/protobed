We took the complaints seriously and have spent the last few weeks reviewing our coverage and our editorial processes. We addressed these issues with all staff involved. The last of our review meetings was conducted yesterday afternoon.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps Antonelli was so specific about the review meetings because of the quirky timing of the retraction. On Thursday afternoon, attorney Ted Frank, head of litigation at the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute, posted the results of a FOIA request that he and the institute\u2019s Frank Bednarz had submitted:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25@blaw refused to answer my questions about their abusive journalism fail on the Leif Olson story, so we FOIA\u2019ed Penn\u2019s emails to DOL to see how it happened. As you can see, this was a total hit job, @benjaminPenn truncated & mischaracterized the Facebook posts. pic.twitter.com/CzTsMKWUBN \u2014 tedfrank (@tedfrank) October 3, 2019\n\nDavid Peikin, director of corporate communications for Bloomberg Industry Group, tells the Erik Wemple Blog that the retraction\u2019s timing was \u201cunrelated\u201d to the FOIA release.\n\nThe FOIA documents raised fresh questions about how Bloomberg Law reporter Ben Penn went about researching the story. The correspondence shows that Penn was fully aware that his story could upend the career of a new Labor appointee. He\u2019d found a Facebook thread from 2016 written by Olson, a lawyer who\u2019d recently started at the agency\u2019s wage and hour division. As Penn wrote to Labor public affairs officials on Aug. 30, the Facebook material \u201creferences two anti-Semitic tropes.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd so he ripped away: \u201cIf DOL was previously aware of it, did this post raise any flags inside the administration about whether he is fit for government service?\u201d wrote Penn.\n\nAs everyone now knows, the red flags were pretty well confined to the offices of Bloomberg Law. On Sept. 3, the outlet published the fruits of Penn\u2019s inquiry under the headline, \u201cTrump Labor Aide Quits After anti-Semitic Facebook Posts Surface.\u201d The part about quitting was 100 percent accurate, as a Labor statement confirmed: \u201cToday, the Department of Labor accepted the resignation of Leif Olson effective immediately.\u201d That statement arrived at Penn\u2019s inbox within four hours of his inquiry. (Olson was later reinstated.)\n\nAnd the part about anti-Semitic Facebook posts? Well, let\u2019s just say that haste and shoddy journalism teamed up to create a disaster. Olson\u2019s dreaded Facebook post wasn\u2019t \u201canti-Semitic\u201d in any way. In fact, it mocked the hateful thought patterns and conspiracy theories of anti-Semites, making it an example of anti-anti-Semitism. Bloomberg Law had somehow failed to pick up on the satire in its initial reading of the social media activity and so, apparently, did the Department of Labor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA close reading of the material yielded the conclusion that Olson was engaging in exalted satire, though there was more to the Facebooking. Subsequent messages made it even plainer that there was nothing straight-faced about Olson\u2019s observations about Jews. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out the correct response to epic sarcasm,\u201d reads a later comment. That\u2019s why Frank alleges that Penn \u201ctruncated\u201d the Facebook thread in his inquiry to Labor, to the detriment of journalism.\n\nAt one point in the email, Penn notes the two \u201canti-Semitic tropes.\u201d At another point, Penn asks, \u201cDoes the Labor Department find comments that are disparaging to Jews acceptable for a senior appointee?\u201d The latter formulation clearly misportrays the satirical thoughts in Olson\u2019s Facebook postings and could well have prejudiced the Labor Department\u2019s examination of the material, or possible examination of the material.\n\nWhatever the sequence of events, the episode underscores the power wielded by journalists even before they publish something. Media outlets typically vet story drafts more carefully than they do emails seeking comment for a story. In circumstances where the material can derail a career, though, such communications merit a full-on scrubdown.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn this particular case, Bloomberg Law found itself in a strange spot: Its inquiry alone appeared to have prompted the resignation of Olson. To judge from the story, Penn spoke with Olson about the situation:\n\n\u201cIt was sarcastic criticism of the alt-right\u2019s conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic positions,\u201d Olson said in an interview. He declined to respond to other questions about his resignation and the Facebook post, including whether he wishes to apologize or if he regrets his actions. The remark remained on his Facebook feed through the end of August.\n\nThe Erik Wemple Blog asked Bloomberg Law when this interview took place. The timing matters because Olson put Bloomberg Law on notice that the posts were sarcastic. According to an informed source, Olson shared this information with Penn on Saturday, Aug. 31, meaning that Bloomberg Law had a few days before the Sept. 3 publication date to review the Facebook material for satire. Somehow it just proceeded with its judgment that the posts were anti-Semitic.\n\nLet\u2019s hope that review of procedures and processes covers Labor Day weekend at Bloomberg Law.\n\nAD\n\nOn Reason, Josh Blackman wrote Thursday that Bloomberg Law should retract the whole story. Prescient!\n\nEven after the pushback that greeted the original story, Bloomberg Law published changes unequal to the harm done. Before the retraction, for example, there were bullet points atop the story that read like this:\n\nThe second bullet point \u2014 about a \u201creference that Jewish media \u2018protects their own\u2019\u201d \u2014 might have left the skimming reader with the impression that Olson wasn\u2019t kidding about this stuff.\n\nReached on the phone on Friday, Olson shared few words.\n\nHas he sent any lawyer letters to Bloomberg Law? \u201cNo,\u201d he responded.\n\nWas he pondering legal action? \u201cNo comment.\u201d\n\nHad he discussed the situation with a lawyer? \u201cNo comment.\u201d\n\nHow does he feel Bloomberg Law handled the situation? \u201cNo comment.\u201d\n\nOur first question asked whether he\u2019d received an apology. He said no. That has changed, thankfully.\n\nAD", "description": "The move comes just over one month after the story was published and immediately panned.", "authors": ["Erik Wemple", "Media Critic With A Focus On The Ups", "Downs", "Downs Of The Cable-News Industry.", "Media Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EMwqZP1N3l2QIUaiJ-eZ47hMIjQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5YWQAIHDXAI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
