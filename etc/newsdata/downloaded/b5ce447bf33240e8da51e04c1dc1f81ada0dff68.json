But the pressure for blacks to forgive is often tied to racist tropes, history that disregards justice.\n\nConvicted murderers don\u2019t usually get hugs from the family of the victim. But last week, Brandt Jean explicitly told former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger that he forgave her for shooting his brother Botham and asked the judge for permission to hug her.\n\nJudge Tammy Kemp, a black woman, stepped down from the bench and also hugged Guyger \u2014 and gifted her a Bible. The court officer (also a black woman) could be seen gently caressing Guyger\u2019s hair.\n\nCNN commentator and social justice activist Van Jones was \u201cmoved\u201d by Jean's display of forgiveness.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took to Twitter to wax poetically about the power of Christian love and peddled forgiveness as the right response.\n\nJean has every right to do the thing that helps him heal and honor the memory of his brother. But in instances of unjust killings of black victims, why does the public laud responses of forgiveness and criticize those that include anger?\n\nBotham Jean's younger brother Brandt Jean hugs convicted murderer and former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger.

Her response of \u201chell no\u201d was met with at least one headline that she was \u201clashing out\u201d at the officer who killed her husband.\n\nWhen survivors of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, and the relatives of those killed during the slaughter took the stand during trial and expressed forgiveness to the man who massacred their loved ones, they were applauded for, in part, not turning to anger.\n\nThose who forgive are held up as moral exemplars, while those who do not are seen as morally lacking. The greatest sense of moral failure is reserved for those who are explicitly angry in response to wrongdoing.\n\nBut anger can also be the morally correct response, praiseworthy in its own right.\n\nIn her fascinating exploration of contempt as a moral emotion, Macalester Bell writes in \"Hard Feelings\" that contempt can have important value. Contempt can serve as a form of protest, it can help us gain insight into our world, and it can motivate change.\n\nAs a philosopher who works in ethics, I have made my career thinking about how we place ourselves in the world and what kind of world is most conducive to human flourishing. This includes thinking about how humans respond to the things that happen around us.\n\nSometimes, emotions like anger (or contempt) are the exact right emotions to feel and to express. If anger can help us understand our place in the world and drive us to make the world that we occupy better, then good for anger. The most important feature of anger, properly directed, is the recognition that a wrong has occurred.\n\nTo the extent that one\u2019s anger motivates one to right wrongs, anger can be a tool of achieving justice. In this sense, anger is also tied to self-respect. Anger is a recognition that one is deserving of just treatment and that one is willing to demand just treatment, even if the demand is ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nThe pressure for black people to be especially forgiving in the face of wrongdoing cannot be disentangled from a racist history that has generally met black demands for justice with violence. Stereotypes of black docility that go back to the days of the \u201chappy slave\u201d and continue presently with the \u201cMagical Negro\u201d primarily serve to make white people feel good about themselves.\n\nIt is telling that some groups of people in this country are not only allowed to be angry but also are praised for it.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh\u2019s red-faced denials of sexual assault during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing were widely praised (mostly by other white men) as the appropriate response to the \u201csullying\u201d of his character. Meanwhile, Michael Brown\u2019s stepfather (a black male) faced an investigation and had to apologize for his expression of anger after a grand jury announced there would be no indictment for his stepson's killer.\n\nEven when anger is understandable or justifiable, it is not often regarded as praiseworthy, especially when that anger comes from black people. When one understands the expression of anger as, in some instances, a demand for self-respect, then it becomes clear why forgiveness is often seen as the only \u201cright\u201d response for black people.\n\nIn response to the stunning coincidence of prosecution witness Joshua Brown\u2019s murder Friday, The Dallas Morning News called on the public to not lose what was \u201cgained\u201d from last week\u2019s \u201cheartening display of \u2026 forgiveness\u201d by Brandt Jean. That\u2019s not only a call against a rush to judgment. It is also a call against anger.\n\nBut if anger can fuel a push for justice for victims like Botham Jean, Joshua Brown and others whose names are known only to their loved ones, then anger is the exact right response. It is time for more people to be righteously and unapologetically angry.\n\nYolonda Wilson is a fellow at the National Humanities Center and an encore public voices fellow with the OpEd Project.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/2019/10/10/black-police-victims-anger-forgiveness-brandt-jean/3913590002/", "description": "The pressure for blacks to forgive is tied to racist tropes, history that disregards justice", "authors": ["Yolonda Wilson", "Opinion Contributor", "Published P.M.
