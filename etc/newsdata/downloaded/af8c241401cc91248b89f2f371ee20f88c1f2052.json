Should Binance decide somewhere down the line that it wants to list the Klaytn network\u2019s Klay token, it could really shake up the cryptocurrency scene in the whole East Asia region.\u201d\n\nKakao has previously announced plans to list the token on Upbit\u2019s Singaporean and Indonesian exchange branches, but a potential Binance listing would be \u201ca game-changer,\u201d says Lee.\n\nThe Klaytn network was launched in June this year by Kakao\u2019s Ground X subsidiary, with council members including Unionbank of the Philippines and a host of domestic companies.\n\nKakao said the partnership would help the parties promote \u201cmass blockchain adoption globally.\u201d\n\nBinance\u2019s own comments in the announcement were eye-opening, too. The company made specific mention of LG, one of the biggest-name Klaytn partners on the council.\n\nWei Zhou, the Binance CFO, stated,\n\n\u201cWe are excited to join the Klaytn Governance Council and to work with other key partners like LG Electronics and Kakao, who are the most innovative companies in Asia, to foster the growth of the global blockchain ecosystem in this joint and open effort.\u201d\n\nReaders may recall that LG is actively looking into blockchain phone technology, has registered a patent for a smartphone cryptocurrency wallet and has a business arm working with a major South Korean bank on a digital token project.\n\nKakao has already won the support of many of South Korea\u2019s biggest tech companies.\n\nGround X recently unveiled a Klaytn-branded Samsung smartphone, and Samsung\u2019s own smartphone wallet service has been made Klay-compatible. Hyundai\u2019s blockchain arm, Hdac, has also begun cooperating with Ground X on Klaytn.", "description": "Cryptocurrency Exchange Binance has joined South Korean chat app giant Kakao\u2019s Klaytn blockchain project as the newest member of its governance council.
