The complaint centered on a call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump urged his counterpart to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden over Biden's son's connections to a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nReports of the complaint prompted House Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\nDuring his testimony, Maguire said he delayed passing along the complaint to Congress because of executive privilege to protect communications with the president. Maguire said that because presidential communications are confidential due to executive privilege, he couldn't immediately pass along the complaint to Congress.\n\n\"The White House did not direct me to withhold the complaint,\" Maguire said.\n\nThe complaint was released Thursday ahead of Maguire's hearing. Maguire said that because the White House had released the memo of the call between Trump and Zelensky, the complaint no longer fell under executive privilege and therefore could be released to Congress.\n\nHere are the top moments from Maguire's testimony:\n\n'I believe everything involved in this matter is totally unprecedented'\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, questioned Maguire on whether the complaint mentioned \"serious wrongdoing by the president of the United States.\"\n\n\u201cYes, that this is the subject of the allegation of the complaint,\" Maguire replied. He added: \"I am not authorized as the director of National Intelligence to provide material that has executive privilege.\"\n\nSEE FOR YOURSELF: Read the full declassified text of the Trump whistleblower complaint\n\nSchiff asked why Maguire went first to the White House and then to the Justice Department for advice on how to handle the complaint, despite Trump and Attorney General William Barr being subjects of the complaint.\n\n\"I believe everything involved in this matter is totally unprecedented,\" Maguire said.\n\nSchiff asked whether Maguire discussed the whistleblower complaint with Trump, but he declined to say.\n\n\u201cI will not divulge privileged conversations that I have as the director of National Intelligence with the president of the United States,\" Maguire said.\n\n'I think the whistleblower did the right thing'\n\nSchiff also pressed Maguire on whether he thought the whistleblower is a \"political hack,\" quoting name-calling from Trump.\n\nTrump last week derided the whistleblower as a \"political hack\" and said his communication with a foreign leader is a \"ridiculous story.\"\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe the whistleblower is a political hack, do you director,\" Schiff said.\n\n\u201cI believe the whistle-blower is operating in good faith,\" he said, adding the whistleblower \"has followed the law.\u201d\n\nVisual timeline: A diagram of events in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump\n\nGraphics: Analyzing the Trump-Ukraine \"transcript\" in 3 charts\n\nMaguire added that it is his job \"to support and lead the entire intelligence community.\"\n\n\"That individual works for me,\" he continued. \"Therefore it is my job to make sure I support and defend that person.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he thinks the whistleblower is disloyal to the United States, Maguire said \"absolutely not.\"\n\n\"I believe that the whistleblower followed the steps every step of the way,\" he said. \u201cI think the whistleblower did the right thing.\u201d\n\n'We know how to keep a secret'\n\nRep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican in the House Intelligence Committee, questioned Maguire on whether members of the Intelligence community were the ones to leak the whistleblower's complaint to the media.\n\n\u201cI lead the intelligence community \u2014 we know how to keep a secret,\" Maguire replied.\n\nHe said he is unsure how the press found out about the complaint, adding \"where they get their information from, I don't know.\"\n\n\"But it was not from the intelligence community, from me or from my office,\" he continued.\n\nNunes continued to press Maguire on how the complaint could have leaked, pointing to past conversations between the president and world leaders being reported on without a memo of the calls being released.", "description": "Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, faced scrutiny Wednesday from lawmakers investigating the whistleblower complaint.", "authors": ["Rebecca Morin", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kd766dZB6yBzMp9.Izdm4w--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/3979b340-fdc4-4e37-918e-d09fc1de5d66/4e5344e1-28ea-552f-8760-0d7c40fc177d/data_3_0.jpg?s=768bb79b7eb65a52283e6fc2ed114d0a&c=90116108b32f8c6dcd1314f19e60db10&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
