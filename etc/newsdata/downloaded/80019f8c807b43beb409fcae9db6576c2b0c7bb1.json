You could fill a book with examples like that.\n\nHarry Frankfurt, a professor of philosophy emeritus at Princeton University in the US, argues that when someone lies they have to be aware of the truth, because a lie is defined in opposition to it. Bull****, by contrast, is just a stinking flow of fakery a la Donald Trump.\n\nIn my view, Johnson indulges in both. The claim that suspending parliament for five weeks is because the government needs the time for its \u201cexciting domestic agenda\u201d (pass me the sick bag) is, to me, clearly concocted in opposition to the truth that the decision was nakedly political and intended to frustrate scrutiny of the government\u2019s disastrous Brexit plans. As the Scottish courts have found, although the Supreme Court will have the final say with an English court having ruled differently.\n\nThe rambling, incoherent speeches? The \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d questions sessions? They\u2019re just full of bull****.\n\nWhich is the \u201cno pact with the Brexit party\u201d vampire promise? A lie or just the latest serving of verbal diarrhoea?\n\nIt scarcely matters.\n\nYou might very well wonder why Johnson, having turned himself from the liberal \u201cHeineken\u201d Tory into a pasty-faced imitation of Far-cula, doesn\u2019t just finish off the job?\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s because there\u2019s still a sprig of garlic above the front door of No 10, put there by Dominic Cummings.\n\nThe party\u2019s 20-some-odd corps of whipless wonders have repeatedly raised questions over whether Cummings is actually a Conservative. He certainly doesn\u2019t seem to like the party very much.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t have much time for Far-cula either and kept him at arm\u2019s length from Vote Leave during the EU referendum campaign for fear that he\u2019d have middle-class voters reaching for their crucifixes and running to Remain in search of holy water.\n\nTeaming up with Far-cula risks many of those people seeking solace in the arms of the Liberal Democrats.\n\nA pact would also force the narcissistic Johnson to share the limelight. That\u2019s not something he seems overly fond of doing.\n\nThese may all serve to stop it from happening. But based on previous form, Johnson\u2019s statements on the matter are as good as meaningless.", "description": "Nigel Farage has been sucking the blood out of the Conservative Party for years, but despite donning his bat wings and impaling the country on his own fangs, Boris Johnson has so far refused to let Far-cula into the house to deliver the coup-de-grace.", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/12/14/johnson-farage.jpg"}
