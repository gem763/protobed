Turkish-Russian patrols along the border have also been envisaged. Arguably, the cornerstone of the deal is that Turkey pledged to continue its \u2018Peace Spring\u2019 offensive in a limited area \u2013 up to 32km inside Syrian territory, and not to expand the operation further.\n\nAlso on rt.com Ankara says \u2018no need to start new Syria offensive\u2019 after Erdogan-Putin talks\n\nWhile the situation on the ground is still volatile, and there\u2019s always a danger of captured ISIS fighters exploiting the \u201cmess\u201d and breaking free, the meeting was an important breakthrough, Kourosh Shamlou, an attorney and Middle East specialist, told RT, adding that it showcased Russia\u2019s new, more prominent role in Syria.\n\n\n\nIt is a successful meeting. More important for Vladimir Putin, because Russia is now filling up the gap left by the US. The US is now pulling out all its forces and Russia is coming in.\n\nThe memorandum has been hailed as a success, while the US-Turkey deal agreed on Thursday that paved the way for a fragile 120-hour ceasefire barely got a mention during the Sochi talks.\n\nYusuf Erim, political analyst at TRT World, told RT he believes that without the subsequent Russia-Turkey deal, the one between Washington and Ankara was likely to be born dead:\n\n\u201cTurkey was able to cement the diplomatic gains they made at the table with the US by having them reflected onto the field by dealing with the Russians, because while in reality the US presence is waning\u2026 so any deal with the Americans to have meaningful consequences on the field needs to be reaffirmed by the Russian President\u201d.\n\nCalling the deal agreed by Putin and Erdogan a \u201cwin-win\u201d for every interested party, Erim noted that Washington, although sidelined, should also be pleased with the outcome.\n\nAlso on rt.com Russian & Syrian forces to deploy to northeastern Syria outside Turkey operation zone \u2013 Putin-Erdogan agreement\n\n\u201cI think the US is happy with this deal, because this deal could quite possibly save the deal which the US made with Erdogan less than a week ago in Ankara, because the deal was fragile.\u201d\n\nErim said he believes that once the deal comes into effect and Syria, Russia and Turkey begin patrolling the borders, there will not be \u201cany room to breathe\u201d for either ISIS militants or the Kurdish militias that Ankara views as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK).\n\nLike this story?
