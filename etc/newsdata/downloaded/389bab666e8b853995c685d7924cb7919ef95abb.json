But the moisturizer that worked so well in your 20s and 30s might not meet the same needs your skin has by the time you hit your 40s and 50s. As Dr. Marla Diakow of Schweiger Dermatology Group explains, as your skin begins to produce less oil and there is a breakdown of elastic and collagen fibers, \u201cthe skin becomes drier and thinner with more laxity.\u201d Generally, this means a proper skin-care regimen needs to include \u201cproducts that strengthen and thicken the dermis, provide moisture retention and barrier renewal, yet are not too harsh or abrasive,\u201d she says. So we turned to ten dermatologists to find out which moisturizers are the best for mature skin types for every budget. (Note that we\u2019re mainly talking about the skin on your face \u2014 if you\u2019re looking for a new lotion to moisturize your body, feel free to check out our guide for all skin types.)\n\nBest drugstore moisturizers for mature skin\n\nCetaphil Rich Hydrating Night Cream $12 (was $20, now 40% off) \u201cOverall, using gentle products made from high-quality ingredients with less irritants, fragrances, and additives becomes more important,\u201d explains Diakow. Two of our experts recommended using drugstore brand Cetaphil for its gentle, affordable products. Cetaphil can \u201chydrate skin without clogging pores\u201d and \u201ccan be used year round and is tolerated well on almost all skin types,\u201d says Dr. Francesca Fusco. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest moisturizer for itchy, mature skin\n\nSkinCeuticals AGE Interrupter \u201cMany patients with mature skin come to the office complaining of itching or irritation,\u201d says Gonzalez, which is a sign that your skin barrier is compromised. She recommends looking for moisturizers that contain ceramides, which are lipids that work to repair and protect the skin barrier. She suggests SkinCeuticals AGE Interrupter because it also contains blueberry extract which \u201cacts as an antioxidant which helps to both strengthen the skin and prevent wrinkles.\u201d While SkinCeuticals is a luxury product with a luxury price, it also \u201chelps diminish the appearance of crepey skin, which makes it a great option for aging skin.\u201d $162 at Dermstore Buy\n\nBest fragrance-free moisturizer for mature skin\n\nBest moisturizer for oily, mature skin\n\nPeter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream She also recommends this oil-free, noncomedogenic moisturizer from Peter Thomas Roth that will give your skin a glow, without it getting greasy. $52 at Amazon Buy $52 at Dermstore Buy\n\nBest moisturizers for dry, mature skin\n\nVichy Aqualia Thermal Rich Cream Moisturizer $23 (was $31, now 26% off) According to King, \u201cthe most effective moisturizers combine both humectants and emollients.\u201d She recommends the Vichy Aqualia Thermal Rich Cream because it\u2019s packed with both, including hyaluronic acid (\u201ca powerful humectant\u201d), shea butter (\u201ca great emollient\u201d), and glycerin (which is both). Though she does warn that the cream has a light fragrance, which means it may not be a good bet for those who are sensitive, \u201cif you are not, the fragrance is light and very nice.\u201d $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Amazon Buy\n\nSkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore 2:4:2 As we age, \u201cour cells become less robust in maintaining their role integrity and dry up and shrink. What we see, as a result, are lines and dry skin,\u201d says Dr. Julie Russak, founder of the Russak Dermatology Group. SkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore 2:4:2 is a lipid replenisher that \u201crestores the natural physiological composition of our cell wall\u201d so that \u201cyounger, healthier cells\u201d can take over. \u201cYou can literally feel the ingredients quench depleted skin,\u201d she promises. $128 at Dermstore Buy\n\nDermaceutic Hyal Ceutic Intense Moisturizer \u201cThis French moisturizer is a favorite in my office,\u201d says Dr. Melissa Doft, founder of Doft Plastic Surgery. With a combination of low and high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (for better penetration), aloe vera, shea butter, and vitamin E, it is an excellent choice for dry and mature skin. \u201cEveryone should have one in their medicine cabinet.\u201d $72 at Amazon Buy $72 at Amazon Buy\n\nNeutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Water Face Gel Moisturizer for Dry Skin Zeichner also loves this hyaluronic acid-packed Hydroboost Gel Cream from Neutrogena which \u201cacts like a sponge to pull in water to the outer skin layer to hydrate and plump, even improving the appearance of some fine lines.\u201d $20 at Ulta Beauty Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest moisturizers for mature skin with retinol\n\nRoC Deep Wrinkle Night Cream According to Dr. Zeichner, \u201cretinol is perhaps the best-studied ingredient we have over the counter to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles,\u201d which can also \u201chelp rebuild and strengthen mature skin.\u201d However, it is important to note that retinol does make the skin more photosensitive, so it is especially important to apply sunscreen every morning if you aren\u2019t already. $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nRevision Skincare D.E.J. Night Face Cream \u201cDEJ, or dermal-epidermal junction, is where we store collagen. As we age, we produce this collagen less efficiently, so the skin loses its natural elasticity,\u201d says Russak. So finding products that will boost the natural production of collagen will result in skin that looks and feels tighter. She calls this one from Revision Skincare an \u201call-in-one moisturizer that works overtime to hydrate the skin and address any visible signs of aging.\u201d It also contains 0.25% retinol, a Vitamin A derivative, which increases cell turnover deep within the skin. \u201cThese newer cells reflect light much better, they look healthier, and in turn revive the skin to look brighter.\u201d $150 at Amazon Buy $150 at Amazon Buy\n\nChantecaille Retinol Intense \u201cI always recommend Vitamin C and Retinol for mature skin,\u201d says Doft. This face lotion also contains green tea and niacinamide for extra brightening, making it \u201cthe perfect choice for aging skin.\u201d $140 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nBest tinted moisturizer for mature skin with SPF\n\nEltaMD UV Elements Tinted Broad-Spectrum SPF 44 Speaking of sunscreen, Diakow says that this product is among the best for daily use as a combination moisturizer and sunscreen because not only does it provide \u201cbroad-spectrum UV protection using completely safe and strong mineral ingredients only\u201d but it also contains hyaluronic acid. Plus, \u201cit has a beautiful universal tint which can blur pigment irregularities, blotchiness, or fine lines which are common concerns in mature skin.\u201d She recommends using one pump for the face, one pump for the neck and decolletage, and one pump for the back of the hands. $34 at Amazon Buy $34 at Dermstore Buy\n\nBest summer moisturizer for mature skin\n\nTatcha Water Cream Moisturizer Doft also loves the \u201cthe texture and the light hydrating feel\u201d of the Water Cream by Tatcha. She adds that it is safe for all skin types and is an ideal choice during the warmer months when people tend to want to avoid heavier creams. As a bonus, \u201cthe Japanese wild rose helps reduce pores and the algae helps increase radiance.\u201d $68 at Violet Grey Buy $68 at Tatcha Buy\n\nBest nightime moisturizer for mature skin\n\nBest K-Beauty moisturizers for mature skin\n\nAmore Pacific\u2019s Time Response Skin Reserve Intensive Cream According to Dr. Kenneth Howe, the key to \u201ccreating a great moisturizer for mature skin means finding the ideal balance between how much the product moisturizes the skin and how easily it spreads on.\u201d He says that Amore Pacific\u2019s Time Response Cream is particularly successful in striking this balance due to its silky texture. And while he admits the price point can be prohibitive, \u201cits deep emollient effects \u2014 you can\u2019t find a richer night cream \u2014 go a long way toward justifying the price.\u201d Not only that, but the \u201ctrademarked Chrono-T green tea extract adds anti-aging activity, as well.\u201d $150 at Sephora Buy\n\nSulwhasoo Hydro-Aid Moisturizing Soothing Cream He also suggests the Sulwhasoo\u2019s Hydro-aid Moisturizing Soothing Cream \u2014 which also happens to be his mother-in-law\u2019s favorite product \u2014 due to its rich hydrating formula that the skin can still drink in with ease. \u201cLiriope platyphylla (sounds like a character from Greek mythology, but its common name is lily turf) and ginseng sprouts give the product its moisturizing properties, while birch sap extract soothes inflamed skin,\u201d he adds. $56 at Amazon Buy $56 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
