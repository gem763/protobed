McGruder Award for Diversity Leadership", "language": "en", "text": "Maribel Perez Wadsworth, president of the USA TODAY NETWORK and publisher of USA TODAY, today was named the winner of the News Leaders Association\u2019s 2019 Robert G. McGruder Award for Diversity Leadership.\n\nWadsworth, who joined Gannett more than 20 years ago and now oversees its 109 local newsrooms and its flagship USA TODAY, has prioritized carrying out the company\u2019s commitment to diversity. She has led initiatives to ensure that a diverse pool of candidates be considered for every open position in her division and that the hiring team include a diverse mix of decision-makers. She also backed the creation of a position focused on developing a diverse pipeline of internal and external talent.\n\n\u201cShe is deserving not only for championing diversity in hiring and promotion, but reinforcing the business case for diversity and inclusion,\u201d said Mizell Stewart III, who leads Gannett\u2019s news recruiting efforts and is the current president of the News Leaders Foundation. \u201cTo survive and thrive, news organizations must truly serve a changing America, and responding to a diverse mix of consumers is critical to our future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat makes Maribel special in this regard is her commitment to fostering the kind of environment where diversity is a core strength and value, and one that attracts diverse talent. She is the perfect choice for a McGruder Award because she practices what she preaches,\u201d said Amalie Nash, VP of local news for Gannett, in nomination of Wadsworth.\n\nThe News Leaders Association, a journalism advocacy organization, gives its annual diversity award in honor of Robert G. McGruder, a former Detroit Free Press executive editor and former managing editor of The Plain Dealer in Cleveland who spent his career championing diversity throughout news industry.\n\n\u201cI can think of nothing more meaningful in my professional life than to receive this recognition for leadership in diversity, an award that honors the legacy of the great Bob McGruder,\u201d Wadsworth said. \u201cI am grateful every day for the opportunities afforded to me by the groundbreakers and ceiling-smashers who came before. Each day I strive to pay it forward through a steadfast commitment to inclusion in our staffing and in our news coverage. This is how we, together, make a difference in our communities.\u201d\n\nWadsworth has championed an emerging leaders program in partnership with the Poynter Institute that emphasizes diversity and offers mentoring and networking opportunities with top leaders from throughout the company. The program has a 93 percent retention rate, and more than 75 percent of the participants have earned promotions.\n\nShe has also supported an internship/mentorship program that now has relationships with media organizations, including a newly formed partnership with the Sports Journalism Institute for 10 summer interns designed to attract talented students to journalism through opportunities in sports reporting and editing. It will ultimately elevate racial and gender diversity in sports departments nationwide.\n\nMichael Days, incoming president of NLA, said Wadsworth is a true diversity champion who is making a difference. \u201c(She) is proof positive that when the boss is committed to making diversity happen, it happens. It\u2019s particularly impressive that the significant gains are in top leadership roles,\" he said.\n\nWadsworth will receive her award during NLA\u2019s Sept. 9-10 conference in New Orleans. She will also be part of a three-person panel on diversity leadership on Tuesday, Sept 10.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/08/27/maribel-perez-wadsworth-wins-2019-robert-g-mcgruder-award-diversity-leadership/2136781001/", "description": "Wadsworth, the president of the USA TODAY NETWORK and publisher of USA TODAY, was named the recipient of the News Leaders Association\u2019s annual diversity award.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published P.M.
