Physically strong and capable of scoring left foot, right foot or with his head inside the area no one believes he has lost his natural instincts but the view is that he is also a player who needs the confidence of a coach and regular starts - going to Madrid aged 22 was always going to be a risk.\n\nThe luck has not gone for him either. In late September he started in a midweek game against Osasuna as Zinedine Zidane rested his senior players. Jovic might have scored in the first half but lifted his shot just over from the edge of the six-yard box.\n\nIn the second half he did put the ball in the back of the Osasuna net after running onto a pass from Lucas Vazquez.\n\nTo the naked eye he was level with the last defender but when VAR reviewed the goal it judged him to have been the end of a bootlace offside.\n\nJovic thought he'd opened his account for Real Madrid when he found the net against Osasuna\n\nBut the Serbian was denied by the Video Assistant Referee having just strayed offside\n\nJovic at Real Madrid Matches: 8 (7 La Liga; 1 Champions League) Starts: 3 (all La Liga) Minutes: 284 Goals: 0 Assists: 0\n\nHe was back in the team at the weekend but this time there were no near misses. He was anonymous until taken off on 65 minutes.\n\nThe Marca verdict on his performance made for depressing reading: 'There was news of him in the first half an hour. When he did appear it was only to give the ball away. It's a worry because he does not give even one reason to believe in him.'\n\nThere were stories as early as August suggesting Madrid were looking to loan at their \u00a358million acquisition. They were ahead of their time \u2013 he had not long returned from injury. And they are still not ready to give up on the player just yet but it is hard to see how he makes a place for himself.\n\nOne of his biggest problems is the enduring level of performance from Karim Benzema. He top scored with 30 goals in 51 games last season and has made his way on to the long Balon d'Or shortlist.\n\nAll the time Real Madrid are playing either 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3, which Zidane's feels he has to do if he is to get the best out of Hazard, then the only way Jovic gets into the team is if he can dethrone Benzema, and there is now a long line of strikers who have tried and failed to do that.\n\nKarim Benzema and Jovic have a debate during the defeat to Real Mallorca last weekend\n\nA goal to save Real's flagging Champions League campaign will endear Jovic to the fans\n\nHe may get a chance from the bench tonight and if he can score the goal that puts Real Madrid's Champions League campaign back on track then things could change for him. But this still feels like the wrong player for the wrong club.\n\nBayern coach Nico Kovac is a big Jovic fan. He persuaded Jovic's dad that his son should sign on loan for Eintracht Frankfurt back in 2017.\n\nThe problem with Jovic's chances of ending up at Bayern this January is that Kovac is still not really trusted to have much influence on signings at Bayern \u2013 that much was evident in the summer when Bayern passed on the signing.\n\nIf he could start scoring everything would change, but to start scoring he needs to start playing and that, at Real Madrid can sometimes be the most difficult thing.", "description": "PETE JENSON IN SPAIN: Real Madrid desperately need goals to rescue their Champions League campaign but Zinedine Zidane is unlikely to trust his  out-of-sorts \u00a353m striker Luka Jovic.", "authors": ["Pete Jenson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/14/20037298-0-image-a-22_1571751629873.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
