But critics argue Trump is abandoning a U.S. ally to be slaughtered by Turkey \u2014 all while fueling chaos in the region that could allow ISIS to thrive anew.\n\nThere\u2019s also a question of what will happen to the thousands of ISIS detainees being held by the Kurds as they shift their resources to battling Turkey.\n\nHere are five things to know about Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nTrump is fulfilling a campaign promise while giving Turkey what it wants\n\nIn seeking to fulfill a campaign promise to end so-called forever wars, Trump gave Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan something he\u2019s long wanted.\n\nAnkara views the Kurdish force known as the YPG as an extension of a Turkish Kurdish insurgency and has long threatened to launch an assault against them.\n\nIt has not done so previously because of the presence of U.S. troops in the area. The YPG has led the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which has worked closely with the U.S.\n\nTrump spoke to Erdo\u011fan on Sunday before making his decision.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time Trump has acted to leave Syria after talking with Erdogan; Trump\u2019s December announcement on withdrawing from Syria came days after a phone call with Erdogan in which he reportedly told Erdogan that Syria was \u201call yours.\u201d\n\nA senior administration official insisted to reporters Monday that Trump was not giving Turkey a \u201cgreen light\u201d to invade Syria and that the move \u201cdoes not constitute a withdrawal from Syria.\u201d Of the roughly 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria, the official said just about 50 to 100 special operators will be moved to other bases in the country.\n\nBut in tweets defending his decision Monday, Trump said it is time to end \u201cridiculous Endless Wars.\u201d And minutes before the senior administration official spoke with reporters, Trump told reporters in the Roosevelt Room at the White House that \u201cit\u2019s time to come back home.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s decision could send a chilling message to Kurds and future partners\n\nKurdish officials accused the president of stabbing them in the back, and prominent figures in the United States warned a withdrawal would serve as a warning to potential future partners.\n\nTo placate NATO ally Turkey, the U.S. was already working on establishing a safe zone along the border, and the SDF had removed its defenses from near the border.\n\nBut with no solid safe zone set and the United States now leaving the border area, SDF spokesman Kino Gabriel told Arabic TV station al-Hadath Trump\u2019s decision was a \u201cstab in the back,\u201d while another SDF spokesman, Mustafa Bali tweeted that \u201cpeople here are owed an explanation.\u201d\n\nThe SDF says more than 11,000 of its troops were killed in the battle against ISIS, but Trump appeared to downplay the Kurdish role.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLater in the day, after widespread backlash from Republicans and Democrats, Trump said he would \u201cobliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy should they do anything he \u201cconsider[s] to be off limits.\u201d\n\nA follow-up tweet did not mention protection of the Kurds, but rather the need for Turkey and others to \u201cwatch over the captured ISIS fighters and families.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon has long opposed a troop pull-out\n\nTrump\u2019s decision came despite opposition from Pentagon leaders, who have long said it was important to keep U.S. forces in northern Syria to prevent an ISIS resurgence and back Kurdish allies in the face of Turkish aggression.\n\nAs recently as Saturday, U.S. European Command was touting the implementation of the safe zone to forestall a Turkish incursion.\n\nThe Pentagon released its own statement on Monday that insisted the United States is not endorsing the Turkish operation despite the pullout.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defense made clear to Turkey \u2014 as did the president \u2014 that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in northern Syria. The U.S. Armed Forces will not support, or be involved in any such operation,\u201d chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in the statement.\n\nWhen Trump first announced his plan to pull troops from Syria nearly a year ago, the move prompted then-Defense Secretary James Mattis James Norman MattisBrent Budowsky: Deep Throat's defending our democracy Meghan McCain: Trump, Giuliani 'blowing it on a JV level' Congressionally appointed panel recommends US halt Syria withdrawal MORE to resign.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperPentagon distances itself from Ukraine controversy North Korea missile test raises fears of new capabilities Trump defense head says US has stepped up attacks on Taliban since talks broke down MORE stressed in August that the United States would find a Turkish incursion into northern Syria \u201cunacceptable\u201d and would seek to prevent such an operation.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of mutual interests in northern Syria. We want to sustain the continued defeat \u2014 at least of the physical caliphate \u2014 of ISIS. That becomes a question if [the Turks] move in and the SDF is impacted,\u201d Esper added.\n\nOn Friday, following a phone call with his Turkish counterpart the day before, Esper told reporters he \u201cmade very clear to him and he agreed as well that we need to make the security mechanism work.\u201d\n\nTrump draws fire from GOP\n\nCritics of Trump\u2019s decision included several people who are typically his most staunch defenders, including his former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley Nimrata (Nikki) HaleyEx-GOP lawmaker sues South Carolina Republican Party for canceling 2020 primary Juan Williams: Why does Trump fear GOP voters? Can Carl DeMaio save the California GOP? MORE, who tweeted that leaving the Kurds \u201cto die is a big mistake.\u201d She also included the hashtag \u201c#TurkeyIsNotOurFriend.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamGraham vows to publicly question whistleblowers if Trump is impeached Key Republicans split with Trump on Biden investigation push GOP searches for impeachment boogeyman MORE (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally who previously talked Trump out of a full withdrawal, called the decision a \u201cdisaster in the making.\u201d He argued a retreat from northeast Syria \u201censures\u201d an ISIS comeback, \u201cforces\u201d the Kurds to align with Syrian President Bashar Assad, \u201cdestroys\u201d Turkey\u2019s standing with Congress and \u201cwill be a stain on America\u2019s honor for abandoning the Kurds.\u201d\n\nHe also pledged to introduce a resolution calling for Trump to reverse his decision and legislation to slap sanctions on Turkey. Graham further vowed to call for Turkey\u2019s removal from NATO if follows through on its Syria offensive.\n\nDecision leaves fate of ISIS detainees unclear\n\nThe SDF are detaining more than 10,000 ISIS fighters in makeshift prisons in northeast Syria, including\n\nabout 2,000 fighters from countries other than Syria or Iraq. The United States has been trying to convince countries to take their citizens back for prosecution with little success.\n\nDespite Trump promising during his first presidential campaign to \u201cload\u201d the Guantanamo Bay detention facility with \u201cbad dudes\u201d from ISIS, he has more recently blasted the cost of detaining people at Guantanamo as \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nIn justifying his decision to retreat from northeast Syria, Trump railed against European countries for not taking back foreign fighters, saying they \u201csaid \u2018NO,\u2019 thinking, as usual, that the U.S. is always the \u2018sucker,\u2019 on NATO, on Trade, on everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \u2018neighborhood,\u2019\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nThe White House statement Sunday and the Pentagon\u2019s statement Monday both said Turkey will now be responsible for detaining ISIS fighters.\n\nBut critics fear the SDF, which had little capacity to hold the detainees in the first place, will abandon or release them when they have to devote their resources to fighting Turkey and that Ankara won\u2019t step in to hold them.\n\n\u201cTurkey has neither the intent, desire, nor capacity to manage 60k detainees in al Hol camp, which State and DoD [inspectors general] warn is the nucleus for a resurgent ISIS,\u201d tweeted Brett McGurk, who resigned as Trump\u2019s special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition in December. He was referring to an SDF-run refugee camp in northern Syria holding several thousand ISIS family members. \u201cBelieving otherwise is a reckless gamble with our national security,\u201d he added.", "description": "President Trump has ordered U.S. military forces to retreat from northeast Syria, paving the way for Turkey to proceed with a long-planned offensive against Syrian Kurdish forces that were instrumental in the fight against ISIS.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_100419getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
