The campaign sees Mitchell standing above the perfume, naked aside from white socks, shooting down so that only the bottle obscures his body (\u201cMy butt cheeks is out!\u201d he wrote). \u201cThis was my first time doing a campaign top to bottom. From the research and creative direction, to directing the film, shooting photographs and logo placement and layout. I\u2019m so honored it could be with Comme Des Gar\u00e7ons.\u201d\n\nMitchell\u2019s campaign encapsulates the scent itself, which, true to all of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons fragrances, is completely different to anything else on a store shelf. \u201cChemically synthesized metals underscore natural notes,\u201d the company says. \u201cCopper is an olfactive exploration of perceived differences and their harmonious alignment.\u201d Essentially, you\u2019ll just have to smell it, and touch the beautiful coppery bottle, perhaps at the new Dover Street Parfums Market in Paris.", "description": "The visuals for 'Copper' celebrate black and brown skin.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da0dbecf1e281000aa6bca4/lede/1570823408421-pjimage-36.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
