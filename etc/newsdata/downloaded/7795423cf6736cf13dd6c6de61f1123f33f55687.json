According to an annual survey, cyberbullying is on the rise, particularly in South Africa.\n\nThe annually published Global Advisor Cyberbullying Study by marketing company Ipsos has revealed some troubling statistics around cyberbullying, painting an especially worrying picture for South African parents.\n\nFor the purposes of the survey, cyberbullying is defined as when \"a child or group of children (under the age of 18) intentionally intimidate, offend, threaten, or embarrass another child or group of children, specifically through the use of information technology, such as a website or chat room on the Internet, a cellular telephone, or another mobile device.\"\n\nCyberbullying in the community\n\nInterviewing 20,793 people from 28 countries, the 2018 study found that South Africa had the overall highest incidence of cyberbullying.\n\nAccording to their data, more than half (54%) of South African parents know of a child in their community experiencing cyberbullying, a substantially larger percentage than the overall average of 33%.\n\nHere's a look at the data for each country that participated:\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal experience of cyberbullying\n\nWhen it came to their own children, 25% of South African parents reported that their child had been a victim of cyberbullying. But in this case, South Africa is placed fifth. At 37%, India had the highest percentage of parents saying their child had been bullied online.\n\nGlobally this figure stands at 17%, which translates to 1 in 6 parents worldwide.\n\nSee the full list below:\n\nWhere it occurs\n\nAnswering the survey question \"How do kids who have experienced cyberbullying experience the harassing behaviour?\", 65% of parents said it was via social media.\n\nIn South Africa, 66% of parents said social media was a cyberbully's favourite platform, with mobile phones coming second at 47%.\n\nOther means of communication listed included online messaging, online chat rooms, and email.\n\nWho's doing it?\n\nShockingly, the study showed that in the majority of cases (51%), cyberbullying was carried out by a child's classmate.\n\nFor South African parents, this percentage was 67%. Other perpetrators included other youths who were strangers to the victims (29%), familiar adults (15%) and unknown adults (14%).\n\nWhat you can do about it\n\nIn SA, the Protection from Harassment Act is used to deal with digital and physical harassment, however, there are no specific laws that address cyberbullying.\n\nUnder the Protection from Harassment Act, victims will be able to obtain an interim protection order from the courts, meaning that further harassment could lead to an arrest.\n\nIn the cases where the harassers are unknown to the victims, the Act also forces digital service providers to hand over the personal information of the perpetrators in order for authorities to find and charge them.\n\nThere are no fail-safe measures to ensure your child does not experience cyberbullying ,these tips, provided by Bitdefender, may prove helpful in keeping danger at bay:\n\nNever share personal information online, regardless of whether it's with friends or strangers.\n\nNever arrange face-to-face meetings with online 'friends'.\n\nNurture a policy of honesty with your child so that they feel comfortable talking to you about people or situations they are unsure of.\n\nHas your child ever experienced cyberbullying?
