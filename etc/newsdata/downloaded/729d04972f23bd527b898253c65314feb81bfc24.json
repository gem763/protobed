We're more like 50/50, so we have a few more days until Yom Kippur to tip the scales,\" states a rabbi for Jewish organisation Aish.\n\nHow is it commemorated?\n\nOn Yom Kippur, Jewish people go to synagogue to hear and partake in prayer services.\n\nThe beginning of Yom Kippur is marked with the recital of a prayer service called Kol Nidre, which takes place at sundown on the eve of the festival.\n\n\"Ironically, it is not really a prayer at all, but rather a statement. A statement that deals with promises, vows and other sorts of verbal commitments commonly made in the course of the year,\" Orthodox Jewish organisation Chabad states.\n\nOn a typical day at synagogue, three prayer services are held.\n\nHowever, on the Day of Atonement, an additional two prayer services are recited.\n\nDuring the services, special passages are read from the Torah and \"Vidui\" \u2013 confessions \u2013 are chanted.\n\nA special memorial prayer called \"Yizkor\" is also recited in synagogue on Yom Kippur.\n\nThe prayer is observed in memory of relatives and friends who have passed away.\n\nWhen Jewish people go to synagogue on the day of the observance, it is customary to wear white, as a symbol of atonement and purity.\n\nThose who are devout may also refrain from partaking in activities such as using electricity, driving, washing or wearing leather.\n\nThe end of the fast is marked by the blowing of the shofar, an ancient musical instrument typically made from a ram's horn.\n\nThe shofar is also blown on Rosh Hashanah and on every morning of the month of Elul, which precedes the Jewish New Year.", "description": "The Jewish festival of\u00a0Yom Kippur\u00a0is perceived as the holiest day of the year in Judaism.
