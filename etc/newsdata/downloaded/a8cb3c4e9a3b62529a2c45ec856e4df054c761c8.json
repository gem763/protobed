It would have been better if it had stayed that way. The immature and inexperienced young German director Christiane Lutz \u2013 the new Mrs Jonas Kaufmann, by the way \u2013 makes a total hash of it.\n\nRigoletto is one of Verdi\u2019s most popular operas. Glyndebourne Touring has assembled a good international cast, with a capable conductor, Thomas Blunt. What could possibly go wrong? Enter Ms Lutz.\n\nHers is a truly crazy production. Rigoletto becomes Charlie Chaplin, with two other Chaplin doppelg\u00e4ngers hanging around, and a ridiculous old man who strips off (yuk!) during the overture.\n\nRigoletto becomes Charlie Chaplin - Nikoloz Lagvilava is a sonorous and eloquent Rigoletto and Vuvu Mpofu shows considerable promise as Gilda\n\nHe\u2019s Rigoletto as an old man, who ends up getting killed by another invented geriatric, this time apparently the Duke (in this a film director) as an oldster. Oh, and also, during the overture, the film director (ie the Duke, keep awake at the back) sires a child who, 17 years later, emerges as Rigoletto\u2019s daughter Gilda.\n\nSo when the Duke seduces her, he\u2019s committing incest. Lovely jubbly!\n\nThis is the moment when we need Michael Winner to return, to say \u2018Calm down, dear!\u2019\n\nGlyndebourne Touring has assembled a good international cast, with a capable conductor, Thomas Blunt... Matteo Lippi (above with Roisin Walsh as Page) is a fine, honey-toned Duke\n\nThankfully, Kaufmann himself has given up singing the Duke, so has a cast-iron alibi never to appear in this one. But even if he was still singing it, I bet he wouldn\u2019t. Because he knows all the comment will be reserved for his wife\u2019s production, with little left for the singers.\n\nPoor them. Nikoloz Lagvilava is a sonorous and eloquent Rigoletto; Matteo Lippi a fine, honey-toned Duke; and Vuvu Mpofu shows considerable promise as Gilda.\n\nIf you want to go to Glyndebourne on Tour, why not try Annabel Arden\u2019s delightful take on L\u2019Elisir D\u2019Amore? Mrs Kaufmann should go along; she might learn something. But I\u2019m not holding my breath.\n\nglyndebourne.com", "description": "Glyndebourne has never done Rigoletto before.
