Johnson VA Medical Center in Clarksburg and provide justice for victims. The Justice Department late last week confirmed that it had launched a criminal investigation into the deaths, underscoring the gravity of the situation and the magnitude of the multiple investigations underway.\n\nThe scandal has drawn the ire of lawmakers \u2014 including Sen. Joe Manchin III, West Virginia Democrat \u2014 and veterans groups, but details remains scarce. Even the secretary said he has largely been kept in the dark and often is unaware of basic facts surrounding the inquiries at his department\u2019s facility.\n\n\u201cThe sad part of this,\u201d Mr. Wilkie said in an interview on the sidelines of a major veterans suicide prevention conference late last week, \u201cis that I got most of my information, as Sen. Manchin has, from the newspapers. You all know as much about what\u2019s going on there \u2026 as we do, as the centers do. Some seem to know more.\n\n\u201cThis has been going on too long,\u201d he said. \u201cWe owe that to the people who have suffered to get this thing done.\n\nMr. Wilkie, who took over at the VA just over a year ago, also detailed the department\u2019s efforts to reduce veteran suicides and the strides made in reducing wait times at medical centers across the country. He also praised former Defense Secretary James Mattis, who resigned last year amid deep disagreements with President Trump.\n\nMr. Wilkie, a reserve officer in the U.S. Air Force, served as Mr. Mattis\u2019 undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness. Mr. Mattis is making headlines again this week as he promotes his new book and offers fresh details about his break from the Trump administration.\n\nBut Mr. Wilkie made his most passionate comments about the situation in Clarksburg, where at least 11 deaths in 2017 and 2018 are under investigation. One suspicious death reportedly centers on a patient who was given a fatal dose of insulin despite having no diagnosis of diabetes.\n\nMuch like the VA secretary, lawmakers say they are growing angry at the lack of clarity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m frustrated that I\u2019m not getting answers because of the ongoing investigation,\u201d Mr. Manchin, a member of the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, said in a statement last week.\n\n\u201cAll of the facts will come out and no one in the VA system will be protected if they had any involvement in this horrible crime against veterans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe owe every veteran the best possible care they\u2019ve earned.\u201d\n\nThe VA inspector general\u2019s office would not directly address Mr. Wilkie\u2019s comments about the lack of information being shared but said it continues to investigate allegations of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cAt this time, we cannot comment further on those activities. As is always the case, the [VA inspector general] works with the department to identify and urgently address allegations related to patient safety. The care and safety of our veterans and their families remain our top priority,\u201d VA Inspector General Michael J. Missal said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for the Clarksburg VA facility told CNN last week that the allegations do not involve any current employees and that the center has put new safeguards into place. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Northern District of Virginia said it began investigating \u201cas soon as potential criminal conduct was discovered and continues to be a top priority.\u201d\n\nThe office did not say when the investigation could be completed.\n\nWhile getting answers on the Clarksburg situation remains a top priority, Mr. Wilkie said, the VA has made huge strides on the broader issue of reducing wait times at clinics across the country. Officials said more work needs to be done but stressed that wait times at many VA facilities are lower now than at private doctors\u2019 offices.\n\n\u201cAt this point, in the last few days of August, we\u2019ve had 1.5 million more appointments this year than we did all of last year,\u201d Mr. Wilkie told The Times. \u201cVeterans are voting with their feet.\u201d\n\nPreventing veteran suicides, the secretary said, also remains a top priority for his department. Mr. Wilkie said the Trump administration, which established a governmentwide task force this year to tackle the issue, has put more resources into veteran suicides than ever before.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had the presidential spotlight on an issue like suicide,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Wilkie also spoke highly of Mr. Mattis but steered clear of the retired Marine Corps general\u2019s public disagreements with the president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on that, other than to say he\u2019s always been very kind to me, and he\u2019s a great combat leader and somebody I was very proud to work for and with,\u201d the secretary said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
