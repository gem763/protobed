It was very revealing.\n\nAt mid-concert, the chairman of the Kennedy Center, David M. Rubinstein, came out to greet the audience and the V.I.P.s. He welcomed the different ambassadors, then he went through the cabinet members present and then the Supreme Court justices. He introduced Justice Samuel Alito, who got a smattering of applause. Then he introduced Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, seated in the balcony. First many women in the audience stood up to applaud. And then everyone stood up. And then everyone applauded. And then everyone applauded more. And then some people cheered. And then some whistled. And it went on and on and on.\n\nIt was extraordinary. I\u2019ve been to a lot of Kennedy Center concerts, and a few when the president, sitting in his official box, was introduced. But I\u2019ve never witnessed anything like the reception for Justice Ginsburg. And this was not a totally liberal audience. There were many older G.O.P. donors and corporate types there. This was a spontaneous, bipartisan expression of respect for, and longing for, a national leader of integrity and humility \u2014 after three years of a president utterly without shame, for whom no ethical red line has been too red to cross.\n\nThere is still a civic pulse in this country. Some Americans still support President Trump, but far, far more are exhausted and disgusted by him. And that is why his latest outrage is so dangerous to him. He knows that we know that many Republicans know that he committed an impeachable offense. And it\u2019s all out there now: a whistle-blower complaint filed by a C.I.A. officer detailing how Trump dangled military assistance in front of the president of Ukraine if he would do Trump a \u201cfavor\u201d and investigate bogus corruption charges against Joe Biden.", "description": "There\u2019s an approach that avoids both a \u201ccivil war\u201d and Trump\u2019s guaranteed re-election.", "authors": ["Thomas L.
