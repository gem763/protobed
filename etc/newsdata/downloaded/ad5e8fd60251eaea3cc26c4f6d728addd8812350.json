The show, which returns on September 29, will reportedly not be killing off Williamson\u2019s character, but instead will \u201corganically\u201d write the character off the series.", "description": "Production company eOne found no inappropriate behavior in internal investigation of The Rookie after allegations from actor Afton Williamson.", "authors": ["Charu Sinha"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/17/aftonwilliamson_17.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
