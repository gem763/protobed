For many circumstances, they (Liverpool) didn\u2019t drop points. It is better not to think one team is eight points ahead. It is only October.\u201d\n\nManchester United\u2019s haul of nine points is their worst from eight games since 1989-90 when they had eight and went on to finish 13th. That they were undone by a 19-year-old on his first Premier League start added to the sense of gloom over United who looked bereft of ideas as an attacking unit.\n\nThey have won only two of their last 13 Premier League games and Solskjaer\u2019s golden honeymoon period when he replaced Jose Mourinho, first as a caretaker, is now a fading memory.\n\n\u201cWe are never happy when we don\u2019t win and we are going through a very difficult period,\u201d Solskjaer said.\n\nFor Newcastle manager Steve Bruce it was his first victory over United as a manager at the 23rd attempt.\n\nHis decision to throw in Longstaff was fully vindicated as he thumped home a second-half winner.\n\n\u201cSince pre-season in China I\u2019ve said \u2018who\u2019s this kid?\u2019 He stands out with his ginger hair,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cHe has wonderful enthusiasm and he lights up your day.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s 19? So what. I\u2019m delighted for him.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "The clocks have not even gone back yet but Liverpool\u2019s fans might already be dreaming of Premier League title celebrations early next summer after a Manchester City\u2019s shock home defeat by Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday capped a perfect weeken", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/312869.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
