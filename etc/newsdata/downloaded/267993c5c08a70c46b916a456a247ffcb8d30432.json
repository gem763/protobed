The blows knocked out more than half the kingdom\u2019s oil output for days or more and threatened to drive up already high tensions between Iran and its foes in the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe predawn blasts on facilities of the state-run oil giant Aramco \u2014 which the rebel group claimed were carried out by a fleet of 10 drones \u2014 marked one of the most devastating strikes into Saudi territory claimed by the Iranian-allied Houthis in more than four years of war in Yemen.\n\nIt was also the most serious attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure in decades, which includes barrages of Scud missiles fired by Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces during the 1991 Gulf War. A NASA satellite image showed what appeared to be a long streak of black smoke flowing to the southwest from the Aramco site.\n\nAn Aramco statement said production of 5.7 million barrels of crude was suspended by the attack from \u201cprojectiles.\u201d That represents more than half of the kingdom\u2019s output and about 6 percent of global oil supply \u2014 a shortfall that could send oil prices sharply higher.\n\nThe Aramco statement did not give any timetable on how long the production could be curtailed. In Washington, the Department of Energy said that the United States was prepared to tap U.S. emergency oil reserves if necessary to cover supply disruptions.\n\nThe blasts struck facilities in the districts of Khurais and Abqaiq, Saudi officials said. That is more than 500 miles from the Houthi-controlled zones in Yemen \u2014 raising critical questions about Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to defend its territory from Houthi missile and drone attacks with apparent expanding range.\n\nThe rebels\u2019 claim of responsibility, if confirmed, further highlighted their rapidly advancing military prowess. Saudi Arabia and the United States accuse Iran of providing the Houthis with military equipment and technical expertise, a charge Tehran has denied.\n\nHouthi missiles have struck Saudi sites before, including its oil infrastructure. But the latest strike on Aramco was a symbolic blow against the historical hub of the kingdom\u2019s oil riches, and the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s plans to remake the kingdom\u2019s economy.\n\n[Trump once ordered attack on Iran, but called it off with minutes to spare]\n\nThe company is preparing an initial public offering intended to raise billions for an economic reform program championed by the crown prince to move the country away from its dependence on oil revenue.\n\nThe attacks are likely to drive up global oil prices when trading resumes after the weekend and Saudi experts assess the damage. Benchmark Brent crude was just above $60 a barrel on Friday.\n\nIn a phone call between President Trump and the crown prince on Saturday, Trump \u201cexpressed his country\u2019s readiness to cooperate with the kingdom in supporting its security and stability, stressing the negative impact of the recent terrorist attacks against Aramco facilities on the American economy, as well as the global economy,\u201d according to a Saudi readout of the call.\n\nThe crown prince told Trump that Saudi Arabia is \u201cwilling and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nHours later, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo directly blamed Iran for \u201can unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply.\u201d Pompeo, however, offered no specific evidence.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Iranian leaders after the oil site attacks.\n\nKey link in oil supply chain\n\nKhurais is one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest oil fields and is believed to produce about 1.5 million barrels per day. Abqaiq is the site of the kingdom\u2019s largest oil processing facility, operated by Saudi oil giant Aramco. It may be the world\u2019s most important piece of oil infrastructure, built to process about 7 million barrels a day of oil so that it can be shipped out of the Persian Gulf to foreign markets.\n\nSaudi Arabia produced 9.85 million barrels of oil a day in August, making up about 10 percent of the global supply.\n\nVideos posted online showed gigantic fires sending up huge plumes of smoke. Large explosions and the sounds of gunfire could be heard in some of the videos.\n\nA statement by the Saudi state news agency said that the attacks occurred about 4 a.m. and that Aramco teams had contained the fires. The statement did not say whether anyone was injured.\n\nSaudi Arabia said it was still trying to determine who had carried out the attack, despite the Houthi claim.\n\nCol. Turki bin Saleh al-Malki, a spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen, said in a statement that physical evidence was collected but that \u201cinvestigations are ongoing to determine the parties responsible for planning and executing these terrorist attacks.\u201d\n\nFor years, the Houthi rebels have framed their cross-border missile and drone attacks as retaliatory and aimed at ending the Saudi military intervention, including Saudi airstrikes that have killed thousands of civilians.\n\nThe Houthi attacks, including on civilian airports and oil installations, have become more frequent in recent months, leading to Saudi accusations that Iran has prodded the rebels into opening a new military front during Tehran\u2019s worsening confrontation with regional adversaries.\n\n[U.N. report says U.S., Britain, France could be complicit in Yemen war crimes]\n\nThe Houthis have acknowledged their alliance with Iran but denied acting on Tehran\u2019s orders. A Houthi military spokesman, quoted by the rebel al-Masirah news channel, said the group\u2019s attacks on Saudi Arabia would expand and become \u201cmore painful as long as its aggression and siege continue.\u201d\n\nGaps in Saudi defenses\n\nThe civil conflict in Yemen began in 2014, after the Houthis seized control of Sanaa, the capital. An Arab military coalition, led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, intervened in the war early in 2015, with the aim of restoring the ousted Yemeni government.\n\nThe conflict has given rise to one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters and has killed close to 100,000 people, according to a recent estimate by a crisis-monitoring group. Diplomatic efforts, led by the United Nations, have repeatedly failed to halt the fighting.\n\nThe Houthis have repeatedly tried to attack Saudi oil facilities, including last month, when a rebel drone attack on the Shaybah oil field, near Saudi Arabia\u2019s border with the United Arab Emirates, caused a fire but did not result in injuries.\n\nThe strike on Abqaiq, where crude oil is processed, targeted a \u201cvital piece\u201d of the Saudi oil production network while exposing gaps in the kingdom\u2019s defensive capabilities, said Jean-Francois Seznec, a senior fellow at the Global Energy Center at the Atlantic Council.\n\nThe installation had been targeted before, unsuccessfully, including by al-Qaeda militants more than a decade ago and more recently by the Houthis.\n\n\u201cAbqaiq cannot be attacked from the ground,\u201d Seznec said. \u201cFrom the air, it\u2019s a little more difficult to defend.\u201d\n\nRobert McNally, a former national security aide on energy matters for President George W. Bush, called Abqaiq \u201cthe crown jewel of the Saudi kingdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo single facility comes close to importance in terms of wealth creation from the kingdom,\u201d said an email from McNally, president of the consulting firm the Rapidan Energy Group. \u201cEven if damage is light, the fact that Iranian proxies have attacked the crown jewel of Saudi Arabia means the overall risk level is going up.\u201d\n\nMcNally said the repair time \u2014 and the price fluctuations on the oil market \u2014 will depend on whether \u201cunique, tailor-made\u201d components and support systems were severely damaged. Such a scenario would mean months of work ahead and oil prices possibly spiking \u201ctoward $100 a barrel,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAbqaiq not only controls 5 percent of oil global oil supply, but it handles nearly all of spare production capacity,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf the damage is light, then crude prices may rise by only a few dollars per barrel initially.\u201d\n\nEven though the United States produces most of its own crude oil and imports much of the rest from Canada, a jump in world prices affects all producers and consumers and will still have some impact for Americans at the pump.\n\nSaudi Arabia can ease any shortage in oil markets for the time being by ramping up production of light, low-sulfur crude oil that requires less processing. And it can tap supplies of crude oil it keeps in storage.\n\nBut those inventories of crude oil have been dwindling, McNally said in a note to clients. Saudi Arabia has about 188 million barrels available, enough to cover Abqaiq\u2019s estimated supply disruption of 5 million barrels a day for 37 days.\n\nThe Rapidan Energy Group cited a 2011 report estimating that the state-owned oil company Aramco could quickly reduce a disruption to about 3.5 million barrels a day \u2014 still about 3.5 percent of the world\u2019s daily oil consumption. The company has some spare stabilization facilities.\n\n\u201cUntil the attack, the oil market had been complacent about geopolitical risk and was even focusing on the possibility that President Trump could ease oil sanctions on Iran,\u201d McNally wrote. \u201cThe question is how much of a premium will be added to the oil price.\u201d\n\nMufson reported from Washington.
