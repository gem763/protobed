Don\u2019t hold your breath | Arwa Mahdawi", "language": "en", "text": "A year after Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s controversial confirmation, all eyes are back on the US supreme court justice. The New York Times published \u201ca previously unreported story\u201d last weekend that reported that, during a party at Yale, a classmate of Kavanaugh saw friends of Kavanaugh pushing \u201chis penis into the hand of a female student\u201d. A number of high-profile Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, are now calling for Kavanaugh to be impeached.\n\nKavanaugh isn\u2019t fit to preside over any court, let alone the supreme court. But, let\u2019s face it, he isn\u2019t going anywhere. There isn\u2019t a hope in hell that these new allegations will get Kavanaugh impeached or compel him to resign. If anything, the bungled way in which the Times\u2019 report was published \u2013 more on which later \u2013 may bolster support for Kavanaugh. It may even help Trump get re-elected next year.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t read the Times\u2019 story (which was excerpted from a book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, by two of the paper\u2019s reporters), there are three key claims underpinning the calls for impeachment. The first is that Kavanaugh lied during the Senate confirmation hearings, when he refuted allegations that he had thrust his penis at a student called Deborah Ramirez, saying if something like that had occurred it would have been the \u201ctalk of the campus\u201d. Well, the Times says, it was. The reporters found classmates who learned of it \u201cjust days after the party occurred\u201d.\n\nThe second issue is the Times\u2019 story. The account as reported provides evidence that Kavanaugh engaged in a pattern of sexual misconduct. Finally, there is the fact the FBI didn\u2019t seem to take its investigation into Kavanaugh seriously. The story says the alleged witness \u201cnotified senators and the FBI about this account, but the FBI did not investigate\u201d.\n\nThis reporting doesn\u2019t make Kavanaugh look good, but it doesn\u2019t tell us anything we didn\u2019t know before. It seemed clear at the time that the FBI wasn\u2019t going above and beyond in its Kavanaugh investigation. While the new allegations may support suspicions that Kavanaugh is a scumbag who is unfit for office, there is no way they will be enough to force him out \u2013 particularly since convicting someone in impeachment proceedings requires approval from two-thirds of the Senate, which the Republicans control.\n\nFurther, the Times\u2019 handling of the allegations may end up helping Kavanaugh and Trump play their favourite role: that of the victim, rather than the predator. Among other blunders, the story \u2013 published, for some reason, in the opinion section of the paper \u2013 failed to make it clear that the female student in the previously unreported penis-pushing incident didn\u2019t remember the alleged event. This important detail was later clarified in an editor\u2019s note.\n\nPredictably, conservatives had a field day when this omission was revealed: it fitted right into their narrative that Kavanaugh is the target of a liberal witch-hunt. \u201cI call for the Resignation of everybody at The New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh SMEAR story,\u201d Trump tweeted on Monday, \u201cand while you\u2019re at it, the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, which is just as phony!\u201d Trump immediately spun the Times\u2019 editorial error into proof that you can\u2019t trust the media, including its allegations against him. This won\u2019t be a one-off tweet, either: expect to see Trump bring up the Kavanaugh story again and again.\n\nHere is the thing about Kavanaugh, you see. He is not just a supreme court justice; he is the embodiment of a divided US. The hearings last year weren\u2019t so much about his behaviour as they were about privilege and power \u2013 who gets to make the rules and who gets to break them. Depressingly, it doesn\u2019t really matter what new allegations emerge when it comes to Kavanaugh; a large number of conservatives are never going to change their opinion of him. This is why it is so important that progressive Democrats are elected next year and, instead of trying to changing intransigent minds, we start changing the entire system.\n\n\u2022Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist", "description": "He is not just a supreme court justice \u2013 he has become the embodiment of a divided US.
