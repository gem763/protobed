A backlog of more than 800,000 asylum cases are stuck in the immigration courts, and the number of pending cases increased by about 50% since Trump took office.\n\nAmnesty International said in a statement: \u201cThe fact is, the US has the capacity to accept far more refugees than this. We know that we can vet them and resettle them at rates far higher than this \u2013 because the US has done it for decades.\u201d", "description": "Of the 350,000 expected to seek asylum, only 18,000 will be admitted over the next fiscal year", "authors": ["Maanvi Singh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48970d36536cfa606e4c44d6e18153f613ff4711/0_55_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e3818f976a74d6e4fb5c79c224c200bd", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
