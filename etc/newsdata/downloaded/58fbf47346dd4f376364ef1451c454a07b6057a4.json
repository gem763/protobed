Chatting to reporters, including MMA Junkie, backstage after the event, the 34-year-old was understandably pleased with his performances.\n\n\u201cIt went good, I\u2019m very happy,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody doubted, and I\u2019m here now. To the finals we go.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to prove myself, you know. Prove that I belong in this tournament. And I wanted to finish him off. I said it in the interview before we fought. Everybody\u2019s talking about his knee (but) wait to we fight, you\u2019re gonna be talking about me. And there you go!\u201d\n\nPineda is a veteran of the UFC octagon and the Bellator cage, but admitted he found the challenge of fighting two bouts in one night a testing one, and said he had to pick himself up before stepping into the cage for his semifinal fight with Kennedy.\n\n\u201cWhen I was about to come out for my second fight I was really tired,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like: \u2018Man, it\u2019s late!\u2019 I\u2019m just sitting around, gloved up, and ready to go again, but once they said: \u2018Hey! You\u2019ve got 10 minutes!\u2019 Alright, let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s fight again. Two checks, why not?!\u201d\n\nThe last man standing between Pineda and the $1 million tournament title is defending featherweight champion Palmer, and the Houston native said their respective qualities should make for a thrilling final at The Garden on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\n\u201cMan, he\u2019s a good opponent, he\u2019s a good champion,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s got good wrestling. His stand-up, anybody has power with those four-ounce gloves. So you can\u2019t underestimate those little four-ounce gloves. If he catches me, he might knock my ass out. But I think it\u2019ll be a good fight, I think we\u2019re gonna make a hell of a show in New York and we\u2019re gonna throw down. So you can\u2019t miss this fight.\u201d\n\nAnd although he knows he faces a tough test in the form of defending champion Palmer, Pineda says he\u2019s confident he can extend his finishing streak to a 29th career win in the final.\n\n\u201cMan, I\u2019m a finisher,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve just gotta work hard and get good wrestling partners. I\u201dm a wrestler myself, I\u2019ve been wrestling for a while. So I don\u2019t think that Palmer can just take me down and hold me down. He\u2019s going to get finished if he takes me down, or I\u2019ll finish him standing up, one of the two.\u201d", "description": "Houston featherweight Daniel Pineda chats to reporters after his back-to-back wins propelled him into the PFL 2019 featherweight final.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Ken Hathaway", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Dave Doyle", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/daniel-pineda-pfl-2019-playoffs-2-post-fight-interview.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
