I know it looks bad, especially for me.\"\n\nHe said he occasionally disciplined his girlfriend's children, but had grown fond of them.\n\nHe was arrested initially for the alleged parole violation, but it then took the local coroner's office several months to complete an autopsy on the baby.\n\nThe charges related to Serik's death were not filed against Alamo until February 2 to 11.\n\nAlamo's defence argued the child could have fallen while playing or the mother could have caused the injuries.\n\nHowever, the prosecution called the defence case speculative, arguing the evidence showed she was out when the fatal injuries occurred.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nThe jury accepted the prosecution's case that Alamo beat the child and on Monday found Alamo guilty of the murder that led to Serik's death.\n\nIn 2011, the baby's father had told US media his son's body had been covered in bruises.\n\nHowever Ms Nieto claimed the court had got the verdict wrong.\n\n\"I know the baby died because he fell down the stairs, his sister told me,\" the aunt said. \"She said she couldn't say nothing because of her mother, which the mother was the main witness.\n\n\"Eyewitnesses in court are the worst witnesses because they're allowed to say whatever they want,\" she said. \"There is no physical evidence linking this man to this crime.\"\n\nAlamo will be sentenced at a later date.", "description": "The aunt claims Esteban Alamo, 33, who has been found guilty of murdering baby Serik Nieto in California, never harmed him", "authors": ["Talia Shadwell", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543493.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_091019Slug_10569JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
