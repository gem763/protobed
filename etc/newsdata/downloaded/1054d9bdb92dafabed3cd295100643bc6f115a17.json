[Jorge Silva/Reuters]\n\nMocking the government\n\nOn Monday night they formed human chains using green frog soft toys which have come to symbolise the summer's protests around Victoria Harbour.\n\nThe frog, named \"Pepe\" has become a widely popular protest meme in Hong Kong, appearing in endless posters and smartphone messaging stickers, even with the features of the territory's leader Carrie Lam superimposed on its face.\n\n\"We use this frog in our communication, we sort of mock the government\", said Dorothy Chan, who took part in the protest.\n\nHong Kong has been embroiled for months in the worst unrest since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, with riot police and protesters engaged in running battles on the streets.\n\nAuthorities rejected a permit submitted by protesters for a planned march, but demonstrations were expected to go ahead regardless.\n\nPolice said on Monday they expected a \"very serious violent attack\" to mark the anniversary while the metro operator MTR closed some stations. Several large shopping malls announced they would close. Small scuffles were reported on Tuesday morning.\n\nIn an arrangement similar to that for the July 1 anniversary of the city's handover from Britain to China - when protesters ransacked the legislature - guests attending Hong Kong's traditional flag-raising ceremony were moved indoors.\n\nAl Jazeera's Scott Heidler said the authorities did not want the celebrations overshadowed, while protesters were eager to use the occasion to drive their message home.\n\n\"It's a very, very important day generally for the People's Republic of China but especially for Xi Jinping,\u201d he said. \"He has really pushed forward in his leadership this 'one China' policy and what we've seen here in Hong Kong with these protesters is going against that.\n\nHong Kong's acting leader - Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung - said at the reception that the city had become \"unrecognisable\" because of the protests, which started in June.\n\nCheung said the Hong Kong government had shown the highest sincerity by kicking off a series of community dialogues last week and will use new thinking to address the deep-rooted social issues contributing to protester grievances.\n\nXi mentioned the 'one country, two systems' policy under which Hong Kong enjoys freedoms unseen on the mainland in his speech, stressing it was crucial for the \"long-term prosperity and stability\" of both Hong Kong and Macau, formerly a Portuguese colony.\n\nGuy Saint-Jacques, Canada's Ambassador to China between 2012 and 2016, told Al Jazeera that \"unity\" remained one of China's paramount goals.\n\n\"The problem with Hong Kong is that China doesn't know how to handle the protests,\" Saint-Jacques said from Montreal. \"They don't have a habit of democracy and they don't know how it works. (And) they worry that the contestation in Hong Kong could spread to the mainland.\"\n\nChina is staging its biggest ever military parade to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.
