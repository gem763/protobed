Confiding and self-deprecating, she has a way of always managing to sound like your best friend \u2013 even when writing about her apartment on New York\u2019s Upper West Side. This wildly enjoyable collection includes her droll observations about ageing, vanity \u2013 and a scorching appraisal of Bill Clinton.\n\nRead the review\n\n99\n\nBroken Glass\n\nby Alain Mabanckou (2005), translated by Helen Stevenson (2009)\n\nThe Congolese writer says he was \u201ctrying to break the French language\u201d with Broken Glass \u2013 a black comedy told by a disgraced teacher without much in the way of full stops or paragraph breaks. As Mabanckou\u2019s unreliable narrator munches his \u201cbicycle chicken\u201d and drinks his red wine, it becomes clear he has the history of Congo-Brazzaville and the whole of French literature in his sights.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara in the 2011 film adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.

The Triwizard Tournament provides pace and tension, and Rowling makes her boy wizard look death in the eye for the first time.\n\nRead the review\n\n96\n\nA Little Life\n\nby Hanya Yanagihara (2015)\n\nThis operatically harrowing American gay melodrama became an unlikely bestseller, and one of the most divisive novels of the century so far. One man\u2019s life is blighted by abuse and its aftermath, but also illuminated by love and friendship. Some readers wept all night, some condemned it as titillating and exploitative, but no one could deny its power.\n\nRead the review\n\n95\n\nChronicles: Volume One\n\nby Bob Dylan (2004)\n\nDylan\u2019s reticence about his personal life is a central part of the singer-songwriter\u2019s brand, so the gaps and omissions in this memoir come as no surprise. The result is both sharp and dreamy, sliding in and out of different phases of Dylan\u2019s career but rooted in his earliest days as a Woody Guthrie wannabe in New York City. Fans are still waiting for volume two.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bob Dylan in New York, 1963. Photograph: Don Hunstein\n\n94\n\nThe Tipping Point\n\nby Malcolm Gladwell (2000)\n\nThe New Yorker staff writer examines phenomena from shoe sales to crime rates through the lens of epidemiology, reaching his own tipping point, when he became a rock-star intellectual and unleashed a wave of quirky studies of contemporary society. Two decades on, Gladwell is often accused of oversimplification and cherry picking, but his idiosyncratic bestsellers have helped shape 21st-century culture.\n\nRead the review\n\n93\n\nDarkmans\n\nby Nicola Barker (2007)\n\nBritish fiction\u2019s most anarchic author is as prolific as she is playful, but this freewheeling, visionary epic set around the Thames Gateway is her magnum opus. Barker brings her customary linguistic invention and wild humour to a tale about history\u2019s hold on the present, as contemporary Ashford is haunted by the spirit of a medieval jester.\n\nRead the review\n\n92\n\nThe Siege\n\nby Helen Dunmore (2001)\n\nThe Levin family battle against starvation in this novel set during the German siege of Leningrad.

The\n\nauthor gets unwittingly pregnant at 16, yet the story has a happy\n\nending.\n\nRead the review\n\n88\n\nNoughts & Crosses\n\nby Malorie Blackman (2001)\n\nSet in an alternative Britain, this groundbreaking piece of young adult fiction sees black people, called the Crosses, hold all the power and influence, while the noughts \u2013 white people \u2013 are marginalised and segregated. The former children\u2019s laureate\u2019s series is a crucial work for explaining racism to young readers.\n\n87\n\nPriestdaddy\n\nby Patricia Lockwood (2017)\n\nThis may not be the only account of living in a religious household in the American midwest (in her youth, the author joined a group called God\u2019s Gang, where they spoke in tongues), but it is surely the funniest. The author started out as the \u201cpoet laureate of Twitter\u201d; her language is brilliant, and she has a completely original mind.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A telling description of modern power \u2026 Yanis Varoufakis.

He comes up against the IMF, the European institutions, Wall Street, billionaires and media owners and is told how the system works \u2013 as a result, his book is a telling description of modern power.\n\nRead the review\n\n85\n\nThe God Delusion\n\nby Richard Dawkins (2006)\n\nA key text in the days when the \u201cNew Atheism\u201d was much talked about, The God Delusion is a hard-hitting attack on religion, full of Dawkins\u2019s confidence that faith produces fanatics and all arguments for God are ridiculous. What the evolutionary biologist lacks in philosophical sophistication, he makes up for in passion, and the book sold in huge numbers.\n\nRead the review\n\n84\n\nThe Cost of Living\n\nby Deborah Levy (2018)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dazzling memoir \u2026 Deborah Levy.

But this perfectly achieved children\u2019s novella, in which a plucky young girl enters a parallel world where her \u201cOther Mother\u201d is a spooky copy of her real-life mum, with buttons for eyes, might be his finest hour: a properly scary modern myth which cuts right to the heart of childhood fears and desires.\n\nRead the review\n\n81\n\nHarvest\n\nby Jim Crace (2013)\n\nCrace is fascinated by the moment when one era gives way to another. Here, it is the enclosure of the commons, a fulcrum of English history, that drives his story of dispossession and displacement. Set in a village without a name, the narrative dramatises what it\u2019s like to see the world you know come to an end, in a severance of the connection between people and land that has deep relevance for our time of climate crisis and forced migration.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amy Adams in Arrival, the 2015 film based on a short story by Ted Chiang. Photograph: Allstar/Paramount Pictures\n\n80\n\nStories of Your Life and Others\n\nby Ted Chiang (2002)\n\nMelancholic and transcendent, Chiang\u2019s eight, high-concept sci-fi stories exploring the nature of language, maths, religion and physics racked up numerous awards and a wider audience when \u2018Story of Your Life\u2019 was adapted into the 2016 film Arrival.\n\nRead the review\n\n79\n\nThe Spirit Level\n\nby Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett (2009)\n\nAn eye-opening study, based on overwhelming evidence, which revealed\n\nthat among rich countries, the \u201cmore equal societies almost always do\n\nbetter\u201d for all. Growth matters less than inequality, the authors\n\nargued: whether the issue is life expectancy, infant mortality, crime\n\nrates, obesity, literacy or recycling, the Scandinavian countries,\n\nsay, will always win out over, say, the UK.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest NK Jemisin explores urgent questions of power in The Fifth Season. Photograph: Laura Hanifin\n\n78\n\nThe Fifth Season\n\nby NK Jemisin (2015)\n\nJemisin became the first African American author to win the best novel category at the Hugo awards for her first book in the Broken Earth trilogy. In her intricate and richly imagined far future universe, the world is ending, ripped apart by relentless earthquakes and volcanoes. Against this apocalyptic backdrop she explores urgent questions of power and enslavement through the eyes of three women. \u201cAs this genre finally acknowledges that the dreams of the marginalised matter and that all of us have a future,\u201d she said in her acceptance speech, \u201cso will go the world. (Soon, I hope.)\u201d\n\n77\n\nSigns Preceding the End of the World\n\nby Yuri Herrera (2009), translated by Lisa Dillman (2015)\n\nMakina sets off from her village in Mexico with a package from a local gangster and a message for her brother, who has been gone for three years.

System One makes judgments quickly, intuitively and automatically, as when a batsman decides whether to cut or pull. System Two is slow, calculated and deliberate, like long division. But psychologist Kahneman argues that, although System Two thinks it is in control, many of our decisions are really made by System One.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Spoor, the film adaptation of Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead.\n\n75\n\nDrive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead\n\nby Olga Tokarczuk (2009), translated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones (2018)\n\nIn this existential eco-thriller, a William Blake-obsessed eccentric investigates the murders of men and animals in a remote Polish village. More accessible and focused than Flights, the novel that won Tokarczuk the Man International Booker prize, it is no less profound in its examination of how atavistic male impulses, emboldened by the new rightwing politics of Europe, are endangering people, communities and nature itself.\n\nRead the review\n\n74\n\nDays Without End\n\nby Sebastian Barry (2016)\n\nIn this savagely beautiful novel set during the Indian wars and American civil war, a young Irish boy flees famine-struck Sligo for Missouri.

North Korea is revealed to be rife with poverty, corruption and violence but populated by resilient people with a remarkable ability to see past the propaganda all around them.\n\nRead the review\n\n72\n\nThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism\n\nby Shoshana Zuboff (2019)\n\nAn agenda-setting book that is devastating about the extent to which big tech sets out to manipulate us for profit. Not simply another expression of the \u201ctechlash\u201d, Zuboff\u2019s ambitious study identifies a new form of capitalism, one involving the monitoring and shaping of our behaviour, often without our knowledge, with profound implications for democracy. \u201cOnce we searched Google, but now Google searches us.\u201d\n\nRead the review\n\n71\n\nJimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth\n\nby Chris Ware (2000)\n\nAt the time when Ware won the Guardian first book award, no graphic novel had previously won a generalist literary prize.

Mar\u00edas constructs an elegant murder mystery from his trademark labyrinthine sentences, but this investigation is in pursuit of much meatier questions than whodunnit.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes in the 2005 film adaptation of The Constant Gardener. Photograph: Jaap Buitendijk/AP\n\n68\n\nThe Constant Gardener\n\nby John le Carr\u00e9 (2001)\n\nThe master of the cold war thriller turned his attention to the new world order in this chilling investigation into the corruption powering big pharma in Africa. Based on the case of a rogue antibiotics trial that killed and maimed children in Nigeria in the 1990s, it has all the dash and authority of his earlier novels while precisely and presciently anatomising the dangers of a rampant neo-imperialist capitalism.\n\nRead the review\n\n67\n\nThe Silence of the Girls\n\nby Pat Barker (2018)\n\nIf the western literary canon is founded on Homer, then it is founded on women\u2019s silence. Barker\u2019s extraordinary intervention, in which she replays the events of the Iliad from the point of view of the enslaved Trojan women, chimed with both the #MeToo movement and a wider drive to foreground suppressed voices. In a world still at war, it has chilling contemporary resonance.\n\nRead the review\n\n66\n\nSeven Brief Lessons on Physics\n\nby Carlo Rovelli (2014)\n\nA theoretical physicist opens a window on to the great questions of the universe with this 96-page overview of modern physics.

Photograph: Allstar/New Regency Pictures\n\n65\n\nGone Girl\n\nby Gillian Flynn (2012)\n\nThe deliciously dark US crime thriller that launched a thousand imitators and took the concept of the unreliable narrator to new heights. A woman disappears: we think we know whodunit, but we\u2019re wrong. Flynn\u2019s stylishly written portrait of a toxic marriage set against a backdrop of social and economic insecurity combines psychological depth with sheer unputdownable flair.\n\nRead the review\n\n64\n\nOn Writing\n\nby Stephen King (2000)\n\nWritten after a near-fatal accident, this combination of memoir and masterclass by fiction\u2019s most successful modern storyteller showcases the blunt, casual brilliance of King at his best.

Her cells, taken without her knowledge during a biopsy, went on to change medical history, being used around the world to develop countless drugs. Skloot skilfully tells the extraordinary scientific story, but in this book the voices of the Lacks children are crucial \u2013 they have struggled desperately even as billions have been made from their mother\u2019s \u201cHeLa\u201d cells.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Benedict Cumberbatch in the TV adaptation of Edward St Aubyn\u2019s Patrick Melrose novels.

But you do not need to know or care about the sport, because \u2013 as with all Lewis\u2019s best writing \u2013 it\u2019s all about how the story is told.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest James McAvoy in the film adaptation of Atonement.\n\n41\n\nAtonement\n\nby Ian McEwan (2001)\n\nThere are echoes of DH Lawrence and EM Forster in McEwan\u2019s finely tuned dissection of memory and guilt. The fates of three young people are altered by a young girl\u2019s lie at the close of a sweltering day on a country estate in 1935. Lifelong remorse, the horror of war and devastating twists are to follow in an elegant, deeply felt meditation on the power of love and art.\n\nRead the review\n\n40\n\nThe Year of Magical Thinking\n\nby Joan Didion (2005)\n\nWith cold, clear, precise prose, Didion gives an account of the year her husband, the writer John Gregory Dunne, collapsed from a fatal heart attack in their home. Her devastating examination of grief and widowhood changed the nature of writing about bereavement.\n\nRead the review\n\n39\n\nWhite Teeth\n\nby Zadie Smith (2000)\n\nSet around the unlikely bond between two wartime friends, Smith\u2019s debut brilliantly captures Britain\u2019s multicultural spirit, and offers a compelling insight into immigrant family life.\n\n38\n\nThe Line of Beauty\n\nby Alan Hollinghurst (2004)\n\nOxford graduate Nick Guest has the questionable good fortune of moving into the grand west London home of a rising Tory MP. Thatcher-era degeneracy is lavishly displayed as Nick falls in love with the son of a supermarket magnate, and the novel records how Aids began to poison gay life in London. In peerless prose, Hollinghurst captures something close to the spirit of an age.\n\nRead the review\n\n37\n\nThe Green Road\n\nby Anne Enright (2015)\n\nA reunion dominates the Irish novelist\u2019s family drama, but the individual stories of the five members of the Madigan clan \u2013 the matriarch, Rosaleen, and her children, Dan, Emmet, Constance and Hanna, who escape and are bound to return \u2013 are beautifully held in balance. When the Madigans do finally come together halfway through the book, Enright masterfully reminds us of the weight of history and family.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Martin Amis recalls his \u2018velvet-suited, snakeskin-booted\u2019 youth. Photograph: Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert/Getty Images\n\n36\n\nExperience\n\nby Martin Amis (2000)\n\nKnown for the firecracker phrases and broad satires of his fiction, Amis presented a much warmer face in his memoir. His life is haunted by the disappearance of his cousin Lucy, who is revealed 20 years later to have been murdered by Fred West. But Amis also has much fun recollecting his \u201cvelvet-suited, snakeskin-booted\u201d youth, and paints a moving portrait of his father\u2019s comic gusto as old age reduces him to a kind of \u201canti-Kingsley\u201d.\n\nRead the review\n\n35\n\nThe Hare with Amber Eyes\n\nby Edmund de Waal (2010)\n\nIn this exquisite family memoir, the ceramicist explains how he came to inherit a collection of 264 netsuke \u2013 small Japanese ornaments \u2013 from his great-uncle. The unlikely survival of the netsuke entails De Waal telling a story that moves from Paris to Austria under the Nazis to Japan, and he beautifully conjures a sense of place. The book doubles as a set of profound reflections on objects and what they mean to us.\n\nRead the review\n\nOutline by Rachel Cusk\n\n34\n\nOutline by Rachel\n\nCusk (2014)\n\nThis startling work of autofiction, which signalled a new direction for Cusk, follows an author teaching a creative writing course over one hot summer in Athens. She leads storytelling exercises. She meets other writers for dinner. She hears from other people about relationships, ambition, solitude, intimacy and \u201cthe disgust that exists indelibly between men and women\u201d. The end result is sublime.\n\nRead the review\n\nFun Home by Alison Bechdel\n\n33\n\nFun Home\n\nby Alison Bechdel (2006)\n\nThe American cartoonist\u2019s darkly humorous memoir tells the story of how her closeted gay father killed himself a few months after she came out as a lesbian.

The story, told in fragments, is of Nelson\u2019s pregnancy, which unfolds at the same time as her partner, the artist Harry Dodge, is beginning testosterone injections: \u201cthe summer of our changing bodies\u201d. Strikingly honest, originally written, with a galaxy of intellectual reference points, it is essentially a love story; one that seems to make a new way of living possible.\n\nRead the review\n\n30\n\nThe Underground Railroad\n\nby Colson Whitehead (2016)\n\nA thrilling, genre-bending tale of escape from slavery in the American deep south, this Pulitzer prize-winner combines extraordinary prose and uncomfortable truths. Two slaves flee their masters using the underground railroad, the network of abolitionists who helped slaves out of the south, wonderfully reimagined by Whitehead as a steampunk vision of a literal train.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Uncomfortable truths \u2026 Colson Whitehead.

A housekeeper\u2019s fate is changed by the pranks of her employer\u2019s teenager daughter; an incorrigible flirt gracefully accepts his wife\u2019s new romance in her care home. No character acts as at first expected in Munro\u2019s stories, which are attuned to the tiniest shifts in perception.\n\nRead the review\n\n26\n\nCapital in the Twenty First Century\n\nby Thomas Piketty (2013), translated by Arthur Goldhammer (2014)\n\nThe beautifully written product of 15 years of research, Capital made its author an intellectual star \u2013 the modern Marx \u2013 and opened readers\u2019 eyes to how neoliberalism produces vastly increased inequalities. Full of data, theories and historical analysis, its message is clear, and prophetic: unless governments increase tax, the new and grotesque wealth levels of the rich will encourage political instability.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sally Rooney focuses on the uncertainty of millennial life. Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer\n\n25\n\nNormal People\n\nby Sally Rooney (2018)\n\nRooney\u2019s second novel, a love story between two clever and damaged young people coming of age in contemporary Ireland, confirmed her status as a literary superstar.

Harari\u2019s scope may be too wide for some, but this engaging work topped the charts and made millions marvel.\n\nRead the review\n\n20\n\nLife After Life\n\nby Kate Atkinson (2013)\n\nAtkinson examines family, history and the power of fiction as she tells the story of a woman born in 1910 \u2013 and then tells it again, and again, and again. Ursula Todd\u2019s multiple lives see her strangled at birth, drowned on a Cornish beach, trapped in an awful marriage and visiting Adolf Hitler at Berchtesgaden. But this dizzying fictional construction is grounded by such emotional intelligence that her heroine\u2019s struggles always feel painfully, joyously real.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Portrait of an unconventional mind \u2026 A stage adaptation of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.

The slide into savagery as civilisation collapses is harrowing material, but McCarthy\u2019s metaphysical efforts to imagine a cold dark universe where the light of humanity is winking out are what make the novel such a powerful ecological warning.\n\nRead the review\n\n16\n\nThe Corrections\n\nby Jonathan Franzen (2001)\n\nThe members of one ordinarily unhappy American family struggle to adjust to the shifting axes of their worlds over the final decades of the 20th century. Franzen\u2019s move into realism reaped huge literary rewards: exploring both domestic and national conflict, this family saga is clever, funny and outrageously readable.\n\nRead the review\n\n15\n\nThe Sixth Extinction\n\nby Elizabeth Kolbert (2014)\n\nThe science journalist examines with clarity and memorable detail the current crisis of plant and animal loss caused by human civilisation (over the past half billion years, there have been five mass extinctions on Earth; we are causing another). Kolbert considers both ecosystems \u2013 the Great Barrier Reef, the Amazon rainforest \u2013 and the lives of some extinct and soon-to-be extinct creatures including the Sumatran rhino and \u201cthe most beautiful bird in the world\u201d, the black-faced honeycreeper of Maui.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A smart study of innocence and experience \u2026 Sarah Waters.

Working first as a waitress, then a cleaner and a nursing home aide, she still struggled to survive, and the stories of her co-workers are shocking. The US economy as she experienced it is full of routine humiliation, with demands as high as the rewards are low. Two decades on, this still reads like urgent news.\n\nRead the review\n\n12\n\nThe Plot Against America\n\nby Philip Roth (2004)\n\nWhat if aviator Charles Lindbergh, who once called Hitler \u201ca great man\u201d, had won the US presidency in a landslide victory and signed a treaty with Nazi Germany? Paranoid yet plausible, Roth\u2019s alternative-world novel is only more relevant in the age of Trump.\n\nRead the review\n\n11\n\nMy Brilliant Friend\n\nby Elena Ferrante (2011), translated by Ann Goldstein (2012)\n\nPowerfully intimate and unashamedly domestic, the first in Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan series established her as a literary sensation. This and the three novels that followed documented the ways misogyny and violence could determine lives, as well as the history of Italy in the late 20th century.\n\n10\n\nHalf of a Yellow Sun\n\nby Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (2006)\n\nWhen Nigerian author Adichie was growing up, the Biafran war \u201chovered over everything\u201d.

Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros Pictures/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar\n\n9\n\nCloud Atlas\n\nDavid Mitchell (2004)\n\nThe epic that made Mitchell\u2019s name is a Russian doll of a book, nesting stories within stories and spanning centuries and genres with aplomb. From a 19th-century seafarer to a tale from beyond the end of civilisation, via 1970s nuclear intrigue and the testimony of a future clone, these dizzying narratives are delicately interlinked, highlighting the echoes and recurrences of the vast human symphony.\n\nRead the review\n\n8\n\nAutumn\n\nby Ali Smith (2016)\n\nSmith began writing her Seasonal Quartet, a still-ongoing experiment in quickfire publishing, against the background of the EU referendum. The resulting \u201cfirst Brexit novel\u201d isn\u2019t just a snapshot of a newly divided Britain, but a dazzling exploration into love and art, time and dreams, life and death, all done with her customary invention and wit.\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A meditation on what it means to be a black American today \u2026 Ta-Nehisi Coates. Photograph: Shahar Azran/WireImage\n\n7\n\nBetween the World and Me\n\nby Ta-Nehisi Coates (2015)\n\nCoates\u2019s impassioned meditation on what it means to be a black American today made him one of the country\u2019s most important intellectuals and writers. Having grown up the son of a former Black Panther on the violent streets of Baltimore, he has a voice that is challenging but also poetic. Between the World and Me takes the form of a letter to his teenage son, and ranges from the daily reality of racial injustice and police violence to the history of slavery and the civil war: white people, he writes, will never remember \u201cthe scale of theft that enriched them\u201d.\n\nRead the review\n\n6\n\nThe Amber Spyglass\n\nby Philip Pullman (2000)\n\nChildren\u2019s fiction came of age when the final part of Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials trilogy became the first book for younger readers to win the Whitbread book of the year award. Pullman has brought imaginative fire and storytelling bravado to the weightiest of subjects: religion, free will, totalitarian structures and the human drive to learn, rebel and grow. Here Asriel\u2019s struggle against the Authority reaches its climax, Lyra and Will journey to the Land of the Dead, and Mary investigates the mysterious elementary particles that lend their name to his current trilogy: The Book of Dust. The Hollywood-fuelled commercial success achieved by JK Rowling may have eluded Pullman so far, but his sophisticated reworking of Paradise Lost helped adult readers throw off any embarrassment at enjoying fiction written for children \u2013 and publishing has never looked back.\n\nRead the review\n\n5\n\nAusterlitz\n\nby WG Sebald (2001), translated by Anthea Bell (2001)\n\nSebald died in a car crash in 2001, but his genre-defying mix of fact and fiction, keen sense of the moral weight of history and interleaving of inner and outer journeys have had a huge influence on the contemporary literary landscape. His final work, the typically allusive life story of one man, charts the Jewish disapora and lost 20th century with heartbreaking power.

His sixth novel, a love triangle set among human clones in an alternative 1990s England, brings exquisite understatement to its exploration of mortality, loss and what it means to be human.\n\nRead the review\n\n3\n\nSecondhand Time\n\nby Svetlana Alexievich (2013), translated by Bela Shayevich (2016)\n\nThe Belarusian Nobel laureate recorded thousands of hours of testimony from ordinary people to create this oral history of the Soviet Union and its end. Writers, waiters, doctors, soldiers, former Kremlin apparatchiks, gulag survivors: all are given space to tell their stories, share their anger and betrayal, and voice their worries about the transition to capitalism. An unforgettable book, which is both an act of catharsis and a profound demonstration of empathy.\n\n2\n\nGilead\n\nby Marilynne Robinson (2004)\n\nRobinson\u2019s meditative, deeply philosophical novel is told through letters written by elderly preacher John Ames in the 1950s to his young son who, when he finally reaches an adulthood his father won\u2019t see, will at least have this posthumous one-sided conversation: \u201cWhile you read this, I am imperishable, somehow more alive than I have ever been.\u201d This is a book about legacy, a record of a pocket of America that will never return, a reminder of the heartbreaking, ephemeral beauty that can be found in everyday life. As Ames concludes, to his son and himself: \u201cThere are a thousand thousand reasons to live this life, every one of them sufficient.\u201d\n\nRead the review\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hilary Mantel captures \u2018a sense of history listening and talking to itself\u2019.

To read her story of the rise of Thomas Cromwell at the Tudor court, detailing the making of a new England and the self-creation of a new kind of man, is to step into the stream of her irresistibly authoritative present tense and find oneself looking out from behind her hero\u2019s eyes. The surface details are sensuously, vividly immediate, the language as fresh as new paint; but her exploration of power, fate and fortune is also deeply considered and constantly in dialogue with our own era, as we are shaped and created by the past. In this book we have, as she intended, \u201ca sense of history listening and talking to itself\u201d.\n\nRead the review\n\n\u2022 To order any of these titles go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.
