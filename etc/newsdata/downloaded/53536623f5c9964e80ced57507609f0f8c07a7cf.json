I had spent 10 years writing about Ireland for Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal, and when the country\u2019s economy finally stabilized after the bottom had fallen out of both the housing market and the government\u2019s finances I upped and left. Seduced by television shows like \u201cFriends,\u201d which celebrates its 25th anniversary Friday, I was ready to write a new chapter.\n\nI had only ever visited New York, but I had an unrealistic and curated view of Manhattan life. I had consumed TV shows and movies (\u201cThe Last Days of Disco\u201d and \u201cSix Degrees of Separation\u201d) set in New York. I, on the other hand, grew up in a place where no one forgot how the Irish survived the famine. The 1980s and early 1990s were also a dark period of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, marked by an unending stream of terrorist attacks.\n\nBut there was also an aspirational Technicolor life on my childhood TV. We had four channels and they were crammed with all of life\u2019s parade: Lavish soap operas, comedies where the characters\u2019 problems were resolved in 30 minutes, and a story about a lovely lady and mother of three girls and stepmother to three boys in a house with one bathroom \u2014 plus, a live-in-housekeeper that middle-class Americans today could never afford.\n\nAniston was friendly, like her reputation. She is one of those celebrities you never hear anything bad about. \u2018You\u2019re from Oireland!\u2019 she said, doing a stage-Oirish accent. It made me laugh.\n\nIt seemed like everyone living in America was either middle-, upper-middle class, or filthy rich. By the time \u201cFriends\u201d arrived on my TV screen, I was sold. This was the land of Harvey Milk and money. I moved here for a new adventure, new challenges and, on a spiritual note, I believed there were wonderful friends waiting for me here \u2014 friends I had yet to meet. I have met many of those friends, and, eight years on, I can\u2019t imagine not knowing them.\n\nSomething else happened six months after arriving in New York: I was invited by an Irish friend to be a plus-one at a charity dinner in Gramercy Park. I put on the tuxedo that I had worn throughout Ireland\u2019s economic boom, known in Europe as the Celtic Tiger. As I stood around gabbing and sipping my drink, a friend said, \u201cJennifer Aniston walked through the door.\u201d This happens to all first-generation immigrants, right? What a nice introduction to New York!\n\nI wangled my way through the guests and, standing in the corner, there she was: Rachel Green, America\u2019s girl next door. I had long stopped watching reruns of \u201cFriends.\u201d I liked the show when it was on the air, but lately critics say the whitewashed comedy hasn\u2019t aged well. I feel about the \u201cFriends\u201d theme song the same way my Italian niece feels about the song from \u201cFrozen.\u201d I have listened to it so many times it makes me feel a little sick.\n\nThe people I watched on TV growing up, however, remain eternal stars. I was star-struck by Aniston. I appreciated the natural and self-deprecating nature of her comedy. Her performance in \u201cFriends\u201d never felt old. She was fully present. She never phoned it in. I also admired the way she navigated through a highly public divorce. She had dignity. I\u2019m not saying this because she opens up to Oprah and is friends with Ellen, but she also appeared to have a spiritual approach to life.\n\nI wish I could say the same for me in that moment. I introduced myself to Aniston and her friend. \u201cI\u2019m Quentin. I\u2019m from Ireland.\u201d Aniston was friendly, like her reputation. She is one of those celebrities you never hear anything bad about. \u201cYou\u2019re from Oireland!\u201d she said, doing a stage-Oirish accent. It made me laugh. We exchanged a few pleasantries and, thinking of the folks back home, I went in for the kill. \u201cCould we get a photo?\u201d Pause. \u201cFor my Facebook?\u201d\n\nAniston struck me as the kind of person who had mastered the art of healthy boundaries. She is someone who is comfortable saying no. She didn\u2019t need an out. Still, I had made it easy for her to wrap the conversation up. I had offered her an Irish exit on a tray in a giant steaming mug of coffee straight from Bewley\u2019s in Dublin or, better yet, Central Perk. \u201cI don\u2019t do Facebook,\u201d she replied. By mentioning social media, I made a fatal mistake.\n\nMarketWatch photo illustration/NBC With apologies to Matthew Perry: Quentin Fottrell, Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow and Jennifer Aniston.\n\nA two-minute celebrity-fan fail has given me a lot to chew over on the 25th anniversary of \u201cFriends.\u201d Ultimately, I appreciated the graceful way Aniston said no. She Hollywood-smiled me away. There was no room for negotiation. I\u2019m in bed by 10 p.m. and I\u2019m at work by eight, and I have no complaints. I went back to my table and told my cringeworthy tale to my mates. I did not get a photo with my favorite Friend, but I did get something far more valuable.\n\nI applied some humility to my burn, thanked Aniston and her friend for saying \u201chi\u201d to my \u201chi,\u201d and walked sideways like a lobster back to my table. Of course, she doesn\u2019t do Facebook, I realized. She, of all people, has had enough exposure to our society\u2019s toxic media. Facebook \u201cfriends\u201d giving her their precious thr\u2019pence-worth on the latest development in her world is the last thing she needs in her life. Who in their right mind would open themselves up to more?\n\nWell, 2.4 billion people around the globe, to be exact. That\u2019s 2.4 billion people who want to stay connected, as Facebook FB, -0.11% Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg likes to say. Or 2.4 billion people who like to present a happy, smug and frequently false version of their lives. Or 2.4 billion people who like to bounce around in their own echo chambers. Both Facebook and \u201cFriends\u201d offer us a sense of belonging and, for a few minutes or hours, they appear to deliver.\n\nFacebook \u2018friends\u2019 giving Aniston their precious thr\u2019pence-worth on the latest development in her world is the last thing she needs. Who in their right mind would open themselves up to more?\n\nToo much screen time is bad for your health. Studies suggest there is a link between Facebook and depression and say lonely people share too much on Facebook. My Aniston photo would have been the 21st Century equivalent of first-generation immigrants who wear borrowed formal clothes, and send postcards home to make them look successful and wealthy. They say, \u201cLook mom \u2014 I made it!\u201d At its best, Facebook allows me to stay in touch with friends and family.\n\nI have never forgotten Aniston\u2019s lesson in maintaining her privacy. She was way ahead of her time. Most people on social media experience peer pressure and contend with ill-judged comments from Facebook friends on a daily basis. When I shared an apartment in a Georgian building in Dublin with a college friend in my 20s, she gave three valuable pieces of advice for such situations, \u201cDon\u2019t respond. Don\u2019t respond. Don\u2019t respond.\u201d\n\nAniston also taught me about the intersection of reality and celebrity culture. This was not a famous face brought into my life by the benevolent gods of New York City to bestow on me the realization that I made the right decision to move to New York. I was just another presumptuous schmo lumbering up to her to capture the moment. This actor who waitressed on the Upper West Side where I now live before \u201cFriends,\u201d had likely rebuffed thousands before me.\n\nMy brief interaction with Aniston at a restaurant in Gramercy Park is a timely reminder that shiny, happy people who appear on our TVs and in movies are just like you and me. Aniston, to her credit, showed that the familiar strangers who might approach us in restaurants or on the street deserve the same respect, too. It\u2019s also a reminder that the U.S. is a celebrity-obsessed culture and one in which the worlds of reality TV, tabloids, politics and economics collide.\n\n\u201cFriends\u201d was a fantasy. It\u2019s important not to forget that. Most people today probably know the \u201cFriends\u201d characters couldn\u2019t have afforded to live in Monica (Courtney Cox) and Rachel\u2019s spacious West Village loft apartment. In the second season viewers were told the apartment was rent-controlled and Monica inherited it from her grandmother. The monthly rent for a small two-bedroom hovered at $2,500 or less in 1994. Today, it costs $3,500, an increase of 40%.\n\nAmerica\u2019s middle class has, in fact, been shrinking for years. The cost of maintaining our lifestyles, as seen on TV, has been overtaken by the cost of living. Household income was $52,942 in 1994, the year \u201cFriends\u201d premiered. Last year, it was $63,179, an increase of 19%. U.S. price inflation has soared 73% over the same period. The Rembrandts\u2019 \u201cFriends\u201d theme could be rewritten for 2019: I\u2019ll be there for you. Will you be there for me when I retire?", "description": "\u2018Friends\u2019 celebrates its 25th anniversary, but the actress who played Rachel Green was way ahead of her time.", "authors": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR784_quenti_ZG_20190920151640.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
