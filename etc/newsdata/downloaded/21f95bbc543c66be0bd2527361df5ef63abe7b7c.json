It was the occasion when rising English tyros would seek to hold their own against two Australian icons. They did far more than that.\n\nEddie Jones' so-called 'Kamikaze Kids' utterly up-staged the pair dubiously referred to as 'Pooper'; David Pocock and Michael Hooper.\n\nEngland's 'Kamikaze Kids' Sam Underhill and Tom Curry starred during their World Cup win\n\nHaving been selected together again by their head coach, Curry and Underhill had spoken in almost deferential fashion about their Wallaby rivals \u2013 both supreme opensides \u2013 who they had looked up to growing up.\n\nSo they paid their respects by playing them off the park.\n\nIt was a reversal of recent history. Four years ago, Pocock and Hooper had been at the heart of Australia's emphatic 33-13 pool-stage win over England at Twickenham, to condemn the hosts to an early exit from their own tournament.\n\nMichael Hooper and David Pocock could not replicate their heroics from four years ago\n\nThe Red Rose team of 2019 were wary of their enduring threat, but they negated it superbly.\n\nEarly on, Pocock did what Pocock has always done; he won a crucial turnover in front of his own line, to halt an English raid and earn his team a vital reprieve.\n\nBut it was no statement-of-intent intervention. Instead, it was a false portent of what was to follow.\n\nThe Kamikaze Kids took over and they bestrode the grand event. Curry was named Man of the Match and that was a fitting tribute. His contribution was astonishing to behold.\n\nThe youngest forward to ever represent England at a World Cup is rapidly making a name for himself out here in the Far East.\n\nDavid Pocock running at Tom Curry during England's Rugby World Cup match with Australia\n\nHe is an all-action figure; a rugby all-rounder. In the 18th minute, he was on hand to deliver the scoring pass for Jonny May's first try.\n\nHe stayed composed, drew the last defender and sent the wing over. Moments later, in contrast, it was Pocock's loose pass near halfway which Henry Slade snatched to set up May's second try.\n\nJust after the half-hour, there was a striking illustration of Curry's impact and the dynamism that these flankers have given this England team.\n\nThe blindside won a ruck turnover in his own half and was soon up on his feet, chasing an Owen Farrell kick ahead. Seconds later, as Reece Hodge ran the ball back, he was flattened by Curry with a textbook tackle.\n\nTom Curry was awarded man of the match after making an astonishing contribution\n\nSure enough, there was Underhill, also up in support, forcing himself over the ball as England were awarded a scrum. Team-mates swarmed over to congratulate their flankers. The head-slapping celebrations summed up the collective appreciation for their work.\n\nUnderhill went on to make 20 tackles before he was replaced with 12 minutes remaining, but he and his side-kick did far more than just accumulate healthy statistics.\n\nThey both make hits that reverberate. They don't just stop opponents, they obliterate them. Underhill demolished Wallaby No 8 Isi Naisarani at waist height \u2013 hurling him backwards.\n\nNot so long ago, these Kamikaze Kids were regarded as rivals, both tussling for the openside berth.\n\nBut Curry has adapted well to wearing the No 6 and they have dovetailed instinctively, as was clear when they first operated in tandem, against Ireland in August.\n\nTheir contribution was not just a destructive one either \u2013 that day at Twickenham or here in Oita. They both carry the ball strongly and Curry in particular handles well in confined spaces.\n\nEngland will now play either New Zealand or Ireland in the World Cup semi-finals\n\nThey eclipsed Pooper and fulfilled their objectives. 'In the game now, everyone is expected to do everything,' Underhill had said, in reference to modern-day Test back-rowers.\n\nCurry had set his sights on the Australian icons, adding: 'We spoke about what Hooper and Pocock did at the last World Cup; the amount of turnovers. You got out every week first and foremost for the team, but also to beat your opposite man.'\n\nMission accomplished. This was the day the apprentices left the masters trailing.", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN OITA: In what was a masters-versus-apprentice contest.
