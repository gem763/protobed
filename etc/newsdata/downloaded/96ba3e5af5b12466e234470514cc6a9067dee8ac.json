USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES - When LeBron James gets off a plane in China on Tuesday, he better be ready.\n\nReporters surely will be waiting.\n\nFor the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nFor the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nBut especially for LeBron.

(Photo: Kelvin Kuo, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThere should be no appearance of equivocation from LeBron, delicate as the situation might be. He is Nike\u2019s best compensated and most globally recognized pitchman, and Nike does big business in China. How big?\n\nIn the most recent quarter, Nike\u2019s Great China revenue increased by 22% to almost $1.7 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. In early 2016, not long after James signed a lifetime endorsement deal with Nike reported to be worth $1 billion, he had made 12 trips to China for Nike, according to cleveland.com.\n\nOPINION: NBA commissioner Adam Silver has no winning play on China\n\nFinancial pressure may test the depth of LeBron\u2019s commitment to social issues outside the United States and a commendable off-the-court reputation he has earned by doing the following:\n\n\u25baDonning a hooded sweatshirt in 2012 after the death of Trayvon Martin, an African American teenager who wore a hooded sweatshirt when he was shot to death by a white neighborhood crime-watch volunteer.\n\n\u25baCriticizing President Trump for divisive politics and saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna let ... one individual no matter the power, no matter the impact that he should have or she should have, ever use sports as a platform to divide us.\u201d\n\n\u25baSupporting Colin Kaepernick in his protesting of racism and police brutality and once telling the Los Angeles Times, \"I think with Kap, I stand with Kap, I kneel with Kap.\u201d\n\n\u25baLamenting hate in America before the start of the 2017 NBA Finals after a gate outside his home was vandalized with the N-word.\n\nAnd, most recently, speaking out in favor of the new California law that will allow college athletes to be paid for use of their name, image and likeness. He even had California Gov. Gavin Newsome on his HBO show, The Shop, where LeBron, in his own words, likes to chop it up while discussing important social issues.\n\nNow\u2019s the time to chop it up again.\n\nOppression in Hong Kong is an issue that deserves LeBron\u2019s considered view.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Josh Peter on Twitter @joshlpeter11", "description": "If LeBron James wants to preserve his reputation as an athlete willing to risk backlash while speaking out, he must support free speech and society.", "authors": ["Josh Peter", "Published P.M.
