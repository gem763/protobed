Matt Gaetz asked the House ethics committee to open an investigation of Rep. Adam Schiff, accusing the California Democrat of lying to the public.\n\nThe Florida Republican took to Twitter to post the letter he sent to the Democrat-led panel outlining his case for an investigation and demanding that \u201cSchiff must be held accountable.\u201d\n\nThe complaint accused Mr. Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, of distorting President Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, of lying about the investigation into Russia\u2019s 2016 election meddling and of keeping Mr. Gaetz and other members of Congress out of a non-public impeachment hearing.\n\n\u201cChairman Schiff has abused his authority and seems to believe that the rules of the House of Representatives do not apply to him,\u201d Mr. Gaetz said in a separate statement. \u201cWe cannot have a multi-tiered justice system in the United States or in the Congress. His egregious behavior must change immediately.\u201d\n\nThe request will almost certainly fall on deaf ears, as both parties in the House have dug in their partisan heels on matters related to Mr. Trump, impeachment, relations with Ukraine and Russia, and the investigations thereof.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think anyone takes Mr. Gaetz seriously, especially on the subject of ethics,\u201d Patrick Boland, a spokesman for Mr. Schiff, said in a statement to Fox News.\n\nIn his letter to the Ethics panel, Mr. Gaetz noted that during an Intelligence committee hearing in September, Mr. Schiff \u201cgave a wildly-inaccurate and distorted \u2018retelling\u2019\u201d of the phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky.\n\nMr. Schiff claimed his recounting of the conversation was a parody. But he did not label it that at the time and only pleaded satirical intent after having been called on its falseness, prompting some conservative news outlets to say Mr. Schiff was trying to create \u201cfacts\u201d and a narrative that would shape everything else before he\u2019d have to walk it back.\n\nMr. Gaetz\u2019s note also cited Mr. Schiff\u2019s repeated claims throughout the investigation into Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election that he had \u201cmore than circumstantial evidence\u201d that the Trump campaign was \u201ccolluding\u201d with the Kremlin.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller found no such evidence.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
