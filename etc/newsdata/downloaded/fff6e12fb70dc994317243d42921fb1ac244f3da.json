Rushmore for Speakers, @SpeakerPelosi would be on it. This picture: a strong, calm, confident woman standing up to Trump, is iconic. She makes me proud to be a Democrat. https://t.co/1yriQlKriQ \u2014 Paul Begala (@PaulBegala) October 17, 2019\n\nThe White House meeting came soon after the House overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan resolution condemning Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, all but clearing the way for Turkey to invade territory held by the U.S.-allied Kurds.\n\nPelosi said she told Trump that Russia has been trying to get a foothold in the Middle East and his troop withdrawal gives them an opening as Kurds reach out to Russians for support.\n\nPutin also benefited when Trump placed doubts at the beginning of his administration on the U.S.'s commitment to NATO, she said.\n\nAnd Pelosi said she told Trump that any withholding of U.S. assistance to Ukraine helps Russia, which invaded its neighboring country in 2014.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry Pelosi launched last month centers on whether military aid to Ukraine was delayed by Trump to encourage Ukraine's newly-elected leader to investigate Joe Biden and a conspiracy theory involving interference in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi gestures while speaking during a news conference on Capitol Hill on Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019.
