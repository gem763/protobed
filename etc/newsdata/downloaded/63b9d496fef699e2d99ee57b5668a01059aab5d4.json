United, the stats aren\u2019t pretty but the results matter more", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nSteve Birnbaum (15) and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Brillant, here battling with LA Galaxy star Zlatan Ibrahimovic last month, have anchored a defense that is among the best in MLS. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nFrom a statistical standpoint, D.C. United\u2019s past two matches were a disaster.\n\nOpponents compiled massive advantages in shots (47-14) and possession (66.5 percent), leaving the burdened visitors chasing shadows and pinned in their own end for exhausting stretches.\n\nThe only numbers that mattered, though, were on the scoreboard: 3-0 and 1-0, critical victories at Montreal and Portland that extinguished concern about qualifying for the MLS playoffs and reinforced Coach Ben Olsen\u2019s defensive ideals.\n\nThe other key figures: Despite the one-sided shot total, the Impact and Timbers managed just four apiece on goal against a unit that blocked shots and forced attempts from outside the penalty area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to know we can be one of the better defensive teams in the league if we need to be in that structure, which is a little disrespected at times,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cThere is an art to defending, and these guys put a lot of work in and made a lot of tactical decisions to solve problems and keep the ball out of the net.\u201d\n\n[Wayne Rooney or Ola Kamara: D.C. United will face a decision]\n\nIf United is to make a postseason run, it\u2019s probably not going to go through stylish, attack-geared soccer. It\u2019s going to be by absorbing pressure, bending but not breaking and taking advantage of precious opportunity.\n\nIt\u2019s not a pretty form of the sport, one often derided by foes and fans alike. But for United (12-10-9, 45 points), that inelegant style got the job done after three consecutive defeats and kept the team in the hunt for home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThree regular season matches remain, starting Sunday night at Audi Field against the Seattle Sounders (14-9-8, 50 points).\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s not about the beautiful soccer,\u201d said defensive midfielder Felipe Martins, whose acquisition last month brought experience and grit. \u201cEveryone wants to play beautiful, but sometimes when you win playing that solidly, it\u2019s more satisfying because we have to work so hard for it.\u201d\n\nUnited entered the weekend tied for fourth in fewest goals conceded (38) despite facing the second-most shots (538) and fifth-most shots on target (162). Goalkeeper Bill Hamid is second in shutouts (11), and the team goalkeeping is first in save percentage (74.2).\n\nOffensively, with the team struggling to re-create the crackling form it exhibited during the second half of the 2018 season, United has enjoyed more possession just 12 times and is in the bottom six in goals, assists, shots and corner kicks.\n\nHence, the heightening emphasis on defense.\n\nIn a 2-1 victory over the Los Angeles Galaxy last month, D.C. conceded 70 percent of possession while allowing 29 shots. Only four, though, were on goal.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to talk about possession and how much attack [opponents] have,\u201d Olsen said, \u201cbut we got three points.\u201d\n\nWith the playoffs approaching, Olsen seems to have settled on his defensive corps after tinkering throughout the year: Hamid in net, with Steve Birnbaum and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Brillant at center back, flanked by Joseph Mora and Russell Canouse, a traditional midfielder who, on short notice, has been converted into a right back.\n\nMartins and J\u00fanior Moreno form the defensive-midfield partnership. The other midfielders \u2014 Paul Arriola, Lucas Rodr\u00edguez and Ulises Segura \u2014 have been given greater defensive responsibility, such as tracking back and disrupting forays.\n\nWith few opportunities to exhale, United has been tested mentally.\n\n\u201cIt is hard, especially for our back line,\u201d Birnbaum said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a good job being tuned in and covering each other\u2019s backs. There\u2019s no excuses that guys should be turning off at all in these games. The coaching staff prepared us in the right way to be able to stay focused throughout those 90 minutes.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of two shutouts, though, \u201ccan we push the offensive side a little bit and find that balance?\u201d Olsen asked. \u201cThat\u2019s the challenge we face.\u201d\n\nLeading scorer Wayne Rooney is trying to regain his form after missing several matches for various reasons; he has scored once since July 1, a span of eight appearances. Playmaker Luciano Acosta lost his starting job amid low production and Olsen\u2019s defensive demands from all players.\n\nLast weekend, the difference against Portland was a first-half own goal.\n\nUnited\u2019s defensive expertise will make it a difficult team to oust from the playoffs, which, with a format change, has been reduced to single matches in every round. A stout defensive effort over 90 minutes \u2014 or, if necessary, 120 \u2014 could contribute to more upsets.\n\n\u201cWe have done that many times this season,\u201d Rooney said of succeeding with a defense-first tactic. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen we can do it and get the rewards for it. It\u2019s obviously not how everyone wants to play, but if you know you have to do that to get through a game, then we are ready to go.\u201d\n\nSeattle Sounders at D.C.
