Or horror story? Next 12 will write ending to Nationals' story", "language": "en", "text": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nWe are nearing the last chapter of the Washington Nationals\u2019 2019 season \u2014 which could wind up a fairy tale. Or a horror story.\n\nThe fairy tale would be about a bunch of superstars who inexplicably stumbled through the first two months of the season to a 19-31 record, prompting calls for manager Dave Martinez\u2019s job and fueling delusional talk of trading future Hall of Fame pitcher Max Scherzer for \u201cprospects.\u201d\n\nBut in this inspirational story, the stars slowly but surely, over the course of a 162-game season, remember how to win, thanks in part to the heart of their loyal manager, Martinez, who never wavered in support of his team and showed players how to stick together during fractured times.\n\nA team that looked like an also-ran early on becomes Cinderella \u2014 leading the major leagues with a 59-28 record over the next 88 games into September. And, though Cinderella finishes the regular season ball without reeling in the NL East division-leading Atlanta Braves, she seems to be a team primed to wear the glass slipper in the MLB postseason.\n\nThat was the fairy tale in the making.\n\nThere\u2019s another ending in the works, though, one that doesn\u2019t end with \u201chappily ever after.\u201d\n\nIn the Stephen King version of the Nationals\u2019 season, the slump to start the year is bookended by an even uglier collapse at the end. Cinderella doesn\u2019t get the glass slipper, or make the playoffs or even hang on to Prince Charming \u2014 a.k.a. MVP candidate and future free agent Anthony Rendon.\n\nThat\u2019s the nightmare.\n\nIt all comes down to the final 12 games \u2014 the series finale Wednesday against the NL Central division-leading St. Louis Cardinals; three games in Miami against the Marlins, then eight games at home \u2014 five against the Philadelphia Phillies and a three-game series with the Cleveland Indians, who may be fighting for their own AL wild-card spot in that final weekend.\n\nThe Nationals, after going 3-10 in their last 13 games before Tuesday\u2019s night contest against the Cardinals, are barely hanging on to a place in the wild-card race with the Chicago Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers. Somehow, geek websites like Fangraphs gave Washington a 91% chance of making the postseason.\n\nIf, at the end of this season, the Nationals will have survived with a chance to play in a wild-card playoff game, the odds they will have overcome are far more than that. They\u2019ll have done so with the health of their manager in question and a bullpen without one single shutdown arm to call on.\n\nMartinez, 54, left the Nationals dugout Sunday while his team was on its way to a 7-0 win over the Braves at Nationals Park.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t feeling well and was taken to a local hospital for testing. That has since developed into a hospital stay that included a cardiac catheterization, a test to determine how strong your heart is.\n\nGeneral manager Mike Rizzo told reporters Tuesday that Martinez is back at his D.C. home and no further tests are needed. Rizzo said he expects Martinez to be cleared to travel, but won\u2019t be heading to St. Louis.\n\nWhen Martinez was hospitalized, I thought back to June, when he told me before a game he did a workout that consisted of turning over a truck tire 100 times \u2014 sort of like how managing these Nationals this season has been. Turning that tire over day after day takes a toll.\n\nI also thought of the day before Martinez had to leave for the hospital \u2014 the day that Atlanta\u2019s Charlie Culberson was hit in the face by a Fernando Rodney pitch and suffered multiple facial fractures.\n\nMartinez was upset that home plate umpire Tim Timmons described a scene in which, while Culberson was on the ground being treated by trainers, Martinez called the umpire over and asked him to check to see if Culberson offered on a bunt attempt.\n\nMartinez wouldn\u2019t tell reporters what the conversation was, only to say that it \u201cwasn\u2019t the way it was portrayed to be\u201d by Timmons. The manager was reportedly visibly upset by the situation, and told reporters, \u201cThe last thing I wanted to do was be a jackass.\u201d\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Martinez, well-respected throughout the game, was on his way to the hospital.\n\nOf course, the top priority here is the health of Martinez. But it\u2019s difficult to imagine Washington fighting through these final 12 games without their emotional leader.\n\nAfter Monday night\u2019s 4-2 loss to St. Louis, starter Stephen Strasburg, who struggled early but managed to keep the game at 2-2 after five innings, told reporters, \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to stick together.\u201d\n\nThat is the story Dave Martinez has been writing all year.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
