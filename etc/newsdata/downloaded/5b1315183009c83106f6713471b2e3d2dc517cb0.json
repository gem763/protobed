Note none of her friends seems perturbed at all.\n\n'She seems in good spirits and did not leave the club once in the 2 hours 55 minutes of attendance. Nor did she seek help or assistance from any of the 14 staff on duty.'\n\nMr Scott early on Monday morning he posted CCTV of Ms Smith entering the leaving the club to support his claim that her drink was never spiked\n\nMr Scott has been vilified for posting the CCTV footage online with hundreds of angry punters threatening to boycott the venue.\n\n'Regardless if this young girl was in fact spiked at your club is besides the point. You victimised and humiliated her,' one woman wrote.\n\n'Her first message to you wasn\u2019t even her trying to get anything out of it,' a second woman added.\n\n'It was just to make you aware of what happened and to try and prevent it happening to someone else! Your response back to her is why everyone\u2019s mad! These videos prove nothing except that you\u2019re a terrible person.'\n\nOne man noted Mr Scott's 'doubling down' on his original response was doing no favours for him or his business.\n\n'A legitimate concern was raised in a rational manner and someone in your organization - be it you or not, elected to respond in a crass, unprofessional and somewhat bizarrely defensive way,' he wrote.\n\n'Instead of addressing your organisation's mistaken handling of this, you personally have now doubled down... making it even worse for yourselves. Weird flex.'\n\nMs Smith claimed to have been unconscious and throwing up for two and a half hours after her first drink at Rapture.\n\nVictims of GHB and other 'date rape' drugs usually only feel the effects for about three hours, or potentially less if they vomit some of it before it is absorbed.\n\nMr Scott also mocked homeless people sleeping on the street near the club in photos posted to his page earlier this year\n\nMr Scott's personal Facebook posts include numerous anti-Islamic memes and a since-deleted anti-gay screed about the same-sex marriage plebiscite.\n\n'So happy to be able to vote against gay marriage. The gay community are so vociferous, that good people are shouted down and vilified for having an opposing view to them,' he wrote in September 2017.\n\n'For the sake of freedom of speech alone, I would have to vote 'NO'. Anal sex is wrong and children need a father and a mother. That's another reason for voting NO.'\n\nMr Scott also mocked homeless people sleeping on the street near the club in photos posted to his page earlier this year.\n\nFormer staff who claimed to have worked for Mr Smith at Rapture and other clubs made further allegations about his conduct.\n\nAnother conversation soon emerged showing the club making a disgusting comment to a woman who asked about the dress code.\n\n'Hey are black sweatpants acceptable to wear?' she asked.\n\n'If you get stopped at the door, just take them off. I'm sure that will be ok. Make sure you wear a gstring,' the club's Facebook page replied.\n\nAnother conversation soon emerged allegedly showing the nightclub making a disgusting comment to a woman who asked about the dress code\n\nMs Smith said she visited Rapture, in Perth's Northbridge entertainment district, on Saturday night and believes someone slipped something into her drink.\n\n'The response I received was absolutely disgusting after the message I sent them was extremely polite and just requesting they increase their security,' she said.\n\nMs Smith said she only had two or three drinks before arriving and only had one drink inside before she became unwell.\n\n'I was then unconscious for the next two and a half hours, vomiting, and experiencing other common symptoms of a date rape drug,' she said.\n\nMs Smith said she didn't see any bouncers near the bar and suggested the club beef up its security to protect its reputation.\n\nMs Smith, the victim, posted the response to Instagram and the social media pages of both Rapture and Mr Scott were bombarded with negative comments\n\nWhen she reported the alleged incident to the venue, Rapture Nightclub in Perth, it sent her this response instead of apologising\n\nWhat Ms Smith sent Rapture's Facebook page after her night out that prompted Mr Scott's response\n\nInstead of addressing her concerns or apologising for what allegedly happened, the club instead fired back.\n\n'Why would anyone want to spike your drink? Did you attend a hospital and have your stomach pumped for evidence?' the response read.\n\n'Is this something you and your friends experience regularly? Would you like a crowd controller to hold your drink for you next time you attend a nightclub?\n\n'Do you think ten crowd controllers would be able to stop you having your drink spiked?\n\n'Are you worth someone trying to spike your drink?\n\n'We think this is a beat up and we believe that no one would be stupid enough to waste their drugs on spiking anyone's drink.'\n\nMr Scott has been vilified for posting the CCTV footage online with hundreds of angry punters threatening to boycott the venue.\n\nRapture is in Perth's Northbridge entertainment district and its Facebook page was soon bombarded with hundreds of negative reviews\n\nMs Smith was astonished by the reply to what was a polite, if unhappy, complaint and posted the message on social media.\n\nRapture's Facebook page was soon bombarded with hundreds of negative reviews slamming the club's response.\n\nA petition was even launched to shut down the club and turn the building into a homeless shelter or women's refuge.", "description": "Neil Temple Scott, 66, ridiculed Shantel Smith, 19, when she complained to Rapture Nightclub in Perth that her drink was spiked on Saturday night, calling her claims a 'beat up'.", "authors": ["Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/00/19374974-0-image-a-137_1570405496734.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
