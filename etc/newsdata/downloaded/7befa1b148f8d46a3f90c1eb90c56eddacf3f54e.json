German budget has a 2% surplus each year but Germany will not spend some of it on stimulus to reduce recession risk due to declining exports of cars to China and rest of the world.\n\nAll bond market is telling us is that investors cannot get 2% yield anywhere else in the global markets.", "description": "3 Mo. - 30Yr.
