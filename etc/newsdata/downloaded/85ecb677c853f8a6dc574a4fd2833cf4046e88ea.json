The infection rate rose 3 percent from 2017.\n\nIt\u2019s the most ever reported in a year, though the trend is mainly attributed to increased testing.\n\nAbout 580,000 gonorrhea cases were reported. That\u2019s the highest number since 1991. The rate rose 5 percent. Scientists worry antibiotic resistance may be a factor.\n\nAnd the syphilis rate rose 15 percent. About 35,000 cases of the most contagious forms of the disease were reported \u2014 also the most since 1991.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the numbers Tuesday.\n\nThe increases coincided with public health funding cuts and clinic closures.", "description": "Chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis cases have increased for the fifth consecutive year, reported The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9cbad52000003a064f8129.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
