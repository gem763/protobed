Thrown off by the odd-looking nature of the fish, the angler took a picture and threw it back into the water, according to The New York Times. After reporting it to a state biologist, a team went back out on the water and found a two-foot snakehead fish and three juveniles.\n\nsnakehead fish More\n\nThe northern snakehead fish has reportedly been found in 15 US states, according to the Georgia Wildlife Resources Division, though they are native to waters in Asia and Africa.\n\nIn two years, a female snakehead fish can release up to 150,000 eggs, but without a competing predator outside its natural habitat to keep its population in check, the land-dwelling fish can pose a threat to local animals.\n\n\"They are a predator that eats mostly other fish, but also amphibians, small animals, frogs, lizards,\" Scott Robinson from the Wildlife Resources Division told The Times. \"It will compete with our native species for food and habitat.\"\n\nSnakehead fish survive in freshwater, The Times reported. They can grow up to three feet long and breathe air, allowing them to survive on land. The fish travel by tossing their bodies side-to-side \u2014 an equivalent to walking \u2014 according to National Geographic.\n\nRead more: The Asian Snakehead Fish That Was Found In Maryland Is Aggressive And Spreading\n\nsnakehead frankenfish More\n\nREUTERS/Gary Cameron\n\nWhat to do if you find a snakehead fish\n\nGeorgia officials advise residents to not release snakehead fish if you come across them.
