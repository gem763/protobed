Dumb ass bitch, reporting for work. After climbing through the thicket of social media insults that regularly starts the day of a woman in a sportsman\u2019s business, I sat down to read Antonio Brown\u2019s alleged text messages to a young woman who is accusing him of rape. It\u2019s of course impossible to tell from the lawsuit, filed the day after he signed with the New England Patriots, whether he\u2019s guilty of that crime. But if those texts are his, he most assuredly is guilty of using language that countenances it, and now he\u2019s in the position of trying to explain that it was just words.\n\nYou want to be thought of as a good man falsely accused? Then don\u2019t talk like a crude, rapacious brute. Find a different expression. Search out an articulacy, something other than the tongue-tied dead-end vulgar cough that is the word \u201cbitch.\u201d She\u2019s a \u201clien bitch thought it was easy to get a come up.\u201d She\u2019s a \u201cweak bitch\u201d and a \u201cfake hoe.\u201d She and her mother, too, are \u201cdum ass hoes.\u201d This isn\u2019t innocent language. To employ the phrase of Toni Morrison, it\u2019s \u201cmutant language designed to throttle women.\u201d\n\nYou want the benefit of the doubt? Try talking less like a cut from \u201cA Bitch Iz A Bitch,\u201d and more like New England Patriots tight end Benjamin Watson, who just reduced Laura Ingraham to stammering in a television debate with well-stated facts. Every time I hear Watson speak or read one of his excellent blogs, I feel an overwhelming relief that reminds me of what Morrison wrote in her eulogy of James Baldwin: \u201cIn your hands language was handsome again.\u201d\n\n[NFL mulls whether to make Brown ineligible to play]\n\nOn Tuesday, I congratulated Brown for having the smarts and self-control and self-determination to get himself to the Patriots, as opposed to letting himself be powerlessly trapped on a bad team. Today, after reading the messages included in the lawsuit filed by his accuser, I feel compelled to state that I don\u2019t know who Brown really is. I can only hope he\u2019s innocent. But what I do know is that I\u2019m sick of athletes (and their worshipers) who apparently never learned a primary language beyond misogyny, a language that treats women as punchable sex dolls, and excuses violence because the hoe had it coming.\n\nI don\u2019t know the first thing about Britney Taylor, either, whether she\u2019s a victim or an ex looking for a settlement \u2014 Brown\u2019s lawyer says the relationship was consensual and she wanted the player to invest $1.6 million in a business project. What I do know is that language matters. As Rebecca Solnit has written, \u201cWhen you turn \u2018torture\u2019 into \u2018enhanced interrogation\u2019 . . . you break the power of language to convert meaning, to make us see, feel, and care.\u2019\u201d A fifth of all the \u201cbitches\u201d in America are raped. Feel that. Approximately 1,500 \u201cbitches\u201d a year are killed by male partners, and studies show that prostitution, or \u201choeing\u201d in his parlance, is the riskiest occupation in the United States when it comes to violence. Feel it.\n\n[Jerry Brewer: It\u2019s Antonio Brown\u2019s NFL and we\u2019re just living in it]\n\nFor decades now I\u2019ve written about pro athletes with an interest and respect that borders on reverence, and always wanted to err sympathetically on their side \u2014 for their ability to turn themselves over so completely to a craft, and yet their susceptibility to being used. For their exquisite physical precision and ephemeral beauty, and yet their propensity to get burned up by others. But I\u2019ve never reconciled myself to the clumsy, casual \u201call my bitches\u201d way so many of them talk, and the implacable coldness of their refusal to acknowledge the pervasive, contagious damage they do with it.\n\nLanguage is a projection of personal quality. The language of \u201cbitches\u201d and \u201choes\u201d that so many great athletes use is exactly what it appears to be \u2014 a menacing unfeelingness, a limitedness of expression that bespeaks something insensate, a hardheartedness and determination to subjugate. This kind of language, Morrison said in her epic Nobel Prize lecture, \u201cis ruthless in its policing duties, it has no desire or purpose other than maintaining the free range of its own narcotic narcissism, its own exclusivity and dominance.\u201d It is a profound failure that bespeaks nothing but thwartedness, thoughtlessness, an incapability to form even a sentence. It entraps everybody and prevents any kind of progress or understanding, and it\u2019s as imprisoning for the speaker as much as the target.\n\nI\u2019ll leave it for Morrison, a far superior and more expressive writer, to finish off the thought. \u201cUnreceptive to interrogation, it cannot form or tolerate new ideas, shape other thoughts, tell another story, fill baffling silences.\u201d This dead-end language, she compares to a medieval \u201csuit of armor polished to shocking glitter.\u201d It is \u201ca husk from which the knight departed long ago,\u201d she writes. \u201cYet there it is: dumb, predatory, sentimental.\u201d", "description": "Too many athletes routinely use crude, violent language about women without acknowledging the pervasive, contagious damage it does", "authors": ["Sally Jenkins", "Sports Columnist", "September At Pm", "Sally Jenkins Is A Sports Columnist For The Washington Post.
