Steph Blackwell had been vying to become the first contestant in the history of the show to be Star Baker four weeks running.\n\nShe narrowly missed out (due to Henry) but when she promptly won it for her fourth time in the next episode, it meant only one person in the ten series of GBBO had been awarded Star Baker more than she had.\n\nWell done: David Atherton became the first Great British Bake Off champion who had never been Star Baker on Tuesday evening\n\nIn 2015 Richard Burr had been Star Baker five times but only come third. But like Richard and so many leading contenders, Steph failed to win the big one \u2013 and in spectacular fashion too with two of the three Challenges proving calamitous.\n\nSo her early successes counted for nothing. In fact, statistically, the \u2018honour\u2019 counted against her.\n\nOnly once in nine years had the contestant who\u2019d been Star Baker more times than any of their rivals then gone on to be champion: Candice Brown, in 2017.\n\nHopes dashed: The curse of Star Baker struck again in the final of The Great British Bake Off as show favourite Steph Blackwell lost out to winner David\n\nNearly all the \u2018best\u2019 Bakers during the other series (like Ruby Tandoh, James Morton, or Steven Carter-Bailey) were destined/doomed to finish as Runners-Up, losing out to someone with a couple of titles at most (such as Sophie Faldo or Rahul Mandal).\n\nFour of the eventual winners had been Star Baker only once, which meant in eight of the nine weeks someone else had been superior.\n\nDavid Atherton went one better, becoming the first GBBO champion who had never been Star Baker.\n\nSo he had a fair point when he declared at the start:\n\n\u2018I\u2019m definitely the underdog!\u2019\n\nVictor: There\u2019s no doubt David deserved to win but was also helped by his opponents, particularly Steph who cracked/collapsed under pressure\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt he deserved to win but was also helped by his opponents, particularly Steph who cracked/collapsed under pressure.\n\nAlice did far better (particularly in the Showstopper) but lost out to David in the Technical round when her \u2018twice-baked Stilton souffl\u00e9s\u2019 were, in the words of Paul Hollywood, \u2018too gluey.\u2019\n\nAnd as he said tried her chocolate cake in the Signature Challenge: \u2018I\u2019m lacking the chocolate.\u2019\n\nA real case of: you had one job\u2026.\n\nNearly, but not quite: Alice did far better (particularly in the Showstopper) but lost out to David in the Technical round\n\n... when her \u2018twice-baked Stilton souffl\u00e9s\u2019 were, in the words of Paul Hollywood, \u2018too gluey'\n\nFor reasons best known to herself she had made a chocolate cake that tasted of pears, maple cream cheese, and ginger.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a bit wobbly and clumsy,\u2019 tutted Prue too.\n\nAs usual, it all came down to Showstopper \u2013 \u2018a deliciously deceptive picnic\u2019 where the Bakers\u2019 creations had to look like something else.\n\n\u2018They could make a bread roll look like a pork pie,\u2019 Hollywood explained, for example. \u2018Or a cake that looks like a banana.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yuck!\u2019 you thought, or more precisely: \u2018why?\u2019\n\nHollywood hailed David\u2019s picnic as \u2018amazing\u2019, \u2018stunning\u2019, and \u2018very clever.\u2019\n\nUnusual: For reasons best known to herself she had made a chocolate cake that tasted of pears, maple cream cheese, and ginger\n\nNot convinced: \u2018It\u2019s a bit wobbly and clumsy,\u2019 tutted Prue as she observed her creation\n\nHis fig rolls resembled sausage rolls (not much of a stretch admittedly) while his \u2018cheese\u2019 was actually cake with orange fondant.\n\n\u2018Bravo!\u2019 cheered Prue Leith.\n\nThe theme proved salt in the wound for Alice, whose parents were in danger of missing the final\u2019s special picnic when their flight was cancelled.\n\nEvery time Sandi Toksvig checked for an update on their progress, Alice started sobbing.\n\n\u2019It\u2019s my worst nightmare really. The biggest day of my life and everything! I couldn\u2019t imagine it without them.\u2019\n\nHere we go: As usual, it all came down to Showstopper \u2013 \u2018a deliciously deceptive picnic\u2019 where the Bakers\u2019 creations had to look like something else\n\nInteresting: \u2018They could make a bread roll look like a pork pie,\u2019 Hollywood explained. \u2018Or a cake that looks like a banana'\n\nShe bravely battled on making pork pies, chicken drumsticks, and Scotch eggs out of carrot cake that Paul Hollywood said were delicious but really didn\u2019t look it.\n\nAs for the favourite going into the final, Steph had been in the lead after the first round.\n\nBut you feared the worst at the start of the programme when the three contestants had an X Factor-style VT (to fill up the time).\n\nFor ten weeks we hadn\u2019t known much about the Bakers (even their surnames) so it seemed a bit later now, particularly with the picture Steph\u2019s family painted.\n\n\u2018She was not in a good place this time last year - not knowing what to do with her life,\u2019 her mum said. \u2018If people could see how far she\u2019s come as a person, they wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u2019\n\nGutted: The theme proved salt in the wound for Alice, whose parents were in danger of missing the final\u2019s special picnic when their flight was cancelled\n\nSad: \u2019It\u2019s my worst nightmare really. The biggest day of my life and everything! I couldn\u2019t imagine it without them,' she said\n\nNonetheless they seemed to suggest Steph had a track record of cracking under pressure \u2013 literally in her younger days as a runner.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s got it all and she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s got anything\u2019 her step grandmother concluded, helpfully.\n\nLike a self-fulfilling prophecy, or as if they\u2019d virtually, psychically, got into Steph\u2019s head, while she was mixing her mixture for the first cake, she told Sandi Toksvig her nerves were \u2018jangling.\u2019\n\n\u2018I used to get like this in athletics as well. I was always nervous that I was going to hit the last hurdle.\u2019\n\nNot the best association.\n\nWell ahead: As for the favourite going into the final, Steph had been in the lead after the first round\n\nAwkward: But in the Technical Challenge, she made the fatal mistake of using cold water for her bain marie and started panicking\n\nIn the Technical Challenge, she made the fatal mistake of using cold water for her bain marie and started panicking.\n\n\u2018I just feel a bit stupid!\u2019 she said tearfully (to herself). \u2018Oh dear, pray for me! Do I keep going? What a disaster!\u2019\n\nShe wasn\u2019t wrong.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like eating sauce,\u2019 concluded Prue, sympathetically, while her colleague complained: \u2018the biscuits are too thick.\u2019\n\nPoor Paul.\n\nWaterworks: \u2018I just feel a bit stupid!\u2019 she said tearfully (to herself). \u2018Oh dear, pray for me! Do I keep going? What a disaster!\u2019\n\nBlunt assessment: \u2018It\u2019s like eating sauce,\u2019 concluded Prue, sympathetically\n\nSteph was such a mess, Noel Fielding gave her a pep talk, reminding her: \u2018you\u2019ve won Star Baker four times\u2019 \u2013 which we know now didn\u2019t help.\n\n\u2018Come on! You\u2019ve got this!\u2019 he added, which people only say when you haven\u2019t.\n\nSure enough Steph\u2019s Showstopper wasn\u2019t any better.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s so dry. It\u2019s just SO bad, all of it!\u2019 she muttered again trying not to cry as her cakes got stuck. \u2018I don\u2019t know how I can get through it.\u2019\n\nUsing an electric whisk to whip up her buttercream, when she lost her grip (on the bowl \u2013 and probably generally), she nearly whisked her fingers off.\n\nSupportive: Steph was such a mess, Noel Fielding gave her a pep talk, reminding her: \u2018you\u2019ve won Star Baker four times\u2019 \u2013 which we know now didn\u2019t help\n\n\u2018There\u2019s obviously been a few issues today,\u2019 Hollywood said judging her \u2018illusion picnic\u2019, complaining her macaroons looked \u2018nothing like strawberries\u2019 (because they didn\u2019t \u2018glisten\u2019) and her giant burger bun cake \u2018hasn\u2019t got much flavor to it. It\u2019s a little bit over-baked as well,\u2019 he added for good measure. \u2018Never mind Steph.\u2019\n\nHe had made her Star Baker in nearly half the episodes of this series but didn\u2019t sound particularly bothered.\n\nSteph was so upset he felt compelled to give her a hug.\n\nThat\u2019s when you knew for sure she was doomed.\n\nTriumphant: David got a hug from Paul after winning Tuesday evening's final", "description": "Steph Blackwell had been vying to become the first contestant in the history of the show to be Star Baker four weeks running.", "authors": ["Jim Shelley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20345502-0-image-a-16_1572382229125.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
