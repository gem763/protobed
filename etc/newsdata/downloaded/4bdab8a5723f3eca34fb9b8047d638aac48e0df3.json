Viewers learn about Bo\u2019s multifunctional wraparound skirt, the skunk mobile, texturing playground rubber and the meaning of bokeh (out-of-focus, photo-blurring effects).\n\nAnother five featurettes touch on introducing some of the new characters (with interview from the voice-over cast), the relationship between Buzz and Woody, what the voice recording process is like, and the cast\u2019s and crew\u2019s favorite toys growing up.\n\nFinally, the director introduces 28 minutes of cut scenes presented in a roughly illustrated and animated format that included some very funny concepts such as Woody and Bo Peep interrogating a popup animal toy.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
