While there was some contact between the players, there wasn\u2019t much to suggest that the on-field officials had missed a clear and obvious case of interference and it didn\u2019t take long for the call to be upheld upon review.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLaFleur could be seen berating himself on the sideline and continued his self-criticism after the game.\n\n\u201cI was pretty upset with myself,\u201d LaFleur said, via Michael Silver of NFL Media. \u201cI saw the play live and felt like he pushed off, but it\u2019s got to be clear and obvious for them to overturn it \u2014 and clearly, it wasn\u2019t clear and obvious enough. I felt pretty sick. That was a big play. It could have hurt us. But thankfully, our defense bailed us out.\u201d\n\nThe Bears also helped bail the Packers out. Left tackle Charles Leno was penalized on the next two plays and Gabriel was flagged for a much more obvious offensive pass interference a play after that to give the Bears a first-and-40 from their own 27-yard-line.\n\nThat led to a punt that was followed by a Packers field goal and an interception that made LaFleur\u2019s bad decision a footnote in his head coaching debut.", "description": "The first pass interference challenge in regular season history came in the fourth quarter of Thursday night's game between the Packers and Bears in Chicago.
