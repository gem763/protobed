His two boys, aged 6 and 9, were thrilled in the way only a 6 and 9 year-old who are about to enter the happiest place on Earth can be. They buzzed with the knowledge that Mickey and Minnie and Pirates and a Haunted Mansion were only minutes away.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when it hit me.\n\nAs we stood at the entrance waiting to shell out more than $100 each for our tickets it occurred to me that \u201cDemocratic Socialists\u201d think of America in exactly the same way my friends\u2019 kids think about Disneyland.\n\nThe country\u2019s growing ranks of Marx\u2019s admirers are more than willing to enjoy the wondrous benefits, products, and near-infinite spectrum of services that have been created, paid for, and maintained by a complex system they do not understand and cannot appreciate.\n\nFor example, my friend\u2019s children have no concept of cost. And why would they, they\u2019re kids! From their perspective, they get to see Donald Duck and Goofy and scream their little hearts out as they zip through Space Mountain because Dad puts a card into a little box, punches a few buttons, and when he\u2019s finished a person in the kiosk lets them into the park. The hours of work their Dad performed to earn the money that paid for the tickets is beyond them. The money spent on lunch and snacks and parking and a custom-built lightsaber means nothing to them. Ideas about work and value are as foreign and meaningless to the kids as Euclidean algebra.\n\nIt is likewise impossible for them to conceive of what is required for the park to function. The minute planning, operational expertise, and engineering prowess that goes into providing the same world-class experience to the estimated 44,000 people who visit the park each day is absolutely staggering. From the technical witchcraft involved in programming life-like animatronic characters to traffic flow engineering that moves thousands of cars in and out of the park to the supply chain specialists who ensure the Jungle Cruise tour guides have the right kinds of blanks in their revolvers, the everyday details involved in making the park work are breathtaking and innumerable.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, each of those details has to occur at precisely the right time, in the proper sequence, day-in and day-out, every day.\n\nThe millions and millions of details that make the park work cannot be legislated to completion. Nor can anyone simply decree that these things occur regardless of whether the person is an elected official, Chairman of Disney\u2019s corporate board, or King Canute.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the children don\u2019t appreciate the investment - and risk - involved in producing everything they see around them.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s no way for them to know that Disney invested $1 billion on the park\u2019s newest Star Wars-themed attraction. That\u2019s real money Disney earned and invested to grow its business at a time when attendance at the company\u2019s domestic theme parks was down.\n\nWhich brings us back to where we began.\n\nSubstitute \u201cDemocratic Socialist\u201d in place of my friend\u2019s kids and replace \u201cDisneyland\u201d with \u201cguaranteed government job,\u201d \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d or \u201cAmerican healthcare.\u201d\n\nScary, isn\u2019t it?\n\nTake healthcare, for example. Does anyone who hears Uncle Bernie describe his plan to take our system down to the proverbial studs and then recreate it according to his ideas of fairness and equity get the impression he has anything more than a superficial understanding of the system?\n\nOr is it more believable that the Uncle Bernie and the Democratic Socialists, like my friend\u2019s kids at Disneyland, only see the miraculous advances in healthcare without any apparent appreciation for the dizzyingly complex, difficult, and risk-laden system that makes it all possible?\n\nOr, to paraphrase the old saying, it\u2019s easy for a former Brooklyn bartender to perform an appendectomy in Iowa from her posh congressional desk in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe same could be said for any of the other industries or sectors of the economy Democratic Socialists aspire to control. One need look no further than California\u2019s housing market to see the perverse and counter-productive effects when Democratic politicians attempt to legislate the free market into conformance with their ideological will.\n\nAnd there is arguably only a quantitative difference between a child\u2019s failure to appreciate the cost to their parents for a day at Disneyland and the Democratic Socialists\u2019 trillion-dollar plans for the Green New Deal or wiping out student loan debt. For the kids and the Democratic Socialists, cost has nothing to do with the price of eggs. (Or maybe it does, and that\u2019s why Democratic Party apologists are positing new/ancient economic theories to support their grandiose spending plans.)\n\nA stage full of Democratic presidential hopefuls have repeatedly displayed no apparent concern for the seismic waves their proposed expenditures would have on the broader national, and international, economy.\n\nInstead, they persist in childish view that the bounty we enjoy as Americans is foreordained and that it will somehow continue on its current trajectory forever. They also think this bounty will continue regardless of what they do.\n\nIt won\u2019t.\n\nThe American system is both a fragile, dynamic, and complicated thing, and it is become distressingly clear that the line-up of Democratic Socialists who aspire to lead us have no better understanding of it than my friend\u2019s kids do when they visit Disneyland.\n\nThe main difference of course being that if Democratic Socialists win the next election, nobody will mistake America for the happiest place on Earth.", "description": "Not long ago I went to Disneyland with a friend .09/13/2019 14:10:28PM EST.", "authors": ["Patrick", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/320/1e8a2e89-3e83-4f7c-acfb-b6f642c5199a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
