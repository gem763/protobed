she and her husband planned a trip of a lifetime, driving their camper van around Europe and hiking where they could.\n\nBut just two months before they were due to hit the road, her husband died suddenly.\n\nIn the midst of grief and with retirement looming, Ann didn\u2019t feel confident enough to go travelling on her own, but still felt like she wanted to see more of the world.\n\n\u2018A friend had volunteered with an organisation called Voluntary Services Overseas (VSO), a not-for-profit organisation that sends teachers, medics and aid workers to some of the poorest countries,\u2019 says Ann.\n\n\u2018It seemed like a good way to see the world, while also doing a bit of good.\u2019\n\nTentatively, Ann signed up, and at first she had no idea where she would be stationed.\n\nShe packed up the house she had shared with her husband for many years, putting everything into storage so she could rent it out for two years.\n\nShe would be leaving behind her two grown-up children and two grandchildren, but the family was fully supportive.\n\nJust a few months before Ann was due to begin with VSO, she found out she would be going to Nepal in South Asia.\n\n\u2018I was very excited at the prospect,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s somewhere my husband and I had always planned to go, because we both loved hiking and the mountains.\u2019\n\nBecause Ann had spent 15 years as a head teacher of a primary school, she was asked to take part in a programme that trained local Nepalese teachers, funded by UK Aid.\n\n\u2018I packed up my entire life into a backpack and small suitcase that weighed just 30kg, and flew to Kathmandhu,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018It just goes to show how little of what we own we actually need.\u2019\n\nAnn was stationed in a town not far from the Annapurna mountains.\n\nHer role would cover 12 rural schools, the closest of which was an hour\u2019s walk away, while the longest would take five hours on a bus with a three hour hike on the other side.\n\nChanging lives\n\n\u2018I\u2019d had six weeks of Nepali lessons, so I understood a little bit of the language,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018On my first day I was introduced to some of the local VSO staff, and one young woman asked, with genuine concern, \u201cYou\u2019re very old, are you sure you can do this job?\u201d\n\n'Her own mother was my age and had had such a hard life that she couldn\u2019t imagine her doing it.\u2019\n\nBut, in fact, Ann relished the challenge.\n\nWalking for so many miles each day meant her fitness levels rocketed and she dropped from a size 14 to a size 10.\n\nOne of Ann\u2019s most important tasks was improving conditions for girls at school.\n\n\u2018It was wonderful when I met the girls for the first time,\u2019 she remembers.\n\n(Image: Rowan Griffiths/Daily Mirror)\n\n\u2018They were very interested that I\u2019d had a career \u2013 many of them don\u2019t make it all the way through school, because of pressures to work in the fields to feed their family, or to stay at home and care for relatives.\u2019\n\nOne of the issues that Ann noticed right away was shame among girls about having their periods.\n\nIn some parts of Nepal, a practice called chhaupadi \u2013 in which menstruating women are banned from the home and made to sleep in cattle sheds or \u2018exile huts\u2019\u2013 is still followed, despite having been made illegal in 2017.\n\nMany women and children have died of smoke inhalation, fire or snake bites in these makeshift huts.\n\nAlthough she didn\u2019t see the practice first hand, Ann soon became aware that when girls were on their period, they often stopped coming to school altogether.\n\n\u2018I noticed how bad the girls\u2019 toilets were in many of my schools,\u2019 says Ann.\n\n\u2018Lots of them didn\u2019t have any running water, so if the girls came on their period early they wouldn\u2019t even be able to have a wash.\n\n'Some of them had no toilet doors, so there was no privacy.\n\n'We set about making these better, and we also started a programme teaching girls to make their own washable sanitary pads to use instead of rags.\n\n'Soon, they were showing the younger girls how to make them too.\u2019\n\nTotal devastation\n\nEighteen months into her time in Nepal, the country was rocked by an enormous earthquake, measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale.\n\n\u2018It was the most frightening few minutes of my life,\u2019 remembers Ann.\n\n\u2018The noise was terrific: things were falling off shelves in my flat and I could see metal frames buckling and windows popping out.\n\n'You\u2019re supposed to stay in the building and go to the corner where the walls are strongest, but panic took over.\n\n'I was just terrified that something was going to fall on me, so I ran until I reached the rice terraces behind my building.\u2019\n\nThe rice fields were filled with people desperate to escape the tall buildings.\n\nDespite everyone having been through the same ordeal, Ann was struck with just how many locals came to see if she was OK.\n\n\u2018They were terrified too, but that\u2019s Nepali people for you \u2013 always looking out for others,\u2019 she says.\n\nAnn managed to text her daughter a brief message before the network cut out: \u2018Earthquake, I am OK.\u2019\n\nIn total, 9,000 people were killed and hundreds of thousands were made homeless.\n\nDespite being just 25 miles from the epicentre, the damage to the town was only moderate, but the impact on the mountain schools and villages was devastating.\n\n\u2018One of my students was killed and many, many saw their homes destroyed,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018Because it is difficult and expensive to get concrete to the remote villages, most buildings are held together by mud and wood, which just didn\u2019t hold out.\n\n'VSO offered to repatriate me immediately, but all I could think of was my girls.\n\n'I had survived the earthquake, I could survive the aftermath.\n\n(Image: News Agency/REX Shutterstock)\n\n'I thought, \u201cThere\u2019s lots to do here \u2013 let\u2019s get on with it.\u201d\u2019\n\nUNICEF launched a project to repair and rebuild the schools as quickly as possible, so that the children\u2019s education wouldn\u2019t be irrevocably interrupted.\n\nRight away, Ann began to help organise supplies.\n\n\u2018We reached remote schools where teachers were still trying to teach kids beneath the trees,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018I remember one school where the classrooms had been completely destroyed, and the head teacher just sobbing, saying, \u201cHow can we help the children now?\u201d\n\n'But we organised tractors full of supplies to be taken up the mountains, and within weeks we were able to get things up and running.\u2019\n\nAnn worked every single day for six weeks.\n\n\u2018I should have been exhausted, but because I had a purpose I powered on,\u2019 she says. \u2018It felt good to see the impact our work was having.\u2019\n\nAnn also helped arrange a programme to help the girls overcome the trauma of experiencing an earthquake, working through their fears with art and music.\n\n\u2018Many of the girls had seen their homes and villages destroyed, and it is a lot to cope with,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018I was very blas\u00e9 about the impact it had on me, until much later when I got home and was standing in my daughter\u2019s kitchen.\n\nWhen the washing machine went onto spin mode, I was out of the door in a second.\n\n'I didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d been affected in that way.\u2019\n\nAfter two years in Nepal, Ann returned home and did so knowing the project had been a huge success.\n\nShe is still in touch with many of the local VSO workers, many of whom call her their \u2018biddeshi mum\u2019, which translates as foreigner mum.\n\nOn Mother\u2019s Day, she receives cards from them.\n\nAnn has been back to Nepal for two shorter projects and now gives talks about the power of volunteering in retirement.\n\nShe even spoke at the Tory Party Conference about the positive impact that UK Aid can have, and has been awarded an OBE for services to charity.\n\nThere\u2019s one small problem, though\u2026 \u2018I\u2019m supposed to be collecting my OBE in November, but I\u2019ll be in Nepal then,\u2019 she says with a laugh.\n\n\u2018So I\u2019ve had to postpone it.\u2019\n\nThere aren\u2019t many people who would put off meeting the Queen because they are busy volunteering, but then Ann isn\u2019t an ordinary woman.\n\n\u2018This whole experience has given me a completely different dimension to my retirement \u2013 it\u2019s given me a different purpose and a different way of looking at things,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018I gained as much from the volunteering role as the people I was working with, and I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world.\u2019\n\nFor more information on VSO or to donate, go to CLICK HERE.
