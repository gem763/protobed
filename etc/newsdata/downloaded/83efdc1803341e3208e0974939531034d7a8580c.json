Jim\u00e9nez eventually changed locations to continue her report, according to El Pais. The Spanish newspaper said some marchers claimed her presence was a \u201cprovocation\u201d, while others defended her.\n\nThe march was attended by around 18,000 people, and local police said no other incidents were reported. Jim\u00e9nez described the incident as \u201chumiliating\u201d, according to Telecinco, which said protesters called her a \u201cSpanish whore\u201d and yelled at her to \u201cget out of Catalonia\u201d.\n\nSpanish and Catalan politicians condemned the attack. \u201cDoing this with a female worker with a microphone on the street is disgusting,\u201d Republican Party of Catalonia spokesman Gabriel Rufi\u00e1n wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists urged local authorities to investigate the incident. \u201cAuthorities must quickly and thoroughly investigate the attacks on Telecinco reporter Laila Jim\u00e9nez and bring those responsible to justice,\u201d CPJ\u2019s New York-based program director Carlos Martinez de la Serna said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe harassment of journalists covering protests in Spain is far too common. Authorities must put an end to this trend and ensure that journalists can freely and safely cover demonstrations.\u201d\n\nMore than two million people, or 92 per cent of a 43 per cent turnout, voted for independence in the controversial referendum, which was passed by the Parliament of Catalonia but declared illegal by the Constitutional Court of Spain.\n\nfrank.chung@news.com.au", "description": "A Spanish TV reporter struggled to hold back tears after being attacked live on-air by a group of Catalan independence protesters in Barcelona on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Frank Chung"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/69f4a626b9999714d2c6239b364cee35?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
