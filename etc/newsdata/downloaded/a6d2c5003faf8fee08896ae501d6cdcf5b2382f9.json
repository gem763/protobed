The rulers by which we measure ethics, people\u2019s relationships, emotions, anything that people wish to measure.\n\nVictoria called out cruel commenters on social media (Picture: Han Myung-Gu/WireImage)\n\n\u2018A public platform is a place where you can share things with others. When did it become a place to put on a show? You can post if you want, and if you don\u2019t want to, you don\u2019t have to. There is no empathy, just yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If you want to see a show, then shout. If you want to create rumours, keep at it. I\u2019m not extraordinary. I just want to live my life more grounded in reality than the people leaving comments.\u2019\n\nVictoria continued: \u2018Don\u2019t speculate. If you have time to come up with a story, what do you think about spending that time doing something more meaningful? Please don\u2019t let [commenting and social media] become your life. You can\u2019t find your identity in a world that\u2019s made up of falsehoods. People need to take walks through reality. Please don\u2019t waste your time.\n\nSulli is suspected to have taken her own life (Picture: EPA/YONHAP)\n\n\u2018Please don\u2019t tell others what they need to do with their lives. Even well-intentioned advice has its boundaries. Don\u2019t overstep. What right do you have to tell a stranger to do this, or don\u2019t do that, when your own life is a wreck? Everyone\u2019s life is different and unique. Who has the right to tell someone else how to live?\n\n\u2018Focus on your own life. Live in the present. If you live with a kind heart, that is enough.\u2019\n\nThis comes after Sulli, who was in f(x) alongside Victoria from 2009 until 2015, died aged 25 by suspected suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe singer, real name Choi Jin-ri, had previously struggled with receiving abuse online, even going on hiatus from f(x) in 2014 due to the trolling.\n\nSulli was the MC of the JTBC show Night of Hate Comments, where she read out all the mean comments written about her online.\n\nFollowing her death, lawmakers in Korea have reportedly proposed a bill called Sulli\u2019s Act to tackle cyber-bullying.\n\nNeed support?
