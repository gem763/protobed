Bad conditions for a child in the dark.\n\nHere are photos of Ethan. Thanks to everybody who wants to help. We still are asking people to stay away from the area where he was last seen. We aren't asking for volunteers to search at this time.

It was about 30 degrees outside, Fines said.\n\nHere are photos of the dog that Ethan was with when he was last seen. Dog's name is Remington, answers to 'Remmie.\" pic.twitter.com/L8SNle4A05 \u2014 Sherburne Co Sheriff (@SherbCoSheriff) October 16, 2019\n\nCoordinated crews of people were taken by bus to different areas of the woods and cornfields to look for him, and a rescue helicopter was circling overhead. Fines waited a few hours to deploy his drone until the skies were clear.\n\nAD\n\nSherburne County Sheriff Joel Brott, who was coordinating the search, said everyone was \u201cdefinitely worried.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rugged terrain, heavily wooded, a lot of underbrush,\u201d Brott said. \u201cIt\u2019s dark out, not ideal searching conditions. The little boy is not very big.\u201d\n\nAround 10 p.m., Fines sent up his drone, communicating with Brott and others about where he needed to look and which search pattern to use. Fines had a monitor to watch what the camera was sensing.\n\nAfter a few minutes, he saw something on his screen that was unusual. When volunteers arrived to the spot, they found three otters. A big disappointment, but he kept at it, spotting deer, a bear, raccoons and other animals over several hours.\n\nIt was dark and impossible to see anything in plain sight except what was illuminated by flashlights, he said. Around 1 a.m., he took a thermal photo of a cornfield, and captured a line of hundreds of dedicated volunteers.\n\n\u201cThat was 250 people out in the mud at 1 in the morning,\u201d Fines said. \u201cNobody was losing hope, nobody was going home.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen, at about 1:30, a volunteer on the ground found what looked like a child\u2019s footprint in a cornfield. It was less than a mile from where Fines was. He flew his drone to that area and saw on his monitor a shape that he called \u201cindistinct.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was but I saw movement,\u201d Fines said. \u201cI saw what I thought was the shape of a dog\u2019s head and that was exciting. The dog\u2019s head looked different from a deer head, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of deer heads. It looked really promising.\u201d\n\nA search party of two men and their teenage sons hustled over to the spot Fines was watching on his monitor. Fines remotely illuminated the drone and hovered over what he believed was the dog head. Then he watched his monitor.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI could see the four heat spots approaching. When they got about 50 feet away, I saw the dog get up and start running around,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you could see one of the rescuers run up to the boy and pick him up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe knew it was Ethan. They had found him.\n\n\u201cI just watched it quietly for a few seconds,\u201d Fines said. \u201cI wanted to savor that moment because there\u2019s a lot of moments in life and that was a really good one.\u201d\n\nThen he heard it over the radio: After 10 hours in the cold, Ethan had been found, lying down and shivering in a cornfield with Remington at his side.\n\nIn the pitch black, Fines heard a chorus of hooting and happy screaming from 700 people. There were eruptions of joy from cornfield to cornfield.\n\n\u201cIt was the middle of the night and sound carries,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could hear people from a mile away. I\u2019m not kidding.\u201d\n\nEthan, who was found about a mile and a half from his home, was hurried into a waiting ambulance. Brott climbed into the back to check on Ethan, who was cold but otherwise doing fine, he said. The sheriff said the boy didn\u2019t appear to be terrified or worse for wear after his hours-long misadventure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe was your normal little boy,\u201d Brott said. \u201cI think having his best friend, his dog with him, kept him pretty calm.\u201d\n\nEthan\u2019s mother, Sheri Haus, a high school science teacher, said she was grateful and overwhelmed by the enormous support from her community.\n\n\u201cI hugged people I never thought I\u2019d hug and I cried with people I never thought I\u2019d cry with,\u201d Haus said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock. I\u2019m still in disbelief.\u201d\n\nBrott gave a special shout-out to Fines, and also echoed Haus\u2019s sentiment, saying that \u201cwithout 700-plus volunteers we never would have been in a position to make it happen.\u201d\n\nOn Facebook, Haus posted a big thank you, and linked to video of a boisterous and smiling Ethan.\n\n\u201cThank you for finding me!\u201d he says into the camera. \u201cYou make my heart full!\u201d\n\nThankful for the outpouring of support in the mission to find Ethan. We are overwhelmed by the police, fire departments, rescue, food, water and hundreds of volunteers that gave up up their night for Ethan. We appreciate everything you have done and can\u2019t thank you enough! \ud83d\udc95 Posted by Sheri Swedal Haus on Wednesday, October 16, 2019\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Ethan wandered away with his dog into an area of cornfields and woods with ankle-deep water.
