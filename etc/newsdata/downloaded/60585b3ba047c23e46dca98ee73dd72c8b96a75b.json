(Picture: Getty Images)\n\nWhatsApp is looking to make a few adjustments.\n\nBack in February 2018, over one and a half billion people used the app, making it one of the most popular apps of all time.\n\nAnd we can only imagine that number has grown since then.\n\nSo what are WhatsApp working on to keep improving and growing?\n\nVanishing messages\n\nVanishing text \u2013 or for more of an oomph let\u2019s call them self-destructing messages \u2013 are making their way to the app.\n\nAccording to information found in the Beta software by Twitter account WABetaInfo, it looks like you can send messages that will self-destruct after a certain time has passed, like how Snapchat works.\n\nWhatsApp\u2019a newest features could have been inspired by other successful apps (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nWhatsApp looks set to name the feature \u2018Disappearing Messages,\u2019 which feels very \u2018does-what-it-says-on-the-tin.\u2019\n\nCan you get WhatsApp other devices?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a report from BGR, WhatsApp has plans to become a multi-platform system that will enable users to use the same account across a number of devices \u2013 like how Apple\u2019s iMessage works.\n\nThis will be a step further than the current WhatsApp web feature, which still requires you to have your phone on and connected.\n\nCan you get WhatsApp on the iPad?\n\nIf it starts to work across multiple devices, we might not be far off WhatsApp for an iPad or tablet.\n\nIf you send video clips or files to read over WhatsApp, the larger screen of an iPad could be much more useful.\n\nWhatsApp Dark Mode\n\nTwitter\u2019s done it. Apple and Android have a setting for it. So now WhatsApp might be unveiling a dark mode to save your eyes from glaring white screens or bright colours.\n\nThe dark mode on Twitter switches the colour settings so the white background and pops of turquoise blue become darker blues against a black backdrop.\n\nWhatsApp currently has quite bright green and white colour palettes, so the dark mode might make it easier to check your messages first thing after waking up.\n\nHow to update WhatsApp to the latest version\n\nThese improvements and extra features haven\u2019t officially launched yet, so there\u2019s no need to rush and update your systems.\n\nBut if you want to check you\u2019re using the latest version of the app, the steps are different depending on what phone you\u2019re using.\n\nUpdating WhatsApp on an Android Go to the Play Store, then tap Menu (the three horizontal lines in the top-left corner of your screen).
