Well, not the whole time, but for like an hour before the scene,\u2019 he explained to Esquire magazine recently.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nGoing further to give the people what they want, Robert said he was \u2018basically unconscious the whole time\u2019 while filming moments his character is drunk off kerosene, which seems like an easy day on the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It was crazy,\u2019 Robert went on. \u2018I spent so much time making myself throw up. Pissing my pants. It\u2019s the most revolting thing. I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s really annoying.\u2019\n\nMaybe.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all urinating on himself and throwing up, though, as he added he also spent time spinning around in circles before takes to really get into the mad man mentality, while also putting rocks in his shoes \u2013 which is enough to send anyone around the bend.\n\nRob stars alongside Willem\n\nRobert puts his sanity on the line however his thoughts on getting into character comes after he admitted he was sick of \u2018masturbating\u2019 in films.\n\nWhile recently discussing recurring themes in his movies, the star moaned that he\u2019s constantly being told to pleasure himself on camera. Which \u2013 considering it\u2019s happened in four of Rob\u2019s movies \u2013 is kind of a fair point.\n\n\u2018I keep masturbating. In the last three or four movies, I\u2019ve got a masturbation scene,\u2019 the Twilight star told Variety magazine.\n\n\u2018I did it in High Life. I did it in Damsel. And The Devil All the Time. I only realised when I did it the fourth time.\u2019\n\nBeing an actor \u2013 it\u2019s a hard knock life.\n\nThe Lighthouse is in UK cinemas 31 January, 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
