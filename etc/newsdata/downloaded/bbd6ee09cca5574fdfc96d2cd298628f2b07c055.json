While there was nothing in the Constitution or in House rules that required this, it was an effective argument, because the leaking of private depositions was starting to smell unfair.\n\nBut now that Pelosi has unveiled a Halloween surprise, saying the House will vote on the inquiry on Thursday, Republicans are treating it as a bad trick. They say they will oppose the vote that many of them had been demanding.\n\nTRUMP DRAWS MUTED PRAISE, SHARP CRITICISM IN AL-BAGHDADI DEATH\n\nMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy: \u201cWe will not legitimize the Schiff/Pelosi sham impeachment.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Pelosi was \u201cfinally admitting what the rest of America already knew \u2014 that Democrats were conducting an unauthorized impeachment proceeding, refusing to give the president due process, and their secret, shady, closed-door depositions are completely and irreversibly illegitimate.\u201d\n\nKey word: Irreversibly.\n\nSince the old process was a travesty, they say, it has tainted the new process, which is what they said they wanted.\n\nDoes it sound like demanding a vote was a useful talking point until the moment Pelosi agreed to such a vote? It\u2019s hard to escape that conclusion. The latest round gives a boost to those who say that when it comes to the Ukraine probe, many Republicans are largely arguing process rather than substance.\n\nThe speaker, who is ready to move toward public hearings, wrote to colleagues that she wants to \u201celiminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas or continue obstructing the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nOne reason Pelosi held off is that some moderate Democrats in swing districts didn\u2019t want to cast what would be seen as an early pro-impeachment vote. But perhaps the party is feeling more confident after the recent hearings.\n\nThe latest witness, testifying yesterday, is Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council. He is also a lieutenant colonel who was wounded by an IED in the Iraq war and awarded a Purple Heart.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nAnd he was on the famous July 25 call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIn his opening statement, first leaked to the New York Times, Vindman says: \u201cIt is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks earlier, upon learning that to get a Trump meeting Ukraine would have to \u201cdeliver investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma,\u201d Vindman says he told Trump ambassador Gordon Sondland that his statements \u201cwere inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the National Security Council was going to get involved with or push.\u201d\n\nAfter the Zelensky call, Vindman says, he expressed his concerns to the NSC\u2019s top lawyer because \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe lieutenant colonel, who was born in Ukraine and emigrated to the U.S. at the age of 3, quickly drew flak from the president, who tweeted that he is \u201ctoday\u2019s Never Trumper witness.\u201d\n\nFormer GOP congressman Sean Duffy, now a CNN contributor, said on that network: \u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s concerned about American policy, but his main mission was to make sure that the Ukraine got those weapons. He has an affinity I think for the Ukraine.\u201d That is an accusation of dual loyalty against Vindman, who tried to get the military aid to Ukraine unfrozen.\n\nJohn Yoo, a former Bush Justice Department official, said on Fox last night: \u201cSome people might call that espionage.\u201d He was referring to a passage in the Times piece saying Ukrainian officials sought advice from Vindman on how to deal with Rudy Giuliani, who was leading the effort to dig up dirt on the Bidens. Vindman was reflecting what he thought was the official White House position. And that makes him a spy? (Yoo later said he had been misconstrued and that he meant the Ukrainians might be engaging in espionage.\u201d)\n\nLiz Cheney, the congresswoman who backs an aggressive foreign policy, said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that some are \u201cquestioning the patriotism\u201d of people like Vindman.\n\nOnce Pelosi pulls off her Halloween surprise, with its inevitable party-line vote, perhaps Americans will get to see witnesses such as Vindman and decide for themselves. The Democrats think they have a compelling case, but it hasn\u2019t been exposed to sunlight, let along cross-examination.", "description": "For weeks now, President Trump and Republicans on the Hill have been denouncing the Democratic impeachment process as unfair and even illegal.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/29/694940094001_6098868349001_6098870257001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
