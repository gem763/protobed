Kasparov lost 5-1 in rapid, though the score flattered Caruana, who benefited from a blunder and a time forfeit in two winning positions for his opponent.\n\nChess: Try your skill on the Levitt test.

His 2014 bid to unseat Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the eccentric head of the global chess body Fide, was also easily defeated. Kasparov has since found his niche by combining work as an international speaker on Russian affairs with helping the billionaire Rex Sinquefield, who bankrolls many events in Saint Louis as well as the Grand Tour tournament circuit.\n\nStarting in 2017, Sinquefield persuaded Kasparov to compete in special speed events against current elite grandmasters. The first occasion was a significant success, as Kasparov took on America\u2019s top trio of Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura and Wesley So. He held his own comfortably and could have won the tournament if he had converted his favourable positions.\n\nKasparov lost his 2018 Champions Showdown match with his old rival Veselin Topalov, using random starting positions, 14.5-11.5 despite winning the final two games. So it was a surprise that this year\u2019s match was against the formidable Caruana. A decisive moment came as early as the second rapid game, where Kasparov had a winning position only to make the fatal blunder in this week\u2019s puzzle.\n\nHe did better in blitz, but with rapid counting double Caruana had a winning 14.5-3.5 margin at the start of Thursday\u2019s final eight blitz games. The 2018 world title challenger benefited from another disaster where Kasparov overstepped in a winning position.\n\n\u201cI can fight all opponents, but not age. Time is the most powerful opponent none of us can beat. I\u2019m actually quite happy with what I did today,\u201d said Kasparov after the second day.\n\nChess with variable starting positions is becoming more mainstream and potentially more marketable. Known as \u201cFischer Random\u201d from Bobby Fischer who first popularised it, the name changed to Chess 960 (the number of possible starting positions) 20 years ago when annual tournaments began, The Saint Louis organisers have copyrighted the name as Chess 9LX.\n\nWill Kasparov return again in 2020 after such a heavy defeat? He explained that he prefers 9LX because he does not need to prepare before the tournament, but his blunders and slow play speak otherwise. In 2017 he relied on his trusted Sicilians and King\u2019s Indians from 20 years ago and they still worked against well-prepared opponents.\n\nWhile one legend was suffering in Saint Louis, another is on the brink of a special success in Torquay. GM Keith Arkell is poised for what may be a unique record in a traditional tournament: After seven of the nine rounds of the Paignton Premier at Torquay, he led with 5.5/7, ahead of his nearest rival by 1.5. First prize would be his 25th victory in this, the Devon county annual tournament, in 27 attempts. Arkell wins many games by classic and simple chess, as here from round two this year.\n\n\u2018Creative\u2019 AlphaZero leads way for chess computers and, maybe, science | Sean Ingle Read more\n\nPaignton used to be played at Oldway Mansion, the Versailles-style home of the Singer sewing machine family. In its inaugural year in 1951, Harry Golombek won, defeating the former world champion Max Euwe from a pawn down. A popular feature was a putting green immediately outside the playing hall, so that you could improve your golf while waiting for your opponent\u2019s move.\n\nThe tournament is named the Ron Bruce Premier in memory of a Devon stalwart who once played and lost to two world champions in a single day. That was at Plymouth 1938, where Bruce lost to the world woman champion Vera Menchik in round two in the morning then to Alexander Alekhine in the evening: 1 e4 c6 2 Nc3 d5 3 Nf3 dxe4 4 Nxe4 Bf5 5 Ng3 Bg6 6 h4 h6 7 Ne5 Bh7 8 Qh5 g6 9 Bc4 e6 10 Qe2 Nf6 11 Nxf7!
