Six months ago saw the release of the OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro, and today OnePlus has announced the OnePlus 7T Pro, the high-end sibling to the OnePlus 7T that the company first revealed last month. The new phone costs \u00a3699, and will be available to buy in the UK starting on October 17th, but there\u2019s currently no US release planned for the device.\n\nAlongside the new device, OnePlus has also announced European pricing details for the OnePlus 7T, with prices starting at \u00a3549. The OnePlus 7T will also be available in the UK starting from October 17th. Previously, OnePlus has announced that the phone will cost $599 in the US when it goes on sale there on October 18th.\n\nThe final major announcement of the day is a new McLaren Edition of the OnePlus 7T Pro, which comes in a black and orange color scheme and includes 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It will retail for \u00a3799 when it launches on November 5th.\n\nMuch like the phones released earlier this year, the big feature that distinguishes the newly announced OnePlus 7T Pro from the standard 7T is its display. The 6.67-inch QHD+ OLED display curves around the edges of the device, and because of the phone\u2019s pop-up selfie camera, there\u2019s no need for a display notch to contain its 16-megapixel front-facing camera. When Dieter reviewed the OnePlus 7 Pro, he described the screen as being \u201cso large and so expansive you hardly notice there\u2019s a phone behind it when you look at it,\u201d and that\u2019s still absolutely the case here.\n\nBack when we reviewed the OnePlus 7, we said that it was a phone that was designed to make you want to make the step up to its Pro sibling. But with the 7T devices that equation has changed, and the OnePlus 7T now has many of the features that were previously exclusive to the Pro. The 7T now has a 90 Hz display, and it\u2019s also got a triple-camera setup as standard. The gap between the Pro and standard devices is significantly smaller this time around.\n\nIn fact, beyond the obvious design differences, you have to dig into the 7T Pro\u2019s spec sheet a little to work out how it actually differs from the 7T. There\u2019s no 128GB storage option for one thing, so its storage options start at 256GB, and the telephoto lens gives you 3x zoom with optical image stabilization on the 7T Pro compared to 2x with no stabilization on the 7T. It also has a 4,085mAh battery, which is a moderate step up from the 3,800mAh battery in the OnePlus 7T, and just a smidge bigger than the OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s 4,000mAh.\n\nOtherwise, the OnePlus 7T Pro\u2019s specs are very similar to both the OnePlus 7 Pro and the OnePlus 7T. It\u2019s got a triple-camera rear array consisting of a main 48-megapixel f/1.6 camera alongside an 8-megapixel f/2.4 telephoto camera and 16-megapixel f/2.2 ultra wide-angle camera. These specs are identical to the 7 Pro, and the lenses are also arranged in a line, unlike the circular camera bump we saw on the 7T. The new macro mode that was introduced with the 7T is also present on the 7T Pro, allowing users to take photos from as little as 2.5cm away from their subjects.\n\nAgree to Continue: OnePlus 7T Pro Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we\u2019re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. While you\u2019re setting up the OnePlus 7T Pro, you need to agree to the following in order to use your phone: OnePlus\u2019 terms and conditions, End User License Agreement, and privacy policy\n\nGoogle Account terms and conditions Additionally, there are a couple of optional agreements that you need to get past during setup: Participation in the User Experience Program\n\nSystem stability reporting\n\nPush notifications for surveys and product updates\n\nBuilt-in app updates for the phone, contacts, and settings apps That leaves us with four mandatory agreements and four optional agreements for the OnePlus 7T Pro.\n\nThe 7T Pro comes with very similar internals to the 7T, which means it offers a small improvement over the 7 Pro. It\u2019s got a Snapdragon 855 Plus processor with 8GB of RAM, and it supports the new Warp Charge 30T standard that\u2019s up to 23 percent faster than what we saw on the 7 Pro. Where the phone takes a small step back from the 7 Pro is that there\u2019s no 5G version of the device this time around, so you\u2019ll have to put up with a slightly older processor if you want to be able to connect to next-gen networks.\n\nI\u2019ve had a chance to try out the OnePlus 7T Pro over the last few days, and it seems every bit as nice to use as the OnePlus 7 Pro was six months ago. The optical in-display fingerprint sensor is still among the fastest around, battery life is exceptional, and the 90Hz display is just as smooth and vibrant as it was on the 7 Pro.\n\nTechnically, OnePlus says its Snapdragon 855 Plus processor should make its graphics rendering 15 percent faster than the OnePlus 7 Pro, but in real-world usage it was very hard to tell. When I played a couple rounds of Call of Duty: Mobile, I didn\u2019t detect a hint of slowdown, and outside of gaming performance, the phone otherwise felt quick and snappy to use. Apps opened quickly and the camera was responsive. Its performance was hard to fault.\n\nBattery life is another area where the spec sheet suggests there should be an improvement, but the actual benefit of an extra 85mAh of battery capacity compared to the 7 Pro is really difficult to quantify. All I know is that I didn\u2019t come close to draining the phone\u2019s battery during each day I used it, when I\u2019d regularly charge the phone in the evening with 50 percent of its battery life remaining.\n\nGrid View Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nThe telephoto lens on the phone offers up to 3x optical zoom.

Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nI haven\u2019t had a chance to really dig into the camera features on this phone. To my eye, the photographs they produce look very similar to what we saw on the 7 Pro, meaning they look great, if not necessarily best in class. Detail levels are generally good, colors are vibrant, and the camera app switches seamlessly between its telephoto, regular, and wide-angle modes.\n\nThe only problem with the phone is that its \u201cbudget\u201d sibling, the OnePlus 7T, is such a massive improvement over the OnePlus 7 that it hasn\u2019t left much room for the Pro model to really flex its muscles. From where I\u2019m standing, it looks like you have to really want this phone\u2019s notch-less curved display to spend the extra \u00a3150 for the OnePlus 7T Pro, because so much else about the phone is so similar to the cheaper model.\n\nThe OnePlus 7T Pro takes much of what we already liked about the OnePlus 7 Pro and adds a fresh coat of paint to bring it up to speed with the OnePlus 7T. The only question is whether the 7T\u2019s more thorough reworking makes it the better option at its cheaper price point.\n\nPhotography by Jon Porter / The Verge", "description": "OnePlus has announced the OnePlus 7T Pro, the high-end sibling to the OnePlus 7T.
