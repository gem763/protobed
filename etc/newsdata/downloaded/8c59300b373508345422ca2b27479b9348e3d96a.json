Without that nothing can change. It is the constitution that has created the sectarian crisis we've lived in for years,\" the lawyer said, also requesting anonymity.\n\nMany Iraqis blame the current constitution, drafted and approved in 2005, two years after a US-led invasion, for the sectarian nature of Iraq's political system.\n\nMany Iraqis blame the current constitution, drafted and approved two years after the 2003 US-led invasion, for the sectarian nature of Iraq's political system [Bakr al-Ubaidi/ Al Jazeera]\n\nReform and change\n\nIraqi soldiers fired tear gas and stun grenades on Friday as protesters tried to cross a bridge leading to Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, home to the US embassy and Iraqi government offices.\n\nAt least two demonstrators were killed, the Iraqi Human Rights Commission said. Commission member Ali Bayati said \"preliminary information\" indicated those killed had been \"hit in the head or face by tear gas canisters\".\n\nThe commission said 224 people were also taken to hospitals, many with shortness of breath from the tear gas.\n\nAl Jazeera's Natasha Ghoneim, reporting from Baghdad, said demonstrators penetrated the Green Zone on Thursday night after toppling barricades around the heavily fortified area. She said gunfire, water cannon, and tear gas were used to push protesters back to Tahrir Square in central Baghdad.\n\n\"People are very upset about the ongoing lack of economic opportunities, basic services - such as water and electricity - and what they perceive to be a dysfunctional government that is looting the country of its money. Adding to their anger is the fact that in the first round of protests earlier this month, 149 protesters were killed,\" Ghoneim said.\n\nDemonstrations also took place in other parts of the country on Friday, including in the southern city of Nasiriyah, where at least 3,000 protesters stormed the provincial government building and set it ablaze, police sources told the Reuters news agency.\n\nAl Jazeera's Ghoneim said rallies were being held elsewhere in Southern Iraq too, including in the cities of Basra and Samawa.\n\n\"There are people throughout Iraq who have now finished Friday prayers and headed to areas in their cities to protests,\" she said.\n\nIraq's top Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, meanwhile called on protesters and security forces to keep anti-government demonstrations peaceful.\n\n\"Real reform and change in the country has to be through peaceful methods,\" a representative of the cleric said during a Friday sermon in the holy city of Kerbala.\n\nAl-Sistani, who rarely weighs in on politics except in times of crisis, said security forces must not allow attacks on public and private property.\n\nIraqi protesters defy tear gas and live ammunition fired by security forces [Bakr al-Ubaidi/ Al Jazeera]\n\nDeadly crackdown\n\nA government-appointed inquiry into the protests determined in a report published on Tuesday that security forces had used excessive force and live fire to quell the demonstrations, killing 149 people and wounding more than 3,000. Eight members of the security forces were also killed.\n\nThe report, which said more than 70 percent of the deaths were caused by gunshots to head or chest, held senior commanders responsible, but stopped short of blaming Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi and other top officials, saying there had been no orders to shoot.\n\nThe violence - Iraq's worst since the fight against ISIL in 2017 - has posed the biggest challenge to Abdul Mahdi since he took office a year ago.\n\nRenad Mansour, research fellow in the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera that Friday's demonstrations were part of a years-long process of disillusionment among young Iraqis.\n\n\"Iraqis are rejecting the post-2003 system and they have been trying to voice, year after year, their grievances and sense of disillusionment with it,\" Mansour said.\n\n\"This has come in the form of low voter turn-out in the last election, protests across the south [of Iraq] last year ... and even going back to the mass [anti-government] protests in 2015,\" he added.\n\nThe main difference now, Mansour said, was the spike in violence that has escalated since early October.\n\nAt least one demonstrator was killed and more than 200 wounded, according to the Iraqi Human Rights Commission [Bakr al-Ubaidi/ Al Jazeera]\n\nGovernment address\n\nIn an attempt to appease Iraqis in the face of the planned demonstrations, Abdul Mahdi said in a televised speech on Thursday night that people would be free to exercise their right to demonstrate, but warned violence would not be tolerated.\n\nAbdul Mahdi stressed a government collapse would drag Iraq into further turmoil.\n\n\"The resignation of the government today without a constitutional alternative will lead the country into chaos,\" he said.\n\nHe reiterated reforms announced in the aftermath of the protests - including a cabinet reshuffle, job opportunities for unemployed youth, and the establishment of a new court to try corrupt officials.\n\nThe premier also announced that government salaries, including for top officials, would be gradually halved, with funds redirected to a social security fund for the country's poorest citizens.\n\nAdditional reporting by Arwa Ibrahim in Doha: @arwaib and Bakr al-Ubaidi in Baghdad", "description": "Security forces deployed in large numbers in the capital as anti-government demonstration targets the Green Zone.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/25/c27eefac47f84d81b82c28664aa856b4_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
