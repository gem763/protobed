This allows us to build a more complete picture of health in this population.\n\n\u201cOur data show that while former footballers had higher dementia rates, they had lower rates of death due to other major diseases.\n\n\u201cAs such, whilst every effort must be made to identify the factors contributing to the increased risk of neurodegenerative disease to allow this risk to be reduced, there are also wider potential health benefits of playing football to be considered.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, UEFA requested for a change in the game\u2019s laws to reduce the pressure on the medical staff and give doctors more time to assess head injuries off the pitch, so that no concussed player returns to the field of play.\n\n\u201cThe whole game must recognise that this is only the start of our understanding and there are many questions that still need to be answered,\u201d said FA chairman Greg Clarke said.\n\n\u201cIt is important that the global football family now unites to find the answers and provide a greater understanding of this complex issue. The FA is committed to doing all it can to make that happen.\u201d\n\nOutgoing PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor has been strongly criticised for his lack of action on the subject, in particular by the family of former West Bromwich Albion striker Jeff Astle, whose 2002 death from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) was linked to repeatedly heading heavy leather footballs.\n\nTaylor said it was now \u201cincumbent on football globally to come together to address this issue in a comprehensive and united manner\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cResearch must continue to answer more specific questions about what needs to be done to identify and reduce risk factors.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 A new study carried out by Glasgow University has found former footballers are approximately three-and-a- half times more likely to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/8cbbb2_celtic-1967-european-cup-winning-captain-billy-mcneill-died-in-suffering-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
