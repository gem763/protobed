A 4-2 home win.\n\nTeam news\n\nLiverpool will be without Joel Matip and Xherdan Shaqiri, with Matip\u2019s injury not believed to be serious. The game also comes too soon for Alisson, though the Brazilian goalkeeper is nearing a return.\n\nErling Haaland is \u201chealthy and ready for tomorrow,\u201d according to coach Jesse Marsch, but the Austrians will be without Antoine Bernede, who broke his shin in cup action last week.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nLiverpool: Adrian; Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, van Dijk, Robertson; Fabinho, Milner, Henderson; Salah, Firmino, Mane\n\nRB Salzburg: Stankovic; Kristensen, Ramalho, Wober, Ulmer; Szoboszlai, Junuzovic, Mwepu, Minamino; Hwang, Haaland\n\nWhen is it?\n\nKick-off is at 8pm.\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nThe match will be broadcast live on BT Sport 3 and BT Sport Ultimate, and can be streamed online via the BT app.", "description": "Having begun their\u00a0Champions League\u00a0season with defeat in Naples,\u00a0Liverpool\u00a0are looking to get back on track as they look to defend their crown.\u00a0 Salzburg\u00a0are their opponents, with the Austrians travelling to Anfield on the back of an excellent Champions League opener, Belgian side Genk dismissed emphatically 6-2.", "authors": ["Harry Latham-Coyle"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/01/20/Jurgen-Klopp.jpg"}
