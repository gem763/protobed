I want to propose that the EFF must contest. Everybody is fielding their own candidates, why can\u2019t we field our own candidates?\u201d he asked.\n\nMalema added that former Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba was well-liked by the EFF because he had cooperated with the party on certain issues, including the insourcing of workers.\n\nEFF second-in-command Floyd Shivambu referred to him as \u201cour mayor\u201d following his announcement that he would be stepping down on November 27.\n\nMalema said the continuation of the insourcing started under Mashaba\u2019s term was still on the EFF\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cWe want to insource all workers. We don\u2019t want people to win tenders,\u201d he said.\n\nHe made reference to a report by investigative journalists Amabhungane that said that outsourcing led to an irregular fleet contract tender worth R1.2 million.\n\n\u201cCurrently there is an issue of Afrirent because of outsourcing. To avoid speculations of bribes, let us build state capacity to insource,\u201d Malema said.\n\n\n\nWhen speaking about the conference, Malema reiterated that every position in the EFF would be contested. This will be done through delegates who were selected in branches.\n\n\u201cAll members of the EFF are available to take up the leadership positions. We are available but we may not be available for all positions [due to issues of] capacity,\u201d Malema said.\n\nMalema warned EFF members who were not delegates to not to attend the conference because that would be \u201cundermining processes followed in electing delegates\u201d.\n\nThe party\u2019s national chairperson, Dali Mpofu, took the opportunity to dispute weekend reports that there was factional fighting within the EFF and that he would be contesting elections.\n\nCity Press reported on a video that showed Mpumalanga chairperson Collen Sedibe telling branch members that the red berets\u2019 upcoming elective conference at Nasrec was just a formality, and that the position of the national chairperson would be given to MP Veronica Mente, who would replace Mpofu.\n\nRead: Malema, Shivambu to stay but rest of EFF leadership will bite the dust\n\n\u201cWe have no factions. There will never be factions in this party,\u201d Mpofu said.\n\n\n\nThis follows reports that there are those within the EFF who are opposed to leader Julius Malema.\n\nMeanwhile the ANC has also positioned itself to take advantage of the DA\u2019s meltdown following the resignation of Mashaba.\n\nANC Johannesburg spokesperson Jolidee Matongo told City Press last week that it was working hard to woo the DA\u2019s coalition partners away from its cooperation agreement and had managed to entice the African Independent Congress and Al Jama-ah.\n\nRead: ANC\u2019s big effort to reclaim Joburg from DA\n\nIFP national spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa also confirmed to City Press its wish to reconcile with the ANC.\n\n\n\nThe DA has several people in mind to succeed Mashaba, including DA member of the Gauteng provincial legislature Makashule Gana and Johannesburg member of the mayoral committee Funzi Ngobeni.\n\nInternal DA nominations for the position close on Thursday.", "description": "Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema says that his party is considering contesting for the mayoral position in Johannesburg and says that EFF leadership must see themselves in municipal leaderships.", "authors": ["Staff Reporter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9523/143dc5f3bc3d4040801ab0c703b4732e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
