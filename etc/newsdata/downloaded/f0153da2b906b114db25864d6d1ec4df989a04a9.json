Credit Suisse was reportedly worried he'd poach other employees, which led it to hire the security business Investigo to observe his actions, the new report found. The firm was asked to not break any laws or get too close to the banker.\n\nBy Investigo's version of last week's events, one of its employees was conducting surveillance on Khan from his car when the banker approached him and shouted at the investigator. Khan tried to photograph the employee, who blocked the attempt. The investigator acted \"defensively\" against Khan, according to the firm's report.\n\nRead more: 'It's going to 30,000': A CIO who oversees $4.9 billion explains why the Dow is headed for fresh record highs \u2014 and shares his top 4 stock picks for the upswing\n\nKhan noticed he was being tailed while driving with his wife last week, and photographed the following vehicle. The pursuit led to a physical confrontation in Zurich when the investigator attempted to take Khan's phone and the photos he took, people familiar with the events told Bloomberg.\n\nKhan served as CEO of the bank's International Wealth Management division, and has been on leave from Credit Suisse before starting his new role as UBS's co-head of wealth management on October 1.\n\nThree men were arrested after the pursuit, and an investigation into the events is ongoing. Credit Suisse announced Monday it started an investigation into the events.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nVW CEO and chairman charged with market manipulation by German court in relation to 2015 emissions scandal\n\nBeyond Meat gets nailed with its lowest price target yet from firm worried about competition, stock valuation\n\nWalmart is making a big push into healthcare.
