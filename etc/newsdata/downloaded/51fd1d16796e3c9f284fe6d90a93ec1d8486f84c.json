Those same FBI stats show over five times as many people were killed with knives and cutting instruments than were killed with rifles of any kind.\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation calculates there are 16 million-plus privately owned AR-15s in the U.S.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
