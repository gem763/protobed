Since 2011, these events have joined oral storytelling and journalism to reflect and serve communities, as well as to develop connection and empathy in them. Journalists from USA TODAY NETWORK newsrooms manage and host these nights in front of audiences of 75 to 1,200. The series has 100+ nights planned in 2019 alone, at venues ranging from the Ace Hotel and Swim Club in Palm Springs, to Hoyt Sherman Place in Des Moines and the Kentucky Derby Museum in Louisville. In less than 10 minutes each, over 6,000 Americans have shared true, coached and curated stories that celebrate universal values while reflecting on themes chosen by the newsroom\u2019s staff to be broadly appealing, including food and family, love and dating, and growing up. The Storytellers Project celebrates the idea that when we share our stories, we become emotionally and financially invested in one another and in our community.\n\nAbout USA TODAY Network\n\nThe USA TODAY Network is the largest local to national media network in the country.
