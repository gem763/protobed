But over the last few weeks the murder of UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana has given rise to anger and retaliation against gender-based violence in South Africa with #EnoughisEnough.\n\nBut among the cries for action against femicide, one voice was far too faint \u2013 the one of South African men.\n\nThe #RealMenDont campaign is about the coming together of South African men, asking them to raise their voices to protect the women and children of our country. The black and white images represent a \u2018no grey area\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s either black or white, you protect us or you don\u2019t and there is no in-between,\u201d says Nuriyah Gallow, the initiator of #RealMenDont.\n\nGallow, an ad-operations manager at 24.com and a mother of three says the events leading up to the national outcry against gender-based violence and the absence of men standing up against them urged her to start the initiative. She explains that real men don\u2019t kill, rape or abuse and it puts the responsibility on them - not women.\n\nIn their official statement to condemn violence against women, the South African government made this all too familiar mistake of putting gender-based violence in the hands of women. The original tweet has since been removed but an edited version reads as follows.\n\nIn response to the above statement, 27-year-old Ben Liebenberg says he realises that men need to take responsibility and be more accountable for their statements and actions. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be telling our daughters to be careful, we should be raising our sons to be accountable, understand consent, understand boundaries and respect people - especially women,\u201d he says. \u201cWe say \u2018rape needs to stop\u2019 forgetting that someone actually has to do something - that someone being men.\u201d\n\nBut why have men been so passive against this cause? Bongani Mtlhavani argues that men are traditionalists in their approach to issues around women abuse. \u201cIn the villages where I come from, for example, women are seen as submissive to the men they are married to, that filters down to our townships and cities alike.\u201d\n\nNot shying away that this is a problem, Mtlhavani believes that mindsets need to change, and campaigns like #RealMenDont are needed to educate people about this scourge so that over time perceptions and attitudes around women abuse will change.\n\n\u201cInstead of condemning feminism, take a second to learn about it and understand it,\u201d Liebenberg says. \u201cWhen women talk about their experience, listen with intent to understand and learn. Beyond that, simply respect and protect women instead of raping and abusing them.\u201d\n\n#RealMenDont\n\nFrom calling out and addressing misogynistic behaviour to reporting harassment and sexism in the workplace, there are plenty of simple ways that men can actively stand up against gender-based violence.\n\nReal men aren\u2019t passive bystanders to a societal problem that they are responsible for.
