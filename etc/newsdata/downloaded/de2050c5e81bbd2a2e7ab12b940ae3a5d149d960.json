This country has suffered for the past two decades,\u201d Foreign Minister Sibusiso Moyo said in an interview.\n\n\u201cThis is the time when it must be supported in its reforms.\u201d\n\nMnangagwa\u2019s government has taken steps to relaunch the Zimbabwean dollar, cut the budget deficit, remove subsidies on fuel and power and repeal laws curbing public and media freedoms.\n\nBut the currency reforms and austerity measures have compounded ordinary people\u2019s hardships in an economy where unemployment is estimated to be as high as 80%. The opposition says it is being denied the right to protest peacefully.\n\nOn Friday, Zimbabwe\u2019s central bank raised its overnight borrowing rate to 70% from 50% after a surge in inflation and a steep fall in the domestic currency.\n\nMoyo, a former army general and Mnangagwa loyalist, said the government would strengthen social safety nets to cushion the impact of austerity measures and seek to recover public funds \u201cwhere there was clear-cut evidence of pilfering\u201d.\n\nHe said the authorities would not use excessive force to control protests and that there was no blanket ban on demonstrations staged by the main opposition group MDC.\n\n\u201cThis country is undertaking all these reforms, with all the painful processes which are taking place, without any form of support from outside. No lines of credit, no balance of payments support, nothing,\u201d Moyo said.\n\n\u201cWe are a sincere government in delivering the necessary reforms and freedoms.\u201d", "description": "Zimbabwe is serious about pursuing political and economic reforms and deserves international support, its foreign minister told Reuters on Friday.", "authors": ["Alexander Winning", "Macdonald Dzirutwe", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429482759&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1NF-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
