Apparently not U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris of California.\n\nAccording to reports, Feinstein, the senior senator from the Golden State, will throw a fundraiser next month for Democratic 2020 presidential frontrunner Joe Biden -- and not for Harris, another White House contender whose poll numbers suggest she could probably use some high-profile help.\n\nFeinstein and husband Richard Blum will co-host the Biden event Oct. 3 in San Francisco, according to a copy of the invitation obtained by CNBC. Feinstein first gave her backing to Biden in January, months before the former vice president made his campaign official in April.\n\nFEINSTEIN BACKING BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT, SNUBBING FELLOW CALIFORNIAN KAMALA HARRIS: REPORT\n\n\u201cMy candidate would be Joe Biden,\u201d Feinstein told CNBC back then. \u201cI watched him as vice president. I\u2019ve seen him operate. I\u2019ve seen him perform and I think he brings a level of experience and seniority, which I think is really important.\u201d\n\nThe early evening reception will be the first that Feinstein hosts for Biden in the 2020 election, CNBC reported. Her husband has already participated in several fundraising events for Biden, who campaigned for Feinstein in 2018, when she was re-elected by a landslide.\n\nFeinstein has repeatedly faced questions about why she prefers Biden -- who was her Senate colleague for nearly two decades -- over Harris, her home state\u2019s junior senator.\n\nHarris and Biden famously butted heads during Democratic presidential debate earlier this year when Harris challenged Biden\u2019s stance decades ago on the issue of desegregation school busing when he was a U.S. senator from Delaware.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s brand-new here,\u201d Feinstein told the Los Angeles Times about Harris in January when asked if she would support a Harris run for the White House. \u201cIt takes a little bit of time to get to know somebody.\u201d\n\nShe also told the Washington Examiner in May when Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee he made her the \u201cfirst woman\u201d to serve on the panel.\n\n\u201cI love Kamala, I appreciate her,\u201d Feinstein said, \u201cbut that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. I feel very loyal to him.\"\n\nTicket prices begin at $1,000 and cap out at $2,800 per person for the October event. Several other hosts will join Feinstein and Blum on the stage, including Denise Bauer, a former ambassador to Belgium, the emailed invitation said. Feinstein and Blum are not listed as hosts for a fundraising lunch to be held in nearby Palo Alto, Calif., earlier that day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHarris, who previously served as California's attorney general -- and was district attorney of San Francisco, where Feinstein was once the mayor -- was elected to the Senate in 2016. In 2004, Feinstein said she would not have endorsed Harris for San Francisco district attorney if she had known Harris wouldn\u2019t seek the death penalty for a gang member who killed a police officer, the Washington Examiner reported.\n\nFox News\u2019 Brie Stimson contributed to this report.", "description": "Kamala Harris\u2019 California colleague in the Senate, Dianne Feinstein, will host a fundraising event for a different Democrat vying for the White House in 2020\u2014former vice president Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/9e2c2d56-United-States-Iraq-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
