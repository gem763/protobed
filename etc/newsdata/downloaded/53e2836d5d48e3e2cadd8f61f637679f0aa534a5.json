REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir\n\nHis coalition government, which includes the Iran-backed Hezbollah group, reaffirmed a state policy of staying out of conflicts in Arab states. Hariri\u2019s Saudi allies accuse Hezbollah of waging war across the Middle East as agents of Iran.\n\nHariri\u2019s shock resignation had thrust Lebanon to the forefront of the regional quarrel between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which has been played out on battlefields in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.\n\nLebanese officials said Saudi Arabia had coerced Hariri, a long-time Saudi ally, into resigning and put him under effective house arrest until an intervention by France led to his return to Lebanon. Saudi Arabia and Hariri have denied this.\n\nPresident Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, refused to accept his resignation while he remained abroad.\n\nSaudi concern over the influence wielded by Shi\u2019ite Muslim Iran and Hezbollah in other Arab states had been widely seen as the root cause of the crisis, which raised fears for Lebanon\u2019s economic and political stability.\n\nThe Lebanese policy of \u201cdissociation\u201d was declared in 2012 to keep the deeply divided state out of regional conflicts such as the civil war in neighbouring Syria. Despite the policy, Hezbollah is heavily involved there, sending thousands of fighters to help President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIn its first meeting since Hariri\u2019s resignation, the cabinet on Tuesday reaffirmed its commitment to the policy.\n\n\u201cAll (the government\u2019s) political components decide to dissociate themselves from all conflicts, disputes, wars or the internal affairs of brother Arab countries, in order to preserve Lebanon\u2019s economic and political relations,\u201d Hariri said.\n\nPARIS MEETING\n\nLebanon, where Sunni Muslim, Shi\u2019ite, Christian and Druze groups fought a civil war from 1975-1990, has a governing system designed to share power among sectarian groups.\n\nHariri, a wealthy Sunni businessman with long ties to the kingdom, had denounced Iran during his resignation speech and said he was outside Lebanon because he feared for his family\u2019s safety. His father, an ex-prime minister, was assassinated in 2005.\n\nIn a speech during the cabinet session, Hariri warned that the tensions in the region could easily drag Lebanon down a dangerous route, and the issues which had led to the crisis could not be ignored.\n\n\u201cDevelopments in the region suggest a new wave of conflict ... Perhaps the conflict is nearing the end, and Lebanon cannot be plunged into chaos on the finish line.\n\n\u201cIf we are rejecting interference by any state in Lebanese affairs, it cannot be that we accept that any Lebanese side interferes in the affairs of Arab states,\u201d Hariri said, an apparent reference to Hezbollah.\n\n\u201cWe have to address this issue, and take a decision announcing our disassociation, in words and deeds,\u201d he said.\n\nHariri\u2019s resignation was accompanied by a sharp escalation in Saudi statements targeting the Lebanese state, with Riyadh at one point accusing the Beirut government of declaring war against it. Western governments, including the United States, stressed their support for Hariri and Lebanon.\n\nLebanon's Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri speaks after a cabinet meeting in Baabda near Beirut, Lebanon December 5, 2017.

Security Council - Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.\n\nThe meeting, to be opened by French President Emmanuel Macron, aims in part to put pressure on Saudi Arabia and Iran to desist from interference in Lebanon, diplomats said.\n\n(This version of the story re-inserts the word \u201cnot\u201d in paragraph 13)", "description": "Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri rescinded his resignation on Tuesday, drawing a line under a month-long crisis triggered when he announced from Riyadh that he was stepping down and remained outside Lebanon for weeks.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171205&t=2&i=1212466981&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEDB411Y", "published_at": "2017-12-06"}
