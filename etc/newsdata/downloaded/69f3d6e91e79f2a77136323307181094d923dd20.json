People tend to forget about their personal troubles, and we have a large scope of that in South Africa.\n\n\"We do hope South Africans take pride in our performances and create hope.\n\n\"There are lots of challenging times in people\u2019s lives, but if we can make that little bit of difference by putting great performances together, and being a beacon of hope, then that is something we will try and do.\"\n\nLouw, who made his Test debut all the way back in 2010, has 74 Test caps to his name.\n\nHe is expected to start on the bench in this Sunday's semi-final against Wales in Yokohama.\n\nKick-off is at 11:00 (SA time).", "description": "Francois Louw may be based in England these days, but he knows all too well that a successful Springbok side goes a long way towards uniting South Africa.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9504/4f87eac0f82b40ea906ff39ffa8b7b3b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
