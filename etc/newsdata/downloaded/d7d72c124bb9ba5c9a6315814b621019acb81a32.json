ISIS is an enduring threat to America, its interests and its allies.\n\nThis weekend\u2019s news that Islamic State emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had killed himself in Syria\u2019s Idlib Province while being pursued by U.S. special forces operators is unquestionably a major milestone in the fight against the world\u2019s most notorious terrorist group. It also represents an unalloyed political victory for the Trump administration, which has come under fire of late for its decision to draw down the American presence in Syria.\n\nYet, however momentous, Baghdadi\u2019s death remains part of a larger struggle. For although ISIS is significantly diminished, it still possesses formidable strategic capabilities and resources that make it an enduring threat to the United States, as well as to America\u2019s interests and its regional allies.\n\nThe numbers tell the story.\n\nGlobal reach and business model\n\nAt its most powerful, ISIS was estimated to boast a force of some 40,000 foreign fighters drawn from a multitude of nations (among them Russia, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia). Most of this cohort remains active today, despite the collapse of the ISIS caliphate. As of early this year, the U.S. government gauged that the group still had between 20,000 and 30,000 active fighters at its disposal. These forces, in turn, will be bolstered in the years ahead by a new generation of radicals that is now being incubated in enclaves like Syria\u2019s notorious al-Hawl refugee camp.\n\nCredit where due: ISIS leader Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s demise is a triumph for civilization over barbarity\n\nISIS also retains a truly global reach. In fact, over the past year, as its Middle Eastern caliphate has declined, the terror group has succeeded in repositioning itself to other global theaters \u2014 with ominous results. ISIS cells and affiliates are active today throughout Africa and Southeast Asia, where they pose a growing threat to the stability of countries like Nigeria, Indonesia and the Philippines. Indeed, the group may even be poised for a comeback in the Middle East.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen.

At the height of its power, the Islamic State ranked as the best-funded threat group in history, thanks to a sophisticated business model that revolved around multiple revenue streams ranging from oil sales to looting to the taxation of territories under its control. Not much has changed in this regard either. Despite the collapse of its territorial control, experts estimate that ISIS still has access to hundreds of millions of dollars, and continues to generate a steady stream of revenue through informal networks and illicit activities. These funds, in turn, have enabled it to continue funding global operations on an ongoing basis.\n\nOutreach to Muslim hearts and minds\n\nMost of all, the Islamic State\u2019s corrosive ideological message remains as enduring, and as appealing, as ever. Counterterrorism experts and officials caution that there has been no discernible change to patterns of recruitment and radicalization in the broader Muslim world over the past year. They also note that the organization\u2019s outreach \u2014 carried out through a sophisticated apparatus that adroitly exploits social media, online propaganda and new technology \u2014 means that it remains a formidable force in the most important arena of all: the struggle for \u201chearts and minds\u201d taking place in the Muslim World.\n\nHeadache or boon? Donald Trump made a shameful withdrawal from Syria. But is it really a win for Russia?\n\nEven before al-Baghdadi\u2019s demise, the United States was giving every indication that, having successfully destroyed the physical ISIS caliphate, it was eager to turn the page on the \u201cwar on terror.\u201d In the wake of the ISIS emir\u2019s death, the impulse for the Trump administration to consider its counterterrorism mission accomplished is sure to be stronger than ever.\n\nThat, however, would be a dangerous misreading of the resilience of the group that al-Baghdadi once commanded \u2014 and whose ideological message continues to both mobilize and inspire.\n\nIlan Berman is senior vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council.
