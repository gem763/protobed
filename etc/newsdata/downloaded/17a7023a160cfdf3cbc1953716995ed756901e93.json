Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint recounted what led up to that phone call, during which President Trump repeatedly pressured the Ukrainian leader to work with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\"Multiple US officials told me that the Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between the President and President Zelenskyy would depend on whether Zelenskyy showed willingness to \u2018play ball\u2019 on issues that had been publicly aired by Mr. Lutsensko and Mr. Giuliani,\" the whistleblower claimed.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than one day after the White House released a transcript from that call, the whistleblower\u2019s complaint shed\u2019s additional light on how the conversation was perceived by administration officials.\n\n\"I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\" the whistleblower claimed.\n\nNot only did the whistleblower take issue with the nature of the July 25 call, but reported hearing from White House officials \"that they were \u2018directed\u2019 by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored for coordination, finalization, and distribution to Cabinet-level officials.\"\n\n\"Instead,\" the whistleblower claims, \"the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature. One White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\"\n\nThe whistleblower characterized White House lawyers\u2019 actions as part of an effort to \"\u2019lock down\u2019 all records of the phone call.\u201d\n\nAccording to their complaint, the whistleblower reported hearing from White House officials that the president\u2019s phone call with Zelenskiy \"was \u2018not the first time\u2019 under this administration that a presidential transcript was placed into this codeword level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2013 rather than national security sensitive \u2013 information.\"\n\nThe whistleblower did not provide other specific examples of other occasions where a presidential transcript was placed into this system.\n\nSeveral of the president\u2019s defenders have argued that the whistleblower may be politically motivated. The intelligence community inspector general, in a letter to the office of the director of national intelligence, wrote that he did identify some indication of \"arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,\" but he added that \"such evidence did not change my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern 'appears credible,' particularly given the other information the [intelligence community inspector general] obtained during its preliminary review.\"\n\nNews of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint has set into motion a series of events that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing a formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump.\n\nLeah Millis/Reuters\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint was released Thursday morning just moments before Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was scheduled to testify before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nRead the complaint here:\n\nMaguire by ABC News Politics on Scribd", "description": "The House Intelligence Committee released a declassified version of a whistleblower complaint regarding President Donald Trump\u2019s interactions with the Ukrainian president", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/zelensky-trump-split-gty-ps-190925_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
