Then my breathing stopped.\n\n\u2018Esther dumped by BBC for Lowri,\u2019 was printed in inch-high letters across the front page. Just in case there was any doubt they were talking about me, the piece was accompanied by my photograph.\n\nThat was a fortnight ago and my phone hasn\u2019t stopped ringing. Friends, colleagues, even distant acquaintances who have evidently decided I might be useful have called to congratulate me.\n\nWhat Lowri Turner wrote when she was first interviewed by Femail around 50 years ago\n\nNiceties over, they all ask the same question: \u2018So, how much are you really earning?\u2019 Estimates of my salary were rising by \u00a3100,000 a day.\n\nMy carpenter arrived clutching a copy of The Mirror and suggested I might like to review his daily rate.\n\nI got a call from a girlfriend who often gives me a lift to the supermarket. \u2018I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll be coming to Safeway with me any more,\u2019 she said.\n\nA fortnight later, I find myself running through lists of ex-boyfriends to work out who will sell their story and who won\u2019t.\n\nI am currently fantasising about an appearance in Hello! I look forward to posing with a Labrador and some Laura Ashley wallpaper soon.\n\nIt is assumed that once you are successful, you automatically feel more self-confident.\n\nThe problem is you have to watch yourself on screen, and this is really painful. I just sit there and think: \u2018Oh God, my eyes look really baggy.\u2019\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say that reaching a certain level doesn\u2019t make you feel good.\n\nWHAT I DID NEXT\n\nTwenty years after my sudden elevation to minor TV celebrity, it seems like another life.\n\nToday, I\u2019m a nutritionist and hypnotherapist specialising in weight loss.\n\nBack in the late Nineties, I\u2019d just signed a mega-deal with the BBC to present makeover shows and a chat show with my name above the door.\n\nBlimey, I thought I\u2019d arrived.\n\nLowri Turner has now written to explain what happened after her landmark article\n\nThe problem was that being famous didn\u2019t make me happy. Going out on a Saturday night became a no-no because drunk strangers would stagger up and want to be my new best friend.\n\nI learned to sit with my back to any window in a restaurant or people would stare as I ate.\n\nOne especially low point came when I was in a gym and a woman very slowly scanned my naked body and announced: \u2018You look slimmer on the telly.\u2019\n\nYes, there were some fantastic moments. When I was hosting a series in Birmingham, the Beeb paid for a chauffeur. On the way back from filming, he used to double park the Merc outside Marks & Spencer and heft my shopping into the boot. Now that\u2019s my idea of luxury.\n\nDrunks would stagger up and want to be my new best friend\n\nStill, I think, looking back, I was a square peg in a round hole. While most female TV presenters back then were former models and actresses, I was from the much more obstreperous school of Fleet Street journalism.\n\nI chafed at being told what to do and say.\n\nMy battles with my weight didn\u2019t help. In the Nineties, it really did pay to be slim for a career in TV. I tried to keep my weight down, but all the pressure led to anxiety, which resulted in overeating. I dieted like a maniac to become a size 6, but I could never maintain it.\n\nWithin six months, I would yo-yo wildly between a size 8 and a 14 (now I\u2019m a stable size 10).\n\nThen I tried to get pregnant, but was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and put on steroids \u2014 which inflated me further. When I did get pregnant, my boss phoned to say she\u2019d watched the show \u2018to see how big you\u2019d got\u2019.\n\nI needed to regain control of my life \u2014 and television was changing, too, with the advent of reality programmes.\n\nSo, 13 years ago, I began studying nutrition and hypnotherapy and, ten years ago, I saw my first client. I chose weight loss because of my own torrid dieting history. If anyone knows how it feels to be out of control with food, it\u2019s me.\n\nI have gradually regained my anonymity, something I didn\u2019t realise was precious until I didn\u2019t have it.\n\nToday, my life is less glamorous, but I enjoy it. Corny as it sounds, it is fulfilling helping other people. I no longer have to try to live up to an image and, as a result, I feel calmer, happier and am also slimmer than I ever was as a TV presenter.", "description": "Femail reveals what happened to celebrity Lowri Turner, who was made famous by TV around 50 years ago.
