Now, the Swedish government has approved the ability of 15-year-olds to undergo the process even without the consent of their parents or guardians, broadcaster SVT reports.\n\nThe number of young children claiming to have gender dysphoria in Sweden has surged in recent years.\n\nSVT found a government document from 2014 used as the basis for the new legislation that claims young people with the condition take their own lives while waiting for surgery. However, the broadcaster could not find an expert who could corroborate the report, which had no citation.\n\nThe broadcaster claims that no doctors they spoke to knew of any cases of transgender minors taking their own lives while waiting for gender reassignment. They had said, however, they had experienced more of a problem with those who had had operations and later regretted it.\n\nSwedish Hospital Defends Removing Breasts of 14-Year-Old Diagnosed with \u2018Gender Dysphoria\u2019 https://t.co/HqKazbfRzf \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 5, 2019\n\nProfessor of psychiatry and Sweden\u2019s leading expert on suicide Danuta Wasserman said that more focus should put on suicide prevention. \u201cEvidence shows very clearly in suicide prevention that the conversation should be conducted for young adolescents who are at puberty, before puberty, and after puberty. There are many evidence-based treatments,\u201d she said.\n\nAleksa Lundberg, an actor and journalist, said that despite having gender reassignment surgery to become a woman at just 18, she still felt gender dysphoria.\n\n\u201cWith everything I know today, I couldn\u2019t have lived as a feminine gay guy? But had it been possible to live in that body or had gender dysphoria eaten me up? I do not know,\u201d Lundberg said.\n\nEarlier this year, the Karolinska University Hospital admitted to having performed breast removal surgery on a girl who was only 14. Per-Anders Rydelius, a senior physician at Karolinska, labelled the operation \u201cquite reasonable\u201d.", "description": "The Swedish government has proposed allowing children as young as 15 to undergo gender reassignment surgery.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/gender-identity-break-the-binary-transgender-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
