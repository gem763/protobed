We\u2019ve been down this investigative road before.\n\nHere\u2019s the hope eternal side of things: \u201cNearly every U.S. state jumps into Google antitrust probe,\u201d Politico wrote.\n\nThat headline comes as eight other states, days ago, announced a separate investigation into the dominance of Facebook\u2019s market. And that comes as the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have jumped into investigative mode as well, announcing queries into the competitive practices \u2014 or lack of \u2014 of some of Big Tech\u2019s biggest.\n\nOn the latest, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the states will consider \u201cwhether large tech companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition, restricted access and harmed consumers,\u201d ABC News reported.\n\nSounds dramatic, right? Indeed.\n\nBut truly, it would be nice if this didn\u2019t end up being all for show.\n\nIt\u2019d be nice if these investigations actually led to something more than CEO denials of censorship and CEO promises to quote, unquote \u201cdo better\u201d \u2014 whatever that would mean \u2014 and collective hand-raising and shoulder-shrugging of nonetheless properly outraged politicians.\n\nThing is, we\u2019ve been here before.\n\nAnd nobody knows that better than the objects of these investigations.\n\nAs Kent Walker, Google\u2019s chief legal officer, wrote in a widely reported blog post: \u201cWe have answered many questions on these issues over many years, in the United States as well as overseas, across many aspects of our business, so this is not new for us.\u201d\n\nIn other words: Nothing to see here, folks. Go home.\n\nThe fact is Alphabet Inc., the parent of Google, gives big money to political causes and candidates, mostly aligned with the Democrat Party.\n\nThe Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 OpenSecrets.org site found that in this current 2020 political cycle, Alphabet has so far donated $1.54 million to Democrats versus $208,397 to Republicans. The 87%-12% split is the widest it\u2019s been for years; in 2018, Alphabet gave a total of $6.04 million to Democrats and $1.25 to Republicans \u2014 a difference of 73% versus 15%. And in 2016, the company gave $5.73 million to Democrats, versus $2.07 million to Republicans, which breaks down to 62% for liberals and 23% percent for conservatives.\n\n\u201cSince 2004, Alphabet employees have contributed a little over 90% of their political dollars to Democratic candidates and causes,\u201d GovPredict reported in 2018.\n\nAnd in 2018 alone, \u201cAlphabet Inc., Google\u2019s parent company, [spent] more than $21.7 million on lobbying \u2014 a more than 40 percent increase from two years prior,\u201d the website FollowTheMoney.org reported.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just at the federal level that the Alphabet money is rolling.\n\n\u201cIn the last seven years,\u201d FollowTheMoney.org reported in August, \u201cApple, Amazon, Facebook and Google spent more than $24.3 million lobbying in \u2026 20 states.\u201d\n\nThe money trail runs long.\n\nAnd it weaves around some interesting rabbit holes, populated by politicians of all walks, of all types, of all persuasions.\n\nNow add in the free market and there\u2019s your answer on why Big Tech has been able to wield and wave its censorship wand for so long.\n\nBig Tech, in the end, is Big Money.\n\nSo long as the money continues to flow \u2014 so long as America\u2019s markets continue to be free \u2014 it\u2019s hard to see how any investigations will bring any change at all.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
