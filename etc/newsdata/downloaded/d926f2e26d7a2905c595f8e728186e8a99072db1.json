New beginning.'\n\nThe insider dished: 'Her No. 1 priority is meeting someone who can build a strong relationship with Suri. If they don\u2019t tick that box, Katie\u2019s just not interested.'\n\nAlthough the breakup reports with Jamie only really took off in mid-August, Page Six reports Katie told friends around then that 'we haven't been together for months.'\n\nFamily time: Katie, who shares her child with her ex-husband Tom Cruise, wrapped a camel-colored coat over a double-denim ensemble\n\nThe conjecture got going after Jamie, who doubles as a record producer, was glimpsed on August 17 holding hands with singer Sela Vave as he emerged from the Los Angeles nightclub Bootsy Bellows.\n\nSela and Jamie have both denied rumors of a romance between them, insisting that he is just helping her out professionally - as he had with male celebrities earlier in their careers.\n\nKatie and Jamie's last public appearance as a couple was a glamorous jaunt on the first Monday in May to the Met Gala, where his shoes matched her Zac Posen gown.\n\nThe duo went public as a couple in late 2017, though there had been speculation they were an item since four years earlier.\n\nOn the go: Sweeping her dark hair back into a bun, she accessorized with a pair of butterfly shades and slung a canvas bag over one shoulder\n\nThere was a swirl of rumors that Katie's divorce agreement prohibited her from publicly dating anyone for five years after the split with Tom.\n\nShe initially began dating Tom in 2005, and seven weeks into the relationship, they were engaged. Their Scientologist wedding was held at the Castello Orsini-Odescalchi in Bracciano in November 2006, seven months after Suri was born.\n\nKatie filed in 2012 for a divorce that was finalized only 10 days later, with Suri's mother retaining primary custody, though Tom could visit, according to People.\n\nRon Miscavige, father of Scientology leader David Miscavige, told MailOnline in 2016 that Katie's misgivings about Scientology - including the effect it could have on Suri - contributed to her decision to leave Tom.", "description": "She has been a street style maven in the wake of her split from Jamie Foxx.
