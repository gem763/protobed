Those two unions together represent about 35,000 workers, tens of thousands of whom have been picketing this week outside their schools and flooding Chicago\u2019s downtown center. The CTU is arguing for higher pay to keep up with Chicago\u2019s mounting cost of living, alongside a long list of other requests, including smaller class sizes, more school nurses and librarians, funding for bilingual education, and access to affordable housing for teachers and their students, an estimated 16,450 of whom are homeless.\n\nThe city contends that the teachers are asking for more than the city can afford, and Lane says she printed out and used some of CPS management\u2019s emails as \u201cprimary-source documents\u201d to teach labor history and illuminate both sides of the struggle. (A CPS spokesperson said the district sent out an email to families the day before the strike noting the deal that management was offering, in addition to issuing other updates about the strike; the leaders of individual schools may have sent out their own messages in some cases.) Lane also showed video clips summarizing both parties\u2019 points of view, explained what the teachers were fighting for, and answered students\u2019 more pressing concerns, such as whether they\u2019d have to make up any strike-canceled days at the end of the school year. So far, CPS says they won\u2019t.\n\nYounger grade levels, meanwhile, don\u2019t get quite as comprehensive an education in labor policy. But even in elementary school, Lane says the strike comes up in the classroom: Friends of hers who teach in lower grade levels told her that they spent time before the strike deadline reading aloud children\u2019s books on labor issues.\n\nLes Plewa, a teacher at Taft Freshman Academy, started teaching the strike in his civics classes two days before the strike deadline. Like Lane, Plewa says he wanted to present enough information to enable his students to come to their own position on the strike. The day before the strike, Plewa says, a student who doesn\u2019t normally talk much came up to him and said he really enjoys the class, something Plewa thinks was prompted by his breaking down the strike and the issues behind it. \u201cSometimes the public doesn\u2019t realize the effort teachers put in in terms of helping students understand,\u201d he says.\n\nPlewa also thinks it\u2019s important to give students some perspective on \u201cwhat other districts have in terms of resources\u2014the students can\u2019t understand what they\u2019re missing if they don\u2019t know about it.\u201d\n\nFor example, Karen Zaccor, who teaches science at Uplift Community High School, in Uptown, says she brought up in a class discussion that the school hasn\u2019t had a librarian in several years. She said that in conversations about the strike, many students were able to grasp some of the sharpest perceived injustices in the system, such as the pay discrepancies between teachers and special-education classroom aides. (In Lane\u2019s class, sports funding and building repairs\u2014most of her school\u2019s campus was built in 1932\u2014were issues that students immediately connected with.)", "description": "\u201cI asked the kids, \u2018Do you want to know what we\u2019re fighting about?\u2019\u201d said one teacher.
