For a start their jobs would be spared. GM previously slated the plant for closure by January. Instead, its 700 employees could start building electric pickup trucks next year.\n\nBut as the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike appears to be ending, after more than a month, emotions outside the plant were decidedly mixed last week. Those who spoke with the Guardian said their feelings fell somewhere between \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d and \u201cskeptical\u201d as a slow trickle of news came from UAW leadership.\n\nThe union released an outline of the deal last week but the details are still only known to \u201cthe guys at the bargaining table\u201d, said Paul Radatz, a 34-year company veteran. Over the weekend UAW members were getting to grips with those details. Voting started on Saturday and is expected to be completed by Friday.\n\n\u201cWhat we hear so far all sounds good, but that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do \u2013 come out and tell us all the highlights,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this happens with every contract, and there are always things that we have lost that don\u2019t come out until it\u2019s ratified and in print. So we\u2019re waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u201d\n\nAn hour north in Flint, D\u2019Andre Jackson, a UAW district committee representative said workers at the Flint assembly plant shared that sentiment. While there\u2019s some optimism, \u201cthere\u2019s some anxiety\u201d over what isn\u2019t yet known.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see just the shiny chrome pieces. I want to see the meat and potatoes,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nThe strike has cost GM $100m a day, according to analysts, and there\u2019s no doubt that the UAW has won some significant concessions, a major victory for the union after its longest strike in 10 years. Workers are also feeling ebullient about the resurgence of unions, which are gaining ground as teachers and others have successfully campaigned for wage rises and more. But striking takes its toll.\n\nOn a cold and windy Thursday small groups of employees waved signs outside the six entrances around the sprawling, 4m sq ft Detroit-Hamtramck plant just a few miles north of GM\u2019s downtown headquarters. They warmed themselves around fires burning in 55-gallon drums and pumped fists as passing motorists hit their horns in solidarity.\n\nThe highlights of the deal that UAW workers are processing include $11,000 ratification bonuses, paths to full-time employment for temporary workers, pay increases, no changes to healthcare, and other clear wins for the union. The UAW national General Motors council decided on Thursday to recommend ratification, and the rank and file will now vote on it.\n\nAt least one obvious sticking point remains. Some outside Detroit-Hamtramck vowed to vote against any deal that didn\u2019t also include new product for the recently shuttered Lordstown, Ohio, plant.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest United Auto Workers members picket outside General Motors Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly in Detroit last week.

He noted that the $11,000 bonuses pale in comparison to the roughly $11,000 per hour that GM\u2019s CEO, Mary Berra, earns. He and others say they aren\u2019t convinced that GM ever truly planned to close Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly because the company invested big in it in recent years, while rumors of an electric truck started months ago. Radatz called the proposal to close the plant a false \u201cnegotiating chip\u201d.\n\n\u201cNow they can say, \u2018See, we\u2019re bargaining in good faith,\u2019 but they haven\u2019t been. That\u2019s a joke,\u201d Radatz said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t blame them. You want to have an ace up your sleeve.\u201d\n\nFeelings outside Detroit-Hamtramck were also mixed over building electric trucks. While the plant may live to see another day, some are disappointed the company is only promising \u201ca low volume\u201d vehicle that\u2019s viewed as a \u201ctest product to see how the public takes to it\u201d. But Julaynne Trusel, a team leader in the body shop, said it beats the alternative.\n\n\u201cThe doors are staying open and everyone doesn\u2019t need to start looking for jobs, so at least it\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully we get some more business over the life of the contract.\u201d\n\nThough there\u2019s still some frustration over the bitter fight that played out in recent years and culminated with the strike, employees don\u2019t expect any resentment to linger should the stoppage conclude. After all, the two sides were just \u201clooking out for themselves\u201d, Trusel said.\n\n\u201cThis is just business and everyone had to handle their business,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we come back together, we are going to be like one. We all want to produce the best cars that we can for our customers, so we\u2019re not going back in with a bad attitude.\u201d\n\nGeorge Raptis, a materials department employee who has been at Detroit-Hamtramck since 1993, echoed that: \u201cWe all want to get back to work, and when we do things will go on like it\u2019s another day.\u201d\n\nThe stoppage, which is the longest GM has faced since 1970, is inflicting pain on both sides. About 48,000 UAW workers, including 17,000 in Michigan, walked off the job. GM has lost more than $1.5bn because of the strike, while union workers lost more than $835m in wages, according to the East Lansing industry analyst Anderson Economic Group. Union workers are earning just $250 a week, and GM temporarily pulled their health insurance last month.\n\n\u201c$250 per week is less than my spousal payment, so I\u2019m in the hole,\u201d said a Detroit-Hamtramck body shop employee and 35-year company veteran who declined to give his name. In Flint, Jackson delayed renovations on a new house he and his wife purchased not long before the strike.\n\n\u201cYou definitely tighten up the belt and fry up a couple bologna sandwiches instead of grilling up some steaks,\u201d he said.\n\nTrusel added that support from other unions and the public helped get workers through financial difficulties. Those picketing outside the plant received free meals and donations of food, diapers, toiletries and other essentials.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so much support for us. It brings you to tears to know that people care so much,\u201d Trusel said. \u201cIt\u2019s been encouraging to know that so many people are saying \u2018Stand your ground\u2019.\u201d\n\nShould the union come away with a win and public support for workers remain high, the strike could be a shot in the arm for the UAW and the largely beleaguered US labor movement. Radatz applauded leadership for \u201clocking horns with GM\u201d and said its handling of the strike so far has restored the rank and file\u2019s faith.\n\n\u201cThe union was very weak before the contract and now it\u2019s solid,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are standing with each other and they\u2019re backing each other 110%.\u201d", "description": "Feelings ranged from \u2018cautiously optimistic\u2019 to \u2018skeptical\u2019 among striking members of the UAW in Michigan as they prepare to vote", "authors": ["Tom Perkins"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ef8f783047b8beac14fdf6405a85038c2819d27/0_31_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=16aa2e4bc03c39f668ab4fe375aaf4a9", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
