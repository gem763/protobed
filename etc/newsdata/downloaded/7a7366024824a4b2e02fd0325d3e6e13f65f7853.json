Ditto Nurofen Express Period Pain capsules when compared with Nurofen Express Liquid capsules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all in the marketing,\u201d explains Urquhart, a pharmacist of over 18 years. \u201cThe drugs are usually the same, but patients may not realise the original brand is good for period pain, as for example, they may previously have taken them for an ankle injury. It\u2019s understandable why some patients and customers get confused when selecting a product.\u201d\n\nHence the clever marketers who jazz up the packaging with typically \u201cfeminine\u201d colours to draw in those with beastly cramps looking for instant relief. The only difference, is sometimes the price. But, this is great to know if you've ever paced the aisles of Boots freaking out because the period-designed pain relief are all out of stock, thinking other varieties won't quite cut it.\n\nPhoto credit: Getty Images More\n\nSo what would Urquhart advise for treating the pain of monthly womb torture? As a first line treatment, he recommends ibuprofen or aspirin, however, these aren\u2019t suitable for everyone (for example those with asthma or stomach, kidney or liver problems). Aspirin should not be taken by anyone under 16 years of age, either.\n\n\n\n\u201cParacetamol is another option, but studies have shown that it does not reduce pain as well as ibuprofen or aspirin. Stronger painkillers such as naproxen (Feminax Ultra) or codeine containing painkillers can be purchased from pharmacies as second line treatment too [if the former suggestions are ineffective].\u201d\n\nOther non-medicinal options include a trusty hot water bottle, quitting smoking (who knew?), exercising and Transcutaneous Electronic Nerve Stimulation (TENS, which to the uninitiated are little machines with patches attached designed to relax muscles). So there you have it, the pink packaging is literally just that... packaging.\n\nJamie Urquhart is a Superintendent Pharmacist for Now Patient, an online pharmacy and GP service.\n\nFollow Jennifer on Twitter and Instagram\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Aside from being packaged in pink and costing more money.", "authors": ["Jennifer Savin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Yq86lN3ueadveblQMFpTQw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/3d62a071fb91ccadc6353d515dd95c9c", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
