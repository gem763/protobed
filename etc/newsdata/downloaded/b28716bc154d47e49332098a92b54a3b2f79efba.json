The group will continue its mission of acting as the agency\u2019s research wing into new financial technology, including blockchain and cryptocurrency tools.\n\nLabCFTC has fallen under the CFTC Office of General Counsel\u2019s oversight since its formation in 2017, Tarbert said in prepared remarks shared with CoinDesk.\n\nRelated: How to Watch Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Grilling in Congress Today\n\n\u201cIn its new capacity, LabCFTC will continue to be focused on both internal and external innovation,\u201d he said. This will include keeping the agency\u2019s employees up to date on new technology, adopting technological tools that the CFTC can use in its enforcement and anti-market manipulation missions, and continuing to gather input from industry participants.\n\nThe group was originally created \u201cto be a beachhead\u201d for blockchain and digital assets, as well as other financial technology developments, according to a press release. Since its creation the group has published an educational primer on smart contracts and a request for information on the ethereum cryptocurrency.\n\nThe group was headed up by Daniel Gorfine, who has since left the agency, and is now overseen by Melissa Netram, who was previously Intuit\u2019s director of global public policy and regulatory affairs.\n\nLabCFTC will continue \u201cto play an even greater role\u201d as the regulator writes rules for these new products.\n\nRelated: US Treasury to Monitor Libra Over Possible Financial Risks\n\nIn his remarks, Tarbert said \u201cour agency\u2019s vision is to be the global standard for sound derivatives regulation,\u201d adding:\n\n\u201cI want the agency to be the resource for you to help identify ways those technologies could fit into the current regulatory structure. Now that LabCFTC\u2019s success has been demonstrated, we want to solidify its position within the agency. Now it will take on an even bigger role here at the CFTC and be a critical link to innovators for years, and perhaps decades, to come.\u201d\n\nAs part of its efforts, LabCFTC published a primer on artificial intelligence and its role in financial markets on Thursday, as part of an ongoing series of educational materials on new tools.\n\nThe primer defines artificial intelligence, outlines historical work in the field and notes how it might benefit the CFTC and its work overseeing commodity derivatives markets.\n\nIn a statement, Netram said \u201cprogress depends on how well regulators respond to financial innovation.\u201d\n\nHer division is \u201cat the forefront\u201d of evaluating new tools, she said. Artificial intelligence in particular could help improve the derivatives markets the CFTC oversees.\n\nHeath Tarbert testifies before the Senate Banking Committee, May 2017\n\nRelated Stories", "description": "The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is upgrading its financial technology research wing, LabCFTC, into an independent office.", "authors": ["Nikhilesh De"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BkVAMMfGA2Ctu3gEvvgJ2g--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/e599cb69e9c052b59f300099ff0bcca7", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
