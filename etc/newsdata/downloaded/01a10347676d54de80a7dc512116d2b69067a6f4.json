The company\u2019s shares and bonds tumbled, and the cost to insure against default surged.\n\nSteven Keenan, Apache\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide exploration, resigned two days ago, company spokesman Phil West said in an email on Friday. The geologist\u2019s departure may fuel concerns about the fate of Apache\u2019s search for crude in Suriname, adjacent to an Exxon Mobil Corp. discovery that\u2019s one of the world\u2019s biggest finds in years.\n\n\u201cMr. Keenan\u2019s resignation is not connected to Suriname,\u201d West said. \u201cThe drill bit is still above the first target zone in the Suriname well.\u201d\u2019\n\nApache may provide an update on the progress of its exploratory efforts across the 1.4-million-acre offshore tract known as Block 58 as soon as Oct. 30, when the Houston-based company is scheduled to report third-quarter results.\n\nThe shares fell as much as 11% on Friday for the biggest intraday drop since January 2016. The stock was down 5.6% to $21.93 at 1:34 p.m.\n\nThe cost to insure against an Apache default jumped to the highest since August 2016. Five-year credit-default swaps tied to the company were among the worst performers in the investment-grade CDS market, widening to as much as 31 basis points on a day when the overall market tightened by 1.2 basis points.\n\n\u2018Investment Case\u2019\n\nThe yield on Apache\u2019s most actively traded bond, 4.375% notes that mature in 2028, widened by 21 basis points, according to Trace, and were among the most actively traded notes in the investment-grade market.\n\nAs recently as last week, Bank of America Merrill Lynch touted the Suriname prospect as potentially game-changing for Apache.\n\nIt \u201chas potential to reset the investment case,\u201d Merrill Lynch\u2019s veteran oil-industry analyst Doug Leggate said in an Oct. 18 note to clients. On the strength of that thesis, Leggate upgraded his rating on the stock and said a single good well could translate into a $6-a-share benefit for Apache.\n\nKeenan was hand-picked by Apache\u2019s then-Chief Executive Officer Steve Farris in 2014 to replicate the dramatic discoveries he oversaw for EOG Resources Inc. in the Eagle Ford shale basin in South Texas.\n\nNot long after he joined Apache, the company announced its Alpine High discovery in a little-drilled corner of the Permian Basin in West Texas. At the time, the company said the play held 3 billion barrels of crude and 75 trillion cubic feet of gas.\n\nBut Apache\u2019s stock has underperformed rival producers since it first touted the Alpine High find, which turned out to be far richer in gas than more valuable crude.\n\n(Adds timing of exploration chief\u2019s departure in second paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Kriti Gupta and Elizabeth Rembert.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Rachel Adams-Heard in Houston at radamsheard@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net, Joe Carroll, Carlos Caminada\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The high-profile geologist leading one of Apache Corp.\u2019s most-important exploration ventures has stepped down.
