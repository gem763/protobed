They were all good players, of course, and when Elliot Easton had to, he could shred on guitar. But for the most part, everything was very simple and in its place and arranged very nicely. There\u2019ve been times when I thought I must have gotten that from The Pixies. But no, it goes back to The Cars.\n\nRead: How The Cars Upgraded Rock and Roll\n\nThey\u2019re one of the biggest influences not necessarily in the way I write songs but the way I arrange of them. And the attitude as well. They\u2019re singing about the same girl that The Everly Brothers and Buddy Holly sang about, but this time she\u2019s got drip-dry gloves and nuclear boots and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll hair. It\u2019s not jokey. It\u2019s just something a little off.\n\nSpencer Kornhaber: What works about that syncopated riff?\n\nNewman: It\u2019s just in the pocket. They\u2019re locked in like a machine. It\u2019s on the off beat but you can feel the other beat in there. I love how Elliott Easton\u2019s high guitar only comes in every bar or two.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re All I\u2019ve Got Tonight\u201d (1978)\n\nNewman: We\u2019d been practicing when we found out he died and I had my guitar in my hand. That was the first thing that occurred to me to play: [mimics riff from \u201cYou\u2019re All I\u2019ve Got Tonight\u201d]. Such a monstrous, simple guitar hook.\n\nThat whole first album, it\u2019s hard for me to talk about the songs separately. \u201cGood Times Roll,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re All I\u2019ve Got Tonight,\u201d and \u201cJust What I Needed,\u201d and \u201cMy Best Friend\u2019s Girl\u201d\u2014they all seem like they\u2019re of a piece. It\u2019s so rare for a band to come out of the gate that good and that immediate.\n\nSome records that people talk about as the greatest of all time have something more cerebral going on. Like [The Beach Boys\u2019] Pet Sounds or [The Zombies\u2019] Odessey and Oracle or [Love\u2019s] Forever Changes, which are albums that I really adore. Albums like the first Cars album don\u2019t get enough credit. Because from the second you hear them, they plug into your pleasure zones. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve always admired: the ability to be interesting but so immediate at the same time. You can\u2019t dismiss it as Top 40 radio rock because they invented it. That was basically the beginning of the \u201980s sound, but it happened in \u201978 and \u201979.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s Go\u201d (1979)\n\nNewman: It seems like an empty gesture to start looking for deep cuts by The Cars, because most of their songs were hits, and their hits were generally the best songs. \u201cLet\u2019s Go\u201d takes me back to a very specific place. I remember being a kid and being at the Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver. All the rides are lit up and \u201cLet\u2019s Go\u201d by The Cars is playing. The chorus hits\u2014\u201cI like the night life, baby!\u201d My mind took a snapshot of that moment, looking up at the Mad Mouse or whatever ride it was and thinking, \u201cThis is so cool.\u201d It\u2019s only years later when I become a musician and I think, \u201cI love the groove of the song, I love the keyboard line, I love the way the bass works.\u201d", "description": "A.
