One of the questions on the survey asks respondents to report their families' ancestries.\n\nUsing individual-level data from the Minnesota Population Center's Integrated Public Use Microdata Series for the 2017 American Community Survey, we found the total number of respondents in each state reporting various ancestries as either their first or second response to that question.\n\nAbout 83% of respondents listed at least one ancestry. The following maps show the percentage of those who gave at least one answer that said they had a particular ancestry for 17 of the most common ancestries in the US.", "description": "Irish ancestry is most common in the Northeast, while Mexican and Mexican-American ancestry dominates in the states that share a border with Mexico.", "authors": ["Andy Kiersz"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5911fe4573f2f34f008b4cf6-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
