David Luiz might not be performing heroics for Arsenal at the moment, but he has done for Brazil over the years. How did he get this over the bar? If it\u2019s athleticism you appreciate most in a last-ditch clearance, see Kyle Walker and Sven van Beek. Meanwhile, this defender put so much effort into his clearance that he broke the goal in Brazil. Oh, and brilliant goalline clearances are not always performed by humans, either, as this stray dog showed in a third-tier match in Argentina.\n\n2) College football is properly back with a \u2026 well, just watch this.\n\nTimothy Burke (@bubbaprog) OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD pic.twitter.com/hRJHaBlX61\n\n3) Rafael Nadal couldn\u2019t get the ball over the net in his fourth-round match against Marin Cilic at the US Open \u2026 so he just went round it with an absurd winner. It was brilliant, and even had Tiger Woods fist-pumping in the crowd \u2026 but better than Novak Djokovic\u2019s in 2014? You decide.\n\n4) Bone-crunching NRL tackle alert!
