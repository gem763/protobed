A decision by the Marine Corps is pending legal guidance from the Secretary of the Navy and the Pentagon, an official said.\n\nIs vaping safer than smoking? Depends who you ask, and what scientific study they point to\n\nThe U.S. Army Public Health Center warned soldiers last month to avoid e-cigarettes and vaping products, saying their use could affect fighting strength, readiness and resilience.\n\nThe message, directed at soldiers as well as their families, especially warned against using vaping products sold off the street or modified. It said the effects of vaping could undermine the military's mission.\n\n\"In efforts to conserve the fighting strength, and strengthen Army readiness and resilience, vaping of e-cigarettes should be highly discouraged at this time,\" said Dr. Marc A. Williams, a toxicologist and an e-cigarette and vaping expert in APHC's Toxicology Directorate.\n\nWilliams said Army researchers have found that vaping might be associated with anxiety, increased blood pressure and seizures.\n\n\"It should be considered a myth that vaping is less harmful than conventional cigarette smoking,\" he said.\n\nVaping epidemic:Juul CEO resigns as company suspends advertising Read this:E-cigarette sales discontinued at Walgreens, Kroger as crisis continues\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week reported 1,080 cases of vaping-related lung illness and 18 deaths in a survey of 48 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nSymptoms appear over the course of a few days to several weeks and include cough, shortness of breath or chest pain, in addition to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, fever or weight loss.\n\nWilliams said the \"lack of quality control\" in the manufacture of the devices and products \"should make us all deeply skeptical or at least questioning of the general safety of these devices.\"\n\nA recent study by the Mayo Clinic said lung illnesses may be caused by \"toxic chemical fumes.\"\n\nThe findings, published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine, were based on the biopsies of 17 people with confirmed or possible cases of vaping-related lung injuries, including two patients who died.\n\nAll of the subjects had a history of vaping; 71% of them used marijuana or cannabis oils.", "description": "Days after the sale of e-cigarettes were banned from Army bases, two soldiers have been diagnosed with vaping-related lung injuries", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/09/USAT/c51376b3-07d5-4bc3-bba9-7780a6ae0039-AFP_AFP_1KD4LU.JPG?crop=4987,3741,x6,y0&width=3200&height=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
