But it\u2019s also a business where the goal is to make money.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Golden State Warriors, in the new Chase Center in San Francisco, are raking in the money. A LOT of money. More than any other team in the league and it\u2019s not even close.\n\nFrom Tim Kawakami of The Athletic:\n\nStarting this inaugural Chase season, it\u2019s estimated that the Warriors will take in about $700 million in annual revenue for the foreseeable future. This about $250-300 million more than the Knicks or Lakers, the next-highest NBA teams, and possibly more than even any NFL team, \u201cexcept maybe the Cowboys,\u201d one source said\u2026 The Warriors are set to take in about $5 million in gate receipts per game, before costs are subtracted from the total.\n\nBased on Forbes estimates, the Cowboys would generate more money, but that\u2019s it. Not the Rams, Patriots, you name the team they pull in less revenue than the Warriors\u2019 new building. The league has never seen a revenue-generating machine like the Chase Center, and while this is revenue before expenses, it\u2019s still a lot of cash in the door.\n\nThis is why Lacob and Guber had their eyes on building a San Francisco arena all along \u2014 the glamor of the team\u2019s historic success plus the entertainment value of Curry & Co. plus the lure of an international city stacked with billionaires and a building that is crammed with amenities \u2026 that\u2019s the unprecedented formula.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of that money will flow into the pockets of players, don\u2019t forget the players get approximately half the \u201cbasketball-related income\u201d that comes into the league and some of that money is ticket sales, luxury box sales and the like. Also, there is some revenue sharing between owners, so smaller markets will get a taste, too.\n\nMostly, however, this is a lot of money that flows to the Warriors\u2019 owners. It doesn\u2019t mean they can spend more on the team \u2014 there is still a salary cap, and while the owners may be more willing to pay the luxury tax now, the rules for taxpayers hamstrings team building in other ways. However, in terms of facilities, coaches, front office staff, and the other things that do not count against the cap, the Warriors owners can spend what they want.\n\nAnd still make a lot of money.", "description": "The only NFL team to generate more stadium revenue now than the Warriors is the Cowboys.", "authors": ["Kurt Helin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xCvi5_hZGCV6ABNifRG51g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjAuNDcxNTEyNzcwMTM3Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kFUd3HX0vbIumPEgQ0didw--~B/aD01NzM7dz0xMDE4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/99f31a9b097137b18582c548f2335e82", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
