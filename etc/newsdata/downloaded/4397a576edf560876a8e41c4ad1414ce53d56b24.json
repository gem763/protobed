California Sen. Kamala Harris, who was then in second place after a strong showing in the first Democratic debate, has plummeted 13 percentage points and is now in a three-way tie for sixth. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earned 9% support, the same number as in the June poll.\n\n\u201cIowa is unquestionably up for grabs,\u201d said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk Political Research Center. Buttigieg \u201chas found a lane and is accelerating toward the front of the pack, surpassing Bernie Sanders. All of this is happening while the number of undecided voters continues to grow as Democratic caucusgoers pause to reevaluate the changing field.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Usa Today", "Usatoday.Com Story News Politics Elections Iowa-Caucuses-Pete-Buttigieg-Elizabeth-Warren-Joe-Biden-Top-Poll"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
