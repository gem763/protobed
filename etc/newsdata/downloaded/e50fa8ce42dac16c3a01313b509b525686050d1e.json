He has won 30 Tour de France stages in his career, placing him second on the all time list behind only Eddy Merckx.\n\nIt is likely that the former Dimension Data will have some sort of performance-related clause in his deal, however, with an extension almost certainly contingent on success.", "description": "Mark Cavendish will be formally announced on Friday as a Bahrain-McLaren rider, signing a contract which is likely to see him through to the conclusion of his career.", "authors": ["Tom Cary", "Cycling Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cycling/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000202557602-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqejI1gRHJsOsGt35KcRG67xws2wuoei9M_HFF16UY7UM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
