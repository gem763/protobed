There\u2019s G.M.\u2019s Mary Barra, who was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for refusing to recall millions of cars with an ignition glitch, which ultimately caused 13 deaths. Not one but two now former Wells Fargo chief executives said they were \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the company profiting by such means as setting up fake bank accounts for their unknowing customers. Equifax was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for permitting lax conditions that resulted in the largest credit hack in American history, while BP head Tony Hayward told a House hearing he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the BP oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nA few years ago, I called these executives\u2019 congressional apology tours a \u201cgreat charade\u201d in American life, designed to ensure that business continues on as usual. Boeing and Muilenburg is the latest example of that.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Lion Air crash in Indonesia that killed 189 people last October and the Ethiopian Airlines crash responsible for the deaths of another 157 passengers and crew were caused, at least in part, by flaws in the Boeing 737 Max\u2019s automated operating system, a technology known as MCAS. It has subsequently emerged that as the company rushed the jet to the finish line, it ignored multiple warnings from pilots and engineers about flaws in the MCAS system and the Boeing work culture behind it.\n\nYet in the immediate aftermath of the two horrific crashes, Boeing appeared most concerned with the safety of company profits, not the passengers on its troubled plane. Even after the second crash, Muilenburg resisted even temporarily grounding the 737 Max to get to the bottom of what caused the horrific deaths. As other countries \u2014 Canada, China, European nations, Singapore \u2014 banned the plane from their airspace, he pleaded his case to President Trump, but to no avail. Thanks to public and congressional pressure, the FAA put the plane on temporary ice.\n\nOnly months after the first crash did Boeing even admit the company was at fault. In April, Muilenburg said he was \u201csorry.\u201d Shocking, I know.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince the crashes, report after report has surfaced of Boeing prioritizing profits over safety and quality in its manufacturing process. A survey of company employees done in 2016 and recently obtained by the Wall Street Journal showed a number of Boeing employees felt under pressure from management when it came to handling safety issues and the FAA\u2019s certification process. Perhaps that\u2019s why another report, this one from U.S. and foreign regulators, released earlier this month determined the company did not provide adequate information to the FAA during the 737 Max\u2019s own certification process. How much Boeing has changed as a response to this horrifying series of events is subject to debate, to say the least. Boeing only informed the FAA this month about the existence of text messages between employees discussing potential issues with the MCAS system \u2014 despite the fact the company knew about them for months.\n\nMuilenburg, who has been Boeing\u2019s chief executive since 2015, believes he is the man to fix all this, telling Congress he\u2019s \u201cresponsible\u201d for fixing what went wrong under his corporate leadership. Under questioning Wednesday, he said he would not resign. He continues to collect his multimillion-dollar salary \u2014 $30 million in cash and stock for 2018. When asked about that, he passed the buck to the company\u2019s board of directors \u2014 of which he was chairman until earlier this month. (Yes, it took almost a year from the date of the Lion Air crash for the rest of Boeing\u2019s board to strip Muilenburg of the role.) In the meantime, the short-term thinking that led to the tragedies that grounded the 737 Max have cost Boeing at least $8 billion \u2014 and those hundreds of lives.\n\nI have no doubt Muilenburg is sorry for all the deaths and lost profits, but if there\u2019s one thing the events of the past years and the two days of congressional hearings made clear, there\u2019s precious little evidence Boeing\u2019s culture has changed much in response to the double tragedy. No apology, no matter how heartfelt or well meaning, can compensate for that.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "It's an all-too-common refrain, and it isn't helping anyone.", "authors": ["Helaine Olen", "Opinion Writer Focusing On Politics", "Economics", "American Life", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JWT7xsnCgrUmKvp2vWVmlrWal8E=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-30-2019/t_9a588128d281400484ea99fc54f11ab4_name_2___1920x1080___24p_00_01_10_17_Still001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
