Now I just need to try and get the matches, get them consistently, so that I\u2019m used to playing three, four matches in a week,\u201d Murray said.\n\nHe will next play British compatriot Cameron Norrie, who beat Chile\u2019s Cristian Garin on Monday.\n\nAlso in Beijing, top-seeded Dominic Thiem defeated Richard Gasquet 6-4, 6-1 to reach the second round, while American John Isner upset seventh-seeded Gael Monfils of France 6-4, 6-7 (5), 6-3.\n\nIn the women\u2019s tournament, top-ranked Ash Barty advanced to the third round with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Yulia Putintseva. The top-seeded Australian, who has been nursing a calf injury, received a first-round bye after reaching the Wuhan semifinals last week.\n\nThe Roland Garros champion hit 23 winners and seven aces in her first career victory in Beijing.\n\n\u201cI think there were times where it was pretty good and there were times where it was challenging,\u201d Barty said. \u201cOverall pretty happy with how it went today, how we were able to get on a roll in the second set a little bit there.\u201d\n\nNaomi Osaka of Japan extended her win streak to six as she eased past Andrea Petkovic 6-2, 6-0 in just 59 minutes.\n\nIn her first match since winning the Pan Pacific Open in Osaka two weeks ago, the fourth-seeded Osaka won 91% of first-serve points while saving the only break point she faced.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, seventh-seeded Petra Kvitova beat Kristina Mladenovic 6-4, 6-4 while No. 16-seeded Caroline Wozniacki had a 6-4, 6-0 straight-set victory over Christina McHale.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Andy Murray continued his positive return to singles play after hip surgery with a 7-6 (2), 7-6 (7) win over 13th-ranked Matteo Berrettini of Italy in the first round of the China Open on Tuesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
