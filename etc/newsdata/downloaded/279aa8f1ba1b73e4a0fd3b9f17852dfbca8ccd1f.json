The aborted adulthood can prevent the youths from overcoming the commonplace mental-health concerns \u2014 such as teenage angst, depression, or loneliness \u2014 which first caused them to claim transgender status.\n\nTrump also retweeted Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (R):\n\nWe don\u2019t let kids drink alcohol til 21. People want to move smoking age to 21. But we will allow a 7 year old to have his life and body altered like this? This is child abuse and the state should side with the father who is trying to protect the child.\u201d https://t.co/fNXF50qQEY \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) October 24, 2019\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) is also using Twitter to call for an investigation:\n\nThis is horrifying & tragic. For a parent to subject such a young child to life-altering hormone blockers to medically transition their sex is nothing less than child abuse.https://t.co/sl8VcBgfTD via @nypost \u2014 Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) October 24, 2019\n\nThe fight over the boy is likely to expand the nationwide debate over the progressive demand that the government and the public must treat people as members of the opposite sex once they say they are \u201ctransgender.\u201d\n\nSo far, President Donald Trump\u2019s deputies have rejected that demand and instead have issued policies allowing officials and citizens to recognize the biological distinctions between men and women.", "description": "Donald Trump Jr. urged his Twitter followers to protect seven-year-old James Younger from claims that he is a \"transgender\" girl.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Donald-Trump-Jr-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
