If one party wins 170 seats or more, Canada will have a majority government.\n\nIn 2015, Justin Trudeau and his Liberal candidates won 184 seats - a solid majority. Minority governments are formed when no party wins more than half the seats.\n\nA minority government is typically, but not necessarily, formed by the party that has a plurality of seats - but it needs the support of other parties to pass legislation.\n\nA record number of women are standing\n\nElection 43 will also see the largest number of female candidates running ever, with 651 female candidates across all parties, as of 27 September according to Equal Voice Canada, a nonpartisan group that advocates for more women in public office. That represents a 9% increase from 2015.\n\nEqual Voice says it's a \"great stride\" though there remains work to do.\n\n\"If every single woman elected in the history of Canada were to sit together in the House today, they would not fill the Chamber's 338 seats,\" they said in a statement.\n\n\"Following this election, we expect that will finally change.\"\n\nVoters are more concerned about climate change\n\nHealth care is perennial issue of concerns for Canadians voters.\n\nBut amid a push for governments around the world do to more the tackle the issue, climate change has been dominating as one of the issues that matters most to voters.\n\nMr Trudeau made meeting the Paris Accord targets a cornerstone of his campaign in 2015, and his record will be judged at the ballot box.\n\nThe decision by his Liberal government to buy the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which would carry crude oil from Alberta to British Columbia, in order to ensure a project to triple its capacity goes ahead, has also faced criticism.\n\nHouse prices have soared and wage growth has slowed\n\nDespite low unemployment and the economy showing modest growth, Canadians are feeling anxious about their economic future.\n\nThe cost of living has been identified as a priority in this campaign and all the federal parties are rolling out policies aimed at making life more affordable for Canadian families, from tax relief to making it easier for first time homebuyers to get into the housing market - especially in booming cities like Toronto and Vancouver.\n\nThe regions to watch\n\nThe results of Monday's election will be largely decided in three key, vote-rich regions - Quebec, the Greater Toronto Area, and in Lower Mainland British Columbia.\n\nSorry, your browser cannot display this map\n\nHere we look at one - the province of Quebec - where the vote has been volatile in recent years. This election is no different.\n\nGoing into the campaign's final days the Bloc Quebecois - a federal party focused on Quebec sovereignty - is in a strong second place and nipping at the Liberals' heels.\n\nQuebec voters are taking another look at a party - which only runs candidates in that province - they had relegated to the sidelines in the past two elections.\n\nThe Conservatives, who are tied with the Liberals in national polls, are trailing in third.\n\nAnd while the left-leaning NDPs have momentum in other parts of the country, they haven't gained much traction in Quebec and could lose most of the 14 seats they hold in that province.\n\nThe perils of door-knocking\n\nCanada is a vast nation, with large swaths of wilderness.\n\nThis can be a challenge for traditional door-to-door campaigning. Canada's geographically largest federal riding of Nunavut is so big, it is the size of seven United Kingdoms.\n\nIn comparison, a candidate could easily walk Canada's smallest riding - Toronto-Centre - in a matter of hours.\n\nBy Jessica Murphy, Robin Levinson-King, Tom Housden, Sumi Senthinathan and Mark Bryson.\n\nMore on Canada's election:\n\n.", "description": "Climate change, gender balance and Quebec - the issues facing Canadians this election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D56D/production/_109273645_composite_976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
