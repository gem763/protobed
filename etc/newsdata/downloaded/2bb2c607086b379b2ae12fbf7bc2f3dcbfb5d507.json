Instagram/Rihana Petra\n\nAre Kelantan\u2019s Sultan Muhammad V and former beauty queen Rihana Oksana Petra still married?\n\nAfter a copy of their alleged divorce certificate went viral on social media last month, fans across the world are unsure \u2013 but the Russian model herself has claimed media reports are fake, and continued posting regular updates of the couple\u2019s son, Ismail Leon, to legions of Instagram fans.\n\nLocal media reported that the Sultan had divorced Rihana in Singapore\u2019s Syariah Court on July 1, following suspicions that the child was not his.\n\nThe 50-year-old, who is Malaysia\u2019s former King, previously said in a video posted on Rihana\u2019s Instagram page that his top priority was having children.\n\nRead also: The lawyer of Kelantan\u2019s Sultan just confirmed his divorce, says \u2018no evidence\u2019 that baby is his son\n\nIn a post on July 27, Rihana said the \u201cdirt\u201d published by \u201cyellow media\u201d was \u201cnot legitimate\u201d, and maintained that she had not received any subpoenas, which are documents summoning an individual to court.\n\nThe former model said without elaborating that staying silent would mean conceding to \u201cuntruths\u201d and \u201cestablished stereotypes\u201d, adding that she would defend her family\u2019s honour.\n\nIt is the first time she has publicly addressed the divorce rumours. Previously, the former Miss Moscow simply continued posting pictures of herself, the baby, and the Sultan.\n\nNotably, none of her photos on social media show the family of three together.\n\n\u201cI wonder what is going on\u2026. Leon and I are at home in Russia,\u201d she said in her July 27 post, which \u2013 like many of her recent posts \u2013 was geotagged as Kulala Lumpur. \u201cMy husband is a decent Muslim and would not allow such lawlessness in my absence\u201d.\n\nIt is unclear when and for how long Rihana was in Russia with the child, and why the pair were there.\n\nIn her latest post on Aug 11, Rihana resumed posting updates of her son, describing how the baby suffered from an ear infection.\n\nIn her post, she revealed they were in Moscow when he fell ill \u2013 possibly due to cold weather \u2013 but had since recovered.\n\n\u201cLast week brought me a lot of stress and sadness,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs a first-time mother, if anything goes goes with my child, I am starting to feel an immense guilt that I have failed him.\u201d\n\nRihana also revealed that she was advised against flying with the baby for the next three to four months \u2013 meaning if the pair are still in Russia, the child will have to remain there.\n\nLast month, Rihana shared that the baby suffered from jaundice when he was born, but she mistook his yellowed skin \u2013 a classic sign of the condition \u2013 for his natural skin colour.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - It is the former model's first post after publicly addressing rumours about the royal couple's divorce..
