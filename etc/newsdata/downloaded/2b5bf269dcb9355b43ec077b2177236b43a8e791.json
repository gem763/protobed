It is always proof of failure. It is always the worst of solutions, because it brings death and misery,\u201d he said a week before the US-led coalition forces invaded Iraq. He warned that any occupation of Iraq would prove a \u201cnightmare\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jacques Chirac speaks with George W. Bush and Tony Blair, right, looks on during the G8 summit in 2005.

His vow that the \u201ccriminal folly\u201d of the German occupation was \u201cassisted by the French people, by the French state\u201d lifted the last taboo of the occupation and the collaborationist Vichy regime. His apology was the first time a postwar French head of state had fully acknowledged France\u2019s role.\n\nChirac will be remembered above all as a master in the art of political seduction. For decades he charmed the public with his endless handshaking, patting of cows\u2019 backsides and shaking of dogs\u2019 paws on his tours round France \u2013 a beer-drinking, Gitanes-smoking man of the people who was able to eat five lunches in one afternoon on the election trail.\n\nHe shook so many hands while criss-crossing France that he used to plunge his fingers into a bucket of ice at the end of the day or wear plasters to protect from the blisters he got from his powerful grip on pensioners and farmers. He had a visceral need to reach out and touch people \u2013 whether it was hugging an elderly voter or flamboyantly kissing the hand of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jacques Chirac with Angela Merkel after talks in Meseberg, February 2007. Photograph: Michael Urban/AFP/Getty Images\n\nChirac was much mocked, often satirised and once nicknamed \u201cSuperliar\u201d. After a historic trial in 2011, he became the first former president to be convicted of corruption following embezzlement charges in a party funding scandal when he was mayor of Paris. Yet he was seen to embody the French president\u2019s role as republican monarch with a kind of panache that Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande would later be found by the public to be lacking.\n\nPolitically he was known as the \u201cweathervane\u201d, for his ability to shift as it suited him. He went from championing state control in the 1970s to Ronald Reagan\u2019s free-market liberalism in the 1980s. When he was elected president in 1995, he shocked the world by resuming nuclear testing in atoll explosions in the South Pacific, then took to the stage as an eco-champion at the 2002 Earth summit, warning: \u201cOur house is burning while we look elsewhere.\u201d He went from virulent eurosceptic in the late 1970s to staunch euro-defender 10 years later.\n\nTimeline Jacques Chirac, 1932-2019 Show Hide Jacques Ren\u00e9 Chirac is born in Paris. He graduated from the Paris Institute of Political Studies and attended Harvard University's summer school, before entering the civil service and then going into politics. He starts working as head of the personal staff of prime minister Georges Pompidou, and earns the nickname \"the bulldozer\". Chirac serves his first term as prime minister of France. Chirac takes on the role of mayor of Paris, which he holds for 18 years, enabling him to build a significant personal political power-base. Chirac becomes prime minister for a second time. Chirac succeeds Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand as president of France. It marks an end to 14 years of Socialist party rule. As president, Chirac acknowledges France's role in the Holocaust: \"Yes, the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French state. France, the land of the Enlightenment and human rights ... delivered those it protects to their executioners.\" Implicated in a corruption case related to his time as mayor of Paris, Chirac is granted immunity from prosecution. Chirac wins a second term as president with 82% of the vote, as all of France's major parties swing to support him in the run-off against the Front National's far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen. Chirac's opposition to the Iraq war bolsters his popularity at home, while straining France's relationship with the US and its allies in the operation. It also leads to french fries being re-dubbed freedom fries in Congressional cafeterias. Chirac's campaign for the proposed European constitution in a referendum ends in humiliation as it is rejected by 55% of French voters. The president is forced to declare a state of emergency as rioting sweeps across France. He later announces that he will not stand for a third term as president. Chirac is succeeded as president by Nicolas Sarkozy. With his immunity expired, Chirac is found guilty of diverting public funds and abusing public confidence while he was mayor of Paris, and is given a two-year suspended prison sentence. Due to his ill health he does not attend the trial. Chirac dies \"peacefully, among his loved ones\" aged 86.\n\nDuring more than 43 years in politics, Chirac was described as a \u201cbulldozer\u201d and \u201ckiller\u201d of rivals. Born to well-off but progressive parents in Paris, what really marked him was his military service on the frontline during the Algerian war \u2013 he was the last French president to have direct experience of combat and it left him both a fan of military strategy and cautious about war.\n\nHe was a figure in French political life from the early 1960s, starting as an adviser to the prime minister George Pompidou, becoming an MP in rural Corr\u00e8ze and then a minister. Before he finally became president in 1995, he founded a political party, the Gaullist Rally for the Republic, served twice as prime minister and failed twice at a presidential election. It was his ability to take knocks and get up again that proved part of his charm.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chirac with Claude Pompidou, widow of Georges Pompidou, in September 1999.

But instead, his government\u2019s contested pension reform and planned austerity package of social security cuts prompted up to 2 million people to take to the streets, paralysing France in the worst strikes since May 1968. His term was then hamstrung by his disastrous decision to call parliamentary elections in 1997 in a bid to boost his support. The Socialists won, forcing Chirac into uncomfortable power-sharing.\n\nIn 2002, he was re-elected president with 82% of the vote after the Front National\u2019s Jean-Marie Le Pen shocked the nation by getting into the final round run-off. Chirac won because much of the leftwing electorate voting for him in order to stop the far-right leader. He later said one of his biggest regrets was not having formed a mixed national-unity government with ministers from all political sides. Instead, he stuck to his own brand of centre-right politics. In 2002 he agreed common agricultural policy payments with Germany, securing his popularity.\n\nAt home, he was most criticised for failing to steward change in France, avoiding reforms, and allowing inequalities to fester, symbolised by the 2005 urban riots on housing estates across France. The same year he called a referendum on approving the proposed EU constitution but then failed to sell the idea to the electorate, who voted no. It was a devastating blow. His popularity ratings near the end of his term were the lowest of any president since the war.\n\nAmong his success stories in office was his fight to improve road safety which was calculated to have saved 8,500 lives in four years. He ended compulsory military service and reduced the presidential term from seven years to five.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jacques Chirac and Margaret Thatcher meet in Paris, in 1975. Photograph: SIPA/REX/Shutterstock\n\nHe was a lifelong source of barbed quotes and digs, famously asking in reference to Margaret Thatcher: \u201cWhat more does the bag want, my balls on a platter?\u201d He once said of Britain: \u201cYou can\u2019t trust people who cook as badly as that.\u201d But he also made comments he would regret. \u201cAfrica is not ready for democracy,\u201d he told a group of African leaders in the early 1990s. When mayor of Paris in 1991, he made a controversial speech about immigration and talked of French people being disturbed by \u201cthe noise and the smell\u201d, sparking outrage.\n\nLike Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand before him, Chirac wanted to leave behind a great cultural project and created Paris\u2019s Quai Branly museum, a riverside monument to himself as the \u201cgreat defender\u201d of African, Asian, American and other indigenous cultures.\n\nJacques Chirac found guilty of corruption Read more\n\nThroughout his presidency, he was dogged by the sleaze scandals from his days as mayor at Paris city hall. He claimed immunity as president, but when he left office he swiftly became the first former president convicted of a crime. Aged 79, he was handed a two-year suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of embezzling public funds as Paris mayor in order to illegally finance the rightwing party he led.\n\nHis lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said at the time: \u201cWhat I hope is that this ruling doesn\u2019t change in any way the deep affection the French feel legitimately for Jacques Chirac.\u201d\n\nIt was a mark of Chirac\u2019s extraordinary life and luck that it didn\u2019t.", "description": "Head of state from 1995-2007 led opposition to the Iraq war and was first president to acknowledge France\u2019s role in the Holocaust", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis", "Agn\u00e8s Poirier"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f56d46343d7ca11fc31082febfe7bc4ec07de8f8/231_37_1551_931/master/1551.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5a7993a19b63b84c8d7050606e8151b8", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
