We\u2019re raising awareness but we\u2019re raising funds too.\n\nOne in eight women will develop breast cancer at some point in their life.

Lauder] mission.\n\n'I\u2019ve seen research we are funding in action, spoken to many leaders in the field and know how hopeful they all remain \u2013 we are making real progress towards a cure and must continue to fund that advancement!'\n\n'Help us find life-saving research': Last week, the film star took to Instagram to share a poignant message about the disease", "description": "The actress, 54, has revealed her late grandmother kept her breast cancer diagnosis a secret from her family as she raised awareness of the disease on Monday's This Morning.", "authors": ["Rianne Addo For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/12/19392436-0-image-a-46_1570446538961.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
