Originally titled Don\u2019t Stop \u2018Til You Get Enough, but changed simply to MJ last week, the show will begin previews in July 2020, before an August 13 opening night. Written by two-time Pulitzer-winning playwright Lynn Nottage (Sweat, Ruined) and directed by Tony-winning choreographer Christopher Wheeldon (An American in Paris), the jukebox musical will play the Neil Simon Theatre.\n\nSince the show was announced in June 2018, it\u2019s been hit by multiple controversies and issues. The January premiere of Leaving Neverland, a documentary featuring new child-molestation allegations against the singer, led many to decry the musical or call for its team to resign. In an April interview with the New York Times, Nottage and Wheeldon said they believe the new accusers, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, but can\u2019t definitively say if Jackson was a pedophile. Jackson\u2019s estate, involved in the musical, has denounced Robson and Safechuck as \u201cliars.\u201d Then in February, the show canceled a planned fall pre-Broadway run in Chicago, citing scheduling issues around an Actors\u2019 Equity strike. In its own statement, the union responded, \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly disappointing that the actors and stage managers who are currently working to develop this project were not informed about a major production change before a public media announcement was made.\u201d\n\nStill want tickets?
