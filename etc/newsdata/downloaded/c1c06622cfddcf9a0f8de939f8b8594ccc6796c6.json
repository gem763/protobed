That firsthand witness is Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman.\n\nVindman emigrated from the former Soviet Union at the age of three and is a combat-wounded Iraq veteran who speaks Ukrainian and Russian fluently. When word leaked that he would largely confirm testimony from other witnesses, some of Trump's TV allies tried to smear the Purple Heart recipient as somehow disloyal to the United States.\n\nOne Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Florida congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, told me she found the attacks on Vindman \"revolting,\" and said they reveal the weakness of the Republicans' case: \u201dThey've got nothing, so they either have to focus on process or try to undermine the credibility of someone who's defended the United States of America and kept us safe.\"\n\nCalifornia Democrat Rep. Ted Lieu, an Air Force Reserve Colonel, similarly called the attacks \"disgraceful.\"\n\n\"[Vindman] risked his life, he spilled his blood\u2026 people who attack his loyalty should apologize,\" he said. \"It makes me sad for America that they're willing to attack a patriotic American soldier simply because he's about to tell the truth.\"\n\nRepublicans may have gotten the message that smearing a combat veteran isn't going to fly in middle America. At their weekly leadership press conference, House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Liz Cheney pushed back against Trump allies' attacks on Vindman.\n\n\"It is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this country,\" Cheney said of attacks on witnesses like Vindman and Ambassador William Taylor, a Vietnam veteran and career foreign service officer.\n\nInstead, Republicans are trying another tack. They're now arguing that the lack of a vote that wasn't legally necessary to begin with has tainted all the evidence gathered by the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees over the past four and a half weeks.\n\n\"A due process starts at the beginning. It doesn't affirm a miss, sham investigation all the way through,\" House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday. \"If you were in the legal term, it'd be the fruit from the poisonous tree.\"\n\nMcCarthy also added a new twist to the \"no quid pro quo\" line which he and his fellow Trump defenders have been chanting like a mantra lately. No longer do he and compatriots argue that there was no quid pro quo because Trump never held up military aid. Instead, McCarthy now argues that there was no quid pro quo because the White House eventually released the military aid after inquiries from Senate Republicans.\n\n\"We all have the transcript. We are all able to see there was no quid pro quo \u2014 the money was released, Ukraine did nothing and no action was taken,\" he said. \"Where's the crime? Where's the impeachable offense?\"\n\n\"If you ask scholars, nothing in that phone call is impeachable,\" he added.\n\nI decided to take McCarthy up on his challenge by asking some scholars about his latest attempts to find a defense for President Trump.\n\nThe scholars were not impressed.\n\nWhen I asked University of Missouri law professor Frank Bowman about McCarthy's \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" argument, he immediately began laughing.\n\nHe continued laughing for at least 10 seconds, then calmed himself long enough to ask if I wanted a more...scholarly answer.\n\n\"It's just comical,\" said Bowman, who is the author of High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump. \"Their demand was for a resolution, and now the resolution isn't good enough.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what the Democrats do or don't do, certain members of the House Republicans are going to complain\u2026 they're not talking about substance at all. The evasion is so transparent as to be pretty comical.\"", "description": "As the impeachment inquiry rumbles on, Trump's defenders in the House Republican caucus have decided to try out a few new defenses.", "authors": ["Andrew Feinberg"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OdGtR0_mj1RN3wOWAzs5ew--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/156286e9f79e670cd2f46409a358992d", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
