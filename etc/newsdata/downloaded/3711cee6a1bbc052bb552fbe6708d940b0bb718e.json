One driver was allowed to continue operating on the platform after a truly horrifying incident: He and several other men allegedly took a passenger intended for Crown Heights to a park in New Jersey, where they violently assaulted her. Another driver was permitted by Lyft to continue giving over 700 rides after severely beating one of his passengers, stomping his head into the ground.\n\nLyft users are alleging a robotic and inefficient complaint system shows Uber\u2019s biggest rival cares more about profits than the safety of its clients.\n\nThen, there\u2019s Lyft rival Uber, which has been posting major losses after the biggest IPO of 2019.\n\nNow. the question is: are rideshares unsafe and unfit for our current world? On today\u2019s episode of CYBER, new Motherboard reporter Lauren Kaori Gurley tells us all about how Lyft and Uber have a lot to answer for.\n\nFollow Ben and Lauren on Twitter.", "description": "Rideshares were once the darlings of Wall Street, but now they\u2019re being exposed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9765c8d6b4db000a1eaf29/lede/1570203214538-cyber-podcast-art.png?crop=1xw:0.562xh;0xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
