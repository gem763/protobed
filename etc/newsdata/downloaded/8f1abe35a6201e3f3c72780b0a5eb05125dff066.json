He will then serve four years on licence upon his release.", "description": "Michael Enzanga, 20, from north London, knifed Hampshire Police officer Russell Turner as he tried to apprehend him", "authors": ["Tom Davidson"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20544494.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_NHP_CHP_091019Michael-Enzanga_068JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
