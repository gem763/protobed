Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is holding steadfast in her belief that her version of \u201cMedicare for All\u201d is indeed \u201cthe best,\u201d as she said during an August forum.\n\nBut, the presidential hopeful\u2019s unwavering defense of her self-drafted health care plan didn\u2019t deter progressive activist, lawyer and author Ady Barkan from pointing out what he found to be glaring flaws in her proposal.\n\nIn a nine-minute video capturing his discussion (below) with Harris released on Monday, Barkan, who was diagnosed with ALS in 2016, took Harris to task when he asked her why she was using the phrase \u201cMedicare for All\u201d to describe her plan, when to him, it sounded more like something \u201ccloser to a combination of private and public options rather than a single-payer \u2018Medicare For All.\u2019\u201d\n\nUnlike Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-Vt.) single-payer bill that Harris had previously supported, the California senator\u2019s proposal would give Americans the option of keeping their private health insurance plans. Harris\u2019 plan also includes a 10-year transitory period to phase out privatized insurance, which critics say is too long.\n\nIn response, Harris explained that with her plan, \u201ceverybody will be covered \u2026 and it will be a Medicare system\u201d in which private insurers \u201chave to be in our system \u2026 and it will be by our rules.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Barkan decided to share why he thinks Sanders\u2019 single-payer bill \u2014 which senators and presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York also support \u2014 is the best approach for reforming the country\u2019s health care system.\n\nDrew Angerer via Getty Images Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Kamala Harris take part in the second night of the first Democratic presidential debate in June in Miami, Florida.\n\nUnder Harris\u2019 plan, Barkan said, \u201cmillions of people like me will still be denied care by their for-profit insurance company\u201d during the 10-year transition period and possibly afterwards. Because of this, Barkan said he believes that people \u201cwill avoid getting needed care because of high co-pays and deductibles.\u201d\n\nIn his opinion, Sanders\u2019 single-payer plan would drive down \u201cbillions of dollars per year in administrative and billing costs,\u201d which are a result of the for-profit system.\n\n\u201cThat will not happen if providers still have to bill numerous insurance companies,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cFinally, there is the political reality,\u201d Barkan concluded. \u201cThe insurance industry is going to do everything it can to block any of these proposals, including yours, which means the only way to win is with a huge grassroots movement, and from what I can see, that enthusiasm only exists for \u2018Medicare for All.\u2019 So, where am I wrong?\u201d\n\nIn response, Harris said that with her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan, on Day 1, \u201cyou can get into the system of \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 and have a public plan, you don\u2019t have to do a private plan. It\u2019s your choice.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 answer echoed what she has said in the past of her plan, but many people on Twitter still seemed to enjoy watching Barkan make compelling arguments about what he considered to be holes in her bill.\n\nYOWZA ADY ISN\u2019T MESSING AROUND pic.twitter.com/axUNAb9aPS \u2014 rob delaney (@robdelaney) September 11, 2019\n\nTold her to her face \ud83d\ude33 pic.twitter.com/wNGPaiyKrp \u2014 The Stunt Queen Agency (@StuntQueenAgncy) September 11, 2019\n\nNotice the part where she nervously grabbed that water glass? \ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Penny Lane (@mizpennylane20) September 11, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s one of the biggest badasses out there \u2014 Scott (@tishkabibble) September 11, 2019\n\nBarkan also questioned Harris\u2019 10-year transition period, which he pointed out would span \u201cthe course of at least two different presidencies\u201d and would give Republicans \u201cmany opportunities to block it.\u201d\n\nTo see her response, check out the video above.", "description": "Ady Barkan believes that \u201cmillions of people like me will still be denied care by their for-profit insurance company\u201d under Harris\u2019 plan.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d796f682300005805515aed.png?cache=ez2cz4dkhv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
