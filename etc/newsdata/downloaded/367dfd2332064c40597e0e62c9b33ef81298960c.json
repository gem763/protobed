It filed for bankruptcy protection in August, citing rent hikes as a factor in its decision.\n\nAuthentic Brands\u2019 offer for Barneys calls for a handful of its storied brick-and-mortar outposts to remain open, potentially including its flagship Madison Avenue store in Manhattan and its Beverly Hills, California, location, the sources said.\n\nWhether the existing retail locations remain open will depend on negotiations with landlords, they said. Barneys currently has seven physical retail locations remaining.\n\nAs part of the Authentic Brands deal, it will license the Barneys name to Hudson\u2019s Bay Co, the owner of luxury department store chain Saks Fifth Avenue, the sources said. The agreement would also allow Hudson\u2019s Bay to operate the Barneys website, one of the sources said.\n\nThe expected deal with Authentic Brands sets a floor for bids in a bankruptcy-court auction scheduled for later this month, should any arise. A group led by fashion executive Sam Ben-Avraham has explored a bid for Barneys and is continuing to work an a potential deal that envisions keeping many of the retailer\u2019s current stores open, one of the sources said.\n\nBen-Avraham did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the strong buyer interest and recognition of the value in the Barneys assets and brand name,\u201d Barneys Chief Executive Officer Daniella Vitale said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work diligently on the sale process with the goal of maximizing value and ensuring a long and successful future for the benefit of our employees, customers, vendors and other business partners.\u201d\n\nAuthentic Brands did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Hudson\u2019s Bay declined to comment. The sources spoke on the condition they not be identified because the discussions are confidential.\n\nAuthentic Brands is a prolific acquirer of labels, including Nine West.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on the value of Authentic Brands\u2019 bid for Barneys and its partnership with Hudson\u2019s Bay earlier on Monday.\n\nBarneys is one of the most high-profile victims of the downturn in retail, and underscores how even luxury department stores are not immune from fierce competition with e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com Inc.\n\nSears Holdings Corp, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc and Gymboree Group Inc have also filed for bankruptcy in the last two years.\n\nIn addition to its upscale department stores and Freds restaurants, Barneys operates Barneys Warehouse outlets. The nearly 100-year-old retailer\u2019s most prominent locations include Beverly Hills, California; Chicago; Seattle; Boston; San Francisco; and Las Vegas.\n\nBarneys made its name in the 1930s by placing women dressed in barrels outside beer halls in New York City, where they would hand out matchbooks advertising the store, according to the retailer\u2019s website.\n\nThe store, now known for exclusive apparel made by designers such as Burberry Group Plc, began as a destination for middle-class families. It transitioned to luxury fashion in the 1960s.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "Without a deal, Barneys faces winding down its business entirely", "authors": ["Jessica Dinapoli", "Mike Spector"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/barneys.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
