Issuers are moving beyond suburban staples to include millennial-friendly categories such as transit and streaming subscriptions.\n\nThe trend toward streaming rewards, in particular, is hard to miss, with cards from American Express, AXP, -0.22% Chase JPM, +2.48% and Wells Fargo WFC, +2.67% now featuring streaming as a bonus category. But what\u2019s behind this explosion?\n\nFor starters, streaming is wildly popular. As of 2017, more than half of U.S. households subscribed to paid video-streaming services, according to Deloitte\u2019s digital media trends survey. But experts say it\u2019s also about issuers forging early connections with younger consumers and ensuring that they remain customers.\n\n\u201cThe strategy is simple: If a consumer opens a credit card when young, the [issuer] can build a long-term relationship with the consumer,\u201d says Logan Allec, a CPA and founder of the financial blog Money Done Right.\n\nMeeting people where they\u2019re spending\n\nThe Deloitte study notes the percentage of U.S. households subscribing to a paid streaming video service grew from 10% in 2009 to 55% in 2017 \u2014 a 450% increase. Consumers subscribe to an average of three such services.\n\nIssuers have taken notice. Wells Fargo made a splash last summer, revamping the Wells Fargo Propel American Express card, which now earns triple points back per dollar spent on eligible streaming services. Terms apply. In May 2019, the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express underwent a makeover, adding select U.S. streaming services as a 6% cash-back category. Terms apply.\n\nRelated: 5 tips to increase your credit card rewards\n\nThe following month, the Chase Freedom card entered the streaming fray. The card earns 5% cash back in bonus categories that rotate each quarter, on up to $1,500 in spending per quarter. (You must opt in to the bonus categories each quarter; all other purchases earn 1% back.) From July 1 to Sept. 30, 2019, one of those bonus categories is select streaming services.\n\nKunal Madhok, vice president of U.S. consumer lending and acquisition at American Express, noted via email that AmEx research found that a segment of millennials were spending more on \u201cday-to-day\u201d costs like commuting and streaming compared with five years ago. So the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express was reworked to reward cardholders more heavily for these types of costs.\n\n\u201cThe card is designed to give people the most cash back on the things they value and spend frequently on, now including quality time at home streaming their favorite show,\u201d Madhok said.\n\nOf course, your monthly Netflix NFLX, +1.44% bill likely represents only a fraction of your household budget, so don\u2019t expect a boatload of rewards from this category alone. Say your family spends $15.99 a month on Netflix Premium, $14.99 a month on a Spotify SPOT, -1.44% Family plan and $5.99 a month on Hulu, for a total of $443.64 a year. If you earn 6% cash back on these services by paying for them with the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express, that\u2019s just $26.62 in rewards a year.

When choosing any rewards card, look for categories that match your spending enough to offset that cost.\n\nBuilding relationships with younger spenders\n\nPer the Deloitte survey, 70% of Gen Z households (ages 14 to 20) had a streaming subscription in 2017, as did 68% of millennial households (ages 21 to 34).\n\nExperts say credit card issuers see an opportunity here to lure customers while they\u2019re young, rewarding them for the spending they\u2019re doing anyway while also converting them into long-term cardholders.\n\n\u201cAs the consumer gets older, and presumably begins to spend more, the credit card company has already secured their business,\u201d Allec says.\n\nAlso see: \u2018Disney will win\u2019 streaming battle with Netflix: analyst\n\nSubscription services can give these relationships staying power, too, because they\u2019re typically \u201cset it and forget it\u201d transactions. If an issuer can get you to use its card as your automated payment method each month, you\u2019re more likely to keep it \u2014 even if you never take the card out of your wallet.\n\n\u201cCredit card companies want consumers to choose their cards for subscriptions as it\u2019s a regular \u2014 often monthly \u2014 recurring transaction that they can rely on as a base of card spend,\u201d says Derek Szeto, co-founder of Butter, a tool that helps consumers track and manage subscriptions.\n\n\u201cActive cards are sticky cards.\u201d\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "More credit cards are offering cash back and points for things like Hulu, Netflix and Spotify.", "authors": ["Sara Rathner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ403_nerd_s_ZG_20190829114611.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
