Tonight's going to be everything,\" he said, explaining that wind gusts will make things much more intense this evening.\n\n\"It's not done yet, that is the message.\"\n\nWaves crashing towards the front door of my office on Chevrier Blvd. City bus as well as multiple cars stalled. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/mbstorm?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#mbstorm</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/9GgQQjqMdW\">pic.twitter.com/9GgQQjqMdW</a> \u2014@jadeaflora South Winnipeg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wpgstorm?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#wpgstorm</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Wpgpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Wpgpoli</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mbpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Mbpoli</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/XBCFlAiGXB\">pic.twitter.com/XBCFlAiGXB</a> \u2014@JaniceLukes\n\n\"What we experienced this morning was a squall line. What we are expecting later is a frontal passage, which will bring, yet again, severe storms, torrential downpours, strong straight-line winds and intense hail,\" said Natalie Hasell, warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment Canada.\n\nThere's even the potential for a tornado to develop, she said.\n\n\"The question is 'Where?' \" Hasell said. \"But right now, we're looking at somewhere closer to the [U.S.] border.\"\n\nEnvironment Canada is updating its weather alerts page for the province as the fast-moving storms rumble through.\n\nStreets are flooded near Route 90 on Friday morning. (Submitted)\n\nThe storms rolled into Winnipeg around 8:30 a.m., first darkening the sky then animating it with bursts of lightning.\n\nAt least one house fire in the city was blamed on a lightning strike. Emergency crews were called to a two-storey home in the Bridgwater Lakes neighbourhood just before 10 a.m.\n\nThe fire was quickly brought under control by 10:30 a.m. but the home suffered significant damage to the roof and attic, according to the city's Fire Paramedic Service.\n\nThe city of Winnipeg's 311 service received over 250 calls in just over an hour in response to the storm.\n\nAs of 1:30 p.m. Friday the city received the following reports:\n\nPlugged Catch Basin \u2013 Front Street: 191\n\nPlugged Catch Basin \u2013 Back Lane: 28\n\nManhole Cover Off or Ajar: 10\n\nSewer Back-up \u2013 Clean Water: 8\n\nSewer Back-up \u2013 Raw Sewage: 5\n\nDamaged trees: 13\n\nManitoba Hydro also reported hundreds of customers were briefly without of power east of Carman, Man., after lightning struck a power line. Meanwhile, about 930 customers are without power in Winnipeg after the storm knocked down lines in Wolseley.\n\nThere are reports of several trees down in the city and many flooded, impassable streets as the city was hit with 40-60 millimetres of rain in two hours.\n\n\"And we could see another 50-60 mm of rain with this next round of storms that move through this evening,\" Sauder said.\n\nThe City of Winnipeg's traffic management centre noted several flooded roads littered with stalled vehicles through the morning, particularly along south Pembina Highway, near Killarney Avenue.\n\nDrivers were being urged to avoid the area.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit of that storm that rolled through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bdnmb?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#bdnmb</a> earlier.

No amounts are available yet in the southeast, where the storms were still happening as of noon.\n\nThe storms also caused flight delays at the Winnipeg airport. A lightning advisory prevented ground crews from unloading or refuelling planes, which meant they couldn't take off.\n\nThe Winnipeg Airports Authority suggests checking the website for updates.\n\nWhile the storms systems should finally clear out of the province by early Saturday morning, clouds and showers are expected throughout the weekend.\n\nWinnipeg is possibly in line for another 20-25 mm on top of whatever comes tonight, Sauder said. That could mean close to 95 mm in addition to what fell Friday morning.\n\nMelita, in the province's southwest corner, could see another 107 mm, he said.", "description": "A day of unsettled and severe weather is pounding\u00a0southern Manitoba and flooding streets in Winnipeg.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5291290.1568993298!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/flooded-roads-in-winnipeg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
