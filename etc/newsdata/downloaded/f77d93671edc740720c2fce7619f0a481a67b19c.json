The woman, who was gone between June 21 and Sept. 9, returned earlier this month to find a ring, a necklace and a pair of diamond and emerald earrings were missing, among other expensive jewels.\n\nThe other theft involved a $117,000 diamond bracelet taken from Isabelle Bscher, a 33-year-old art dealer who lives on the 59th floor. Basher said the theft took place while she was on a weeklong vacation between Sept. 4 and Sept. 9.\n\nPolice have not yet identified a suspect but are investigating everyone with access to the building, as there seemed to be no sign of forced entry in either case, according to the New York Times.\n\n\"It's not somebody breaking into the building or roaming the halls, trying the doors until they find one that's open,\" one anonymous source told the New York Post.\n\nNews of the thefts comes as Trump is visiting New York for this week's United Nations General Assembly, where nearly 200 world leaders will spend the next several days giving speeches and discussing global issues. CNN reported that the president did stay at Trump Tower Sunday night.", "description": "More than $350,000 in diamonds, emeralds and sapphires has been stolen from apartments inside Trump Tower, according to police.", "authors": ["Dillon Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/olymwo0ov5E7Xs1qrTAv4A--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/2552x1673+0+119/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/377cd710-de27-11e9-b6ef-34e451e8d4a8", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
