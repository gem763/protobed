(Photo: Courtesy of AbbVie)\n\nWhen a long, black bus bearing the logo of drugmaker AbbVie rolls through Washington state next year, it will promote a new effort to eradicate hepatitis C infections.\n\nThe state is paying for the marketing campaign as part of a deal to give AbbVie the exclusive right to treat its citizens who have the potentially deadly liver disease. Armed with its medication, Mavyret, AbbVie beat out rivals Merck and Gilead Sciences in a blind bidding process.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time this year that a state has struck a novel deal with a pharmaceutical company to obtain drugs that can cure hepatitis C \u2013 with discounts from a price that came to market at $84,000 for a course of treatment.\n\nThe drugmakers are in a race to treat the 2.4 million people in the U.S. with the viral infection. Left untreated, its most chronic form can cause liver damage, including cirrhosis, as well as liver cancer and death. States are weighing the price of curing those infected with hep C using the new drugs against the medical and economic costs of long-term care for those with untreated infections. The state bears the medical expenses of the Medicaid and prison populations as well as public employees and retirees.\n\nThe money paid to AbbVie buys a package of services that includes outreach and testing to identify patients as well as the drugs to treat them. But the price and other details of the deal are secret under the Washington state Public Records Act, even though they involve massive commitment of taxpayer dollars.\n\nWashington officials said they\u2019re prohibited from releasing details by federal rules that hide drug pricing to protect what companies consider trade secrets. Lawyers for the three pharmaceutical firms that submitted bids vowed to go to court to halt the release of bid documents requested by Kaiser Health News under state public records laws.\n\nWithout transparency about the details, however, it is impossible to evaluate whether the spending amounts to smart public policy or a boondoggle that primarily benefits manufacturers hoping to lock down payments of perhaps $10,000 per patient for drugs from Medicaid. The same drugs from the same manufacturers can cost less than $100 per course of treatment in other parts of the world.\n\nInvestigation: Massive marketing muscle pushes 3D mammograms, despite no evidence they save more lives\n\nBroad terms, vague details: Health officials want more transparency\n\nThe secrecy troubles Dr. John Scott, medical director of the University of Washington\u2019s Hepatitis and Liver Clinic at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, which treats most of the 65,000 hepatitis C patients in the state \u2013 even as he welcomes the curative drugs and wider access to treatment.\n\n\u201cI absolutely support greater transparency,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think the public needs to know how much these things cost.\u201d\n\nMany people don\u2019t realize that such obscurity is \u201cbaked into the system,\u201d said Pam Curtis, director of the Center for Evidence-Based Policy at Oregon Health & Science University.\n\n\u201cThat definitely hamstrings our ability to weigh the facts in front of us,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want policy to be driven by the highest-quality evidence.\u201d\n\nOther states are eyeing the experiments \u201cwith a healthy skepticism but a high level of interest,\u201d said Jennifer Reck, project director for the National Academy for State Health Policy.\n\nA smoking alternative? FDA endorses tobacco pouches as less risky than cigarettes\n\nIn Washington, officials would describe the terms of the AbbVie contract only in the broadest terms. After federal rebates, the state spent about $80.4 million in 2018 on the drugs, known as direct-acting antivirals, to treat more than 3,300 patients, figures show.\n\nUnder the new contract, officials expect to spend about the same amount of money per year, while treating twice as many patients, said Dr. Judy Zerzan, chief medical officer for the Washington State Health Care Authority.\n\nThat works out to more than $321 million to treat about 30,000 patients over four years, with options for two-year extensions.\n\nBut that would be an improvement over the nearly $387 million state officials have spent since 2014 to treat just 10,377 people, according to state records. That works out to an average cost of $37,259 apiece, though actual fees vary by program.\n\nWashington\u2019s request for proposals included a provision that other states could join its program in the future \u2013 also a potential benefit to AbbVie.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably an alignment of interests all the way around here,\u201d said Alan Carr, a senior analyst focusing on biotechnology with the Wall Street firm Needham & Co.\n\nA depleting market for hepatitis C drugs\n\nAnother reason it\u2019s a race for the drugmakers: The overall market for hepatitis C drugs has been \u201cfalling fast,\u201d as more patients are treated and cured, Carr said.\n\n\u201cThe companies are trying to find a way to ensure the remaining patients use their drug,\u201d Carr said. \u201c(They) have a lot less leverage than they once had, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re willing to do these deals.\u201d\n\nMany patients with hepatitis C have no symptoms and are silent carriers. Only a fraction of people with the virus will develop the serious consequence of the disease, liver failure or cancer. Still, most public health experts urge screening \u2013 and treatment.\n\nThe new contracts \u2013 sometimes referred to as \u201cthe Netflix model\u201d because they mimic that media-streaming service \u2013 call for capped costs or flat-rate subscriptions for cheap access to the drugs.\n\nBut the plan is much broader than creating a drug discount for the state, said Michael Staff, AbbVie\u2019s vice president of U.S. market access.\n\n\u201cSimply stating you want to eradicate hepatitis C without a very detailed plan is probably not going to be effective,\u201d he said. AbbVie\u2019s contract includes payments for services that include outreach, such as the bus, to identify infected patients.\n\nIn Washington, the arrangement would treat about half of those in the state infected with hepatitis C, but the average per-patient cost would be about 40% less than before the deal, Zerzan said.\n\nChasing down the source: Illegal vapes can be traced to this California woman, one of the pioneers of CBD\n\nIn Louisiana, the first state to announce a flat-rate hepatitis C drug agreement, Asegua, a subsidiary of Gilead, will provide an unlimited amount of its drug, Epclusa, for a set price \u2013 roughly $58 million a year for five years, or up to $290 million. Louisiana plans to treat about 31,000 of 39,000 Medicaid patients and prisoners believed to have the disease. Costs could drop to less than $10,000 per patient, according to the contract, which the state health agency made available after a public records request.\n\nThe flat-rate concept was put forward by Dr. Peter Bach, director of Memorial Sloan Kettering\u2019s Center for Health Policy and Outcomes, and his colleagues. Australia implemented a similar arrangement in its national health plan. England\u2019s National Health Service has one as well.\n\nA public health dilemma\n\nIn Egypt, which has the highest hepatitis C rate in the world, negotiations and generic pricing have reduced costs to $84 for a course of treatment.\n\nU.S. drugmakers likely wouldn\u2019t have considered such a plan when they first introduced their medications. Gilead\u2019s Sovaldi, the first antiviral for hepatitis C, launched at $84,000 for a course of treatment; the second, Harvoni, started at $94,500. Three years later, AbbVie introduced Mavyret at $26,400.\n\nNow, Bach said, drugmakers are staring down a sharp decline of their once-hot market.\n\n\u201cThey were losing market share and price per share,\u201d Bach said. \u201cIf payers (like state Medicaid programs) can give them the same revenue with much more certainty, they\u2019ll prefer that to uncertainty over what\u2019s happening now.\u201d\n\nHepatitis C poses dilemmas for public health officials and drugmakers alike.\n\nLouisiana has been under pressure from the American Civil Liberties Union regarding prisoners who said they were denied effective hepatitis C treatment. And Washington state\u2019s Department of Corrections faces at least one lawsuit from a prisoner who said he was denied timely care for his disease.\n\nShe was expelled for using prescribed medical marijuana: Now she's suing the college\n\nIn Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee directed health officials last year to negotiate the best deal to eliminate hepatitis C in the state by 2030, which mirrors goals of global health agencies.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned last month that new hepatitis C infections are on the rise \u2013 44,300 in 2017, the seventh consecutive annual increase. New cases of hepatitis C have spiked among adults in their 20s and 30s, largely because of the opioid epidemic, according to the CDC.\n\nBetween 15% and 25% of people with acute hepatitis C will clear the infection on their own; the rest become chronically infected with the virus.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have been treated \u2013 and cured \u2013 since the drugs were introduced early this decade. Deaths from hepatitis C fell from almost 20,000 in 2014 to a little more than 17,000 in 2017, which could be an effect of the new drugs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been transformational,\u201d said Scott, of the University of Washington\u2019s Hepatitis and Liver Clinic. Previous treatments for hepatitis C had to be taken for a year, had toxic side effects and helped only 40% of patients, he added.\n\nThe Center for Evidence-Based Policy has advised Washington state in the effort to eradicate hep C, Curtis said. She noted that the arrangements Washington and Louisiana struck share an overall goal of reining in runaway drug prices, especially in state-run Medicaid programs, which can\u2019t shift costs like the commercial market and would be forced instead to cut services.\n\n\u201cStates are already struggling,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cA larger and larger part of their budget is being eaten up by these new high-cost drugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a solution,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.
