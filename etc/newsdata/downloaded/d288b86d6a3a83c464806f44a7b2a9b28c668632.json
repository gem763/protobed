The October 4 post sparked a furor that\u2019s prompted Beijing to yank the NBA off the air in retaliation, and drew Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James into the fray.\n\n\u201cThe losses have already been substantial,\u201d Silver said, speaking at the TIME 100 Health Summit. \u201cOur games are not back on the air in China, as we speak, and we\u2019ll see what happens next.\u201d\n\nSilver said he has been traveling to China for the past 15 years, and felt the league had made significant inroads in the country that could now be undermined by the controversy.\n\n\u201cI felt we had made enormous progress in building cultural exchanges with the Chinese people and I have to regret that much of that is lost. I\u2019m not even sure where we\u2019ll go from here, but..the financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic,\u201d he added.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver speaks about mental health and China controversy at TIME 100 Health Summit on October 17, 2019 in New York City. More\n\nSilver said the league has been on air with CCTV in China for more than 30 years, and more than 600 million people watched last season.\n\nThe NBA and its players have come under widespread criticism to their response to the original tweet by Morey, who has since apologized.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable,\u201d NBA chief communications officer Mike Bass said in the wake of the controversy.\n\n\n\n\n\n1/ I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nThe league\u2019s initial response using the word \u201cregrettable\u201d sparked further controversy about the NBA\u2019s stance on free speech, but Silver said the statement was targeting the Chinese fans who were upset by the original tweet.\n\nSilver said the league stood up for Morey\u2019s right to free speech by making it clear to the Chinese government that he would not be penalized.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s top official said he felt that Chinese fans understood there was a difference in a platform for expression and government platforms.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see it as my role as commissioner of the NBA to weigh in on the substance on the protest,\u201d Silver said.\n\nCiting an open letter written by Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai, Silver said he found that perspective \u201cperfectly appropriate.\u201d\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
