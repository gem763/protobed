It has a price target of $60 by the end of 2021.\n\nWhile calling the company\u2019s underperformance in the last decade \"severe and disappointing,\u201d the hedge fund added that by undertaking structural reform, the company has a shot at real growth.\n\nElliott\u2019s \"Activating AT&T Plan\" includes the company \"divesting non-core assets; reducing operational inefficiency; instituting capital discipline,\u201d as well as shedding debt and bolstering its leadership and oversight, according to the letter.\n\n\u201cElliott believes that through readily achievable initiatives [like] increased strategic focus, improved operational efficiency, a formal capital allocation framework, and enhanced leadership and oversight\u201d the stock could effectively double in two years.\n\nThat move represents \u201ca rare opportunity for any company, let alone one of the world\u2019s largest,\u201d it added.\n\nShares of AT&T jumped more than 3% in early trading, last changing hands near $37 from Friday\u2019s close.\n\n\u2018Distractions\u2019, and an underperforming stock\n\nIn the letter, Elliott outlined how AT&T has underperformed over the last decade, specifically pointing to its dealmaking strategy as the main culprit.\n\nSome of the \"questionable\u201d mergers and acquisitions (M&A) Elliott highlighted include blockbuster purchases of Time Warner in 2016 and DirecTV in 2014, and the attempt to buy T-Mobile. The latter was something Elliott called \"the most damaging deal was the one not done.\u201d\n\nElliott called AT&T an \"outlier\" when it comes to its M&A strategy, noting that the company has sought to assemble conglomerates.\n\n\"We firmly believe that AT&T\u2019s M&A strategy has not only contributed directly to its profound share price underperformance, but has also caused distractions that have contributed to the Company\u2019s recent operational underperformance,\" the letter said.\n\nThe firm listed a litany of other gripes against AT&T\u2019s management that contributed to low shareholder value, and a \u201cprolonged and substantial underperformance of AT&T as an investment relative to its potential,\" Elliott wrote.\n\n\"Over the past ten years, for example, AT&T \u2013 a 'bellwether' in all senses of the word \u2013 has not only failed to keep pace with the broader market, but has actually underperformed by over 150 percentage points,\u201d Elliott added.\n\nThat said, the hedge fund believes the stock is \u201chistorically cheap,\u201d and the core telecommunications businesses are performing well and positioned to do so going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.
