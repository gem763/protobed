USA TODAY\n\nA quick rundown on items of interest as Week 7 rolls on in the NFL:\n\nWho\u2019s hot: Russell Wilson. Maybe this will be the year that the Seahawks star quarterback finally gets at least one vote for MVP. Better yet, perhaps Wilson will get most of the votes. Through six games, Wilson has emerged as the front-runner in the MVP race \u2013 Westgate Las Vegas installed him this week as a 2/1 favorite \u2013 while also proving that he can still get better. He heads into the game against Baltimore on Sunday leading the NFL with a sizzling 124.7 passer rating, yet to throw a pick this season while tossing 14 TDs. Consistency is the ticket.\n\nHe\u2019s had a rating of 100 or better in each game, to go with his typical Houdini escape acts to create plays and the unflappable demeanor demonstrated during the big comeback at Cleveland on Sunday. And surely, there\u2019s no buyer\u2019s remorse in Seattle after Wilson, 30, signed a 4-year, $140 million extension last spring that made him the NFL\u2019s highest-paid player with $35 million per year in new money. Shoot, the way he\u2019s sparked the Seahawks to a 5-1 start, Wilson also makes the case that he\u2019s underpaid.\n\nSeattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson celebrates after throwing a touchdown pass against the Los Angeles Rams.

Go back to last November, when Dallas sank to 3-5 after an uninspiring home loss to the Titans. Then the Cowboys beat Philadelphia to ignite a five-game winning streak that led to the NFC East crown. The moral of that for rabid Cowboys Nation: They rebounded from situations that look worse than the current three-game losing streak. And here comes Philly for a prime-time showdown. Sure, Garrett\u2019s in the final year of his contract. But if Jerry Jones didn\u2019t dump him last November, he certainly won\u2019t pull the plug now. But check back in December or January if this thing totally collapses.\n\nMore: Cowboys DE DeMarcus Lawrence tells Eagles coach Doug Pederson to 'shut his (expletive) up'\n\nKey matchup: Lions vs. Zebras. Matt Patricia knows. He\u2019s no longer in New England. The second-year Detroit coach heads into another NFC North showdown against the Vikings feeling the full effects of the \u201cBobby Layne Curse\u201d after multiple bogus calls cost the Leos a possible victory at Green Bay.\n\nAdd the phantom hands-to-the-face penalties against Trey Flowers on Monday night to the litany of other \u201cC\u2019mon, man\u201d moments from close losses over the years: the batted ball fiasco in Seattle (2015); the DPI flag picked up in crunch time of a playoff game at Dallas (2015) despite a flagrant mugging of Brandon Pettigrew by Anthony Hitchens; the Megatron touchdown catch reversed in Chicago (2010). Why are the Lions so often victimized by horrendous officiating? This begs for an investigation \u2026 or the Ghostbusters.\n\nNext man up: Ryan Tannehill. It was Marcus Mariota\u2019s job to lose, as suggestions that Mike Vrabel would make a QB switch have been there since the exhibition season. Maybe the spark is coming. Tannehill, an eighth-year pro, was never threatened as the starter during his healthy years as the Dolphins\u2019 franchise quarterback. Now he one-ups Mariota, who seems destined to challenge another quarterback elsewhere. It\u2019s striking that the QBs taken 1-2 in 2015, Jameis Winston and Mariota, have both underwhelmed in what seemingly shape up as prove-it-or-move-it seasons. Tannehill can relate, but now he\u2019s positioned for a second chance to blossom.\n\nRookie watch: Kyler Murray. The Cardinals\u2019 emerging star has passed for 593 yards with zero picks in back-to-back victories, reflecting another layer of growth during his transition as the No. 1 pick overall. He\u2019s protected the football well. And he\u2019s still a dual threat, as advertised, running for 93 yards in Week 5 against the Bengals, then throwing for 340 last weekend against the Falcons.\n\nWeek 7 picks: Do Cowboys or Eagles claim first place in NFC East?\n\nMore: Brett Favre, Randy Moss and Ray Lewis land on list of NFL's greatest players. Here are Nos. 21-100\n\nSunday\u2019s matchup against the Giants presents a neat subplot as Murray will be opposite the second quarterback drafted, Daniel Jones, picked 6th overall. Jones (5 TDs, 6 INTs) has had more uneven performances since replacing Eli Manning in Week 3. But he\u2019s also had a few moments. Maybe this will be the first in yet another \u201cNFL future\u201d QB rivalry.\n\nStomach for an upset:Saints at Bears. Suggestions that Chase Daniel might be better for Chicago than injured starting quarterback Mitchell Trubisky kind of dissipated after the backup threw two ugly interceptions in the upset loss to the Raiders in London. The buzz in the Windy City this week is whether the starter can make it back from his shoulder injury. Bears coach Matt Nagy says it\u2019s possible \u2026 perhaps as a bit of gamesmanship.\n\nOne thing's for sure: Drew Brees won\u2019t be back this week, leaving Teddy Bridgewater at the helm again. Brees\u2019 backup hasn\u2019t lost and he hasn't made big-time blunders while the New Orleans defense has raised its game. The Saints are 3-point underdogs, having won each of Teddy B\u2019s four starts by 7 points or less. Winning the tight games says something about their grit, but facing a Bears D that was embarrassed in London will mark Bridgewater\u2019s toughest test yet.\n\nIf the playoffs started today \u2026 the Raiders would be in. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that Jon Gruden was a punchline. Not now. Coach Chucky\u2019s team heads to Green Bay with a chance to spring a third consecutive upset away from home, following the quality wins at Indianapolis and against Khalil Mack & Co. in London. At the moment, Oakland (3-2) would be the second AFC wild card team, with the win over the Colts working as a tiebreaker.\n\nYet with Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes battling injury issues, they are clearly in the race to contend for the AFC West crown. Four things working for Gruden\u2019s crew: 1. Derek Carr, more comfortable in Year 2 of the offense; 2. Rookie running back Josh Jacobs; 3. Emerging tight end Darren Waller; 4. A defense revamped with speed. A potential problem looms, however, with left tackle Trent Brown, accused of domestic assault in a civil suit.\n\nDid you notice? Buffalo\u2019s defense has gone from good to great in the third year under D-coordinator Leslie Frazier. The Bills bring the NFL\u2019s third-ranked unit for yards and fourth-ranked in scoring (14 points per game), which explains how a team that barely scores two touchdowns a game is 4-1. Last year, Buffalo\u2019s D ranked second in the league.\n\nThe improvement this season, so far, is effectiveness in the red zone. Without the type of star defenders who have toiled in Orchard Park in previous years (hello, Bruce Smith, Cornelius \u201cBiscuit\u201d Bennett and Bryce Paup), the results are a credit to what\u2019s been built by Frazier \u2013 who should be considered for another crack at a head coaching job when the next hiring cycle comes around.", "description": "Russell Wilson is the MVP front-runner after six weeks and has showed so far why the Seahawks made him the highest-paid quarterback in the game.", "authors": ["Jarrett Bell", "Published A.M.
