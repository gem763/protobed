Finely dice the shallots and finely shred the cabbage. Pan fry the shallots in a splash of oil until translucent, then add the cabbage and cook for a few more minutes. Add the spices and stock, and then cover with a lid and braise for about 40 minutes on low heat. Stir now and again and season at the end.\n\nNext, preheat the oven to 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F/Gas 4. Finely score the skin on the duck breasts with the tip of a sharp knife and season generously with salt and pepper.\n\nHeat an ovenproof frying pan over a low heat and lay the duck breasts, skin-side down, in the pan. Slowly cook the duck for 10\u201315 minutes, draining off the fat as you go, until the skin starts to turn crispy. Turn up the heat to brown the skin until crispy all over, then flip over the breasts and cook for a further two minutes. Transfer to the oven for three minutes, or until the duck breasts are firm to the touch but still quite pink inside. Remove from the oven, cover with foil and leave to rest for 10 minutes.\n\nDrain the fat from the frying pan and in the same pan, add one shallot finely diced. Sweat for about five minutes, being careful not to burn. Add the red wine and port and reduce for eight minutes. Next, add the stock and the strawberries. Cook for about 10 minutes. Check seasoning.\n\nTo serve simply pile up some cabbage, arrange some sliced duck on top and finish with a good spoonful of the sauce.\n\nRecipe from berryworld.co.uk", "description": "Pan roasted duck with braised cabbage For the braised red cabbage 2 shallots \u00bd red cabbage (about 200g) Olive oil 1 cinnamon stick \u00be cloves A grating of fresh nutmeg 100g vegetable stock For the duck 4 duck breasts Sea salt and pepper For the strawberry red wine sauce 1 shallot 400ml red wine 100ml port 200ml chicken stock 100g hulled and halved strawberries", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/16/pan-roasted-duck-recipe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
