We\u2019re back there in the trunk, man. Just take it easy for a lap. He had a fast car and he just run over us. Shoot us through the chicane and then we get a penalty for it. Every time he gets to me, he just runs over me.\n\n\u201cSmooth move of playing the sick card so I couldn\u2019t bust him in his mouth.\u201d\n\nThe liquid splashed on Fiege, Bowman and Fox Sports analyst and Hendrick Motorsports executive Jeff Gordon, who was kneeling to check in on Bowman (watch the video above). A NASCAR spokesman said officials would be talking to Wallace about his actions in the postrace incident.\n\nBowman, who was in a backup car after crashing Saturday and spun on the first lap Sunday after starting at the rear, advanced to the playoffs by finishing second behind Chase Elliott. Dehydrated after a long day in a hot car, Bowman received treatment at the care center postrace.\n\nAfter wrecking Wallace, he radioed his Hendrick Motorsports team that he was upset by being continually shown the finger.\n\nStory continues\n\nL42 \u2014 Caution after 88 spins 43. Per @KelliStavast, @AlexBowman88 told the team \"if he doesn't put that finger away, he's going to get one\" after he said @BubbaWallace gave many obscene gestures. #nascar \u2014 Nate Ryan (@nateryan) September 29, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten wrecked if he had his finger back in the car,\u201d Bowman told reporters afterward.\n\nAsked what Wallace had said to him, Bowman said, \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t repeat what he said to me. Nothing classy by any means.\u201d\n\nWallace, who rebounded to finish 24th and on the lead lap, declined to retaliate on track against Bowman as he had after getting wrecked at Watkins Glen International last month.\n\nWallace\u2019s crew chief, Derek Stamets, told NBC Sports that he didn\u2019t need to coach Wallace on avoiding revenge on a playoff driver.\n\n\u201cNo. he takes care of that himself,\u201d Stamets said. \u201cThat\u2019s his world right there. For the most part, I pay attention to springs, bars, shocks and tires, getting them in and out and keeping the car under him. Got to let the guys go out and race out each other. Be boring if we told him what to do every week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t just get worse than it did. It can just perpetuate forever, so maybe they\u2019re done. NASCAR needs some rivalries, so it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\nStamets said his team was disappointed that Bowman had wrecked Wallace with an obviously faster car after bumping him through the chicane.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d rather he raced us clean,\u201d Stamets said. \u201cI know he\u2019s frustrated to be behind us there, but we weren\u2019t horrible. It\u2019s probably the best Bubba has run on a road course all year, if not total.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of blatant for (Bowman) to just take us out. If he was that much faster, you saw how fast he was at the end, he could have passed us clean somewhere else. He just lost his patience, I guess.\u201d", "description": "Wallace was angry with being wrecked by runner-up Bowman during the race.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/z0aB7eDFdooQlzRIotpW6A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.lv76ROs1Gj4NEnVXSNc0A--~B/aD04Njk7dz0xNTQ2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/09e0fcd5dfa9a28f2bb7b6f237c696cb", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
