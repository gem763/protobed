When I was a kid, my mum would soften the blow with a new pencil case or lunchbox. Now, I cook.\n\nThese recipes are the kind I make on a Sunday with leftovers on purpose that I\u2019ll be able to use a few ways throughout the week, to make this return a little smoother. The mole is the kind of recipe which takes a bit of love, but ends up with the most rich, rounded and deeply fruity chilli sauce, which you can use to flavour roast veg, beans in tacos, burritos or as a traditional mole stew. The homemade flour tortillas work perfectly with the mole, but can also be heated up through the week.\n\nAncho chilli and peanut mole\n\nThis recipe makes four portions of the mole sauce: one to use in the recipe with the roast veg, and three to store in the fridge or freezer to use for a quick-from-the-freezer dinner (ideas below).\n\nWhole, dried ancho chillies are available from most supermarkets in the spice section. If you can\u2019t get your hands on them, you could use a heaped teaspoon of dried chilli flakes instead.\n\nPrep 15 min\n\nSoak 20 min\n\nCook 1 hr\n\nServes 4 (plus extra sauceleftover mole sauce for three more dinners)\n\nFor the mole\n\n4 dried ancho chillies, seeds and stems removed, or 1 heaped tsp dried chilli flakes\n\n1 onion, peeled and quartered\n\n3 garlic cloves, peeled\n\n3 vine tomatoes\n\nFlaky salt\n\n2 tbsp chipotle paste\n\n60g dark chocolate (70%), broken into squares\n\n75g peanuts\n\n75g almonds\n\n50g pumpkin seeds\n\n1 tsp cumin seeds\n\n75g raisins\n\n25g sesame seeds\n\n750ml vegetable stock\n\n\n\nFor the roast veg\n\n750g new potatoes, larger ones cut in half\n\n400g banana shallots, peeled and halved\n\n\u00bd butternut squash (about 500g), cut into large chunks\n\n2 corn on the cob, kernels cut from the cob\n\nOlive oil\n\nTo serve\n\nFresh coriander\n\nTortillas\n\nJuice of 1 lime\n\nRemove the seeds and stems from the dried ancho chillies, then Lightly toast the chillies in a dry frying pan, being careful not to burn them. Remove the chillies from the pan, put in a bowl of boiling water and soak for 20 minutes \u2013 if you are using dried red chilli flakes instead, just toast them (there\u2019s no need to soak).\n\nBring a medium saucepan of water to a boil, then add the onion, garlic, tomatoes and a good pinch of salt. Turn down the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the skins on the tomatoes start to come away and the onions are soft. Drain (retaining the chilli water), and put the solids in a high-speed blender with 200ml of the saved water and the chipotle paste. Blend really smooth, then, while still warm, add the chocolate and stir to melt. Set aside.\n\nToast the nuts, pumpkin seeds, cumin seeds and raisins in the same pan you toasted the ancho chilli in: you want them to be golden and well-toasted, so don\u2019t be afraid to take them a little further than you usually would. Add the sesame seeds for the last few minutes. of toasting Add all of this to the paste in the blender, then tip in the stock and a good pinch of salt. Blend smooth and silky, then empty into a large saucepan \u2013add a little more stock, if you want it looser.\n\nHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/gas 7. Put all the veg except the corn,In a roasting tray, add cutting any large potatoes in half in a large roasting tray. Add a good glug of olive oil, five tablespoons of the mole and sauce season, then give everything a good mix with your hands so it\u2019s all coated in the lovely smokey sauce. Roast in the oven for 35 minutes, adding the corn halfway and giving the tray a shake, until the veg is soft and the corn a little crisp. Gently heat the mole, then add a few spoonfuls of the silky sauce in to the bottom of each bowl. Top with the roast veg, charred corn, a little fresh coriander, tortillas and a squeeze of lime. Store any leftover sauce in the fridge for a week, or freeze in three portions for later (it will last in the freezer for up to three months).\n\nEasy flour tortillas\n\nPrep 30 min\n\nCook 20 min\n\nMakes 8 tortillas\n\n400g spelt or plain flour\n\n1 tsp bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)\n\n\u00bd tsp salt\n\n3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil\n\n250ml lukewarm water\n\nPut the flour, bicarbonate of soda and salt in a large bowl. Add the oil and water a little at a time, and mix until it comes together into a dough. Add a little more water if you think the dough is too dry \u2013 it should feel light and slightly wet before kneading.\n\nTip on to a floured surface and knead for a few minutes, adding a little more flour if needed, until soft, then divide the mix into 10 balls. Roll each ball out into thin circles, about 2mm thick, using a little more flour to stop them sticking to the rolling pin. In a large frying pan, dry-fry each tortilla for about a minute on each side, until slightly charred and toasted.\n\nKeep warm in a tea towel while you make the rest. Serve warm, or leave to cool, wrap in clingfilm, then freeze and warm in the oven when you want one.\n\nHow to use your mole sauce\n\n\u2022 In a saucepan, stir one portion of the sauce with a tin of drained beans (black or pinto beans are best). Serve on the warmed tortillas with a tomato salsa and some chilli sauce.\n\n\u2022 Spoon a portion of the sauce over a tray of veg, add a little oil, toss well to coat, then roast and serve in wraps, or with rice.\n\n\u2022 Use as a sauce for enchiladas or in burritos.\n\n\u2022 Stir into fried rice with vegetables for a quick leftovers dinner.", "description": "A rich and rewarding mole to smother roast vegetables in (with loads left over to use as you please in the week ahead), all mopped up by some super-quick tortillas", "authors": ["Anna Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52fb6ca51c51f47d4a4b634261ed91d3ae2965ac/0_1131_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1d5c1a4e2818720b06991506ea0225f6", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
