Other shipments were also made in 1948 and 1950.\n\nIran loaned the artifacts to the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute more than 80 years ago for research, translation and cataloging after university archaeologists uncovered them in the 1930s at the site of the ancient city of Persepolis. Another 17,000 artefacts from the initial loan remain in the U.S.\n\nIran and the U.S. have not had diplomatic relations since 1979.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
