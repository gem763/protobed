There will be bugs. Don\u2019t put more money on Lightning than you\u2019re willing to lose! \u2014 Lightning Labs\u26a1\ufe0f (@lightning) September 10, 2019\n\n\n\nVersions affected include all LND releases 0.70 and below, C-Lightning 0.70 and below, and \u00e9clair 0.3 and below.\n\nOlaoluwa Osuntokun image via CoinDesk archive", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
