Any further inquiries should be directed to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office.\"\n\nAnother source familiar with the matter confirms that the appeal was rejected.\n\nABC News\n\nIt was still unclear as of Thursday afternoon if the Justice Department had asked a federal grand jury to indict McCabe \u2014 and, if so, what the grand jurors decided.\n\nMcCabe's attorney Michael Bromwich sent two emails to senior DOJ officials Thursday, seeking clarity on where McCabe stands.\n\nMcCabe's legal team urged DOJ to say publicly that a federal grand jury declined to indict McCabe -- if in fact that's the case. And they again urged DOJ not to try to indict him again, insisting if it's true that prosecutors couldn't persuade a grand jury to indict, then they won't be able to persuade a trial jury to convict.\n\nIn the event McCabe is indicted by federal prosecutors, it would be the first instance of the Justice Department bringing criminal charges against a senior law enforcement official involved in the origins of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, which President Donald Trump and other conservative allies have described as rife with corruption and political bias.\n\nMcCabe, who served as the acting FBI director immediately following the firing of James Comey, has said he personally authorized the counterintelligence and criminal investigation of President Trump in May 2017 over fears he would too be removed from the position.\n\nMcCabe was fired from the FBI in March of 2018 just hours before his retirement, after the Department of Justice's inspector general released a report determining that he misled investigators while under oath.\n\nThe IG said McCabe \"lacked candor\" specifically about conversations he had regarding a disclosure to the Wall Street Journal about the bureau's investigation of the Clinton Foundation, and referred its findings to federal prosecutors in the spring of 2018.\n\nMcCabe has said he never \"knowingly misled or lie[d]\" to the investigators, but has also acknowledged he lacked clarity and had to correct some of his responses.\n\nLast month, McCabe filed a civil suit against the DOJ and FBI arguing his firing as unjust and politically motivated due to public pressure from President Trump.\n\nPresident Trump has long targeted McCabe as a political enemy and evidence of political bias in the upper echelons of the FBI early in his administration.\n\nOver Twitter, Trump has repeatedly encouraged a criminal investigation of McCabe.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700,000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia, led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe\u2019s wife in her run for office? Then dropped case on Clinton! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 18, 2018\n\nWow, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. He was fired for lying, and now his story gets even more deranged. He and Rod Rosenstein, who was hired by Jeff Sessions (another beauty), look like they were planning a very illegal act, and got caught..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2019\n\nThe Department of Justice and FBI did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment on the McCabe development.", "description": "The Justice Department has rejected appeals by lawyers for former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who urged DOJ to refrain from seeking an indictment against him.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/andrew-mccabe-01-abc-jef-190222_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
