That\u2019s just enough time for breakfast, lunch, ONE snack, and dinner.\"\n\nThe 12 hour fasting period includes sleeping time.\n\nWhat Michaels is suggesting isn't new. It's commonly referred to as intermittent fasting, which means alternating between certain periods of eating and not eating. The method of dieting has been used as a way to lose weight and for other benefits. A study from The National Institute on Aging last year suggests that intermittent fasting could be the key to longevity.\n\nBenefits of intermittent fasting:Can I lose weight intermittent fasting?\n\nMark Mattson, professor of neuroscience in the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, told Johns Hopkins Health Review that fasting several days a week could ward off Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s, and also improve memory and mood. Donald D. Hensrud at Mayo Clinic College of Medicine wrote in 2014, regular fasting could help cholesterol, and reduce \"risk of gaining weight and developing diabetes.\"\n\nMichaels, meanwhile, had a lot of specifics to share regarding the one snack she recommends per day. It should be comprised of \"40 percent carbs, 30 percent fat, and 30 percent protein\" and should make up 20 percent of your daily caloric intake.\n\nMichaels cautioned even seemingly healthy snacks like avocados can result in weight gain.\n\n\"That half an avocado you just ate for a snack might have 400 calories, and those extra calories add up,\" she writes. \"So yeah, even healthy foods aren\u2019t necessarily always good for you.\"\n\nShe continues: \"Don\u2019t mistake that cereal bar that\u2019s on your points plan for a healthy snack. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s a processed diet food, and it\u2019s garbage. It has no nutrient value, it doesn\u2019t have a good blend of macros, and it doesn\u2019t have fiber or healthy fats for good energy.\"\n\nJillian Michaels comes after CrossFit:Jillian Michaels, who slammed the keto diet, bashes CrossFit: 'It stops being effective'\n\nEarlier this year, Michaels came under fire for bashing the keto diet, the trendy weight-loss regimen tied to everyone from Al Roker to Halle Berry because she says it starves the body's cells of essential macronutrients.\n\n\"I don't understand. Like, why would anybody think this is a good idea?\" Michaels, 44, told Women's Health magazine, calling the keto diet a \"bad plan, for a million reasons.\"\n\nAccording to Michaels, the high-fat, low-carb diet ignores the reality that \"your cells, your macromolecules, are literally made up of protein, fat, carbohydrates, nucleic acids,\" and can threaten the body's overall health.\n\nRoker, the high-profile \"Today\" weather anchor, took to Twitter to slam Michaels for her remarks.\n\n\"So @JillianMichaels says #Keto is a bad idea. This from a woman who promoted on camera bullying , deprivation, manipulation and more weekly in the name of weight loss,\" he tweeted last week. \"Now those sound like bad ideas.\"\n\nContributing Cydney Henderson, Ashley May and Dalvin Brown", "description": "Jillian Michaels published an article in Women's Health Magazine where she suggests people eat one snack a day and fast for 12 hours.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/22/USAT/8ed5b536-3100-45ad-bd9c-986734c85d0e-GTY_1168515886.JPG?crop=3599,2025,x0,y183&width=3036&height=2025&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
