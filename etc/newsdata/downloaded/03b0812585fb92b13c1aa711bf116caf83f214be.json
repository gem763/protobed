He bought the largest tarp he could find, projected the school\u2019s logo onto it and cut out a template.\n\nBut the never-ending Twin Falls wind proved that plan a bust as he fought to keep the template in place while painting the Riverhawk logo at midfield, the Idaho Statesman reported.\n\n\u201cIt was terrible,\u201d Bishop said with a laugh. \u201cBut I did it and it was alright. It was just not very cool and not very big.\u201d\n\nNine years later, \u201cbig\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d only begin to describe Bishop\u2019s work. He has quickly made a name for himself as Idaho\u2019s premier field artist, emblazoning logos, images and tributes on athletic fields from Caldwell to Blackfoot.\n\nWeek after week, he turns bland football fields into works of art with argyle-style end zones and paintings at midfield stretching 20, 30, 40, even 60 yards wide. Highlights include military figurines for the Service Bowl (Canyon Ridge vs. Twin Falls), Jerome\u2019s logo under the Perrine Bridge for the Battle of the Bridge (Jerome vs. Twin Falls) and a hand raising Twin Falls\u2019 helmet, which he called his most intricate work to date.\n\nBishop started painting the yard lines for Canyon Ridge when his son played football for the Riverhawks. But his creative itch soon got the best of the co-owner of Creative Carpentry in Twin Falls.\n\n\u201cI have to have my hands in all kinds of different things because that\u2019s what I really kind of thrive on,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps me going. It\u2019s definitely an artistic release for me.\n\n\u201cI mean, the next day, whenever I get out of bed, I can\u2019t hardly stand up straight. I have a bad back, and I have to wear a back brace. Now I\u2019m supposed to have surgery. But you know, it\u2019s just, I just enjoy it so much, so I keep doing it.\u201d\n\nAfter his failed tarp template, Bishop moved on to sketching his ideas on graph paper. He divides the paper and field into yard lines and pieces the final project together grid by grid, largely freehanding his work with the help of a few control lines and strings.\n\nSome schools offer him ideas he builds off. Others just turn him loose and ask him to paint whatever he wants. Depending on the project, he estimates it takes him five to eight hours to finish a field. He said the work goes faster with his wife, Kim, by his side.\n\n\u201cShe knows what I want and how I want it, and we can just rock and roll,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cShe\u2019s my sidekick . She\u2019s been out there with me in the snow and the wind and the rain. (My business partner Blaise Kent) always says you better hang onto her because no one else would ever put up with that.\u201d\n\nEvidence of his work spread through social media, where Kimberly football coach Rich Bishop, his younger brother, has done most of the promotion. Visiting teams and opponents scouting on film also have created a buzz. Now, programs throughout Southern Idaho track him down whenever they need to inject their rivalry games, homecomings or senior nights with a big-game atmosphere.\n\n\u201cWe take pride in our facilities, and the kids know that,\u201d said Vallivue Athletic Director Tony Brulotte, who hired Bishop for the Falcons\u2019 home playoff game last year. \u201cBut when they saw we went above and beyond for them, you saw a different demeanor. You saw kids that were excited, kids that couldn\u2019t wait to get onto the field.\u201d\n\nThe attention has made Bishop\u2019s services a hot ticket. Twin Falls High hired him to maintain all of its fields after his son graduated from Canyon Ridge, so the Bruins\u2019 home games remain his bread and butter. But he\u2019s traveled around Southern Idaho during Twin Falls\u2019 road games, including stops at Vallivue, Jerome, Kimberly, Filer, Snake River, Wendell and Dietrich.\n\nHe\u2019s also spruced up fields for the 4A high school and American Legion baseball state tournaments, and regularly decorates the baseball and softball diamonds for the College of Southern Idaho.\n\nHe\u2019ll return to Jerome this week for the next Battle of the Bridge game against Twin Falls.\n\nMost middle-aged men fish, hunt or bowl for hobbies. Instead, Bishop would rather spend his free time giving back to schools and creating memories for high school athletes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how it\u2019s expanded. It\u2019s not for the money,\u201d said Bishop, who estimates he makes $1.50 to $2 per hour. \u201cI charge a little bit, but people always say why don\u2019t I do it for a living. Well, I\u2019d just be a starving artist.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Idaho Statesman, http://www.idahostatesman.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Like any artistic endeavor, it started with a failure - at least in the eyes of the artist.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Lycklama"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
