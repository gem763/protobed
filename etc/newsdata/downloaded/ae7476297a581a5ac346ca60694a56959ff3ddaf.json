PG&E began carrying out power blackouts for hundreds of thousands of customer homes earlier this month amid high winds and dry conditions that could have damaged power lines and sparked wildfires.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection blamed electrical transmission lines owned by PG&E for the Camp Fire in 2018. The blaze was the most destructive and deadliest in California\u2019s history, killing 85 people.\n\nJohnson later clarified his remarks.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to say we\u2019d be doing it on this scale for 10 years. I think they\u2019ll decrease in size and scope every year,\u201d he said.\n\nMarybel Batjer, president of the CPUC, criticized PG&E for the power outages, saying the utility company didn\u2019t take adequate steps to protect customers. The planned outages caused residents to stand in long lines at grocery and hardware stores to stock up on ice, coolers and other necessities.\n\nSchools and businesses shut down in the affected regions, hurting the economy. The outages cost the city of San Jose about half a million dollars.\n\n\u201cYou guys failed on so many levels on pretty simple stuff,\u201d Batjer said.\n\nDespite the power outages, the Saddleridge Fire sparked Oct. 10 in Southern California. Investigators haven\u2019t determined a cause for the blaze, but said it started in an area near a high-voltage transmission tower owned by Southern California Edison, which didn\u2019t carry out blackouts.\n\nAs of Saturday evening, the wildfire consumed 8,799 acres and was 72 percent contained, the Los Angeles Fire Department said.\n\nDuring evacuations, one civilian had a heart attack and died at the hospital. Eight first responders sustained injuries. The blaze destroyed 19 structures and damaged another 88.\n\nThe LAFD said low humidity and gusty winds over the next two days were expected to test the current containment.", "description": "Oct. 19 (UPI) \u2014 Planned power outages to reduce the risk of wildfires in California could go on for a decade, PG&E CEO Bill Johnson said as", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
