He is currently in intensive care, he is on life support and remains critical.\n\n'At the moment, doctors are unable to tell us an expected outcome and we are taking this hour by hour. However, doctors have advised that if George becomes stable enough, his brain, skull, face and spinal injuries will all require surgery before he could be flown home by air ambulance.\n\n'At this stage, we can't even comprehend what this may cost.'\n\nThe sisters managed to raise enough money to fly their parents to Ibiza to be with George at his bedside but the family was told that after 36 hours in hospital his medical bills were in excess of \u20ac12,000.\n\nA full investigation is now underway to determine what happened and a JustGiving page set up by George's sisters, Kelly and Jade Copeland, to help with medical bills has already raised \u00a310,516\n\nThe sisters managed to raise enough money to fly their parents to Ibiza to be with George at his bedside but the family was told that after 36 hours in hospital his medical bills were in excess of \u20ac12,000\n\nThe sisters added: 'He has such a big and generous heart, he will go to the ends of the earth for those he loves. He has more friends than we can count, and so many people have reached out to offer their support, just making us realise exactly how incredibly loved he is.\n\n'All we know is that if it were the other way around, George would be moving mountains to bring us home.'\n\nAlthough George did get travel insurance it hasn't been confirmed whether it will provide coverage.\n\nHis sisters say that even if it does, his policy only includes the costs for one next of kin.\n\nThey said: 'Due to the current uncertainty of his coverage, we are trying to raise funds to assist us with present and future costs both abroad and at home.\n\n'To put this in perspective, all of our money is focused on George's situation right now which is putting a massive financial strain on everything else.'", "description": "George Stephenson was on holiday with friends in Ibiza when he fell last week at the Hotel Playasol Mare Nostrum.
