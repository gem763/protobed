Mr. Trump has lamented the rise of \u201cObama judges,\u201d and a prominent Senate Democrat has told the court it\u2019s suffering a \u201ccrisis of credibility.\u201d\n\nThe public rejects both of those complaints.\n\nIn fact, when stacked up against the other two branches of government, the court is seen as far more credible. A whopping 57% picked the Supreme Court, 22% chose Congress and 21% put their faith in the White House.\n\n\u201cOn balance, the court does pretty well,\u201d said Charles Franklin, the professor who directs the Marquette poll.\n\nYet that\u2019s despite \u2014 or perhaps because \u2014 the public is largely ignorant of the court\u2019s members. A startling 28% of those polled couldn\u2019t name any of the nine justices, and another 11% could name one. Just 12% were familiar with eight or nine.\n\nThe most well known were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who has become a cult hero to liberals, and Brett M. Kavanaugh, whose nomination battle last year captivated the country. Still, both are unknown by about 2 in 5.\n\nJustice Ginsburg is viewed favorably, 41% to 17%. Justice Gorsuch received a 26% favorable rating and a 32% unfavorable rating.\n\nAt the other end is Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who has been on the court for a quarter century, but 84% of those polled said they didn\u2019t know enough about him to form an opinion.\n\nThe poll of 1,423 adults nationwide was conducted Sept. 3-13 and serves as a rebuke to those on both ideological wings who insist the court is tainted.\n\nForemost among those critics is Mr. Trump, who has complained bitterly about adverse rulings from judges appointed by Mr. Obama. A Washington Times analysis of immigration decisions found he has reason to wonder, with Democratic appointees far more likely than Republican appointees to strike down his actions.\n\nThe public doesn\u2019t agree.\n\n\u201cA solid majority believe that the court makes decisions primarily on the basis of law rather than politics,\u201d Mr. Franklin said. \u201cThe public as a whole does not see the intense partisanship on the court that Senate debate would maybe lead you to conclude, or for that matter interest groups.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump isn\u2019t the only critic. From the liberal side is Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, Rhode Island Democrat, who in a brief filed over the summer warned the justices against taking up a New York gun rights case. He told them they had lost the faith of the public to rule on the matter.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is not well. And the people know it,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe threatened a restructuring of the court \u2014 widely seen as an effort to pack the court with more justices to dilute the balance of five Republican appointees and four Democratic appointees.\n\nThat idea has also gained steam among Democratic presidential candidates. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, have signaled an openness to it.\n\nAmericans as a whole, though, don\u2019t like the idea, with 57% opposed. Democrats were more inclined toward the idea than Republicans or independents.\n\nWhat the public does favor is imposing term limits on justices, who currently serve for life. Of those polled, 72% said they wanted limits. That sentiment was strong across all party and ideological lines, suggesting the idea transcends the politics of the moment.\n\nVoters also don\u2019t want the Senate to allow politics to infect the court, the poll showed.\n\nAn overwhelming majority said Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, were wrong to refuse to hold a hearing for Judge Merrick Garland, Mr. Obama\u2019s pick in 2016 to take the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Mr. McConnell said the seat should be filled by the winner of the election, giving the public a say.\n\nBut 73% of the Marquette survey said that move was wrong.\n\nMr. McConnell said that should a vacancy arise in 2020, another election year, then he would move to fill it. He said the situation is different this time because the same party controls the White House and the Senate.\n\nAmericans, by a 69-31 split, agreed that a vacancy should be filled.\n\nMarquette also asked about some key upcoming cases in an effort to learn the outcomes Americans want to see \u2014 which is different from what may be legal.\n\nThe survey found Americans want the court to expand the employment nondiscrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to cover transgender people; want the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals deportation amnesty to be kept intact, over Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to nix it; and support public funds that flow to private schools to be used by all private schools, including those with religious affiliations.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
