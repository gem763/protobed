As Fox 2 Detroit reports, Fears was rushed to the hospital for a panic attack, which she experienced while having her makeup done for a Halloween marketing campaign with Glam Gore. However, when she arrived, the staff didn&apost initially realize she was wearing makeup, and instead, figured she had suffered a trauma to the face. Yes \u2014 her makeup looked that gory.\n\nIn fact, Fears told Fox 2 Detroit that it was actually the makeup that caused her to have a panic attack. \"It literally just shot up to my brain and it just caused like a really bad reaction,\" she said. For further context, she added: \"We were getting ready to do a photoshoot to do some marketing for Glam Gore for people who want to get their makeup done for the Halloween season.\" It was approximately three hours into having her makeup done when Fears started to feel anxious.\n\nA Woman's Intricate Zombie Makeup Was Mistaken for an Actual Medical Emergency More\n\nHer zombie makeup ended up so realistic that the hospital staff didn&apost recognize it was fake at first. \"[They said] let&aposs get her back to trauma now and she&aposs probably going into shock, she&aposs not making any sense,\" Fears told the Detroit publication. She added that she didn&apost speak up about the makeup because she figured that they had to know. \"I did not say anything because I just assumed they could see that it was fake,\" she explained.\n\nEventually, doctors realized Fears wasn&apost physically injured and she was treated for her anxiety attack. The Beaumont Hospital Royal Oak didn&apost comment on her specific situation but released the following statement:\n\n\"The emergency room is not a place for fun and games. They see many patients with severe medical issues where lives are at stake. Doctors need to be able to focus on those patients with true emergencies.\"\n\nAfter the fact, Fears posted about the incident on Facebook with the caption, \"Let me please say anxiety is no joke or laughing matter. It was a serious situation that happened at a strange time.\"\n\nNow read more about Halloween makeup:\n\nDone reading?
