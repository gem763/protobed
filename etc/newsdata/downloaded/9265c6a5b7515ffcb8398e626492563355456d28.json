A lack of marketing fanfare may have engendered a \u201csoft launch\u201d feel but with the winter codes finished things should quickly heat up. Western United will energise Melbourne fans, while the arrival of Robbie Fowler in Queensland could be the biggest thing to unite Brisbane since the Story Bridge.\n\nAdelaide United\n\nIns: Micha\u00ebl Maria (Charlotte Independence), Riley McGree (Club Brugge), Kristian Opseth (Erzurumspor), James Troisi (Melbourne Victory)\n\nOuts: Baba Diawara (released), Scott Galloway (Melbourne City), Craig Goodwin (Al-Wehda), Ken Ils\u00f8 (released), Isaias (Al-Wakrah), Apostolos Stamatelopoulos (Western United), Jordy Thomassen (De Graafschap)\n\nAdelaide should be there or thereabouts again this campaign but the continued lack of quality options in the final third means new coach Gertjan Verbeek\u2019s solid squad may struggle to last the course.\n\nA-League and W-League football to be televised live by ABC Read more\n\nVerbeek has the firm foundations laid by Marco Kurz to build on during his first taste of the A-League. Under their former boss United were solid defensively and hardworking around the ground, but they lacked a cutting edge up front. That problem does not appear to have been rectified conclusively in the transfer window, and not helped by the departure of Craig Goodwin, last season\u2019s top scorer. Even more significantly the Reds have lost their on-field talisman Isaias, one of the most influential leaders in the league during his six-year stint in South Australia.\n\nThe list of recruits is short with Micha\u00ebl Maria and Kristian Opseth headlining the international signings, while Riley McGree\u2019s return ensures the Reds boast one of the country\u2019s brightest midfield prospects.\n\nIn the short-term, a home FFA Cup final could provide an early season boost. Looking further down the track, the decision to bring former stars Bruce Djite, Carl Veart and Eugene Galekovic into the fold suggests the club\u2019s football department is in safe hands.

After an utterly abject 2018-19 the club has undergone wholesale change \u2013 a clean broom through the dressing room and the backroom too, with the well-known but simultaneously unknown \u201cmarquee manager\u201d Robbie Fowler taking the reins. It could go spectacularly right. It could also go incredibly wrong.\n\nIn the positives column they have snaffled a proven A-League goalscorer. With 39 goals in 78 A-League starts, Roy O\u2019Donovan is your literal one-in-two striker every team craves. Moreover, he could prove the perfect foil for rising star Dylan Wenzel-Halls, the unequivocal bright light amid last season\u2019s drudgery. In midfield especially, Roar look solid. Aidan O\u2019Neill was the diamond in Central Coast\u2019s 2019-20 roughery, Brad Inman and George Mells could prove handy, while after an injury-ravaged last season Stefan Mauk is as good as a new signing.\n\nThe massive variable is Fowler\u2019s foreign legion. Centre-back Tom Aldred has been handed the armband so should be sound, and if Aaron Amadi-Holloway, Macauley Gillesphey and Jay O\u2019Shea fire, this team could be very competitive. If they flop though, it could be one of the worst collective use of visa spots the league has seen. On top of all this, the Bakries remain. Let\u2019s hope off-field dysfunction won\u2019t hinder on-field performance; again. (RP)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tom Aldred will captain Brisbane with Roy O\u2019Donovan his deputy.

Coach Alen Stajcic put aside his own tumultuous year to steady the ship; now we find out whether his off-season recruitment and pre-season planning have been up to scratch to make the Mariners competitive once again.\n\nMark Birighitti is a massive in. They either do keepers brilliantly or awfully in Gosford, and the one-time Premier League signing could prove to be worth at least five to 10 points. The prodigiously talented Danny De Silva needs to stamp his mark on the A-League. This is the season to do it. While Giancarlo Gallifuoco, Dylan Fox and Sam Silvera are talented locals who could blossom with regular football.\n\nZiggy Gordon, Milan Duric and Kim Eun-sun bring much-needed experience, but there\u2019s still the feeling this squad is desperately short up-front. Matt Simon, Jordan Murray and Tommy Oar boasted seven goals between them last season from open play. If they struggle again, it could be another long, long season on the Coast.

Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP\n\nThe revolving door at Melbourne City has been spinning furiously since the end of last season with players, coaches and backroom staff coming and going at a rate of knots. This means City begin the new campaign as something of an unknown quantity with a remodelled squad under the guidance of a new gaffer, Erick Mombaerts.\n\nThe run to the FFA Cup final has confirmed Jamie Maclaren remains a goalscoring certainty at this level, and that Craig Noone looks among the highest quality signings of the offseason. More broadly, there should be real excitement at the potential minutes afforded to City\u2019s rich crop of young Australians. Connor Metcalfe has been pencilled in as Josh Brillante\u2019s midfield partner while Ramy Najjarine, Nathaniel Atkinson, Denis Genreau and others should all further their development.\n\nArguably City\u2019s biggest task lies off-field. Last season was a disaster with fans voicing their discontent with the club\u2019s hierarchy. With a new coach and a squad full of youthful promise, this is a golden opportunity for the City Football Group to demonstrate the merits of its ownership model, and bring a community along with them for the ride.

That reflects a broader reset with the core of last year\u2019s first XI also moving on to new pastures.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean a drop in expectations at the competition\u2019s standard bearers. Proven A-League quality in the form of Andrew Nabbout, Robbie Kruse and Adama Traore have returned to the club, but it is Victory\u2019s visa players that will hold the key to immediate success for new coach Marco Kurz. Kristijan Dobras, Migjen Basha, and Jakob Poulsen will be expected to combine in midfield and provide the ammunition for new skipper Ola Toivonen.\n\nWe know from his time at Adelaide that Kurz can organise a defence and with greater attacking talent at his disposal a much-changed Victory should once again be a force to be reckoned with.

The ever-wily Merrick may have a late transfer up his sleeve, but there\u2019s a lurking suspicion with a few loan deals and free transfers the only business done so far that owner Martin Lee\u2019s precarious financial situation might limit the veteran coach\u2019s options.\n\nThe back seven will remain relatively solid, but the front four remain a huge concern. Let\u2019s hope Abdiel Arroyo can bring Pana-mania to the A-League, not seen since his similarly alliterative countryman Yairo Yau. Otherwise beating the Mariners might be the only joy for the faithful this campaign.

Perth Glory will be near the top again in 2019-20.\n\nIt\u2019s a testament to the Glory administration that departures as potentially painful as Andy Keogh and Jason Davidson have been salved by the recruitment of Bruno Fornaroli and James Meredith, while the loss of Shane Lowry simply means more minutes for Tomi Mrcela.\n\nThe Asian Champions League campaign could throw a spanner in the works after Christmas, especially with a squad containing so many players nearer the end of their careers than the start, but that\u2019s nit-picking for a side that displays no obvious weak links, be it in personnel or tactics.

Moreover, they\u2019ve also already lit the sky blue touchpaper on the Sydney derby and the Big Blue \u2013 look forward to those.\n\nJosh Brillante for Luke Brattan is a high pedigree trade, while the return to Australia of Ryan McGowan is more than a handy replacement for last season\u2019s rare flop, Dutchman Jop van der Linden. With the back office stable and the academy starting to produce consistent young talent, it bodes as another good season for Sydney. And that\u2019s before you even mention Milo\u0161 Ninkovi\u0107 and Adam Le Fondre. (RP)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sydney FC start the new season with an improved squad.

And yet across the ditch there\u2019s a quiet confidence to Phoenix\u2019s off-season recruitment. Matti Steinmann and Ulises Davila come with a pedigree that could take the league by storm, while David Ball is the kind of hardworking striker that thrives in the A-League.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sarpreet Singh, Roy Krishna and David Williams will be missed by Phoenix this year. Photograph: Ross Setford/AAP\n\nAnd yet. There\u2019s one cavern-sized hole the Phoenix haven\u2019t \u2013 and in truth \u2013 might never replace: Roy Krishna. A genuine x-factor, the Johnny Warren medallist could single-handedly turn a contest. Take out David Williams, the mercurial Sarpreet Singh, Max Burgess and the best keeper in the league, Filip Kurto, and last season\u2019s heroics may be hard to repeat.\n\nAustralian fans may not be familiar with Stefan Marinovic, but the All Whites keeper is the real deal. If fit, Luke DeVere could form a tough-as-teak centre pairing with new skipper Steven Taylor, while Callum McCowatt and Reno Piscopo are genuine talents. A marquee striker is allegedly on his way: fingers crossed for that. They\u2019re down 35 goals from Krishna, Williams and Singh \u2013 they\u2019ll have to come from somewhere.

After three years without a home the Wanderers can finally enjoy the spectacular Bankwest Arena and with it the raucous home support that provided the soundtrack to the club\u2019s early successes \u2013 that is if Babbel can entice fans back after poor form and unsatisfactory temporary homes drove plenty away.\n\nRecruitment had to focus on defence and in Daniel Lopar, Daniel Georgievski, Matt Jurman and Dylan McGowan dramatic improvements have been made, while Pirmin Schwegler offers the experienced foil the promising Keanu Baccus requires to flourish in the centre of midfield. In contrast to last season, Babbel\u2019s headaches may now come in the final third following the departure of Alex Baumjohann and the long-term injury to his replacement Rados\u0142aw Majewski robbing him of an obvious playmaker. Nonetheless, a much stronger Wanderers \u2013 and a push for the finals \u2013 must be expected.

Their true potential will not be realised until their standalone stadium has been built, but there are grounds for optimism before then.\n\nUnder the direction of Steve Horvat and Lou Sticca, Western United have snapped up the most impressive young Australian manager going around and handed him a squad with the building blocks for immediate results. There\u2019s experience and character in the likes of Andrew Durante, Ersan G\u00fcl\u00fcm and Scott McDonald, international class in the shape of Alessandro Diamanti and Panagiotis Kone, proven A-League quality in Filip Kurto, Josh Risdon and Besart Berisha, and a sprinkling of exciting youngsters with Seb Pasquali, Dylan Pierias and Apostolos Stamatelopoulos all stars in the making.\n\nUps and downs are inevitable in a debut season, but on paper at least Western United have the raw materials to hold their own from the get-go.
