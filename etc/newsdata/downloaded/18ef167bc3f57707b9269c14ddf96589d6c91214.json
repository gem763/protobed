The theme this reporting season is \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d Or maybe it\u2019s \u201cAnything but more macro stuff.\u201d\n\nOn the whole, the numbers won\u2019t be good, but they\u2019ll be better than predicted. Analysts polled by FactSet say earnings per share for S&P 500 companies will fall 4.1% from the level a year ago. Most analysts follow the Showcase Showdown rule from The Price Is Right\u2014guess as close as you can, but don\u2019t go over\u2014so companies tend to beat estimates. Expect earnings to end up about flat for the quarter.\n\nThen comparisons get easier. By next year, Wall Street says earnings will jump 10%. I\u2019m giving that only half a hallelujah for now, and keeping the other half in escrow. With distant forecasts, analysts often start way too high, then slash their numbers to beatable levels closer to reporting time. Figure 5% growth next year. Anything higher, and I\u2019ll owe you a -lujah.\n\nAll depends on the economy, of course. This past week, one key report showed trouble for manufacturing, and stocks tanked for two days. Then jobs came in good enough, and stocks jumped. In the background, odds ended the week higher that the Federal Reserve will again cut interest rates. But UBS says that cutting rates from here could hurt stocks, rather than help them.\n\nSee what I mean about macro reports being a chore? I lose track of whether bad news is still good news, and if so, whether there has been so much of that kind of good news that it has reversed polarity to become bad news. Give me a few weeks of company results to clear my head. I\u2019ll watch the bellwether companies dutifully, but more interesting are the high-drama names that tend to move a lot around reporting time.\n\nStart with Netflix (ticker: NFLX). The company missed subscriber forecasts last quarter, causing shares to fall 10% in a day. They peaked above $400 last year and recently traded at $272. Investors have been losing patience with young companies burning cash; Netflix is a not-so-young company doing so. But it has also reshaped the media business, and long defied bears. It reports third-quarter results Oct. 16, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch calls it a make-or-break quarter. If subs don\u2019t shine, it\u2019s hard to imagine the path will get easier after Disney+ launches in November and other well-financed streaming services follow.\n\nNext, toys. Mattel (MAT) and Hasbro (HAS) both report later in October. Last quarter, their stocks jumped 13% and 10%, respectively, after both beat estimates, but the similarities end there. Hasbro is up 113% over the past five years, and Mattel has plunged 65%. It was about five years ago that Hasbro stripped Mattel of a massive licensing deal with Disney for princess dolls. Mattel has also struggled with Barbie falling out of favor. The brand could get snowed out this Christmas by Disney\u2019s Frozen 2, a film that hits theaters in late November and could be a real doll-mover for Hasbro.\n\nMore important for Mattel is what Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink calls a \u201chyper binary event.\u201d The company canceled a much-needed bond sale over an anonymous whistle-blower letter, but hasn\u2019t detailed the complaint. If it does so soon, and the matter isn\u2019t serious, its shares could gain 10% to 15%, according to Wissink. If it\u2019s bad, look out below.\n\nAT&T (T) hasn\u2019t had any double-digit percent moves on earnings recently. But it has gained or lost more than 3% each report\u2014mostly lost\u2014for nine straight quarters. That makes its Oct. 23 report a must-see. The shares look cheap, and a 5.4% dividend yield adds appeal. The phone business is strong. The problem is DirecTV. To young consumers, parabolic TV dishes might as well be media outhouses. If management can at least slow DirecTV cancellations as it shifts to streaming, added confidence in the dividend alone could send the stock higher.\n\nRetail reports won\u2019t pick up until November. Last quarter, Macy\u2019s (M) flopped and Target (TGT) soared. This time around, investors should watch Gap (GPS), especially its Old Navy chain. Old Navy has high overlap in its store locations with Forever 21, which has filed for bankruptcy protection and is closing stores. Over the long term, that puts market share up for grabs, but in the near term, it creates a glut of deeply discounted clothing for sale. Look for commentary on that from management during the earnings call. Gap has announced plans to spin off Old Navy, but results there have been weak of late. Gap shares haven\u2019t moved less than 4% on earnings over the past eight quarters.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) has had two big moves on earnings this year\u2014a 7% drop in April after revenue growth slowed to 17%, and a 10% gain in July after growth picked back up to 19%. Which will the third-quarter report resemble in late October? A recent rise in revenue estimates bodes well. So does the fact that analysts are still finding billions of dollars in the company\u2019s couch cushions. Mark Mahaney at RBC Capital Markets took a detailed look at Google Maps in September, and called it one of the greatest under-monetized platforms on the internet. Alphabet could pull a fresh $1.9 billion to $3.6 billion in revenue from it by 2021.\n\nShares of Alphabet trade at 22 times next year\u2019s projected free cash flow\u2014cheap enough, with or without the Maps money.\n\nWrite to Jack Hough at jack.hough@barrons.com", "description": "Earnings season could generate big moves\u2014up or down\u2014in shares of Netflix, Hasbro, Mattel, AT&T, and Gap.", "authors": ["Jack Hough"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-114067/social", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
