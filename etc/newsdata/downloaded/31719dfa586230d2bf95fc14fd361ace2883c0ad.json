Along one main street, more than 11,500 chairs will sit empty, representing those city residents killed during the conflict.\n\nThe war officially started on April 6 1992, the same day the European Union (then the European Community) recognised an independent Bosnian state.\n\nA day earlier, Serb forces fired on peace demonstrators in front of the Bosnian parliament. Two female protesters were shot dead. Those shootings began a bloodbath that led to the deaths of at least 200,000 people and forced around 1.8 million to leave their homes.\n\n\u201cI think the victims were killed for nothing. Nothing has been achieved. Maybe someone else thinks differently but this is what I think. On all sides, everything happened for nothing,\u201d said local resident Mira Regoje.\n\nThe Siege of Sarajevo was the longest siege of a capital city in modern history.", "description": "Commemorations are taking place on Friday to mark the beginning of the Siege of Sarajevo and the start of the Bosnian War exactly twenty years", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/archive/1000x563_archive.jpg", "published_at": "2012-04-06"}
