LOUIS (AP) - Officials at a St. Louis health center that serves needy, uninsured residents says a cyber-attack has caused a data breach that potentially affected 152,000 people.\n\nThe Betty Jean Kerr People\u2019s Health Center said Friday that the attack involved patient information such as addresses and social security numbers, but no patient medical records. Information on medical providers and health center employees also was breached.\n\nThe incident last month locked data and demanded a ransom to unlock it. The center says it refused to pay the ransom and contacted police.\n\nCEO Dwayne Butler says there is no way to know if the information has been viewed or accessed by the attacker. He says the center regrets \u201cany concern this incident may have caused our patients and customers.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Officials at a St. Louis health center that serves needy, uninsured residents says a cyber-attack has caused a data breach that potentially affected 152,000 people.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
