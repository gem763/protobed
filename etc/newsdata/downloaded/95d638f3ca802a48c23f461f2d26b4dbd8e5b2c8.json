According to The New York Post, the amount of money Beadle \u2014 who reportedly still has multiple years left on a contract with a $5 million annual salary \u2014 receives will depend on \u201cthe freedom she will be granted upon her exit\u201d and if she agrees to a non-disparagement clause (which sounds nearly mandatory).\n\nIt\u2019s possible Beadle could wind up with a role at Turner, but it sounds more likely she\u2019ll make a move to paid subscription site DAZN, which is run by former ESPN president John Skipper.\n\nThe news about Beadle comes on the heels of a report last month that ESPN would be adding Stephen A. Smith to its popular NBA Countdown studio show. Instead of Beadle, Rachel Nichols and Maria Taylor will be taking over as hosts of the show.\n\nNichols and her show The Jump are also expected to be taking on a bigger role in ESPN\u2019s programming going forward.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: RealClearLife, a news and lifestyle publisher, is now a part of InsideHook.
