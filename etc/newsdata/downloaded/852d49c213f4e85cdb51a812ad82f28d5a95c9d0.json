News reported that film producers were \"happy to see him\" as the work schedules were reduced to accommodate Kevin.\n\nThe stand-up comedian had fractured his spine in three places after his 1970 Plymouth Barracuda left the Mulholland Highway and plunged down a gully, crashing through a wooden fence in the process.\n\n(Image: Getty Images,)\n\n(Image: TMZ / BACKGRID)\n\nKevin was in the back seat with Rebecca Broxterman at the time, with her fianc\u00e9 and Hart's friend, Jared Black, the driver at the time.\n\nThe pair are now reportedly preparing to sue Kevin over their injuries, claiming he was negligent in not having the requisite safety features included in the rebuild, which was a birthday present to himself.\n\nThe injured couple are arguing that the classic car did not have proper safety harnesses or airbags.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThese safety features are common in cars nowadays but not in 1970 when the Barracuda was originally built but could have been included in the rebuild.\n\nThe car had a powerful 720 horsepower engine and it has been reported that the safety features should have been a minimum requirement but Kevin wanted 'authenticity'.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
