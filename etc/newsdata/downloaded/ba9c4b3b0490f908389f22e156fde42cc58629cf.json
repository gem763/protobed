Theresa May said again and again during the 2017 election campaign \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d. It\u2019s even in the Conservative Party manifesto (page 36).\n\nTheresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement was rejected by Parliament three times. If that isn\u2019t a bad deal, what is? Therefore, if the EU does not offer a better acceptable deal, the Conservatives are fully justified by their manifesto to go for \u201cNo Deal\u201d.\n\nJames Gordon\n\nLondon NW4\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI was brought up in Argentina and Brazil and expected politicians there to do anything to benefit themselves. I had always thought Britain was sensible, honest and legal. I cannot believe what is happening. All my friends abroad are wringing their hands at the state Britain is in, and it will take decades to recover our good name.\n\nP Stevens\n\nAddress Supplied\n\nBrexit is wronger than wrong on every level. The case of Anna Amato, as reported by Reuters today, whose parents brought her to the UK 55 years ago, illustrates something of just how wrong.\n\nAnna went to school here, followed by university and work. She understandably thought and felt that her right to residency was assured. Wrong!\n\nShe\u2019s now in a legal limbo with potentially just days to go.\n\nLet\u2019s take the next step and imagine just for a moment it was us.\n\nWhere is our world-renowned sense of decency?\n\nFor me, Brexit and racism are as inseparable as the biscuits and cheese I had for lunch.\n\nIt has no justification \u2013 lawfully (as the referendum was judged defunct and corrupt), and certainly none whatsoever economically or morally.\n\nAnd you can be sure that, one way or another, if we allow our fundamental values to be ransacked like this, it will come back to bite us \u2013 hard!\n\nHoping for good from Brexit is like Vlad the Impaler trying to claim immunity by good karma on the day of judgement.\n\nMaybe he got sent back as Boris Johnson to redeem himself but instead opted for a second reign of horror culminating in a blaze of destruction on Halloween?\n\nMichael Cunliffe\n\nWest Yorkshire\n\nSadly when Boris Johnson\u2019s gung-ho tactics fail and we leave the EU without a deal, his response will merely be an insouciant shrug followed by a feeble \u201cwell, at least I tried\u201d.\n\nChristopher Learmont-Hughes\n\nWirral\n\nIt has been slowly dawning on me what was really going on in Westminster. The declared intent doesn\u2019t match the actions of the government and what reasoning there has been is opaque at best.\n\nPatrick Cockburn\u2019s article crystallises it very succinctly. There is one big difference with the events in Turkey and the situation in the UK: Turkey didn\u2019t have the restraining hand of the EU courts and institutions to moderate extreme actions.\n\nSuddenly a possible reason for urgently leaving the EU becomes clear. Progress towards a dictatorship, however benignly it wants to be seen, would be severely hampered by our EU partners.\n\nOnce free of this, the centralisation of power can really get going.\n\nAshley Herbert\n\nHuddersfield\n\nClearly Boris Johnson thinks it\u2019s his Brexit. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s the people\u2019s Brexit. The people elect the House of Commons, so he should hand it back to the people\u2019s parliament or back to the people ourselves in a Final Say referendum. Preferably both.\n\nHe cannot claim that the people want any kind of Brexit, deal or no deal, and then deny both the people and our representatives their freedom to choose.\n\nIan Henderson\n\nNorwich\n\nCriticism of Ruth Davidson betrays a double standard\n\nWhy the criticism of Ruth Davidson\u2019s decision I wonder, seeing that the reason for standing down frequently given by male politicians is \u201cwanting to spend more time with my family\u201d?\n\nAnn Smith\n\nSouthport", "description": "It\u2019s nonsense for protesters to claim that \u201cnobody voted for no deal\u201d.\u00a0 Theresa May said again and again during the 2017 election campaign \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d.\u00a0 It\u2019s even in the Conservative Party manifesto (page 36).", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/31/19/Protest-march.jpg"}
