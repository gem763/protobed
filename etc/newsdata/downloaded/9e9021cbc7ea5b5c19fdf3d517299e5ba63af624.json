Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Tuesday that if House Democrats wanted to explore whether President Trump deserved impeachment, \u201ca great place to start\u201d would be with testimony from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general tasked with investigating alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).\n\n\u201cA great place to start would be the inspector general's report that was issued just three weeks ago, the scathing report about Jim Comey,\" Jordan told Nadler during Tuesday\u2019s hearing.\n\nDOJ WATCHDOG SUBMITS DRAFT REPORT ON ALLEGED FISA ABUSES TO BARR\n\nIn his report, Horowitz claimed that Comey, the former FBI director who was fired by President Trump, violated bureau policies by drafting, leaking and retaining his memos documenting private discussions with the president.\n\nRepublicans have maintained that Comey\u2019s actions were part of an anti-Trump agenda within the FBI prior to the 2016 presidential election, with other alleged participants including former FBI acting director Andrew McCabe and former FBI staffers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.\n\nJordan noted Tuesday that he had previously requested that Horowitz appear before the Judiciary Committee, only to be rebuffed by Nadler.\n\n\"When I asked the chairman when we might have an opportunity to question Mr. Horowitz, he said, 'I don't know. I haven't thought about that\u2019,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cOf course you haven't thought about that,\" Jordan added. \"Too busy trying to impeach the president. Too busy slapping subpoenas on Corey Lewandowski.\"\n\nJordan had said Monday that potential prosecutions of former FBI personnel could come from U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was tapped by Attorney General Bill Barr in May to probe the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nBut it will be \"a while\" before Durham's probe is concluded, Jordan said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Catherine Herridge and Joshua Nelson contributed to this report.", "description": "While testy exchanges between Chairman Jerrod Nadler and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski got most of the attention at Tuesday\u2019s House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, one Republican on the panel thought the proceedings should have taken entirely different direction.", "authors": ["Dom Calicchio"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/16/694940094001_6086752030001_6086751304001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
