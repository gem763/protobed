Take the goalkeeper: Simon Mignolet. The Belgian was never close to entering the 'world class' bracket but in Alisson Becker, Klopp acquired one of the finest in world football.\n\nRESULTS AT OLD TRAFFORD SINCE 2014 December 14, 2014: Manchester United 3-0 Liverpool September 12, 2015: Manchester United 3-1 Liverpool January 15, 2017: Manchester United 1-1 Liverpool March 10, 2018: Manchester United 2-1 Liverpool February 24, 2019: Manchester United 0-0 Liverpool\n\nTake the centre backs: Agger and Skrtel. Capable and competent at Premier League level, you will not find a Liverpool fan right now that would take either ahead of PFA Player of the Year and UEFA Men's Player of the Year Virgil van Dijk.\n\nRaheem Sterling was not the player he is now and while Luis Suarez would almost certainly take the spot at No 9 ahead of Firmino, the current crop show the immense redevelopment Klopp has overseen to make them one of the most celebrated sides in Europe.\n\nAnd then you have Manchester United, a club devoid of any sense of direction since the departure of legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nMoyes, even with a front-line of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie, was blown away by Liverpool towards the end of his reign.\n\nLiverpool's record at Old Trafford has been far from spectacular in the last decade but with every passing season they are becoming increasingly confident of turning up and winning.\n\nThe last league meeting at Old Trafford was a drab 0-0 as the sides cancelled each other out\n\nJordan Henderson (right) is the only survivor from that 2014 side that ran out as 3-0 winners\n\nDavid de Gea was in goal back in 2014 - although he will miss Sunday's showpiece after picking up an injury while away with Spain. Phil Jones started alongside Nemanja Vidic that day, but he has since fallen way down the pecking order so don't expect him to be involved.\n\nAnd then you have Juan Mata, the only other player still standing at the club who started in their last home league defeat to their bitter rivals. The Spaniard, given the dearth of options in attack right now, could get the nod.\n\nThe difficulty for United fans is watching a club that was once dominating regress to where they are now.\n\nCombined teams this week have made a mockery of the gap in quality between Klopp's team and the one at Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's disposal.\n\nAsk for a combined XI in 2014 and the conversation could have dragged on for hours, putting players in and then taking them out to try and settle on a team where both sides were evenly represented.\n\nIt would take a matter of minutes these days with the quality gap, from Salah to Daniel James, Fabinho to Scott McTominay, Andy Robertson to Ashley Young and a number of notable others.\n\nUnited head into the game on their worst start ever to a Premier League season. It has never been this bad in the Premier League era.\n\nLiverpool have been transformed in the last five years by adding world class quality to the side\n\nJurgen Klopp has made Liverpool a force while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (right) struggles badly\n\nThe quality gap, on paper at least, is bigger now as United have failed to maintain their levels since Ferguson departed. Leaders like Vidic, who got sent off back in 2014, have departed and promising young talents have come in in a bid to put the club back on track following a number of expensive mistakes - Alexis Sanchez, Angel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao three obvious ones.\n\nLiverpool are flying high and supporters can barely stop smiling. That is not something they have got used to doing at Old Trafford - as February's drab 0-0 attests to.\n\nBut with United on their knees and Liverpool with the confidence to beat anyone in world football, their five-year wait for a three-point party could come to an end on Sunday night.", "description": "When Jordan Henderson leads Liverpool out at Old Trafford on Sunday to the sound of\u00a0This Is The One by the Stone Roses, he finds himself in an exclusive club.
