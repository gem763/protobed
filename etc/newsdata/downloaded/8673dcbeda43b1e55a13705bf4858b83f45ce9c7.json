He also asked the construction and manufacturing sectors to reduce activities that release pollutants.\n\nSmog levels are expected to stay high for the next two or three days.\n\nThe head of the country\u2019s Pollution Control Department, Pralong Damrongthai, said the visibly dirty air was not caused by smoke originating from forest fires in Indonesia. Since last month, haze blown by monsoon winds from fires in Indonesia has affected nearby countries including the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and parts of southern Thailand, raising concerns about aviation safety and health.\n\nIndonesian officials say they have made progress in containing the fires, including successful efforts at rainmaking, which they say reduced the number of fire \u201chotspots\u201d from more than 5,000 about two weeks ago to 491 on Sunday.\n\nThailand\u2019s Pralong told Thai PBS television that the problem in Bangkok is due to still air and high humidity becoming loaded with ultrafine dust from vehicle emissions, construction sites and other pollutants. He said it was then trapped close to the ground by a blanket of warm air in what meteorologists call an inversion.\n\nThailand\u2019s government has set a safe level of 50 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter of air, although other countries have lower limits. The Pollution Control Department\u2019s website put Monday\u2019s level as high as 79 micrograms.\n\nPM2.5 particulates are small enough to be sucked deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, and can cause respiratory problems and may raise risks of cardiovascular disease and cancers.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time this year Bangkok has been blanketed with a cocktail of pollutants. Smog levels also spiked back in January.\n\nPralong acknowledged the pollution levels might shoot up again in January and February, during the dry season, when farmers burn fields to make way for new planting, another factor that contributes to the problem. He said his department and other units are preparing more stringent measures to better handle the problem than earlier this year.\n\nAs the noxious smog settled over Bangkok, many residents fished out masks from drawers and went about their business.\n\n\u201cA lot of my friends are saying they come to the office, their noses are running. Their eyes really hurt. All of them are really coughing today. It\u2019s not normal anymore,\u201d said Piyavathara Natthadana, an office worker who was wearing a mask.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much we can do. We have to monitor the news and protect ourselves,\u201d said Chakrapong Sanguanjit, another Bangkok resident walking downtown with a mask on.\n\nSome environmentalists blamed the government for failing to act fast enough, despite being well aware of the issues.\n\n\u201cThe cause of the problem is the same. The sources of the pollution are the same. But measures to control the sources of pollution are not implemented yet because they said that takes time,\u201d said Tara Buakamsri of the environmental group Greenpeace.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Thailand's prime minister urged residents of Bangkok to wear face masks on Monday after smog covered parts of the capital in what some fear is a harbinger of more pollution to come.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerry Harmer", "Busaba Sivasomboon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/thailand_smog_68889_c0-146-3500-2186_s1770x1032.jpg?28e1112a076ec7fecf74d701fc168de288d8a301", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
