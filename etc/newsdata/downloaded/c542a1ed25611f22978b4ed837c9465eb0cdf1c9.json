I just want to create big plays for my teammates and put them in a position to win,\u201d Flowers said.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what he did.\n\nFlowers came into the game with just one sack before he simply overpowered Giants left tackle Nate Solder.\n\nThere are two ways to look at that:\n\nFlowers did what was expected against Solder.\n\nIt would be worse, and more eye-popping, if Flowers didn\u2019t produce some pressure against Solder, who had allowed 26 quarterback pressures and five sacks in his first seven games this season, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nSo the sacks were there for the taking \u2014 they always are against Solder \u2014 and Flowers produced. Finally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to the defense on those plays that allowed me to be able to get back there,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cI just made the play when it came to me.\u201d\n\nHis sacks came on successive plays at a crucial time in the fourth quarter when the Lions were holding onto a 31-19 lead. Keen observers know this about the Lions: No lead is safe.\n\nThe Giants advanced to the Detroit 43-yard line, but Flowers recorded back-to-back sacks to end the drive.\n\n\u201cThere were some pretty big plays out there, pretty big moments,\u201d Lions coach Matt Patricia said. \u201cAnd I thought \u2014 we always talk about trying to stay in the moment \u2014 not thinking about what\u2019s the next thing, what\u2019s going to happen and do all of that. I thought the guys did a good job of that. That\u2019s the biggest thing for us, just play that play in that moment, and for the most part I thought we were pretty good.\u201d\n\nSack artist\n\nA sack is an individual stat, but it\u2019s also an indication that other defensive players are doing their jobs.\n\nFirst, the defensive line has to keep the quarterback in the pocket. The defensive backs have to hold coverage, forcing the quarterback to wait a split second.\n\nAnd the rusher has to make a move to get free.\n\n\"Collectively, as a team, guys make them hold the ball, guys keep him in the pocket,\" Flowers said. \"A lot goes with a sack. Obviously, to get home and create a big play feels good.\u201d\n\nFlowers showed off two different moves to bring down Giants quarterback Daniel Jones.\n\nOn his first sack, Flowers started off with a bull rush and grabbed Solder and threw him to the side.\n\n\u201cOn the first one, I snatched,\u201d Flowers said.\n\nYes, more snatching. That\u2019s what the Lions need.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the same thing I did at Green Bay,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe ones where you got called for grabbing his face?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it goes,\u201d he said, smiling.\n\nOn his second sack, Flowers started off with a bull rush.\n\nBut instead of doing a snatch, he simply continued on a bull rush.\n\n\u201cOn the second one, I continued to push him back,\" Flowers said. \"A bull rush.\u201d\n\nBoom. Down goes Jones.\n\nFinally, some pressure\n\nJones had all kinds of time against the Lions in the first half. The Lions didn\u2019t record a quarterback hit and Jones completed 12 of 16 passes. But the Lions dialed up more pressure in the second half.\n\n\u201cWe made a lot of adjustments and a lot of corrections in the game that we were trying to make, and changed some stuff up mid-way to do the best we could to hang in,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cGive the players credit, I thought they tried really hard, and like I said, I think that\u2019s a good team there \u2014 the Giants.\u201d\n\nThe Lions finished the day with five quarterback hits.\n\nFinally, they started to get some pressure on a quarterback.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never really perfect,\u201d Patricia said. \"We just try to be right, and the more we can be right together, then the better off we\u2019re going to be. (I\u2019m) really proud of some of the effort out there, I thought it was really good. I\u2019m always proud of those guys the way they work to be honest with you.\"\n\nIn the end, the Lions won a game they had to win.\n\nThey finally got some pressure on the quarterback.\n\nAnd the defense made some huge plays.\n\nIf only they could play the Giants every week.\n\nContact Jeff Seidel: jseidel@freepress.com.
