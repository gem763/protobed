Add Interest\n\n\u201cThere's going to be a double-digit drop in criminal alien arrests this year directly related to what's going on at the border and the fact that we had to put more people in detention than we had room for,\u201d Acting ICE director Matthew Albence said in the White House briefing room.\n\nErik S. Lesser/EPA via Shutterstock\n\n\u201cWe've had to re-deploy a lot of our interior enforcement resources that would be taking criminal aliens off the street to deal with the onslaught of the surge that was occurring,\u201d Albence said.\n\nICE did not provide data on this year\u2019s arrests. In 2018, the agency made 7,449 criminal arrests compared to 5,790 criminal arrests in 2017.\n\nFlanked by local law enforcement officials, Albence decried \u201csanctuary city\u201d policies that he said obstruct federal law enforcement from making immigration arrests, saying: \u201cWhy do they want these criminals released back in the street instead of being removed from the country?\u201d\n\nThe news of falling arrest numbers came in response to questions by ABC News about the Trump administration\u2019s ability to forge partnerships with local jurisdictions which Albence said are needed to arrest undocumented immigrants who have been incarcerated in the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration has seen pushback from local law enforcement officers who worry the strong rhetoric out of the White House is making it less likely that undocumented immigrants will report crimes for fear of deportation.\n\nWhen Trump said early this summer that ICE would start targeting \u201cmillions\u201d of undocumented immigrants, the announcement rattled immigrant communities even though the enforcement operations that followed were relatively routine.\n\nThe announcement comes as the Trump administration continues to grapple with the aftershocks of its controversial zero-tolerance policy, which called for the prosecution of every adult who crossed the border illegally, even those traveling with their children. The result was some 2,600 kids separated from their parents in a matter of weeks.\n\nLast month, President Donald Trump announced a new plan to try to deter migration to the U.S. He said he plans to detain families together by lifting a longstanding 20-day limit on children in detention. That plan faces court challenges.\n\nOverall, ICE removals still lag significantly behind those carried out under President Barack Obama, whose administration also saw a flood of families and unaccompanied children arrive at the border in 2014.\n\nObama\u2019s Department of Homeland Security issued a list of priorities for immigration enforcement with a focus on felons and violent criminals. The Trump administration removed those priorities. But Albence insisted Thursday that the results were essentially the same, saying \u201c90 percent\u201d of people removed from the country were dangerous criminals or repeat immigration offenders.", "description": "As the Trump administration grapples with the aftershock of the crisis at the southern border, the number of criminal aliens arrested by ICE dropped significantly.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/Albence-1-sh-er-190926_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
