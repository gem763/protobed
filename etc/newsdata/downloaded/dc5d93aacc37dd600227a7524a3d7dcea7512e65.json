And companies with \u201cstrong business models, good teams, and [those] that can maintain a spirit of entrepreneurship are pushing forward relentlessly.\u201d\n\nWhile the number of super-rich\u2014defined as those having personal wealth of at least $290 million\u2014declined, their average net worth rose 10% from last year to $1.4 billion.\n\nLast year\u2019s wealthiest figure, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, remained at the top with a net worth of $39 billion, 2% higher than in 2018.\n\nPony Ma, of tech giant Tencent, was just behind, with $37 billion, up 8% from last year, pushing him ahead of property guru Xu Jiayin, whose wealth has dropped $13 billion over the last two years, when he was king of the list.\n\n\u201cThe China Rich List is now looking like a two-horse race,\u201d Hoogewerf says.\n\nThere was an exodus of names who didn\u2019t make the $290 million cut this year. After a stunning 456 individuals fell off the list last year, another 266 dropped off this time around.\n\nHoogewerf says that \u201c40% of the Hurun Rich List two years ago failed to make the cut this year, the biggest drop since records began 21 years ago. This works out at an average of one richlister dropping off each day for two years.\u201d\n\nThe report showed that food had a good year and manufacturing had a bad one. Husband-and-wife pig farmers Qin Yinglin and Qian Ying tripled their wealth to $14 billion, putting them in the top 20. They sold a reported 5.8 million pigs in a market when pork prices skyrocketed due to an outbreak of African swine flu.\n\nOther notable list-makers were 17 people who are currently in legal trouble\u2014one of whom is already in prison, one who was charged with molesting a child, and one who\u2019s been arrested for intentional homicide.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive display of wealth-gain was from Colin Huang, 39, the founder of bargain e-commerce site Pinduoduo. In a mere four years after founding the company Huang is now worth $19 billion.\n\n\u201cNobody in the world has ever made that much from a standing start,\u201d Hoogewerf says.\n\nHuang was one of 156 individuals under 40 to make the list this year.", "description": "New report shows more money is being held by fewer hands among the country\u2019s ultra-wealthy", "authors": ["Tanner Brown"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-115821/social", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
