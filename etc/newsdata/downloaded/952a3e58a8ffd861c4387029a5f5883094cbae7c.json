Defiant opposition lawmakers voted to suspend him from office and appointed a vice president who recently broke ranks in his place.\n\nThe 35-member Organization of American States on Tuesday urged Peru\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal to weigh in on the feud as both sides accused the other of abusing power and jeopardizing the nation\u2019s stability.\n\nThe military and governors stood by Vizcarra while several private business coalitions announced they would back Mercedes Ar\u00e1oz, who legislators swore into office late Monday night as the country\u2019s rightful chief of state.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Vizcarra is likely to continue governing as president while any challenge from the opposition works its way through court. He has already called for new legislative elections in early 2020.\n\nBut if congress prevails, lawmakers would be entitled to stay in their posts till 2021, calling off Vizcarra\u2019s elections and likely moving to impeach him, all moves that could irritate an already angry public with little to no faith in elected leaders.\n\nTeresa Tintaya was among a handful of protesters outside congress Tuesday yelling phrases like, \u201cGarbage congress, the people hate you!\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Vizcarra is a brave man,\u201d she said.\n\nEven before the turmoil, the nation was already on shaky political ground. Nearly every living former president has been ensnared in the mammoth Odebrecht corruption scandal, in which the Brazilian construction heavyweight admitted to funneling money to politicians around Latin America in exchange for handsome public works contracts.\n\nLower-ranking but still powerful judges, lawmakers and businessmen have been caught on wiretaps negotiating backroom deals, leading many Peruvians to conclude that no branch of their country\u2019s turbulent government can be trusted.\n\nVizcarra rose to power last year after President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned in relation to the Odebrecht probe and made defeating corruption his signature drive. He has succeeded where his predecessor failed in gaining the public\u2019s support, but repeatedly clashed with congress ruled by opposition leader Keiko Fujimori\u2019s party.\n\nUnder Peru\u2019s law, Vizcarra is entitled to dissolve congress if it rejects two votes of confidence in his administration. Whether or not two such votes have taken place is at the crux of the conflict between the executive and legislative branches.\n\nVizcarra contends a rejection vote during Kuczynski\u2019s administration counts as the first because he is continuing his predecessor\u2019s mandate. He argues that the second happened Monday when lawmakers proceeded with a vote to select new Constitutional Tribunal magistrates, defying his warning that he would interpret it as a vote against confidence.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, opposition lawmakers rushed to approve a vote of confidence that they say in effect inhibits Vizcarra from closing congress.\n\nPedro Olaechea, president of the dissolved legislature, said Tuesday that he and others believe the president\u2019s act was a \u201cnew sort of coup.\u201d He said lawmakers are deciding how to proceed but that what is likely to follow will be a \u201clengthy, tedious and delicate legal matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe event we are living will generate much uncertainty,\u201d he said.\n\nThe OAS, in its statement, said the Constitutional Tribunal, the same institution at the center of the feud, should decide on the legality of Vizcarra\u2019s action, but the regional body also characterized the call for new elections as a \u201cconstructive step.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s appropriate for the political polarization the country is suffering from be resolved by the people at the polls,\u201d the organization said.\n\nThe Constitutional Tribunal is expected to decide several important cases in the months ahead, including a habeas corpus request to free Fujimori, who is being held as prosecutors investigate her for allegedly laundering money from Odebrecht.\n\nThough the terms for all six magistrates had expired, Vizcarra, legal observers and human rights groups criticized the congressional action for its speed and lack of transparency. The newspaper El Comercio reported Monday that six of the candidates up for consideration are facing potential criminal or civil charges for offenses including kidnapping, extortion and sex abuse.\n\nBy law, congress is responsible for appointing the new judges, a stipulation that Vizcarra contends fuels political conflict.\n\nThe one magistrate selected by lawmakers Monday before congress suspended voting is a relative of the head of the legislature. It is still unclear whether the newly appointed judge might take his seat and if so who he would replace and how that might change the balance of the tribunal.\n\nRigoberto Cueva, who was demonstrating in favor of Vizcarra on Tuesday, said that whatever happens in court, it is clear what the public is clamoring for.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Vizcarra who has won here, it\u2019s the people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the people have been demanding that congress be closed.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Franklin Brice\u00f1o reported this story in Lima and AP writer Christine Armario reported from Bogota, Colombia.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A struggle between Peru's president and congress over who will govern the country threatens to become a lengthy, destabilizing legal battle.", "authors": ["Franklin Brice\u00f1o", "Christine Armario"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/peru-political-crisis.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C124px%2C5274px%2C2760px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
