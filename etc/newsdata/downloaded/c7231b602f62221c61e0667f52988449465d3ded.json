It also seeks to establish a new fund to pay for future mental health care for families who faced separation.\n\n\u201cAlthough separated families can never be made whole, justice requires redress for their suffering,\u201d the families say in their lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit piggybacks on complaints by mental health experts who say separating children from parents leaves lasting scars on the children.\n\nThousands of children were separated during the zero tolerance policy, which lasted several months during spring 2018.\n\nThe policy was announced by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and it was focused on prosecuting parents who jumped the border illegally with their children.\n\nTraditionally only about 20% of unauthorized crossers faced criminal charges \u2014 the rest were put in deportation proceedings, but escaped criminal penalties.\n\nUnder zero tolerance, the rate shot to about 50%, as parents \u2014 who\u2019d previously been off-limits \u2014 began to face charges.\n\nThe separations were a side effect of the prosecutions. Since there\u2019s no space for families inside prisons or jails, when the parents were prosecuted their children had to be taken away, and were turned over to the federal Health Department for keeping.\n\nYet Homeland Security and the Health Department lacked the ability to easily reunite the children with the parents once they were released.\n\nSome separations stretched months, and stories of distraught children traumatized by the experience shook the country.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
