Brian Karem, Playboy magazine senior White House correspondent\n\nLast November, the White House temporarily revoked CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s pass after an intern attempted to grab a microphone from his hand during a heated exchange between the reporter and the president.\n\nCNN then sued the president and White House staff, eventually dropping the suit after Acosta\u2019s credential was restored.\n\nIn a statement to HuffPost, Boutrous said he\u2019s \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the outcome of his client\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cThe White House\u2019s suspension of his press credentials violated the First Amendment and due process,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the wake of the judge\u2019s ruling, Grisham spoke out against the decision in a statement, claiming it \u201cessentially gives free [rein] to members of the press to engage in unprofessional, disruptive conduct at the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Karem\u2019s conduct, including threatening to escalate a verbal confrontation into a physical one to the point that a Secret Service agent intervened, clearly breached well-understood norms of professional conduct,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Press Secretary must have the ability to deter such unacceptable conduct.\u201d\n\nKarem\u2019s pass was suspended on Aug. 5, nearly a month after his July 11 altercation with Gorka.\n\nIn footage of the spat, Gorka can be heard asking Karem, \u201cYou\u2019re threatening me in the White House? In the Rose Garden?\u201d\n\nHe then declares that Karem is \u201cnot a journalist,\u201d but a \u201cpunk.\u201d As the confrontation fizzles and Gorka marches off, Karem yells back, telling him to \u201cget a job.\u201d After his client\u2019s press pass was suspended, Boutrous contended that the White House made an \u201carbitrary decision\u201d to \u201cpunish reporters and press coverage that President Trump doesn\u2019t like.\u201d This article has since been updated with Grisham\u2019s statement.", "description": "Brian Karem's credential was suspended in August after his Rose Garden altercation with former White House aide Sebastian Gorka.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6eef422500007e040234e7.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
