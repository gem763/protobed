More hard-line figures have attacked him as insufficiently committed to the president\u2019s immigration agenda, while critics of those policies argue he has used conciliatory rhetoric to lend cover to harsh measures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump in turn had questioned whether McAleenan was loyal to him.\n\nA person close to McAleenan said he resigned Friday after weeks of growing disenchantment with his standing in the administration. He was never formally nominated for the job.\n\nIn a message Friday night, McAleenan thanked the president.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the President for the opportunity to serve alongside the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security. With his support, over the last 6 months, we have made tremendous progress mitigating the border security and humanitarian crisis we faced this year, by reducing unlawful crossings, partnering with governments in the region to counter human smugglers and address the causes of migration, and deploy additional border security resources,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t have control over is the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time,\u201d McAleenan said in an interview with The Washington Post. \u201cThat\u2019s uncomfortable, as the accountable, senior figure.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKen Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, is viewed as a potential replacement. The former Virginia attorney general has distinguished himself in the role by making frequent television appearances during which he often weighs in on the affairs of other DHS agencies, appearing at times as a more eager spokesman for the president\u2019s immigration policies than McAleenan himself.\n\nAcrimony between Cuccinnelli and leading GOP senators would be a major obstacle to his confirmation though, and the administration would have to perform a series of bureaucratic maneuvers to go outside the order of succession and leapfrog him into the acting secretary role.\n\nAD\n\nMcAleenan\u2019s tenure at DHS was marked by the implementation of several contentious border policies that have significantly tightened access to the U.S. asylum system \u2014 policies he has defended as necessary to \u201crestore integrity\u201d to a U.S. immigration system swamped with a backlog of nearly 1 million pending cases.\n\nAD\n\nMcAleenan has been more isolated in recent weeks after the departure of several top aides and close allies in recent months. In addition, his relationships have been strained with other senior figures, especially Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, and Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nMcAleenan\u2019s exit leaves the bare-bones leadership structure at DHS even thinner. Every major immigration agency is run by leaders in acting roles.\n\nAD\n\nDHS was created after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and previous presidents have placed a high priority on having a Senate-confirmed leader running the department, which has 240,000 employees and a $50 billion annual budget.\n\nTrump, who has said he prefers leaving top officials in \u201cacting\u201d roles in order to make it easier to remove them, left McAleenan in the job without a nomination for six months, longer than any other previous DHS chief.\n\nAD\n\nDHS\u2019s acting deputy secretary, David Pekoske, is next in line to succeed McAleenan. Pekoske, who is also the top official at the Transportation Security Administration, is the only other senior DHS leader who has been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nAD\n\nUnlike McAleenan, Pekoske does not have a background in immigration enforcement, and he has told others he would like to return to his job running TSA full time.\n\nMcAleenan\u2019s departure opens the possibility the president will seek to install a more hard-line figure at the top of DHS for his reelection campaign. In his tweet Friday, Trump said he would name a new acting secretary next week.\n\nTrump installed McAleenan, 48, at the head of DHS after removing then-secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, saying he wanted someone \u201ctougher\u201d in the role, and told aides that McAleenan had the look he was going for, with the trim, stern demeanor of a federal agent.\n\nAD\n\nTrump was willing to look past the warnings of border hawks who told him McAleenan was an \u201cObama guy\u201d raised in California who had a record of donating to Democrats.\n\nAD\n\nTrump said in June that he was preparing to place former ICE director Tom Homan in the role of a White House \u201cborder czar.\u201d Homan did not accept the position, but several administration officials have speculated that the president will establish such a role at the White House to coordinate among federal agencies responsible for immigration and border enforcement.\n\nAsked last month why Trump had not nominated McAleenan for the DHS job despite praising his performance, White House officials declined to comment.\n\n\u201cSecretary McAleenan is doing a fantastic job implementing the president\u2019s plan to secure the southern border, build the wall, halt illegal immigration and stop the dangerous practice of catch-and-release,\u201d said Hogan Gidley, the deputy White House press secretary, in a statement to The Washington Post at the time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis departure opens a place for the president to install a more hard-line figure at the top of department, something supporters have urged.\n\nMcAleenan\u2019s exit ends a nearly 20-year career in federal law enforcement. He was recruited to join CBP after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, creating and running the agency\u2019s anti-terrorism office. At 35, he was port director in charge of security for Los Angeles International Airport and 17 other airports in southern California.\n\nHe was confirmed as CBP commissioner in March 2018 by a 77-19 vote, a margin reflected his standing among Democrats as a moderate and a career official.\n\nAD", "description": "McAleenan had been frustrated with a cadre of Trump\u2019s appointments to senior immigration roles and recently said he was struggling to control his department.", "authors": ["Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Nick Miroff", "Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/036cBfq3yi2BdwPk5yCZ5UMwkOo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MKXOQZHMQMI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
