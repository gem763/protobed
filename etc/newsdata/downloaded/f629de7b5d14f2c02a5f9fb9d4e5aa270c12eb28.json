The defense, which coach Dino Babers was counting on to be a difference-maker, gave up 104 points in the two losses, and the up-tempo offense under new quarterback Tommy DeVito has been inconsistent. He was sacked eight times and forced to hurry his throws seven other times by the swarming Clemson defense.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of growing, trying to get better every game,\u201d said DeVito, 60 of 101 for 678 yards and three TDs with four interceptions on the season. \u201cIt can go downhill in a hurry. We\u2019ve got to keep climbing up that mountain.\u201d\n\nFor Lester, a record-setting quarterback in college for the Broncos, the game plan is simple.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get after him if we can, try to put people in his face cause he\u2019s had people in his face,\u201d Lester said of DeVito. \u201cThat\u2019s an explosive offense and they haven\u2019t really got in rhythm yet. We have to keep them out of rhythm because we know what they can do when they get in rhythm.\u201d\n\nOther things to know when Syracuse hosts Western Michigan on Saturday:\n\nBRONCOS RISING\n\nWestern Michigan defeated Georgia State 57-10 last week , netting 694 yards of total offense while the defense allowed just 38 yards in the second half, a good tuneup for the Orange.\n\n\u201cThe opponent that we\u2019re playing, they proved last year they\u2019re capable of scoring points and they can get us into a shootout,\u201d Babers said. \u201cThey\u2019re not afraid of us.\u201d\n\nSTELLAR SPECIAL TEAMS\n\nThe Broncos lead the Mid-American Conference and rank eighth in the country in kickoff return average at 33.78 yards per run-back. Graduate transfer Keith Mixon Jr. leads the way with a 38.28-yard average per return, fifth nationally. He also tops the country with four kickoff returns of 30 or more yards and three of 40 or more yards.\n\nMixon will try to work his magic against the Orange\u2019s Sterling Hofrichter, a tall task. Hofrichter earned national punter of the week honors and was voted ACC specialist of the week after punting a career-high nine times against Clemson for 470 yards. His average of 52.2 yards per kick was the best mark in team history for a player with more than five punts, and six of the kicks traveled at least 50 yards. More importantly, he averaged 51.9 net yards per kick - only two punts were returned for a total of 3 yards.\n\n\u201cHe is so talented that you want to do everything with him because he can, but you need to do less with him because he\u2019s so good,\u201d Babers said. \u201cThis year we\u2019re trying to do less. When we just let him sit back there and be an NFL kicker and punt the football, that\u2019s exactly what he is. He\u2019s an NFL kicker. He\u2019s a weapon in the game.\u201d\n\nSyracuse currently ranks fourth in the FBS in team net punting average (46.8).\n\nRUNNING MAN\n\nWestern Michigan tailback LeVante Bellamy rushed for 192 yards against Georgia State, leading a ground game that finished with 450 yards and a school-record seven TDs. Bellamy, who leads the MAC with 96.3 yards rushing per game, had scoring runs of 60, 36 and 73 yards. His previous high was two touchdowns against Syracuse last season, when he rushed for 120 yards.\n\nFOCUS PLEASE\n\nWhen teams win big like the Broncos did a week ago, the word momentum gets bandied about. It\u2019s not in Bellamy\u2019s football vocabulary.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really believe in momentum. I just feel as if you take every week as its own week,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cYou can be happy about the last game, but you should never dwell on the last game.\n\n\u201cI have another goal I want to achieve, and that\u2019s to beat Syracuse. I feel like if we dwell on Georgia State we\u2019re going to lose to Syracuse, but if we focus on Syracuse and we lock in, then I think it\u2019ll be a great matchup.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There's usually no looking back in football, but for Syracuse a second straight lopsided loss can tend to linger, especially because the opponent was top-ranked Clemson.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Kekis"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/clemson_syracuse_football_19356_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
