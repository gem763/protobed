So, there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cLet them fight their own wars.\u201d\n\nThe split-screen foreign policy moment proved difficult to reconcile and came during perhaps the darkest moment for the modern U.S.-Turkey relationship and a time of trial for Trump and his Republican Party allies. Severe condemnation of Trump\u2019s failure to deter Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s assault on the Kurds, and his subsequent embrace of Turkish talking points about the former U.S. allies, sparked bipartisan outrage in the U.S. and calls for swift punishment for the NATO ally.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats in the House, bitterly divided over the Trump impeachment inquiry, banded together for an overwhelming 354-60 denunciation of the U.S. troop withdrawal. Many lawmakers expressed worry that the withdrawal may lead to revival of IS as well as Russian presence and influence in the area \u2014 in addition to the slaughter of many Kurds.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., publicly broke with Trump to call the U.S. relationship with the Kurds \u201ca great alliance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that we are where we are. I hope the vice president and the secretary of state can somehow repair the damage,\u201d McConnell said Wednesday.\n\nThe White House disclosed that Trump had both cajoled and threatened Erdogan in an unusual letter last week, urging him to act only in \u201cthe right and humane way\u201d in Syria. The letter was sent the same day Erdogan launched the major offensive against the Kurds.\n\nTrump started on a positive note by suggesting they \u201cwork out a good deal,\u201d but then talked about crippling economic sanctions and concluded that the world \u201cwill look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d\n\nTrump did place some sanctions Monday on Turkey for the offensive. But as his emissaries were departing to threaten even tougher actions in the days ahead, Trump appeared to undercut their negotiating stance. He said the U.S. has no business in the region \u2014 and not to worry about the Kurdish fighters.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey goes onto Syria, that\u2019s between Turkey and Syria, it\u2019s not between Turkey and the United States,\u201d Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\nAs he seeks to push Erdogan to agree to a cease-fire, Pence will confront doubts about American credibility and his own, as an emissary of an inconsistent president.\n\n\u201cGiven how erratic President Trump\u2019s decision-making process and style has been, it\u2019s just hard to imagine any country on the receiving end of another interlocutor really being confident that what Pence and Pompeo are delivering reflects Trump\u2019s thinking at the moment or what it will be in the future,\u201d said Jeffrey Prescott, the Obama administration\u2019s senior director for Iran, Iraq, Syria and the Gulf states on the National Security Council and a former deputy national security adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe withdrawal is the worst decision of Trump\u2019s presidency, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who meets often with the president and is one of his strongest and most important supporters in Congress.\n\n\u201cTo those who think the Mideast doesn\u2019t matter to America, remember 9/11 \u2014 we had that same attitude on 9/10/2001,\u201d Graham said\n\nEven before Trump\u2019s comments, Erdogan had publicly stated that he will be undeterred by the sanctions and resisted calls for a cease-fire Wednesday, saying the fighting would end only if Kurdish fighters abandoned their weapons and retreated from positions near the Turkish border. If Pence can persuade Turkey to agree to a cease-fire, which few U.S. officials believed was likely, experts warn it will not erase the signal Trump\u2019s action sent to American allies across the globe or the opening already being exploited by Russia in the region.\n\n\u201cDeterring an action that hasn\u2019t yet been taken is almost always easier than trying to coerce someone to reverse an action that they\u2019ve already committed blood, treasure and honor to,\u201d said John Hannah, former national security adviser for former Vice President Dick Cheney and a senior counselor for Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nIn public appearances, Trump said he was fulfilling a campaign promise to bring U.S. troops home from \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East \u2014 casting aside criticism that a sudden U.S. withdrawal from Syria betrays the Kurdish fighters, stains U.S. credibility around the world and opens an important region to Russia.\n\n\u201cWe have a situation where Turkey is taking land from Syria. Syria\u2019s not happy about it. Let them work it out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey have a problem at a border. It\u2019s not our border. We shouldn\u2019t be losing lives over it.\u201d\n\nAfter the House voted to condemn the withdrawal, congressional leaders of both parties went to the White house for a briefing, which grew contentious, with Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi trading jabs. The Democrats said they walked out when the meeting devolved into an insult-fest.\n\n\u201cWhat we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown,\u201d Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters, saying Trump appeared visibly \u201cshaken up\u201d over the House vote. And Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York criticized Trump for not having an adequate plan to deal with IS fighters who have been held by the Kurds. He said the meeting \u201cwas not a dialogue, this was sort of a diatribe, a nasty diatribe not focused on the facts.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham called Pelosi\u2019s action \u201cbaffling but not surprising.\u201d She said the speaker \u201chad no intention of listening or contributing to an important meeting on national security issues.\u201d\n\nTurkish troops and Turkish-backed Syrian fighters launched their offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria a week ago, two days after Trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the area. Erdogan has said he wants to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d 30 kilometers (20 miles) deep in Syria.\n\nAnkara has long argued the Kurdish fighters are nothing more than an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has waged a guerrilla campaign inside Turkey since the 1980s and which Turkey, as well as the U.S. and European Union, designate as a terrorist organization.\n\nTrump mischaracterized the progress made thus far by the U.S. military in carrying out his instructions to withdraw all 1,000 troops in northeastern Syria. He referred to the approximately two dozen soldiers who evacuated from Turkey\u2019s initial attack zone last week, but cast that as meaning the U.S. has \u201clargely\u201d completed its pullout.\n\nA U.S. official familiar with planning for the withdrawal of the 1,000 said that they are consolidating onto two main bases but have not yet begun flying out of Syria in significant numbers. Military equipment is being gathered and flown out, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the withdrawal, which poses big security risks.\n\nAs U.S. troops pulled back, at least one ammunition cache was destroyed by a U.S. airstrike to prevent its usefulness, as Russian forces took possession of other former American strongholds.\n\n___\n\nBurns reported from Washington.
