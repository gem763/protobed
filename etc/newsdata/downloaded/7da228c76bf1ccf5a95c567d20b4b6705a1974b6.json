On Hong Kong Island, commuters are encouraged to walk from Chater Garden to Sheung Wan via Des Voeux Road Central, or from the Fortress Hill MTR station to Taikoo Place along King\u2019s Road. Those travelling to work or school in Kowloon are asked to walk from the Kowloon Bay MTR station to Kwun Tong along Kwun Tong Road, or from the Star Ferry Pier in Tsim Sha Tsui to Mong Kok along Nathan Road.\n\nWondering what an injunction is, or how bail works?

Their ultimate aim is to mobilise citizens to integrate protests into everyday life.\n\n\u201cIt is a good idea, Hongkongers love going to work and school ... we can bring protests and demonstrations into our daily lives,\u201d one netizen wrote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to do a morning exercise like that,\u201d another netizen wrote. \u201cIf the event is successful, maybe we can extend it to the New Territories next time.\u201d\n\nWhy the movie V for Vendetta has become part of the Hong Kong protests\n\nSome secondary students, who will be going to school around the same time, see the event as a creative and peaceful means of protesting, but they are worried it may lead to serious traffic congestion on the day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not too concerned if the protesters are only using the pedestrian roads, but if there are many of them, then it is very likely that roads will be blocked and it will lead to traffic jams,\u201dsaid Cynthia So, a Form Six student at Creative Secondary School.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if it is an effective way to achieve their demands, but it is definitely effective in grabbing the attention of the media and the public,\u201d the 17-year-old added.\n\nStudents react as Carrie Lam visits Kowloon Mosque and apologises to Muslim community after police water cannon sprays entrance\n\nAnother student said he will set off from home earlier on Friday, in case more travelling time is needed.\n\nMeanwhile, more protests have been planned for this week. Tomorrow night, protesters will form a human chain outside the British Consulate-General Hong Kong, in Admiralty.\n\nPending police approval, a rally will be held in Chater Garden on Thursday night in a show of solidarity with protesters in Catalonia in Spain. The organisers said they are advocating for the human rights and freedom of Catalonians who are battling riot police as they seek the region\u2019s independence from Spain.", "description": "Commuters are being urged to go to school and work by foot as a way to integrate the ongoing anti-government protests into daily life.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/aa76f2ea-f4a3-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6imagehires190223.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
