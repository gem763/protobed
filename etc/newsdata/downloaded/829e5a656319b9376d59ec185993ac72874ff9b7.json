(AP) - One of these NFL franchises is not like the other. At all. On one side, there\u2019s the New England Patriots: Led by Bill Belichick\u2019s defense and Tom Brady at quarterback, they\u2019re the reigning Super Bowl champs and just so happen to be 4-0 this season.\n\nOn the other? The Washington Redskins are 0-4, have a coach, Jay Gruden, that everyone assumes will be gone at the end of this season, if not sooner, and a starting QB spot that\u2019s completely unsettled.\n\nNo wonder New England is favored by about two touchdowns on the road Sunday.\n\nAs of Thursday, no one knew for sure whether it would be Colt McCoy, Dwayne Haskins or Case Keenum taking snaps this weekend.\n\nRedskins running back Chris Thompson made the case that such uncertainty at the sport\u2019s most important position was not a big deal.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not something we think about. We\u2019ve gone through OTAs and training camp. You get used to everybody. There\u2019s not a player in here that hasn\u2019t caught a pass from all three quarterbacks,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cRight now, it doesn\u2019t affect anything. I don\u2019t think it affects the morale of the team, the players, or anything like that.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s certainly possible.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hardly the ideal way to prepare for Sunday\u2019s game against the visiting Patriots and a defense that ranks No. 1 overall in the NFL, No. 2 against the run and No. 2 against the pass, and has allowed a grand total of one TD all season.\n\n\u201cWe just got to keep staying hungry,\u201d said Patriots linebacker Kyle Van Noy, the AFC Defensive Player of the Week after eight tackles, two sacks and two forced fumbles in a 16-10 win at Buffalo.\n\nTheir defense also leads the league with 10 interceptions _ twice as many as any other club _ and has 18 sacks, tied for the league lead.\n\nNew England is allowing 6.8 points per game, the fewest among the 32 teams. Washington, meanwhile, is giving up the second-most, 29.5.\n\n\u201cEverything that they do is different than any other team in the league. They can roll with seven DBs on one play, and then they\u2019ll have five linebackers out there next. You just never know,\u201d Thompson said about New England\u2019s defense. \u201cWith them, it\u2019s never situational. It\u2019s never like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s third-and-5, they\u2019re going to put all their DBs out there.\u2019 They might do it on second down, just for the heck of it. And everything they do, they\u2019re sound and disciplined. It\u2019s a big challenge, for sure. And the fact is, our offense hasn\u2019t been the best, especially the last two weeks.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s certainly true.\n\nWashington puts up 16.5 points per game, keeps handing the ball to the opponent and has neither run nor passed all that effectively. Plays are there to be made, thanks to Gruden\u2019s keen offensive mind, but they\u2019re not always being made.\n\nKeenum had five turnovers in Week 3, then threw a pick before yanked in Week 4; his replacement, first-round draft pick Haskins, threw a trio of interceptions in his NFL debut last week at the New York Giants.\n\nMcCoy hasn\u2019t played since breaking his leg last season. If he\u2019s deemed completely recovered, he might just get his chance to show what he can do in an offense he knows so well.\n\nWhoever is at QB for them this week, the Redskins know full well how difficult things will be.\n\n\u201cWe could sit here and make it about the Patriots, and we would be here all day: Super Bowls; best quarterback of all time; one of the greatest coaches of all time. I really don\u2019t care about any of that,\u201d Washington defensive lineman Jonathan Allen said. \u201cI\u2019m focused on what the Redskins have to do. \u2018Cause if we don\u2019t do what we\u2019ve got to do, it doesn\u2019t matter what they do, \u2018cause we\u2019re not going to win.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to watch:\n\nNEW KICKER\n\nThe Patriots will have someone other than Stephen Gostkowski kicking field goals and extra points for the first time since 2010 after placing the 35-year-old on IR this week and signing Mike Nugent to replace him. Gostkowski is the franchise\u2019s career leading scorer, but he\u2019s already missed four extra points in 2019. \u201cI think sometimes the outside world doesn\u2019t know what he means to our special teams unit and us as a team,\u201d safety Devin McCourty said. \u201cJust the stability at that position; we never waver if there\u2019s a kick on the line.\u201d New England is Nugent\u2019s eighth NFL team.\n\nO-LINE WOES\n\nThe Redskins are still without their best offensive lineman, left tackle Trent Williams, who is holding out, and they have two other starters dealing with injuries: RG Brandon Scherff (ankle) and C Chase Roullier (knee).\n\nTIGHT END HELP?\n\nNew England\u2019s Ben Watson is eligible to make his regular-season debut after serving a four-game suspension for testing positive for a banned substance after last season. He signed a $3 million, one-year deal with the Patriots to help try to fill the hole created by the retirement of Rob Gronkowski. Without Gronk in the lineup, the Patriots are looking for a boost at tight end: Ryan Izzo and Matt LaCosse have four catches for 77 yards with no touchdowns this season.\n\nNO RUNNING GAME\n\nThe Redskins are averaging 17 rushing attempts, the fewest in the NFL, and they rank 31st in average gain per carry, 2.9 yards. Adrian Peterson, who topped 1,000 yards last season, has 90 yards on 33 carries so far this season. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s what the defense is doing. Got to pat those guys on the back,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cAnd sometimes it\u2019s what we aren\u2019t doing right, whether that\u2019s from the running back position or the offensive line.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Kyle Hightower in Foxborough, Mass., contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "One of these NFL franchises is not like the other.
