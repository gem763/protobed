(Sean Gardner/Getty Images)\n\nThe Houston Texans face off against the New Orleans Saints in the first \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d matchup of the 2019 season. Follow along for live updates and analysis.\n\nIn-game updates\n\n4th Quarter\n\nSixth sack for Saints: The Texans supposedly fixed their offensive line, in part with the trade for left tackle Laremy Tunsil, after Deshaun Watson was sacked 62 times last season. But if they did, it\u2019s not evident in their opening game of this season. Watson has been sacked six times by the Saints, including twice on each of the last two Houston possessions. The Saints have the ball back and have the lead, with 3:30 to try to run off the clock. (Saints 24, Texans 21 with 3:29 left in the 4th quarter)\n\nSaints take lead: For the first time all night, the Saints have the lead. They moved in front when Drew Brees threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Tre\u2019Quan Smith on the opening play of the fourth quarter. The Saints have 21 second-half points after managing only three in the first half. They\u2019ve wiped out Texans\u2019 leads of 14-3 and 21-10. (Saints 24, Texans 21 with 14:55 remaining in the 4th quarter)\n\n3rd Quarter\n\nWatson throws interception, Hopkins gets personal foul: The intensity in this game is increasing. Saints safety Marcus Williams intercepted a deep pass thrown into traffic by Deshaun Watson. Houston wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins was given a personal foul for lifting Williams off the ground and body-slamming him to the turf on his tackle of the safety after the interception. (Texans 21, Saints 17 with 1:48 left in the 3rd quarter)\n\nSaints rolling now: The Saints have gotten their offense back into gear, with their second touchdown in their last two possessions. Drew Brees\u2019s first touchdown pass of the season is a nine-yarder to jack-of-all-trades Taysom Hill. (Texans 21, Saints 17 with 2:39 left in the 3rd quarter)\n\nCorroboration that officials erred: Former NFL referee Terry McAulay, now a rules analyst for NBC, concurs that the officials erred with their application of the 10-second clock runoff on the final Saints\u2019 possession of the first half. \u201cSince the play was [reversed] to a first down, the game clock should have been reset to the time on the clock at the end of the play and 10 seconds run off from there,\u201d McAulay wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt appears the runoff occurred from the time the game was stopped for review.\u201d\n\nSince the play was reveresed to a first down, the game clock should have been reset to the time on the clock at the end of the play and 10 seconds run off from there. It appears the runoff occurred from the time the game was stopped for review. #HOUvsNO \u2014 Terry McAulay (@SNFRules) September 10, 2019\n\nTexans have immediate reply: The second Watson-to-Hopkins touchdown of the night has restored the Texans\u2019 lead to 11 points, this time at 21-10. DeAndre Hopkins\u2019s 16-yard touchdown catch came against safety Marcus Williams this time. The Texans\u2019 drive was extended when an offside penalty against the Saints negated an interception by cornerback Marshon Lattimore. (Texans 21, Saints 10 with 8:20 left in the 3rd quarter)\n\nSaints strike back: The Saints didn\u2019t manage a first-half touchdown. But they struck quickly in the third quarter, drawing to within 14-10 on a 30-yard touchdown run by tailback Latavius Murray. (Texans 14, Saints 10 with 12:51 left in the 3rd quarter)\n\nThe first TD of the season for the #Saints!!\n\n\n\n\u25fc\ufe0f The first TD in black and gold for @LataviusM \u25fc\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/5zXua6Xw7d \u2014 New Orleans Saints (@Saints) September 10, 2019\n\nHALFTIME\n\nTexans in command but injury concerns about Watson: Saints fans showed up Monday night at the Superdome to work out their lingering anger about the missed pass interference call in last season\u2019s NFC title game that cost their team a trip to the Super Bowl. Many in the crowd wore black-and-white-striped referee jerseys or carried oversized yellow penalty flags. But, much to their dismay, their frustrations are only mounting. The Texans lead, 14-3, at halftime behind a touchdown run and a touchdown pass by quarterback Deshaun Watson. However, there are injury concerns with Watson, who made two trips to the medical tent on the Texans\u2019 sideline after suffering a hard fall on his back on a leap into the end zone on his 21-yard, fourth-down touchdown scamper. Drew Brees threw a rare red-zone interception and the Saints did not manage a first-half touchdown. Kicker Wil Lutz missed wide left on a 56-yard field goal attempt as time expired in the half, with fans booing loudly about a 10-second runoff of time on the clock on the Saints\u2019 final first-half drive. A replay ruling on a catch by the Saints\u2019 Michael Thomas for a first down necessitated the runoff, under NFL rules. After the runoff, 16 seconds remained in the half. But Mike Pereira, the former NFL officiating czar who is now a rules analyst for Fox, wrote on Twitter that the officials mishandled the replay and should have reset the game clock to 41 seconds before the 10-second runoff to 31 seconds. \u201cUnless I am crazy, Pereira wrote, \u201cthey really mishandled the replay. \u2026 That took 15 seconds away from the Saints.\u201d (Texans 14, Saints 3 at halftime)\n\nUnless I am crazy, they really mishandled the replay. They should have reset the clock to 41 seconds and then run 10 seconds down to 31. That took 15 seconds away from the Saints. \u2014 Mike Pereira (@MikePereira) September 10, 2019\n\nBtw, I am not crazy. \u2014 Mike Pereira (@MikePereira) September 10, 2019\n\n2nd Quarter\n\nTexans extend lead: The Texans have upped their lead to 14-3 with a 16-play touchdown drive that took 7:35 off the clock. Watson\u2019s two-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, who beat Saints cornerback Marshon Lattimore on a third-and-goal slant pattern, capped the long drive. Kenny Stills had his first catch as a member of the Texans on the drive, and a defensive holding penalty on the Saints following a third-down incompletion extended the possession. Watson returned to the medical tent on the Texans\u2019 sideline after the touchdown. (Texans 14, Saints 3 with 1:47 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\nWatson stays in game: Following a relatively lengthy stay in the medical tent on the sideline, Deshaun Watson returned to the field for the start of the Texans\u2019 next offensive series. So he didn\u2019t miss a play after his hard fall on his touchdown run. (Texans 7, Saints 3 with 9:22 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\nSaints reply with field goal: Kicker Wil Lutz\u2019s 32-yard field goal has gotten the Saints on the scoreboard. The Saints have been frustrated on offense so far. They reached the Houston 14-yard line on that drive but settled for the field goal. Brees has connected on 12 of 17 passes for 123 yards. But he threw a costly interception and the Saints are yet to manage a touchdown. (Texans 7, Saints 3 with 9:22 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\n\n\nDrew Brees and the Saints faced the Houston Texans on Monday. (Bill Feig/AP Photo)\n\nWatson gives Texans the lead: Houston took the lead in the opening minute of the second quarter on a 21-yard, fourth-and-inches run by quarterback Deshaun Watson. Watson landed on his back after leaping into the end zone and headed to the medical tent on the Texans\u2019 sideline after the play. Watson\u2019s touchdown capped a 94-yard drive following linebacker Whitney Mercilus\u2019s interception of a Drew Brees pass. Wide receiver Will Fuller\u2019s 54-yard catch got the Texans moving. Coach Bill O\u2019Brien made a failed instant replay challenge of the spot of the football, looking for a first down, before the fourth down. O\u2019Brien called a timeout right before his challenge, then lost another timeout when it failed. No matter. Watson kept the ball and ran around the left side of the Texans\u2019 formation on the fourth-down play, finishing with his leap across the goal line. (Texans 7, Saints 0 with 14:13 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\n1st Quarter\n\nBrees throws pick: A rare mistake by Drew Brees has kept the Saints from taking the lead. They were driving toward a potential go-ahead touchdown when Brees threw an interception to Texans linebacker Whitney Mercilus. Brees was pressured on a second-and-five play from the Houston 11-yard line. He moved to his right and tried to slip a pass to running back Latavius Murray. Instead, the pass went directly to Mercilus for only Brees\u2019s second red-zone interception since the start of the 2017 season. (Saints 0, Texans 0 with 2:55 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nWatson under pressure: The Texans allowed Deshaun Watson to be sacked 62 times last season. That\u2019s one of the big reasons they were willing to surrender such a king\u2019s ransom of draft choices to the Miami Dolphins in the trade for left tackle Laremy Tunsil. But two offensive possessions into the new season, Watson remains under siege. He has been sacked twice by the Saints, and the Texans have punted twice. The Saints have the ball for the second time after punting to end their opening drive when Coach Sean Payton opted against a fourth-and-two gamble from the Houston 45-yard line. (Saints 0, Texans 0 with 7:15 left in 1st quarter)\n\nSaints win replay challenge: It wasn\u2019t instant replay for a pass interference non-call, but Coach Sean Payton and the Saints did win a replay challenge on the Texans\u2019 opening possession. The Saints challenged the on-field call of a legal catch for the Texans\u2019 DeAndre Hopkins, and the call was overturned on review and called an incompletion. The Saints went on to get a third-down sack of Houston quarterback Deshaun Watson and force a punt. (Saints 0, Texans 0 with 13:31 left in 1st quarter)\n\nTexans at Saints\n\nWhen: Monday at 7:10 p.m. Eastern\n\nWhere: Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans\n\nTV: ESPN\n\nStreaming: ESPN+, fuboTV\n\nPregame reading\n\nThe latest attempt by quarterback Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints to get back to a Super Bowl begins Monday night when they host the Houston Texans in their season-opening game.\n\nThe Saints-Texans matchup is part of a \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d doubleheader that concludes with the Denver Broncos playing at Oakland, as the Raiders begin their second season with Jon Gruden as their coach and try to recover from the Antonio Brown debacle.\n\nThe Saints return to the scene of the officiating debacle in last season\u2019s NFC championship game in New Orleans that helped cost them a spot in the Super Bowl. That infamous non-call sent the Los Angeles Rams, not the Saints, to last season\u2019s Super Bowl and led to the NFL\u2019s offseason rule change that made pass interference calls and non-calls reviewable by instant replay.\n\n[How the NFL\u2019s pass interference instant replay rule will work in 2019]\n\nSaints Coach Sean Payton was a strong advocate for the replay modification. But it didn\u2019t fix what happened in the NFC title game, and it didn\u2019t mollify many Saints fans who were so outraged by the blunder.\n\nThe previous two Saints seasons have ended in postseason heartbreak, beginning with the miraculous last-second touchdown by the Minnesota Vikings that eliminated New Orleans from the playoffs and ended its 2017 season. The Super Bowl opportunities are dwindling for the 40-year-old Brees as he and Payton attempt to recreate the magic from the Saints\u2019 championship season in 2009.\n\nThe supporting cast around Brees remains strong, led by running back Alvin Kamara and wide receiver Michael Thomas. The Saints made Thomas the NFL\u2019s highest-paid wide receiver with a contract extension worth close to $20 million per season. But that deal was surpassed Saturday by the extension, worth $22 million a year, that Julio Jones completed with the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nThe Texans begin their season on the heels of the much-debated recent roster retooling overseen by Coach Bill O\u2019Brien. The team has been operating without a general manager, giving increased authority over the roster to O\u2019Brien. And many believed that the Texans didn\u2019t get enough in the trade that sent defensive end Jadeveon Clowney to the Seattle Seahawks while surrendering too much in the deal that brought left tackle Laremy Tunsil and wide receiver Kenny Stills from the Miami Dolphins.\n\nWhatever the compensation, the trade with the Dolphins should benefit the Texans in the short term. Tunsil should provide capable blind-side protection for quarterback Deshaun Watson, who was sacked 62 times last season. Stills gives Watson a pass-catching complement to top wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins. The defense must prove, though, that the loss of Clowney won\u2019t be overly harmful.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Patriots looked unbeatable against the Steelers.
