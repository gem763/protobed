We were hesitant and were not willing... He told us that Arti Dhir from London wants to adopt a boy and for that they had placed advertisements in the newspapers but couldn\u2019t get any one.\n\nIn a village near Malia, in the Gujarat region of India, Mrs Kardani yesterday told how she brought Gopal up as her own son after their father died and their mother abandoned them\n\n\u2018He said that since you people are poor, it is better that Gopal goes. If your boy [Gopal] moves to the UK, it would be nice for you and him.\n\n\u2018We didn\u2019t expect any money or monetary benefits from them. All we expected was that Gopal gets a good life. We are poor and do labour work to survive daily ordeals.\u2019\n\nIn February 2017, Gopal and Mr Kardani had been to sign some of the paperwork when they were ambushed.\n\nA motorbike carrying two men pulled up alongside the car, where one said: \u2018Let us kidnap the boy and we may find something of value,\u2019 according to court documents.\n\nGopal was dragged from the car before being stabbed in the stomach. Mr Kardani was killed trying to save him.\n\nDhir and Raijada, of Hanwell, west London, are currently fighting extradition requests from India to face trial in the country.\n\nThey each face six charges including conspiracy to murder and kidnapping. The pair deny the allegations and have not been charged in the UK.\n\nIn July, they won their latest attempt to remain in Britain after a judge ruled that, if convicted of two murders in India, the couple would face life sentences without the prospect of parole \u2013 breaching their human rights.\n\nGopal, pictured right, was dragged from the car before being stabbed in the stomach. Mr Kardani, left, was killed trying to save him\n\nSitting at Westminster magistrates\u2019 court, senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot found that Gopal was \u2018unaccountably\u2019 targeted by the murderers.\n\nBut, in rejecting India\u2019s extradition request, Mrs Arbuthnot said the possible sentence faced by the suspect would be \u2018inhuman and degrading\u2019.\n\nReacting to the decision, Mrs Kardani said: \u2018The UK Government must send them back to Gujarat, India. We have lost two lives. How do we go on in life? They must be brought to justice... I took care of Gopal since he was in cradle and he was two years old. Gopal was just like my own son. The Gujarat police have done a good job... The UK Government should look at poor people like us and I hope [they] understand what we are going through.\u2019\n\nCourt documents allege that Kenyan-born Dhir, who arrived in the UK as a child, paid two insurance premiums totalling \u00a330,000 into a \u2018wealth builder\u2019 policy before he died in 2017. She is pictured leaving a west London gym with her face covered\n\nYesterday Dhir and Raijada made every effort to maintain a low profile as they emerged separately from their flat with their faces covered by scarves.\n\nThe couple were first arrested in London in June 2017 shortly after Dhir was named by Interpol as one of Britain\u2019s \u2018most wanted\u2019.\n\nA first extradition hearing took place in January, with further hearings in June and July.\n\nThe Indian government has appealed the decision not to grant extradition and a further hearing is set for January.\n\nSupt Saurab Singh of Junagadh Police in Gujarat said: \u2018Dhir and Raijada are accused of a criminal conspiracy to kidnap a young boy of 11 years.\u2019\n\nHe said the allegation was they had \u2018taken an insurance policy in his name, kidnapped him and got him murdered\u2019.\n\nFour men have been arrested in India for their alleged involvement.", "description": "Former Heathrow baggage handler Arti Dhir, 55, is accused of arranging the killing of 11-year-old Gopal Sejani to claim up to \u00a3150,000 through a life insurance policy.", "authors": ["Glen Keogh", "Hanif Khokhar In Malia", "India", "For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/20/19900792-0-image-a-7_1571427653860.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
