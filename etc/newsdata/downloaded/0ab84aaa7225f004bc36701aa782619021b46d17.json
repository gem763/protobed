A recent survey of 1,002 adults by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) found that 52% plan to get a flu shot this season.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Thursday described influenza as a serious, potentially deadly illness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more than just a couple missed days of work because of fever, body aches and just feeling lousy in general,\u201d Mr. Azar said at a forum at the National Press Club. \u201cEach year, seasonal flu sickens millions of Americans, hospitalizes hundreds of thousands and kills tens of thousands.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2018-2019 flu season, which lasted a record-setting 21 weeks, the CDC reported between 37 million to 43 million illnesses, 531,000 to 647,000 hospitalizations and 36,400 to 61,200 deaths in the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump last week signed an executive order to modernize flu vaccines and improve their effectiveness and manufacturing. About 85% of manufacturers today develop vaccines by growing them in eggs, which takes months, said Dr. Dan Jernigan, director of the CDC\u2019s influenza division.\n\nFlu vaccine effectiveness rates average around 40%. Last season, the vaccine proved 29% effective, dropping from 47% in February when a group of H3N2 viruses unexpectedly rose to prominence.\n\n\u201cThis particular virus is particularly terrible at quality control. It makes lots of different copies of itself,\u201d Dr. Jernigan said. \u201cThe fact it is going through so much error as it\u2019s making copies of itself it gives itself this advantage of being able to find a way around our own immunity.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NFID survey, the top reasons U.S. adults gave for not planning to get a flu shot: They thought flu vaccines do not work (51%), they were concerned about side effects (34%) and they were worried about getting the flu from the vaccine (22%).\n\nWhile the vaccine could use improvements, it still provides vast protection, said Dr. William Schaffner, NFID medical director, noting that it can lessen a person\u2019s chance of suffering complications and shorten and alleviate influenza illnesses.\n\n\u201cThe flu is unpredictable, but we can predict it will rise,\u201d said Dr. Schaffner. \u201cIt needs to be taken seriously. Vaccination is clearly the best prevention.\u201d\n\nIt is recommended that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot before the end of October. The shot also can be given simultaneously with the vaccine for pneumococcal pneumonia, a possible complication of the flu.\n\nOther complications include heart, brain or muscle tissue inflammation and multi-organ failure. Young children, adults 65 years and older and pregnant women are at greater risk of developing flu complications.\n\nDr. Patricia Whitley-Williams, a pediatrician and professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, spoke at Thursday\u2019s forum. She said she has seen high rates of hospitalization of young children due to the flu and some who even died from complications.\n\n\u201cWe know that the flu vaccine isn\u2019t perfect. We all know it won\u2019t provide 100% protection, but it will reduce the severity and duration of disease. And it will save children\u2019s lives,\u201d Dr. Whitley-Williams said. \u201cSo everyone, please get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nPeople with chronic health conditions also face an increased risk of developing flu complications. About 93% of adults hospitalized for flu-related complications last season had an underlying medical condition, said Dr. William Borden, preventative cardiologist and professor at George Washington University.\n\nInfluenza can worsen chronic medical problems such as asthma and heart disease.\n\nThis season, the public has a number of vaccine options \u2014 from the standard shot to a nasal spray.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
