I had to admit the damage and face it | Rachael Denhollander", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta deal with this, honey,\u201d my mom told me. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep burying it. It will destroy you.\u201d\n\nWhenever she suggested I see a counselor, I would absolutely refuse. I was not going to talk about it, and I hung on to any shred of control and choice I had. No one will ever know. (I don\u2019t recommend survivors follow my stubborn example!)\n\nSince I wouldn\u2019t see a counselor, Mom searched for other options that would enable me to begin processing my feelings. \u201cWhat about journaling?\u201d she asked me. \u201cNo one will see it \u2013 just you. Start putting words to everything so it isn\u2019t all bottled up any more.\u201d\n\nI spent the next few months wrestling with myself, with God, and with everyone else. I knew what I needed to do. I couldn\u2019t choose what had happened, but I could choose how I responded. I knew what choices I needed to make, and I wanted \u2013 more than anything \u2013 to make them. I wanted to be done with the fear and shame. I wanted to be done with the grief. I wanted to feel whole again.\n\nOne night, I journaled the choices I could \u00admake \u2013 the choices I wanted to make:\n\nI choose to give it up.\n\nI choose to let go.\n\nI choose to live with the consequences of what Larry Nassar did.\n\nI knew that pretending those consequences weren\u2019t there wasn\u2019t working. I had to admit the damage and face it \u2013 not bury it any more.\n\nI choose to not need an apology from him.\n\nI choose to not hope he remembers sorrowfully what he did.\n\nMy healing couldn\u2019t be dependent on Larry. I had to face, admit, and hold fast to the truth, no matter what he chose to do. I couldn\u2019t make choices for him, but I could make choices for me.\n\nI choose to trust God\u2019s justice instead of wanting to deal with Larry myself.\n\nI knew I\u2019d take the first chance I got to stop Larry from hurting others, but I also knew I could no longer live obsessing about getting justice. The chances of ever seeing it were slim to none. If my healing was conditional on getting a verdict or jail time, I would never be able to heal.\n\nI choose to leave it in God\u2019s hands instead of wishing I could make Larry see what he took.\n\nI couldn\u2019t make Larry comprehend the damage he\u2019d done. I couldn\u2019t make him feel grief about it. But the truth wasn\u2019t dependent on what Larry thought or felt, and I had to remember that.\n\nI choose to forgive.\n\nI choose to want Larry\u2019s repentance and salvation because it is what he needs, not what I want.\n\nI closed the folder I\u2019d stashed my loose\u00adleaf journal in.\n\nI felt better.\n\nI\u2019d handled it.\n\nI was fine. Two days later, I realized \u2026 it wasn\u2019t that easy.\n\nLetting the memories out, even a little, unleashed a torrent of anger and self\u00adprotection. All the lies I\u2019d fought to bury for years screamed in my head more loudly than I thought possible. Your fault! You didn\u2019t fight back! Who is so stupid they don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening? You didn\u2019t protect yourself because you didn\u2019t care enough! Your fault!\n\nI was angry. Did God care? Did anyone care? I viewed my parents\u2019 concern as too biased to be reliable. Of course they cared \u2013 just as every parent thinks their newborn is the most beautiful baby ever. I was indescribably thankful my parents were on my side, but I couldn\u2019t let myself trust their assessment.\n\nI angrily scrawled another journal entry.\n\nIs value lost when something is stolen from it?\n\nI thought back to a week during my high school Sunday school class when a substitute teacher chose to teach on the story of David and Bathsheba, a narrative in which the ancient Israelite king David summons a young woman he sees bathing on her rooftop and then sleeps with her. The story gets even darker when David has her husband killed to cover up the resulting pregnancy.\n\n\u201cSo what do y\u2019all think about Bathsheba?\u201d the teacher asked casually. \u201cDoes she bear any responsibility for this?\u201d\n\nI flinched. Oh no \u2026 please don\u2019t go there.\n\nJust then, a female classmate spoke up, pointing out that David, as the king, held Bathsheba\u2019s life in his hands, and therefore, she couldn\u2019t have said no.\n\nThank you, I sighed, amazed she\u2019d had the courage to say something. I wouldn\u2019t have touched that one with a ten-foot pole. Not at that point, anyway. I was too afraid I\u2019d break down if I tried. But my relief quickly dissipated when one of the only guys in the class whom I respected jumped into the discussion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d he offered calmly. \u201cShe could have chosen death. This wasn\u2019t abuse.\u201d\n\nAnger welled up inside me, and I held my breath to keep it from bursting forth. This wasn\u2019t abuse? He held her life in his hands but it\u2019s her fault? There was no way I was going to speak up. I wouldn\u2019t be able to without someone figuring out why it mattered so much. But the anger quickly gave way to grief as the discussion continued to swirl around me.\n\n\u201cMm hmm.\u201d The teacher nodded casually.\n\nHe agrees. I wanted to get up and leave. This wasn\u2019t just about me. I knew there was at least one rape victim sitting in that class too, and statistically, many more survivors. What if she couldn\u2019t fight back either? Does she know it\u2019s not her fault? What have we just communicated to these girls? I knew they would feel guilt for their abuse \u2013 and the sting of those words, untrue though they were, could be devastating \u2013 especially if they lacked the family support that I was fortunate enough to have.\n\nI glanced over at my male friend. I knew his interpretation was wrong. That wasn\u2019t even how the Bible told the story. Later on \u2013 in the part the teacher hadn\u2019t bothered to address and apparently no one remembered \u2013 David is confronted with the evil he\u2019s done in the form of an allegory. In the story, David is portrayed as a self-centered, powerful, rich man who stole and killed an innocent lamb (Bathsheba). Far from being assigned blame, she is referred to tenderly as an innocent who has been violated.\n\nI knew from past experience that false ideas about abuse had a stronghold in the church, where wrong ideas often had a veneer of piety put over them and were adhered to both out of ignorance and firm conviction.\n\nIf they see Bathsheba that way, they would see me that way too \u2013 better off dead than violated.\n\nChurch wasn\u2019t safe. Nowhere was safe.\n\nBy the time spring rolled around, things were a bit better. Getting my thoughts down on paper had at least helped identify some of the damage. I was feeling a little less tense and fearful. I didn\u2019t have any answers yet, and I hadn\u2019t really moved beyond the questions, but at least I was asking them, after refusing to for so long.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be better now, right?\n\nWrong.", "description": "In a new book extract, Rachael Denhollander describes the grief, fear and shame she felt \u2013 and how she fought to heal", "authors": ["Rachael Denhollander"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62833ddadc7eefd868859635c0e5173e61d65128/0_158_2096_1258/master/2096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4becda89bafc938cb43d98adb9c09b2f", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
