It\u2019s less than the roughly 200,000 per month we\u2019ve tended to average for the last several years, and it\u2019s especially disappointing in light of decennial Census hiring that likely added 25,000 jobs that should have been gravy on top of normal job growth.\n\nOn the other hand, the report had good news: It showed that wage growth had sped up and beat expectations. Average hourly earnings grew 0.4 percent in August and 3.2 percent over the last year. And unemployment remained very low, at 3.7 percent.\n\nAs with so many economic reports lately, there\u2019s something here for everyone.\n\nFor another example, the ISM manufacturing index fell below 50 for August, suggesting the U.S. manufacturing sector is shrinking. That figure was even worse than analysts had expected, and suggests the trade war is discouraging U.S. firms from investing and growing. But ISM\u2019s service-sector survey showed increasing strength in August.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note: While rising wages with slowing job growth is a mixed story for workers, it\u2019s a concerning one for stockholders, as it means both less business expansion and rising labor costs that reduce profit margins. And if strong wage growth persists, the Federal Reserve might decide it\u2019s not having so much trouble hitting its inflation target anymore, therefore it\u2019s done with its \u201cmid-cycle adjustment\u201d series of rate cuts. A shift to tighter interest-rate policy might, in turn, lead to a cooling in wage growth.\n\nBut that\u2019s getting ahead of ourselves. So far, these shifts aren\u2019t big enough to mean big changes to either the economic outlook or the outlook for future Federal Reserve rate decisions. The Fed remains highly likely to cut interest rates when it meets in two weeks, but only by another quarter point.\n\nThe markets\u2019 rebound this week was mainly driven not by economic data but by good public-policy news, in the form of signs of thawing in the U.S.\u2013China trade relationship. This rebound was consistent with the optimistic theory of the trade war: that it would harm specific sectors of the U.S. economy, but its effects would not be so large as to greatly impair consumer spending or drag down the whole economy.\n\nThe open question is whether that optimistic outlook can be maintained until and through the planned early-October meetings between U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators. Prior thaws have been temporary; if this one also proves temporary, so should the stock market rally.", "description": "In the latest economic data \u2013 including Friday\u2019s jobs numbers \u2013 there\u2019s fodder for the optimists and the pessimists alike.", "authors": ["Josh Barro"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/09/01/01-economy-hiring.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
