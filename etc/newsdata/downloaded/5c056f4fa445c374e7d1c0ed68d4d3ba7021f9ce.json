She actually has less of them now than she did at the beginning,\u201d said Young, 38. \u201cAt the beginning, it really was Rice Krispies Treats, and it was to the point where \u2013 she's going to get so mad I'm even saying this, but it's true \u2013 she would just make them in the pot and then not even move them over to the pan to flatten them out. She would just spoon them out of the pot \u2013 like straight up. Like, 'The marshmallows and the butter have melted, I'm going to eat it right now.'\u201d\n\nCOUNTRY MUSIC STAR BRETT YOUNG ANNOUNCES WIFE'S PREGNANCY: 'AND THEN WE WERE 3'\n\n\u201cI was cracking up. She wasn't even showing yet and she just needed the Rice Krispies Treats,\u201d he said. \u201cI made a joke the other day \u2013 she's 23 almost 24-weeks pregnant now and we were in the airport lounge and I was like, 'Babe, there's Rice Krispies Treats squares,' and she was like, 'Oh put them in a cup for me,' and I put a bunch in a cup and she took one bite and she was like, 'Oh no \u2013 these are the kind from the package, they just chop them up.'\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I'm like, 'Are you a Rice Krispies Treats snob? What is happening here?\u201d Young quipped.\n\nYoung said at the time that he was prepared to bring baby Presley along for the ride when he goes on tour and even said his tour bus now comes equipped with a nursery.\n\nCOUNTRY STAR BRETT YOUNG WAS 'BUILT' FOR TOURING AND SUCCESS\n\n\u201cWe do have a new home that is not \u2013 and maybe the way I'm feeling right now will never be done being furnished, but you know, I think as much as a woman goes to the nesting phase, I kind of am to and so I love being on the road, and once I get out there again I'm always excited to be there,\u201d said Young.\n\nThe singer-songwriter with five No. 1 singles to his credit recalled advise he received from fellow country star Dierks Bentley about the secret to balancing parenthood with life on the road.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"He said, \u2018That's the trick \u2013 you don't and you have to be OK with that,\u2019\u201d Young recollected.\n\n\u201cAnd I think I kind of finally just accepted that you don't, and it's that right partner in your life that knows that you can't and is OK with it. And so, I'm still running as much as I can but also trying to make as much time my wife, my soon to be baby as I can. Life is still beautiful the diet is still difficult, but always blessed nonetheless.\u201d", "description": "Country music staple Brett Young and his wife, Taylor Mills, ushered in new titles on Monday when they welcomed their first child together.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/Brett-Young-Wife-CMA-Awards.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
