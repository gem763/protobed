We were so excited to have this dignified person in the White House. My first election was voting for him when he made it into office and then voting to re-elect him. I think a lot of people are like me, where they just didn\u2019t really know that this could happen.\u201d\n\nMs. Swift then said that helping Democrats as the presidential election season heats up is a top priority.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just focused on the 2020 election. I\u2019m really focused on it. I\u2019m really focused on how I can help and not hinder. Because I also don\u2019t want it to backfire again, because I do feel that the celebrity involvement with Hillary\u2019s campaign was used against her in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nThe entertainer also expressed frustration at strict litmus tests for Democrats before receiving the support of their peers.\n\n\u201cI do think, as a party, we need to be more of a team. With Republicans, if you\u2019re wearing that red hat, you\u2019re one of them. And if we\u2019re going to do anything to change what\u2019s happening, we need to stick together. We need to stop dissecting why someone\u2019s on our side or if they\u2019re on our side in the right way or if they phrased it correctly. We need to not have the right kind of Democrat and the wrong kind of Democrat. We need to just be like, \u2018You\u2019re a Democrat? Sick. Get in the car. We\u2019re going to the mall.\u2019\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
