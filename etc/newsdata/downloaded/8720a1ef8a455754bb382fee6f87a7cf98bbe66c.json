Col. Alexander Vindman is the first current White House official to testify in the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\nTrump supporters have attacked Vindman, a Ukraine-born American citizen, which is \"reprehensible,\" according to a former Army general under whom Vindman served.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nA top adviser to President Donald Trump on Ukraine testified on Tuesday that he was so alarmed after hearing Trump ask Ukraine's president to investigate a political rival, Democrat Joe Biden, that he reported the matter to a White House lawyer out of concern for US national security.\n\nArmy Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, director of European affairs on the National Security Council, arrived at the US Capitol clad in his military dress uniform as he became the first current White House official to testify in the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\nVindman, a Ukraine-born American citizen and decorated Iraq War combat veteran, also became the first person to testify who listened in on the July 25 call at the heart of the Ukraine scandal.\n\nEven before his arrival, some allies of the Republican president, including Fox News host Laura Ingraham, sought to attack Vindman's integrity and questioned his loyalty to the United States.\n\nBiden defended Vindman as a hero, calling attacks on the Army officer's character and loyalty \"despicable.\"\n\n\"He's a hell of a patriot,\" the former vice president told MSNBC.\n\nOn Fox, they accused Vindman of espionage. Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney wasn't having it.\n\nWhen Vindman worked in Moscow for the US government, he served under Gen. Peter Zwack, who told The World's Carol Hills that he's deeply troubled by what he calls innuendo and slander directed at Lt. Col. Vindman.\n\n\"We worked together in an immensely sensitive time, where we all had to trust each other,\" Zwack said. \"I trusted him with my life then. I would now, and I find preposterous the innuendo that he somehow is a double agent. That was just fear and hate-mongering and I found it reprehensible. And I think it offended me enormously, including, I think a lot of other what you would call fair-minded people, especially that have known Alex as long as we have and have seen him serve our country so well and dedicatedly.\"", "description": "Army Lt.
