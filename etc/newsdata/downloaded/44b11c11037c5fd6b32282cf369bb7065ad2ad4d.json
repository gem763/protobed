His approval\u2019s already taken a hit from the impeachment process. There are damaging revelations about the Ukraine process dribbling out every day. The last thing he needs while the public is mulling the prospect of ending his presidency early is to hit them with another unpopular shutdown. It\u2019d be the height of foolishness, completely self-destructive, the sort of thing aimed at appealing to the 25 percent of the country that makes up his hardcore base (\u201cHe fights!\u201d) while alienating everyone else. He\u2019d damage himself for no better reason than to gratify a primal impulse towards revenge.\n\nSo \u2026 yeah, now that I think about it, it does seem like something he might do.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t sound like something Mitch McConnell would do, which is why it won\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m increasingly worried that President Trump will want to shut down the government again because of impeachment,\u201d Schumer told reporters. \u201cHe always likes to create diversions. I hope and pray he won\u2019t want to cause another government shutdown because it might be a diversion away from impeachment.\u201d Republicans have insisted the government will not shut down, but that was also their position in December when Trump kicked off the longest government shutdown in history over Democrats\u2019 refusal to fund his border wall. Without action, the government will shut down Nov. 22.\n\nThis is a leverage play, obviously. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate are at a momentary stalemate on the defense bill, with Jim Inhofe\u2019s committee preparing a \u201cskinny\u201d stopgap version to keep the lights on in case the two sides can\u2019t reach a deal on a comprehensive bill by the time the Pentagon runs out of money on November 21. Schumer has two options on how to spin that. The boring one: \u201cWe can\u2019t agree on every particular about defense spending.\u201d The exciting one: \u201cThe president is once again abusing his power by choking off funds in order to derail his own impeachment!\u201d Which option would you choose?\n\nSchumer knows how worried McConnell is about Senate Republicans being saddled with Trump\u2019s political baggage next fall so he\u2019s trying to pile more onto them: If Senate Republicans let the government shut down again, it\u2019s Trump\u2019s fault. Maybe he\u2019ll squeeze a few extra concessions out of Cocaine Mitch in the interest of avoiding that narrative. And in fairness, there *is* always a chance that Trump will be talked into a self-sabotaging show of resolve by his Fox News buddies in which he decides to shut down the government to protest the \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d But it wouldn\u2019t work \u2014 I think. McConnell went along with a Trump-led shutdown fight once before. He\u2019s not going to let POTUS screw Collins, Gardner, and the other vulnerable incumbents again, a year out from an election, by going along with another one. I suspect he\u2019d deliver the 20 Republican votes Schumer would need for a veto-proof majority on a spending bill. (Whether Kevin McCarthy could get Pelosi to two-thirds of the House is a separate question.)\n\nIn fact, McConnell might even secretly welcome a chance to defy Trump in a big spot. He knows his caucus will need to take a tough vote soon to acquit the president after his impeachment trial in the Senate. Purple-staters like Collins and Gardner will be pilloried by Democrats as Trump stooges when that happens. So if McConnell can hand them an opportunity to cross Trump on another big vote, presumably he\u2019ll lunge at it. Especially when that vote involves something as potentially unpopular as a new shutdown.\n\nPurely as a thought experiment, it\u2019s fascinating to imagine how the public might react to a double whammy in which Washington has to interrupt being bitterly divided over something as momentous as impeachment in order to be bitterly divided over a new shutdown. It\u2019s a fact of life in modern America that Washington is broken but I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve experienced anything in the past 20 years that would drive home how badly broken it is as vividly as that would. One wonders what it might do to the Democratic presidential process. Would radicals like Bernie and Warren gain momentum from it, in the belief that we need to \u201cshake up the system\u201d even more dramatically than we did in electing Trump? Or would it cut the other way, with Biden getting a boost in the belief that we desperately need a return to comity and \u201cnormalcy\u201d and that\u2019s what Grandpa Joe represents?\n\nAnyway, since you\u2019re doubtless wondering, yes, House Democrats would be able to continue working on impeachment if the government shut down. Per Roll Call, members of Congress continue to get paid thanks to Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution; staff are a different matter, but Congress could continue to keep some around as \u201cessential\u201d employees since impeachment is, after all, a constitutional power. The hearings would likely go forward.", "description": "\"He always likes to create diversions.\u201d", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/s-7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
