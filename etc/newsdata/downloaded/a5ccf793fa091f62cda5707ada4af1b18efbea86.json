Soon he will appear as the late Fox News founder Roger Ailes in the upcoming film Bombshell. But on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Tuesday night, he debuted his Rudy Giuliani. And it was something to behold.\n\nAfter Colbert played a montage of the real Giuliani \u201cdoing damage control, minus the control\u201d on cable news and gave a breakdown of just how bad things have been going for the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Lithgow appeared \u201cvia satellite\u201d in full-on Rudy makeup to tell his side of the story.\n\nBefore the host could get out a question, Giuliani started shushing him. \u201cMr. Mayor, how do you respond to critics who say that you were traveling the world pushing debunked conspiracies as part of a scheme to help the president\u2019s re-election?\u201d Colbert asked when he could finally get a word in.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, Stephen!\u201d Giuliani replied. \u201cI was simply bringing the American people the truth about the Bidens! And that\u2019s not all. I now have reason to believe that the 2016 election was not hacked by the Russians, it was hacked by Hunter Biden, who is actually a Men in Black-style alien, being operated by a tiny Hillary Clinton in his neck.\u201d Asked if he has \u201cproof\u201d for that claim, he added, \u201cNot yet! Or ever. I\u2019m not falling into the proof trap!\u201d\n\nAs the interview progressed, Giuliani started to chug red wine on camera as he defended himself against accusations from former National Security Adviser John Bolton that he was like a \u201chand grenade\u201d that would blow up the whole administration. \u201cStephen, that\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cGrenades are used by highly-trained soldiers. I\u2019m more like a can of hairspray someone turns into a flamethrower during a prison riot. That\u2019s also what happened to my teeth.\u201d\n\nFrom there, he began listing off all of the players in his conspiracy theories: \u201cThe deep state, Podesta, George Soros.\u201d Before taking another sip of wine, he said, \u201cLet me consult my research department\u201d and added, \u201cThe lizard people, Bigfoot, the Chupacabra.\u201d\n\nFinally, Giuliani announced his \u201ccounter-counter\u201d investigation into the counterintelligence probe into him. \u201cI\u2019ve teamed with a new Bulgarian company, \u2018Certified Rip-Off,\u2019\u201d he revealed. \u201cThey\u2019re going to fund my space expedition to get to the bottom of Hunter Biden\u2019s business deal with the Nazis in the center of the moon!\u201d", "description": "The Emmy and Tony-winning actor is giving SNL\u2019s Kate McKinnon a run for her money.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2558,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571805774/116038_0133_u1vtcm", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
