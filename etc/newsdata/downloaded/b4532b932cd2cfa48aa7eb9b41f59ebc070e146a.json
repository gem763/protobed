He will be assisted by a law professor and a retired forensics expert. The inquiry will last nine months.\n\nMr Muscat has also offered a \u20ac1m ($1.1m; \u00a3880,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of those behind her killing.\n\nThree men have been under arrest since 2017 and are due to stand trial for the murder, although the police investigation into who ordered the killing and why is continuing.\n\nDuring pre-trial proceedings, brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio and their friend Vincent Muscat pleaded not guilty.", "description": "The country has so far failed to identify those behind Daphne Caruana Galizia's killing in 2017.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12245/production/_108890347_mediaitem108890346.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
