Giuliani, the former New York mayor, is Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nAll the other defendants in the case were already in custody.\n\nProsecutors said Correia, who owns a home with his wife in West Palm Beach, was part of efforts by co-defendants Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman to leverage outsized political donations to Republican candidates and committees as part of an effort to advance their business interests.\n\nBoth Parnas and Fruman have a history of business dealings with Giuliani.\n\nProsecutors said that, among other things, the pair made campaign contributions with the intent of lobbying US politicians to oust the country\u2019s ambassador to Ukraine. At the time, Giuliani was trying to get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Trump\u2019s potential Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.\n\nCorreia is accused of conspired with the other defendants, including Ukrainian-born US citizen Andrey Kukushkin, to make political donations to local and federal politicians in New York, Nevada and other states with the aim of trying to get support for a new recreational marijuana business.\n\nAll four defendants were expected to appear on Thursday in federal court in Manhattan.\n\nSeparately, the investigation into Giuliani\u2019s Ukrainian business dealings are reported to have triggered a broader set of counterintelligence concerns within the FBI than previously known, CNN has reported.\n\nKenneth McCallion, a New York lawyer who has represented several Ukrainian clients including former Ukraine prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, has said counterintelligence agents approached him asking about Giuliani\u2019s ties to Parnas and Fruman earlier this year.\n\nThe investigation is understood to focus on possible foreign influence operations designed to take advantage of Giuliani\u2019s Ukrainian ties to make inroads with the White House.\n\n\u201cI was just asked whether I or any of my clients knew of any dealings that these two guys had with Giuliani,\u201d McCallion told the network. \u201cThey were on the radar with regard to possible counterintelligence issues.\n\nMcCallion added that he \u201cwas asked a lot of questions by FBI and other counterintelligence investigators who were looking at Giuliani\u2019s comings and goings in Ukraine and business dealings\u201d.\n\nGiuliani, who has said Parnas and Fruman are his clients, has said he had \u201cno such knowledge\u201d of a federal inquiry involving him.\n\nCorreia, the fourth man arrested in the investigation, is listed as the registered agent for a Florida corporation tied to a series of wire transfers prosecutors allege was part of an elaborate effort to hide the true source of funds used to make the donations.\n\nHe posed with then congressman Pete Sessions in a 2018 photo taken inside the Texas Republican\u2019s Capitol Hill office that Parnas posted on social media with the caption \u201cHard at work !!\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press reported last week that Sessions fits the description in the indictment of a congressman who prosecutors allege was part of a coordinated effort to remove the US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nThe arrest comes as a former top aide to secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told impeachment investigators on Wednesday that he resigned because he was upset that the Trump administration had overridden Ukraine policy.\n\nAccording to three sources who briefed the New York Times on House intelligence committee depositions, the aide, Michael McKinley, described his frustration with the politicization of the department under President Trump.\n\nMcKinley is the latest in a string of diplomats and officials who have described to impeachment investigators that they pushed aside as Trump exercised his own agenda on Ukraine, including efforts to have former vice-president Joe Biden and his son investigated.", "description": "Prosecutors allege David Correia, 44, made political donations to Republican candidates to advance business interests", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722323a17b6606cd0dc48cfc7ab752e67120392d/3_78_948_569/master/948.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b668ad06afd75cd96d0f5c620c1298dc", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
