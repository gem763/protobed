It left her feeling very angry at the world, but we\u2019ve had a lot of support.\u2019\n\nIt is hoped that Quinn will one day not need the wheelchair but she can currently only walk 10 to 15 steps at a time.\n\nPolice are treating the attack last month as a disability hate crime.\n\nPC Terasa Holden said: \u2018No-one should worry about leaving home and facing abuse, particularly a little girl who is in too much pain to walk to school because of a rare medical condition.\n\n\u2018My colleagues and I have worked to support Quinn and her family and hope other people will come forward and report this kind of crime.\n\n\u2018We want people to know that we take all reports of hate crime very seriously and will always investigate.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
