Their sporting director Javier Ribalta said to me: \u2018Are you crazy? His release clause is \u20ac68m.\u2019\n\n\"I told him you can negotiate with Arsenal. I am sure they will be ready to accept something between \u20ac50m and \u20ac55m. His salary would be \u20ac7-8m after tax.\"\n\nDespite Cheltsov's claims, football.london has claimed that Arsenal had no intention of parting company with Lacazette, who has found the net twice in three games already this season.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe publication also denies the suggestions that the French striker has a release clause in his current contract, which runs until 2022.\n\nLacazette has not played since scoring in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham at the start of September as he continues to recover from an ankle injury.\n\nHowever, he could be in line to make his return against Sheffield United after the international break after returning to training at London Colney last week.", "description": "Russian agent Dmitry Cheltsov also suggested that the French striker has a \u00a361million release clause", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18962177.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Arsenal-v-Burnley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
