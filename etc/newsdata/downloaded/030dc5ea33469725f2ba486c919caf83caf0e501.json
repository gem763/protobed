Polster has pushed for a deal that could \"do something meaningful to abate this crisis\".\n\nThe companies have been discussing the settlement with four state attorneys general whose cases are not before Polster, sources told Reuters on Wednesday. Lawyers for the local governments say they have not decided whether to back it.\n\nUnder the proposal, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health would pay $18bn over 18 years and Johnson & Johnson would pay $4bn, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nTeva has offered to give away medications it values at $15bn as part of an overall deal it values at roughly $28m. Under that deal, the company would also provide distribution services, the sources said.\n\nSpokespeople for Cardinal CEO Mike Kaufmann and AmerisourceBergen CEO Steven Collis declined to say if they would be in Cleveland on Friday. Representatives for Teva CEO Kare Schultz and McKesson CEO Brian Tyler did not respond to questions about whether they would be in court.\n\nOpioids were responsible for roughly 400,000 overdose deaths in the US from 1999 to 2017, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe lawsuits accuse drug manufacturers of deceptively marketing opioids in ways that downplayed their risks, and drug distributors of failing to detect and halt suspicious orders.\n\nThe companies deny wrongdoing.\n\nThe cases prompted OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP to file for bankruptcy protection in September after reaching a tentative deal it says is worth at least $10bn to resolve the cases.", "description": "Order comes as US distributors and drugmakers move to reach a deal ahead of opioid trial in Cleveland on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/17/a3466ec2379b4e37ab9b93634cdd7bc6_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
