Our strikers will have more confidence. It is tough for the players, but it is not the first time it\u2019s happened this season.\u201d Indeed it wasn\u2019t: it was the second time in three league games that City had failed to score and lost. This will be their 100th league game since that visit to Goodison Park \u2013 it is fair to say that those strikers have no issues with confidence now.

Liverpool have forgotten how to lose; a formidable run of form means they have not tasted defeat on these shores since January, at Wolves in the FA Cup, and with J\u00fcrgen Klopp able to make wholesale changes in victory over MK Dons in midweek, shackling a purring front line of Sadio Man\u00e9, Roberto Firmino and Mo Salah remains a daunting prospect for Chris Wilder\u2019s side. The Sheffield United manager has made it clear his players cannot afford to be \u201cstarry eyed\u201d but acknowledges his three-man defence will be kept busy. \u201cIt might turn into a back 10 or 11,\u201d joked Wilder. \u201cTheir front three is much feted and we\u2019re going to have to have an unbelievably great day to keep the ball out of our net.\u201d BF\n\n\u2022 Sheffield United v Liverpool, Saturday 12.30pm\n\nArsenal cruise past Fiorentina into last 16 thanks to Little and Miedema Read more\n\n3) A stint in the bottom half looms for Manchester United\n\nManchester United are eighth in the table after six unconvincing games and, if results go against them, they could be as low as 14th by the time they kick off on Monday night. However, it is eminently possible that United will be 10th on Monday, should they lose to Arsenal at Old Trafford. This is remarkable enough on its own \u2013 only once since Alex Ferguson\u2019s first title-winning season in 1992-93, when they were briefly 10th between losing at Aston Villa on 7 November and beating Oldham in their next game, have United been outside the top eight this late in the season: under David Moyes in 2013-14, when they were ninth for a couple of weeks in December. The last time they were in the bottom half at this stage or later was exactly 30 years ago, a mess of a season that United ended in 13th but with a probably managerial career-saving FA Cup win. This is the kind of crisis that most clubs in the country would dream of but for this one would count as a rare old pickle.

The club tied down 15 players to new contracts following promotion, as well as the manager, Daniel Farke, but extending the 35-year-old sporting director\u2019s stay last week is perhaps their best move yet. Webber\u2019s work is clear in a Norwich team who travel to Selhurst Park \u2013 where Crystal Palace have been defeated only four times this year \u2013 on Saturday. Webber, who said he plans to leave Norwich at the end of the 2021-22 season, pieced together a title-winning jigsaw, slashing the wage bill and placing an onus on a burgeoning academy. This summer the club\u2019s net spend was \u00a31.4m, half of which they paid for Sam Byram, one of only two permanent signings. The major investment was into rewarding those that got them this far, as well as adding to their pool of young talent, namely the England Under-19 midfielder Daniel Adshead from Rochdale.

The next fortnight already feels hugely significant, with a trip to Norwich following Saturday\u2019s home game against Burnley. After the international break they host Brighton, whom they beat in midweek, and then face teams who qualified for Europe last season in six of their next seven matches. Dean Smith gave his \u00a322m record signing Wesley a breather in the Carabao Cup, with Keinan Davis handed a rare start, but the striker squandered two golden opportunities late on. It did not matter, with victory wrapped up, but the concern for Villa is that they remain light on options in the final third. Villa rebuffed plenty of Championship interest to keep hold of Davis as competition for Wesley but, for now, Smith\u2019s shallow pool of strikers remains unconvincing. BF\n\n\u2022 Aston Villa v Burnley, Saturday 3pm.\n\n6) Pochettino to face the music against his former side\n\nMauricio Pochettino alluding to agendas is a worrying train of thought. His Southampton tenure ended cryptically and, just as Tottenham have struggled to convince, Pochettino seems to be having the same problem, presumably fed up with putting on a brave face. Pochettino said it is his job to harmonise a fragmented squad, going on to acknowledge that January and next summer provide the perfect opportunity to iron out the creases; it would be a surprise if any of Christian Eriksen, Danny Rose, Toby Alderweireld or Jan Vertonghen started next season at Spurs, who have gone stale as a result of uncertainty. Another destabilising sub-plot is Pochettino\u2019s own future, with the Argentinian asked to fight on four fronts \u2013 before defeat by Colchester \u2013 with essentially the same squad as last season, but for Tanguy Ndombele. The best way for Pochettino to dampen the noise? Get one over on his former club.

But against City, Angelo Ogbonna did not feature in defence. He has partnered Issa Diop at centre-back in the five league games since, with the Hammers conceding only two league goals as they have won three and drawn two. Ogbonna and Diop have developed a fine understanding at the heart of the Hammers\u2019 defence and it is little surprise that, without Ogbonna, West Ham were a mess at the back against Oxford United. In the league their rock-solid displays have helped Manuel Pellegrini to build a happy camp at West Ham, which is not something one often associates with a squad that has carried a few too many tempestuous characters in the past. A trip to the league\u2019s other surprise package, sixth-placed Bournemouth, will be another test of the Hammers\u2019 defensive solidity. The Cherries have scored six and taken six points from their last two league games. They might not get much joy out of the happy Hammers\u2019 defence, though.

Back from the treatment room, Callum Hudson-Odoi played for the whole of Chelsea\u2019s 7-1 thumping of Grimsby in the Carabao Cup in midweek after a long spell on the sidelines and may feature off the bench at some point against Graham Potter\u2019s side. In his post-Grimsby press conference Frank Lampard was critical of the winger\u2019s first-half contribution, saying what was expected of him \u201chad to be reinforced pretty strongly\u201d at half-time. While the pep-talk worked, one suspects it may be a little while yet before the 18-year-old is trusted to make his first start of the season in the Premier League.

Given that Watford suffered public humiliation when they were eviscerated 8-0 at Manchester City in their last Premier League outing, Wolves fans must be feeling confident that their league campaign will finally be given lift-off against wounded opponents. A home win might not be that straightforward, though. Watford\u2019s 2-1 victory in the Carabao Cup against the second best team in the Championship, Swansea, may already have acted as the soothing balm Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores\u2019s team needed to recover from their Etihad trauma. Danny Welbeck scored in that game and S\u00e1nchez Flores may be tempted to throw him into the mix at Molineux. Wolves have had a tricky start to the Premier League season. None of their six games to date have been easily winnable ones. If they do not take three points from this one, though, their season could be a long, painful slog.

Largely outplayed, out-passed and out-thought in a match that will not live long in the memory of anyone unfortunate enough to witness it, only the stunningly acrobatic intervention of Fabian Sch\u00e4r helped them to hang on for a draw. \u201cWe got away with one,\u201d said Steve Bruce, after bemoaning his side\u2019s inability to get the ball from Brighton. Away at Leicester, they are likely to see even less of it and against a side that is more prolific in front of goal than last week\u2019s opposition, they could pay a heavy price.
