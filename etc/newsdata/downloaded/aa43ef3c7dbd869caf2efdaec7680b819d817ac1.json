SP500 is down -4.5% in August so far. President Trump continued his tweets on the Fed, tariffs on China, Allies ahead of G-7, and ordered the US companies to seek alternatives to China. Market strategists may start revising their SP500 targets and timetable for recession.\n\nHK CK Hutchinson is attractive [CHHUY; yield 4.5%; fwd P/E 7; P/B 0.6]; almost 85% of its earnings are outside of HK and China. US billboard company Clear Channel Outdoor is attractive [CCO; fwd EV/EBITDA 10]; stock is depressed because its former controlling owner IHRT distributed millions of CCO shares to creditors as part of bankruptcy exit, and CCO also issued additional shares to tap into opportunities in its fragmented market. As Warren Buffett turns 89, BRK-A/B is attractive [P/B 1.3]; stock Is suffering from 27% stake in KHC; someday its parts would be more valuable than the sum.\n\nPg 7, Streetwise: New ethical-industrial complex says that doing good things [for employees, customers and economy] will also lead to higher profits, but there won\u2019t be a focus on just maximizing profits. RTN, MO are touting their good deeds. Some car companies [F, HMC, etc] have agreed to tougher CA targets for mileage and emissions. Several companies [WMT, TGT, AMZN, etc] have set minimum wages higher than the federal standard. CB will stop insuring companies that get more than 30% of their revenues from coal. Listen, but be careful about company claims and be skeptical.\n\nPg 8-9: No notable upcoming meetings.\n\nGlobal dividend-growth for Q2 has slowed to +1.1% due to global slowdown; the US dividend-growth was +3.9%.\n\nCosmetics giant COTY stock has been like a rollercoaster ride. New CEO started in 2019. German Jab Holding has 60% stake. It reports on Wednesday.\n\nData this week: Durable goods report, Dallas Fed Texas manufacturing outlook on Monday; consumer confidence, home price index on Tuesday; Q2 GDP growth [2nd est], pending home sales on Thursday; personal income and consumption, Chicago PMI, consumer sentiment on Friday.\n\nBullish Recommendations: GameStop [GME; -71% YTD on recent disappointments, technical selling, required changes in lease accounting; volatile situation with 60%+ shares short; 90% of 5,700 stores have positive cash flows; new optical disk drives coming from MSFT, SNE; 3% stake by Michael Burry of Scion Asset Management ; pg 10];\n\nNestle [NSRGY; yield 2.3%; fwd P/E 24] is up +30% YTD and is still attractive; selling noncore businesses; 23% stake in cosmetics LRLCY is worth $25 billion; activist Loeb/ Third Point has a stake; pg 11];\n\nROKU [+350% YTD; losses; P/S 11; 2017 IPO; offers hardware & software for streaming on the Internet, 44% market share, also licenses to TV manufacturers; free, on-demand content but ad-supported; pg 19].\n\nBearish Recommendations: None self standing\n\nPg 12: Stocks and bonds are both at/near highs. That makes convertibles attractive \u2013 they have 75% of the upside of stocks but only 50% of the downside. They have also outperformed 60-40 balanced portfolios. Convertibles range from growthy to busted and many fund managers stay in the middle [so called balanced convertibles]. Mentioned are mutual funds FISCX, PACIX; ETF CWB; CEF AVK.\n\nPg 13: Think of the hike in minimum wage as middle-class sales tax. 67% of Americans support lifting the federal minimum wage of $7.25/hr and several cities, counties, states and companies have done so on their own. The effective minimum wage in the US is $9.50/hr now [excluding tipped workers], about 42% of the median wage. A recently passed House Bill proposes to lift it to $15/hr by 2025 [to almost 60% of median wage] and eliminate subminimum wages [for students, disabled, tipped workers]; it may not pass in the Senate. In countries that have drastically increased minimum wages in recent times [Hungary, Poland], it was found that job losses were minimal and most businesses passed on wage increases as higher prices, and the effect on consumers was like a higher sales tax; exporters were hurt as they couldn\u2019t raise prices due to global competition and some had to use more automation to cut labor costs.\n\nPg 14: Cover Story, \u201cFootball and The Future of TV\u201d. NFL and TV cannot be without each other. Media rights for 2023- are being negotiated now [for 1987-89, $1.4 billion; for 2014-22, $42.7 billion]. CBS [soon to merge with VIAB], Fox/NWSA, NBC/CMCSA have most exposure to sports, ESPN-ABC/DIS the least [and that may also change]. Somethings have changed since the last round of talks. Supremes have allowed states to legalize sports betting and that may add more viewers. Streaming is big now and large tech companies [AMZN, GOOGL] are getting interested in bidding for digital rights. There are also mobile rights [currently owned by VZ].\n\nPg 20: Jonathan Bloom and Pat English of large-cap value FMIHX have a concentrated portfolio of 20-30 stocks. They are expecting a big bear market, but instead of going to cash, they are focusing on companies with competitive advantages, strong balance sheets, discounts from intrinsic value, etc. Top 5 holdings are BRK-B, HON, DG, UNH, JPM.\n\nPg 22: Avoid crypto-related trusts GBTC and ETHE. Their new shares can be bought by accredited investors at NAV but those can be sold at astronomical premiums to retail investors in unregulated OTC market. So, accredited investors benefit at the expense of retail investors. If interested in cryptos, just open a crypto account at Coinbase , etc.\n\nPg 23: While the reopening of Vanguard dividend-growth VDIGX [active] has been in the news, Vanguard has several other dividend choices. For dividend-growth, ETFs VIG, VIGI [and their corresponding indexed OEFs]. For current-dividend, VEIRX [active] and ETFs VYM, VYMI [and their corresponding OEFs].\n\nPg 24: Betsy Graseck [MS] turned cautious on banks/financials after the Fed stress-tests as much of the good news was priced in. By mid-2020, she projects fed funds at 1.33%, 10-yr at 1.5%. She likes JPM, AXP, DFS but is underweight trust-banks [BK, STT].\n\nPg 26: Edward Yardeni and Joseph Abbott, Yardeni Research . New book, Stock Buybacks: The True Story , 2019. Limiting or banning buybacks, as some politicians have proposed, is a bad idea. That would do nothing to solve income/wealth inequality, low capex, low productivity. Many companies use buybacks to offset dilution from employee stock and option grants and the net buyback is small [often 1/3rd of gross buybacks]. Buybacks have not boosted SP500 EPS growth much over the aggregate earnings growth. The idea that buybacks contribute to shareholder yield [ = %dividend_yield + %buyback] is also questionable. Book provides supporting data.\n\nExtras from Friday \u2013 I try to guess on Friday which features will make it in the weekend edition but the following guesses didn\u2019t make it. Almost 75-80% of the weekend edition is now available by 9:00 PM Central on Friday. Barron\u2019s revised website has \u201cInterests\u201d tabs similar to columns topics and that makes it easier to find potential items for the weekend edition. This is also the reason for earlier postings on Saturday \u2013 I do wait for my paper delivery [typically between 5:00-6:30 AM Central] to fill in some data.\n\nSelling puts on GE are recommended. For some income, write calls in the expectation that the upside is limited. Earnings are due Oct 30.\n\nPrivate-equity is enhancing returns with leverage from subscription-lines or capital-call financing. These preapproved credit lines may have maturities up to 5 years.\n\nMark Hulbert found that gold-silver ratio didn\u2019t have much predictive value. He also analyzed gold-platinum ratio that is bullish for the stock market.\n\nSelected features from Advisory Directory supplement on recession shelters.\n\nPg S3: How to prepare for the worst? US-China trade war? Brexit? Iran? Multiple things at once? Consider de-risking. Hold some Treasuries, gold, cash. More specifically:\n\nScenario 1 \u2013 Global Debt/Credit Crisis. Have liquidity. Hold T-Bonds, gold, high-quality dividend-paying stocks.\n\nScenario 2 \u2013 US-China Trade War Out of Control. Hold T-Bonds, gold, healthcare, companies with good cash flow, Japanese yen.\n\nScenario 3 \u2013 Loss of Confidence in the US. Hold gold, cybersecurity stocks, market-neutral funds, alternatives.\n\nPg S6: There are several survivalists/preppers projects: 58-luxury condos in a converted missile silo in Cloud County, KS; a few other missile silos are being developed in condos; Vivos has built 575 underground shelters in South Dakota and 300-person underground shelter in New Zealand. Several billionaires are rumored to own such units in the event of some global catastrophe.\n\nPg S10: Rob Arnott, Research Affiliates [RA]. His firm has almost 200 factor-based or fundamental indexes [RA, FTSE, Russell] with $184 billion tied to them including $34 billion at Pimco, $27 billion at Schwab. Yield-curve doesn\u2019t predict recession, but it can cause one if people defer risky and long-term projects. The Fed can lose control if it gets too far behind the curve. There is little serial-correlation in returns, so what worked in the past may not work today, and what is working today may not work in future. Stock investors are seriously misguided in their expectations of past/historic returns. Total return [TR] is the sum of yield, growth and multiple expansion/contraction. Cash and broad market yields are close to inflation; growth has slowed; multiples have risen, so the outlook for future market TR is not bright. Market-cap-based indexing is concentrating money into small number of top stocks and that can/has led to tremendous overvaluation.\n\nEMs are very cheap on relative valuation, some may be for valid reasons [Russia, Turkey], but selected EMs are attractive. EM-value is in an anti-bubble. Some non-US developed markets are also attractive \u2013 Brexit and EU issues have hurt European stocks but those are transient issues. Unfortunately, in a bull market, most investors don\u2019t have the patience for lagging investments. But they should have target allocations and then add/subtract around those positions as things move down/up. Crypto currencies are in a bubble now \u2013 most past bubbles could be seen only in the hindsight.\n\nHis personal investments include EM deep-value [about 50% but not 100% just in case his strong conviction is wrong], credit-risks [HY, etc], commodities, EAFE-value [astonishingly lagging growth], and 0% in the US [expensive but not in a bubble yet].\n\nYBB", "description": "Pg 5, Up & Down Wall Street: What happened to Summer doldrums?
