And I know it\u2019s not in the original film of Cats.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m like, \u201cThis is the one and this is my moment.\u201d There\u2019s no top line. So, a top line on a song is the words and the melody that somebody sings.\n\n\u2018So if you have a song stuck in your head, chances are you\u2019re singing the top line.\u2019\n\nTaylor Swift shares sneak preview of Cats original song (Picture: Universal)\n\nThe Calm Down hitmaker continued: \u2018What he has got is this beautiful instrumental piece. As soon as he starts playing it, I start singing the top line. I knew exactly what this character would say if she was going to sing a song. I knew where in the movie they were going to put her song.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pop star explained how she had planned for this moment, and started to gather data before her audition.\n\n\u2018I knew that it would be after Memory,\u2019 she went on: \u2018I thought, wouldn\u2019t it be interesting if you had this little young kitten reflect off of what she just heard and give sort of her counterpoint of view?\n\n\u2018Because Memory is Grizabella singing about how she had all these beautiful, incredible moments in her past. She had these glittering occasions and she felt beautiful and she felt wanted and now she doesn\u2019t feel that way anymore.\n\nWe\u2019re already crying (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018And I was just thinking, okay, so what if you\u2019ve got this little kitten that\u2019s been deserted and kind of tossed out by her owners and she\u2019s had to wander around the streets of London wondering where she\u2019s going to find a home. Wouldn\u2019t she be thinking, \u201cat least you had those amazing memories.\u201d\u2018\n\nReciting some of the lyrics she has voiced to Lloyd Webber, Taylor revealed: \u2018And the memories were lost long ago, but at least you have beautiful ghosts.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe smirked: \u2018Well, I appreciated it. Because I just wanted it to be, I wanted to get in the head of the character and think, if she was hearing somebody lamenting about wonderful, miraculous, majestic, incredible times, having this extraordinary life behind her.\n\n\u2018I could see this young person thinking like, \u201cWhat if I never have any of that in my whole life? What if that\u2019s lost on me? What if I don\u2019t get that ever? At least you have that to cling to.\u201d\n\n\u2018The first line is, \u201cFollow me home if you dare to, I wouldn\u2019t know where to lead you. Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?\u201d And it goes, \u201cSo I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start, with no beauty in my memory.\u201d\u2019\n\nCats is released in cinemas on 20 December.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
