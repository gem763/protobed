The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning, urging people to take care as rain across northern England on Friday becomes heavy and persistent, lasting into Saturday. A little snow is possible for a time across the higher Pennine routes. Forecasters say some 25-40 mm of rain is likely quite widely with as much as 70 mm in places, especially high ground. Areas affected: East Midlands Derbyshire North East England Darlington Durham North West England Cumbria Greater Manchester Lancashire Wales West Midlands Yorkshire & Humber South West England\n\nThe Environment Agency has today put six flood warnings in place, covering the lower Avon, lower River Soar in Leicestershire, north Kesteven, Rase and Upper Ancholme, the River Evenlode, the River Glyme and the River Mole.\n\nThe Met Office's warnings state: 'Rain is expected to arrive across parts of the UK during Friday and become heavy and persistent, this is especially true for high ground exposed to the strong southwesterly wind.\n\n'There remains some uncertainty to the locations likely to see the highest rainfall totals. This rain is expected to continue falling in similar areas for around 24 hours.\n\n'As such during this period 40-60 mm [1.6-2.4in] of rain is likely, with perhaps as much as 100mm [4in] over higher ground.\n\n'There is a small chance that homes and businesses could be flooded, causing damage to some buildings.\n\nThe Met Office added: 'There is a small chance of fast flowing or deep floodwater causing danger to life. Where flooding occurs, there is a slight chance of delays or cancellations to train and bus services.\n\n'Spray and flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures. There is a small chance that some communities become cut off by flooded roads and there is a slight chance of power cuts and loss of other services to some homes and businesses.'\n\nThe October average rainfall for northern England is 100.6mm (3.96in), while in Wales the average is 169.6mm (6.68in).\n\nUp to October 21, northern England has already had up to 87.2mm (3.43in) of rain, while 122mm (4.8in) has fallen in Wales.\n\nThe average October rainfall for England is 91.7mm (3.61in) and 86.9mm (3.42in) has already fallen this month.\n\nBut the Met Office said record rainfall totals for the month are unlikely to be broken.\n\nThe wettest October in northern England and Wales was in 1967, when 176.5mm (6.94in) of rain fell in northern England and 303.5mm (11.94in) in Wales.\n\nWeather warnings covering areas likely to have the heaviest rain were issued for almost all of Wales, plus Cumbria and the Pennines as far south as the Derbyshire Peak District (pictured left: Exmouth seafront, Devon.

It is currently mild with temperatures of up to 16C (61F) but by Sunday the whole country is likely to be in colder air, with widespread overnight frosts on Sunday into Monday.'\n\nDaytime temperatures are likely to fall to between 9C and 12C (48-54F).\n\nForecasters say the 'drier, more settled weather' could continue into November, with fine days and some frosty nights.", "description": "Wet weather is expected in Wales and northern England, where up to four inches of rain is forecast for high ground.
