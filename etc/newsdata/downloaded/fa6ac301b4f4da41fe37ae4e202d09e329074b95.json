The defeat leaves Tottenham eight points behind Leicester and Chelsea, who occupy the third and fourth Champions League positions, and that gap has suddenly started to feel big.\n\nMauricio Pochettino has urged Tottenham's squad to stick together and emerge stronger\n\nBut Pochettino's first objective is to get Tottenham back into the top half of the table and find a solution to the difficulties his team are having on the road.\n\n'In this season we deserve more points,' he said. 'It's a moment to stay strong, to keep pushing.\n\n'Of course in a different season this could have finished two or three nil for us. But today it went a different way and we need to stay calm and take the best decisions for the future.\n\n'We have the squad and we are supporting them. We have 29 players and we are going to have lots of players to play. I've nothing to say because after five-and-a-half years it's a moment to be all together and show our support.'\n\nOnce again Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp got the better of Pochettino on the big stage\n\nMohamed Salah's penalty proved to be the difference. The Egyptian, who was substituted late on after an ankle issue flared up, converted after the Serge Aurier bundled Sadio Mane over after losing possession to the Liverpool forward. Pochettino had no inclination to argue.\n\n'It's a selection that I don't want to complain,' said Pochettino. 'I need to accept the decision. Technically there is a contact but the ball is going away or to the side. Yes there is an action, but it's soft and it's a penalty. So I've nothing to say.\n\n'It's an action that happens in football a lot, there are a lot of actions like this. It was just unlucky for us we conceded a penalty and lost the game. I'm happy with Aurier but he is not happy. Nobody is happy.'\n\nThe lack of consistency through Tottenham's team was an issue and Dele Alli, who began brightly but faded, was the subject of stinging criticism on Sky from Graeme Souness, Roy Keane and Gary Neville, all of whom argued that the England midfielder has lost his way.\n\nJordan Henderson and Mohamed Salah scored to turn round Liverpool's fortunes at Anfield\n\n'I thought he was going to be a star,' said Souness. 'I think he's a classic case of someone who's in his armchair. They gave him a four, five year contract, and look what's happened. He's taken his eye off the ball but he's a shadow of himself.'\n\nIf Pochettino was sombre, Jurgen Klopp was buoyant after Liverpool restored their lead at the top to six points. He insisted Salah's ankle problem was 'nothing serious' and hailed the way his team recovered from an early jolt.\n\n'The game I loved,' said Klopp. 'A super game, how football should look, how we should play against a really strong good organised side.'", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino\u00a0has urged Tottenham's squad to stick together and emerge stronger from their turbulent start to the season.", "authors": ["Dominic King For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/22/20257938-0-image-a-8_1572215122141.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
