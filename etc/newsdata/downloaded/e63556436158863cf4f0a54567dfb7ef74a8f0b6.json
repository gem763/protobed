For many of us, the real culprit could be a lack of magnesium", "language": "en", "text": "At first, Annie Evans thought it was a depressing sign of getting older. Just getting washed and dressed in the morning was leaving her too worn out to do much else.\n\n'It was more than just tiredness,' says Annie. 'I was exhausted all the time. But at 74, I was just putting it down to old age.'\n\nBy the time winter arrived, Annie was left with 'no energy at all'.\n\nSo when her husband heard that a magnesium supplement could help, she knew she had to give it a try. Annie found the difference remarkable. 'After just two weeks, I was like a new woman,' she says.\n\nMany people across the UK often feel exhausted and are lacking in energy\n\nLike Annie, more and more British people are discovering a link between a lack of magnesium in their diet and a lack of energy that can get worse with age.\n\nThat\u2019s because magnesium is an essential mineral that contributes to our normal psychological and muscle functions. Low levels of it in our bodies can lead to tiredness that affects both our muscles and mood.\n\nIt helps our muscles and nervous system function correctly, keeps our bones and teeth strong and is important for brain functions like concentration and memory.\n\nBut the latest National Diet & Nutrition Survey has shown that only half of us in the UK are getting our recommended daily intake of magnesium, and it gets harder as we get older.\n\nMagnesium+ is formulated with magnesium lactate, a highly soluble organic form that's much easier for the body to absorb than magnesium oxide\n\nMagnesium is naturally present in foods like kale and spinach, black beans, nuts, bananas and whole grains. Our bodies have to absorb magnesium to take advantage of its benefits. The ease with which a mineral is absorbed by the body is called \u2018bioavailability\u2019. But magnesium isn\u2019t always so \u2018bioavailable\u2019.\n\n'Some magnesium salts may contain a high concentration of magnesium but it's not easily released into the body because it's not so soluble,' explains Miriam Ferrer PhD, head of product development at FutureYou Cambridge, a leading nutritional supplement company.\n\nTo address this, the FutureYou Cambridge scientists set out to develop a supplement specially designed to maximise the body's magnesium uptake, called Magnesium+.\n\nMiriam Ferrer PhD, head of product development at FutureYou Cambridge, a leading nutritional supplement company\n\nMagnesium+ works by using a bioavailable formulation called magnesium lactate, a highly soluble organic form that's easy for the body to absorb.\n\nLike Annie, people who have given Magnesium+ a try have reported very positive experiences.\n\nAfter a few months on the supplement, Annie found she was able to maintain her energy levels.\n\n'I can enjoy gardening again without getting very tired,' she says. 'Since then, I have taken Magnesium+ religiously every day.'\n\nOnline magazine editor Annabel Simons, 60, was told she was lacking magnesium, but was at first skeptical about the effects she would feel by taking Magnesium+\n\nAt first, 60-year-old Annabel Simons was skeptical about just how much of a difference Magnesium+ could make to her life.\n\nAnnabel writes the award-winning blog Annabel & Grace for older women and enjoys an active lifestyle of everything from burlesque shows to ballroom dancing. But physical problems started holding her back.\n\nAnnabel made some lifestyle changes but they had few positive effects. She was told by her doctor she should take magnesium.\n\n\u201cInitially, I thought I could be imagining the improvements, but I genuinely believe that Magnesium+ has helped maintain my normal energy levels,\u201d she says.\n\n'This combination meant my general wellbeing was much better. Suddenly exercise seemed easier and with more exercise, that cycle of improvement only got better.'\n\n'Magnesium+ allows us to absorb greater amounts of this important mineral into the body while actually consuming less,' explains Ferrer. 'Not only is it more than twice as absorbable as magnesium oxide, but you take less per capsule, making it less likely to cause side effects.'\n\nRoger Dean, who has relished the opportunity to get back in the garden since starting Magnesium+\n\nLike Annabel, 71-year-old Roger Dean could have been forgiven for giving another magnesium supplement a miss.\n\nRoger began getting physical complaints after a kidney transplant in 2017 and gave Magnesium+ a try. \u201cNow I\u2019m out gardening and doing a lot more than I used to,\u201d he says. \"Life just seems more manageable.\u201d\n\nHowever, Roger noticed the most dramatic difference when he accidentally stopped taking the one-a-day capsules, sold in packs of 28 from \u00a310.40 on subscription.\n\n'When I forgot to take Magnesium+ on holiday with me last year, the problems came back almost straight away,' he says.\n\nMichelle has found that Magnesium+ has had a positive impact on her mood\n\nMichelle Green, 52, a busy mum-of-two who also runs a blog for over fifties, Fifty & Fab, takes one tablet every night before she goes to bed.\n\nExperiencing menopause, Michelle has found the difference Magnesium+ makes is not so much physical. Instead it\u2019s normal psychological function, meaning her mood and mental well-being.\n\n'That has a knock-on effect for everyday life. I think it's something we should all be taking.'", "description": "More and more British people are discovering a link between a lack of magnesium in their diet and a lack of energy that can get worse with age.", "authors": ["Mailonline Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/17/20131406-0-image-a-2_1572370108212.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
