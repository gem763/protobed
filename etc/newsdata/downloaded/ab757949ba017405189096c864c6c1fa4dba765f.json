Times' new Kavanaugh claims", "language": "en", "text": "Senate investigators said Monday that the FBI ended the investigation of alleged sexual misconduct in college by Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh after interviewing at least four people involved in the purported incident who could not substantiate the story.\n\nDetails of the dead end for the probe blew holes in claims published in The New York Times that investigators dropped the ball, perhaps purposely, during the brutal confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh. It also undermined calls by Democratic presidential hopefuls and lawmakers to reopen the case and pursue impeachment of the high court justice.\n\nSenate investigators involved in the probe said their work was mischaracterized in the article, posted Saturday in The Times\u2019 opinion section.\n\n\u201cA year ago, The New York Times did not even find Deborah Ramirez\u2019s flimsy at best allegations fit to print,\u201d said Mike Davis, a former Senate Judiciary Committee counsel who worked on the Kavanaugh confirmation. \u201cThese allegations have not gotten any truer over the last year, and this is just the left\u2019s attempt to repackage and relitigate their lies and smears against Justice Kavanaugh, a very good man.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper opinion piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly was adapted from their anti-Kavanaugh book set for release this week.\n\nIt rehashed allegations made by Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale University with Justice Kavanaugh. She said last year during the justice\u2019s confirmation process that he had thrust his penis in her face at a party at Yale.\n\nHowever, another Senate Judiciary Committee staffer said the FBI interviewed Ms. Ramirez about her claim as well as two purported eyewitnesses to the incident. Agents also interviewed one of Ms. Ramirez\u2019s close friends from college. The staffer\u2019s account is backed up by a 2018 report by The Associated Press.\n\nIn the newspaper article, Ms. Pogrebin and Ms. Kelly also say friends pushed the justice\u2019s penis into the hand of another female student at a party. They said the story has \u201cechoes\u201d of Ms. Ramirez\u2019s allegations.\n\nAn \u201ceditor\u2019s note\u201d was later added to clarify that the unidentified woman declined to be interviewed and that, according to friends, she does not remember the episode.\n\nMax Stier, a former classmate who allegedly said he saw Justice Kavanaugh with his pants down at a party, also declined to discuss the incident publicly, according to the report. Mr. Stier is the CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group, and has been a lawyer at Williams & Connolly, which has provided legal defense to the Clintons over the years.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee during the confirmation hearings, said his staff chased down eight people linked to Ms. Ramirez during the committee\u2019s investigation into alleged misconduct and never heard from Mr. Stier or anything about the other incident alleged by The New York Times.\n\n\u201cThis is not an allegation. It\u2019s barely a thirdhand rumor. These writers didn\u2019t even speak to the man who they claimed originally recounted this rumor,\u201d Mr. Grassley said on the chamber floor. \u201cWhat\u2019s left is only layers and layers of decades-old hearsay.\u201d\n\nBut Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the committee, said her side was aware of Mr. Stier\u2019s allegation and requested an FBI inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe FBI could have conducted an investigation that would have been seen as objective by both sides. Unfortunately, it\u2019s now clear the FBI largely ignored these requests because the scope of its investigation was so constrained by the White House and Senate Republicans. It\u2019s unfortunate the FBI wasn\u2019t allowed to do its job,\u201d she said.\n\nThe holes in the story have not deterred Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s detractors.\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris of California, a Democratic presidential candidate, brushed aside questions about the evidence and the editor\u2019s note and demanded the impeachment of Justice Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cThe fact that someone does not remember the details of that incident doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s a lack of evidence if there are other witnesses who can establish that the fact occurred,\u201d she said on NPR. \u201cAnd so I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s no evidence. It is also, I must say, very normal for someone \u2014 especially someone who has been the subject of this kind of behavior \u2014 to not be clear on the details.\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro were other 2020 Democratic contenders who called for impeachment proceedings, though not all Democrats were eager.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, appeared hesitant to open impeachment proceedings against Justice Kavanaugh because his panel is focused on questions of impeachment regarding the president.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said the allegation is another \u201cunhinged\u201d personal attack from Democrats, who recently filed a brief at the Supreme Court threatening the justices with court-packing if they issue decisions they don\u2019t like. He noted that six 2020 presidential candidates have proposed expanding the court.\n\n\u201cIt would be a mistake to dismiss this as a bad case of sour grapes. This is not just a left-wing obsession with one man. It\u2019s part of a deliberate effort to attack judicial independence,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, flatly rejected any calls to impeach the high court justice.\n\nThe calls for impeachment are no surprise to court watchers, who long anticipated an attempt by the left to discredit the justice ahead of any 5-4 rulings.\n\nThey also noted that the impeachment rhetoric has been revived ahead of the 2020 presidential election, giving any moves against the justice heightened political scrutiny.\n\n\u201cIt is about working up the base and maybe convincing it that judges matter, something Republicans have known for at least two generations,\u201d said Lucas Powe, a law professor at the University of Texas.\n\nLegal scholars noted that the Democrat-controlled House could vote to impeach Justice Kavanaugh if lawmakers believe he lied during his confirmation hearings, but the Republican-controlled Senate likely would not vote to remove the justice.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats do not actually think they will remove him from office. Their goal is to diminish his legitimacy as a judge,\u201d said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law.\n\n\u201cBeyond impeachment, Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s opponents will continue to use all of the allegations to delegitimize any 5-4 decision he joins,\u201d he Mr. Blackman said.\n\nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said Democrats would need \u201cclear and conclusive\u201d evidence to reopen the controversy surrounding the justice\u2019s confirmation about a year ago.\n\n\u201cThere is a danger that politicians will seek \u2018do-overs\u2019 with shifting majorities or political realities,\u201d he said.\n\nIlya Shapiro, the publisher of the Cato Institute\u2019s Supreme Court Review, said the article provided nothing new other than insinuations by people who did not have direct knowledge of the relevant allegations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise that Democrats are now making political hay out of all this, but it\u2019s all smoke, no fire,\u201d he told The Washington Times.\n\nHe also cautioned Democrats against going after the justice. At least two Democratic senators who were up for reelection in states President Trump won and who voted against Justice Kavanaugh in October lost their Senate seats.\n\n\u201cCalling for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment is a dangerous move that may end up backfiring, just as Democrats running in close Senate elections were hurt last year after the confirmation imbroglio,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh also faced sexual misconduct allegations from Christine Blasey Ford, who said he touched her inappropriately while the two were at a high school party more than three decades ago. Her allegation was never corroborated.\n\n\u2981 Jeff Mordock, Gabriella Mu\u00f1oz and James Varney contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
