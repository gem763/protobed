The width and level at which the band was centered was unchanged.\n\nThe Singapore dollar rose slightly against the U.S. dollar on the day.\n\n\"It's a slight reduction in the rate of appreciation. They did not say the policy was neutral so it suggests that the slope is still positive,\" said Barclays (LON: ) economist Brian Tan.\n\nEleven economists polled by Reuters had all expected Singapore to ease - its first such move since April 2016.\n\nSingapore's economy grew less than expected in the third quarter but avoided slipping into a technical recession, flash data showed on Monday.\n\nMAS increased the slope of the policy band twice last year in efforts to control rising price pressures and strengthen its currency, in its first such tightening moves in six years.\n\nBut a prolonged tariff dispute between the United States and China - two of Singapore's biggest export markets - has disrupted global supply chains in many trade-reliant economies, including the city state.\n\nManufacturing has been hit particularly hard, buffeted by the trade tensions and a cyclical downturn in the electronics sector.\n\nThe Singapore government is expected to roll out a generous budget next year as polls loom and the ruling party seeks to appease voters who are feeling the pinch from the economic downturn.\n\nMAS expects full-year growth to come in around the mid-point of its 0-1% forecast range, and to \"improve modestly\" in 2020. However, economists see room for further easing next year.\n\n\"They (MAS) decided to be gradual instead of pre-emptive,\" said Jeff Ng, Continuum Economics' chief economist for Asia.\n\n\"If the trend of slower growth continues in 2020, it may still well be that they continue to ease into 2020.\"", "description": "Singapore eases monetary policy for first time in three years", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9D05G_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
