Japan will now face South Africa in the last eight, the first time the nation has reached this stage of the competition.\n\nAs for Scotland, this is just the second time in their history that they\u2019ve failed to progress beyond the group stages, with Townsend under the spotlight and facing questions over his future as head coach of the national side.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

That made it very difficult to get the result we were looking for, but the players really put huge effort into that next 10-15 minutes and with 58 minutes gone, we were only seven points behind, but we didn\u2019t do enough to get the win.\n\n\u201cOf course [being knocked out] is a major blow. We came here with high aspirations and getting out of the pool stage was stage one of that. We\u2019ve worked really hard over the last four months and throughout this tournament to go further than we did tonight so it\u2019s obviously very disappointing not to make it out of the pool.\u201d\n\nTownsend\u2019s men needed an eight-point triumph to book a quarter-final slot and it looked promising when Russell put them ahead early.\n\nBut the Brave Blossoms hit back with a series of ceaseless attacks as they repeatedly crashed through the Dark Blues to secure top spot in Pool A and a rematch with their 2015 victims South Africa in Tokyo next Sunday.\n\nKenki Fukuoka grabbed a double, while star winger Kotaro Matsushima scored his fifth of the tournament \u2013 but it was prop Keita Inagaki who finished off a stunning move that will be hard to beat for try of the competition.\n\nScotland refused to go down without a fight but second-half scores from forwards WP Nel and Zander Fagerson were not enough to prevent the Scots succumbing to defeat.", "description": "Gregor Townsend\u00a0was left to bemoan two \u201csoft\u201d tries after seeing his Scotland\u00a0side\u00a0fail to qualify for the quarter-finals of the Rugby World Cup following their 28-21 defeat by hosts Japan.", "authors": ["Samuel Lovett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/13/15/townsend.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
