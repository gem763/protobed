Bush, who also lost the popular vote but won the White House, Bee asked, \u201cCould you imagine what the world would look like if these two weren\u2019t handed the keys to America? No, things wouldn\u2019t be perfect, but we wouldn\u2019t have invaded Iraq, the world would probably be one degree cooler\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Electoral College is so blatantly stupid, some people are suggesting a wacky alternative called democracy,\u201d Bee said, citing a number of 2020 Democratic candidates who have called for the system to be abolished. Because it has benefitted Republicans twice in the past two decades, they are less eager to get rid of it.\n\n\u201cBut the Electoral College isn\u2019t a simple partisan issue,\u201d Bee said. \u201cIf the 38 votes in Texas go blue, Republicans will suddenly decide the Electoral College was born in Kenya.\u201d Regardless of who it benefits, Bee called the system \u201cunfair and undemocratic by design,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s time to ditch it.\u201d\n\nFor more, listen to Samantha Bee on The Last Laugh podcast below:", "description": "\u201cTrump\u2019s so-called election is just one of the many reasons the Electoral College sucks and should be abolished,\u201d the \u201cFull Frontal\u201d host declared.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1438,w_2556,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568260618/SB_26_wvuz0r", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
