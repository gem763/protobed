This is the right and responsible thing to do \u2013 we must get on with governing,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile hopes of a deal surged last week and the government has been ordered by parliament to request an extension under the Benn act, failure to reach an agreement before 31 October would force Javid to take immediate action to support the economy, meaning the full budget would be delayed beyond 6 November.\n\nWith days to go before the deadline for Boris Johnson to clinch a Brexit deal, news of the budget comes before the Queen on Monday sets out his government\u2019s priorities for a new session of parliament.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\n\nThe prime minister has pledged to increase spending on health, schools and policing. Johnson has also promised sweeping tax cuts that could be outlined at the budget. Economists have said the proposed income tax changes would benefit the richest most.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank has also warned that Johnson and Javid risk lifting Britain\u2019s national debt to levels unseen since the mid-1960s, should they implement their spending plans in full and be required to unleash emergency action after a no-deal Brexit.\n\nNicola Sturgeon, the Scottish National party leader, said the announcement of the budget date was \u201can example of the government making things up as it goes along\u201d. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll still be in office on 6 November.\u201d", "description": "Sajid Javid ramps up Brexit pressure by saying budget will be first after UK leaves EU", "authors": ["Richard Partington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a12f888ded2733b82dc26cd8a5fa198ac4bcd14/320_151_4010_2406/master/4010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9fb447df3077a644f5bd5b5b87071472", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
