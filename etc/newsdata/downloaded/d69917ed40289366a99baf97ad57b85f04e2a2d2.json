(Juan DeLeon/Getty Images)\n\nAlex Rodriguez shared a bizarre theory during ESPN\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Baseball\u201d coverage of the New York Mets\u2019 game at the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday \u2014 and it left sports fans scratching their heads.\n\nIn the bottom of the seventh inning, Rodriguez suggested that the Phillies should drop a sacrifice bunt so they could advance a runner to third base. Eventually, he said, it would give them a two-run lead.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhy does that matter?\n\nAccording to A-Rod \u2014 a 14-time All-Star and three-team MVP who played 22 seasons in the league \u2014 an even lead is always better than an odd lead.\n\n\u201cYou always want even leads versus odd leads. Why? The solo home run doesn\u2019t tie it, and the grand slam does not beat you,\u201d Rodriguez said during the game. \u201cKeep it simple.\u201d\n\nAs noted by @WayTooCrisp, this is A-Rod saying one of the dumbest things ever stated by a baseball analyst\u2014and it's on the marquee national baseball broadcast pic.twitter.com/b7dKQU9NZX \u2014 Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) September 2, 2019\n\nWhat?\n\nSure, a two-run lead is better than a one-run lead \u2014 which would fit into Rodriguez\u2019s logic. But isn\u2019t a three-run lead better than a two-run lead? A five-run lead better than a four-run lead? A seven-run lead better than a six-run lead?\n\nIt\u2019s probably safe to assume that every team in the league would take a larger lead any day \u2014 regardless of whether that lead was even or odd.\n\nBetter luck next week, A-Rod.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "According to the New York Yankees legend, an \"even lead\" is always better than an \"odd lead.\" No matter what.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/q_0jMKJ6qR42rzwYkm8ZBQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/maaIGCeoPy_zl3E2TbLWtg--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/dece1480-cdf5-11e9-a1ff-1dc7dcac699d"}
