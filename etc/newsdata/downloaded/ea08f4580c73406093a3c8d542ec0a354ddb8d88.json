But what followed the Times\u2019 story was a deluge of accusations of sexual misconduct toward women by men \u2013 often with a straight-forward power dynamic between older, professionally accomplished men and younger, often vulnerable, women trying to establish a career. Many of the biggest names in media, the arts and politics were brought down.\n\nNow, after the revelations and the downfalls, what is following is a flood of books on the #MeToo movement and how it has begun to reshape gender relations.\n\nNew York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey have chronicled their Weinstein expos\u00e9 in She Said, a powerful review published last week of what it took to break the Weinstein story.\n\nIt joins other books that have already attempted to describe both the roots of the #MeToo movement, including Linda Hirschman\u2019s excellent Reckoning: The Epic Battle Against Sexual Abuse and Harassment, and the latent anger that informs it, including Rebecca Traister\u2019s exploration of the transformative power of female anger, Good and Mad. And there are more books coming on other famous #MeToo cases such as the downfall of TV executive Les Moonves, New Yorker writer Ronan Farrow\u2019s account of his own multiple #MeToo investigations, including on Weinstein, and books on abuse scandals in sports and politics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented because the #MeToo movement is unprecedented,\u201d said Henry Holt editor Libby Burton. \u201cIf the publishing industry works as it should, it can capture a cultural moment in a way that solidifies it, adds legitimacy, and hopefully create social and societal change.\u201d\n\nShe Said: an inside look at the story that brought down Harvey Weinstein Read more\n\nShe Said examines what happens when a bully is cornered and his defenses \u2013 non-disclosure agreements and other more basic, brutal methods of ensuring silence \u2013 are stripped away. Actors Rose McGowan and Gwyneth Paltrow appear as heroes of the hour; the women\u2019s right lawyer Lisa Bloom, the villain for her part \u2013 since regretted \u2013 in attempting throw off the journalists\u2019 investigation and thwart his accusers.\n\nOther books, too, have powerful narratives and colorful casts of characters as the #MeToo phenomenon becomes it own mini-publishing pantheon.\n\nIn October, Farrow, winner of a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on Weinstein in the New Yorker, is set to publish Catch and Kill, described by his publisher as \u201ca true account of the extreme tactics powerful men use to cover up crimes and abuse\u201d.\n\nHis reporting closely followed the Times\u2019, adding the accounts of 13 women who alleged sexual harassment, assault or rape against Weinstein. Farrow\u2019s new book promises to expose corruption \u201cfrom Hollywood to Washington and beyond\u201d and the ways in which \u201csurveillance and intimidation [were] deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability, and silence victims of abuse.\u201d\n\nAlso in the Weinstein file is Ken Auletta\u2019s coming account of attempting to confront the movie producer as far back as 2002. \u201cHis bullying with women, or sexual predations, was a natural outgrowth \u2014 that\u2019s the way he treated everyone, male or female,\u201d Auletta recently told Peter Kafka\u2019s Recode Media.\n\nUltimately, Auletta was unable to unpick the knots of nondisclosure agreements Weinstein used to silence his alleged victims. Auletta says when he confronted Weinstein, the movie producer started to cry and told the writer he\u2019d ruin his marriage.\n\nThe MeToo accounts don\u2019t stop at Hollywood or entertainment.\n\nAbigail Pesta\u2019s retelling of the serial sexual abuse of young gymnasts by Larry Nassar tackles the shocking story of the now-jailed USA Gymnastics national team doctor and osteopathic physician at Michigan State University.\n\nNew York Times reporters Rachel Abrams and James Stewart delve into allegations of sexual harassment and assault by former CBS chief executive Moonves. The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, by the Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, looks into accusations of sexual assault against supreme court justice Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford.\n\nAnd there\u2019s Tanya Selvaratnam\u2019s account Assume Nothing, which tells her story of falling into an abusive relationship with former New York State attorney general Eric Schneiderman, forced to step down while overseeing efforts to prosecute Weinstein.\n\nJulie Brown, whose series of investigative stories in the Miami Herald helped reignite the scandal around sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, also has a book coming. Publisher HarperCollins says the book \u201cwill expose the inner workings of the sexual pyramid scheme Jeffrey Epstein forced the girls into, and will implicate powerful, wealthy and influential politicians, academics, businessmen and public figures\u201d.\n\nAs the #MeToo movement progresses, it\u2019s possible there won\u2019t be another story as enveloping, or one that reaches as far into wealth and power as Epstein\u2019s, whose upscale social circles include many rich and famous and powerful men.\n\nBut i\ufefff there are any cautions here, it\u2019s that these stories tend to reflect a very narrow cast of society, says Henry Holt\u2019s Burton. Left behind in many of these accounts are the day-to-day stories that women face everywhere in their workplaces, homes and social settings.\n\n\u201cThese stories are about women in more powerful positions, actresses or people in the media, without recognizing how this has affected so many populations, including women of color or women with less economic clout. It\u2019s not just in Hollywood or New York media, but it\u2019s across the country and across the world,\u201d said Burton.", "description": "After the published revelations against Harvey Weinstein, a flood of books has begun to reshape gender relations", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d49c08ba35103ab316ded79d3fae6bc5ae4f5fc/0_605_4512_2707/master/4512.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8311f880f9aef7d92cff6fec793b3aa1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
