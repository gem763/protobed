We also arrested a suspect for being in possession of a stolen cellphone. Officers also recovered five MTN tower back-up batteries.\"\n\nMinnaar promised they would continue to raid the area, which was earlier identified as a \"hub\" for counterfeit goods.\n\n\"We have officers who are patrolling the area daily and we are committed to ensure that law and order prevails there.\"\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
