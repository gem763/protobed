My father and the lorry driver have to live with what happened that day for the rest of their lives,' Mrs Neran told the publication.\n\nOn May 31 2018, her father Bhanuchandra Lodhia, 70, was driving along with M6 with Dev in the back while his cousin Ria Soni, 20, sat in the front passenger seat.\n\nThe hard shoulder had become a live lane and Mr Lodhia had stopped with the hazard lights on.\n\nA police investigation established the car was stationary for just 45 seconds before lorry driver Paul Kiddy, 62, from Hampshire, hit the Toyota at about 56 mph.\n\nDev's parents, Meera and Dilesh Naran, are also calling for increased safety measures on smart motorways\n\nDev died instantly while his grandfather and cousin were taken to hospital with injuries. Doctors say they remain too traumatised to give evidence.\n\nAt the inquest, Mr Kiddy wept as he recalled the crash: 'I just disagree with smart motorways. If there had been a hard shoulder we wouldn't be here today.'\n\nThe boss of Highways England admitted this week that thousands of drivers have had their lives endangered after breaking down on 'smart motorways'\n\nA spokesman said any death on its roads was 'one too many', and that it takes safety 'very seriously', insisting that that 'smart motorways include more features to further enhance safety than conventional motorways'.\n\nThe number of motorway deaths is increasing, figures revealed last month, with 107 killed on motorways last year \u2013 up 8 per cent on 2017 (stock photo of motorway in West Yorkshire)\n\nFigures revealed that 19,316 motorists suffered the horror of breaking down in a live lane in 2017 and 2018 \u2013 a rate of 26 drivers every day. This accounted for 38 per cent of all stoppages on smart motorways.\n\nThe AA described the revelation as 'simply unacceptable' and said motorists could die unless 'urgent action' is taken to improve safety.\n\nThe number of motorway deaths is increasing, figures revealed last month, with 107 killed on motorways last year \u2013 up 8 per cent on 2017.\n\nDev's parents previously spoke about of their loss, describing him as a 'kind and compassionate angel'\n\nThey said the Leicester boy excelled at school and devoted time to caring for his younger brother, who suffered brain damage at birth.\n\nThey said: 'He excelled at school and wanted to become a doctor. He looked after his brother Neel, who suffered brain damage at birth.\n\n'He was a big sports fan and loved Leicester City. Dev was the most perfect son in every way.'", "description": "Dev Naran (pictured), from Leicestershire, died when the Toyota Yaris he was in - which was stopped on a hard shoulder temporarily opened to traffic - was hit at 56mph on the M6 in May last year.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/10/19650950-0-image-a-11_1570960099805.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
