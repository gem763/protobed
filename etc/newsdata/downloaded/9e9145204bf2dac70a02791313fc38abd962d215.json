Investigators said the trooper was in serious but stable condition on Saturday, and the other officers were stable.\n\nShauna Saxton said she was driving with her husband and grandson in Odessa and had paused at a stoplight when they heard loud pops.\n\n\"I looked over my shoulder to the left and the gold car pulled up and the man was there and he had a very large gun and it was pointing at me,\" she told TV station KOSA.\n\nSaxton said she was trapped because there were two cars in front of her. \"I started honking my horn. I started swerving and we got a little ahead of him and then for whatever reason the cars in front of me kind of parted,\" she said, sobbing. She said she heard three more shots as she sped away.\n\nThe shooting was the second mass shooting in Texas in a month.
