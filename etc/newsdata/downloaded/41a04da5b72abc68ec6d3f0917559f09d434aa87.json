She said Congress will continue its investigation as part of the Constitution\u2019s system of checks and balances of the executive.\n\n\u201cThis is not a game for us. This is deadly serious. We\u2019re on a path that is taking us, a path to the truth,\u201d Pelosi told reporters after a closed-door session with House Democrats.\n\nWith Ukraine situated between the United States\u2019 Western allies and Russia, Pelosi noted the inquiry raises fresh questions about Trump\u2019s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cAll roads seem to lead to Putin with the president,\u201d she said.\n\nDemocratic leaders had been gauging support for a vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry after Trump and Republicans pushed them for a roll call. Holding a vote would test politically vulnerable Democrats in areas where the president is popular.\n\nTrump calls the impeachment inquiry an \u201cillegitimate process\u201d and is blocking officials from cooperating.\n\nBut several Democratic freshmen who are military veterans or had careers in national security before joining Congress spoke up during the meeting Tuesday, warning Pelosi and her leadership team a vote was unnecessary and would be playing into Republicans\u2019 hands, according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the private session.\n\nThe inquiry is moving quickly as a steady stream of officials appear behind closed doors this week, some providing new revelations about the events surrounding the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. It is on that call that Trump urged Zelenskiy to investigate a firm tied to political rival Joe Biden\u2019s family and Ukraine\u2019s own involvement in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn a daylong session Tuesday, House investigators heard from Kent, who was concerned about the \u201cfake news smear\u201d against the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump recalled in May, according to emails obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nKent told the lawmakers that he \u201cfound himself outside a parallel process\u201d and had warned others about Giuliani as far back as March. He felt the shadow diplomacy was undermining decades of foreign policy and the rule of law in Ukraine and that was \u201cwrong,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va.\n\nConnolly said Kent described the results of a May 23 meeting at the White House, organized by Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, where three administration officials \u2014 U.S. ambassador Gordon Sondland, special envoy Kurt Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry \u2014 declared themselves the people now responsible for Ukraine policy.\n\n\u201cThey called themselves the three amigos,\u201d Connolly said Kent testified, and they said as much to Zelenskiy in Ukraine when they visited.\n\nKent also told them that Trump, through the Office of Management and Budget, which Mulvaney previously led, was holding up military aid to Ukraine while pressing Zelenskiy to investigate a company linked to Biden\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cHe was clearly bothered by the role Mr. Giuliani was playing,\u201d Connolly said.\n\nIn 10 hours of testimony Monday, Hill, the former White House aide who was a top adviser on Russia, recalled to investigators that Bolton had told her he was not part of \u201cwhatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d an apparent reference to talks over Ukraine.\n\nShe testified that Bolton asked her to take the concerns to National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg.\n\nAs White House lawyers now try to learn more about the handling of the Ukraine call, Eisenberg is coming under particular scrutiny, said one White House official. He was both the official who ordered that the memorandum of the call be moved to a highly-classified system, and the one who involved the Justice Department in a complaint from the CIA general counsel. The latter caught the attention of the president, according to the official.\n\nGiuliani said Tuesday he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in Bolton\u2019s comment. Bolton, Giuliani said, \u201chas been called much worse.\u201d\n\nGiuliani also acknowledged he had received payments totaling $500,000 related to the work for a company operated by Lev Parnas \u2014 who, along with associate Igor Fruman, played a key role in Giuliani\u2019s efforts to launch a Ukrainian corruption investigation against Biden and his son Hunter. The two men were arrested last week on campaign finance charges as they tried to board an international flight.\n\nTrump\u2019s team won\u2019t comply with the Democratic inquiry. Giuliani and Vice President Mike Pence became the latest officials refusing to cooperate, saying through their lawyers they would not provide information requested by House Democrats as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe chairman leading the impeachment investigation, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the stonewalling simply bolsters the charge that Trump is obstructing Congress.\n\n\u201cThe case for Congress continues to build,\u201d Schiff said. He said Defense Secretary Mark Esper told investigators Sunday that he would comply with a subpoena request, only to be \u201ccountermanded\u201d by a higher authority, likely Trump.\n\nSondland, whose text messages with other diplomats are part of a cache released by Volker and made public earlier this month, is scheduled to appear for an interview Thursday.\n\nThe interviews Monday and Tuesday, like the others conducted by House impeachment investigators, took place behind closed doors. Republican lawmakers have aimed their ire at the process, saying witnesses should be interviewed out in the open.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Democrats were trying to \u201ccancel out\u201d Trump\u2019s election with the march toward impeachment.\n\nFive more officials are scheduled this week, mostly from the State Department, though it is unclear if they will all appear.\n\nMichael McKinley, a former top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who resigned last week, is scheduled to testify Wednesday. McKinley, a career foreign service officer and Pompeo\u2019s de facto chief of staff, resigned Friday, ending a 37-year career.\n\nOnce Democrats have completed the probe and followed any other threads it produces, they will use their findings to help determine whether to vote on articles of impeachment.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller, Michael Balsamo, Eric Tucker, Matthew Lee, Padmananda Rama, Andrew Taylor and Alan Fram in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in Dallas contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The impeachment inquiry is revealing vivid new details about the high-level unease over President Donald Trump's actions toward Ukraine,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/160d9f_trump-impeachment-57460-george-kent-deputy-assistant-secretary-state-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
