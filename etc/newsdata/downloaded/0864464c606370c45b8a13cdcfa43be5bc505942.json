EU sets midnight deadline for resolving Irish border issue", "language": "en", "text": "Why will Boris Johnson turn into a pumpkin at the stroke of midnight? The EU\u2019s chief negotiator has set that as a deadline for the British prime minister to offer his concessions on the Irish border in writing. It\u2019s the last minute, almost literally, before the EU meetings that could possibly accept a revamped Brexit deal before the Hallowe\u2019en deadline.\n\nAnd even that might not work if Johnson can\u2019t sell Parliament on the necessary concessions:\n\nMichel Barnier has set Boris Johnson a midnight deadline to concede to EU demands and agree to a customs border in the Irish Sea or be left with nothing to take to the Commons. According to sources, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator told ministers that without a major move there was little prospect of a deal being signed off by leaders at a summit on Thursday, before a special sitting of the UK parliament on Saturday.\n\nDon\u2019t get your hopes up, either. While Johnson has discussed some potential concessions, he\u2019s put nothing in writing yet. Until that happens \u2026\n\nLegal text had yet to be tabled by the British negotiators, Barnier told ministers in Luxembourg. He advised the EU capitals he would announce on Wednesday whether negotiations on an agreement would have to continue into next week. Barnier warned that the starting point for a deal has to be the Northern Ireland-only backstop, keeping it in the EU\u2019s single market for goods and erecting a customs border in the Irish Sea, a proposal previously rejected by Theresa May.\n\nIt\u2019s a proposal that will get immediately rubbished by the DUP too, which is why May had to reject it in the first place. The DUP provides the Tories what little claim they still have to a parliamentary majority, and they have made clear in the past few days that their position has not changed. Northern Ireland has to get treated exactly the same as the rest of the UK or it\u2019s no deal.\n\nStill, hope springs eternal, and Barnier told the media earlier that anything is possible:\n\nVIDEO: The European Union's Brexit negotiator says even if a deal will be difficult, \"it is still possible this week.\" The U.K. Brexit secretary says talks are ongoing and \"we need to give them space to proceed.\" Read the full story here: https://t.co/33A38UzBWe pic.twitter.com/XksFogC9Qj \u2014 AP Europe (@AP_Europe) October 15, 2019\n\nTime is running out, however, and an agreement would need to include the complete legal text \u2014 not just conceptual agreement. That might make this the thirteenth hour more than the eleventh:\n\nA senior German official wouldn\u2019t rule out a Brexit agreement in principle by Wednesday afternoon, but stressed the importance of the specifics \u2014 and how time consuming they will be to work out. \u201cThe basis for our decisions are legal texts in which the details are settled,\u201d the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity in line with department rules, said in Berlin. \u201cBut there has been progress, and as always in these negotiations the biggest progress happens over the final meters.\u201d Late Monday, Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said the British proposals to keep the Irish border protected from smuggling and fraud once it leaves the bloc were insufficient. \u201cThe U.K. proposal contained some steps forward but not enough to guarantee that the internal market will be protected,\u201d Blok said.\n\nWord around the UK campfire will be that Johnson will publish a proposal by tomorrow, and that it will attempt to eat his cake whilst having it too:\n\nIt is understood that the negotiating teams have agreed in principle that there will be a customs border down the Irish Sea. A similar arrangement was rejected by Theresa May as a deal that no British prime minister could accept. Johnson will still have to win over parliament \u2013 including the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and the hardline Tory Brexiters in the European Research Group \u2013 on the basis that, under the deal, Northern Ireland will still legally be within the UK\u2019s customs territory. \u201cNorthern Ireland would de jure be in the UK\u2019s customs territory but de facto in the European Union\u2019s,\u201d one diplomatic source said of the tentative agreement. The prime minister will be able to boast that the UK \u201cwhole and entire\u201d has left the European Union.\n\nThat\u2019s, um, pretty much what the EU offered two years ago. May might have gone for it if she hadn\u2019t gambled on a snap election and wound up in the DUP\u2019s debt. Will the DUP allow Johnson to save face by agreeing to this rhetorical compromise but major functional concession? I\u2019d call it doubtful at best.\n\nFor now, the safe bet is that Johnson turns into a pumpkin at midnight. And then the question becomes whether he can legally cross over the border on Hallowe\u2019en or whether he becomes subject to agricultural inspections.
