Save the GOP for the sake of your party's future.", "language": "en", "text": "The longer Republicans remain silent on how President Trump is abusing the Republican Party, the more it will sound like the silence of the lambs: Our view\n\nIt has long been said that Republicans ought to put country over party and stop defending the indefensible behavior of President Donald Trump.\n\nFor the most part, this argument has fallen on deaf ears for the obvious reason that Trump still enjoys the support of the very same rank-and-file voters whom Republican lawmakers face in primary elections.\n\nA better argument might be that Republicans need to stand up to Trump \u2014 for the sake of their party's future.\n\nGOP abandoning the high ground\n\nSome GOP lawmakers have, to their credit, challenged the president on foreign policy issues such as Russian sanctions and Trump's hasty, ill-conceived decision to withdraw from Syria. But in repeatedly turning a blind eye to his abuses of office, the GOP is branding itself as bankrupt of principle and interested only in clinging to power.\n\nMore ominously, the GOP is turning independent voters against it and abandoning positions \u2014 such as support for law and order, fiscal responsibility, science, free trade, ethics in government and standing up to dictators abroad \u2014 that long formed its political high ground.\n\nFor much of Trump's first 1,000 days in office, a party that supposedly values the rule of law sat by as the president attacked prosecutors and judges who dared to question his actions. More recently, nearly all of its ostrich-like officeholders have put their heads in the sand as Trump used the power and prestige of the United States to pressure Ukraine to investigate a potential general election opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThis is the same party that tried to politicize a tragedy at a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 to make it look like a Hillary Clinton scandal. It is also the party that impeached President Bill Clinton in 1998 after he had an affair with a former White House intern. As the chart below shows, many of the same Republicans who were quick to impeach or convict then are now drooling poodles on Trump's lap.\n\nRNC: The future for Republicans, and America, has never looked brighter\n\nRally on Capitol Hill on Sept. 26, 2019.

Its candidates, moreover, will struggle to articulate what their party stands for:\n\n\u25baFamily values? Not when the president brags of grabbing women and pays hush money to a porn star.\n\n\u25baThe rule of law and constitutional governance? Not when the president misuses his powers for political gain.\n\n\u25baLimited government? Not when the president uses levers of power to go after the head of Amazon, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the state of California, the auto industry, America\u2019s closest allies and many others \u2014 simply because they refuse to carry his water.\n\n\u25baConcern for conflicts of interest? Not when the president selects one his own resorts to host the summit of the Group of Seven major industrial nations. (One can only imagine how Republican politicians and conservative media outlets would have reacted if a Democratic president had done the same.)\n\nTo be sure, Republican lawmakers are politicians who can't ignore their constituents. But they are also the stewards of the GOP\u2019s future who shouldn't be cowering in fear of nasty tweets.\n\nHow is it going to help conservatives get elected if their party has offended large swaths of the electorate? How is toleration for self-dealing and misuse of power going to be a selling point?\n\nAs they contemplate these questions, they might actually find that doing the right thing turns out to be the politically expedient thing.\n\nThen and now: These 27 Republican members of Congress voted to impeach or convict President Bill Clinton\n\nRep.
