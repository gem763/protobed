Israelis began voting Tuesday in an unprecedented repeat election that will decide whether longtime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stays in power despite a looming indictment on corruption charges. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the Israeli election (all times local):\n\n3:45 a.m.\n\nAfter an apparent election setback, Israel's prime minister says he will seek the formation of a new \"Zionist\" government that excludes Arab parties.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu addressed a small crowd of supporters in Tel Aviv at 3:30 a.m. Wednesday, more than five hours after voting ended.\n\nInitial exit polls placed challenger Benny Gantz's Blue and White party just ahead of Netanyahu's Likud, hurting Netanyahu's chances of remaining as prime minister.\n\nExit polls are often imprecise, and Netanyahu said he would wait for official results before making conclusions.\n\nBut he said he would not allow the formation of a new government with Arab partners. He said: \"There will not be and there cannot be a government that leans on Arab, anti-Zionist parties.\"\n\nNetanyahu's campaign repeatedly questioned the loyalty of Israel's Arab citizens.\n\n___\n\n2:45 a.m.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's chief challenger, Benny Gantz, says it is too early to declare a victory in national elections.\n\nExit polls in Tuesday's vote showed Gantz's Blue and White party with a slight lead over Netanyahu's Likud.\n\nNeither party appears to have enough support to form a majority coalition in parliament with their traditional allies, raising the possibility they will have to form a broad unity government.\n\nAddressing supporters in Tel Aviv, Gantz says he will wait for formal results before making any bold pronouncements. But he says he's already begun talking to potential allies. He made no mention of Likud.\n\n\"I am ready to speak to everyone,\" he said.\n\n___\n\n12:30 a.m.\n\nIsrael's election commission says 69.4% of eligible voters cast ballots in unprecedented repeat elections, a slightly larger number than took part in April's vote.\n\nThe commission says 4,440,141 votes were cast by the time polls closed in Tuesday's elections, which were widely seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been in power for more than a decade and faces likely indictment on corruption charges.\n\nInitial exit polls showed Netanyahu did not have enough support to form a right-wing majority coalition, potentially spelling the end of his political career.\n\nTurnout in April's elections was 68.5%. Parliament voted to dissolve itself when Netanyahu was not able to form a majority coalition.\n\n___\n\nMidnight\n\nThe kingmaker in Israel's election says there is only \"one option\" for the country: a unity government between him and the two largest parties.\n\nInitial exit polls published after Tuesday's vote showed the centrist Blue and White Party slightly ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud. But neither appears able to form a majority coalition without the support of Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the midsize Yisrael Beitenu party.\n\nIn a speech to his supporters, Lieberman says the only choice is for the two large parties to join him in a broad, secular coalition that would not be subject to the demands of ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties.\n\nIsraeli polls are often imprecise. But if final results are similar, Lieberman's call would set the stage for complicated negotiations.\n\n___\n\n11:30 p.m.\n\nA senior Palestinian official says he hopes the next Israeli government \"will focus on how to make peace.\"\n\nSaeb Erakat spoke as initial exit polls from Tuesday's vote showed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu falling short of a majority, potentially spelling the end of his decade in power.\n\nIn the closing days of his campaign, Netanyahu had vowed to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank, which Israel seized in the 1967 war and which the Palestinians consider the heartland of their future state.\n\nErakat says Israel \"cannot have peace or security without ending the occupation, without two states, the state of Palestine to live side by side with the state of Israel in peace and security on the 1967 lines.\"\n\nThe peace process broke down shortly after Netanyahu was elected in 2009, and no serious talks have been held since then.\n\n___\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nIsrael's president says he will press party leaders to quickly form a new government after initial exit polls showed no clear winner in parliamentary elections.\n\nReuven Rivlin's office said Tuesday that his nomination of a candidate to form the next government would be guided in part by the need to avoid a third election, after two votes in five months. It said he would meet with party leaders \"after he receives a clear picture of the results, and as soon as possible.\"", "description": "After an apparent election setback, Israel's prime minister says he will seek the formation of a new \"Zionist\" government that excludes Arab parties.
