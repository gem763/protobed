However, OnePlus has just unveiled another phone in the 7T series -- the brand newOnePlus 7T Pro, which is the worthy successor to OnePlus 7 Pro.\n\nI got to play with the smartphone for a few days and this is what I liked and disliked about the OnePlus 7T Pro.\n\nWhat I Liked\n\nDesign\n\nWhen you take the OnePlus 7T Pro in your hand, you won't notice any drastic changes in design. You still get a curved edge to edge display, the same glass sandwich design with aluminium chassis, which still feels amazing. However, now you get a new set of colours for the back. The matte gradient blue on the 7T Pro is slightly lighter than the one on the 7 Pro.\n\nThe camera layout on the back is identical to the OnePlus 7 Pro too. (OnePlus 7 Pro to the left, OnePlus 7T Pro to the right)\n\nDon't Miss 279 SHARES 2.1 K SHARES 827 SHARES 1.8 K SHARES\n\nThe only small change is that OnePlus has placed the laser AF sensor to the left of the camera instead of aligning it between the camera modules.\n\nYou can also opt for the Mclaren Edition of the OnePlus 7T Pro which comes with an all-black design with a sliver wood-like pattern at the back and orange accents to the side. It also comes with a silicon-Alcantara case to go along with it.\n\nDisplay\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we're seeing the same 6.67-inch Fluid Optic AMOLED display with a resolution of 3120x1440 pixels and a 90Hz butter-smooth refresh rate. It looked great on the OnePlus 7 Pro and it still looks stunning on the 7T Pro.\n\nThe colours are nice and poppy with great daylight visibility. The edge-to-edge notch-less design results in an immersive experience like no other phone and looks beautiful.\n\nPerformance\n\nOne of the major changes on the OnePlus 7T Pro is with the hardware under the hood. You're still getting Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855+ octa-core processor, however with 8GB and 12GB RAM variants and 256GB storage. The 12GB variant is being offered in the Mclaren Edition of the OnePlus 7T Pro.\n\nAs expected the phone is blazing fast without any jitters or lags. The high-refresh-rate screen makes the entire experience appear much smoother. Even while gaming, the phone didn't get very hot and it was very comfortable to handle, even under immense loads.\n\nAs far as battery performance is concerned, the device still manages to last a whole day with ease, with at least 35 to 40 percent left. OnePlus's optimisations for switching refresh rate in certain apps really helps in getting decent battery life despite a 90 Hz display.\n\nCamera\n\nOnePlus 7 Pro had an amazing set of cameras and OnePlus has decided to keep that. You get a Sony IMX586 48-megapixel primary shooter, along with a 12-megapixel telephoto shooter and a third 16-megapixel ultra-wide shooter. Even on the 7T Pro, Nightscape mode is available for both ultra-wide and primary camera.\n\nThe camera delivers some bright and crispy shots. The results were very similar to the camera on the OnePlus 7T.\n\nEven the portraits formed a natural-looking bokeh with impressive results.\n\nAt the front, you still get a pop-up 16-megapixel shooter which captures some crisp and bright selfies as well as groupies. It also delivered some crisp low-light images with its Nightscape mode.\n\nThe fall-detection works flawlessly to keep the camera module safe, in case the phone drops while taking photos.\n\nOverall, the camera on the OnePlus 7T Pro will not disappoint.\n\nWhat I Disliked\n\nStill pretty heavy for single-handed use\n\nOne of the only qualms we had with the OnePlus 7 Pro was with the fact that the device was really heavy for single-handed use. And this trait is also followed on to the OnePlus 7T Pro. The 6.67-inch display is obviously massive and it is expected for it to add to the weight of the device. Weighing at 206 grams, OnePlus 7T Pro isn't light, however, its a whole lot lighter than iPhone 11 Pro Max, which weighs a massive 226g.\n\nStill No Wireless Charging\n\nAnother thing that the OnePlus 7T Pro misses on is wireless charging. Targetted as OnePlus's premium flagship, wireless charging is a feature that should have been included in the 7T Pro, to stand tall against its competition. Hopefully, we'll see it on the OnePlus 8.\n\nStill No Headphone Dongle\n\nAnother thing I disliked (which was also seen on the OnePlus 7T) was the fact that OnePlus isn't including a headphone-jack dongle in the box. Even the McLaren Edition doesn't have one.\n\nConclusion: Should you buy the OnePlus 7T Pro?\n\nOnePlus 7T Pro is an amazing phone with a set of features that truly make it stand strong against the competition. And for someone who wants a big-screen smartphone, OnePlus 7T Pro definitely takes the cake here. The curved display does make the phone feel more premium along with a truly notch-less and bezel-less viewing experience.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for the same performance and camera but in a more compact device and don't mind the notch, OnePlus 7T seems like a great deal too. You just won't be able to get the special McLaren Edition in it.", "description": "OnePlus recently shook the smartphone market in India with its OnePlus 7T, which is an amazing phone for the price.
