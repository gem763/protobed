[Photo/China Daily]\n\nWhen trapped in a sealed chamber, what would you do to fight your way through? BMW has the solution. With powerful technologies, the automaker \"saved\" participants from a room escape game, hosted by the automaker, on Friday in Beijing.\n\nThe game participants were required to get through the close siege, but fortunately had the advantage of BMW's innovative technologies to help them along the way.\n\nBy offering this immersive and interactive experience, the German auto giant allows the participants to access its innovations in the field of after sales technologies and services, according to Kang Bo, vice president of Aftersales, BMW Brilliance Automotavie Ltd.\n\n\"Sticking to its customer-centric service concept, BMW after sales service is based on the quality and focuses on the customer demands of 'value, convenience and care'. BMW is committed to further strengthening its innovation in both technology and service, to continue improving customers' after sales service experience and win customers' trust with high-quality services,\" Kang said.\n\nBy applying its innovative advanced technologies, the auto giant hopes to improve the efficiency and accuracy of vehicle diagnosis, maintenance and repair, allowing its customers to enjoy reliable and professional technical services.\n\nThe water paint color photometer is a key device of BMW's after sales paint technicians.\n\nBeing capable of telling the color change of vehicle surface, analyzing particle size and texture details, the device helps paint technicians determine matching colors quickly and accurately, and substantially reduces the risk of color difference after painting.\n\nThe NVH analyzer can collect and analyze the vibration data in the vehicle cabin and engine cabin to detect faults, helping customers save time and costs associated with vehicle maintenance.\n\nThe remote audio and visual augmented reality can transmit technical problems before the frontline maintenance technicians to more experienced BMW technical experts in real time, which allows for remote group consultation and faster elimination of vehicle problems.\n\nBy following up ever-changing customer behaviors and evolving customer psychology, BMW issues a series of after sales services promoting care, quality and convenience, Kang noted.\n\nPaying attention to its rapidly growing used car customers, BMW is now allowing owners who purchase a used BMW car through any channel and that have owned it for more than 100 days access to a raft of BMW's quality after sales services, including a free vehicle inspection and a free oil filter maintenance.\n\nTo further help customers save time and provide convenient service to customers, BMW has launched a 58-minute oil maintenance service.\n\nCustomers can make a reservation through the BMW cloud-connected app, the WeChat official account of BMW customer services and dialing BMW after sales service hotline.\n\nWhen arriving at the shop, customers can enjoy a preferential reception and finish a high-quality oil maintenance and a free vehicle inspection in 58 minutes.\n\nSince it is always the mission of BMW to guarantee the safety for customers, the auto giant has established a top-notch road rescue team that provides customers with round-the-clock rescue services, aiming to guarantee the safety of customers and their vehicles.\n\nCustomers can issue rescue requests through multiple channels such as the vehicle telephone, the after sales hotline and the BMW cloud-connected app.", "description": "When trapped in a sealed chamber, what would you do to fight your way through?
