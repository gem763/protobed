With Rasika, the city\u2019s chief of diplomats sets the gold standard for Indian restaurants not just in Washington, but for the country.\n\nAmy Brandwein: For years, she cooked in the shadow of her mentor, the troubled but talented Roberto Donna of Galileo acclaim. Now, at the neighboring Centrolina and Piccolina in CityCenterDC, she has emerged as one of the Mid-Atlantic\u2019s most visible chefs, and a community-minded entrepreneur whose pantry includes DC Urban Greens, a farm in Washington\u2019s Wards 7 and 8.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDerek Brown: The president of Drink Company, he raised the bar for watering holes everywhere, foremost with the Columbia Room and his rotating pop-up bar, PUB. The author of the recent \u201cSpirits, Sugar, Water, Bitters: How the Cocktail Conquered the World\u201d knows his history, too.\n\nJeff Buben: His late Vidalia was the best Southern restaurant this market had ever seen. The long list of chefs who trained under him \u2014 Cathal Armstrong, Tom Cunanan, Naomi Gallego, Eric Ziebold \u2014 went on to helm some of the area\u2019s most impressive dining destinations.\n\nErik Bruner-Yang: He got the city lining up for ramen outside tiny Toki Underground and went on to open such clever ideas as Maketto, Brothers and Sisters, and Spoken English \u2014 the District\u2019s sole stand-up dining draw \u2014 in the Line hotel.\n\nLisa and Peter Chang: After ditching the Chinese Embassy, they struck out on their own with a string of restaurants in Peter\u2019s name that spoiled us for dry-fried eggplant, scallion pancakes and homestyle Chinese cooking anywhere else. Their latest achievement, Mama Chang in Fairfax, showcases Lisa\u2019s cooking and dishes from the family\u2019s home province of Hubei.\n\nJackie Greenbaum: The former punk rocker\u2019s Day-Glo personality is behind every affordable, off-the-beaten-path restaurant she has brought to life (the much-missed Jackie\u2019s, El Chucho, Bar Charley, Little Coco\u2019s) or resurrected (Quarry House Tavern). Most important to her is that they \u201cring true.\u201d That they do.\n\nMark Furstenberg:He has had several lives in his 81 years \u2014 White House staffer and criminal justice consultant included \u2014 but for those of us who love the staff of life, the creator of Marvelous Market, Breadline and now Bread Furst is destined to be remembered for his baking.\n\nThe Nortons: Launched by Randy Norton more than three decades ago, the family-run Great American Restaurants excels at cooking American food and serving it with a generous side of cheer at 16 restaurants throughout (lucky) Northern Virginia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Obamas: No first couple ate out more, or explored the dining scene in greater depth, than Barack and Michelle. Frequent date nights at trendsetting restaurants might be followed by burgers with the veep or a head of state. And the first lady\u2019s garden and exercise programs kept the citizenry thinking fresh and fit.\n\nPatrick O\u2019Connell: Thanks to the chef who has won just about every major restaurant award out there, notably a rare three stars from the Michelin Guide last year, there\u2019s no more plush or entertaining place to eat in America\u2019s countryside than the Inn at Little Washington. And to think the dream started in a garage.\n\nMichel Richard: Gone but not forgotten, the outsize French talent overcame a childhood that Dickens could have penned to dazzle diners from coast to coast with food as whimsical as it was luscious. Even now, few American chefs\u2019 ideas are more copied than his.\n\nAndy Shallal: The artist-activist\u2019s progressive chainlette of cafes will probably never be awarded a Bib Gourmand from Michelin. But the visionary behind Busboys and Poets knows how to create communities around tables better than most.\n\nFabio and Maria Trabocchi: First with Maestro in Tysons, then with Fiola, Fiola Mare and Sfoglina in Washington, the chef and host with the Midas touch set the standard for Italian cooking, haute and not. Del Mar at the Wharf revealed a chef equally at home with Spanish. As for service, no restaurateurs offer finer.\n\nFor stories, features such as Date Lab, Gene Weingarten and more, visit WP Magazine.\n\nFollow the Magazine on Twitter.\n\nLike us on Facebook.\n\nEmail us at wpmagazine@washpost.com.\n\nAD", "description": "From Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s to the Obamas, they have left their mark on the dining scene.", "authors": ["Tom Sietsema", "Food Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yOztd_YfSSDbYYmHjeCrXc-uFZ0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3SSYMWUULYI6TNLQMQLO7XAIAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
