Re-live all the action below.\n\n80 mins: Cokanasiga takes a Hayward chip in his own 22 and calls the mark, taps and boots the ball into touch. ENGLAND BEAT ITALY 37-0! 74 mins: That was much better stuff from England. Ford whipped a wide pass to Ewels, who fashioned to through another miss pass only to give it to Anthony Watson next to him for the Bath flyer to dance his way over for the fourth try. Farrell converts to build the lead. 37-0 However, there's more concern here as now Sinckler limps off injured, and he's replaced by Joe Marler, who will get a small run-out at tighthead prop. 74 mins: TRY FOR ENGLAND! 73 mins: A slight worry for England here as Luke Cowan-Dickie is going off with what looks a right leg injury, with Jamie George back on. Advertisement 68 mins: England set up the driving maul from the lineout and at the base is Ellis Genge. The prop has many for company as the centre and wings all pile in to help the shove, ensuring that the maul drives over and Genge grounds it for his first England try. Farrell adds the extras. 30-0 68 mins: Italy think they've turned Kvesic over but Canna never released the tackle and England get the penalty. Farrell goes to the corner again... TRY FOR ENGLAND! 65 mins: England manage to get the put-in for the scrum after Braley - back on for Guglielmo Palazzani as the replacement scrum-half is forced off for an HIA - is caught at the base and knocks on. There's a flare up between both sets of forwards that takes a while to simmer down, and when England finally get the ball out they have a penalty advantage for not driving straight. England are on the attack again and Cokanasiga goes close, but the ball doesn't come back and play is pulled back for the penalty. Farrell sends it to touch. 64 mins: England attack again and Curry goes mighty close int he right corner, only for last-gasp Italian defence to stop him. Sinckler then has a smash up the middle before England go wide, but as Ford loses his feet as he flicks it to May the pass goes forward and May's score is quickly chalked off as O'Keefe has called it forwards. Advertisement 60 mins: England get a penalty for offside and there's a bit of a debate over what to do, only for Farrell to finally send it to the corner to the delight of the fans. Can England bag their third try here? 58 mins: The replacements are flowing now as England send on Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Cokanasiga and Matt Kvesic, who three years since his last appearance returns to the international fold. There's not many who though that he would be making his fourth appearance in total when he made his debut six years ago... 57 mins: Youngs gets a rush of blood to the head as he taps and goes following an England penalty, only for his pass to Ford isolating the fly-half that results in him getting held up and Italy turning the ball over. That should have gone to the corner as England really didn't have the numbers to attack quickly. 53 mins: That's a bit more like it! Vunipola psses from the base of the scrum to Youngs who accelrates quickly to the line. With the Italian defence buncing, he misses out Ford and Farrell with a neat pop to Joe Marchant, who has the pace to burn three defenders and score his first international try between the uprights. Farrell converts, and England are now looking comfortable. 23-0 Advertisement 53 mins: \u200bTRY FOR ENGLAND! 50 mins: England will saty that's why you don't turn down the points, as they pinch the lineout and the chance goes begging for Italy. Youngs kicks clear, and Padovani can't take the catch as he knocks on to put England on the counter. They go through the hands but the passing is poor and means that when Watson gets the ball out side, the defence is over to knock him into touch. Fabiani can't keep the lineout straight to give England possession back, and the crowd are just drifting out of this one as the Mexican Wave rears its ugly head. We need a few more tries to keep this interesting really. 48 mins: Italy get a penalty when Sinckler is caught offside chasing Ford's clearing kick, having seen the fly-half charged down seconds before. Italy then get a big cheer whent hey turn down the points and go for touch, and immediately they get a penalty advantage when Ewels enters the maul from the side. Again, Canna kicks to the corner. 44 mins: Genge makes a good run after Marchant's catch, and as the Italian defence try to set themselves, Ben Youngs goes from the base alone and scores next to the ruck. Ben O'Keefe just wants to check there's no knock-on despite Farrell taking a quick drop-goal conversion, but TMO Brian MacNeice confirms it's all ok and the try stands. Farrell eventually converts. 16-0 Advertisement 44 mins: Farrell sends a chip through for May and Hayward to challenge on the deck, and as both slide for it it's the Italian who comes away with the ball for Italy to clear. Farrell then spots Marchant in space and floats a kick-pass out wide to the Harlequins centre, who takes it and tries to barge through Padovani. England recycle the ball...TRY FOR ENGLAND! 42 mins: This time Farrell is off target as he watches the ball drift left of the uprights, and England let points go begging. 41 mins: Italy have made a change in the back-row with Maxime Mbanda on for Jimmy Tuivati, and immediately England win another penalty at the breakdown as Genge gets over the ball. There's more boos as Farrell points to the posts again. 41 mins: ENGLAND GET THE SECOND HALF UNDERWAY!
