Who watches the watchers? A malfunctioning police force has not received the necessary oversight.\n\n\"Those acting for those shamefully and adversely affected by this chain of events need no assistance from me. The home secretary will wish to address these shocking failures.\"\n\nImage copyright PA Media/Getty Images Image caption The searches of the homes of Lord Bramall, Harvey Proctor and Lord Brittan were deemed unlawful\n\nSir Richard said the officers' belief that Beech had \"remained consistent\" in his accounts of sexual abuse was incorrect and that police \"failed to disclose seven factors that undermined Beech's credibility\".\n\nHe added that the IOPC only contacted him after after 20 months, and then told him that two of the five officers under investigation had already been cleared.\n\nThe IOPC continued to investigate three officers, but they retired before it published its findings.\n\nImage caption Sir Richard Henriques has strongly criticised the police watchdog\n\nSir Richard said: \"Whilst I have been treated with the utmost courtesy, I have been alarmed by the [IOPC's] lack of knowledge of relevant criminal procedure.\"\n\nHe added: \"I readily conclude that one or more of the five officers may not have committed misconduct in the application for warrants.\n\n\"However I find it difficult to conceive that no misconduct or criminality was involved by at least one officer.\"\n\nThe IOPC said that its review of the officers' work \"was not a cursory exercise\" and \"independent and impartial\".\n\nA spokesperson said: \"This was a thorough and detailed investigation, reviewing over 1,800 documents, 300 statements gathering 14 independent witness accounts and gaining accounts to three officers who were under investigation.\n\n\"As Sir Richard writes 'no subject should be tried without proper investigation'. And, as he acknowledges in his own review, the IOPC is the right and correct authority to do this. Our investigation was both independent and impartial.\n\n\"To suggest there is no accountability is also wrong. Our report contains 16 learning recommendations that advocate systemic change so this never happens again.\"\n\nThe IOPC's report is due to be published later on Monday.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Met's deputy commissioner Sir Stephen House says he is \"deeply sorry for mistakes made\"\n\nLast week, the Met's deputy commissioner Sir Stephen House said that he was \"deeply, deeply sorry\" for the pain caused by the Met's \"serious mistakes\" during Operation Midland but that the force did not accept everything in Sir Richard's report.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has ordered an inspection by the chief inspector of constabulary, following Sir Richard's review.", "description": "A retired judge says the police watchdog's review of an inquiry into bogus abuse claims was 'flawed'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14DC9/production/_107994458_carlbeech_index_policeho.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
