The coverage of Meghan, particularly by the British tabloids, has been routinely mean-spirited and racially charged, so much so that, early in their relationship, Harry issued an appeal imploring them to end \u201cthe wave of abuse and harassment.\u201d The Daily Mail and its ilk persisted, attacking everything from Meghan\u2019s mother to her clothing, and have repeatedly run coverage sympathizing with her estranged relatives (namely, Thomas and Samantha Markle), who publicly slandered the Duchess throughout her engagement and wedding.\n\nEarlier this year, Oprah Winfrey (a friend of Meghan\u2019s) said she avoids reading any of the coverage, and Meghan herself has never addressed it in public. In his statement, Harry noted that he\u2019s wary that Meghan\u2019s treatment is mirroring that of his mother\u2019s, the late Princess Diana:\n\n\u201cThere comes a point when the only thing to do is to stand up to this behavior because it destroys people and destroys lives. Put simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isn\u2019t acceptable at any level. We won\u2019t and can\u2019t believe in a world where there is no accountability for this.\n\n\u201cThough this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one, because my deepest fear is history repeating itself. I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother, and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\n\n\u201cWe thank you, the public, for your continued support. It is hugely appreciated. Although it may not seem like it, we really need it.\u201d", "description": "A statement from Prince Harry reveals that Meghan Markle is filing a claim against the British tabloid the Daily Mail.", "authors": ["Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/10/01/1-prince-harry-meghan-markle.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
