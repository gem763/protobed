Bulgarian authorities originally estimated the findings of a report would be released last Friday, but coroners have told Telegraph Sport it could take another six weeks for a toxicology report to be completed.", "description": "The body of the football supporter who died in Bulgaria has finally been returned to England, but the family of Rob Spray still face a frustrating wait as they attempt to get answers over the circumstances behind his death.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Alan Tyers", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000213315145-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BquzpisnmFqEW6Wcql0vpOPCCtHY2V1rTZli3ourQTraM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
