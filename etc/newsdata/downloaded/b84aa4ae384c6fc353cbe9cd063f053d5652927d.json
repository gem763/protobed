When Marita Koch stopped the clock in the women\u2019s 400 metres at 47.60 sec, at a World Cup event in Canberra 34 years ago, all but one of her opponents had vanished from the TV picture. Jarmila Kratochvilova, the previous world record-holder from Czechoslovakia, was almost 3\u00bd seconds back down the track. That Koch produced such a time from an inside lane, and with less-than-textbook form, merely magnified the incredulity.\n\nKoch\u2019s feat coincided with an era of rampant doping in her native East Germany, and her name later appeared in a letter in the Stasi files, protesting about a team-mate receiving a higher dose of Oral-Turinabol, the regime\u2019s go-to drug. But she never failed a drug test during her career and has insisted that she has a clear conscience.\n\nEver since that day, Koch\u2019s time has been a taunting throwback for her successors, a target that they can marvel at but not even dream of emulating. That is, until 21-year-old Salwa Eid Naser, born in Nigeria but now a naturalised Bahraini, streaked to a stunning 48.14 sec here in Doha and blew the possibilities over one lap apart. The result, representing an improvement of almost a second on her personal best, was the most astonishing moment of these championships.", "description": "It has long stood among the most daunting records in the book.", "authors": ["Oliver Brown", "Chief Sports Feature Writer", "Jim White"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/athletics/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000211953463-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwRMWbYwzrg_3PLcMwCu9G8U.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
