Some Ukrainian Americans Welcome the Change.", "language": "en", "text": "Bohdan Czmola, whose parents immigrated to the United States from Ukraine, before the Ukrainian Film Festival at the University of Pittsburgh, Sept. 28, 2019. (Maddie McGarvey/The New York Times)\n\nPITTSBURGH \u2014 Bohdan Czmola kicked off the Ukrainian Film Festival on Saturday night with a topical opener: \u201cHas anybody been watching the news this week?\u201d\n\nAfter years of being largely overlooked in the United States, Ukraine, the country of Czmola\u2019s parents, was suddenly in the middle of a blockbuster news story. It has been in more headlines in the space of a few days than Czmola remembers in all of his 68 years.\n\n\u201cUkraine,\u201d Czmola declared, like a proud father, to the 30 or so people in the auditorium, \u201cis the hot topic of discussion.\u201d\n\nMost of the time, all that Americans typically know about Ukraine is \u2014 maybe \u2014 the food and music, lamented Czmola and others, sitting in the auditorium before the first film of the night. Some might have paid a little attention during the recent revolutions, or were aware that a war is going on in eastern Ukraine in which 13,000 people have been killed. The crowd bristled that people still seemed to associate Ukraine with tsarist pogroms, pointing out that its voters had recently elected a Jewish comedian as president.\n\nMaddeningly to many with Ukrainian heritage, pundits on TV even occasionally say \u201cthe Ukraine,\u201d as if it were still just another region of the Russian empire.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t say the France or the Spain,\u201d muttered Paul Gerlach, the president of the Ukrainian Community of Western Pennsylvania, which had organized the film festival.\n\nBut suddenly the news broke that President Donald Trump, in a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, had pushed for an investigation into the Biden family, and Ukraine was the only thing anyone on the news was talking about. It might be bad news for Trump, or Joe Biden, or Rudy Giuliani. But for Ukraine?\n\nWhile many analysts see multiple downsides for Ukraine in these developments, Czmola didn\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s extremely positive,\u201d he declared. \u201cThe more news about Ukraine the better.\u201d\n\nTo clarify: Few in the audience thought this would end badly for Trump. In interview after interview, people saw the whole thing as cooked up by Democrats and in fact revealing much more about the unsavoriness of the Biden family. The Ukrainian-American diaspora here, at least among the largely middle-aged people who go to film festivals, was solid Trump country.\n\n\u201cThis president is wonderful,\u201d said Hanna Dziamko, 48, a pharmacist who immigrated to the United States in 1997. \u201cEverything he does is just unbelievable, everything he touches is successful.\u201d\n\nThis affection is driven in part by what they see as an unforgivably feeble response by the Obama administration to Russian intrusion into Ukraine. Trump may have delayed sending military aid to Ukraine \u2014 a delay at the heart of the scandal \u2014 but unlike his predecessor, he had agreed to provide Ukraine with arms.\n\nMore fundamentally, many hold a deep distrust, shared by immigrants from other communist or formerly communist countries like Cuba or Vietnam, for anyone with even the slightest good word to say about socialism or anything like it.\n\n\u201cWe had eight years of Obama taking us back to socialism,\u201d Dziamko said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it.\u201d\n\nThe contempt for socialism is interwoven with a contempt for Russian domination, which at the current moment means a furious loathing of President Vladimir Putin. So the question presents itself: What of Trump\u2019s fond words for Putin, his desire to bring Russia back into the Group of 7, his associates\u2019 tendency to work for Kremlin interests, his expressed wish that the president of Ukraine \u201cget together\u201d with Putin?\n\nSome of this is indeed hard to make sense of, several said. But, they cautioned, it is important to understand that Trump deals in long-game strategy.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing, it might look bad for Ukraine today, but it\u2019s going to look great for Ukraine in a year,\u201d said George Honchar, a semiretired agronomist whose front porch doormat has a picture of Putin\u2019s face on it, along with an invitation in Ukrainian to wipe your feet.\n\nWhat all this could do for Ukraine\u2019s profile here in the United States, he said, that was the thing to focus on.\n\n\u201cAfter what happened this week, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that we'll see more kids in our Ukrainian school, from parents who might have been ashamed of their roots,\u201d he said on Friday night at the Ukrainian American Citizens Club, a smoky bar and meeting hall in the Pittsburgh suburb of Carnegie. \u201cThis gives them pride, or it should! And if it doesn\u2019t, they\u2019re fools.\u201d", "description": "PITTSBURGH -- Bohdan Czmola kicked off the Ukrainian Film Festival on Saturday night with a topical opener: \"Has anybody been watching the news this week?\"After years of being largely overlooked in the United States, Ukraine, the country of Czmola's parents, was suddenly in the middle of", "authors": ["Campbell Robertson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cBvXT5hZXqybez00vBmFWA--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/66f50b1efb076b134843112e0389e6d3", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
