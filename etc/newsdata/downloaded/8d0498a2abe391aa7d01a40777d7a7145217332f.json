The campaign will kick off with a Times Square billboard, unveiling a series of photographs that capture the raw, unedited reactions of young children of Citi employees at the precise moment they learn about the gender pay gap and unequal opportunities that persist across many industries. The campaign will direct consumers to view the full video on Citi\u2019s website, which showcases the children\u2019s reactions in real-time. The compelling content is intended to serve as the spark to ignite a broader conversation about the issue amongst adults and the next generation.\n\nThis campaign represents the next step in Citi\u2019s dedication to close its gender pay gap. Through this series of compelling visuals, Citi is shining a light on pay equity and representation within its organization and hopes that its commitment will have a significant effect across industries and geographic boundaries.\n\nEarlier this year, Citi became the first U.S. company to publish unadjusted or \u201craw\u201d pay gap figures for women and U.S. minorities. This figure measures the difference in median total compensation when adjustments are not made for factors such as job function, level or geography. The analysis revealed that the median pay for women globally is 71 percent of the median for men, and the median pay for U.S. minorities is 93 percent of the median for non-minorities. To effectively reduce the difference in the raw pay gap, Citi has announced goals to increase the representation of women and U.S. minorities in senior and higher-paying roles across the firm. Women make up more than half of Citi\u2019s workforce globally, however, only 37 percent of the firm\u2019s senior-most positions are held by women. Citi has pledged to increase representation at the Assistant Vice President through Managing Director levels to at least 40 percent for women globally and 8 percent for Black employees in the U.S. by 2021.\n\n\u201cWith this new campaign, we hope to shine a light on the unfiltered reactions of children to this persistent issue and inspire a broader conversation around pay equity and the representation gaps,\u201d says Carla Hassan, Global Chief Brand Officer at Citi. \u201cThe Moment is intended to fuel the powerful emotions that are needed to spur action amongst adults as well as showcase how to communicate with and empower future generations.\u201d\n\nAs part of the campaign and in celebration of International Day of the Girl (October 11), today Citi will unveil a billboard featuring photographs from the campaign in the heart of Times Square, located at 1535 Broadway between 45th and 46th Streets above the Marriot Marquis. Created by Publicis North America and directed and photographed by Kelia Anne MacCluskey, the photos will be featured on the billboard over the next four weeks. Additionally, the advertisements will be featured in print in the Los Angeles Times, New York Times and Washington Post, while also running digitally on LATimes.com and across Citi\u2019s social media channels using the hashtag #itsabouttime.\n\n\u201cCiti\u2019s willingness to be transparent on the pay equity and representation issue is what holds us accountable for making progress,\u201d says Sara Wechter, Head of Human Resources at Citi. \u201cCiti is committed to ensuring equal pay for equal work for all of our colleagues globally and we are working diligently to close the female and minority representation gaps across our firm.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Citi\u2019s The Moment campaign and to view the video, please visit www.citi.com/itsabouttime.\n\nAbout Citi\n\nCiti, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
