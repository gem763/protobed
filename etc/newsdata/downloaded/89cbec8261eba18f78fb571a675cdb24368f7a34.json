I Feel Empathy For Him\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "There were moments during his nearly three-year banishment from television, when Billy Bush felt the lowest he has ever felt.\n\n\u201cSuicidal thoughts pop into your head,\u201d Bush told The Daily Beast\u2014a raw revelation from a man whose life and career, by all outward appearances, had been charmed by privilege and good fortune until things abruptly fell apart in October 2016 when he was fired from NBC's Today show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never seriously do it\u2014because I have children that matter. But when you\u2019re really low\u2014and this is important to include\u2014you\u2019re emoting at the most extreme,\u201d Bush continued. \u201cBut I\u2019m never ever a serious candidate for that. I would not, could not do that to those who count on me and love me and need me. Absolutely not.\n\n\u201cBut you think, \u2018Oh, I would do it!\u2019 No, no you won\u2019t. But you\u2019re upset. Look, everybody has something. Everybody has something that is really, really deeply upsetting. And if you haven\u2019t, you will. That\u2019s for sure. And I may have something again. I hope I\u2019m conditioned to take a deep breath, acknowledge the feelings, and know that they\u2019re not here to stay.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of his sacking by NBC, Bush said, he self-medicated with alcohol, although he\u2019d never previously had a drinking problem. \u201cYeah, at the beginning, it was numb, numb, numb,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out life, and I think I\u2019ve gotten pretty close\u2014that life is lived in the middle. I have been really high in life, and I\u2019ve been really low now. Really low\u2014like all the way low.\n\n\u201cI was at a moment this past Christmas where I was feeling quite lost and abandoned,\u201d Bush said. \u201cKinda like, \u2018Where\u2019s my industry? Where\u2019s my life? What am I doing here?\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was Christmas Eve. And I ended up reading a book called The Purpose of Christmas by [megachurch pastor] Rick Warren. And I felt this unbelievably overpowering presence come over me,\u201d Bush recounted. \u201cAnd it took me from the deepest feelings of despair to a warm glow of everything\u2019s gonna be just fine. A very powerful moment. And I won\u2019t forget it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cthe negative feelings and the depression feelings don\u2019t go away,\u201d Bush said. \u201cBut you can get through them and recover from the episodes quicker.\u201d\n\nThe 47-year-old Bush\u2014looking tan and rested\u2014confided his extreme despair this week while nursing a tequila cocktail at a rooftop hotel bar in Manhattan and celebrating next Monday\u2019s premiere of his brand new anchoring gig on the Fox Television entertainment show Extra.\n\nIt\u2019s the first job he\u2019s had since his life imploded on Oct. 7, 2016, when a 2005 outtake surfaced of Bush, then the 33-year-old co-host of Access Hollywood and the father of three daughters, laughing along\u2014and worse\u2014as then-Apprentice star Donald Trump let fly with a creepy, misogynistic rant.\n\n\u201cSheesh, your girl\u2019s hot as shit!\u201d Bush bantered with Trump on the Access Hollywood bus 14 years ago as he spotted Days of Our Lives star Arianne Zucker, with whom the reality TV mogul was scheduled to make a cameo appearance. \u201cYes! The Donald has scored!\u201d\n\nTrump then remarked that he needed some Tic-Tacs, \u201cjust in case I start kissing her\u2026 When you\u2019re a star, they let you do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d Bush agreed.\n\n\u201cGrab \u2019em by the pussy,\u201d Trump infamously added, to general hilarity from Bush and members of the Access Hollywood crew. \u201cYou can do anything.\u201d\n\nShockingly, Trump went on to win the presidency a few weeks after the outtake turned up; despite increasingly abject public apologies, Bush was promptly fired from his dream job cohosting the 9 a.m. third hour of the Today show\u2014a position he\u2019d held for less than two months.\n\nAfter waiting seven months, during which he avoided publicity and kept his own counsel, Bush attempted to rehabilitate his public image with sympathy-generating interviews with The Hollywood Reporter and Good Morning America\u2019s Robin Roberts on ABC, and seven months after that, a soul-baring New York Times op-ed along with an appearance on Stephen Colbert\u2019s Late Show on CBS.\n\nBush said his emerging post-catastrophe public profile was less a calculated PR strategy than \u201can eagerness to say something at some point.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOf course underneath it all you want to get back to working and living, and you want to be understood\u2026 You want to communicate and let people see your heart. I think people know the kind of person I am. I\u2019m happy with the way I handled myself publicly\u2014which was not very much. I popped up here and there. When it was time, it was time.\u201d\n\nYet he continued to languish in unemployed exile. Discussions with the Daily Mail to host the British tabloid\u2019s gossipy television show came to naught when Bush decided that a down-market TV gig would do little for his reputation.\n\nThe decision of NBC News chairman Andy Lack and Today executive producer (now NBC News president) Noah Oppenheim to sack him was looking increasingly like a career-ender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scary time. People are walking through landmines everywhere,\u201d Bush said, by way of explaining why he found it so difficult to find gainful employment.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s a snapshot. It\u2019s not the whole man. It\u2019s a snapshot of something that was there. And I reacted the same way others did. I didn\u2019t like it\u2026It was a bad moment in life. And I owned it and paid heavily for it \u201d\n\nThe nephew of one American president, the late George H.W. Bush, and the first cousin of another, George W. Bush, he\u2019s the son of Bush 41\u2019s younger brother, 88-year-old financier Jonathan Bush.\n\nYet his brash, occasionally abrasive TV persona\u2014as when he and his Today cohost Al Roker engaged in an uncomfortably antagonistic August 2016 debate in Rio concerning the lies of disgraced Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte\u2014is the polar opposite of WASPy politesse. The image of an entitled, arrogant frat-boy, and a crudely sexist one at that, has continued to dog him.\n\nBush seems to understand why.\n\n\u201cI felt the same things [as his detractors] when I watched that,\u201d he said of the notorious Access Hollywood outtake. \u201cIt was a gut-punch, because I didn\u2019t like what I saw.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a snapshot. It\u2019s not the whole man. It\u2019s a snapshot of something that was there. And I reacted the same way others did. I didn\u2019t like it\u2026 It was a bad moment in life. And I owned it and paid heavily for it.\n\n\u201cBut I think I\u2019m an improved person, because that\u2019s what adversity does to a human being. These are character-building moments\u2026 I have extracted the good out of it. I didn\u2019t miss the opportunity.\u201d\n\nBush said he feels empathy for Al Franken, who quit the Senate last year after Democratic colleagues, led by New York\u2019s Kirsten Gillibrand, demanded his resignation amid allegations of unwanted touching by multiple women\u2014allegations partly called into question by a recent profile of Franken in the New Yorker.\n\n\u201cI think Al Franken was sacrificed,\u201d Bush said, adding that he has never met the former Saturday Night Live performer and writer. \u201cBut I think that was more about politics. That was more about a different Senate seat\u201d\u2014the Alabama special election between Democrat Doug Jones and his Republican opponent, credibly accused pedophile Roy Moore.\n\n\u201cThey had to reach for that moral high ground. The fact is that there aren\u2019t very many people out there, in my opinion, in politics or entertainment or anywhere that can claim the moral high ground.\u201d\n\nBush sees parallels between himself and Franken. \u201cI feel empathy for him because I think it was handled very quickly and rushed, and I know that there was a larger purpose\u201d\u2014in Bush\u2019s case, as he would have it, the protection of NBC News\u2019 most profitable franchise from unwanted controversy in the polarized environment of a bitter presidential campaign.\n\nAlong with everything else, Bush was grappling with a divorce from his wife of 21 years, Sydney\u2014which he described as an \u201camicable\u201d parting unrelated to the Trump incident and its aftermath.\n\n\u201cI love and respect her very much, and she was very supportive through the sacking,\u201d Bush said, adding that he\u2019s single and not dating seriously. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for what [New York Times columnist] David Brooks, in his book The Second Mountain, calls the \u2018rapturous love.\u2019 You see somebody and you know instantly. Lightning bolts!\u201d\n\n\u201c So, people live in a perpetual state of fear, and what we create ultimately is a society of liars, or people who are afraid to be honest and tell the truth, because somebody\u2019s always ready to weaponize \u201d\n\nThree years after he trended on Twitter, Bush inveighs against what he calls \u201cthe outrage and faux outrage culture\u201d that has invaded the media landscape.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for little things as we talk to people: \u2018Ah! There might be a place to exploit some controversy that can get a bunch of clicks and page views!\u2019 And usually, it ruins people\u2019s lives because then people get on social media and \u2018Cancel Culture\u2019 begins and they attack. And corporations aren\u2019t strong enough to stand behind their people. So, people live in a perpetual state of fear, and what we create ultimately is a society of liars, or people who are afraid to be honest and tell the truth, because somebody\u2019s always ready to weaponize.\u201d\n\nBush said he plans to address his ugly encounter with the future president during Monday\u2019s Extra debut\u2014both in the final segment of the half-hour program and a mid-show segment featuring a guest he coyly declined to identify.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s a good booking, and it could be fun, it could be self-deprecating, and it could be interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was determined to make some lemonade out of lemons\u201d\n\nBush said he has made a special effort to use his hiatus to spend quality time with each of his three daughters aged 15, 18 and 21.\n\n\u201cI was determined to make some lemonade out of lemons,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t all be pitying myself and working through my own issues. So I took each girl on a dad-daughter mano a mano trip\u2014one to Budapest, France and Japan for each kid. And it was amazing just to be alone with them and find our way through our GPS maps and stay in little hotels and go see different things.\u201d (In Budapest this summer, Bush said, he had a friendly encounter in the hotel gym with Scarlett Johansson, who paused her exercise routine to come up and say hello when he was using a treadmill.)\n\nAs for how their father\u2019s public firing, humiliation and lengthy unemployment has affected Bush\u2019s daughters, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014they\u2019re resilient kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThey get love from both of their parents. I think they\u2019re just fine, honestly.\u201d\n\nAfter the Access Hollywood tape was released, Bush\u2019s middle daughter, in tears, asked him why he was laughing at and encouraging Trump\u2019s misogynistic repartee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Bush said he finally responded after she refused to accept his various quibbling explanations.\n\n\u201cYou have to own it,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWhen something private and not flattering comes out, they don\u2019t want to hear you explain around it. They see what they see.\u201d\n\nHis eldest daughter, meanwhile, \u201cis in recovery\u201d from substance abuse problems that cropped up years before the Access Hollywood tape, said Bush, who joined this daughter for her 18th birthday in getting a tiny cross tattoo on his left wrist\u2014a symbol of faith and sobriety.\n\nOf the #MeToo movement, Bush said, \u201cI think it\u2019s a great movement. I think there\u2019s tremendous integrity at the core of it and it\u2019s tackling evils. I support it, and I\u2019ve got three girls and I think they would agree with that. We\u2019ve talked about it.\u201d (Bush\u2019s friends point out that while the Access Hollywood tape was bad, no stories about workplace misconduct, sexual or otherwise, have emerged since its release.)\n\nBy the time the tape leaked, \u201cI was already a changed person,\u201d Bush said. \u201cKeep in mind, I was fired in 2016 for a bad moment in 2005. I was already a different human being. When judgment day came, it was not about me. It was supposed to be judgment day for someone else\u201d\u2014namely Trump.\n\nPressed repeatedly during the interview, Bush refused to share his feelings on the record about whether Trump is fit for office; a registered independent, he said he doesn\u2019t want to engage in political chatter beyond saying \u201cI\u2019m not thrilled with either side.\u201d\n\nProbably equally salient, he doesn\u2019t wish to alienate whatever percentage of potential Extra viewers who still count themselves among Trump\u2019s fans. Yet all indications point to Bush\u2019s disdain for the 45th president and his wish for him to make a quick exit from the White House.\n\nIn his Times op-ed, Bush wrote that after Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015, \u201cI was highly critical of the idea of a Trump presidency. The man who once told me\u2014ironically, in another off-camera conversation\u2014after I called him out for inflating his ratings: \u2018People will just believe you. You just tell them and they believe you,\u2019 was, I thought, not a good choice to lead our country.\u201d\n\nBush told The Daily Beast that he\u2019s had zero contact with Trump, the president\u2019s representatives or members of his family since the October 2016 incident.\n\nBush said he had a friendly phone conversation with NBC Universal chief executive Steve Burke several months after his firing, but he\u2019s unlikely to have similarly warm encounters with Andy Lack or Noah Oppenheim or, for that matter, Al Roker.\n\n\u201c If you\u2019re bitter in one little area, it infects everything. It\u2019s too much of a virus. So you have to. And I\u2019ve done all that. I\u2019m looking at going forward and doing a good show and making a living again \u201d\n\nIn his New York Times op-ed, Bush wrote about his feelings of \u201canger\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d; after NBC offered him a low-ball severance package, Bush hired a litigator to fight his former bosses, and managed to get somewhere in the neighborhood of $4 million. Yet Bush insists he\u2019s not bitter.\n\n\u201cForgiveness is about you,\u201d he said, when asked if he\u2019s forgiven the NBC News brass for what he considered their betrayal. \u201cYou can\u2019t be bitter in just one area of your life and not be bitter anywhere else. \u2018I\u2019m only bitter here.\u2019 No. If you\u2019re bitter in one little area, it infects everything. It\u2019s too much of a virus. So you have to. And I\u2019ve done all that. I\u2019m looking at going forward and doing a good show and making a living again.\u201d\n\nBush described the new Extra, of which he is anchor and managing editor, as a departure form the run-of-the-mill entertainment news and feature show. Instead of packaged pieces introduced from the anchor desk, it will focus on the behind-the-scenes process of celebrity journalism. Bush will be followed by cameras all day long as the show comes together.\n\nAt a small cocktail party Wednesday night at the Hudson Yards headquarters of Warner Media, which is producing the new Extra, Bush told revelers, including several journalists, that he\u2019s a different person from three years ago.\n\n\u201cI care about people\u2019s well-being. The empathy is there,\u201d he said about his enforced \u201cvacation.\u201d \u201cI picked up a couple of missing things\u2014a missing couple of tools from the toolbox that complete me.\u201d\n\nHe added, concerning his Trump misadventure: \u201cYou can ask me anything. Ask me about the bus\u2014until Monday. After that, I\u2019ll never speak of it again.\u201d\n\nIf you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741", "description": "In a candid interview with Lloyd Grove, Billy Bush opens up about #MeToo, Al Franken, Donald Trump, his \u2018suicidal thoughts\u2019 after being fired by NBC\u2014and his return to TV.", "authors": ["Lloyd Grove", "Editor At Large"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567724370/190904-grove-billy-bush-tease_eqou3z", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
