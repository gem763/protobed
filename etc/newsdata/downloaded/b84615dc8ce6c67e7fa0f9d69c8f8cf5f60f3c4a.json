And last summer, JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> also began offering free stock trades for self-managed accounts through its mobile banking app.\n\n\"Stocks commissions long ago stopped being a primary revenue item for Schwab, dropping to 8% of revenues last year and currently under 5%. Net interest income from customer deposits and asset management fees are far more important,\" added Biggar in an email to Reuters.\n\nSchwab made $139 million from selling its customers' orders in 2018, up 22% from the previous year, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nTD Ameritrade was paid $458 million for customer orders in its last fiscal year, up from $320 million the year before, according to a filing.\n\nSchwab will reduce the commission to zero from $4.95 per trade, starting Oct. 7, the company said.\n\nThe company reported an 8% year-on-year jump in second-quarter net income at $937 million.\n\nSchwab managed total client assets of $3.75 trillion, as of July end.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by C Nivedita in Bengaluru and John McCrank in New York ; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)", "description": "Schwab's latest move is likely to have a knock-on effect across the sector, forcing rivals to follow suit and eliminate commissions, experts warned.
