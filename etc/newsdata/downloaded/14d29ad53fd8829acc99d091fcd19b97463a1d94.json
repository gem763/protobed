Gorsuch said he and his colleagues sing happy birthday to each other, grill burgers at employee picnics and play practical jokes.\n\n\"That's the Supreme Court I know,\" he said.\n\nOfficials say the Supreme Court's justices rule unanimously in 40% of the 70 cases they hear in an October-to-May term.\n\nGorsuch says he is concerned about the deterioration of civic education. He said only about one-third of millennials think it's important to live in a democracy.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
