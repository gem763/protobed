He said the tax cut would be \u201cvery, very inspirational\u201d without providing details.\n\nTrump spoke a day after deciding against cutting the tax on capital gains by indexing gains to inflation. That decision was announced late Wednesday after a meeting earlier between the president and his economic advisers, who discussed whether to move ahead with the tax break.\n\nThe administration has also put off the idea of a possible cut in payroll taxes, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC earlier Thursday. Mnuchin said that Trump was focused instead on a second round of proposed tax cuts.\n\nBut a Trump-backed tax cut would face an a near-impossible battle in Congress in advance of the 2020 elections. Constitutionally, tax legislation must originate in the House, which Democrats currently control. They are unlikely to back any legislation that could give Trump a victory during the presidential election campaign.\n\nKey Democrats in Congress, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, have said they could consider cuts to levies on the middle class, but those cuts would have to be offset with higher taxes on the wealthy.\n\nThat trade-off -- if Trump and Democrats could compromise -- could cause no-new-tax Republicans to balk, making agreement nearly impossible in a divided government.\n\nTrump last month floated the idea of indexing capital gains to inflation or cutting payroll taxes as a way to jolt the U.S. economy, which has shown warning signs of a slowdown. But he later said that cutting capital gains taxes would be seen as \u201csomewhat elitist\u201d because it would benefit the wealthy.\n\nMost of the benefits of indexing would go to high-income households, with the top 1% receiving 86% of the benefit, according to estimates in 2018 by the Penn Wharton Budget Model. The policy could reduce tax revenue by $102 billion over a decade, the model found.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the White House has floated a tax cut when facing political headwinds. Last fall, ahead of the midterms where Republicans ultimately lost their majority in the House, Trump suggested he would cut taxes for middle-earners by 10%.\n\nThe tax cut announcement came as a surprise to administration officials and Trump\u2019s allies in Congress. That plan was never released.\n\nAgain in August, Trump said \u201ca lot of people\u201d would like a cut in payroll taxes, but then said that a reduction isn\u2019t needed. A day later, he said he was still open to a payroll tax break and cutting taxes for investors by indexing capital gains taxes to inflation, a move some of his advisers think he could do without Congress.\n\nAnd late in 2017, as the Republican tax overhaul was taking shape and criticism arose that it would favor the wealthy and corporations, Trump promised relief for the middle class. But that did not make it into the final legislation.\n\n(Updates with prospects for new tax cut in Congress, starting in fifth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jordan Fabian in Washington at jfabian6@bloomberg.net;Laura Davison in Washington at ldavison4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, John Harney, Justin Blum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said Thursday that he\u2019s planning a tax cut directed at the middle class that will be announced in the next year.\u201cIt will be a very substantial tax cut,\u201d Trump told congressional Republicans at a retreat in Baltimore.
