The story of the day is furniture tossed into a pool.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nBrown gave a deposition Tuesday concerning an April 24, 2018 incident in which furniture from his condominium at The Mansions at Acqualina in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, was apparently heaved out the window. Video of what happened surfaced Tuesday on Fox affiliate WSVN.\n\nWalking with reporters on Tuesday morning, Brown didn\u2019t say much when he was asked about the deposition.\n\n\u201cIt was alright,\u201d Brown said in video shot by TMZ. \u201cYou know it was alright.\u201d\n\nThe furniture incident is the latest controversy surrounding Brown, who has been embroiled in near daily issues away from the football field. According to TMZ, Brown has denied the claims and in fact, is counter-suing the condominium complex for lack of security. He\u2019s claiming that there was a burglary at his residence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps most worrisome about the whole incident is the presence of a little child in the pool area, who was nearly hit by the furniture.\n\nThe lawsuit claims $35,000 in damages to the condo unit by Brown, who began to rent there in February.\n\nAs for the sexual misconduct claims, they have yet to be resolved. An artist who spoke to Sports Illustrated recently on condition of anonymity said Brown exposed himself to her in 2017 after hiring her to paint a mural in his Pittsburgh-area home. The allegation surfaced just days after another woman, Brown\u2019s former personal trainer, filed a civil lawsuit accusing him of sexual assault and rape during a series of incidents that occurred in 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe Patriots were the third team in seven months to tire of the off-field behavior that has overshadowed Brown's accomplishments as one of the NFL\u2019s most prolific receivers for a decade.\n\nA four-time All-Pro who caught 837 passes over nine seasons with the Steelers, Brown wore out his welcome in Pittsburgh after he went missing for two days before the 2018 season finale.\n\nThe Steelers traded him to Oakland, which signed him to a contract that would have paid him up to $50 million over the next three seasons. He never played a game for the team, quarreling with the coach and general manager until they, too, released him.\n\nMore on Fox Business", "description": "Antonio Brown is back in the news again, this time for a deposition involving an incident last year where furniture was tossed from his Florida condo.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/04/0/0/Antonio-Brown.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
