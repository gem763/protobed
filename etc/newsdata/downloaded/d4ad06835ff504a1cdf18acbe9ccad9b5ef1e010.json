It collected 51.6% of Osram shares, including its own nearly 20% stake, falling short of the required 62.5%. However, it vowed to pursue the acquisition.\n\nSwiss-listed AMS, best known for supplying Apple (O: ) with sensors for iPhones, wants to expand in the auto industry and supply sensors and lighting systems for self-driving cars to reduce its dependence on smartphone producers.\n\nAMS had sweetened its bid to the current 41 euros a share after private equity groups Bain Capital and Advent said they were prepared to trump the Austrian group's initial offer of 38.50 euros.\n\nBain and Advent informed Osram on Friday that they would refrain from a takeover bid for the time being, the German company said at the time.\n\nSources familiar with the buyout groups' thinking told Reuters on Sunday that the investors were waiting in the wings possibly to revive their approach if AMS' bid failed.\n\nAMS said on a website set up to inform on its bid that talks with Osram management on the new offer were underway.", "description": "Osram labour reps reaffirm opposition to AMS takeover offer", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9J0EN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
