It was chartered from Montreal-based airline Air Transat.\n\nThe Liberal party says it is buying carbon offsets for the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the prime minister's flights.\n\nJournalist Robert Fife pointed out on Twitter this is not the first time a campaign plane had a bus collision mishap in Canada - something similar happened to Mr Trudeau's father, former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, 39 years ago.\n\nBritish Columbia is expected to be a fierce battleground for multiple political parties, and the Liberals are fighting to hold on to their 17 seats there.\n\nMr Trudeau is seeking a second term in office after winning a majority government in the 2015 Canadian general election.\n\nBoth the Liberals and the Conservatives have campaign planes with the names of their leaders - Mr Trudeau and Andrew Scheer, respectively - emblazoned on the fuselage.\n\nMr Trudeau wasn't the only leader whose campaign faced transportation problems on the first day.\n\nMr Scheer's plane took off for a rally in the province of Quebec on Wednesday morning only to be diverted by fog.\n\nJournalists and campaign staff were forced to travel by bus for more than an hour in order to reach the first event.\n\nCanadians go to the polls on 21 October.\n\nMore on the Canadian election", "description": "A coach full of journalists collides with the wing of the prime minster's plane, leaving a scrape.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FDCF/production/_108757946_bus-crop.jpg"}
