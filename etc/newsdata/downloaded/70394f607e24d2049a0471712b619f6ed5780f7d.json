Meanwhile, under Trump, the Open Society founder has been pouring greater sums into lobbying than ever before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of the enemies I have,\u201d he told the New York Times in an interview published Friday, in which he confidently predicted the popular opposition to his globalist philosophy was winding down and that a backlash against Trump-style nationalism was on the horizon.\n\nIt\u2019s a perfect way to tell a dictator or a would-be dictator, if he identifies me as an enemy.\n\nSoros slammed the US president as \u201can aberration,\u201d predicting \u201cwhat he has done in the Middle East\u201d \u2013 clearing troops from the Turkish-Syrian border, allowing peace to break out with a deal between Russia and Turkey \u2013 \u201cwill contribute to his demise next year.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Soros gifts $5.1 million check to Democrats as he enters 2020 funding game\n\nTrump has called out Soros in the past, accusing him of paying the protesters who swarmed the Capitol over Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court and hinting that he was bankrolling the migrant caravans that swarmed the US\u2019 southern border last year. Soros is a popular villain among conservatives, who suspect that, after funding color revolutions in Serbia, Georgia, Ukraine, and elsewhere, he is trying to start one in the US. The currency speculation that has made him enemies from Malaysia to Britain has also made him rich enough to contribute billions toward funding what are usually described as \u201cprogressive causes\u201d through his Open Society Foundations.\n\nAnd he is spending more than ever on those causes, dumping some $15.9 million to influence Congress in just the third quarter of 2019 via his foundation\u2019s lobbying division, the Open Society Policy Center, according to a recent filing. It\u2019s a jump even over the group\u2019s 2018 expenditures, which, at $31.5 million, made it the third-largest lobbying group that year. Only the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Realtors outspent the billionaire.\n\nAside from lobbying, Soros spreads his money around liberally in more ways than one. He has funded media organizations like Democracy Now! and Media Matters, pro-immigration groups like the National Immigration Law Center and the Migration Policy Institute, think tanks like the Aspen Institute and the Center for American Progress, fundraising organizations like MoveOn.org that stages anti-Trump protests, and interventionist policy groups like the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect. He has already donated millions to the Democratic Party for 2020.\n\n\u201cThere are more Main Streets in America than there are Wall Streets,\u201d he said, calling Elizabeth Warren \u2013 who wants to tax the wealthy heavily \u2013 the most qualified person to be president.\n\nAlso on rt.com Cold War with China more important than US interests, Soros warns Trump in op-ed\n\nSoros also has a \"mortal enemy\" - China, the nation that fought a winning battle against his currency speculating in 1998, so now he calls \u201cXi Jinping\u2019s China the worst threat to an open society.\u201d Given what has happened to the other societies Soros has poured money into, Xi might take that as a compliment.\n\nLike this story?
