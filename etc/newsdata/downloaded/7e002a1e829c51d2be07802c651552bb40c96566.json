The 2019 CEI evaluates LGBTQ-related policies and practices including non-discrimination workplace protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-inclusive health care benefits, competency programs, and public engagement with the LGBTQ community.\n\n\u201cThe top-scoring companies on this year\u2019s CEI are not only establishing policies that affirm and include employees here in the United States, they are applying these policies to their global operations and impacting millions of people beyond our shores,\u201d said HRC President Chad Griffin. \u201cMany of these companies have also become vocal advocates for equality in the public square, including the dozens that have signed on to amicus briefs in vital Supreme Court cases and the more than 170 that have joined HRC\u2019s Business Coalition for the Equality Act. Time and again, leading American businesses have shown that protecting their employees and customers from discrimination isn\u2019t just the right thing to do -- it\u2019s also good for business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very proud that Gannett has once again scored 100% on The HRC CEI. We continue to lead the way for being one of best places to work for all employees, including our LGBTQ+ employees,\u201d said Dave Harmon, chief people officer, Gannett | USA TODAY NETWORK.\n\nFor more information on the 2019 Corporate Equality Index, visit www.hrc.org/cei.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign Foundation is the educational arm of America's largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual transgender and queer people. HRC envisions a world where LGBTQ people are embraced as full members of society at home, at work and in every community.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/04/01/gannett-usa-today-network-named-one-best-places-work-lgbtq-equality/3332978002/", "description": "Gannett | USA TODAY NETWORK achieved 100 percent on Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s 17th annual scorecard.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published P.M.
