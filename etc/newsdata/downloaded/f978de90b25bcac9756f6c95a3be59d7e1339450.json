From the first phone call, I wanted to be involved as much as possible. I asked what tests she was having, and what checks the local nurses were doing to make sure the baby was okay. When she told me that she had been advised not to lift heavy things, I listened very carefully. My goal in life is to take care of my family \u2014 not to stick to old-fashioned traditions about who does what around the house. Now that I\u2019m back in Nepal, I\u2019m trying to do as much of the domestic chores as possible, as well as the agricultural work. When our baby is born, I\u2019ll do as much as I can to help raise them too.", "description": "\u2018In the past, men here were totally outcast from anything to do with pregnancy\u2019", "authors": ["Francesco Brembati"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ve0u_MFFsWsZReXRp6RlxN9USjU=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OH3BXSHWYVFLVBWKV2QYYAPI44.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
