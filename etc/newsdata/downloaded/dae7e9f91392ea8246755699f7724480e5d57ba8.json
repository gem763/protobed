If California ever were to leave the agreement, I think we can continue alone but I would prefer California remain in the agreement and even other states [join],\" he told reporters in Quebec City.\n\nLegault said the cap-and-trade system has proven effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and that he favours the policy over a carbon tax.", "description": "Quebec finds itself in the middle of a legal battle launched by the Trump administration against the state of California.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5036318.1571845874!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/carbon-tax-poll-20190212.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
