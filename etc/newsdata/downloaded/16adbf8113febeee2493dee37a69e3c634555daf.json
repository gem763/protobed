recognition of the right of future generations to live in a world with a stable environment, and make sure policy-making takes that into account.\n\nGreater value should also be given to environmental projects which have long-term benefits for future generations in the process of making public investment decisions, it says.\n\nThe report comes ahead of global climate strikes later this week when children and students across the UK are set to walk out of lessons and lectures to call for urgent action from politicians to tackle the climate and wildlife crises.\n\nIn the UK, one of the demands of the climate strikers is to lower the voting age to 16, in recognition they have the greatest stake in the future.\n\nLuke Murphy, Head of IPPR\u2019s Environmental Justice Commission, said: \u201cCurrent and future generations face a toxic inheritance as a consequence of environmental breakdown. Political leaders and policymakers must recognise the duty they owe to the next and future generations. Crucially, they must act to protect them by giving legal recognition to their rights and by giving them a voice in our political system.\u201d\n\nIn order to limit environmental breakdown younger generations will have to use far smaller quantities of resources over their lifetimes than older generations, the report states. They will have to build sustainable economic models and cope with issues such as food prices pushed up by extreme weather hitting production and the emotional toll of dealing with rapid change and damage to society.\n\nShadow minister for voter engagement and youth affairs, Cat Smith, said: \u201cOur young people are a force to be reckoned with, who are taking to the street, leading the climate strikes and using their voices to influence positive change. Yet instead of being supported and valued, young people continue to have their voices ignored by this government.\n\n\u201cAt the next election, Labour will set out a bold policy agenda that will radically change young people\u2019s lives, including tackling the climate crisis, scrapping tuition fees, and extending the vote to 16-year-olds.\u201d\n\nBut a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe age of 18, not 16, is widely recognised as the age at which one becomes an adult. Full citizenship rights \u2013 from drinking, to smoking, to voting \u2013 should only be gained at adulthood. What is vital is that we educate people from a younger age about democracy and give them the confidence and enthusiasm to participate when they are 18.\n\n\u201cThe Government has developed a variety of programmes to deliver this and works in partnership with schools and civil society groups across the country.\u201d", "description": "The voting age should be lowered to 16 because today\u2019s young people\u00a0are the ones that face a \u201ctoxic inheritance\u201d of environmental crises, a leading think tank has said.\u00a0 Climate change, the loss of wildlife and damage to the oceans and soils will be problems that the next generation will have to deal with, a report from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has", "authors": ["Emily Beament", "Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/30/19/Extinction-Rebellion-manchester.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
