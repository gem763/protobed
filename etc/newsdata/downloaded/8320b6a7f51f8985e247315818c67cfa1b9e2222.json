(Photo by Dannie Walls/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nNo. 1 Clemson finally got a scare, and it survived. Barely.\n\nThe top-ranked Tigers, boasting a 19-game winning streak, marched into Chapel Hill to take on North Carolina and faced a much tougher challenge than most expected. North Carolina had a chance to take the lead with a two-point conversion with 1:14 to play, but the Tar Heels were stuffed and the Tigers escaped with a 21-20 victory.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe game was tied at 14-14 entering the fourth quarter, and the Tar Heels were driving into Clemson territory. But Clemson\u2019s defense would step up, getting a stop on fourth-and-short near midfield.\n\nThe Tigers\u2019 offense then capitalized on the good field position when Trevor Lawrence found Tee Higgins for a go-ahead 38-yard touchdown catch. That score proved to be the game-winner, even after UNC freshman quarterback Sam Howell took his team the length of the field in the final minutes. Javonte Williams\u2019 one-yard plunge cut the Clemson lead to 21-20, and Mack Brown opted to go for two and the lead.\n\nThe Tar Heels dialed up an option play, and Howell was smothered by an array of Clemson defenders. The pitch somehow made its way to a UNC back, but Clemson was there to get the stop.\n\n(via ESPN)\n\nFrom there, UNC tried an onside kick, but Clemson recovered it and took a knee to finally breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nClemson\u2019s offense has issues to sort out\n\nAs hard as North Carolina played, it felt like Clemson was kind of going through the motions for most of the first half \u2014 especially on offense. UNC marched right down the field and scored on its first drive, so Clemson was playing from behind all afternoon. But the Tigers still seemed to have a lack of urgency even after tying the score at 7-7 early in the second quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe game was tied 14-14 at halftime, and Lawrence had constant pressure in his face throughout the third quarter. By the time that frame ended, Clemson had just 42 yards of offense with a turnover on downs and three punts. It was ugly. Lawrence wasn\u2019t without fault either. Yes, he was under pressure, but he missed some throws he usually converts in yet another example of Lawrence not being quite as sharp as he was during Clemson\u2019s CFP run a year ago.\n\nBut Lawrence made the big throw when it mattered. His game-winning connection with Higgins came on third-and-6, and it was arguably his best pass of the afternoon.\n\nThe Tigers are fortunate to leave Chapel Hill with the victory, and now Dabo Swinney will have plenty of material to get his team\u2019s attention moving forward. And if recent years are any indication \u2014 Clemson barely beat Syracuse in Week 5 last year \u2014 the Tigers will be just fine.\n\nClemson is now 5-0 entering a bye week with games against Florida State and Louisville on the horizon.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "No. 1 Clemson finally got a scare, and it survived.
