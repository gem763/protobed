Snodgrass", "language": "en", "text": "As a reporter covering the Pentagon during this turbulent time, I was disappointed \u2014 though not surprised \u2014 to discover that the memoir Mattis actually wrote focused on his 40-plus years in the Marine Corps. In his book, he had no problem excoriating past presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, but Trump\u2019s name appeared only four times in the text \u2014 all in the prologue. \u201cI don\u2019t write about sitting presidents,\u201d Mattis said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn \u201cHolding the Line: Inside Trump\u2019s Pentagon With Secretary Mattis,\u201d Snodgrass cracks the former general\u2019s carefully crafted facade. Full of juicy anecdotes from meetings with the president and key Cabinet members that Snodgrass witnessed, the book reflects Mattis\u2019s growing frustration with an erratic boss who won\u2019t listen to him, and charts his gradual slide into irrelevance. It shows Trump making shockingly crass statements about issues of global importance behind closed doors. \u201cSeriously, who gives a sh-- about Afghanistan?\u201d is just one of dozens of examples that litter the book.\n\nThe portrait of Mattis that emerges is one my colleagues and I in the press corps know well: a defense secretary zealously guarding his public image at the expense of the institution he was tasked with leading. Mattis surrounded himself with current and former military officers who frequently overran the department\u2019s career civil servants, eroding the long-held American principle of civilian control of the military. And he disdained the press, directing the military services to limit communications with journalists and encouraging his assistant for public affairs, Dana White, to clamp down on information and access. \u201cNever forget, Bus,\u201d White says, using Snodgrass\u2019s call sign, a nickname given to military aviators. \u201cThe press is the enemy.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon press corps felt this chilling effect firsthand. Reporters found planned embeds mysteriously canceled or our names left off the invite lists for important briefings after unflattering coverage. We were frequently booted off trips with Mattis and other senior officials at the last minute. The honest public affairs officers were no longer able to provide us with accurate information; the dishonest ones openly lied. White stopped giving televised briefings \u2014 a weekly occurrence in previous administrations \u2014 in May 2018, nearly seven months before Mattis resigned.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMembers of Mattis\u2019s staff, including Snodgrass, also became casualties of his souring relationship with the president. Snodgrass had uprooted his young family and sidetracked his career as a naval aviator to work for Mattis, but he was sidelined after his decision to retire from the Navy. Mattis, who never married, had an \u201cuncompromising view on military service,\u201d Snodgrass writes; to him, service came before everything else. Snodgrass ultimately resigned after Kevin Sweeney, Mattis\u2019s chief of staff, blocked a job offer he received from another Pentagon office.\n\nSnodgrass\u2019s on-the-record, first-person account vindicates reporting about Mattis\u2019s waning influence. Starting in the summer of 2018, the defense secretary was indeed iced out: His personal interactions with the president dropped off, and he was blindsided by major announcements like the cancellation of military exercises with South Korea and the creation of a Space Force.\n\nIt\u2019s telling that the Pentagon delayed the publication of this book by asking for extensive last-minute redactions, prompting Snodgrass to sue the department this summer. His lawyers allege that defense officials were acting out of loyalty to Mattis, who has worked hard to avoid any public conflict with Trump. Longtime officials pushed back on that narrative, telling me it is normal for the Pentagon to protect certain privileged, though not classified, conversations. The Pentagon ultimately backed down, approving the manuscript with just minor redactions in September.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe result is a nuanced, not always flattering account of Mattis\u2019s time as defense secretary, from the point of view of someone who was in his inner circle. In one of the most prophetic episodes \u2014 a briefing at the Pentagon in July 2017 after a catastrophic trip to NATO when the president refused to reaffirm the mutual defense agreement in Article 5 of the group\u2019s founding treaty \u2014 Mattis hopes to explain to Trump the value of alliances. But Trump repeatedly interrupts the presentation, exclaiming, \u201cOur trade agreements are criminal!,\u201d offering non sequiturs that reflect his latest obsessions (\u201cThe USS Ford [the Navy\u2019s newest aircraft carrier] is completely out of control with cost overruns!\u201d) and expressing his desire for a \u201cVictory Day\u201d military parade.\n\nMost ominously, the president proposes a violent way of dealing with Iran\u2019s harassing of U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf: \u201cIf surrounded by Iran again, the captain oughta blow them out of the water!\u201d he says. The irony was not lost on me about a year later when Trump called off a retaliatory missile strike after Iran shot down an expensive U.S. drone.\n\nThe anecdote could be a metaphor for Mattis\u2019s tenure as defense secretary. Over the course of the meeting, Snodgrass sees how his boss begins to shut down, \u201csitting back in his chair with a distant, defeated look on his face.\u201d Mattis took the job convinced that he could make a difference, armed with like-minded allies such as then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster, all intent on educating the president. But Mattis\u2019s early attempts to mold Trump\u2019s worldview fell on deaf ears, and his influence faded. The defense secretary became increasingly cut off from the White House, particularly after the departures of Tillerson and McMaster and the arrival of a new set of advisers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn another revealing anecdote that serves as a bookend, Mattis hosts the new leadership team at the Pentagon on May 11, 2018. Snodgrass describes watching as Mattis gradually loses control of the room. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and then-national security adviser John Bolton continually interrupt the defense secretary mid-sentence. \u201cI fully expected Mattis to say something about it or to reassert himself, but he never did,\u201d Snodgrass writes. As the meeting begins to peter out, Mattis thanks everyone for coming, gathers his things and walks out of the room. But when it becomes clear that Pompeo, Bolton and the other attendants have remained behind to continue their conversations, Mattis returns to hover awkwardly in the doorway.\n\n\u201cAfter another minute, Mattis slowly turned and walked back out again.
