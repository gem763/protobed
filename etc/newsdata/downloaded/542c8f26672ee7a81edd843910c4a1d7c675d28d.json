Those bombs would pose a threat to Israel, other U.S. allies in the Middle East, and eventually Europe and the U.S. itself.\n\nIran\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, stated that Tehran would further breach the nuclear deal if Europe fails to provide Iran with a $15 billion line of credit aimed at offsetting the impact of crippling U.S. economic sanctions.\n\nThe United States and Europe would be making a mistake of historic proportions if they surrender to this latest Iranian threat. Instead, they should stand firm and make clear that Iran will receive sanctions relief only if and when it negotiates a comprehensive new nuclear deal that meets the 12 conditions stipulated by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a May 2018 address.\n\nWashington should make clear that these sanctions will remain in place until Iran concludes a new agreement ensuring, in a verifiable manner, that it has abandoned its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n\nPremature concessions would merely incentivize Iran to engage in further nuclear blackmail, thereby undermining the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s ability to verify the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The agency is the United Nations body tasked with monitoring and verifying Iran\u2019s key nuclear-related commitments.\n\nIran\u2019s latest efforts to intimidate the world come in the wake of multiple Iranian violations of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nAccording to a report issued last month by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran has exceeded the nuclear deal\u2019s limits on uranium stockpiles, uranium enrichment, and installations of advanced centrifuges known as the IR-6.\n\n\u201cEvaluations regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities for Iran remained ongoing,\u201d the report added, effectively acknowledging that the International Atomic Energy Agency has yet to confirm the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nAt the same time, Iran has reportedly refused to answer the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s questions about radioactive material at a covert nuclear warehouse in Tehran exposed by Israel last year.\n\nIran\u2019s failure to declare this material may constitute a violation of a separate set of accords in addition to the nuclear deal, known as the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and that agreement\u2019s additional protocol.\n\nThese agreements, which Iran signed in 1973 and 2003 respectively, obligate Iran to provide the International Atomic Energy Agency with information about all nuclear facilities, materials and activities in its territory.\n\nIn its August report, the International Atomic Energy Agency alluded to these possible breaches, stating that its interactions with Tehran regarding the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and the additional protocol \u201crequire full and active cooperation by Iran.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Iran may have violated the three agreements it concluded by failing to declare nuclear sites, equipment and materials identified in the nation\u2019s covert atomic archive, which Israel seized from a Tehran warehouse last year.\n\nThe archive discloses a range of sites, equipment and activity previously unknown to the International Atomic Energy Agency, thereby raising the possibility that illicit conduct continues today without the agency\u2019s knowledge.\n\nIran\u2019s threat to infringe the nuclear deal\u2019s restrictions on centrifuge research and development marks a further escalation.\n\nIn theory, depending on the rate of Tehran\u2019s research and development activity, Iran\u2019s breakout time \u2013 that is, the amount of time needed to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for one nuclear weapon \u2013 could drop in half by this time next year.\n\nAccording to an estimate by the Institute for Science and International Security, Iran\u2019s breakout time as of August was 7.3 to 11.74 months, down from a range of 7.7 to 12.4 months just two months earlier, before its latest nuclear deal violations.\n\nIn the face of Iran\u2019s defiance, France is negotiating with Tehran \u2013 in coordination with other parties to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \u2013 on a $15 billion letter of credit that would enable Iran to receive hard currency, thereby compensating it for the loss of oil sales resulting from U.S. sanctions.\n\nAt the root of this proposal lies the apparent assumption that Washington\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear deal \u2013 and the consequent economic crisis Iran faces \u2013 has spurred an Iranian decision to achieve a nuclear breakout in retaliation. Thus, by mitigating Iran\u2019s economic woes, the world could supposedly incentivize Iran to return to compliance with the nuclear deal.\n\nThe truth is more complicated. In reality, Iran\u2019s incremental nuclear violations aim not to start a war, but to project resolve and to weaken U.S. deterrence.\n\nIran recognizes that so long as the U.S. is not a party to the nuclear deal, Tehran\u2019s only path out of its economic predicament is to negotiate with the United States. But by extracting funds from the international community, Iran can help stabilize its economy as it waits out the clock until America\u2019s 2020 election, hoping that President Trump loses to a candidate who seeks to reenter the nuclear deal.\n\nTrump withdrew the U.S. from the nuclear agreement with Iran over a year ago, fulfilling a campaign promise.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cAt the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction, that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful, nuclear energy program,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cToday, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie.\u201d\n\nShould the world capitulate now to Tehran\u2019s threats, it would make productive negotiations less likely. After all, Iran would have no incentive to compromise on its nuclear program if it faces no meaningful economic penalties for its misbehavior.\n\nUltimately, Iran will only negotiate a stronger nuclear deal if the costs of its nuclear misconduct far exceed the benefits.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe United States and Europe should, therefore, double down on economic sanctions against Iran. In the absence of such measures, Iran will likely continue its efforts to blackmail the international community, pocketing concessions without altering the malign behavior that spurred the crisis in the first place.\n\nWashington should make clear that these sanctions will remain in place until Iran concludes a new agreement ensuring, in a verifiable manner, that it has abandoned its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n\nTzvi Kahn is a senior Iran analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
