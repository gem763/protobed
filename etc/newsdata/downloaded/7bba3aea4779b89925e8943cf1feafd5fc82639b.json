For Unilever, 97 per cent of its palm oil used in Europe was green, compared with 41 per cent in India and 48 per cent in China.\n\nNestle said it was committed to achieving RSPO sustainable certification for 100 per cent of its palm oil by 2023.\n\n\"Achieving a sustainable palm oil industry... requires all companies in the supply chain to take action,\" a Nestle spokesman told Reuters by email.\n\nGemma Shaw, a Unilever spokeman, said her company was also committed to sustainable palm oil.\n\n\"Although consumer demand... does vary from market to market, our commitment is a global one,\" Ms Shaw said, adding that the RSPO numbers were old and that Unilever has made progress since then.\n\nPepsi and Procter & Gamble did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Energy & Commodities - [KUALA LUMPUR] A palm oil industry watchdog will adopt rules next month that will impose fines on consumer goods companies like Unilever and Nestle if they don't start buying more green palm oil to help curb deforestation in South-east Asia, the regulating body said. .
