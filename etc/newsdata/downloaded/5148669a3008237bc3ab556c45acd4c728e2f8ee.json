He has been here for five years now and we\u2019re still making similar mistakes as we were the first year,\u201d Kane, who scored Spurs\u2019 opener from the penalty spot, told reporters.\n\nLucas Moura doubled Tottenham\u2019s lead but Olympiakos hit back before halftime through Daniel Podence and equalised thanks to Mathieu Valbuena\u2019s penalty in the 54th minute.\n\n\u201cWe are not young anymore, we are not inexperienced, we have played in big games for club and country,\u201d England international Kane added.\n\n\u201cWe have to try to find a way to get around it and improve and get better. That\u2019s all we can try to do.\u201d\n\nPochettino, who joined Tottenham in 2014 and had been linked by Spanish media with a switch to Real Madrid last season, said he was concerned by Spurs\u2019 wobbly start to the campaign.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning of this season we\u2019re conceding a lot of chances, lots of goals and we need to change that,\u201d Pochettino, who dismissed rumours last month that he could quit, added.\n\n\u201cThe only way we can change is being more demanding from ourselves. That is the way we are going to approach the different days and be more consistent.\n\n\u201cTraining needs to be harder. Psychologically harder.\u201d", "description": "Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane said he fully understands manager Mauricio Pochettino's frustration with the team, asserting that they had failed to learn from past mistakes following Wednesday's 2-2 Champions League draw at Olympiakos Piraeus.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431514037&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0F8", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
