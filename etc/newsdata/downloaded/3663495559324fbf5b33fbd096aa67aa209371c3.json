It was then that Ken Henry and his team of technical and financial advisers convinced our cabinet that a public build of full fibre-to-the-premises represented the best option for taxpayers.\n\nNode disaster\n\nI vividly remember the day when Ken stunned us all with his panel\u2019s recommendation. For a pro-market guy like me, the decision to establish a new state-owned enterprise to commence the single largest infrastructure project in Australian history was not taken lightly. However counter-intuitive, the sheer weight of evidence confirmed this was the right choice.\n\n\u201cTelstra\u2019s mantra was complete domination and thuggery, played out in a high-stakes game of aggressive bluff.\u201d \u2014 Liberal frontbencher Don Randall in 2009\n\nThat plan has now gone haywire under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. It is now delivering much worse speeds, four years overdue, at a higher cost than if they\u2019d just built it right the first time. Indeed, it killed the viability of the NBN by changing the model from fibre-optic to the premises to fibre-optic to the mythical \u201cnode\u201d, leaving the last bit in copper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only person this made happy was Rupert Murdoch because it helped to protect his Foxtel cable network from web-based competitors such as Netflix, which have limited potential over copper. Even with this protection, Foxtel\u2019s base of subscribers has more than halved over the past decade, dropping from almost 7 million in 2009 to less than 3 million today. Anyone who read Murdoch\u2019s newspapers at that time would have struggled to spot the real news between the partisan hit-jobs on Labor and preaching about how \u201cAustralia needs Tony\u201d.\n\nGiven Telstra\u2019s history of obstinacy, I was stunned to read Minchin\u2019s claim in The Australian Financial Review that Trujillo acted \u201chonourably and appropriately\u201d with his non-compliant NBN bid, which his own parliamentary colleague Randall lashed as \u201cinsulting\u201d.\n\nRupert Murdoch was the biggest winner from sticking to copper to the premises. James Alcock\n\nHowever, more shocking is Minchin\u2019s opinion that, in retrospect, the Howard government should have accepted Telstra\u2019s unsolicited offer in 2005 to roll out fibre-to-the-node broadband to 4 million addresses across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide for $4.7 billion.\n\nRather than ending the digital divide between city and country, the Trujillo-Minchin plan would have entrenched it. It would have choked off economic opportunity, stymied new services such as tele-health for regional communities, and further drive young people to the big smoke.\n\nThere remains a lot of myth making around the NBN, but hopefully Mullen\u2019s candour will help put some of this to bed.", "description": "Telstra's bullying prompted the government to step in to build a broadband network.
