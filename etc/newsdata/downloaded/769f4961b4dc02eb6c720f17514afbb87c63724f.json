Look at everything that has happened, he doesn\u2019t want to leave,\u201d said Franco Garcia, 21, adding he voted for Mesa, a former president, because he would be easier to topple if needed.\n\n\u201cIf we continue with Evo, then something like Venezuela awaits us. He has too much power.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage Bolivia's Morales calls on military to unite amid turmoil over disputed election\n\nThe unrest - already the severest test of Morales\u2019 rule since he came to power in 2006 - could spread if the outright victory is confirmed, after monitors, foreign governments and the opposition called on Morales to hold a second round vote.\n\nThe tensions began after an official quick vote count was disrupted by a day-long halt starting late on Sunday, when a preliminary count of almost 84% of ballots showed the two main rivals heading to a second round.\n\n\u2018COUP D\u2019ETAT\u2019\n\nMorales, the country\u2019s first indigenous leader, struck a defiant tone on Wednesday.\n\nIn a fiery speech at the government office in La Paz, Morales criticized recent violence that saw electoral offices torched and skirmishes between protesters and police, blaming it on the right-wing opposition and what he described as their foreign backers.\n\n\u201cI have called this conference to denounce, in front of the Bolivian people and the entire world, that a coup d\u2019etat is in progress. In advance, the right had prepared with international support for a coup,\u201d he said.\n\nMorales called on the people to \u201cdefend democracy.\u201d Later in the day, he sought to shore up backing from the country\u2019s military at an event in the region of Cochabamba, a key source of political support.\n\nAt an evening news conference, government minister Carlos Romero denounced \u201cviolent groups,\u201d which he said were seeking to confront police with explosives, adding the government would look to hold responsible those promoting the violence.\n\nBolivia's President Evo Morales speaks during a news conference at the presidential palace La Casa Grande del Pueblo in La Paz, Bolivia, October 23, 2019.

What\u2019s he afraid of?\u201d asked Maria Luz Vargas, 65, a newspaper seller in La Paz who had joined the protests.\n\nThe official election monitor, the Organization of American States, had called the count into question and cited a \u201cdrastic\u201d and inexplicable shift in the vote, which it said hurt voters\u2019 confidence in the electoral process.\n\nAntonio Costas, one of the six-member electoral team coordinating the vote, stepped down on Tuesday in protest at the halt to the rapid count, although he told Reuters he had not come under political pressure.\n\nA number of foreign governments, including the United States, Brazil and the European Union, also voiced concerns about the integrity of the vote.\n\nAt a meeting on Wednesday, the OAS recommended a second-round vote go ahead even if Morales reached a 10-point lead.\n\nSlideshow (17 Images)\n\nMorales has maintained throughout that when the final vote count was announced, he would obtain a first-round win, helped by strong support in the countryside.\n\n\u201cOur triumph has always been with the votes from the rural areas with the votes of the indigenous movement,\u201d he said on Wednesday, adding he would respect the final result.", "description": "Bolivia's leftist leader Evo Morales was on track to win a fraught presidential race outright, edging to a decisive 10-point lead over his main rival after accusing the opposition on Wednesday of attempting a \"coup\" against him.", "authors": ["Mitra Taj", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444163737&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1IC", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
