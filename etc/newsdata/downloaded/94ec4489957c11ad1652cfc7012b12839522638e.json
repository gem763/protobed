SEA LIFE\n\n\"Marama and Rocky have taken to becoming parents like ducks to water, or should I say penguins,\" Sea Life London general manager Graham McGrath previously said in a statement sent to Insider's Anneta Konstantinides.\n\n\"Caring for a newborn is tough for anyone, from the sleepless nights to the constant feeding, yet this wonderful pair of penguin parents are completely unflappable and seem to be taking it all in stride.\"\n\nCommenting on the decision to raise the chick genderless, McGrath said in a statement: \"While the decision may ruffle a few feathers, gender neutrality in humans has only recently become a widespread topic of conversation, however, it is completely natural for penguins to develop genderless identities as they grow into mature adults.\n\n\"What makes us really proud at the aquarium is the success of Sea Life London's Gentoo breeding programme and the amazing job of same-sex penguins Rocky and Marama who took the chick under their wing and raised it as their own.\"\n\nThe chick receives its health checks. SEA LIFE\n\nGentoo penguins currently have near-threatened status in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as a result of climate change affecting feeding and nesting habits in their natural habitats, so Sea Life's conservation programme plays an important role in marine conservation.\n\nThe aquarium says the adopted chick may become part of its breeding programme depending on the gender its biology determines.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe London Zoo is hosting a Pride celebration for its same-sex penguin couples\n\nA same-sex penguin couple at the Berlin Zoo has adopted an abandoned egg\n\n23 fascinating things you never knew about penguins", "description": "The adopted Gentoo chick will become Sea Life London Aquarium's first penguin not to have its gender assigned.", "authors": ["Rachel Hosie"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d78c593f4fc247c1a02280e-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
