Now, according to two people familiar with events, Gowdy is never expected to join the team. And Trump advisers are back to square one, searching for a different lawyer.\n\nHow a celebrated announcement quickly ended in disarray offers a rare public glimpse into the internal posturing \u2014 and undercutting of colleagues \u2014 that has been playing out in the West Wing on a daily basis since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry last month. Even as the White House confronts a deepening threat to Trump\u2019s presidency, it has struggled to decide how to respond, and who should lead that response.\n\nThis article is based on interviews with a half-dozen aides and other people close to Trump.\n\nThe official story, circulated by senior administration aides to a handful of reporters, was that Gowdy, who retired from Congress last year, had agreed to reenter the fray Tuesday. Gowdy\u2019s name began circulating on Twitter as the new Trump defender, prompting a number of aides to the president to claim credit privately for the idea of bringing him on board.\n\nBut by Wednesday evening, aides were distancing themselves from the bungled personnel maneuver, which was made public before all the usual procedural boxes had been checked. Several pointed fingers at Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, suggesting he had botched the rollout.\n\nFor weeks, aides had been pushing Trump to add another lawyer to the outside team, and Mulvaney had suggested Gowdy, a former prosecutor. Trump needed another voice on television defending him, and Mulvaney wanted someone who understood how Congress works.\n\nThen Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) at the Library of Congress in Washington, Dec. 19, 2018. (Erin Schaff/The New York Times) More\n\nSome White House officials checked whether Emmet T. Flood, the lawyer who oversaw the administration\u2019s response to the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, would get involved. He was not available.\n\nAs Mulvaney pushed for Gowdy, a former House colleague and fellow South Carolinian, he swatted away questions from several aides about whether Gowdy would be curtailed in his role by lobbying regulations. Both men assured people that there would be no problem, according to the people briefed on what took place.\n\nNot everyone was on board with the idea. Among those generally concerned about someone working specifically on impeachment outside the White House Counsel\u2019s Office was the White House counsel himself, Pat Cipollone, according to three people involved in the discussions. Mulvaney and Cipollone have repeatedly been at odds since the impeachment inquiry began, with one disagreement about hiring an additional lawyer taking place in front of Trump, according to a person familiar with the discussion.\n\nTrump told the two aides to work it out on their own. A person close to Cipollone denied that there was concern about bringing aboard another outside lawyer.\n\nBefore Gowdy could be added, however, Trump needed to meet with him. So the two sat down for lunch at the White House on Tuesday; Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, joined them for part of the meal.", "description": "For 24 hours last week, Trey Gowdy, the former South Carolina congressman best known for leading congressional investigations of Hillary Clinton, was the new face of President Donald Trump's outside legal defense and a symbol of a streamlined effort to respond to a fast-moving impeachment inquiry.A", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman", "Annie Karni"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EBo1iLpAG7Bg6YUiRthlYQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/48aca575a77aa85487fb409ce226033d", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
