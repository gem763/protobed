But it said that it will give its users additional data, just to ensure there's no \u201ceffective increase\u201d in tariffs for its customers.\n\nCalls from Jio to Jio, to landlines and those made over apps such as WhatsApp will remain free.\n\nBut this was not enough for people on social media, who took to Twitter to share their angst and hence, #BoycottJio was trending on Twitter. Look at some of the reactions here:\n\n1.\n\n#ThankYouJio\n\nI am not going to #BoycottJio. I will only shift when @airtelindia or @VodafoneIN can beat this beast speed.\n\nAnd also it's just 6p/min, that too only on Jio to other networks.
