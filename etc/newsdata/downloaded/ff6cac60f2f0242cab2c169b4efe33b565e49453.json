It involves a bag of marshmallows and trying not to choke to death. Place a marshmallow in your mouth and say \u201cchubby bunny.\u201d Add another and repeat. Add two, three, four more. \u201cWhumby bwhunmy.\u201d Continue until the player can no longer utter anything resembling the fat-rabbit phrase or until the marshmallows appear to be impeding the ability to breathe. You can also play with grapes, but that always seemed riskier to me. Anyway, we\u2019re getting away from the point here. Why am I thinking about Chubby Bunny, you ask? Well. See.\n\nThere\u2019s this photo of two professionally hot people \u2014 Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp \u2014 kissing on a boat. Kissing, honestly, is perhaps the wrong word for it. The two are smashing their mouths together with their jaws so agape I feel my own TMJ flaring up. Depp\u2019s tongue plumbing the depths of Chalamet\u2019s mouth cavern like James Cameron in that li\u2019l sub looking for Titanic. Chalamet\u2019s head tilting upward toward Depp\u2019s, his mouth open at such an aggressive angle he looks like a human Pac-Man. Except instead of eating pellets and fruits, Chalamet is eating Depp\u2019s face. The image has been circulating as a meme all weekend. So you see, to return to the marshmallows \u2026 I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time thinking about Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s mouth. Depp\u2019s too, for that matter. Seems likely you could shove a fair amount of Jet-Puffed up there.", "description": "A picture of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp kissing on a boat has become a meme.
