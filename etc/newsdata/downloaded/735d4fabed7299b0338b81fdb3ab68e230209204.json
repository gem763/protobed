For the tea itself, use leaves rather than bags, as the pieces are larger and give more flavour. While bags give the water a burst of colour and provide a quick brew, the flavour is duller. Using leaves doesn\u2019t mean you have to use a pot: you can get great infuser baskets that allow you to make just one cup.\n\nAs for the water, if you live in an area where it is hard, invest in a filter. Hard water has a higher mineral content and is the reason for the oily scum you see sometimes on the surface of tea. For black teas, the water should be boiling as it hits the leaves, so heat your crockery with a little hot water beforehand. With green teas, you want the water a little cooler \u2013 about 70C to 80C.\n\nThe amount of milk you add is a personal preference, but strong black teas such as breakfast tea should be drunk with milk, as they are blended to be taken that way. Milk should be added only once the tea is ready.\n\nSugar should be added to chai tea only, but it is important to remember that tea is about enjoyment \u2013 it is a question of what you like more than anything else.\n\nAngela Pryce, a tea sommelier, was talking to Anna Michaux", "description": "Opt for leaves instead of bags, filter hard water \u2013 and add milk at the end", "authors": ["Angela Pryce"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93d83f876741f2353666808024a96739bbdae84d/338_898_7344_4406/master/7344.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2cbafe6561b93be7ec510c1b2140b979", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
