Courtesy of Sotheby's\n\nThe Najd Collection includes works from 44 artists, although half are by three key painters of the period: Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me of France, and Ludwig Deutsch and Rudolph Ernst of Austria.\n\n\u201cTechnically speaking, and in terms of the quality, and amazing colorful and vivid palettes, these artists really stand out,\u201d Piening says.\n\nWhile 40 works will be offered\u2014at what Sotheby\u2019s says is the highest estimated value for an orientalist sale\u2014all 155 in the collection will be shown together for the first time from Oct. 11-15 at the auction house\u2019s London gallery.\n\nCurrently, highlights are on tour, with 10 from the sale on view at Sotheby\u2019s galleries in New York. This same grouping will move to Los Angeles in mid-September, while a second group of 10 will be exhibited in Dubai and Paris. The 40 works will be sold in a dedicated auction the evening of Oct. 22, marking the first time Sotheby\u2019s has placed the category in an evening sale.\n\nThe Middle Eastern individual behind the collection was among the first from the region to collect orientalist art, coming across the works initially at Mathaf Gallery in London, where MacDermont specialized in the genre.\n\n\u201cHe is a very open-minded individual who was ahead of his curve in his part of the world in collecting this material,\u201d Piening says. \u201cBefore, orientalist art was really the preserve of Western collectors\u2014almost all the pictures are by Western artists and were made originally for Western consumption.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s largely because artists from the region in the 19th century \u201cwere more involved with craft, and geometric art, rather than painting in the Western sense of the word,\u201d he says. Photography was a new medium at the time, so other than the works of the orientalists, \u201cthere is very little visual record of how the Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey, looked at this time in history,\u201d Piening adds.\n\nOrientalist art has been criticized for unrealistic or exoticized depictions of Islamic life. A British Museum show of orientalist art that will run at the same time as the auction describes the genre as \u201coften blurring the lines between fantasy and reality.\u201d Inspired by the east: how the Islamic world influenced western art will be shown from Oct. 10 to Jan. 26.\n\nPiening says observations of exoticism often stem from paintings that were \u201cfigments of the imagination,\u201d typically of artists who had not even traveled to the region.\n\nThe artists represented in the Najd Collection, however, all traveled to Middle East, North Africa, or Turkey, and while some include the artistic license of a painter\u2014such as showing individuals praying at the same time in different positions versus in tandem\u2014it was often done as a deliberate device to educate people in the West, he says.\n\nAmong the highlights for sale is G\u00e9r\u00f4me\u2019s Riders Crossing the Desert, 1870, a painting of vivid red, blue, and shades of brown, depicting an Egyptian desert scene. It was painted a year after the Suez Canal opened, making the region more accessible. The work carries an estimate between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million.\n\nGerman artist Gustav Bauernfeind's Market in Jaffa, 1887, with an estimate between \u00a32.5 million and \u00a33.5 million, will be one of the artist\u2019s best works to appear on the international market, Sotheby\u2019s says.\n\n\u201cIt is a true tour de force that showcases Bauernfiend\u2019s great skill at rendering the local architecture and the hustle and bustle of a busy street,\u201d the auction house said in a Thursday news release.\n\nThe works for sale also include examples from the Turkish artist Osman Hamdy Bey, the only Middle Eastern painter to have worked in this same Western style, which he brought back to his country.\n\nHamdy Bey\u2019s Koranic Instruction, 1890, which carries an estimate between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million, depicts a sleepy, seated pupil.\n\n\u201cOn the face of it, [Koranic Instruction] looks similar [to European orientalist art], but because it\u2019s painted from the point of a view of an insider, there are references and puns, and little satirical elements, that only he as a Muslim could convey and express,\u201d Piening says.\n\nFor instance, in Islamic text on the painting, Hamdy Bey included the world \u2018sleeping,\u2019\u2014\u201cjust poking a little bit of fun, lightening the mood,\u201d he says.", "description": "Sotheby\u2019s to sell 40 of 155 works of the well-known grouping at October evening sale in London", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-104258/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
