Tulsi Gabbard said at the Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday night. \u201cAbortion should be safe, legal, and rare.\u201d\n\nClinton used this language in her 2008 presidential campaign; Bill Clinton, meanwhile, had introduced it into Democratic politics back in 1992. The language was likely meant to appeal to people who supported the right to an abortion in principle but still felt morally conflicted about the procedure \u2014 a large group, according to some polling. But many abortion rights advocates argued that calling for the procedure to be \u201crare\u201d placed stigma on people who seek it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental notion of bodily autonomy that we\u2019ve been fighting for as advocates and activists on this issue for years,\u201d Destiny Lopez, co-director of the All* Above All Action Fund, a nonprofit that works to expand abortion access, told Vox. Saying abortion should be rare \u201ccompletely negates all the work that we\u2019ve done to really make this about the ability to decide what\u2019s best for your body, for your family, for your community,\u201d she said.\n\nOver the years, Democrats have become more sympathetic to this view. By 2016, Hillary Clinton had changed her message, saying only that abortion should be \u201csafe and legal.\u201d It was part of a broader shift in the party toward more full-throated support of abortion rights. During the 2016 primaries, both Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders called for a repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions. Today, all the Democratic presidential candidates, including Gabbard, support allowing federal funding for the procedure \u2014 along with a slate of other reforms aimed at increasing access.\n\nBut as Gabbard showed, the framing of \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d isn\u2019t gone. Her comment, and the conversation surrounding it, were a reminder not just of how much the Democratic Party has changed in recent years on abortion rights, but of the divisions that still remain.\n\nDemocratic politicians have been moving away from \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d since 2012\n\nThe phrase \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d entered common usage during the 1992 campaign, when Bill Clinton frequently used it, according to the New York Times. \u201cWe have to remind the American people once again that being pro-choice is very different from being pro-abortion,\u201d he told the Congressional Women\u2019s Caucus that year.\n\nDuring her 2008 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton echoed her husband\u2019s message, emphasizing that \u201cby rare, I mean rare.\u201d\n\nBut over the years, abortion rights advocates have pushed back against the phrase. \u201cSafe, legal, and rare\u201d implies that getting an abortion is something that \u201cyou should be apologetic for,\u201d reproductive justice activist Renee Bracey Sherman told Vox. \u201cIt places the blame on the person who\u2019s had an abortion, as if they just did something wrong to need one, rather than addressing the systemic issue as to why someone might not be able to have access to consistent health care or contraception.\u201d\n\nThe push to destigmatize abortion has been part of a larger rise in people who have had abortions being open about their experiences.\n\n\u201cPrior to 2016, we did not have a lot of people publicly saying the word abortion\u201d or talking about their first-hand experiences, Lopez told Vox. But \u201cthere has just been this seismic shift\u201d in the last few years \u201cwhere we\u2019ve seen more public conversations about the realities of abortion access in this country.\u201d\n\nThose realities have changed a lot since 1992. Opponents of abortion have long sought to restrict the procedure, but after 2010, when Republicans took over many state legislatures, they successfully passed a slate of restrictions on abortion clinics that caused many facilities in the South and Midwest to close. Between 2011 and 2017, half of the clinics in Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, and Texas shut their doors. In 2017, 89 percent of counties had no abortion clinic, and six states had just one.\n\nThat made it much harder for many Americans to get an abortion, especially if they couldn\u2019t afford to travel to a far-away clinic.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s election in 2016 was soon followed by the appointment of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Many advocates on both sides of the issue believe that conservatives on the Court now have enough votes, if not to overturn the landmark abortion decision Roe v. Wade, then at least to significantly weaken it. Earlier this month, the Court announced it would take a case that could give states the green light to pass even more clinic restrictions, possibly legislating clinics out of existence.\n\nIn a time when access is dwindling and Roe is at risk, advocates have argued that calling for abortion to be \u201crare\u201d just makes it even harder for people who already struggle to get the procedure \u2014 who are disproportionately likely to be poor, people of color, LGBTQ, immigrants, or belong to more than one of these groups \u2014 to push for their right to get it.\n\n\u201cIf there are barriers put in front of a person,\u201d the \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d framing implies \u201cthat it does not matter because that procedure should be rare,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cSo it essentially is denying these folks the ability to really access the care that they deserve.\u201d\n\nFor that reason, the All* Above All Action Fund says that abortion should be \u201csafe, legal, accessible, and affordable,\u201d not rare, Lopez said.\n\nDemocratic candidates have been listening to concerns like these, and in recent years, they\u2019ve moved away from \u201csafe, legal, and rare.\u201d The word \u201crare\u201d was removed from the Democratic party platform in 2012, Bracey Sherman said, and in 2016, Clinton no longer used it on the campaign trail.\n\nA discussion of abortion in her 2017 book What Happened showed how much the former candidate\u2019s language had changed on the issue. \u201cWe can debate the morality of abortion forever,\u201d Clinton wrote, \u201cbut at the end of the day, who decides whether a woman gets or stays pregnant?\u201d\n\nHer answer: \u201cI say let women decide.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s shift was part of a bigger move in the Democratic Party toward more outspoken and less equivocal support of abortion rights. In particular, advocates had been calling for a repeal of Hyde for years because the amendment, first passed in 1976, blocks Medicaid coverage for almost all abortions. As a result, many low-income Americans are blocked from getting the procedure or forced to go into debt or forego necessities to pay for it.\n\nIn 2016, the Democratic Party added a call to repeal Hyde to its official platform. Today, all the Democrats running for the 2020 presidential nomination say they support allowing federal money to pay for abortions. Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who earlier this year supported leaving Hyde in place, now calls for its repeal.\n\nThe move to repeal Hyde and the move away from \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d are linked, Bracey Sherman said. \u201cThis is just a general shift in moving away from stigmatizing people who need and have abortions.\u201d\n\nDespite the shift, divisions on abortion remain among Democrats\n\nBut \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d isn\u2019t completely gone. Gabbard \u2014 who once identified as pro-life but now says she supports abortion rights \u2014 used the phrase at the fourth presidential debate on Tuesday night, when she was asked how she would stop states from restricting abortion access.\n\n\u201cWe see how the consequences of laws that you\u2019re referring to can often lead to a dangerous place,\u201d Gabbard went on. \u201cI do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.\u201d\n\nMany abortion rights advocates criticized her response, but one \u2014 former Planned Parenthood president Dr. Leana Wen \u2014 praised her, arguing that \u201cwe should reduce the need for abortions by investing in prevention.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t agree with @TulsiGabbard on a lot, but do appreciate that she brought up the third rail for Democrats: that abortion should be \u201csafe, legal, and rare.\u201d We should reduce the need for abortions by investing in prevention. \u2014 Leana Wen, M.D. (@DrLeanaWen) October 16, 2019\n\nWen broke with other abortion rights advocates some time ago. When she was removed as Planned Parenthood\u2019s president in July, she said in a statement that, \u201cI believe that the best way to protect abortion care is to be clear that it is not a political issue but a health care one.\u201d Some said the group ousted her because it was looking for \u201ca more aggressive political leader\u201d on abortion rights, while others said she had management issues.\n\nSince she left Planned Parenthood, Wen has argued that the best way to build public support for abortion rights is to seek common ground with people who may be uncomfortable with the procedure, but want it to remain legal. She wrote in a New York Times op-ed shortly after her departure that while leading the group, \u201cI reached out to people who wrestle with abortion\u2019s moral complexities, but who will speak out against government interference in personal medical decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to stop treating those whose views differ from our own with scorn and suspicion, and instead work together to safeguard our health, our rights and our future,\u201d she concluded.\n\nAnd after Tuesday\u2019s debate, Wen made clear that she saw the \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d framing as a way to reach out to people with different views on the issue. \u201cPro-choice & progressive movements will lose unless we allow more people to join who do not agree 100% with the most extreme ideology,\u201d she tweeted. (Wen declined, through a representative, to be interviewed for this story.)\n\nShe isn\u2019t the only abortion-rights supporter to use \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d in recent months. In an interview with NPR\u2019s Sarah McCammon earlier this year, Pamela Maraldo, a former president of Planned Parenthood who resigned in 1995 under circumstances similar to Wen\u2019s, said that she wanted Planned Parenthood to return to that framing.\n\n\u201cI think that people that are pro-choice are afraid of stigmatizing abortion when they say it should be rare,\u201d she said. But \u201cthat\u2019s not where I\u2019m coming from. I\u2019m coming from a place that too many trips to the doctor\u2019s, medical procedures, surgical procedures, could be and should be prevented.\u201d\n\nIn general, those who argue on behalf of prevention say that better access to contraception would naturally lead to abortion becoming rarer. Indeed, the abortion rate has hit an all-time low in recent years, and experts say better access to long-acting reversible contraceptives like IUDs is likely the reason why.\n\nBut moves by the Trump administration, like increased restrictions on Title X family planning funding and a weakening of the mandate that employer-based insurance cover birth control, could threaten access to contraception, especially among low-income Americans.\n\nEven if access were perfect, \u201ccontraception is not foolproof,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cPeople will always need abortion care in this country, period.\u201d\n\nThe disagreement between Wen and other activists, and among Gabbard and other candidates, is a reminder that even among people who generally support abortion rights, there are a lot of differences in approach and priorities.\n\nThat\u2019s why advocates like Bracey Sherman, who started the hashtag #AskAboutAbortion in 2016, have been pushing for moderators to ask questions about abortion rights in Democratic debates. Tuesday was the first time in four presidential debates (two of them spread across two nights) that moderators asked anything about abortion, Lopez noted.\n\n\u201cFor so long we heard, \u2018well, they\u2019re all pro-choice, it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u2019\u201d Bracey Sherman said. On Tuesday night, though, \u201cit was clear: they actually don\u2019t all have the same stance.\u201d", "description": "Democratic politicians used to say abortions should be \"safe, legal, and rare.\" Here\u2019s how that changed.", "authors": ["Anna North", "Alex Clark", "Jen Kirby", "Theodore Schleifer", "Terry Nguyen", "Ian Millhiser", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PQlwh9ZFZ7SSjW1mMP-38Z3JeCY=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19297180/GettyImages_1148266382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
