One of Manafort\u2019s deputies, Rick Gates, once told a group of lobbyists that in Kiev, \u201cPaul has a whole separate shadow government structure \u2026 In every ministry, he has a guy.\u201d During his years as a lobbyist in the country, Manafort was so successful at navigating its political inner-workings that prosecutors claim he made over $60 million.\n\nAccording to a report from the Washington Post, Rudy Giuliani did contact Manafort, while unsuccessfully pursuing evidence that would prove the real interference in the 2016 election was not of Trump-Russia, but Clinton-Ukraine. Giuliani claims that he has not spoken directly to Manafort in over two years, but admitted in an interview with the Post that, several times in recent months, he did consult him via a lawyer in an attempt to find a dossier that he believed could cast doubt onto the Russia investigation:\n\nGiuliani said his consultation with Manafort centered on trying to ascertain the veracity of a secret black ledger obtained by Ukraine\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which the New York Times revealed in an August 2016 story. The Times said the ledger recorded $12.7 million in cash payments from Yanukovych\u2019s political party to Manafort. The revelation led Manafort to resign from the campaign.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Was there really a black book? If there wasn\u2019t, I really need to know. Please tell him I\u2019ve got to know,\u2019\u201d Giuliani recalled asking Manafort\u2019s lawyer. \u201cHe came back and said there wasn\u2019t a black book.\u201d\n\nGiuliani hoped that the ledger would prove there was a false pretext for prosecutors to go after Manafort, and that this repudiation would then unspool the whole Russia investigation. However, prosecutors in his Virginia trial chose not to bring up the alleged dossier that got him fired, and he was still convicted of eight felonies, including laundering $30 million to obscure it from the IRS, and conspiring to tamper with witnesses.\n\nLike many elements of Giuliani\u2019s ventures in Ukraine, it appears he was searching for something that wasn\u2019t there. According to Serhiy Leschenko, a Ukrainian journalist and ex-parliament member who released the details that got Manafort fired, the idea that the \u201cblack book\u201d contained information to undermine the Russia investigation or prove an opposite collusion scandal was a hoax. \u201cGiuliani\u2019s entire approach is built on disinformation and the manipulation of facts,\u201d Leshchenko wrote in an op-ed in the Washington Post in September. \u201cGiuliani has developed a conspiracy theory in which he depicts my revelations about Manafort as an intervention in the 2016 U.S. election in favor of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t working. Giuliani\u2019s dealings in Ukraine have caught the attention of Republicans Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson \u2014 chairmen of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees \u2014 who have pressed the Attorney General to look into possible connections between the Clinton campaign and Ukraine. \u201cSuch allegations of corruption deserve due scrutiny, and the American people have a right to know when foreign forces attempt to undermine our democratic processes,\u201d the senators wrote in a letter to William Barr.", "description": "According to a report from the Washington Post, Rudy Giuliani contacted ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in prison via a lawyer, pursuing evidence that would show interference in the 2016 election involving Clinton connections in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/30/paul_manafort.w1200.h630.jpg"}
