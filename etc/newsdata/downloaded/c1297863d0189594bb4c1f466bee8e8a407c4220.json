In trying to accept this I had to have faith in our relationship and appreciate it for what it is.\"", "description": "Ayesha Parks, from South Africa, met Patrick Wells online and he divorced his wife after meeting the university student", "authors": ["Liana Jacob", "Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Mdwfeatures", "Ayesha Parks"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20531582.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Online-Age-Gap-Love.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
