It\u2019s really been eye-opening for me,\u201d he told The Wrap.\n\nJoker grossed an impressive $93.5 million domestically on its opening weekend and has so far taken in more than $245 million globally. Actor Joaquin Phoenix has earned rave reviews for his performance in the movie, which brings a dark, gritty approach to the super villain\u2019s origin story.\n\nCNN\u2019s Yang wrote that the movie\u2019s ending embodies Trump\u2019s survivalist instincts.\n\n\u201cPhillips may not have intended for his film to be a political parable \u2014 or maybe he did \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to imagine a darker ending for our real-world horror-comedy than that.\u201d\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
