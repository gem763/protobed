There are sections of the forum dedicated to clients discussing their experiences with sex workers.\n\nAccording to the Dutch Broadcast Foundation, which confirmed the breach with Hookers.nl, the hacker exploited a vulnerability in vBulletin, common online forum software. In the last two weeks, vBulletin has experienced two reported vulnerabilities, one of which was very severe. . vBulletin has since released a patch for that vulnerability, but not before several other websites were hacked.\n\nAre you a sex worker or client affected by the Hookers.nl breach, or a hack like this one? We'd love to hear from you. Contact Samantha Cole securely on Signal at +6469261726, direct message on Twitter, or by email.\n\nIn a post to Hookers.nl forums, a site admin confirmed the breach and recommended that users change their passwords. Several users are still posting to those forums, demanding that their accounts be deleted. But even if they delete their accounts, this won't recover the data that's already been exposed.\n\nThe Dutch Broadcast Foundation reported that after viewing the stolen data, some users could be identified by their email addresses. Both client and sex workers have accounts on the platform.\n\nAlthough prostitution is legal and regulated in the Netherlands, people still seek anonymity when they're buying services\u2014whether from websites like Hookers.nl or in person at brothels.\n\nKnow of any other websites hacked with the recent vBulletin exploit? We\u2019d love to hear from you.
