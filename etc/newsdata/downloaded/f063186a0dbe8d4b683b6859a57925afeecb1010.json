(NYSE: ) is set to release third-quarter 2019 results ahead of the bell on Oct 17. The paint giant\u2019s results will likely reflect the benefits of its cost management initiatives, pricing actions and strategic acquisitions. However, unfavorable impacts of soft industrial demand, currency and raw materials cost inflation are likely to have affected its performance.\n\n\n\nThe company has outperformed the industry year to date. While PPG Industries\u2019 shares gained around 14.7% over this period, the industry saw a decline of roughly 22.9%.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\n\n\nWhat do the Estimates Say?\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for PPG Industries for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $3,909 million, suggesting an expected year-over-year rise of 2.4%.\n\n\n\nFor the company\u2019s Industrial Coatings unit, net sales are expected to increase 1% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $1,544 million for the third quarter. The same for the Performance Coatings segment is pegged at $2,336 million, indicating a 2.1% increase on a year-over-year comparison basis.\n\n\n\nFactors at Play\n\n\n\nPPG Industries faces challenges from sluggish global industrial activities. It witnessed weaker industrial production across several key regions through the first half of 2019. Soft industrial demand for several of the company\u2019s businesses is likely to have impacted its third-quarter sales volumes.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the company faces headwind from unfavorable currency translation. Currency swings reduced its sales by more than 3% or around $130 million in the second quarter. Some unfavorable currency impact is expected to get reflected in third-quarter results.\n\n\n\nPPG Industries is also exposed to cost pressure associated with raw materials. It witnessed inflationary impacts through the first half. The company\u2019s third-quarter results are expected to continue to reflect the impact of input cost inflation, albeit to a lesser extent than what was witnessed during the first half.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the company is aggressively managing costs and is also implementing appropriate pricing actions. It remains focused on improving its cost structure and recovering margins through price increases amid an inflationary environment. The company is also taking steps to grow business inorganically through strategic acquisitions. Benefits of these initiatives might reflect on the company\u2019s bottom line in the September quarter.\n\n\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\n\n\nOur proven model does not show that PPG Industries is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.
