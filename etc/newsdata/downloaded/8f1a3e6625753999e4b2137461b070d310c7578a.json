That's an absolute corker...\u200b\n\nSeveral articles have since emerged in the press with almost identical headlines.\n\nBut while the reaction from comics has largely been of the eye-rolling variety, the fact that this study has made headlines at all is perhaps symptomatic of something greater.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Asking questions is what science is all about, but this paper asks to understand sex differences in humour while also articulating why the data it has drawn from is limited and biased. That itself is quite the joke.\n\nIt proudly asserts that it\u2019s the first of its kind to collate a bunch of other studies that look at our \u201chumour production abilities\u201d, which for a moment made me think of a sweatshop full of elves writing Christmas cracker jokes.\n\nIt even concedes that the test conditions were \u201csomewhat artificial, and do not represent everyday production of humour\u2026 [and] ignores the social context in which most humour is produced\u201d. It also never shies away from the fact that the existing studies have largely been limited to Western cultures and heterosexual people, and that it only looks at one type of humour (verbal).\n\nYet still we are left with those big headlines. If I type \u201cwomen are funnier than men\u201d into a search engine (I\u2019ve tried a few times on various peoples\u2019 devices today), articles with a headline asserting the opposite are everywhere.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly less funny, particularly when thinking about some of the young people I work with and how impressionable and insecure they can be when creating their first attempts at comedy.\n\nIt\u2019s concerning that headlines like this, and the accompanying effort at evolutionary justification, simply fuel an existing behavioural stereotype which implies straight men should be funny and straight women should be grateful appreciators. Everyone else\u2026 is forgotten.\n\nWhen an area of our culture and indeed of our experience as humans is ring-fenced for less than 50 per cent of us, at best it's annoying. At worst, it punishes great work and great minds into silence.\n\nIt\u2019s also off-putting to new audiences who might otherwise be up for trying a new show or comedy act. If you\u2019re forever being told one brand of ice cream is better than all the others, why would you then take the risk of parting with your cash to try those \u201cinferior\u201d brands?\n\nNone of us have to look far to see how these external pressures are expressed differently depending on the gender, sexuality, race and culture of a person. That is where we have to stand together and call BS.\n\nHumour is subjective, with one person\u2019s bad joke another person\u2019s comedy gold. Heck, some of us even find cats with toast on their heads funnier than most comedians. The most important thing is that humour belongs to all of us. And if any institution says otherwise, they are just plain wrong.\n\nGem Carmella is a comedy writer-performer, screen actor and educator.
