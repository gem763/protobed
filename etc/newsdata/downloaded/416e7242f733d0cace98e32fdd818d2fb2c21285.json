(Matt Cashore-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe first half of Saturday\u2019s Notre Dame-USC game ended in heated fashion, as the teams got into a large-scale shoving match before heading to the locker rooms.\n\nThe scrum began after USC ended the half with a one-yard run. Notre Dame\u2019s Jamir Jones and USC\u2019s Jay Tufele appeared to be at the center of the conflict.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIrish and Trojans getting acquainted at the half.

The shoving was apparently hard enough that USC head coach Clay Helton exited the clash after losing one of his shoes.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe officials assessed unsportsmanlike conduct penalties on both sidelines, essentially meaning that another such offense would result in an ejection for any player. It was actually the second time officials did such a thing on Saturday, as every player on both Texas and Oklahoma were given pregame unsportsmanlike conduct fouls before the Red River Showdown.\n\nUnfortunately, the ref at Notre Dame Stadium erred a bit in penalizing the two teams, announcing the fouls on \u201cNotre Dame and UCLA.\u201d\n\nThe 1-5 Bruins, on a bye this week, just cannot win this season.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Notre Dame and USC got into at halftime.
