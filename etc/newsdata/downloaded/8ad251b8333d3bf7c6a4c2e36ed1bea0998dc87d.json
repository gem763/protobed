A representative of Monumental Sports could not be immediately reached for comment. The Valor plays home games at Capital One Arena in the District.\n\nAD\n\nThe league cited \u201cfinancial constraints\u201d imposed upon it from previous operations of the AFL, as well as a multimillion-dollar lawsuit from an insurance company that provided workers\u2019 compensation coverage between 2009 and 2012. That lawsuit, filed earlier this month in New York State Supreme Court, claims that the league failed to, among other things, pay all of its premiums and carry out the terms of a previous financial settlement with the company.\n\n\u201cThe financial challenges we are now dealing with do not, however, reflect the determined efforts of our current shareholders to maintain the viability of the AFL,\u201d Boe said. \u201cOur shareholders have made significant investments to restructure and re-launch the AFL and make it successful.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAdditionally, they have continued to work actively with the League office to grow the sport in their respective markets. Every touchdown celebrated and every ArenaBowl trophy ever hoisted can be credited to their efforts and to our incredibly loyal and growing fanbase.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOfficial statement from the Arena Football League.https://t.co/XQxxZWyDFZ pic.twitter.com/RMymMIEMW5 \u2014 Arena Football League (@OfficialAFL) October 30, 2019\n\nThe other four teams in the AFL include the Albany Empire, which won ArenaBowl XXXII in August; the Philadelphia Soul; the Atlantic City Blackjacks and the Columbus Destroyers. The Atlantic City and Columbus teams were added this year to the league, which was founded in 1987, featured almost 20 teams at one point and has undergone several incarnations. This year\u2019s 12-game regular season schedule ran from April through July.\n\nBoe told the Albany Times Union that the AFL might pursue a touring business model similar to that of the Premier Lacrosse League, in which the teams travel together to different cities and stage mini-tournaments each weekend.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have been evaluating that as a potential model to go forward and keep the league alive,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cI hesitate to say that we have a sense that that is likely to be successful. It\u2019s the thing that we\u2019re looking at. We really don\u2019t see an alternative to that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBoe, whose ties to Leonsis date back to their time together at AOL, was an executive vice president and general counsel for Monumental before becoming the AFL\u2019s commissioner last year. Leonsis told The Post last year that if his company didn\u2019t \u201cstep in\u201d with a major investment, including the 2017 debuts of the Valor and the Brigade, the league \u201cprobably would have died.\u201d\n\nThe Valor defeated the Brigade in 2018 for the ArenaBowl title, staged at Royal Farms Arena in Baltimore.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe AFL is not folding,\u201d Ron Jaworski, a former NFL quarterback who is a majority owner of the Soul, told the Press of Atlantic City via text message Tuesday night. \u201cWe are ceasing local operations and all teams will be operated through the AFL office as we look to find new investors.\u201d\n\nThe Times Union reported that while all AFL players have been free agents since the season ended, per the league\u2019s collective bargaining agreement, team employees will receive two weeks\u2019 pay.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAll of us are going to keep playing until time runs out. No one\u2019s quitting yet,\u201d Boe told the newspaper. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that I think the odds are good, but no one is quitting.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou play until the final gun goes off, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. If we can come up with a way to keep the league going that makes sense for everyone, then we would do that.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The six-team league, including the Washington Valor and Baltimore Brigade, could become a traveling operation.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HutyE0TZXcWYYApSzNnTWknd6ZU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G2TPFJEFUBCAVHGSXCD6Z2WIWY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
