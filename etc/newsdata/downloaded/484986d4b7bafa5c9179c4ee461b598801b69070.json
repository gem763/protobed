That\u2019s sooooo 2010 though, darling, and if you don\u2019t know your Zulte Waragems (careful \u2013 Fiver Ed) from your FK Suduvas (ffs \u2013 Fiver Ed) then we\u2019re afraid we just can\u2019t help you. These days any self-respecting football whizz should be able to name the starting XIs of, say, Red Star Belgrade and Atalanta off the top of their heads \u2013 and, that being the case, have we got news for you!\n\nGenk\u2019s constant rebuilding work faces tough inspection by Liverpool | Tumaini Carayol Read more\n\nYes, tonight\u2019s a night to get you tapping your merino runners and twirling your vintage band T-shirt around your head. In north London, Tottenham host early-90s throwback Red Star tonight while Manchester City welcome the freewheeling Serie A swashbucklers from Bergamo, who not only boast an excellent name but kept The Fiver safely away from social interactions during its early teens during a memorable series of campaigns on Championship Manager Italia. You haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve spent your school holidays locked away praying for Maurizio Ganz and Tomas Locatelli to stay fit across a season.\n\nThis evening it\u2019s all about stark reality, though. In theory it should be a walk in the park for Tottenham against opponents who have shipped at least three goals in each of their last four visits to sides from Europe\u2019s biggest leagues. But nothing has come easily for Mauricio Pochettino and company in recent weeks. They really have to win this one, otherwise the kind of salvage operation they launched in last season\u2019s group stage will resemble a game of Fifa on easy mode. \u201cIn this type of period, our worst opponent is ourselves,\u201d he said yesterday. That might not have been the case if Darko Pancev or Dragan Stojkovic were around this time but, with the greatest respect to Richmond Boakye and one-time Liverpool slayer Milan Pavkov, it\u2019s fair to say any dithering from Davinson S\u00e1nchez or Jan Vertonghen holds as great a threat to Poch\u2019s supposedly parlous position as anything.\n\nUp in the north-west, expectations are being kept similarly in check even though Atalanta\u2019s beguiling attacking style has most notably brought six goals for their own opponents \u2013 Dinamo Zagreb and Shakhtar Donetsk, no less \u2013 in their group stage games to date. \u201cWe are still not ready,\u201d Pep Guardiola said at the weekend of City\u2019s chances to win the competition, although that logic is starting to wear a little thin during his fourth season in charge and at a time when most of Europe\u2019s traditional giants appear distinctly undercooked. This is as good a time for them as any, although Papu G\u00f3mez and his gang may yet have something to say about that tonight. A win for Atalanta would risk making the Italian club positively orthodox in the popular imagination; another entertaining trouncing might at least keep the ageing football hipster dream faintly alive for now.\n\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\n\nJoin Barry Glendenning for piping-hot MBM action of Tottenham 3-1 Red Star Belgrade, while Ben Fisher is at the helm for Manchester City 1-1 Atalanta.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n\u201cBull$hit\u201d \u2013 Granit Xhaka there, responding to Patrice Evra\u2019s claim on MNF \u2013 following the 1-0 defeat at Sheffield United \u2013 that Arsenal are mentally weak away from home.\n\nFIVER LETTERS\n\n\u201cNo truth in the rumour then that the Bulgaria job was initially offered to former Flyers goalie Ilya Bryzgalov then? It\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t have the time on his hands, or the money as Philadelphia are still paying him $1.643m per year until 2027 to not play for them even though he pulled on skates labelled \u201cDo One\u201d in 2013\u201d \u2013 Mike Allcock.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always believed that the mark of a true great is the ability to turn a game on its head. The unique spark who seems to be able to reinterpret the laws of physics, the laws of geometry or even the laws of the game and bend them to his will. So after yet another man of the match performance at Old Trafford (and elsewhere) last weekend (and pretty much every other weekend too) can anyone explain how VAR didn\u2019t make the Ballon D\u2019Or shortlist?\u201d \u2013 Adam Uncamus.\n\n\u201cI fear your correspondent (Fiver passim), Mike Wilner, is unaware of one of the laws of the game if he thought Ben Foster had all the time in the world to take a goal kick. Yellow and red cards would soon follow if he took a fraction of that time. Speaking of time and goalkeepers, when was the last occasion anyone saw a goalkeeper penalised for \u201ccontrolling the ball for more than six seconds before releasing it\u201d (Law 12)\u201d \u2013 Brian Ross, and nobody else.\n\nSend your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
