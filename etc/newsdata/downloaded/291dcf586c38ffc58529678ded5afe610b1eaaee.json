The stock closed yesterday at US$5.45 in New York and C$7.24 on the S&P/TSX Composite, claiming the title to the worst performing stock on the main Canadian exchange on the day.\n\nThe company, which is now recognized as the biggest cannabis producer in Canada, failed to meet not only analysts\u2019 expectations last week but missed its own revised guidance, which had been lowered in early August.\n\nAurora Cannabis price chart\n\nLast week, the Edmonton-based producer reported C$98.9 million (US$74.65 million) in net revenues for the quarter that ended June 30, a 417.8% increase from the C$19.1 million (US$14.42 million) in the same period last year. But the figure was below the company\u2019s own guidance target of C$100 million (US$75.48 million) to C$107 million (US$80.77 million). Analysts had expected net revenues of about C$108 million (US$81.52 million).\n\nThe company also reported a loss before interest, taxes and depreciation of C$11.7 million (US$8.83 million), not quite the prediction of a non-adjusted profit, which Aurora officials had targeted for this quarter.\n\nShortfall \"Shouldn't Have Happened\"\n\nIn a televised interview, Aurora\u2019s chief corporate officer Cam Battley said the revenue shortfall \u201cshouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d He went on to explain that the shortfall can be traced to \u201cnon-core\u201d revenues, which included analytical testing and patient counselling.\n\nAurora officials also did a little finger pointing at the persistent problems with the slow roll-out of licensed cannabis retail shops in Canada to explain the revenue figures. But company officials are optimist that the roll-out of the so-called 2.0 cannabis products \u2013 the oil, topicals and edibles \u2013 which will be legalized in Canada next month and scheduled to be available at the retail level by mid-December, will be much smoother given the retail network already in place.\n\nThe one metric from the latest earning report that slipped by with little fanfare that investors might want to keep an eye on is that fact that Aurora made it clear that it can firmly claim the title of the largest Canadian cannabis producer, in terms of volume grown, sales and revenue, surpassing the other big name in Canadian cannabis \u00ad\u2013 Canopy Growth (NYSE: ), (TSX: ).\n\nCanopy Growth Sales Stagnate\n\nAurora\u2019s sales from the last quarter almost doubled. In comparison, Canopy Growth\u2019s were stagnant. And Aurora is making gains in all sectors \u2013 medical, recreational and bulk sales, putting the company on a sound diversified footing.\n\nHow Aurora managed to become the sales leader was clear \u2013 it bought its way to the top. It purchased well-performing companies that had proven growing operations, and in doing so eliminated them as possible competitors. These companies included Medreleaf, Cannimed and Whistler Medical. This route to expansion came at a cost, though. Aurora has C$640 million (US$483.10 million) in debt and a healthy C$314 million (US$237 million) in operating losses.\n\nOf course, Canopy Growth is still the biggest cannabis company by market cap, with a value of US$9.67 billion (C$12.8 billion), compared to Aurora\u2019s US$5.58 billion (C$7.38 billion).\n\nThe market reaction to Aurora\u2019s results has been clear \u2013 investors are not pleased. The unavoidable question looms large: When will it show a profit? It\u2019s the same questions that casts a shadow over the entire sector and serves as a measure of investors\u2019 patience running thin.\n\nBut Aurora provided an answer. Again, given the market\u2019s reaction and the hit the company\u2019s stock price has taken, investors did not like it too much. In a televised interview Michael Singer, the company\u2019s executive chairman, said profitability could be reached by the second half of 2020, but he added a few caveats which all dealt with a retail sales improvements and a smooth edible and derivatives roll-out.\n\nCannTrust To Be Delisted Sept. 23\n\nAs anticipated, CannTrust Holdings (NYSE: ), (TSX: ) will be removed from Canada\u2019s main stock exchange index, the , on Sept. 23. The beleaguered Ontario-based cannabis grower has been in a freefall since earlier this summer when it was revealed it had been growing cannabis in unlicensed rooms in its greenhouses in Pelham, Ont.\n\nThat was the beginning of the downward spiral, with the company\u2019s stock sinking lower with every subsequent news report unearthing a deeper and deeper scandal. Now, the company awaits word on whether Health Canada will revoke its growing licences.\n\nThe news of the pending delisting, released late last Friday, caused the stock to fall again yesterday, losing about 7% on both the New York and Toronto stock exchanges. It closed yesterday at US$1.50 (C$1.99)\n\nCannTrust price chart\n\nCannTrust\u2019s delisting comes about 18 months after it was added to the TSX in March 2018. Inclusion on the exchange requires a company\u2019s shares available for trading, or float, to be 0.025% of the total value of the index. That figure usually hovers around the C$500 million (US$377.42 million) mark. CannTrust\u2019s market cap has tumbled to C$281.55 million (US$212.53 million).\n\nIn October 2018, a few days before marijuana was officially legalized in Canada, the stock hit its all-time high of C$15.50 (US$11.45).", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Investing.com (Brenda O'Farrell/Investing.com) covering: S&P/TSX Composite, Canopy Growth Corp, Aurora Cannabis Inc, CannTrust Holdings Inc.
