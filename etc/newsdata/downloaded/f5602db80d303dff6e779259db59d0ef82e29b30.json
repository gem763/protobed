(Doug Engle/Star-Banner via AP) More\n\nJones has been charged with 2nd degree murder in his wife's death. Authorities suspect he killed all five members of his family at the mobile home where they had been living in Summerfield, Florida, said Kayla Welch, a spokeswoman for the Marion County Sheriff's office.\n\nThe sheriff's office said Jones, who is on suicide watch, is also suspected of killing the children: Cameron Bowers, 10; Preston Bowers, 5; Mercalli Jones, 2; and Aiyana Jones, 1. Additional charges are pending in their deaths.\n\nCasei Jones' family reported her and her four children missing Saturday night. Nikki Jones said she hadn't seen or heard from her daughter and grandchildren for nearly six weeks and was concerned for their wellbeing, according to an arrest report.\n\nWhen deputies searched the home for the family, they noticed it had been vacant for several weeks and \"had the foul odor of decomposition.\" They quickly realized it was a likely crime scene, according to an arrest report from Florida authorities.\n\nSheriff Woods said his deputies put out a blast for authorities across the country to be on the lookout for Michael Jones. Police in Brantley County, Georgia, pulled his truck over Sunday night.\n\n\"He was found in Brantley and gave himself up pretty quickly when he was pulled over,\" Sheriff Woods said. \"The mother's body was found in the vehicle.\"\n\nThe sheriff would not say where they found the children's bodies or how the family was killed. The autopsies were conducted in Georgia, but the medical examiner there referred questions to Florida authorities.", "description": "When Georgia authorities pulled over a Florida driver during the weekend, they made a gruesome discovery in the back of the truck \u2014 the body of his decomposing wife.
