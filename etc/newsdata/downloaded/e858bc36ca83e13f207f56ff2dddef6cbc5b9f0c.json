The claim initially appeared on NASA\u2019s website last month, but was deleted shortly after posting. IBM challenged the claim then, and renewed its criticism this week, offering an official rebuttal arguing that a classical computer can actually perform the task in as little as 2.5 days. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: Quantum supremacy is when a quantum machine performs a task that exceeds the capacity of a traditional computer. If real, this is a major milestone\u2014perhaps one reason IBM is so keen to debunk the claim. The two firms are among a host of big players currently researching quantum computing, with Microsoft, Accenture and Baidu also among them. IBM\u2019s initial complaint was that the task was too narrow and devoid of practical use to usher in a new era of computing. Now, it\u2019s arguing the calculation is actually well within the capabilities of a traditional computer. Google hasn\u2019t yet responded to Big Blue\u2019s critique.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
