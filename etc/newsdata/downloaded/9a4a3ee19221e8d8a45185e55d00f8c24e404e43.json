The Manhattan D.A.\u2019s office has been seeking eight years of both personal and business tax returns from Trump as part of an investigation that\u2019s never been very clearly spelled out for the public. Still, a grand jury was convinced to make the request for the returns over a month ago and the President\u2019s legal team has been fighting it ever since.\n\nToday, the judge in the case threw out the objection from Trump\u2019s lawyers. They had claimed that the President had virtually full immunity from prosecution while in office. Obviously, the judge disagreed. (NBC News)\n\nA federal judge Monday rejected President Donald Trump\u2019s claim that he was immune from criminal investigations as part of his bid to block a subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney seeking eight years of personal and business tax returns. The judge, Victor Marrero, tossed the lawsuit Trump\u2019s legal team brought against District Attorney Cyrus Vance that argued Vance should not receive Trump\u2019s tax returns because \u201c\u2018[v]irtually all legal commenters agree\u2019 that a sitting President of the United States is not \u2018subject to the criminal process\u2019 while he is in office.\u201d In a 75-page order, Marrero called the presidential immunity Trump invoked in the lawsuit to stop the production of tax documents \u201cunqualified and boundless.\u201d\n\nJudge Marrero (a Clinton appointee) serves in the Southern District of New York, where many of the lawsuits and charges aimed at the President originate. His assertion that claims of presidential immunity are \u201cunqualified and boundless\u201d will be interesting to evaluate on appeal. The question of whether or not the President really is immune from any form of prosecution or arrest while serving in office is an old one that\u2019s been argued for as long as the republic has existed. You can find legal scholars both agreeing and disagreeing, sometimes depending on which party currently holds power.\n\nOf course, it might be more useful to know precisely what they\u2019re thinking of charging Trump with. Thus far, all of the statements released from the DA\u2019s office simply claim that the matter is related to \u201cpayments made to two women who allegedly had affairs with the president.\u201d If these were payments made as part of more NDAs lurking in Trump\u2019s closet, I\u2019m not sure what criminal charges they could be referring to unless we\u2019re bringing back New York\u2019s old blue laws against adultery.\n\nEither way, now that the judge has kicked Trump\u2019s motion, his legal team will need to move fast if they want to avoid the document dump. One journalist from Bloomberg stated earlier today that the appeal would need to be filed almost immediately under the terms of a previous agreement. Otherwise, the documents would start flowing to the court in a matter of days if not hours.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 UPDATE \u2014> Trump has filed an emergency appeal with a federal appeals court. Unless he can win a delay by a 1 p.m. deadline previously agreed to by his lawyers, Vance may soon start receiving at least some of the materialhttps://t.co/CB1q55fNtM @CBerthelsenBBG @BobVanVoris https://t.co/XvkGb11jGr \u2014 David S.
