Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney, George Mesires, released a statement earlier Sunday that said the younger Biden intends to resign from the board of directors of BHR Partners by Oct. 31.\n\nThe statement also said Hunter Biden promises to avoid conflicts of interest if his father is elected president, and will continue to keep the former vice president out of his business affairs.\n\nAt the forum, Joe Biden continued to stress that he has not discussed his son\u2019s business affairs with him, adding that he was not aware of what was in Mesires\u2019 statement until he read it upon release.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m not going to let you all do is let you take the focus off the problem,\u201d Biden told reporters at the UFCW forum. \u201cNo one has asserted my son did a single thing wrong. No one has asserted that I\u2019ve done anything wrong except the lying president. That\u2019s the only thing. That\u2019s the focus.\u201d\n\n2/\u201c...

The younger Biden\u2019s attorney has maintained that no law enforcement agency has ever accused his client of wrongdoing during his time on the board.\n\nIn a July phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s work in the country while his father, now one of Trump\u2019s political rivals, was vice president.\n\nTrump\u2019s phone call, and his request that a foreign government interfere in the 2020 U.S. election, is part of what sparked the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into the president for abusing the power of his office to benefit his reelection campaign. Trump has repeatedly defended his actions and denied any wrongdoing, saying that the call was \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nBiden announced last week that he believes Trump should be impeached. He was one of the last 2020 Democrats to say so.", "description": "The 2020 Democrat's comments at a UFCW forum came hours after his son Hunter Biden resigned from the board of a Chinese-backed firm.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da3ae562100004207344af5.jpeg?cache=jw3xhaak7g&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
