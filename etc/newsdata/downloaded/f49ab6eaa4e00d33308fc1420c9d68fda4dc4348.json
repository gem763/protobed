The virus wipes out the entire political leadership, except one old man, who has survived on account of his age, but may also be too old to handle the awesome task before him.\n\nNow suppose \u2014 and I am not certain this is the case, but just suppose \u2014 that this is happening to the Democratic presidential campaign. The virus is Twitter, and the old man is (duh) Joe Biden.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 elections, an exotic political theory promoted by the party\u2019s most left-wing flank suddenly gained wide circulation. The appeal of Bernie Sanders proved Democrats were ready to embrace socialism, or at least something close to it; and Donald Trump\u2019s election proved a nominee with extreme positions could still win. These two conclusions, in combination, suggested the party would move as far left as activists preferred at no political cost.\n\nNeither of these conclusions was actually correct. The Bernie Sanders vote encompassed voters who opposed Hillary Clinton for a wide array of reasons \u2014 including that she was too liberal \u2014 and were overall slightly to the right of Clinton voters. And political-science findings that general election voters tend to punish more ideologically extreme candidates remain very much intact. (Trump benefited greatly by distancing himself rhetorically from his party\u2019s unpopular small-government positions, and voters saw him as more moderate than previous Republican nominees, even though he predictably reverted to partisan form once in office.)\n\nAnd yet, this analysis seemed to race unchallenged through the Democratic Party from about 2016 \u2014 it seemed to influence Clinton, who declined the traditional lurch toward the center after vanquishing Sanders \u2014 through this year. Through sheer force of repetition, it achieved the status of a kind of self-evident truth:\n\nMy 'interactions' are full of people asserting things like: there are no swing voters; the only thing that changed in 2018 is turnout, Democrats can't and haven't won over any Trump voters. And whatever you think of the optimal strategy for Democrats, this is all facially untrue \u2014 Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) September 10, 2019\n\nBy the beginning of 2019, most of the Democratic field had absorbed this new conventional wisdom. The field was racing left, treating the consensus on progressive Twitter as though it were a simulacrum of the real Democratic Party. On some issues, like a higher minimum wage and more generous Social Security benefits, bold left-wing positions really do capture strong political majorities. But on other issues, many candidates have exposed themselves to damaging general election attacks: on reparations for slavery, decriminalizing the border, and giving health-care coverage to undocumented immigrants, among others.\n\nHere is Kirsten Gillibrand rattling off social-justice lingo last month:\n\nI don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s the responsibility of Cory and Kamala to be the only voice that takes all of these issues of institutional racism, systemic racism in our country. I think as a white woman of privilege who is a U.S. senator running for president of the United States, it is also my responsibility to lift up those voices that aren\u2019t being listened to. And I can talk to those white women in the suburbs that voted for Trump and explain to them what white privilege actually is, that when their son is walking down a street with a bag of M&Ms in his pocket wearing a hoodie, his whiteness is what protects him from not being shot.\n\nIt was a perfect encapsulation of Gillibrand\u2019s campaign, which seemed to be positioning the candidate to be elected President of Twitter. Her campaign posted the clip and got more than 1,000 likes, as well as favorable coverage of the remarks in outlets like Vox, Mother Jones, and the New York Times op-ed page.\n\nA certain number of activists thrilled at the sight of a presidential candidate using the concepts and terms of the social-justice left. As a messaging strategy for building an electoral majority, though, it could charitably be called risky. None of the 40 Democrats who flipped Republican House districts in 2018 ran on a message of calling out white women for their privilege. Not long after this apparently triumphal moment, Gillibrand had to drop out of the race.\n\n++\n\nNowhere was the gap between perception and reality more dramatic than on health care. In the run-up to the primary, most of the field signed on to Bernie Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All plan. Sanders had not managed to work out solutions to the obstacles that have bedeviled single-payer health-care supporters for decades: How to assure Americans who currently have employer-sponsored insurance to accept higher taxes and that they\u2019ll be happier on a public plan.\n\nKamala Harris has had second thoughts, and has twisted herself into a pretzel trying to wriggle away from the proposal. Cory Booker has largely avoided discussing it. Elizabeth Warren was signaling last year that she would support more moderate reforms, but has instead handcuffed herself to the Sanders plan.\n\nThe vulnerabilities of this position have been on bright display in every Democratic debate. Neither Warren nor Sanders could supply a coherent response to the question of whether middle-class voters would pay higher taxes or whether they would like being moved off their employer plan. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anybody who likes their health-insurance company,\u201d Warren insisted, eliding the clear reality that most people who have employer-sponsored insurance do like it. When asked about higher taxes, they dodged by changing the question to total costs. And while it\u2019s probably true that they could design a plan where higher wages \u2014 by taking insurance of the company books \u2014 would cancel out the high taxes, neither inspired confidence that they could persuade skeptical voters they\u2019d come out ahead in the deal.\n\nThe odd thing about this race to the left is that there\u2019s little evidence it appeals to the primary electorate, let alone the general election version. Democrats strongly support universal coverage, but have lukewarm feelings on the mechanism to attain this. They prefer reforms that involve a combination of public and private options over the Bernie movement\u2019s manic obsession with crushing private health insurance.\n\nThis applies as well to the party\u2019s general ideological orientation. More Democratic voters express concern the party will nominate a candidate who\u2019s too liberal (49 percent) than one who\u2019s not liberal enough (41 percent). By a similar 54\u201341 margin, more Democrats want their party to move toward the center than toward the left.\n\n\u201cResponding to a Democratic electorate that has been radicalized by Donald Trump and is still smarting from the 2008 recession, Warren and Sanders have yanked the conversation \u2014 and the party \u2014 sharply to the left,\u201d exults The Nation\u2019s Jeet Heer, treating the premise that Democratic voters demand a leftward tilt as so self-evident he needn\u2019t bother substantiating it. \u201cPoliticians often deemed moderate such as Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris have joined the policy arms race, with candidates trying to top one another with their competing plans to remake America.\u201d\n\nThe metaphor \u201cpolicy arms race,\u201d which he borrows from Paul Waldman, is worth lingering over. An arms race is a dynamic in which competitors are forced to devote more of their resources to defense lest they fall behind. It is a negative-sum dynamic, in which both sides are trapped into harmful behavior. Even hawks like Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan recognized the inherent dangers of an arms race.\n\n++\n\nA recent Politico story by Ryan Lizza conveys the frustration Biden\u2019s campaign feels with the news media, which generally reflects the cultural and, to a lesser extent, ideological perspective of the party\u2019s activists. They complain the coverage has drawn a portrait of Biden as a stumbling loser, surviving on a combination of name recognition and Obama nostalgia, fighting off the party\u2019s rising progressive tide.\n\nThere is some real merit to this complaint \u2014 especially the notion that \u201cideas\u201d are an exclusive asset of his opponents. It seems just as likely that many of Biden\u2019s supporters have a positive appreciation for compromise and pluralism, designing policies that appeal to wide social and economic swaths of the country, rather than those that draw sharp cleavages between winners and losers.\n\nBut if Biden has this ideological territory to himself, it raises the possibility he could win the nomination simply because his opponents abandoned the field. What if all his major competition raced to the left, succumbing to the fashionable delusion that the party rank and file demanded a Bernie-like nominee? And what if the only self-styled moderates in the race (Michael Bennet, Amy Klobuchar, John Hickenlooper, and so on) lacked the name recognition to mount a credible challenge?\n\nIndeed, two candidates seem to have realized this problem. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have dropped out of the left-wing arms race and begun positioning themselves as heirs to the Obama style of optimism and uplift. But it\u2019s already getting late, and each candidate has already devoted most of the time between their launch and the Iowa caucuses trying to avoid getting dragged on Twitter. What\u2019s more, the fact that both Harris and Booker are trying to squeeze into the same political space increases the probability that neither will achieve escape velocity.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden looks like a candidate hoping to somehow stagger across the finish line. He has campaigned at a leisurely pace. His first debate performance was disastrous. The next two started out vigorous, but saw him slowly flag as the evening wore on. Thursday night included a rambling answer in which he urged parents to \u201cmake sure you have the record player on at night.\u201d Biden\u2019s lack of awareness of Twitter may be to his benefit, but it\u2019s more disturbing if he lacks a working knowledge of such innovations as the compact disc player.\n\nIf Biden isn\u2019t up to this, he needs to collapse soon enough for another mainstream liberal Democrat like Booker or Harris to take his place. Yet it\u2019s at least as easy to imagine he will stay in the race, locking down the party\u2019s center, while Sanders and Warren continue to try to outflank each other on the left. There\u2019s still some time for the race to change. At the moment, the most dire scenario looks disconcertingly real.", "description": "The Democratic presidential primary field has been a race to the left led by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are too far left, with the main centrist alternative being Joe Biden, who may be too old.
