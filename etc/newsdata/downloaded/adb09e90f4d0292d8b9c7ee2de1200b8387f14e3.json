Leo Santa Cruz didn\u2019t want to know, so that left us slightly out in the cold.\n\nTo go back to Elland Road next year we have to have a second world title on the line. WBC champion Gary Russell Jr is a possible opponent, but the problem with him is he only fights once a year. There\u2019s also the option to move Josh up in weight. The main thing is to beat Sofiane Takoucht this weekend and make sure we don\u2019t get stuck with another mandatory.\n\nThe IBF can be a pain when it comes to their mandatories. One thing is for sure, I don\u2019t want to inflict Kid Galahad on the fans again. It\u2019s a total liberty to get a final eliminator on the back of a loss. Completely baffling.\n\nWarrington is back in action this weekend (Picture: Getty)\n\nDerek Chisora vs David Price is a fight we\u2019ll be watching closely. Joe Joyce or Daniel Dubois could fight the winner. We already offered Price the chance to fight Dubois or Joyce and he turned it down. I offered David Haye a large sum of money for Joyce to step in for Joseph Parker and they picked Price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChisora-Price is a good fight because you have no idea which version of either man will turn up. I\u2019d back both Dubois or Joyce to beat either of them.\n\nNot sure Chisora-Price could possibly be billed as a pay-per-view, but the world\u2019s gone mad these days. Case and point: KSI vs Logan Paul. I\u2019ve got no problem with these two kids wanting to fight each other. They\u2019ll make a load of money in the process and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s white collar boxing really.\n\nWhat I do have an issue with is Eddie Hearn and co selling it like it\u2019s a world class boxing event on pay-per-view. Surely we\u2019ve got to have some standards, no? Hearn himself slagged it off when they fought last year. Now I\u2019m the dinosaur? Spare me the hypocrisy.\n\nHearn is promoting KSI and Logan Paul\u2019s rematch (Picture: Reuters)\n\nIf KSI and Logan Paul want a real fight I\u2019m sure I can convince Anthony Yarde to knock them both out on the same night. Maybe I\u2019ll join the circus too and promote Piers Morgan vs Jeremy Clarkson. Give me a break!\n\nOne fight that will be worth watching is Oleksandr Usyk\u2019s debut. I\u2019m keen to see how he gets on because if he can make the jump to heavyweight then he\u2019d be a great opponent for Tyson Fury. The problem is Usyk isn\u2019t the biggest guy, although he won\u2019t be troubled by Chazz Witherspoon. It\u2019ll be another four fights until we see if he can mix it at heavyweight, but I\u2019m looking forward to finding out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTickets for Warrington vs Takoucht on Saturday Oct 12th are available via Ticketmaster.co.uk", "description": "Josh Warrington has made it clear I must deliver a unification fight for him and I intend to do just that in 2020.
