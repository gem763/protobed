De Klerk was at Waterkloof High in Pretoria, and just been made part of the Blue Bulls youth systems.\n\nDuane Vermeulen (then 21): It was the year Vermeulen shifted from the Pumas to the Cheetahs, to really begin his domestic \u201cvisibility\u201d in many senses. It still seems unfathomable, in retrospect, that his Test debut would only come five years later in 2012, though.\n\nPieter-Steph du Toit (then 15): A pupil at Swartland High in Malmesbury, he was four years short of being snapped up as a promising youngster by the Sharks - and, one year further onward (2012), a triumphant member of SA\u2019s then-IRB Junior World Championship-winning team.\n\nSiya Kolisi (then 16): Presumably on a weekend break from PE\u2019s Grey High School when he watched the game in the township tavern, he was being raised by his grandmother Nolulamile at the time, his mother having died a year earlier. His own mini-triumph in that landmark 2007 was entering the EP Kings\u2019 youth plans.\n\nLood de Jager (then 14): The lanky lock would either have started already or been about to tackle high school at Hugenote (Springs). He was still four years short of Leopards youth rugby involvement.\n\nEben Etzebeth (then 15): Nine days short of his 16th birthday, the lock meanie would have been at Tygerberg High and some four years short of first nationwide TV exposure, playing for Ikey Tigers in the Varsity Cup.\n\nFrans Malherbe (then 16): He was at Paarl Boys\u2019 High, who he would later lead to first-team success in the big derby against \u201cGimmies\u201d, although it would require one more World Cup cycle, to the 2011 year, for him to earn debuts for both WP and the Stormers.\n\nBongi Mbonambi (then 16): The feisty hooker was at St Alban\u2019s College in Pretoria, and had just hooked up with the Griffons at youth level.\n\nTendai Mtawarira (then 22): Now a record-breaking Sharks servant, the popular Bok loosehead prop had made his Super Rugby debut that 2007 year, while it would only be a few months onward (June 2008) when he debuted for South Africa - the first of currently 116 caps.\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "<strong>Rob Houwing's</strong> reminder of the statuses, 12 years ago when SA met England in their last RWC final duel, of the current Bok first-teamers contemplating it this time.", "authors": ["Rob Houwing", "Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4402/75f332e57f714858bb972f5b9089a3f3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
