Clearly you had an organised group of people making Nazi salutes and monkey chants, visible to anyone who was watching the television feed.\n\n(Image: Sportimage)\n\n\"And then the (first step of UEFA's anti-racism) protocol being activated, and then (supporters) streaming out, seemingly nonchalant to the impact they were having, I thought it was terrible.\n\n\"I thought that ITV, the players, Gareth and the FA dealt with it in an exemplary fashion.\"\n\nNo Room For Racism involves the Premier League, the Football Association, the EFL, the Professional Footballers' Association and anti-racism campaign group Kick It Out.\n\nThe Premier League is working to help make reporting of discriminatory behaviour easier, and is developing training for stewards to respond to such reports effectively.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAway from events in stadiums, another major issue this season from a domestic point of view has been social media abuse directed at Premier League players such as Abraham, Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba.\n\nMasters says discussions are ongoing with Twitter and says the social media giant is \"really trying\" to stamp down on racist abuse on the platform.\n\nHe added: \"Our fans share the belief that racism has no place in football or wider society, but discrimination still exists among a minority.\n\n\"We will not tolerate racism in any form and urge anybody who witnesses racist behaviour to report it.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nKick It Out has pledged its support to the initiative, and will continue to run its own campaigns independently.\n\nA Kick It Out spokesman said: \"We're pleased to see the Premier League continue their work to tackle racism in football through their No Room For Racism campaign, which includes a commitment to promoting reporting methods such as the Kick It Out app.\n\n\"Kick It Out works closely with the Premier League, as well as the EFL, the FA and PFA, and as such will always support their efforts to make football a more inclusive place for all.\n\n\"As an independent charity, we will continue to run our own campaigns to tackle all forms of discrimination and throughout this season, professional clubs in England will once again be dedicating a fixture to our work under the theme of our new #KickItOutGeneration campaign.\"", "description": "Players such as Sterling, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Tammy Abraham and Teemu Pukki will take a stand against racism at this weekend's Premier League games", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Georgi Licovski Epa-Efe Rex", "Sportimage", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645016.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_UEFA-EURO-2020-Sofia-Bulgaria-14-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
