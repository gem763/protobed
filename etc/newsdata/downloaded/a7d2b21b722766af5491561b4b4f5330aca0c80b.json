This decline is due to a decrease in daily referrals over the last few months, and ORR\u2019s ability to maintain a steady high discharge rate of UAC placement with sponsors,\u201d he testified.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnsnews.Com News Article Melanie-Arter Hhs-Number-Unaccompanied-Minors-Entering-Us-Reached-Highest-History"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
