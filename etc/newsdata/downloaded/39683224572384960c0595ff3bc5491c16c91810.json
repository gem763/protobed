The benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> rose 1.3% on Thursday, closing just 1.75% away from its record high in July.\n\nAnalysts have said that weak jobs numbers could put more pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by as much as 50-basis points in its mid-September meeting. Market participants are currently expecting a quarter percentage point cut.\n\nAt 7:08 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis <1YMcv1> were up 84 points, or 0.31%.
