Chowdhury said Humphries must take her concerns to the Sports Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada (SDRCC) first.\n\nBut Jeffrey Rath, Humphries' lawyer, says because her contract expired in June, those rules don't apply.\n\nCompeting for the U.S. is Humphries' only option, Rath argued.\n\n\"Bobsleigh Canada has made it clear they don't want her to compete for them,\" Rath told the judge.\n\nHumphries 'driven off' team: lawyer\n\nThe two-time Olympic gold medallist is one of Canada's most decorated athletes.\n\nA year ago, Humphries filed a harassment complaint with Bobsleigh Canada, alleging verbal and mental abuse from her former coach, Todd Hays, in the 2017-18 season. She now lives in the United States and wants to compete for that country.\n\nAccording to her lawyer, Humphries was essentially \"driven off\" the Canadian bobsled team after filing the complaint.\n\nIf Humphries is to compete for the United State Bobsled and Skeleton Federation (USBSF) in the 2019-20 season, she needs the release letter from Bobsleigh Canada and an acceptance letter from USBSF by Sept. 30.\n\nPunitive behaviours alleged\n\nBy allowing Hays's abusive behaviour, the suit alleges he and Bobsleigh Canada were in breach of their contracts.\n\nHumphries has been waiting for more than a year for the national sport organization to complete its internal investigation.\n\nIn her statement of claim, Humphries says that after filing the complaint, Hays took actions to ensure she would not compete with Bobsleigh Canada.\n\nHumphries was not invited to training camps and was told that if she tried to compete for Canada, she'd be given an older sled that would not have been competitive or safe, according to the claim.\n\nThe document also claims other athletes were threatened with blacklisting if they worked with Humphries.\n\nHumphries 'has suffered and continues to suffer monetary damages in the form of loss of reputation, sponsorships, revenue opportunities including branding opportunities and economic losses,\" reads the statement of claim.", "description": "The investigation into Kaillie Humphries' harassment complaint against her former coach and Bobsleigh Canada has been completed, with a finding that her allegations have not been substantiated,\u00a0a Calgary judge heard in court Monday.", "authors": ["Cbc Calgary Reporter", "Meghan Grant Is The Courts", "Crime Reporter For Cbc Calgary.", "Follow Her On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5281735.1568326714!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/humphries-kaillie.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
