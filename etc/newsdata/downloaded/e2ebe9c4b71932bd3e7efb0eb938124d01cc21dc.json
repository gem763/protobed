Fonda has vowed to get arrested every Friday for the rest of the year to protest against climate change. Last week, she was arrested on Capitol Hill and charged with \"crowding, obstructing, or incommoding.\"\n\nThe octogenarian says she was inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Thurnberg told world leaders that humanity was facing \"mass extinction\" and asked world leaders to take tougher action to stop climate change.\n\nPresident Trump courted controversy with a tweet about how Thunberg was \"looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.\"\n\nShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.
