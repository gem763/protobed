Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) made sure reproductive rights were included in the discussion about health care during Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate.\n\n\u201cThis is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word \u2015 with all of these discussions about health care \u2015 on women\u2019s access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack in America today,\u201d the presidential contender said.\n\nAlthough she never used the word \u201cabortion,\u201d Harris was referring to the onslaught of anti-abortion legislation that has passed in states across the country in the last six months. States including Alabama, Georgia, Ohio and Missouri have banned abortions as early as the first trimester.\n\nKamala Harris: \"It's not an exaggeration to say women will die \u2014 poor women, women of color will die \u2014 because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with their bodies\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/rtyjHfQnBT \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 16, 2019\n\nThe senator said it\u2019s \u201coutrageous\u201d that reproductive health care has not been included in ongoing conversations about health care in the presidential debate.\n\n\u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say women will die \u2014 poor women, women of color will die \u2014because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cPeople need to keep their hands off of women\u2019s bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives,\u201d Harris said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about that. That is a significant health care issue in America today.\u201d\n\nMoments later, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) added support to Harris\u2019 comment, calling the war on abortion rights a \u201cclear and existential threat in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are seeing all over this country women\u2019s reproductive rights under attack, and God bless Kamala, but you know what? Women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd men, it is not just because women are our daughters and our friends and our wives, it\u2019s because women are people and people deserve to control their own bodies.\u201d", "description": "\u201cPeople need to keep their hands off of women\u2019s bodies and let women make the decisions about their lives,\" Harris said at the Democratic presidential de...", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da6688d210000510fad1a20.jpeg?cache=cnygiusfmf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
