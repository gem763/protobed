Gold\u2019s Rally Is Driving a Rush to One of Metal\u2019s Final Frontiers\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Step aside Canada, Australia and South Africa: West Africa is fast becoming the hottest ticket in gold mining.\n\nProducers and prospectors are pouring money into the region as prices rally and the industry at the southern tip of the continent keeps shrinking. While gold miners face a dearth of new discoveries globally, large parts of West Africa have barely been explored. The deposits tend to be shallow -- meaning easy access -- and relatively low-cost.\n\nAt least two new projects started up this year and a further two are scheduled for 2020. AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. is also expanding and modernizing its Obuasi mine in Ghana and Canada\u2019s Iamgold Corp. is considering a new operation in Senegal. In July, Resolute Mining Ltd. agreed to buy another West Africa-focused producer.\n\nAt the center of the action are the Birimian belts, tracts of ancient, gold-rich volcanic rock that stretch from the fringes of the Sahara to the Atlantic coast. While West Africa has a long tradition of gold mining -- Ghana was known as the Gold Coast under British colonial rule -- the vastness of the region and political insecurity in some areas mean its riches remain mostly untapped.\n\nRead: Africa\u2019s Biggest Fund Manager Sees Gold Boom in West Africa\n\n\u201cWest Africa is brimming with potential,\u201d said Kelvin Dushnisky, the chief executive officer of the world\u2019s No. 3 gold producer AngloGold. \u201cOur Obuasi mine is a spectacular orebody that will be a significant production engine for Ghana and AngloGold for many years to come.\u201d\n\nBoth of AngloGold's (JO: ) larger rivals, Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE: ) and Newmont Goldcorp Corp. (NYSE: ), also have mines in the region, and Newmont recently completed an expansion project in Ghana.\n\nRead: Nation Built on Gold Loses Its African Crown to Rival Ghana\n\nInvestment, especially in exploration, slowed across the industry after gold prices came off the highs seen in 2011 and 2012, and most producers were focused on cutting debt and lowering costs rather than new spending.\n\nNow, with back around $1,500 and ounce, there\u2019s more money to go around.\n\nMost of West Africa\u2019s gold deposits have yet to be found and mined, according to Oumar Toguyeni, Iamgold\u2019s vice president for the region.\n\n\u201cIf you are looking for gold in West Africa, you go to the Birimian belt,\u201d Toguyeni said by phone from Mali. \u201cThe potential is still there as the region remains under explored. It\u2019s the easier deposits that were found.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, West Africa also has its challenges, as a surge of attacks by al-Qaeda and Islamic State-linked insurgents threatens to curb exploration and mining.\n\nTerrorist Threats\n\nTerrorist threats from Mali to Burkina Faso have spread to border areas with Ghana and Ivory Coast as Islamist militants seek to extend their influence. In January, the body of an executive of Vancouver-based Progress Minerals Inc. was found with bullet wounds after being kidnapped from an exploration site in the northeast of Burkina Faso.\n\nThere are also more conventional challenges. A lack of skilled workers and basic infrastructure such as electricity supplies and roads makes mines more expensive to build, Toguyeni said.\n\nRead: Islamist Insurgencies Feed Age-Old West African Conflicts\n\nStill, once projects are up and running, there\u2019s good money to be made. Gold Fields Ltd. produces at a cost of about $950 an ounce at its Tarkwa mine in Ghana, said CEO Nick Holland.\n\nOnce the waste rock is stripped away, \u201cthere is quite a lot of meat on the bone to go for,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can manage costs and be efficient, open pits, it\u2019s great business.\u201d\n\nSeveral smaller companies are exploring for gold in West Africa, aiming to either develop their own mines or find a buyer once a discovery is made, said Cora Gold Ltd. CEO Jon Forster.\n\nCora is exploring a deposit in Mali and believes it can get investor support for a mine, said Forster, a veteran geologist who has worked in West Africa for about 25 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the world\u2019s great gold provinces, he said. \u201cThis gives investors the confidence that you can take a project from exploration stage to mining.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a list of projects in the region:", "description": "Gold\u2019s Rally Is Driving a Rush to One of Metal\u2019s Final Frontiers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED4U0TY-ORUBS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
