That means Friday's GDP number wasn't all that surprising.\n\nTechnology stocks were faring particularly poorly on Friday, because many American tech companies rely on China's rapidly expanding middle class for their profit and sales growth.\n\nStill, Friday's selloff pales in comparison to some days dominated by trade headlines.\n\nTrade has been the main driver of the market for months.
