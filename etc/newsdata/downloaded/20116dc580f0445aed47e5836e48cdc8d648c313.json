Now he is using his expertise to clear land in rural Cambodia and make it safe again\n\nThe rusty tailfin of the mortar round can be seen poking through the roots and mud of a small dirt patch, next to a skull and crossbones sign.\n\nAki Ra thinks the bomb could have been lying in rural Siem Reap, Cambodia, for 40 years. If it hadn\u2019t been found, it may have added another death to the approximately 20,000 people killed by explosives laid in the country from the late 1960s to the 1990s.\n\nRa, founder of Cambodian Self Help Demining (CSHD), and his team have found about 100 explosives in the two months they\u2019ve been sweeping this 23-acre (9.5-hectare) site in Chi Kraeng district. Despite handling the devices every day since 2008, when the CSHD was formed, none of its workers have been injured by them.\n\n\u201cJust by cobras,\u201d Ra says. \u201cWe cut grass, cobra lives there, bites hand. I cut the skin, push blood out. Three times, no deaths.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aki Ra founded Cambodian Self Help Demining to clear mines in rural areas\n\nUnimpeded by snakes today, Ra\u2019s team dig around the bomb then carry it to a deeper hole. They move back to the safe end of a 100-metre wire attached to the projectile. Whistles, warning shouts \u2013 kaboom! Another one down, up to 6m in Cambodia to go.\n\nThe Cambodian government wants the country free of landmines and unexploded ordnance by 2025.\n\nBut with landmine casualties rising in Cambodia \u2013 62 in the first half of 2019, up from 31 in the same period in 2018 \u2013 the goal seems unrealistic, if urgent.\n\nA woman introduced as Mrs Yorn had her left leg blown off by a mine hidden in foliage a few metres from her house when she was a teenager. She set off another when cutting grass, sending shrapnel tearing through her mouth. Hobbling with a crutch outside her wooden house, which backs onto minefields, Yorn, now 55, says her life is \u201cdifficult. Sometimes it hurts a lot because there are still fragments [of metal from landmines] in my body.\u201d\n\nRa\u2019s mine-clearing team offers basic medical help to poor villagers they work near, as an extra service to those who can\u2019t afford to travel to hospitals or buy medical equipment and medicine. However, removing metal embedded inside bodies is beyond their skill set.\n\n\u201cI had a better life before I lost my leg,\u201d says Yorn. \u201cI worked hard and had a lot of food.\u201d Now her family largely relies on charity \u2013 Ra sends an associate to his car to fetch a blanket and some money, as a donation. Yorn and a few of her young grandchildren press their hands together in thanks, as he returns to the vehicle.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mrs Yorn has sustained injuries from mines near her house, including damage to her mouth\n\nPoor villagers such as Yorn are forced to live on land that\u2019s cheap because it is littered with mines.\n\nWith 40 employees working across 10 provinces, the CSHD, which says it has cleared 175 minefields in the country since forming in 2008, targets villages overlooked by larger NGOs and the government\u2019s Cambodian Mine Action Authority.\n\n\u201cAnother village needs us soon,\u201d says Ra, as his team breaks for a quick meal of rice and fish. \u201cIf we stay too long, other villagers aren\u2019t happy. So we have to move.\u201d\n\nSoldier to sweeper\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to view Ra\u2019s career as a story of redemption. In the mid-1970s, aged around 10 (he\u2019s not sure of his age, but thinks he\u2019s 45), he was recruited by Pol Pot\u2019s Khmer Rouge. His parents were among the millions of Cambodians murdered by the regime.\n\nRa waged jungle warfare against incoming Vietnamese forces, laying mines around Siem Reap. He wrote about the brutality of Khmer Rouge communes, but says that after he was handed an AK47 things improved. \u201cI was happy to lay mines \u2026 the guns looked like toys. Machine guns, artillery, grenades, rockets \u2026 explosions and bangs were like music, drums. We were happy singing songs and fighting.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The CSHD team says it has cleared 175 minefields since forming in 2008\n\nFun with guns didn\u2019t convert to true loyalty to the Khmer Rouge\u2019s genocidal vision, and in the early 1980s Ra was convinced to join Vietnam forces. After the Vietnamese withdrew in 1990 he joined Cambodia\u2019s national army, then as fighting subsided he helped civilian volunteers clearing mines.\n\nMetal detectors were not available back then. \u201cI made a tool to unscrew mines with,\u201d Ra says. \u201cThen we\u2019d use grass or wood to burn and destroy them.\u201d\n\nHe was motivated by repeatedly witnessing the devices\u2019 deadly effects. \u201cWhen some people lose a leg, at first they don\u2019t know there\u2019s been an explosion. Then the smoke finishes and they understand: \u2018Oh, my leg is gone.\u2019 Then the pain. During the war, some people had both legs blown up then would kill themselves. I\u2019d say, \u2018Stop, my friend!\u2019, but they\u2019d shoot.\u201d\n\nRa cleared mines with the UN when it sent peacekeeping forces to Cambodia in the early 1990s. \u201cThe UN showed me that the outside world has schools, hospitals, food. Then I understood. I threw out the bad things of the past. I wanted to make my country safe.\u201d\n\nRealising he had a knack for handling explosives \u2013 plus a stockpile of defused mines he charged tourists a dollar to see \u2013 Ra opened the Cambodia Landmine Museum near Angkor Wat in 1997. He and his wife, Hourt, added a small orphanage, relocating the museum just north of Siem Reap city in 2007.\n\nWith funding from US charity Landmine Relief Fund, Ra founded the CSHD. His actions saw him hailed a hero, but recently earned him less welcome attention.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A painting by Aki Ra, inspired by the times he had witnessed landmines\u2019 deadly effects\n\nIn August 2018, a small fire in Ra\u2019s museum compound led police to discover grenades, bullets and mines that are illegal to own in Cambodia. Ra was detained on firearms charges, and the museum was closed for three months as officials considered its licensed status.\n\nRa already had an uneasy relationship with authorities. His work, and that of other NGOs, highlighted the government\u2019s failure to fully deal with landmines since Prime Minister Hun Sen came to power in 1985. The government says it needs huge foreign donations for landmine clearing. Meanwhile photos of the prime minister wearing a wristwatch worth millions of dollars have circulated online.\n\nWith government critics regularly arrested in Cambodia, Ra is understandably reluctant to talk about brushes with the law. He will say that rice meals in jail were \u201cnot fresh\u201d, and that during his detainment he slept \u2013 or rather didn\u2019t sleep \u2013 in a room with 30 other inmates. \u201cI\u2019m OK,\u201d he says. \u201cI follow the rule. The rule can take me to jail.\u201d\n\nAvoiding a lengthy conviction, Ra was eventually able to re-open his museum and get back to work. He has many years of mine clearing left in him, but hopes that the CSHD will eventually be taken over by some or all of his three children. He named his second child Mine.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ra in his early mine clearing days in Cambodia\n\nRa isn\u2019t short of admirers, such as 33-year-old Hak Hort. In the late 1990s Hort\u2019s right leg was blown off by a mine that killed his brother and sister. He met Ra when he visited Hort\u2019s village near Siem Reap to clear mines. Hort then went to live in the orphanage.\n\n\u201cI was happy to live with him \u2013 it meant I could go to school,\u201d says Hort during a visit to Ra\u2019s museum. About 100 children have passed through the orphanage so far.\n\nLooking at a painting depicting a group of bodies mutilated by mines, next to sobbing villagers, Hort adds: \u201cHe\u2019s helped a lot of people.\u201d", "description": "Aki Ra was a child soldier for Pol Pot, laying mines around Siem Reap.
