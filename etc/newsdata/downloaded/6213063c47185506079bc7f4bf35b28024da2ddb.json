Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., March 1, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said on Wednesday that Facebook\u2019s (FB.O) efforts to launch a Libra cryptocurrency must overcome a \u201ccore set of legal and regulatory challenges\u201d before facilitating a single payment.\n\nBrainard added that central banks\u2019 efforts to conduct monetary policy could be \u201ccomplicated\u201d by widespread adoption of an external stablecoin like Libra. But she suggested the Fed is in no rush to issue its own digital currency, saying it raises \u201cprofound legal, policy and operational questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should be no surprise that Facebook\u2019s Libra is attracting a high level of scrutiny from lawmakers and authorities,\u201d she said at an event in Washington, according to prepared remarks. \u201cLibra, and indeed any stablecoin project with global scale and scope, must address a core set of legal and regulatory challenges before it can facilitate a first payment.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers worldwide have continued to express skepticism over Facebook\u2019s efforts to build a global digital currency by 2020. That project has been called into doubt of late, as several high-profile companies dropped out of efforts to help establish the currency.\n\nDavid Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the currency project, remained confident on Wednesday that the project will attract more backers as regulatory concerns are addressed.\n\nBut Brainard said Libra backers have yet to address several major regulatory questions, including how they would ensure the currency is not used for illegal activities across borders. It also is unclear what protections or recourse consumers using the currency would have.\n\n\u201cConsumers need to be cautioned that stablecoins are likely to be starkly different from sovereign-issued currency in legal terms,\u201d she said.\n\nBrainard also said stablecoins like Libra could pose financial stability risks, as they could be subject to runs if not managed effectively.", "description": "U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said on Wednesday that Facebook's efforts to launch a Libra cryptocurrency must overcome a \"core set of legal and regulatory challenges\" before facilitating a single payment.", "authors": ["Pete Schroeder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441581283&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1S6-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
