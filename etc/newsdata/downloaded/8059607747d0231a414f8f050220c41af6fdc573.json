North Carolina's constitution, for instance, has a free elections clause, which has no counterpart in the U.S. constitution.\n\nGovernment reformers have already voiced their intent to file more cases in state courts.\n\nLast year, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued a similar ruling, tossing the state's U.S. congressional map and commissioning an independent expert to redraw the lines. The new map was credited with helping Democrats split the state's 18 congressional seats in 2018 after years of Republican dominance.\n\nTuesday's ruling concerned only the state legislative districts, but legal experts have said it could open the door to a similar lawsuit challenging North Carolina's congressional map, which is also widely seen as gerrymandered.\n\n\"This is a historic victory for the people of North Carolina,\" said Bob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, the government reform group that brought the lawsuit.\n\nMeanwhile, the new state legislative map will likely improve Democrats' chances of breaking the Republican majority in the state capitol.\n\nThe party that controls the state legislature following next year's election will be in charge of drawing new congressional and state legislative maps after the U.S. Census is complete.\n\n\"We look forward to taking back control of the General Assembly using fair maps next November,\" the state Democratic chairman, Wayne Goodwin, said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Ax; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Bill Berkrot)", "description": "A three-judge panel in Wake County Superior Court said the state Senate and state House district lines discriminated against Democratic voters in violation of the state constitution's free elections, equal protection and free speech clauses.
