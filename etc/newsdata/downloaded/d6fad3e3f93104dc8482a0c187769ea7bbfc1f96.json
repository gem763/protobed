The first men who went to space, they agreed to strap themselves to a bomb \u2026 they're all so brilliant, scientists and pilots and engineers, but they also were daredevils.'\n\nThe Jerusalem, Israel-born actress said that when her character, Lucy Cola, 'does something that's kind of daredevil ... she's reprimanded for it as being reckless.\n\n'So you see that \u2026 the same qualities that might be celebrated in one might be put down in another gender,' Portman said. 'So she is losing it, it but it's also kind of a normal reaction to lose it when you're facing injustice.'\n\nConclusion: Portman said that 'the same qualities that might be celebrated in one might be put down in another gender'\n\n'She is justifiably incensed at how she's been treated and you can see it's different [for women,]' Portman said of her character.\n\nThe mom-of-two - to son Aleph, eight, and daughter Amalia, two, with husband Benjamin Millepied, 42 - added that Hawley had her watch the 1983 historical film The Right Stuff to get a sense of the cocky, competitive culture between astronauts.\n\n'It's so charming among the guys, and you see it between the women and it kind of seems catty,' said Portman, who noted that the exact same gender imbalance is in play.\n\nLucy in the Sky debuts in theaters Friday.\n\nGroup outing: Portman appeared alongside co-star Jon Hamm and director Noah Hawley (R)\n\nImbalance: Portman said of her character, 'She is justifiably incensed at how she's been treated'", "description": "Natalie's character in the movie is loosely inspired by the story of astronaut Lisa Nowak, who made national headlines after a thwarted kidnapping attempt.", "authors": ["Adam S.
