Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), as if evidence has already established illegality and efforts to hide it.\n\nTrouble is, the Dems base their conclusions on allegations from an anonymous whistleblower recounting gossip, plus their reading of the Trump-Zelensky transcript.\n\nYet Trump mentions Biden only once, toward the end of the call, and makes no threats or promises. As for the allegations: The whistleblower (a CIA officer, reports The New York Times) says some officials told him Trump \u201cpressured\u201d Zelensky, and that some officials told him that other officials told them about the supposed coverup. Who his sources are, what they base their charges on and whether any of it is true is far from clear.\n\nMaguire had to stress that point repeatedly in his answers: \u201cRight now, all we have is an allegation \u2026 with second-hand information from a whistleblower,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no knowledge\u201d if it\u2019s \u201ctrue and accurate.\u201d\n\nContrast Dems\u2019 rush to judgment with the White House\u2019s actions: Rather than delay, it quickly OKed the release of the transcript and the whistleblower complaint.\n\nDems\u2019 attacks on Maguire were despicable. Taking office as the complaint landed, he has worked hand-in-hand with the inspector general of the intelligence community to get Congress all the info the law allows. Simply notifying Rep. Adam Schiff of the complaint\u2019s existence ensured everything would come out. Yet Schiff and other Dems still treated Maguire as part of the \u201ccoverup.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are showing their contempt not just for Trump, but for any facts that might get in their way.", "description": "Dems are basing their Ukraine scandal conclusions on allegations from an anonymous whistleblower recounting gossip, plus their reading of the Trump-Zelensky transcript \u2014 and they're letting their contempt not just for the president but the facts show.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ukraine-joseph-maguire.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
