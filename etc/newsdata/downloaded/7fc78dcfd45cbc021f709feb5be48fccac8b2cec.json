The 37-year-old remained perfect against all opponents other than Alvarez, whom Golovkin also drew with in a September 2017 bout for the same belt.\n\nJudge Frank Lombardi scored Saturday's fight 114-113, while Eric Marlinski and Kevin Morgan both scored it 115-112. The close result proved to be a surprise after Golovkin opened with a fury, dropping Derevyanchenko in the first round with a hard right and opening up a cut by his opponent's right eye with a left in the second round.\n\nBut the Ukrainian Derevyanchenko, known as \"The Technician,\" came back strong, taking Rounds 3-6 on two of the three judges' cards. Both fighters had strong moments down the stretch, with no unanimous scores given between Rounds 8-11, but Golovkin claimed the final round on all three cards.\n\n\"I told you, he's a very tough guy. This is huge experience for me,\" Golovkin said afterward. \"Right now, I understand I need more. ... I feel this was not an easy fight for me. This was a tough fight.\"\n\nDerevyanchenko, 33, fell to 13-2 (10 KOs) in his career. His only previous loss came via split decision to Daniel Jacobs in an October 2018 fight for the same title.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Gennadiy Golovkin survived a heated back-and-forth bout with a victory via  unanimous decision over Sergiy Derevyanchenko on Saturday night at Madison ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
