(AP) \u2014 Matt Moore spent his spring as a scouting assistant with the Miami Dolphins, and he spent most of the summer gearing up for a season as an assistant high school football coach.\n\nHe\u2019ll be spending his fall trying to keep the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl hunt.\n\nThe journeyman quarterback, who was signed on the eve of the regular season following an injury to backup Chiefs quarterback Chad Henne, has been thrust into the starting role after reigning league MVP Patrick Mahomes dislocated his kneecap in Thursday night\u2019s victory over the Broncos.\n\nThe injury happened as Mahomes was sneaking for a first down in the second quarter, and Moore played the rest of the way \u2014 his first meaningful snaps in two years \u2014 in an eventual 30-6 rout.\n\n\u201cYou saw production from him for a number of years. He was in those situations where people would debate he should be the starter or the other guy should be the starter, wherever he as,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cYou saw that ability to start football games and win.\u201d\n\nNow, his responsibility will be to keep the Chiefs (5-2) on the right track until Mahomes is able to return. An MRI taken Friday revealed no major damage to the ligaments in his right knee, and the team is hopeful that Mahomes could return in four to six weeks \u2014 roughly the amount of time until its bye.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an inspirational guy,\u201d Moore said, when asked whether Mahomes said anything in the post-game locker room. \u201cHe said a bunch of stuff about the team win, gave a bunch of props to the defense. The defense played outstanding. Just kind of brought us together and broke us down.\u201d\n\nThe Chiefs actually came close to signing Moore before last season.\n\nThey were in search of a veteran backup for Mahomes, who was heading into his first season as the starter, and were wavering between Moore and Henne. They wound up selecting the latter, but Henne broke his ankle during a preseason game and the Chiefs decided to give Moore a chance.\n\nHe quickly picked up the intricate Kansas City offense over the first six weeks of the season, and he was good enough to keep the Broncos guessing the rest of the way Thursday night.\n\nMoore wound up completing 10 passes for 117 yards with a 57-yard scoring strike to Tyreek Hill.\n\nMost importantly, he didn\u2019t throw a pick or make any big mistakes.\n\n\u201cI was devastated for (Mahomes), obviously. He\u2019s been down and popped up pretty quick,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThis one obviously wasn\u2019t that case. So I just hope he\u2019s OK. At the same time, we have to go and win a football game, and I\u2019ve been in this position before and you just kind of move forward.\u201d\n\nMoore went 15-15 in 30 starts with the Panthers and Dolphins, and he appeared in 51 games in all over the course of 10 seasons with them. Adds his totals from Thursday night and he\u2019s thrown for more than 7,000 yards with 46 touchdown passes and 36 interceptions.\n\nAlong with experience, he also appears to have the support of a locker room full of star players who expect nothing short of a championship. Hill is back from an earlier collarbone injury, and Kansas City could get more offensive reinforcements back soon \u2014 wide receiver Sammy Watkins (hamstring), left tackle Eric Fisher (groin) and left guard Andrew Wylie (ankle) are making progress.\n\n\u201cWith Pat out everybody has to step up to a whole other level. When the MVP goes down everybody has to step up,\u201d wide receiver Mecole Hardman said. \u201cWe did that. Matt came in and did a great job. I think the O-line picked it up a bit. It\u2019s the next man up.\u201d\n\nThe Chiefs also have a little extra time for Moore to get settled. They played the Broncos on Thursday night, and their next game doesn\u2019t come until they face the Packers a week from Sunday.\n\n\u201cMatt has been in the league for a long time. We have trust in him,\u201d Hardman said. \u201cWe just had to go out there and play and keep everything the same. We can\u2019t dwell on it and get down.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "KANSAS CITY, Mo.
