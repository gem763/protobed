A spinning top doji formed below the 50% retracement level and yesterday\u2019s bearish close suggest momentum is starting to turn lower once more. While the ratio remains below the resistance zone, we expect silver to outperform gold over the near-term (even if both underlying markets break lower as part of a correction).\n\nGiven the reversal of risk sentiment, the current environment is less supportive of silver and gold. We\u2019re therefore looking at a bearish ratio over the near-term setup only. Further out, we expect the demand for gold and silver to return.\n\nGold/USD Daily Chart\n\nWe\u2019ve been noting for several weeks in the weekly COT report that gold has been screaming over-extension to the upside. While new highs are certainly possible (given the strength of its breakout to multi-year highs) a correction almost feels overdue. So, it\u2019s interesting to note that gold sits on a pivotal level of support.\n\nGold prices remain in a bullish channel on the daily chart, although its retracement is testing its lower bounds of the channel, the 50% retracement level and a zone of support between $1480-88. There\u2019s also the bearish divergence with RSI to consider, which shows bullish momentum is waning within the channel.\n\nGiven the strength of the decline from $1557, a clear break of the channel and $1480 could suggest that a deeper correction is underway.\n\nHowever, given the levels of support nearby, a minor bounce could materialize and form a lower high, ahead of breaking below $1480.\n\nIf we see bullish momentum return from current levels, we can reconsider the potential for it to re-test (or even break above) recent highs.\n\nSilver/USD Daily Chart\n\nThe daily structure for silver appears the more bullish over the near-term than gold. While we\u2019ve clearly seen a deep retracement, a Rikshaw Man doji has formed at the bullish trendline and the 61.8% Fibonacci level. There\u2019s also no bearish divergence with RSI like that seen on gold. Granted, RSI has broken down through it\u2019s own channel, but there are more levels of support nearby to cushion a fall from a technical standpoint.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by City Index (Matt Simpson) covering: XAU/USD, XAG/USD, Gold Futures, Silver Futures.
