Take a class in the morning, shower, grab your oat milk lattes or smoothies and crack on with the day\u2019s tasks with no minutes lost.\n\nFrame and Another Space are both implementing ways they can cater to all needs, with the use of cafes and chill-out zones, which are enjoyable spaces for those to hang out after their workouts.\n\nMORE: Jessica Ennis-Hill shares her top tips on how to keep exercising through Autumn\n\nMORE: Reebok launches maternity fitness range that grows with your bump\n\nMORE: The fitness industry is overwhelmingly white \u2013 and that needs to change\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "We take a look ahead to see which fitness classes everyone is going to be going wild for next year.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PRI_867889471_1569482905.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
