Buttigieg, however, went a step further and turned the moral crisis into a religious crisis.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk in language,\u201d he began, \u201cthat is understood across the heartland, about faith. You know, if you believe that God is watching as poison is being belched into the air of creation, and people are being harmed by it, countries put at risk in low-lying areas, what do you suppose God thinks of that?\u201d His answer: God would call it \u201ca sin.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be religious,\u201d he added, \u201cto see the moral dimension of this because, frankly, every religion and nonreligious moral tradition tells us that we have some responsibility to stewardship, some responsibility for taking care of what\u2019s around us, not to mention taking care of our neighbor.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nButtigieg has already been mentioned in Washington as a possible vice-presidential choice, in which case \u2014 as America\u2019s first gay presidential candidate \u2014 he would face his fellow evangelical Christian Indianan, Mike Pence, in what might prove a historic debate, a debate that could force to the surface a neglected religious dimension to the climate crisis. Will Buttigieg strike the same note at the upcoming, more wide-open debate on Thursday in the very \u201cheartland\u201d he speaks of \u2014 in Texas, a state alive both with evangelical Christianity and with climate crisis denial?\n\nAmericans dream of the larger-than-life political leader who can inspire us to rise above ourselves and do what we must do to save our planet and ourselves. But before that inspiring leader can appear, inspiration must first reach the voters who will elect such a leader. And how can that happen?\n\nIs it too much to hope, as Buttigieg seems to, that American religious leaders \u2014 Christian priests and ministers, Jewish rabbis, Muslim imams, Hindu pundits, and others \u2014 may speak to their people of the moral obligation implicit in the fact that in the United States each year 194,000 lives are claimed by inhalation of air pollutants from fossil fuels, not to speak of all the deaths resulting from weather extremes triggered by climate disruption? Might they not suggest that it is morally wrong to ask Americans to pay with their lives for our collective addiction to fossil fuels? What does it profit a nation to save the trillion dollars per year that a full conversion to renewables might cost but to lose the nation\u2019s soul \u2014 and all those innocent lives \u2014 in the process? Week in and week out, can our religious leade\n\nPete Buttigieg: 'Nominate me and you get to see the president stand next to an American war veteran and explain why he chose to pretend to be disabled when it was his chance to serve'rs ask that kind of question?\n\nVoters do not like to be preached at. But there is a place for preaching \u2014 a crucial place\u2014 and who can step into that breach if not the clergy of the country? Evolution has conditioned us to respond to danger mainly when it is near in time and place and threatens our loved ones or ourselves, but religion itself is a product of evolution and has survived partly because it delivers a crucial corrective to just such potentially fatal myopia. Nothing could be less scientific than to ignore its relevance at a crisis moment like the present, and there are visionary scientists such as V Ram Ramanathan, Frieman Presidential Chair in Climate Sustainability at the University of California, San Diego, who recognize as much.\n\nRamanathan has led the way as a consultant to the Vatican in the preparation of Pope Francis\u2019s climate encyclical Laudato Si\u2019 and in the far-reaching UC project Bending the Curve: Climate Solutions. And thanks to leadership like his, there are more religious leaders all the time who have embraced the climate facts as science knows them, definitely including evangelical Christian leaders like those who produced the eloquent manifesto \u201cChristians and Climate Change: An Evangelical Call to Action.\u201d\n\nBut the prophetic message, if it can be delivered soon enough and forcefully enough to awaken the country, will not be delivered by the few clergy who make headlines. Instead, it will be delivered by the thousands who do not, and for them a few kindling political lines in the self-sacrificial vein of John F Kennedy\u2019s \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country\u201d may yet make the crucial difference.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

When the climate catastrophe that threatens us all is finally recognized as presenting the greatest moral challenge that humankind has ever faced, then the cry of conscience from below may reach the top at last, and the world\u2019s now paralyzed political leadership may arise and walk.
