McCabe\u2019s ex-boss, however \u2014 former FBI Director James Comey \u2014 has said he could be a witness against him, based on testimony Comey gave to an internal watchdog that appeared to contradict McCabe\u2019s version of events.\n\nMcCabe was fired in 2018 after the Justice Department's inspector general concluded that the FBI\u2019s No. 2 had exhibited a \u201clack of candor\u201d during its probe into disclosures to the media about the bureau\u2019s investigation into the Clinton Foundation. McCabe has argued that he did not intend to mislead investigators and argued in a lawsuit filed in August that his ouster was politically motivated retaliation \u2014 directed by President Donald Trump \u2014 meant to punish him for his role in the probe of the Trump campaign\u2019s links to Russia.\n\nStill, prosecutors have recommended that McCabe face indictment over his actions during the IG probe.\n\nIf McCabe ultimately does face charges, he\u2019ll have the backing of several top national officials who have now left government, including Mary McCord, a career DOJ attorney who oversaw the government\u2019s Russia probe as acting head of the DOJ\u2019s National Security Division, and David Cohen, the No. 2 at the CIA from 2015 to 2017.\n\nLisa Monaco, an Obama-era homeland security adviser, and Denis McDonough, a former Obama chief of staff, also agreed to testify.\n\nMcCabe's lawyers said the testimony of these witnesses won't be limited \"solely to character evidence\" \u2014 they'll also serve \"as fact witnesses, to testify about the many critical and highly sensitive national security and law enforcement they worked on with Mr. McCabe.\"\n\nAnother list indicating other Obama-era officials had also agreed to testify was provided in error.\n\n\"The legal analysis provided to Politico last week indicated that Mr. McCabe has obtained commitments from more than a dozen former high-ranking government officials who worked closely with Mr. McCabe on law enforcement and national security matters to testify as character witnesses on Mr. McCabe\u2019s behalf,\" said a spokesman for McCabe. \"An errant version included some individuals who have not committed to serve as character witnesses at trial. We requested that Politico remove those names.\"\n\nMcCabe's legal team previously asked DOJ to overrule the prosecutors\u2019 indictment recommendation, but were rebuffed, according to a person familiar with the matter. The lawyers wrote an 11-page legal analysis, entitled \u201cReasons Not To Prosecute Andrew McCabe,\u201d as part of their effort to convince DOJ not to bring charges.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear, however, whether the grand jury convened in McCabe\u2019s case has actually returned an indictment. McCabe\u2019s lawyer Michael Bromwich sent a letter last Thursday to U.S. Attorney Jesse Liu \u2014 whose Washington, D.C., office has been handling the case \u2014 asking about \u201crumors\u201d that the jurors had declined to prosecute McCabe over the alleged media leak.\n\nBromwich argued that if that were the case, \u201cthe justice manual compels you not to resubmit the case to the same or a different grand jury.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also still unclear what specific charges prosecutors have recommended be brought against McCabe.\n\nMcCabe \u2014 who launched a counterintelligence investigation into Trump after he fired Comey in 2017 \u2014 said in an interview earlier this year that he believed his firing was \u201ca perfect way to undermine my ability to, who knows, provide testimony against\u201d the president. He also insisted that he \u201cnever, ever intentionally misled the FBI inspection division, the office of the inspector general, or any director of the FBI, ever.\u201d\n\nCLARIFICATION: This article has been updated to reflect additional information from McCabe's legal team about the list of character witnesses.", "description": "Obama-era national security leaders would testify on behalf of McCabe should he face trial over allegations that he misled officials about leaks to the media.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand", "Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
