Police officers have been left baffled by the case as they have been unable to find any trace of the missing teenager.\n\nIn a tearful interview on This Morning, Leah's parents Claire and John said they do not believe she vanished deliberately and think she may have been murdered.\n\nClaire said: \"If the worst has happened, I would like my daughter's body back so her family can have a burial and we can say goodbye - because everybody deserves that.\"\n\nJohn added: \"Truthfully, I do not believe she has run away. She has got a fair amount of money in the bank and that has not been touched. If you are running away, surely you would take something?\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nThe devastated parents said the family has all but given up hope that Leah will be found safe.\n\nLeah was last captured on CCTV walking to work on February 15. The night before she had returned home from work and changed into jogging bottoms. She told her parents she was popping out to see a friend for a \"catch up\", but she never turned up at her friend's house.\n\nClaire added: \"There is no way she has run away. Someone has taken her, something bad has happened... there are some people out there in the world who know where she is and what has happened to her.\"\n\nThe family described how Leah came across as younger than she was and disliked partying with her friends, preferring to stay at home and read her Harry Potter and Twilight vampire books.\n\nHer mum also spoke publicly for the first time about her daughter's relationship with an older man - a 27-year-old who Leah's protective brother Haydon has accused of \"grooming\" her.\n\nClaire said: \"We were not aware of a relationship before she went missing. We've found out since that she was seeing somebody but that person has been spoken to.\"\n\nPolice have previously confirmed there was no reason to suspect the man.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHowever, the head of the police investigation, Detective Sergeant Andy Howard, told This Morning: \"There were in Leah's life some anxieties and some things that were concerning her, worrying her. Whether these anxieties were any different from what many teenagers go through at that stage, is difficult to say.\"\n\nSpeaking on This Morning, investigative journalist and former police officer Mark Williams-Thomas said Leah's case was \"very unusual\".\n\nHe visited Leah's family home in Emerson Valley, Milton Keynes, and spoke to Detective Sergeant Howard.\n\nMark said: \"The police have been baffled. People do not just vanish. I am going to try and piece together what has happened to Leah.\"\n\nHe is now convinced the vital clue lies in what Leah did the evening before she seemingly vanished into thin air while walking to work along Milton Keynes roads and footpaths on the morning of February 15\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: south bedsnews agency_sbna_fairl)\n\nMark appealed for information about where Leah went on Valentine's night between leaving home at 6pm and returning at 7.15pm.\n\n\"If we get the answer to that, it will solve this case,\" he said.\n\n\"That night, Leah was wearing a very distinctive long-sleeved top with the words 'I solemnly swear I am up to no good' on the front. We are asking you to study the photos of an identical top, along with the joggers, to see if it triggers a memory.\"\n\nDet. Sgt. Howard said: \"I find it hard to believe there is somebody out there who doesn't know what is going on with Leah - somebody she had at least confided in about some concerns she might have had or what potential plan, or what her movements were.\"\n\nThe search has also been brought to the attention of tens of thousands of football fans, after Chelsea FC included an appeal for information about Leah, who was a Chelsea fan and regularly visited Stamford Bridge to watch them play, in the match day programme for Chelsea vs Grimsby last week.\n\nThere was a \u00a35,000 reward available to anyone who called 101 with information which could help lead to Leah's discovery.", "description": "The case of Leah Croucher has \"baffled\" police who have been unable to find any trace of the teenager or what happened to her since she was last seen in Milton Keynes, Bucks, seven months ago", "authors": ["Grace Witherden", "Image", "Pa", "Swns", "South Bedsnews Agency_Sbna_Fairl"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20467151.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Leah-Croucher-missing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
