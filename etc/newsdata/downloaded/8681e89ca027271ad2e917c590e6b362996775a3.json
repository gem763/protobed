Sentences chosen to show usage of the word woman include: \u201cMs September will embody the professional, intelligent yet sexy career woman\u201d and \u201cI told you to be home when I get home, little woman\u201d. Such sentences depict \u201cwomen as sex objects, subordinate, and/or an irritation to men\u201d, the petition says.\n\nSignatories are calling on OUP to \u201celiminate all phrases and definitions that discriminate against and patronise women and/or connote men\u2019s ownership of women\u201d, to \u201cenlarge the dictionary\u2019s entry for \u2018woman\u2019\u201d, and to \u201cinclude examples representative of minorities, for example, a transgender woman, a lesbian woman, etc\u201d.\n\nIn response, OUP\u2019s head of lexical content strategy Katherine Connor Martin has said that editors are investigating \u201cwhether there are senses of woman which are not currently covered but should be added in a future update\u201d.\n\nPointing out that the content referred to in the petition is not from the scholarly Oxford English Dictionary, but from the Oxford Thesaurus of English and the Oxford Dictionary of English, which are drawn from \u201creal-life use\u201d of language, Martin said: \u201cIf there is evidence of an offensive or derogatory word or meaning being widely used in English, it will not be excluded from the dictionary solely on the grounds that it is offensive or derogatory.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonetheless, part of the descriptive process is to make a word\u2019s offensive status clear in the dictionary\u2019s treatment. For instance, the phrase the little woman is defined as \u2018a condescending way of referring to one\u2019s wife\u2019, and the use of \u2018bit\u2019 as a synonym for woman is labelled as \u2018derogatory\u2019 in the thesaurus,\u201d said Martin. \u201cSensibilities regarding language are constantly changing, and our editorial team is always grateful for feedback to ensure that the status of offensive or denigrating terms is clear to our readers.\u201d\n\nThe petitioners also criticise the fact that \u201cthe definition of a \u2018man\u2019 is much more exhaustive than that of a \u2018woman\u2019 \u2013 with 25 examples for men, compared to only five for women\u201d. But OUP said that as its dictionary is based on \u201cevidence of actual usage, entries for two different words will only be perfectly parallel if the words are genuinely used in a perfectly parallel way\u201d.\n\nAt present, OUP said, the words man and woman are not used in identical ways. \u201cFor instance, sense four of \u2018man\u2019 is \u2018a figure or token used in playing a board game\u2019, but that meaning is not evidenced for woman,\u201d said Martin. \u201cStatistical analysis of large digital text databases shows that there are significant differences in how the words man and woman are used. People speak of a \u2018man about town\u2019 but rarely of a \u2018woman about town\u2019; of a \u2018ladies\u2019 man\u2019 but not a \u2018gentlemen\u2019s lady\u2019; of \u2018womanly\u2019 curves and wiles, but \u2018manly\u2019 handshakes and jawlines.\u201d\n\nMartin said that as the usage of English speakers changes over time, the dictionary would change to reflect the new lexical terrain. \u201cThe current cultural moment has seen an increasing acknowledgment of the real-life impact that words can have on individuals and groups. As this awareness leads to changes in linguistic behaviour, the dictionary will seek to record them,\u201d she said.\n\nThe OUP added that dictionary staff \u201care taking the points raised in the petition very seriously \u2026 As ever, our dictionaries strive to reflect, rather than dictate, language so any changes will be made on that basis.\u201d", "description": "Nearly 30,000 people have signed petition calling on the publisher to cut entries that \u2018discriminate against and patronise women\u2019", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0f3eff49a8ddb1ea3e2348480f45667060f6390/0_180_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d32ed5b58cac110f13a07fa05a948872", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
