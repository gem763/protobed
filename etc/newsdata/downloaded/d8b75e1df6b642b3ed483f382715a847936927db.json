The response appears to be positive \u2014 with the caveat that courts may strike down such efforts, according to the Observer.\n\nAug 28: Johnson officially asks Queen Elizabeth II to prorogue Parliament; the queen approves\n\nThe government maintains that the move is routine. But there is an immediate and strong backlash to that claim.\n\nJohn Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, suggests that Johnson\u2019s moves are unconstitutional. While doing so may be customary for most new prime ministers, requesting prorogation just ahead of the scheduled Brexit date makes it \u201cblindingly obvious that the purpose of [suspending Parliament] now would be to stop [MPs] debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country,\u201d Bercow said.\n\nThe showdown\n\nSept. 3: Members of Parliament seize control over agenda\n\nAmid early signs that Johnson may have overstretched the goodwill of lawmakers, 21 Conservative Party members join a rebel alliance to take control of the House of Commons.\n\nSept. 3 and 4: Defections and ejections, as Parliament members back a \u201cno no-deal\u201d Brexit law\n\nThe same day, Johnson loses his parliamentary majority, as one Conservative Party member, Phillip Lee, defects to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe following day, a majority of Parliament members back a bill designed to prevent a no-deal scenario. In effect, it forces Johnson to request a Brexit extension, if he fails to agree on a deal with the European Union. Previously, Johnson had vowed that Britain would leave the E.U. on Oct. 31 \u2014 with or without a deal.\n\nTwenty-one Conservative Parliament members who back the bill are expelled from the parliamentary party \u2014 setting up a further showdown between Conservative moderates and hard-line Brexiteers around Johnson. Among the Tory rebels is Nicholas Soames, the grandson of former prime minister Winston Churchill.\n\nParliament members also reject a call by Johnson for a snap election ahead of Oct. 31, which could have provided Johnson with an opportunity to regain a parliamentary majority. Opposition lawmakers fear that Johnson could exploit such a vote to push through a no-deal Brexit after all.\n\nSept. 6: High Court of England and Wales rejects legal challenge against suspension of Parliament\n\nSept. 9 and Sept. 10: Parliament rejects Boris Johnson\u2019s call for an early election a second time; Parliament is suspended\n\nIn its final hours before being suspended for what many at this point expect will be five weeks, Parliament\u2019s second rejection of a snap election squashes Johnson\u2019s hopes for a vote ahead of Oct. 31.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers raise alarm over concerns that Johnson may ignore their Brexit legislation.\n\n\u201cJohnson himself has refused to say he will comply,\u201d according to my colleagues Griff Witte, Karla Adam and Amanda Ferguson. \u201cThere is no modern precedent for a British leader willfully ignoring an act of Parliament. To do so would risk being held in contempt of court \u2014 and put in jail.\u201d\n\nAs Parliament is suspended, opposition lawmakers shout \u201cShame!\u201d and attempt to stop Bercow from leaving the House chamber.\n\nSept. 11: Scottish court rules that Johnson\u2019s suspension of Parliament is unlawful\n\nThough without immediate implications, the ruling is a first indication that the prime minister might be in legally troubled waters. In a particularly worrisome development for Johnson, the three-judge panel finds that he may have misled the queen about why a suspension of Parliament was required at this exact point in time and for the requested length.\n\nSept. 17: Supreme Court hearing commences\n\nIn a sign of the case\u2019s high stakes, the Supreme Court increases the number of judges on the panel from the normal five or seven to 11 \u2014 the maximum number possible.\n\nSept. 19: Former prime minister John Major speaks out\n\nOn the final day of the hearing, former Conservative Party prime minister John Major warns that it would be a \u201cremarkable position\u201d if the court concluded that a prime minister faces no legal restrictions when suspending Parliament. The comment pits him \u2014 a Brexit critic \u2014 against Johnson, despite both politicians\u2019 affiliation with the Conservative Party.\n\nSept. 24: U.K. Supreme Court rules that suspension of Parliament was \u201cunlawful, void and of no effect\u201d\n\nThe unexpectedly straightforward and unanimous ruling is being celebrated by Johnson\u2019s opponents as a victory for parliamentary powers in Britain. The government vows to adhere to the ruling, as some begin to demand Johnson\u2019s resignation.\n\nThough the judges do not explicitly state it, their ruling suggests that the Supreme Court agrees with the Scottish judges who previously asserted that Johnson may have misled the queen.\n\nRead more:\n\nBritain\u2019s Supreme Court rules Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended Parliament illegally", "description": "The British Supreme Court delivered the most stinging rebuke to date to Johnson and his advisers on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/q1VqOPRQ0yQR8IoVjiRLrgm-hYo=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-24-2019/t_b1d2d58493b54fecb504748079044337_name_1920_britain_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
