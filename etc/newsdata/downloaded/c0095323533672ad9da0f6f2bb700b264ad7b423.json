The arena has been home to Wing Bowl, Gritty, indoor football, a Royal Rumble and a Republican national convention.\n\nHockey sticks sit in a barrel, right, in the \"Rage Room\" before the Flyers' home opener against the Devils.

The franchise that once satiated fans with the bloodlust of the Broad Street Bullies during the glory years of their 1974 and 1975 Stanley Cup championships has gone from \"The Hammer\" to sledgehammers to let fans take their whacks inside a dorm-sized room.\n\n\"The concept is definitely one-of-a-kind and non-traditional,\" Flyers executive Valerie Camillo said. \"We ran the concept by some of our fans who told us they thought this would be a fresh way to have some harmless fun.\"\n\nThe Flyers charge $35 per person or $60 for two for five-minute rage sessions and will let up to 14 fans per game try their best at high-sticking. There are both online reservations and walk-up slots available. There are no current plans to open the room for 76ers games or other events. The room is accessible through a \"bookcase\" straight out of Wayne Manor and, like Batman, fans change into their rage room costume of jumpsuit and safety helmet.\n\nThe first Flyers fan to give it a shot was Peter Caccioppoli, of New York. He swung a hockey stick at a place setting that would make Martha Stewart wince and later took aim on a fishbowl which had the \"NJ\" Devils logo.\n\nCaccioppoli said he has been a partial season ticket holder \"for a very frustrating five years,\" and was thrilled to take part in the demolition derby.\n\n\"I broke the stick, which was a lot of fun,\" Caccioppoli said. \"The bat is easy to wield. I played baseball for a long time, so it was easy to throw a couple of plates and smash those. The sledgehammer was fun, too. It was a good time.\"\n\nThe Flyers introduced their googly-eyed mascot Gritty last season and the Comcast Spectacor ownership group has about turned the arena into a sports book this season with betting lines bombarding the new big screen for the opener. The Flyers struggled to draw consistent packed crowds last season as they missed the playoffs for the fourth time in seven seasons. They haven't made it to the second round since 2012 and will hit 10 years this season since their last Stanley Cup Final appearance.\n\nThe Eagles once sent rowdy fans to a small jail inside since-demolished Veterans Stadium as a way to curb boorish behavior . Now, the Flyers want you to come up and face off for fun against the glass \u2014 a reason to go wild as the home team tries to break a championship drought.", "description": "The Philadelphia Flyers charge $35 per person or $60 for two for five-minute 'Rage Room' sessions and up to 14 fans per game can smash objects.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Published P.M.
