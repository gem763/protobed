Another 20,000 or more supporters were unable to get into the arena. The event was pure Trump as he excoriated Joe Biden and his son Hunter as well as the impeachment inquiry which is the latest Deep State and Democratic Party scheme to overthrow the 2016 election results.\n\nRegarding Joe Biden, the President said he \u201cwas never considered smart. He was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass!\u201d He also wondered \u201cwhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d\n\nAs the crowd roared their approval, the President blamed the media for reporting the claims against Joe and Hunter Biden were \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d As he pointed to the media, the President said, \u201cit\u2019s not unsubstantiated, you crooked son of a guns, it\u2019s 100% true.\u201d\n\nOnce again, the President scored a home run at the wild rally. It indicated his desire to target states that Hillary Clinton won in 2020. In recent months, he has been holding rallies in \u201cblue\u201d states such as Minnesota, New Mexico, and New Hampshire. Last year, he also held a rally in Nevada, which is another state he believes he can win in 2020.\n\nDemocrats know that the President can attract record crowds at whatever state he visits, even if it is one that Hillary Clinton carried in 2020. Therefore, they work overtime to create roadblocks for the rallies.\n\nPrior to his speech Thursday night, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey demanded the Trump campaign pay $530,000 for extra police presence, street closures and barricades. Obviously, the Trump campaign balked at the clear \u201cextortion\u201d and prepared to file a lawsuit. It was eventually resolved when the Target Center agreed to hold the contracted event despite receiving no payment from the Trump campaign.\n\nWhile Minneapolis leaders tried to extract over a half a million dollars from President Trump\u2019s campaign, it was a much different bill for a \u201chealthcare\u201d rally featuring then President Barack Obama in 2009. The event was also held at the Target Center, but the tally for extra security was a measly $20,000, less than 5% of what was charged for this event.\n\nDespite the dispute over payment, Minneapolis police promised a \u201chighly visible and robust\u201d police presence for the President\u2019s rally. Unfortunately, for Trump supporters leaving the rally, police protection was seriously lacking outside the arena.\n\nAfter the speech, hundreds of enraged left-wing protesters attacked Trump supporters. One rally attendee was hit by a pile of garbage and slapped in the face. Over three dozen \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats were stolen and set ablaze in an eerie street bonfire. Among the ashes were vicious Trump hating signs.\n\nOther members of the leftist mob overturned barricades, while some chased Trump supporters and even harassed innocent bystanders. One local resident, Kali Finch, did not attend the rally, but was in the wrong place at the wrong time. She was trying to move through the area with her brother but was \u201cshoved\u201d and called a \u201cracist\u201d by numerous members of the left-wing mob.\n\nIronically, liberal Democrat Mayor Jacob Frey proclaimed that Thursday would be \u201cLove Trumps Hate Day.\u201d However, for the street thugs, there was no \u201clove,\u201d only \u201chate\u201d toward the President and his supporters.\n\nThis type of chaos has been seen around the country after Trump rallies and at numerous Antifa marches. The perpetrators of the violence are almost always left-wing agitators, not Trump supporters. Most are young, white liberals who are brimming with hate, undoubtedly fueled by indoctrination at colleges and universities across the country. Too many of these institutions of higher learning do not welcome open debate or discussion and discriminate against conservative speakers and professors. Instead, students are exposed to a steady diet of progressive ideas taught by instructors that are almost universally liberal.\n\nMixed among the throng of anti-Trump protesters in Minneapolis were rabid communists. In fact, one protester was emboldened enough to wave the flag of the People\u2019s Republic of China. It was reprehensible for this anti-Trump maniac to show such support for the communist Chinese. Currently, the government is repressing and brutalizing the courageous demonstrators in Hong Kong, who are fighting for freedom and singing our National Anthem.\n\nAs the flag of communist China was being paraded around the streets of Minneapolis by Antifa thugs, Trump supporters were waving American flags inside the Target Center. This contrast is indicative of what American voters will be facing in the 2020 election. It will be an election of contrasts: change agents vs. the swamp; socialism vs. capitalism; and pro-America vs. anti-America.\n\nIn the 2020 election, our nation\u2019s voters will have to decide what type of behavior to reward. If we elect as our next President a \u201cwoke\u201d progressive, who is supported by the type of anti-American Antifa thugs who protested outside the Target Center, our future will be bleak both economically and culturally.\n\nLet\u2019s hope that America rejects that type of radicalism and re-elects Donald Trump, a President who loves this country and understands why protesters halfway around the world are risking everything to wave our flag and sing our National Anthem.", "description": "On Thursday night, President Trump entertained 20,000 enthusiastic supporters in .10/12/2019 2:47:51AM EST.", "authors": ["Jeff Crouere", "Timothy Meads", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/283/807baa68-fabd-4bc0-9952-5cc3f569b468.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
