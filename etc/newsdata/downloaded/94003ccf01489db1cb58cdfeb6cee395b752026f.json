It also said it would create a \u201csafe-country list\u201d for people who have illegally entered Greece, making it easier to send them back if they are not at risk at home.\n\nThe goal is for some 20,000 people to leave the squalid conditions in the islands' reception centers, Greek officials said. The center-right government also aims to deport some 10,000 people in 2020, compared with the approximately 1,800 people deported in total during the past four and a half years under the previous left-wing Syriza government.\n\nThe newly elected New Democracy party is grappling with a significant surge in migration flows that is exacerbating the poor conditions in reception centers in the Aegean that receive the bulk of migrants.\n\nGreece is once again the main point of entry for migrants coming to Europe, with new arrivals at their highest level since an agreement between the European Union and Turkey in March 2016 to reduce the flow.\n\nSome 23,000 people have landed on Greek shores in the last three months. This year so far, about 46,000 people have entered the country via its land and sea borders. The other two European frontline states, Spain and Italy, have jointly received a total of 29,000 migrants so far in 2019.\n\nThe situation in Greece could escalate even further if Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan makes good on his threat to reopen the borders if he doesn't receive adequate international support.\n\nOn Sunday, the charred corpse of a woman was recovered from the infamous Moria camp on Lesbos, after fires broke out. Her baby, along with 16 other people, were transferred to hospital. The unrest came a few days after a five-year-old Afghan boy was accidentally run over and killed by a truck on the fringes of the camp. A teenage boy was stabbed to death late August in a brawl.\n\n\u201cNo one can call the fire and these deaths an accident. This tragedy is the direct result of a brutal policy that is trapping 13,000 people in a camp made for 3,000,\u201d said Marco Sandrone, a field coordinator for the NGO Doctors Without Borders. He described the camp in question as \"hell.\"\n\nGreece said it plans to completely transform its asylum process in order to tighten up the time needed for a final decision. In the face of resistance from international organizations and opposition parties, the government has dropped plans to abolish second-instance committees, where asylum seekers can appeal if their application is rejected. However, the authorities will alter the composition of those committees.\n\nNew legislation also means that if applicants fail to cooperate, or fail to be physically present throughout the asylum process, they will be removed. The goal, officials said, is to have a final decision within three months, in a procedure that currently often takes more than two years. The new rules impose stricter definitions of which applicants are considered \"vulnerable\" \u2014 for example, applicants suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder will no longer qualify.", "description": "Government speeds up measures after deaths in crowded camps that NGOs describe as \u2018hell.\u2019", "authors": ["Nektaria Stamouli"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1172554761-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
