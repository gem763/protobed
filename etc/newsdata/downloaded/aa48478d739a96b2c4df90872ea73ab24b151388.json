It will also guarantee consensus among all parties. Such a solution is stipulated by article 102 of the constitution.\"", "description": "Bouteflika's own party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), joins the army's chief of staff and the National Rally for Democracy party's call for the ailing president to resign.", "authors": ["Chris Harris"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/74/90/48/1000x563_cmsv2_7456cd35-b8c7-5b25-b538-04e1f289568d-3749048.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-26"}
