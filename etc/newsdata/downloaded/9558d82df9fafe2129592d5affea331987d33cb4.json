The Federal Aviation Administration also investigated the business in 2016 after two people, including a non-certified instructor, died in a tandem sky-dive. The investigation ultimately found no violations, the Bee reported.\n\nAt least 21 people have died in accidents involving the Lodi Parachute Center since 1981, according to the Bee.
