According to MLB.com\u2019s David Adler, their comeback chances hovered around 25.7% for a series win, with a 7.8% chance of getting it done in six games and a 17.9% chance in seven. The club\u2019s playoff hopes boiled down to a single-game performance from Zack Greinke, who had followed up his All-Star campaign with several rough outings in the ALDS and ALCS.\n\nLuckily for the Astros, Greinke entered Friday\u2019s game with some of the best stuff the club has seen from him this postseason. He pitched 4 2/3 innings of one-run, three-walk, six-strikeout ball, holding the Nationals to a single run and paving the path to a 4-1 win \u2014 the Astros\u2019 first of the World Series.\n\nBehind Greinke, the Astros\u2019 offense consistently found opportunities to get around An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez. The Nats\u2019 right-hander took his second loss of the postseason and first since Game 3 of the NLDS, allowing 10 hits, four runs, a walk, and striking out just four of 27 batters in 5 1/3 innings. He allowed a double to Carlos Correa in the second inning, who was then driven in by Josh Reddick on a line drive to left field. In the third, Jos\u00e9 Altuve led off the inning with another double, then crossed home plate on a Michael Brantley RBI single after the ball deflected off of S\u00e1nchez.\n\nThe Nationals finally caught a break in the bottom of the fourth. With one out and Ryan Zimmerman on first, Victor Robles roped a triple off of Greinke, plating Zimmerman and getting the team on the board. It was the first and last run they\u2019d manage off of the Astros; after Greinke departed in the fifth, Houston rotated through an inexhaustible combination of Josh James, Brad Peacock, Will Harris, Joe Smith, and Roberto Osuna to stifle any rally the Nationals might have tried to engineer.\n\nThe Astros weren\u2019t quite done yet, however: Altuve and Brantley went back-to-back again to drive in a third run in the fifth inning. In the sixth, Robinson Chirinos hit a home run off of S\u00e1nchez, lifting a first-pitch sinker out to the left-field foul pole and padding the Astros\u2019 lead, 4-1.\n\nThe Nationals will attempt to get the series back on track on Saturday night, when they\u2019ll send southpaw Patrick Corbin out to the mound for his first start since Game 4 of the NLCS. The Astros \u2014 who still face some pretty unfavorable odds \u2014 have yet to name a starter; given how many relievers they trotted out in Game 3, it\u2019s unclear who they\u2019ll rely on for another crucial game.\n\nGame 4 is set for Saturday evening at 8:08 PM EDT.", "description": "The Astros finally broke their losing streak against the Nationals, pulling off a 4-1 win in Game 3 with the help of some standout pitching from Zack Greinke, key hits from Michael Brantley and Jose Altuve, and a tireless bullpen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://nbchardballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1183479591-e1572063461827.jpg?w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
