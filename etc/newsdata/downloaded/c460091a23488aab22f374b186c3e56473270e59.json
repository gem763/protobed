With some, I spent a couple of hours.\n\nMy colleague Laszlo Balogh from Hungary and I had decided to photograph Auschwitz survivors in Poland and Hungary ahead of the 70th anniversary of the camp's liberation this month, and to shoot the portraits in the same style.\n\nI arranged to meet the survivors in their homes and to spend a proper amount of time with them, mainly talking and listening rather than trying to shoot their portraits.\n\nBut halfway through the assignment I was invited to a weekly meeting of a survivors' association, who suggested we set up a \"studio\" at their premises.\n\nThen the hard part began. Even though I knew it was not the first time these people were sharing their stories, it was not easy for them to bring up memories and photographs of their tragic survival.\n\nIt really was a difficult day. After listening to those terrible stories, more than five in one day, I was exhausted -- physically, but more so mentally.\n\nI thought I could expect what I was going to hear but I don't think anyone could be prepared for such stories, and this many in one go.\n\nStories of survivors, stories of people who were children at the time.", "description": "Eighty-nine-year-old Auschwitz survivor Jadwiga Bogucka, pictured above holding a photograph of herself at the time, was 19 when she and her mother were sent from their house to a camp in the Polish city of Pruszkow and then by train to Auschwitz.", "authors": ["Kacper Pempel", "Laszlo Balogh"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQzBPIuEqcqMEE9M5VZUd9t6LWsNclqKxrEzVISwn1DZn0k8cDoR8IfjY7oHr05wkD-tuHGSIgkjZpbYCsYFxba15NyAyYuWpQHwr7DLTtjem"}
