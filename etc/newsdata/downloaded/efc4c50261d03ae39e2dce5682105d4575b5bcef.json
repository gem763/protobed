Based on Jessica Pressler\u2019s viral New York magazine story \u201cThe Hustlers at Scores,\u201d Scafaria\u2019s third film follows the eponymous hustlers at a Manhattan strip club as they move from pole dancing to glorified pickpocketing during an uneasy time in the American economy.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nSet both before and after the financial crisis of the mid-aughts, \u201cHustlers\u201d entertainingly dramatizes both the high-on-the-hog pre-collapse years at the club and what happens after (read: situations tough enough to make the hard-working ladies turn to crime to survive). In the middle of that shift between very different timelines, Scafaria finds the space for one last celebratory evening at the club, centered around the surprise appearance of a megastar patron. As word spreads backstage, the ladies freak out (Lizzo even screams, \u201cmotherfucking Usher is here!\u201d) and run to the stage, all the better to entertain a deep-pocketed and well-known guest.\n\nIt is indeed superstar Usher, and as Lopez\u2019s Ramona, Wu\u2019s Destiny, and their friends process his appearance in their crazy world, so too does the audience. Scafaria and cinematographer Todd Banhazl have a little fun with the singer\u2019s initial appearance, following him into the club from behind, only the back of his head visible. It\u2019s not entirely clear if it is Usher or just some lookalike, a playful twist on an already energetic scene. \u201cI was hoping people would go, \u2018Okay, she\u2019s saying it\u2019s him. Okay, no, that\u2019s just the back of someone\u2019s head. No, that\u2019s him!,'\u201d Scafaria said in a recent interview with IndieWire.\n\nLanding the \u201chim\u201d in question wasn\u2019t always guaranteed though, even though Scafaria first wrote the script with both Usher and his hit song that plays over the sequence (\u201cLove In This Club,\u201d of course) mentioned by name. \u201cYou just kind of wonder, who\u2019s actually going to play this role?,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so desperate for it to be him.\u201d\n\nHaving heavy-hitters like Lopez in the film helped make the connection, Scafaria said, and while getting the initial offer to the superstar wasn\u2019t that hard, convincing him he could play the role wasn\u2019t an easy ask. \u201cHe had some worries about whether or not he looked the same as he did in 2008, and I was like, \u2018You do,'\u201d the filmmaker said with a laugh. \u201cBut then he was concerned because his hair is different, so there was a day where I was Googling \u2018Usher and hats\u2019 and sending Usher pictures of himself in hats so he knew it was possible for him to step into the role. But then he really had fun with it and he brought his chain from that era, that jacket.\u201d\n\nThe scene, complete with Usher and his crew showering the dancers with money as they all happily crowd the stage together, serves as the last great night before everything goes topside. \u201cHustlers\u201d is framed around an after-everything interview between Destiny and Julia Stiles\u2019 Elizabeth (serving as a Pressler stand-in), and so while both the audience and Wu\u2019s character understand that it spells the end of something wonderful, the joy of it all is infectious. Scafaria \u2014 and Usher \u2014 felt that too.\n\n\u201cHe really knew what we were doing and the kind of celebration we were having there,\u201d Scafaria said. \u201cIt was a real treat and that was obviously my favorite day on set. It\u2019s the most surreal scene to shoot, because all the women were up on the stage together during that scene and that\u2019s when I had tears in my eyes, because I was just so excited to see them all celebrated in this way. It looked like a renaissance painting to me, it was so glorious. That was a pretty incredible day.\u201d\n\n\u201cHustlers\u201d is now in theaters.\n\nSign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.
