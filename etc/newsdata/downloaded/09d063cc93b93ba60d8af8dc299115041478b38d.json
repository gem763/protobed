The alleged incident is detailed in Mr. Mueller\u2019s 448-page report.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a copy of the report,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski responded.\n\nMr. Nadler started grilling Mr. Lewnadowski about details of the incident to which the former campaign manager repeated that he needed to review the report.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like you to refresh my memory,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a copy of the report.\u201d\n\nRep. Mary Gay Scanlon, Pennsylvania Democrat, ultimately brought a copy of the Mueller report over to Mr. Lewandowski.\n\nBut Mr. Lewandowski continued to fumble asking Mr. Nadler for a reference and which paragraph he was inquiring about.\n\nThe obfuscating sent the hearing into chaos as Republicans insisted that Mr. Nadler\u2019s time had run out, prompting GOPers to demand an end to the hearing.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
