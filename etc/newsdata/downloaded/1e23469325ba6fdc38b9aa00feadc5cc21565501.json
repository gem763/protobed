The study also found the internet sector indirectly supports another 13 million jobs.\n\nIn 2015, the Internet Association estimated the sector was responsible for an estimated $966.2 billion, or 6% GDP in 2014.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in April estimated the \"digital economy\" accounted for 6.9% of the 2017 U.S. GDP, or $1.35 trillion, in 2017, placing it in seventh place overall. That definition includes digital-enabling infrastructure, e-commerce transactions, and digital media but does not include ride-sharing services and other goods and services connected to the \"sharing\" economy.\n\nThe Internet Association study used Census, BEA, and SEC government data from 2018 to estimate the internet sector's contributions to the American economy. The group's chief economist, Christopher Hooton said the internet industry is \"creating jobs in every sector of the economy\" and said the new analysis more accurately captures the internet's economic impact.\n\nThe BEA study notes that employees working in the U.S. digital economy earned $132,223 in average compensation in 2017, compared to $68,506 per worker for the total U.S. economy.", "description": "Internet sector contributes $2.1 trillion to U.S. economy: industry group", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8P25F_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
