They\u2019ll be joining a market that\u2019s relatively young but fairly crowded. Some half-dozen big companies have made major plays for VR, and countless smaller ones have also launched or announced headsets. But these products cater to vastly different audiences, and sorting through them can be confusing \u2014 especially because VR headsets are sometimes announced very early, then delayed or outright canceled.\n\nIt would be almost impossible to catalog every virtual reality Kickstarter project or specialized professional device. But it\u2019s easier to lay out the biggest names in VR, what they\u2019re selling, who they\u2019re selling to, and why you should actually care.\n\nOculus\n\nWhy should you care about the company?\n\nOculus helped create the current VR wave by raising millions of dollars for its debut Oculus Rift headset on Kickstarter, and it\u2019s helped fund production of many well-known VR games and films. Also, it\u2019s owned by Facebook, so any kind of large-scale social VR push will probably start there.\n\nWhat\u2019s it making?\n\nPrimarily, three Oculus-branded headsets: the Oculus Go, the Quest, and the Rift S. The Oculus Go is a self-contained lower-end headset that supports simple interactions. The Quest is also self-contained, but it features full motion tracking and sophisticated hand controllers. The PC-powered Rift S is an upgraded version of the original Rift. Oculus also co-created the Samsung Gear VR headset, which is powered by Samsung phones.\n\nWho\u2019s the ideal customer?\n\nMostly consumers, although some companies do use them for professional VR. The Oculus Go is pitched as a VR video player, the Quest as a mass-market gaming console, and the Rift as a \u201cgold standard\u201d for VR gaming. The Quest, in particular, is built for user-friendliness and convenience, while forgoing cutting-edge experimental features and offering limited computing power.\n\nWhat\u2019s the price range?\n\n$129 plus the cost of a phone for the Gear VR, $199 for the Oculus Go, and $399 each for the Quest and Rift S. (You\u2019ll also need a PC for the Rift S.) You might find the Gear VR bundled for free with a Samsung phone, though.\n\nWhat can you actually buy?\n\nThe original Oculus Rift has been retired, but the Oculus Go and Gear VR are both available right now. You can preorder the Quest and Rift S; they\u2019ll start shipping on May 21st.\n\nHTC\n\nWhy should you care about the company?\n\nHTC co-created the Vive, the first major headset with a wide range of motion and full virtual hands. The Vive is one of the most appealing headsets for high-end VR gaming, and HTC has made a huge push into industrial VR as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s it making?\n\nThe increasingly expansive HTC Vive line of headsets. There\u2019s the core HTC Vive, a PC-powered high-end headset, and the Vive Pro, a high-resolution variant. The Vive Focus Plus is a standalone headset with inside-out motion tracking, similar to the Quest. And the enigmatic Vive Cosmos is supposed to be a PC-tethered device that could one day be powered by a phone. HTC has also supplemented these headsets with a tracking accessory that can be used in custom controllers.\n\nWho\u2019s the ideal customer?\n\nPrimarily businesses for training and simulations, product testing, computer design visualizations, and a variety of other purposes. The Vive is also popular with VR arcades, and HTC actually operates its own VR \u201cexperiential center\u201d known as Viveland. The upcoming Vive Cosmos, however, seems aimed more directly at home gaming fans.\n\nWhat\u2019s the price range?\n\n$499 for the Vive, $599 for the Vive Focus Plus, and $799 for the Vive Pro headset (plus the cost of tracking stations and controllers). HTC hasn\u2019t revealed a price for the Cosmos yet. The Vive, the Vive Pro, and the Cosmos all require a gaming PC as well.\n\nWhat can you actually buy?\n\nThe Vive and Vive Pro are both widely available. The Vive Focus Plus was released on April 15th in some markets, but it was delayed until later this month in others. And the Vive Cosmos release date is anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nValve\n\nWhy should you care about the company?\n\nValve was the Vive\u2019s other co-creator, responsible for the headset\u2019s innovative tracking system and the SteamVR software platform. Valve envisioned SteamVR as a whole ecosystem of headsets, and it\u2019s just announced a high-end SteamVR product called the Index. Also, Valve\u2019s Steam storefront has a near-monopoly on PC gaming, so it\u2019s fairly important outside of VR as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s it making?\n\nTechnically, the Vive, but that seems like HTC\u2019s territory now. Valve seems more focused on the upcoming Index, another PC-powered, high-end device. While the Index uses the Vive\u2019s tracking system, it features some screen improvements and a set of new, fascinatingly weird-looking \u201cKnuckles\u201d controllers.\n\nWho\u2019s the ideal customer?\n\nAs Polygon puts it, Valve is targeting \u201ca virtual reality enthusiast who (a) must have the latest thing and (b) enjoys sufficient disposable income to satisfy that desire.\u201d Valve is also touting a big \u201cflagship\u201d VR game this year. So we might safely assume it wants gaming fans \u2014 specifically, fans of its Half-Life and Portal series, according to some rumors \u2014 on board.\n\nWhat\u2019s the price range?\n\nThe full system is $999 plus the cost of a PC, which puts it way at the high end of consumer VR. On the bright side, Valve is selling the Index piecemeal, so Vive owners could reuse their old tracking systems or even just buy some new controllers.\n\nWhat can you actually buy?\n\nValve opened preorders for the Index on May 1st, and the first units are supposed to ship in June \u2014 although, as of right now, it\u2019s heavily backordered.\n\nSony\n\nWhy should you care about the company?\n\nBeyond being one of the world\u2019s biggest electronics and media companies, Sony\u2019s PlayStation VR has sold more than any other tethered headset \u2014 around 4.2 million units. It\u2019s also got connections with popular non-VR game studios that can bring exclusive games to its platform.\n\nWhat\u2019s it making?\n\nThe PlayStation VR, a wired headset that\u2019s powered by a PlayStation 4, bundled with a PlayStation Camera for tracking, and controlled by either the standard DualShock gamepad or the PlayStation Move motion controllers.\n\nWho\u2019s the ideal customer?\n\nPlayStation owners, naturally. Sony launched its headset for the PlayStation 4, but it\u2019s committed to supporting the device on an as-yet-unannounced fifth-generation console, so it seems to consider PSVR a long-term project.\n\nWhat\u2019s the price range?\n\nNot including the cost of a PlayStation 4 console, it\u2019s $249 or $299, depending on whether you want to add motion controllers. The headset usually comes bundled with a couple of games.\n\nWhat can you actually buy?\n\nThe PSVR has been on sale since November 2016. Sony is rumored to be working on a wireless second-generation headset, but if that\u2019s happening, we don\u2019t know when the device might be announced or released.\n\nGoogle\n\nWhy should you care about the company?\n\nGoogle introduced millions of people to VR with Cardboard, a cheap cardboard shell that turned almost any smartphone into a simple headset. It built on that success with the Android Daydream VR platform, and it\u2019s helped design 360-degree cameras to capture VR video. For now, it\u2019s seemingly relegated VR to the back burner, but it hasn\u2019t given up altogether.\n\nWhat\u2019s it making?\n\nThere\u2019s a Google-branded Cardboard headset, and Google advertises many other Cardboard-compatible shells on its site. On the Daydream side, Google offers the phone-powered Daydream View and the standalone Lenovo Mirage Solo, which has similar features to the Oculus Quest. The accompanying Lenovo Mirage Camera can either record 180-degree video or stream it to YouTube.\n\nWho\u2019s the ideal customer?\n\nAnybody who\u2019s lightly VR-curious or likes to watch a lot of immersive video. Google partnered with The New York Times to ship Cardboard viewers and distributed them to classrooms through the Expeditions program. And it spent years iterating on a VR version of YouTube \u2014 which isn\u2019t Cardboard- or Daydream-exclusive, but it came to those platforms first.\n\nWhat\u2019s the price range?\n\nFor Cardboard, it\u2019s often free since companies love giving it out as branded swag. (Obviously, you still need a phone to use it.) Otherwise, you can get an official Cardboard headset for $15, a Daydream View for $99, and a Mirage Solo for $399.\n\nWhat can you actually buy?\n\nEverything above is already on sale. But the Daydream View\u2019s future, at least, seems uncertain.\n\nDaydream never got much traction, and Google is focusing more on augmented reality than virtual reality right now. Samsung\u2019s flagship Galaxy S10 line doesn\u2019t support the headset, and neither does Google\u2019s own Pixel 3A, which was announced last week.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nWhy should you care about the company?\n\nMicrosoft Windows is the world\u2019s most popular desktop and laptop operating system, and while Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One isn\u2019t the most popular gaming console, it\u2019s still a huge platform. So the company has a real opportunity to promote VR, and it\u2019s shown an interest in doing just that, albeit only on Windows so far.\n\nWhat\u2019s it making?\n\nMicrosoft partners with manufacturers on the \u201cWindows Mixed Reality\u201d line of PC-powered VR headsets, which use the same platform and interface but vary in specs and style. (They\u2019re different from the HoloLens headset because, yes, Microsoft\u2019s naming scheme is deeply confusing.) Microsoft was one of the first companies to push for getting rid of external tracking devices on tethered headsets, although Oculus recently followed suit with the Rift S. Its partners have included Acer, Lenovo, HP, and Samsung.\n\nWho\u2019s the ideal customer?\n\nBusinesses that are already using Windows and want relatively cheap virtual reality headsets that don\u2019t require a lot of setup. Windows Mixed Reality headsets can also work with Steam games, so they\u2019re a feasible lower-end alternative to the Rift or Vive.\n\nWhat\u2019s the price range?\n\nThe cheapest headsets cost $299 without motion controllers, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets have generally hovered between $300 and $600 \u2014 although not all of these products are still on sale.\n\nWhat can you actually buy?\n\nMicrosoft currently sells the Samsung Odyssey for $350, its successor the Odyssey+ for $499, and a headset from Asus for $399. Acer, Dell, and Lenovo also sell headsets through third-party retailers like Amazon. The HP Reverb was supposed to have launched earlier this month, but that date seems to have slipped.\n\nNintendo\n\nWhy should you care about the company?\n\nIt made many people\u2019s most beloved games and gaming devices, and it currently sells the unique and popular Switch console. Nintendo was also designing VR hardware before some of these other companies even existed... although, admittedly, the results were the awkward Power Glove and the infamous Virtual Boy.\n\nWhat\u2019s it making?\n\nThe Labo VR, a whimsical Google Cardboard-like kit that turns a Switch into a handheld virtual reality headset. You can use the kit to make a variety of accessories: there\u2019s a cardboard blaster gun, a foot pedal, an elephant mask where the trunk is a simple controller, a bird whose \u201cwings\u201d you can flap to fly, and a camera that lets you take pictures of virtual worlds.\n\nWho\u2019s the ideal customer?\n\nNintendo is targeting a younger audience with the Labo VR\u2019s toy-like design. As with other Labo kits, you\u2019ll spend a lot of time assembling the cardboard accessories. There\u2019s no head strap, so you have to physically hold the goggles up, likely for relatively brief stretches. And there\u2019s an educational component that teaches kids exactly how the different pieces work.\n\nWhat\u2019s the price range?\n\nYou can pay $39 for a starter kit that lets you build the goggles and blaster or get the full array of accessories for $79. (Obviously, you\u2019ll need a Nintendo Switch, too.)\n\nWhat can you actually buy?\n\nThe Labo VR kit launched this spring, and it\u2019s widely available.\n\nThe rest\n\nThese big brands aren\u2019t the only companies working in VR. You can find other headsets at retail outlets, on crowdfunding platforms, and in workplaces. Many of these are cheaper mass-market variants of Google Cardboard. Others serve an extremely specific need, like the Varjo VR-1, which caters to business customers who need high resolutions but not a wide field of view. Some countries, particularly China, have a distinct VR ecosystem. Companies like Oculus want to pull the VR market into the mainstream, but it\u2019s still a very weird place.", "description": "A guide to major virtual reality companies and headsets \u2014 like the Oculus Quest, Valve Index, HTC Vive, and Nintendo Labo VR \u2014 for the spring of 2019.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "May"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ZhUNTFTva51f3suYsyrO-oRVNk=/0x52:2040x1120/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16200453/akrales_190429_3371_0087.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-16"}
