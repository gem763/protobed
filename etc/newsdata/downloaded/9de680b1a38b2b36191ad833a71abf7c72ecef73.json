It is a cultural norm that pervades not only those in power, but which also infiltrates the psyche of our society, most notably among men.\n\nThe harmful ways in which the patriarchy constrains men is thought to be a dominant factor behind a rise in male suicides. During 2018, the number of people who died by suicide in the UK rose by almost 12 per cent, with men three times more likely to die by suicide than women.\n\nThe gendered expectations which promote emotional repression and stigma are nowhere more visible than in our current prime minister\u2019s misogynistic language and behaviours. Boris Johnson unashamedly referred to a peer as a \u201cgirly swot\u201d recently, though not for the first time. Not only do his words highlight his sexist views, they also amplify the competitive alpha dominance and the social expectation on men to assert aggression as often as possible.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

This, in turn, deters men from reaching out for professional help, leaving them floundering in a world mired in stereotypes and gender conformity.\n\nMockery as medicine is beginning to be phased out. We have a greater awareness of language and its impact. No longer are phrases like \u201cman up\u201d, \u201cboys don\u2019t cry\u201d, \u201cboys will be boys\u201d acceptable in our playgrounds. Our future society will undoubtedly be better off for it. But as children shun the codes of colours and language, toys and aspirations while peers and leaders scoff at political correctness and human rights, for the grown men struggling now, navigating this world is desolate and isolating.\n\nFor generations, the toxic belief that work and lifestyle should be split along gender lines has informed the social norms men must practise in order to be identified as \u201cmale\u201d. This division has been countered by moves towards equality, from proportional representation in traditionally perceived \u201cmale professions\u201d to increased paternity leave. Disentangling ourselves from the perceived weakness of collaboration has proven benefits, emotionally and economically. With the dismantling of the patriarchy, so too are men liberated.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Biggest lies told by Boris Johnson Show all 5 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

The idea of collaboration is treated with disdain and requesting a reprieve in the Brexit negotiations in the form of an extension has Johnson baulking, even if it costs him his job. This self-destructive stance is synonymous with toxic masculinity, the male ego, at once fragile and immovable.\n\nA no-deal Brexit looks reckless but repeated warnings of economic crises are ignored. Concession and compromise are shunned and risk-taking is heroic, as long as men are the ones taking the risks. The white and wealthy, historically, hold little liability. Yet from this viewpoint the strong and stable look stunted and insecure.\n\nPublic debate could lead us to believe that political discourse is entirely polarised \u2013 Leave or Remain, red or blue, workers and shirkers \u2013 but, as with gender, politics is nuanced.\n\nOnline communities would have us believe that to eschew popular views is to shout into an abyss, our socio-political bubbles impenetrable. But there is rarely a binary distinction, as evidenced by Labour Leavers and defecting Tory Remainers. By subscribing to a black-and-white mindset, we fail to understand each other, we fail to recognise views different to our own and we are more prone to miseducation, ignorance and political impotence.\n\nThe rapid cultural shift towards acceptance and understanding that gender is a social construct, particularly among millennials and the following Generation Z, will undoubtedly change how future society reacts to leaders, their understanding of manhood and all its inherent toxicity.\n\nIn the 2017 general election, more than half of 18 to 24-year-olds voted cast their ballot in the highest youth turnout in 25 years, overwhelmingly calling for a Labour government. When Jeremy Corbyn met with Sinn Fein in the 1980s and 90s, saying, \u201cI want to see peace through dialogue\u201d, he was vilified as a terrorist sympathiser, a traitor rather than a progressive who was willing to listen and understand the views of others. Again, grace and humanity \u2013 attributes typically viewed as \u201cfemale\u201d \u2013 invoke contempt when coming from a man.\n\nCorbyn is often derided as too soft-spoken, weak or mentally unfit, it seems when attacking the capabilities of leaders in pursuit of status, even mental health is an easy target. The statistics show that it\u2019s a jibe that can have tragic consequences.\n\nFollowing almost a decade of austerity, the atrophied political landscape is desperate for regeneration. In the 2017 general election, young people spoke. Loudly. It is imperative that when the campaign trail next gears up, they hold our leaders accountable and let them know that the politics of machismo, characterised by violent threats and derision of the vulnerable, has no place.
