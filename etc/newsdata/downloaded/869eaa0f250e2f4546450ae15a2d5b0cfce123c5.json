Will it have to rethink possible?\n\nThe fund run by Paul Singer disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in the company on Monday, sending its shares up by as much as 5% and even eliciting an approving tweet from President Trump. AT&T appeared in Elliott\u2019s crosshairs after years of poor deal making and a languishing share price. Undoing Mr. Stephenson\u2019s work isn\u2019t simple, though.\n\nWhen he took over the company in 2007, Apple \u2019s iPhone had only just hit the shelves. Mr. Stephenson started off with a smart decision to make wireless the cornerstone of the company\u2019s growth, using the iPhone to gain wireless market share.\n\nBut the bump from iPhone exclusivity eventually faded and the company\u2019s big landline business withered. Then the strategic decisions that Mr. Singer later criticized began. In 2015, well into Netflix \u2019s rise, AT&T spent $49 billion on DirecTV. In 2016, he launched an ambitious deal to buy Time Warner, battling regulators. Elliott\u2019s letter criticized both deals, pointing out the company\u2019s lack of growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization despite the acquisition spree. AT&T\u2019s shares have produced a total return of 80% since Mr. Stephenson\u2019s arrival. Cable-and-entertainment rival Comcast \u2019s shareholders have more than tripled their money while wireless rival Verizon \u2019s shareholders have gained around 150%. The Time Warner deal was nothing short of a remake for AT&T but resulted in a heavy debt load and Mr. Stephenson\u2019s commitment to maintaining the rich dividend. Going head to head with the likes of Netflix and Walt Disney while managing the dual cash drains of paying lenders and rewarding shareholders won\u2019t be easy, so selling off certain assets and dismantling of the deals that Mr. Stephenson has worked so hard to create might make sense. In its letter, Elliott commended Time Warner\u2019s business but criticized AT&T\u2019s failure to \u201carticulate a clear strategic rationale for why AT&T needs to own Time Warner.\u201d But marrying distribution, including DirecTV, with Time Warner\u2019s content was the rationale for the deal. And DirecTV is housed in the AT&T\u2019s entertainment division, which also includes its dwindling legacy voice-and-data business as well as its U-verse cable assets. The entire division could be worth what AT&T paid for DirecTV alone based on its $4.7 billion 2018 operating contribution. Elliott has the bandwidth to influence AT&T, but it risks poor reception.\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
