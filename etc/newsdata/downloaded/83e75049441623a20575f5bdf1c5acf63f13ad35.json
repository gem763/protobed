Nor has the White House publicly affirmed an 11 month-old CIA assessment that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) ordered the assassination.\n\nCorporate America, on the other hand, seemed at least willing to publicly shame MBS.\n\nDozens of top Wall Street and business executives canceled plans to attend a massive investment conference in Riyadh, nicknamed \"Davos in the Desert\" and hosted by MBS.\n\nAmong them were BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, venture capitalist Steve Case, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, and World Bank president Jim Yong Kim.\n\nAll of the event's media sponsors also bailed, including both CNBC and FOX Business.\n\nBut apparently a year heals all wounds.\n\nMBS is once again hosting his prized event, beginning on October 29, and he wouldn't have risked a repeat embarrassment.\n\nBlackRock's Larry Fink is attending this time. Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat is also on the list, per The Washington Post. SoftBank simply isn't commenting on whether or not its CEO will be there.\n\nThe White House also will send a delegation, led by Jared Kushner. Last year, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin canceled, but then attended an anti-terrorism financing event that was expected to \"include participation by Saudi security services under scrutiny in Khashoggi\u2019s death.\"\n\nThe big picture: Most of these big companies never stopped doing business with the Saudis. Or, in the case of Wall Street, trying to get Saudi business. That's particularly true when it comes to deals like the upcoming Aramco IPO, which could be the largest global float of all time.\n\nAs we wrote at the time: It's much easier to bail on a conference than it is to unwind complex and lucrative business relationships.\n\nThe bottom line: MBS bet that Trump didn't care and that CEOs didn't care enough. He was right.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to clarify the network name is FOX Business, not FOX Business Channel.", "description": "MBS bet that CEOs didn't care enough, and he was right.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/4JzIEKhulQhGLvq04c5RPtpMdk0=/0x527:4314x2954/1920x1080/2019/10/02/1570008223070.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
