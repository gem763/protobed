Fundamentally, that\u2019s a different kind of mind-set, and that\u2019s a mind-set that tends to align more with Democratic candidates and the Democratic Party.\u201d O\u2019Rourke still lost the two giant suburban counties north of Dallas\u2014Collin and Denton\u2014but by less than 50,000 votes (compared with over 170,000 votes for Obama).\n\nJames Dickey, the chair of the state Republican Party, is also intently watching the Dallas area. He notes that Republicans won nine state House seats\u2014the exact number Democrats need to capture the chamber\u2014by five percentage points or less, and that seven of them are in the Dallas/Fort Worth metro area. \u201cThe question is whether that is a trend, or a [temporary] dip,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe answer is: That depends on us. Will we do the work necessary to make sure to win back the geographic areas that we had as recently as 2014?\u201d\n\nDemocrats\u2019 gains in metro Texas have been helped by two currents. The first is growing diversity. Since 2010, census figures show, the state has added 1.9 million new Latino residents, 541,000 African Americans, and 473,000 Asians, along with just 484,000 whites. That translates to nonwhites accounting for six of every seven residents the state has added over nearly the past decade. The demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution shared figures with me that show whites accounting for only about one-third of the state population younger than 30. Many of the suburban counties that once delivered reliable Republican majorities have changed substantially. \u201cThese are not the suburbs of the 1960s and 1970s,\u201d Blank says. \u201cThese suburbs are significantly more diverse; they are significantly younger.\u201d Since 2010, the number of eligible Latino voters has increased by at least 10 percent in five of the six suburban U.S. House districts Democrats are targeting next year, while the African and Asian American populations have grown even faster in most of them.\n\nBoth in 2016 and 2018, exit polls show that nonwhites cast 43 percent of the statewide vote. But the march toward a majority nonwhite electorate has been significantly slowed by lackluster turnout, particularly among Latinos. The Democratic firm Latino Decisions recently reported that while turnout from eligible Latinos in Texas soared from 1.1 million in 2014 to 1.9 million in 2018, the number of nonvoters dwarfed those who participated: 1.7 million Latinos who were registered to vote did not turn out, and 2 million more who are eligible have not yet registered. That huge gap threatens to again dilute the community\u2019s impact in 2020, and despite all of Trump\u2019s provocations, many Democrats are skeptical that the party knows how to significantly increase Latino engagement in Texas\u2014a state with few unions that can organize these voters (as they do in Nevada) and with restrictive laws that hobble voter-registration drives.", "description": "The wave of House Republican retirements from the Lone Star State shows how quickly politics are changing in the nation\u2019s second-largest Electoral College prize.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS24ZEL/facebook.jpg?1567628703", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
