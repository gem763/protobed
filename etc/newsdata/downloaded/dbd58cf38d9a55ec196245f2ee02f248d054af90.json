(Picture: Warner Bros; Rex)\n\n***Joker Spoilers Ahead***\n\nThe film on everyone\u2019s mind at the moment is Joker. Whether you loved or hated Todd Phillips\u2019 dark take on Batman\u2019s greatest foe, it\u2019s top of the box office and has everyone talking about what\u2019s next for the world of DC. Phillips and others have maintained that Joker is a standalone film, not intended to have any sequel or tie to the DC Extended Universe.\n\nHowever\u2026 this is Hollywood. Plans can change very quickly, particularly if a certain way of working proves to be profitable. The door has certainly been left open for a connection to Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman \u2013 the closing moments of the film saw the fabled murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne, while reports that The Batman will be set in The \u201990s would work with Joker\u2019s early 80\u2019s setting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut could an adult-oriented Batman be possible? Following a decade of Marvel dominance, could DC find a way to compete with the Avengers juggernaut by marketing themselves to an older audience, out for something darker than the average blockbuster can provide?\n\nBringing a level of R-Rated grit to the world of Batman would be a lot easier than most characters. Many of the comics have featured grisly murders or assaults, while some of Batman\u2019s adventures in animation and video games have gone further than his PG movie equivalents have been allowed to. The very first Batman comic featured The Caped Crusader hanging a criminal in mid-air. On the big screen, Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight Trilogy featured a degree of realism unmatched by most comic book movies, but to push the boundaries that Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix pushed in Joker would involve a shift that would be unusual in Hollywood.\n\nBatman films have walked a fine line when it comes to violence \u2013 Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker impaled a man\u2019s head on a pencil in The Dark Knight, while Ben Affleck breaks Batman\u2019s long-held \u2018no killing\u2019 rule in Batman V Superman. However, these scenes were shot in such a way that the violence was either off-screen at a crucial moment, or bloodless.\n\nJoaquin\u2019s Joker showed gruesome, detailed deaths (Picture: Warner Bros.)\n\nJoker features very gruesome, detailed deaths, and it\u2019s not just about the blood. Aside from the violence, the film also tackles issues of mental illness and child abuse. Would we see Robert Pattinson grapple with PTSD, or beat a suspect to a gruesome pulp prompted by past trauma? We\u2019ve seen Bruce Wayne deal with his issues in a very PG way in films like Batman Forever, but to go deep inside the mind of someone with as harrowing an origin story would be risky in an industry that wants to market films to as wide an audience as possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to experiment with The Joker, a character who can be rebooted very quickly (just ask Jared Leto), but not with a character the studios will be hoping to make billion-dollar box office from. That said, with Aquaman becoming the most successful DC movie ever last year, maybe he and Wonder Woman will be the family-friendly crowd-pleasers while DC goes in a more cerebral direction with their most famous title.\n\nWhether The Batman is unconnected to Joker, follows its themes closely, or (most likely) has a loose connection in terms of timeline, there\u2019s one thing Reeves would be wise to adhere to. However gruesome things get, Batman can\u2019t be the one doing the killing. Ben Affleck\u2019s body count in Batman V Superman drew criticism from purists, who argue that the vow to never kill is at the core of who the character has become over the years. However unsettling things get in Gotham, that\u2019s one rule many fans would hate to see broken.\n\nMORE: Robert Pattinson literally has no clue how he got the role as the new Batman but we\u2019re here for it", "description": "We look at the likelihood of The Batman being as hard-hitting as Todd Phillips' new hit.", "authors": ["James Luxford"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_82916172_1571046174.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
