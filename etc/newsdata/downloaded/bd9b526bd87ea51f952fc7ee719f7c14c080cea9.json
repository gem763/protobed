(Elaine Thompson/AP Photo)\n\nFollow along here for live updates as the Los Angeles Rams face the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday night.\n\nIn-game updates\n\n1st Quarter\n\nSeahawks strike quickly for lead: The Seahawks, after losing a fumble and being forced to punt on their first two possessions, struck quickly for a touchdown on their third drive of the night. Russell Wilson threw a 13-yard scoring pass to wide receiver Tyler Lockett, who somehow managed to get his feet in bounds to make a superb catch in the back left corner of the end zone. Wilson had moved out of the pocket on the previous play to find wide-open tight end Will Dissly for a 38-yard gain. (Seahawks 7, Rams 6 with 49 seconds left in the 1st quarter)\n\nGurley getting carries: Todd Gurley got six carries in the first nine minutes of this game, already one more than he had during the Rams\u2019 loss to the Buccaneers on Sunday. He has 31 rushing yards and the Rams have the early lead in Seattle on a pair of field goals by kicker Greg Zuerlein. He connected from 32 yards after a Gurley-led drive stalled at the Seattle 14-yard line. The Seahawks, meanwhile, have done next to nothing so far on offense and have been unable to block the Rams\u2019 Aaron Donald. (Rams 6, Seahawks 0 with 4:55 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nRams get FG after TO on reversal: The Rams forced an early turnover by the Seahawks, thanks to an instant replay reversal. The Rams\u2019 Nickell Robey-Coleman stripped the football from Seattle\u2019s Jaron Brown as he ran along the sideline after a catch. Brown originally was ruled to be out of bounds, it appeared, before he lost the ball and the Rams recovered the fumble. But the Rams challenged and were awarded possession of the ball at the Seattle 33-yard line. Todd Gurley ran for nine yards on the Rams\u2019 first offensive play. But he was thrown for a five-yard loss on the next play and the Rams settled for a 47-yard field goal by kicker Greg Zuerlein.

But they enter this game four days after a troubling loss Sunday at home to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in which they surrendered 55 points.\n\nQuarterback Jared Goff threw for 517 yards and two touchdowns in that game. He tied the single-game NFL record with 45 completions. But he also threw two interceptions and the Rams abandoned their running game. Todd Gurley and Malcolm Brown had only 10 carries between them, while Goff had 68 passing attempts.\n\nHow to watch\n\nWhen: Thursday at 8:20 p.m. Eastern\n\nWhere: CenturyLink Field in Seattle\n\nTV: Fox, NFL Network\n\nStreaming: Amazon Prime, fuboTV\n\nIdeally, Coach Sean McVay and the Rams would get back to the approach that has been most effective for them: establishing the running game and then allowing everything else they do on offense to work off that. The Rams are ranked 22nd in the league in rushing offense and Gurley has a total of 49 carries in four games in a season that began with lingering questions about his previous knee issues.\n\nGoff has won his last nine starts against NFC West opponents. His favorite target so far this season has been wide receiver Cooper Kupp, who ranks second in the NFL in receiving yards in his return from last season\u2019s torn ACL in his left knee.\n\nThe winner of this game, with both teams at 3-1, moves into second place in the rugged NFC West behind the unbeaten San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks are coming off a triumph Sunday at Arizona in which they rebounded from a loss at home to the New Orleans Saints. The 49ers host the Cleveland Browns this week on \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d\n\nLeft tackle Duane Brown is listed as questionable for the Seahawks because of a biceps injury, but participated fully in Wednesday\u2019s practice and is expected to play tonight. The Seattle offensive line must protect quarterback Russell Wilson from a Rams\u2019 pass rush led by Aaron Donald, who has 6.5 sacks in his last three games against the Seahawks, and Clay Matthews, who has a team-leading five sacks this season. Wilson is the NFC\u2019s top-rated passer this season.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nHow Gardner Minshew went from college nomad to mustachioed cult hero to NFL\u2019s top rookie\n\nBest bets for NFL Week 5: Count on the Cowboys, Steelers and Raiders\n\nFinding the next Sean McVay has proved elusive as losses pile up for first-year NFL coaches", "description": "The winner will be in second place in the rugged NFC West behind the undefeated 49ers.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl", "October At Pm", "Mark Maske Covers The Nfl For The Washington Post.
