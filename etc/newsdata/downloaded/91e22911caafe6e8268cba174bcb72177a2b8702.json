While that day will forever be a painful reminder to her, there\u2019s also another day that Nicole has been dreading since the tragedy \u2014 this past Monday.\n\nOpening up in an emotional post on Twitter this week, Hockley revealed that Sept. 23, 2019 officially marked the number of days that Dylan had been gone longer than he was alive.\n\n\u201cToday it\u2019s been 2,474 days since Dylan was murdered at Sandy Hook. 2,474 days since he\u2019s been gone from my life,\u201d she wrote beside a photo of Dylan smiling in a Superman shirt. \u201cHe was only in my life for 2,473 days.\u201d\n\nToday it's been 2,474 days since Dylan was murdered at Sandy Hook. 2,474 days since he's been gone from my life. He was only in my life for 2,473 days. I feared today. Would him being gone longer than he was here mean I would forget him? pic.twitter.com/8N8jWPJr6k \u2014 Nicole Hockley (@NicoleHockley) September 24, 2019\n\nRELATED: Return to Newtown: How the Sandy Hook Victims Live on in the Hearts and Work of Their Families\n\nThough Hockley admitted that she dreaded this day for fear of forgetting her son, the Newtown mother was reassured by the fact that no matter how many days go by, Dylan\u2019s memory would always live on in the hearts and souls of those who loved him.\n\n\u201cI feared today. Would him being gone longer than he was here mean I would forget him? His laugh, his eyes, the smell of his hair, his voice, the feel of his hand in mine?\u201d Hockley asked. \u201cI am sad today, but I no longer have fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have forgotten nothing. My son lives on in my heart, in my soul, in the memories of our family and friends and in the work of me and his Daddy,\u201d she added. \u201cWe will always love him and miss him. My butterfly is gone, but never forgotten, no matter how many days go by.\u201d\n\nHockley previously opened up to PEOPLE and explained the reasoning behind her \u201cbutterfly\u201d nickname for Dylan.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a theory that if a butterfly flaps his wings on one side of the world, it can cause a hurricane on the other,\u201d she said. \u201cDylan is my butterfly. When I visit schools and look at the kids, I see butterflies. They\u2019re the ones who are going to create the change that will change our country.\u201d\n\nDylan Hockley | Courtesy More\n\nRELATED: Sandy Hook Mom Nicole Hockley Is One of PEOPLE\u2019s 25 Women Changing the World: \u2018Gun Violence Is Preventable\u2019\n\nSince the first grader\u2019s tragic passing, Hockley has co-founded Sandy Hook Promise, a non-profit organization that focuses on honoring victims of gun violence and providing awareness and education to prevent these shootings from happening again.\n\nThe organization established chapters in all 50 states and focuses on a \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach to preventing gun violence that, according to Hockley, includes \u201cteaching how to know the signs of people at risk of hurting themselves or someone else, how to recognize the signs of chronic social isolation and how to practice inclusivity.\u201d\n\nThe Connecticut mom spoke to PEOPLE in 2016, shortly after being named one of PEOPLE\u2019s 25 Women Changing the World, and emphasized her desire to ensure that no other parent experiences such an unimaginable loss.", "description": "Sandy Hook Mom Nicole Hockley Writes Emotional Tribute to Her Late Son", "authors": ["Joelle Goldstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7CXv6azu4LhvM1o2A1hOqQ--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/5a4b83967562fcaf83f9386bbbf6b788", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
