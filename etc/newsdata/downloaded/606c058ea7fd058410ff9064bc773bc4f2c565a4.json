I also saw how these records don't follow migrants between facilities and transfers of custody,\u201d Underwood said on the House floor ahead of the vote.\n\n\u201cAs DHS works to improve its medical screening of children and migrants at the border to ensure there is a minimum standard of care, the need for proper record keeping on those screenings will only increase,\u201d she added.\n\nCritics of the legislation say the focus should be on preventing border crossings and moving detainees out of Border Patrol custody and into Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.\n\n\u201cI oppose this bill because it is poorly conceived, erroneously drafted and extremely risky. This bill would require the Border Patrol to divert resources from its core missions and create a new medical screening for those who illegally cross and enter the country between ports of entry,\u201d Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) said during floor debate.\n\n\u201cI believe every part of that is wrongheaded. However, even if you agree with the policy, this is not the way to do it. Handing DHS And CBP a 30-day mandate to put an electronic records system in place has no basis in reality.\u201d\n\nThe legislation faces long odds of advancing in the Republican-controlled Senate.", "description": "The House passed a measure Thursday that would revamp medical screenings for migrants in the custody of\u00a0Customs and Border Protection (CBP).", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/immigrants_el_paso_04142019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
