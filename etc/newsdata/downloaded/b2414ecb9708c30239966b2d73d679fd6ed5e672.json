[Oct 30, 2019]", "language": "en", "text": "DID YOU HEAR THAT NOISE?\n\nLizzie: Turn the volume down, George.\n\nGeorge: Why? This is the best part of the film.\n\nLizzie: Please, just turn the volume down for a minute.\n\nGeorge: Alright \u2026\n\nLizzie: Did you hear that? The banging sound next door?\n\nGeorge: Banging? That\u2019s just what\u2019s on TV.\n\nLizzie: No. It wasn't. It came from next door. It sounded like someone\u2019s banging on the wall. There ... there it is again! You must have heard it this time.\n\nGeorge: Geez! You\u2019re hearing things.\n\nLizzie: No! I\u2019m certain there\u2019s something going on next door.\n\nGeorge: They\u2019re probably doing repairs.\n\nLizzie: Not at this hour. And also, there\u2019s no one at home. The Cheungs are away on holiday visiting Mrs Cheung\u2019s sister in Australia. She told me last week when I was chatting to her in the lift.\n\nGeorge: Please, Lizzie. Can I just watch \u2026 oh \u2026 okay, you\u2019re right. I can hear a faint rapping on the wall.\n\nLizzie: I told you!\n\nGeorge: What was that?! Did you hear a shrieking sound?\n\nLizzie: I think you should go over and find out what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t like this at all. For all you know, someone might be in danger.\n\nGeorge: Nah. What happens next door is none of our business. Can we just go back to watching the film? Oh ... that\u2019s odd. Why is the screen flickering? It was fine earlier. Now it\u2019s playing the film backwards. Lizzie, do you have the remote?\n\nLizzie: You are holding it. Oh great! And now the lights are off. The fuse box must have tripped. Can you reset it?\n\nGeorge: Hold on. There\u2019s a banging sound again, but it\u2019s coming from above this time. I\u2019ll go upstairs and check it out. I\u2019ll be right back.\n\nLizzie: George, look at the TV. It\u2019s changing channels by itself and I hear someone humming. The room has suddenly turned cold and we\u2019re in the middle of summer. This is really creeping me out. I\u2019m coming with you.\n\nGeorge: You\u2019re right. Either way, I\u2019ll call the concierge and find out what\u2019s going on before we jump to conclusions. Where\u2019s your phone?\n\nLizzie: Here you go.\n\nGeorge: The battery\u2019s dead.\n\nLizzie: No. It can\u2019t be. I charged it just before we sat down to watch the film. I\u2019m seriously freaking out now. George! Someone\u2019s smashing up things in the kitchen \u2026 crikey! I swore I just saw a strange shadow darting into the corner. Let\u2019s get out of here RIGHT NOW!\n\nEnd", "description": "Lizzie and her brother George are at home when they hear a loud banging sound.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/shutterstock_1458803339_script_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
