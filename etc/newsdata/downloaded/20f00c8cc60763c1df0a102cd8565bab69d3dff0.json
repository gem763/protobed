News: \"North is trying to get in on the makeup, but she's being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager.\"\n\n\"It's a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now but it is what's best.\n\n\"I think as a parent you just learn and figure it out as you go and we realised we didn't really want her to wear makeup at a young age but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nKanye, 42, first ruled out North's growing interest in make-up last month, but has previously allowed his little girl to wear it many other times.\n\nThe couple's eldest child has been seen wearing make-up on multiple occasions, including bright orange eyeshadow and red lipstick.\n\nThe brunette beauty told E! when her husband first stopped North wearing make-up: \"I think he had it [with North's make-up so] he changed all the rules.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: EMPICS Entertainment)\n\n\"I'd let her wear, you know, she has a little red for Christmas, I'd let her wear a red lip, or I'd let her do one pop of something. I'd let her if she's wearing a black dress, a black lip.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images for ULTA Beauty / K)\n\nBut it doesn't help that Kylie Jenner generously gives North all of the lip kits from her Kylie Cosmetics beauty brand.\n\n\"I kind of got in trouble for that, too. So, it's now no more makeup,\" Kim continued.\n\n(Image: Jawad Elatab / SplashNews.com)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nRapper Kanye also spoke about his new rules for North's clothes.\n\nHe revealed on Apple Music's Beats 1 that when North was young he wanted her to look like a pop star.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nHe said: \"I was literally out there making [North] try to out dress Rihanna .\n\n\"I don't think North should wear a crop top after I had her wear a slip dress when she was two years old. I think and feel differently now that I am Christian,\" he said regrettingly.", "description": "The rapper has taken his new conservative views to the extreme which is causing rifts with wife Kim Kardashian", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Instagram", "Wireimage", "Empics Entertainment", "Getty Images For Ulta Beauty", "K", "Jawad Elatab", "Splashnews.Com", "Daily Record"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728833.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Fashion-Group-International-Night-of-Stars-2019-New-York.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
