According to 911 calls obtained by local media, Parks told emergency responders that Springer had been accidentally shot by the dog.\n\nAn officer who responded to the emergency found three shell casings and a burn mark under the center console consistent with Parks\u2019s story, according to a police report obtained by The Washington Post. The report noted that Parks\u2019s and Springer\u2019s stories matched up and that officers did not suspect foul play.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard of a dog shooting a person,\u201d Sgt.
