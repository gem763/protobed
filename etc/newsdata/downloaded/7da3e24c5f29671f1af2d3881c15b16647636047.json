The Michael who started in pre-season is different, the confidence has come.\u2019\n\nKeane\u2019s rehabilitation has continued since then. There is still room for improvements and it has not been easy in an Everton team that continues to under-perform.\n\nDefeat on his return to Turf Moor was the club\u2019s fourth in a row in the Premier League, putting Silva under more pressure going into the international break.\n\nMichael Keane joined Everton from Burnley who banked a club record \u00a325m in 2017\n\nKeane will spend it with the England squad for the games against Czech Republic and Bulgaria having regained his place under Gareth Southgate.\n\nThe 26-year-old played 90 minutes alongside Harry Maguire against Kosovo and Bulgaria last month, and was a natural inclusion when Southgate named his squad earlier this week.\n\nThere was enough evidence to explain why at Turf Moor even though he ended up on the losing side again after Everton were forced to play with 10 men after Seamus Coleman was sent off shortly after half-time.\n\nMichael Keane's improved form has seen him called up to the England squad in recent games\n\nKeane just about shaded the physical battle with his old teammate Ashley Barnes who was replaced by Jay Rodriguez moments after Jeff Hendrick scored the winner.\n\nKeane could do little about the goal, throwing himself towards the near post in vain as Hendrick arrived to volley home from a tight angle.\n\nA crunching tackle on substitute Charlie Taylor towards the end prevented the damage from being any worse for an Everton team who offered painfully little going forward.\n\nTheir problems show no sign of abating anytime soon, and that has been the case for so much of Keane\u2019s career at Goodison. It makes you wonder how he would have benefitted from a more stable working environment.\n\nClearly more challenges lie ahead, but at least if feels as though the really dark days are behind him.", "description": "Michael Keane initially struggled for both form and confidence after leaving Burnley for Everton in 2017.
