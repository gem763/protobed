State energy producer Saudi Aramco lost about 5.7 million barrels per day of output on Saturday after 10 unmanned aerial vehicles struck the world\u2019s biggest crude-processing facility in Abqaiq and the kingdom\u2019s second-biggest oil field in Khurais.\n\nFor oil markets, it\u2019s the single worst sudden disruption ever, surpassing the loss of Kuwaiti and Iraqi petroleum supply in August 1990, when Saddam Hussein invaded his neighbor. It also exceeds the loss of Iranian oil output in 1979 during the Islamic Revolution, according to data from the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\n\u201cNo matter whether it takes Saudi Arabia five days or a lot longer to get oil back into production, there is but one rational takeaway from this weekend\u2019s drone attacks on the Kingdom\u2019s infrastructure -- that infrastructure is highly vulnerable to attack, and the market has been persistently mispricing oil,\u201d Citigroup Inc.\u2019s Ed Morse wrote in a research note.\n\nSaudi Arabia can restart a significant volume of the halted oil production within days, but needs weeks to restore full output capacity, people familiar with the matter said. The kingdom -- or its customers -- may use stockpiles to keep oil supplies flowing in the short term. Aramco could consider declaring itself unable to fulfill contracts on some international shipments -- known as force majeure -- if the resumption of full capacity at Abqaiq takes weeks.\n\nThat would rattle oil markets and cast a shadow on Aramco\u2019s preparations for what could be the world\u2019s biggest initial public offering. It\u2019s also set to escalate a showdown pitting Saudi Arabia and the U.S. against Iran, which backs proxy groups from Yemen to Syria and Lebanon. Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed credit for the attack, but U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran directly.\n\nThe Trump administration said it\u2019s ready to deploy the nation\u2019s emergency oil reserves and help stabilize markets if needed.\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability of Saudi infrastructure to attacks, historically seen as a stable source of crude to the market, is a new paradigm the market will need to deal with,\u201d said Virendra Chauhan, a Singapore-based analyst at industry consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. \u201cAt present, it is not known how long crude will be offline for.\u201d\n\nBrent jumped as much as 19.5%, it\u2019s biggest gain in percentage terms since 1991. It was up 12.7% at $67.85 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe at 6:33 a.m. in Singapore. West Texas Intermediate crude futures jumped as much as 15.5% in New York to $63.34, the most since 2008.\n\nOil sank 2.1% in London to $60.22 a barrel last week and 3% in New York to $54.85, amid concerns that slowing demand growth may augur another supply glut.\n\n--With assistance from Nayla Razzouk, Javier Blas, Anthony DiPaola, David Marino and James Thornhill.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Serene Cheong in Singapore at scheong20@bloomberg.net;Tina Davis in New York at tinadavis@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tina Davis at tinadavis@bloomberg.net, Alexander Kwiatkowski, Ramsey Al-Rikabi\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Brent crude surged the most on record after a drone strike on a Saudi Arabian oil facility removed about 5% of global supplies.The benchmark oil futures jumped as much as $11.73 a barrel to $71.95 as the market opened Monday in Asia, the biggest advance in dollar-terms since futures started", "authors": ["Serene Cheong", "Tina Davis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BSSYSIQZgEuPNb6E.n86eQ--~B/aD03MTA7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/b1a73f050ac629647885d86c4cb49dbd", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
