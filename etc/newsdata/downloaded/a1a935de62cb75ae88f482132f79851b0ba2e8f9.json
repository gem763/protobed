Here\u2019s her four-bedroom house in Glendale (Picture: James Keivom/Metro.co.uk)\n\nIn our weekly series What I Rent, we\u2019ve been taking you inside different people\u2019s rented properties around the UK, from London to Leith.\n\nWe want to take an honest look at the reality of renting \u2013 the good, the bad, and the wildly overpriced.\n\nThe main thing we\u2019ve learned is that London is expensive and looking at how much cheaper rent is up north makes us want to cry.\n\nBut what happens when we venture a little further away from the capital?\n\nWhat\u2019s it like to rent across the pond, in New York?\n\nHandily enough, this time we\u2019re chatting to someone who rents property in New York \u2013 taking What I Rent outside of the UK for the first time.\n\nUrszula is a 25-year-old social media manager, actor, fashion blogger, and influencer. She\u2019s originally from Greenpoint, Brooklyn, but now rents two (yes, two) properties \u2013 one in Glendale, Queens, and one in Bushwick, in Brooklyn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re going to be nosing around Urszula\u2019s rented four-bedroom house in Glendale.\n\nThe 25-year-old pays $1,000 a month for the house (Picture: James Keivom/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHi, Urszula! How much do you pay to live here?\n\nI pay $1,000 (\u00a3815)) a month for this place while I also rent another room in my apartment in Bushwick.\n\nI rent two places because Glendale is a bit far from the city commuting wise and since I go to events a lot and hang in Brooklyn too, I decided to get an apartment with roommates in Bushwick, Brooklyn. I\u2019m really close to public transportation and everything is more accessible.\n\nBills are usually no more than $60 a month for internet and electricity.\n\nHow many rooms are in this house?\n\nThe place has two floors, a yard and a garage. There are four bedrooms and one and a half bathrooms.\n\nDo you think you have a good deal?\n\nI do have a great deal! You will not find a big space like this for $3,000 in New York City. Renting apartments in New York City is expensive.\n\nThe house has two levels (Picture: James Keivom/Metro.co.uk)\n\nDo you like Glendale?\n\nI love Glendale, Queens because it\u2019s super quiet, clean, affordable, and definitely more suburban than my other place in Bushwick. I love to enjoy the peace and quiet.\n\nI\u2019ll often stay here more than in Bushwick because I feel like I can get away from city life while still being in the city. I get to work creatively, get things done more often and have more time to myself and privacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love the fact that it feels like I am in the suburbs. It\u2019s peaceful, clean and quiet. It feels like I\u2019m outside of the city.\n\nDo you feel like you have enough space?\n\nDefinitely! I have two floors and I am so happy for that! I have a lot of room. Since I have a lot of clothes and shoes, one of the rooms is a walk-in closet for me.\n\nHow did you find the house?\n\nI found this place through my parents. They were able to connect me.\n\nUrszula needs plenty of storage for her clothes (Picture: James Keivom/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWhat\u2019s it like living alone?\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful. I feel independent, responsible, and I have my own privacy.\n\nHow have you made this place feel like home?\n\nI grew organic tomatoes in the yard to make it feel more green. I\u2019m heavy into eating organic food.\n\nBringing my most valuable possessions like my camera, clothes, shoes etc, has made the apartment feel like I have everything I need and love close to me. It\u2019s all about the way you decorate!\n\nUrszula with the tomatoes she grew in the garden (Picture: James Keivom/Metro.co.uk)\n\nDo you have plans to move again?\n\nI do plan on moving. Since I currently do have two apartments, ideally I would prefer to move into one apartment in Manhattan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was thinking of moving sometime in December of this year, since apartments are cheaper during the winter season. I was thinking of moving to the Upper East Side.\n\nAnd what about buying a property? Have you considered buying a place?\n\nOf course! My parents actually bought a house so I\u2019m set!\n\nLucky. Shall we have a look around?\n\nThe entryway (Picture: James Keivom/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThe kitchen, dining, and living area (Picture: James Keivom/Metro.co.uk)\n\nNow that\u2019s a proper dining table (Picture: James Keivom/Metro.co.uk)\n\nYou can spy some family glassware in the cupboard (Picture: James Keivom/Metro.co.uk)\n\nPeek through the window and you can see the tomatoes in the garden (Picture: James Keivom/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThe garden (Picture: James Keivom/Metro.co.uk)\n\nComplete with a swinging bench (Picture: James Keivom/Metro.co.uk)\n\nFancy kitchen, right?
