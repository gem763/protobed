The interview will be her first appearance on TV news since NBCUniversal cut ties with her last October after she defended blackface.\n\nIt\u2019s also her first time back on the air at Fox since she left the network in 2017. While the return has led to some speculation that she may be in line to replace recently departed Fox host Shepard Smith, the network insists her appearance is a one-off. \u201c\u201cMegyn Kelly\u2019s forthcoming guest appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight was coordinated weeks ago and is a one-time occurrence,\u201d Fox said in a statement. \u201cAny future programming changes we are considering do not involve her.\u201d\n\nCarlson said he plans to interview Kelly about media bias related to her experiences at NBC News. As Variety notes, it\u2019s unclear whether or not Kelly is bound by any sort of non-disparagement agreement as part of her departure deal with the network.\n\nKelly recently tweeted about the rape allegation against former NBC Today host Matt Lauer in the wake of the revelations in Ronan Farrow\u2019s book, wondering how he was able to get away with it for so long.\n\nThe attacks being heaped on Brooke Nevils by ppl who have no clue how unchecked power can infect a workplace are deeply misguided. No sane person can think Lauer\u2019s behavior here-that to which he *admits*-was anything less than abhorrent. How was he able to get away w/it so long? \u2014 Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) October 10, 2019\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at Variety", "description": "Megyn Kelly will return to Fox for the first time since leaving in 2017 when she sits for an interview with Tucker Carlson on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Bonnie Stiernberg"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GettyImages-941101814-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
