But a video of him retelling it at an event in 2017, at the pool\u2019s dedication ceremony after it was renamed for him, resurfaced earlier this week.\n\nThe story raised eyebrows, especially in light of a series of inaccuracies that emerged from a story Mr Biden told last month about an incident in which he met a war hero in Afghanistan.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

When Corn Pop would not stop, he called him \u201cEsther\u201d, referring to the movie star Esther Williams, who was known for her aquatic dancing.\n\n\u201cCorn Pop was a bad dude,\u201d Mr Biden told the crowd in the video. He was reputed to be leader of a local gang called The Romans.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The world's best pools with a view Show all 11 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Mr Biden wrapped a chain around his wrist, but Corn Pop had a knife. To avoid a physical confrontation, Mr Biden apologised for calling him Esther Williams, thus, it appears, defusing the situation and reaching a satisfying moral conclusion about standing up for yourself but avoiding violence where possible.\n\nThe Washington Post previously reported that Corn Pop\u2019s real name was William Morris, and that his friends and family remember his relationship with Mr Biden, if not the specific pool incident.\n\nNow, Mr Morris\u2019s son, Leon Morris, wants people to know that his father wasn\u2019t really a knife-wielding villain.\n\nIn a series of tweets, CNN journalist Daniel Dale confirmed that the younger Mr Morris \u201csaid he has no problem at all with Biden telling the story from the 60s, but he doesn't want people to think of his dad as a bad guy based on something in the distant past\u201d.\n\nHe said his father was a \"good kindhearted man who would do anything for anybody. He was always polite and respectful to everyone, that\u2019s what he always taught me to be.\"\n\nMr Morris was born after the alleged pool incident, according to Mr Dale\u2019s tweets, but said that his relatives told him his father did talk about Mr Biden, referring to \"some type of run in or something with my dad\".", "description": "The saga of Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0mysterious story from the 1960s, in which he and a man called Corn Pop almost battled with a knife and a chain but ultimately did not, may have been confirmed.", "authors": ["Lily Puckett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/16/gettyimages-1168719261.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
