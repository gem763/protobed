Her friend, the songwriter and artist Allee Willis, called Olsen and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got the Wienermobile tomorrow,\u201d and asked if she wanted to tool around in it with her.\n\nWhy not? One thing led to another on their drive, and the famous Oscar Mayer promotional vehicle eventually ended up at the Brady house \u2014 so-called because it\u2019s the house originally seen in the exterior establishing shots of the TV show, which premiered 50 years ago this month. Tourists seem to always be there, taking selfies and lurking around.\n\n\u201cAllee says, to her dying day, she will never forget the look on all the tourists\u2019 faces,\u201d Olsen said, \u201cwhen the Wienermobile pulled up and Cindy Brady got out.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing Olsen tell that story to a roomful of rapt TV critics in July, I wished for an enormous, gilt-framed, realist painting of this wholly American moment: At the center of the painting is the house that is merely a false representation of what everybody believes it to be; to one side is the Weinermobile, a perfect melding of technology with mass-produced appetite; out of it emerges the one true Cindy; in the background are the faces of startled onlookers. And, maybe, while we\u2019re at it, we could add in the majestic presence of a 10-point buck, and George Washington, and palm trees against a pinky-blue California dusk.\n\nInstead I will settle for a home-renovation show.\n\nUnlike others in their boomer and Generation X cohort \u2014 who every day wage the epic family battle of what to do with Mom and Dad\u2019s old house and copious belongings, while split-level suburban ramblers are sold as teardowns and thrift stores bulge with unwanted yet meaningfully meaningless mid-century bric-a-brac \u2014 the original actors who played the six stepsiblings on the ultimate \u201970s sitcom \u201cThe Brady Bunch\u201d have returned to TV to perform this emotional ritual in reverse.\n\nOn the irresistibly nostalgic four-episode miniseries \u201cA Very Brady Renovation\u201d (premiering Monday on HGTV), the Brady kids reunite to assist some of the network\u2019s stars with a massive, six-month remodeling of the house. To put it back precisely as the audience perceived it. The original \u201cBrady Bunch\u201d ran for five seasons, followed by a permanent loop of reruns, revivals and remakes in the pop-culture consciousness. Those kid actors are now in their late 50s to mid-60s. (Imagine: Marcia on Medicare.) Robert Reed, who played their father, Mike Brady, died in 1992. Florence Henderson, who played their mother, Carol, died in 2016. Ann B. Davis, who played their beloved housekeeper, Alice, died in 2014.\n\nWithout having to explicitly say so, \u201cA Very Brady Renovation\u201d works as a curious form of closure, which is slightly more interesting than its more obvious acts of groovy restoration.\n\nCheerful and inviting as the show might be, its mission is to put everything back the way it was, the way Mom and Dad had it \u2014 a final attempt to see if we can Make Brady America Great Again, down to finding the right pattern for the tastefully garish living room sofa, or using 3-D printing technology to restore the horse statuette that sits on a credenza, or hunting for the correct finial knobs that go on the backs of the dining room chairs. A significant part of Monday\u2019s episode is spent debating whether it will be acceptable to rebuild the famous Brady stairway with 11 steps instead of 12.\n\nTo bring up the fact that none of it was ever real \u2014 that \u201cA Very Brady Renovation\u201d is indeed a costly and pointless attempt to put a layer of new fake on top of the old fake \u2014 is to look for logic where it need not exist. As the house comes together, the Brady cast\u2019s faces reflect an almost profound wonder at the passage of time. The show is covertly speaking to us about mortality. It tells us something about the surprising degree to which the past can be retrieved, to say nothing of the lengths that 21st-century TV producers will go to retrieve it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange kind of place between fiction and reality,\u201d says Christopher Knight (a.k.a. middle son Peter Brady), as he gazes around in the house/not-the-house in the first episode.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Brady Zone,\u201d Olsen adds.\n\n\n\nMuch was made of the house's availability when it went on the market in 2018, as-is, for the first time since 1973. (Asking price: $1.88 million.) The house has for years been a drive-by curiosity; the former owners' attempts at privacy included painting it pale pink and erecting a decorative, knee-high brick wall on the lawn's perimeter.\n\nStill, it is unmistakably the house. Hundreds of purchase offers poured in (including one from former boy-band singer Lance Bass), but HGTV prevailed, and set about recruiting the very Brady actors to participate in this very corny effort. Several of them, it turns out, were dutiful yuppies who became savvy real estate investors, gaining some hands-on renovation experience along the way.\n\nWith the help of a design chief, a contractor and a construction crew, a grand plan emerges to make the inside of the house conform precisely to \u201cThe Brady Bunch\u201d stage interiors \u2014 from the orange Formica in the kitchen to the Jack-and-Jill bathroom shared by the six kids, to the groovy attic that a teenage Greg Brady (Barry Williams) claimed for his own, to the resentment of his stepsister Marcia (Maureen McCormick).\n\nShepherded by HGTV\u2019s favorite camera hogs, \u201cThe Property Brothers\u201d (Jonathan and Drew Scott), and with help from the stars of \u201cRestored by the Fords,\u201d \u201cHidden Potential,\u201d \u201cFlea Market Flip\u201d and \u201cGood Bones,\u201d the project involves turning the one-story house into a two-story house, to add some 2,000 square feet of new living space without changing the essential street view.\n\n\u201cJust know that if any of this is wrong, we\u2019ll be put out to dry,\u201d Drew Scott warns his HGTV colleagues. \u201cAll of America will know exactly what this house is supposed to look like.\u201d\n\nIn fact, all of America pitched in: The hunt for vintage furnishings became an online group effort, with collectors proudly volunteering their wares \u2014 down to the decorative plastic grapes on a coffee table and a curio cabinet that stands between the dining room and kitchen. Other treasures were unearthed in deep storage at Paramount.\n\nAnd what becomes of the house, once finished? Turning it into a museum won\u2019t work for the neighborhood, which has suffered enough Brady mania. HGTV is giving away a week\u2019s stay at the house as part of a promotional contest, but beyond that, the network\u2019s plans for the property are unknown.\n\nA more interesting question is what becomes of the people. At HGTV\u2019s news conference and a \u201970s-themed cocktail party in Beverly Hills \u2014 at which guests could have their picture taken and inserted into the center \u201cAlice\u201d spot on a souvenir 3-by-3 \u201cBrady Bunch\u201d grid \u2014 the actors seemed particularly comfortable, mingling cheerfully in the crowd. There is no question or joke or heartfelt sentiment that they have not heard before.\n\nMany of them worked hard to get beyond Bradyness, others used it for what it was. To some degree \u2014 remarkable amid known cases of child-actor syndrome \u2014 they mostly stayed out of headlines. They stayed out of prison. They stayed alive. They kept working, some in other fields. Mike Lookinland, who played Bobby Brady, has spent the past 14 years running a company that makes concrete countertops. When the group agrees to take a professional Brady gig, he said he has to call Williams or Knight and ask if he can borrow their agent.\n\nWhile \u201cA Very Brady Renovation\u201d succeeds as a metaphorical exercise in the ersatz, the real fascination lies in that other story, about six people who spent their lives being Brady and Not Brady, and the preservation of one\u2019s truest self.\n\nA Very Brady Renovation (90 minutes) premieres Monday at 9 p.m. on HGTV.", "description": "With help from the Property Brothers, the trick is to make this old house look as fake as the fake one did.", "authors": ["Hank Stuever", "Tv Critic"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/67VVMXWQCUI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
