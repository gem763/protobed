Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility for the attack although fingers are being pointed elsewhere as tensions between the U.S. and Iran hit new levels.\n\nThe attack was as severe as it was unexpected but that\u2019s not the worst thing about it. Saudi Arabia believes a significant proportion of the outages can be back online in a few days while Trump also approved release of supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ensure the market remains well surprised.\n\nNone of this should make us feel relaxed about the potential for further attacks though and the longer-term implications on the oil market. Spikes in oil prices when the global economy is already flirting with the idea of recession is not ideal and, if repeated and sustained, could ultimately be what tips us over the edge.\n\nWhile oil prices have pared gains following the initial knee-jerk reaction to the reports, and WTI remain around 10% higher as the geopolitical risk premium keeps prices elevated. This may settle down if attacks are not repeated but traders may be a little on edge for a while, keeping oil trading at a premium for some time.\n\nGold vulnerable despite safe haven flows\n\nNeedless to say, the markets are very much in risk-off territory at the start of the week. As you\u2019d expect, the normal safe haven\u2019s are having a lovely time of it, has found its mojo again, the and Swiss are back in favour and European and U.S. futures are lower ahead of the open. is also higher but let\u2019s face it, that moves independently of everything else no matter what some would like to believe.\n\nGold is very interesting though as the safe haven flows took us back above $1,500 and shielded the crucial $1,480 support. That said, it still remains some way from its recent peak and therefore still vulnerable.\n\nGold Daily Chart\n\nGold Daily Chart\n\nBoris heads to Luxembourg\n\nBrexit may have some competition for the front pages this morning but it\u2019s going to be putting up a fight here in the UK, just as many will be hoping Johnson will be doing during his visit to Luxembourg. The PM will meet Jean-Claude Juncker as he hopes to convince the outgoing European Commission President of the credibility of his plan to replace the backstop.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve heard broad statements about what the plan will involve, Johnson\u2019s will need to have all the i\u2019s dotted and t\u2019s crossed if he wants to convince the European\u2019s and few believe he will or, in some cases, even wants to. Sterling volatility is going nowhere.\n\nDaily Chart\n\nGBPUSD Daily Chart\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by MarketPulse (Craig Erlam) covering: GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, XAU/USD.
