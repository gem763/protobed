Kelce had three catches for 88 yards, but\u2014much to the chagrin of some fantasy players\u2014didn't find the end zone despite being wide open on the play in question.\n\nThe Chiefs' signal-caller unleashed the no-look pass last season on his way to the league MVP in his first year as a full-time starter, but he surely learned a valuable lesson against the Jaguars.\n\nSometimes simple does the trick.", "description": "Kansas City Chiefs  quarterback Patrick Mahomes dazzled in his team's 40-26 season-opening win over the  Jacksonville Jaguars  on Sunday, but he missed a throw to tight end  Travis Kelce  that should have been a straightforward touchdown...", "authors": ["Scott Polacek"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/827/196/hi-res-d5abcb3187039205a9cc6667e99048b1_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
