Makharadze was initially released due to his diplomatic status, before the US asked the Georgian government to waive his immunity.\n\nThe former Soviet state agreed, and Makharadze appeared before a court in Washington nine months later where he pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. He served five years in prison. Mrs Wagner, a teacher, said she only got justice because she kept her daughter\u2019s name in the public consciousness. She said: \u2018It wasn\u2019t that the United States was on my side or demanded the lifting of diplomatic immunity for the man who killed my daughter.\n\nMakharadze, Georgia\u2019s deputy ambassador in the US (pictured in a white shirt), pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter nine months after the crash and served five years in prison. He was initially granted diplomatic immunity. But Waltrick's mother Viviane Wagner says he only faced justice 'purely because [she] never gave up' and stood at the place where the accident occurred every day for nine months\n\nMs Wagner says she 'would love to meet (Harry's mother Charlotte Graham, pictured after meeting with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab yesterday) and stand with her in this fight\u2019 for justice\n\n\u2018He faced justice purely because I never gave up, I made sure that nobody could forget what happened to Jovi. Every day for nine months I went to the place where the accident occurred, and I stayed there the whole day, with banners and placards, distributing leaflets telling people what had happened to my daughter.\u2019\n\nMrs Wagner, 57, said the US only asked Georgia to lift Makharadze\u2019s diplomatic immunity after negative media stories emerged about the case. She said watching the anguish of Harry\u2019s family has made her feel more must be done to ensure diplomatic immunity is not abused.\n\n\u2018Harry\u2019s mother is in the midst of her mourning, her hurting heart more than she can bear, but she must find the strength to keep fighting to make sure no one forgets, and that justice is done,\u2019 Mrs Wagner said. \u2018My heart is together with hers. I would love to meet her and stand with her in this fight.\u2019\n\nThe cases faces similarities to the death of Harry Dunn (pictured right), who was killed in a motorbike accident involving suspect Anne Sacoolas (pictured left). Ms Wagner has told his family to 'find the strength so no one forgets\u2019 just as she went to the scene of her daughter's death with banners and placards, distributing leaflets telling people what had happened\n\nMrs Wagner, who has two adult sons and now lives in her native Brazil, added: \u2018If I have any advice to give to the parents of Harry Dunn, it is to keep fighting until justice is done.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018I know something of the pain they are going through. They have to be strong, and fight for justice and never give up.\u2019", "description": "Viviane Wagner, mother of Joviane Waltrick who was killed when\u00a0Gueorgui Makharadze sped through a red light in 1997, has told Harry Dunn's parents to 'find strength so no one forgets' in a 'similar case'", "authors": ["Mail Foreign Service"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19556822-0-image-a-27_1570738695874.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
