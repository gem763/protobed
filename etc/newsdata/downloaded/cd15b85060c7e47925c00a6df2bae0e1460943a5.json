(Members of Congress cannot be impeached.)\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLate last night, President Trump took to Twitter to spew personal attacks at me,\u201d Pelosi said in the solicitation. \u201cWell, I have news for him: All he\u2019s done is make me more determined than ever to keep fighting to reveal the truth about his abuses of power.

Esper and Office of Management and Budget acting director Russell Vought for documents related to the withholding of U.S. military aid from Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Committees are investigating the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding military assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression, as well as any efforts to cover up these matters,\u201d the lawmakers said in a letter.\n\nSigning the letter were Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), Oversight Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot L.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told a reporter Friday. \u201cLike I said, he plays it like a violin, and everybody falls right into it. It\u2019s not a real request.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans recycle defense that Trump was joking about China investigating the Bidens\n\nRep.

He made a stop in Arizona on Thursday, touting the USMCA at a Caterpillar facility in Green Valley. In a Wednesday tweet about the visit, he said the White House is ready to move forward with the deal \u201cwhenever the Democrats in Congress are done with Presidential harassment.\u201d\n\nIn his op-ed, Pence urged lawmakers to \u201cput partisanship aside\u201d and support the USMCA.\n\n\u201cThe USMCA is an idea whose time has come,\u201d the op-ed said. \u201cLet\u2019s put partisanship aside, put American jobs and American workers first, and give our economy a boost by passing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\u201d\n\nPence is scheduled to make another appearance later Monday in Nashville to promote the USMCA.\n\n10 a.m.: Pelosi highlights concerns of Founding Fathers about foreign election interference\n\nPelosi shared an article on Twitter on Monday highlighting concerns that the nation\u2019s founders had with foreign election interference.\n\nJordan E. Taylor, at Smith College, wrote that Pelosi, in a letter last week to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), pointed out that \u201cour Founders were specifically intent on ensuring that foreign entities did not undermine the integrity of our elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cPelosi is right,\u201d Taylor continued. \u201cThe first generation of American political leaders understood the danger of foreign involvement in their elections because they lived through it. Throughout the 1790s, France\u2019s ambassadors repeatedly sought to influence the results of American elections, hoping to sway policy in their favor. Even after this meddling ended, fear of foreign influence persisted, ultimately making subsequent untainted elections seem illegitimate.\u201d\n\n9 a.m.: State Department official does not appear at scheduled deposition\n\nGeorge Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state in the European and Eurasian Bureau, did not appear for a deposition before three House committees scheduled for Monday morning.\n\n\u201cNo, Democrats originally scheduled him for deposition today, but his appearance has not yet been worked out or confirmed,\u201d said a person familiar with the planned deposition who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nLast week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo balked at the timing of several planned depositions of State Department officials, saying House Democrats were not giving them adequate time to prepare.\n\nHouse investigators are planning to hear Tuesday from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who has become a central figure in the probe, and Friday from Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from the post early.\n\nDiscussions remain ongoing with other State Department officials, a Democratic aide said.\n\n\u2014 reporting by John Hudson\n\n8:05 a.m.: Trump again accuses whistleblower of being partisan\n\nIn Monday morning tweets, Trump again accused the anonymous whistleblower of being \u201cpartisan\u201d without citing evidence and claimed the whistleblower was \u201cvery wrong\u201d about Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIn fact, the whistleblower\u2019s complaint closely tracks a rough transcript of the call released by the White House.\n\nTrump also referred to reports of multiple whistleblowers, writing, \u201cBring in another Whistleblower from the bench!\u201d\n\n6:45 a.m.: Republicans step up attacks on Pelosi\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel attacked Pelosi in an early morning tweet, echoing Trump and other leading members of the GOP who have upped their efforts to tear down the House speaker.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi isn\u2019t interested in the truth,\u201d McDaniel tweeted. \u201cShe is only out to destroy @realDonaldTrump \u2014 and the American people see right through it!\u201d\n\nMcDaniel included a link in her tweet to an opinion piece by former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) published by Fox News over the weekend. In it, he argued that Pelosi and House Democrats are \u201ccreating a rigged game that sets up a coup to destroy the president.\u201d\n\nGiuliani also went on Twitter early Monday morning, resurrecting his idea of filing a lawsuit against Pelosi for \u201cconspiracy to violate constitutional and civil rights.\u201d\n\n6:30 a.m.: Dozens of national security officials applauding whistleblower\n\nA group of 90 former national security officials who served under presidents of both parties released an open letter on Sunday applauding the original whistleblower in the Ukraine controversy and calling on the government and media to protect his identity.\n\n\u201cA responsible whistleblower makes all Americans safer by ensuring that serious wrongdoing can be investigated and addressed, thus advancing the cause of national security to which we have devoted our careers,\u201d the letter says. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, being a responsible whistleblower means that, by law, one is protected from certain egregious forms of retaliation. Whatever one\u2019s view of the matters discussed in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, all Americans should be united in demanding that all branches of our government and all outlets of our media protect this whistleblower and his or her identity.\u201d\n\nThose signing the letter, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, include former CIA director John Brennan, former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. and former defense secretary Chuck Hagel.\n\n6:15 a.m.: Colin Powell: \u2018The Republican Party has got to get a grip on itself\u2019\n\nAs many GOP lawmakers continue to defend Trump amid an expanding impeachment inquiry, Colin Powell, the retired general who served under three Republican presidents, said the party \u201chas got to get a grip on itself.\u201d\n\nIn remarks broadcast Sunday on CNN, Powell criticized Republican members of Congress for staying silent as Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure a foreign power to target a political rival were exposed.\n\nRepublican leaders, Powell said, \u201care holding back because they\u2019re terrified of what will happen to any one of them if they speak out.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWhen they see things that are not right, they need to say something about it, because our foreign policy is in shambles right now.\u201d\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Deanna Paul\n\n6 a.m.: Trump suggests Pelosi, Schiff committed \u2018Treason,\u2019 should be impeached\n\nSince Democrats began an impeachment inquiry, Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the House Intelligence Committee chairman, by accusing him of treason and demanding that he be removed from office.\n\nOn Sunday night, Trump repeated those claims on Twitter \u2014 and this time, suggested that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is also guilty of \u201cHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason,\u201d while insisting that both Democratic leaders should be impeached.\n\nMembers of Congress cannot be impeached. The Constitution gives the House or Senate the power to expel one of its own members by a two-thirds vote.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi knew all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con, and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 & lawyer,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Tim Elfrink", "description": "After saying the House speaker should be impeached on Sunday night, Trump asserts again Monday that his call with the leader of Ukraine had been perfect.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter", "Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DfNqL9ZZnFo5zW_BDeFAn1ryoz8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W5P42MHI7UI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
