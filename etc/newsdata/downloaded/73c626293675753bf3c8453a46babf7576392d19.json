And this would generate more data about them, which in turn could make them more likely to be flagged as a risk.\n\nMatters could worsen over time, another officer said, when software was used to predict future crime hotspots.\n\n\"We pile loads of resources into a certain area and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, purely because there's more policing going into that area, not necessarily because of discrimination on the part of officers,\" the interviewee said.\n\nThere was disagreement, however, on how much scope should be given to officers wanting to ignore predictive software's recommendations.\n\n\"Officers often disagree with the algorithm,\" said one.\n\n\"I'd expect and welcome that challenge. The point where you don't get that challenge, that's when people are putting that professional judgement aside.\"\n\nBut another officer worried about others being too willing to ignore an app's recommendations, adding: \"Professional judgement might just be another word for bias.\"\n\n'Patchwork quilt'\n\nMr Babuta said this problem could be addressed.\n\n\"There are ways that you can scan and analyse the data for bias and then eliminate it,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"[And] there are police forces that are exploring the opportunities of these new types of data analytics for actually eliminating bias in their own data sets.\"\n\nBut he added that \"we need clearer processes to ensure that those safeguards are applied consistently\".\n\nIn the meantime, one officer described the current landscape as being like \"a patchwork quilt - uncoordinated and delivered to different settings and for different outcomes\".\n\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council has responded saying UK police always seek to strike a balance between keeping people safe and protecting their rights.\n\n\"For many years police forces have looked to be innovative in their use of technology to protect the public and prevent harm and we continue to explore new approaches to achieve these aims,\" Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Drake said.\n\n\"But our values mean we police by consent, so anytime we use new technology we consult with interested parties to ensure any new tactics are fair, ethical and producing the best results for the public.\"", "description": "Law enforcers fear they will be told to unfairly target some groups because of past prejudices.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DF87/production/_108832275_ba480e98-e3e6-4695-857d-8af170943689.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
