A day after Extinction Rebellion protestors were ordered to stop demonstrating in London, the five-time world champion wrote a series of laments \u2013 all of which he later deleted \u2013 about environmental destruction.\n\nWhile Hamilton is on the cusp of sealing his sixth Formula One championship, it is the danger of global ecological disaster that has been preoccupying him most of late. \u201cHonestly, I feel like giving up on everything,\u201d he told his 13.1 million followers. \u201cShut down completely. Why bother when the world is such a mess and people don\u2019t seem to care? I\u2019m going to take a moment away to gather my thoughts. Thank you to those of you who do give a damn about the world.\u201d\n\nHamilton has recently embraced veganism and last month opened his own Neat Burger restaurant in central London, using only plant-based products. \u201cExtinction of our race is becoming more and more likely as we overuse our resources,\u201d he said. \u201cAgriculture farming is the largest pollutant we currently have by over 50 per cent, far more than our travel industry combined. I\u2019m sad to see so many people, even close friends, ignore what is happening daily.", "description": "Lewis Hamilton sparked worries for his mental wellbeing after posting an Instagram message where he claimed he \u201cfelt like giving up on everything\u201d.", "authors": ["Oliver Brown", "Chief Sports Feature Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/formula-1/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000213125297-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
