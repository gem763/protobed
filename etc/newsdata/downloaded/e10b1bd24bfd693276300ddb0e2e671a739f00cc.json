He was arrested in 2015 while vacationing in Israel after Israeli authorities received an Interpol red notice.\n\nThe U.S. accused Borkov of hacking credit card databases of U.S. citizens and sharing those credit card details with other hackers.\n\nAfter Borkov's arrest in 2015 Israel's then-justice minister, Ayelet Shaked, signed an order to extradite him to the U.S.\n\nBefore the extradition could be carried out under Israeli law, a court review was required, followed by a second order from the justice ministry.\n\nRussia asked Israel several times to release Borkov, but Israeli officials told them to wait for the court's decision.\n\nIssachar, a dual Israeli-U.S. national, was transiting through Moscow's airport several months ago on her way back to Israel from India.\n\nCustoms officials found 9 grams of marijuana in her suitcase, and she was arrested for drug possession. Several weeks later, the charges were increased to attempted drug smuggling.\n\nShortly after Issachar\u2019s arrest, the Russians started raising her case in connection to Borkov's. That's according to Israeli officials who say Israel concluded Russia's intelligence and security services were driving the effort.\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nAt some point over the summer, the Russians formally proposed the prisoner swap, Israeli officials say. The Israelis rejected it for two reasons:\n\nFirst, it would be very hard to approve such a deal legally.\n\nSecond, they didn\u2019t want to reject a U.S. extradition request tied to alleged Russian cyber crimes.\n\nIn late August, the Israeli supreme court approved Borkov\u2019s extradition to the U.S.\n\nTwo weeks later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi.\n\nThe proposed Russian deal was discussed, the Israeli officials say, and Netanyahu stressed to Putin that the punishment sought by Russian prosecutors for Issachar was disproportionate.\n\nNetanyahu stressed to Putin that even if he wanted to make such a deal, the supreme court's ruling made it impossible.\n\nThe latest: Netanyahu and Putin discussed the issue again on a phone call earlier this week, but no progress was made.\n\nWhat they're saying: After the Russian court verdict, the Israeli foreign ministry issued a harsh statement:\n\n\"Israel gravely views the verdict given today in Russia concerning Israeli citizen Naama Issachar. This is a substantial & disproportionate punishment for a young Israeli with no criminal record, who arrived in Moscow with the intention of catching a connecting flight on her way home to Israel. Unfortunately, Russian authorities have not as yet heeded our requests to conduct the case appropriately in accordance to the circumstances of her arrest.\"\n\nNetanyahu tried to cool down the crisis and after the verdict, he issued a second statement stressing his appreciation of Putin's efforts on the matter and added he hopes a solution will be found.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been corrected to reflect that the U.S. did not accuse Alexei Borkov of hacking American banks and demand his extradition. The U.S. accused Borkov of hacking credit card databases of U.S. citizens and sharing those details with other hackers.", "description": "Naama Issachar was sentenced to 7+ years on drug charges", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/i07hMDm93qqDqYrb7R7QXccfg0k=/0x0:1067x600/1920x1080/2019/10/11/1570806656117.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
