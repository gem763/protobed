Special Envoy told Reuters on Thursday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.N. Special Envoy Geir Pedersen attends a news conference at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland October 2, 2019. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\n\nGeir Pedersen said that envoys from 7 Arab and Western states backing the opposition, known as the \u201csmall group\u201d, which includes the United States, are due to meet in the Swiss city on Friday.\n\nSenior officials from the so-called Astana three - Russia, Iran and Turkey - were expected in coming days, but he awaited confirmation.\n\nThe major powers would not participate directly in the \u201cSyrian-owned, Syrian-led\u201d constitutional effort, or the opening public ceremony, but they supported the process, he said.\n\nTalks are on track despite Turkey\u2019s cross-border offensive launched on Oct. 9 after President Donald Trump ordered U.S. forces out of northeast Syria. Turkey and Russia, the Assad government\u2019s main ally, have agreed a peace plan calling for Kurdish forces to withdraw more than 30 km (20 miles) from the Turkish border.\n\n\u201cIt seems that by and large that the ceasefire is holding.\n\nThat of course doesn\u2019t mean that there will not be challenges,\u201d Pedersen said in an interview in his U.N. office.\n\nHe had reports that some of the 160,000 people who fled the incursion are starting to return to their homes.\n\nConvening the Constitutional Committee, the first tangible progress since the Norwegian diplomat took up the U.N. job in January, is seen as key to paving the way for political reforms and new elections in the country wracked by 8 years of war that have killed hundreds of thousands and forced millions to flee.\n\n\u201cNo one believes that the Constitutional Committee in itself will solve the conflict. But if it is understood as part of a broader political process, it could be a door-opener and a very important of course symbolic beginning of a political process,\u201d Pedersen said.\n\n\u201cHEAVY RESPONSIBILITY\u201d\n\nAn agreement was reached under which the Assad government, the Syrian opposition and civil society each submitted 50 members to serve on the panel. Each delegation includes Kurds, but there is no SDF or YPG representation, he said.\n\nA group of 45 is to start drafting a document.\n\n\u201cI believe it is a historic occasion and of course for 150 Syrians to meet and to discuss a new Constitutional arrangement for their own country, that\u2019s a heavy responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the end they will decide what kind of Constitution, or constitutional reform, will be necessary for Syria,\u201d he added.\n\nPedersen said that the two co-chairs were Ahmad Kuzbari for the Syrian government and Hadi AlBahra for the opposition.\n\n\u201cI think both the Astana 3 and the \u2018Small Group\u2019 will hopefully express their continued full support to the constitutional process and the broader political process,\u201d he said.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has held talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem in Damascus and SNC opposition figures in Riyadh on the new constitutional panel, and on prisoner releases to build confidence.\n\nEach side has freed some 50 prisoners in four simultaneous releases over the past year, he said, adding: \u201cMy appeal to both sides has been to have more substantial releases\u201d.", "description": "A ceasefire in northeast Syria seems to be holding \"by and large\", as major powers gather in Geneva ahead of the first meeting of Syria's Constitutional Committee next week, the U.N.
