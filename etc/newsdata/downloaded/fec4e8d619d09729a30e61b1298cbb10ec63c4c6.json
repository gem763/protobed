The XR falls between the top-of-the-line XS models in size, but is lower in price.\n\nBased on several days of testing, it looks like Apple made the right cost-cutting trade-offs with the XR, which starts selling Friday for about $750.\n\nThe standard XS starts at about $1,000; its supersized cousin, the XS Max, goes for $100 more.\n\nThe XR falls between the XS and the Max in size.\n\nWHAT THE REVIEWS SAY New York Times: The iPhone XR's 6.1-inch Super Retina LCD is one of the brighter and more colorful smartphone displays out there. It's just not OLED-great. The Verge: The display on the iPhone XR is\u2026 fine. It's fine! TechCrunch: Yes, the portrait mode works. No, it's not as good as the iPhone XS. Yes, I miss having a zoom lens. All of those things are true and easily the biggest reason I won\u2019t be buying an iPhone XR. Wall Street Journal: The XR has the longest battery life of any iPhone I've tested in recent memory. On paper, the XS is a more premium product than the XR, but I don't know who I would recommend the XS to. CNBC: I think the iPhone XR is the iPhone that most people should buy. It gives you the best bang for your buck.\n\nIts screen is about 7 percent larger than the XS and 12 percent smaller than the Max.\n\nBut the XR is closer in width to larger Phones such as the Max and older Plus models, so anyone upgrading from an iPhone 7 or 8 will have to get used to a new grip.\n\nAs with the XS, the XR's display extends close to the phone's edges, translating to 45 percent more screen space than the iPhone 8 and 6 percent more than the 8 Plus.\n\nThe XR and the XS both use facial recognition to unlock the phone, and both have a notch at the top for sensors, similar to shades on a car's windshield. The notch will take getting used to.\n\nThe most affordable handset in Apple\u2019s new line-up, the iPhone XR.

The screens on both XS models have better contrast and more vibrant colors than the standard LCD screen on the XR.\n\niPhone XR vs iPhone XS vs XS Max Screen Size: Display Type: Processor: Water Resistance: Battery Life: Fast Charge: Wireless Charge: 3D Touch Display: Dual Cameras: Optical Zoom: FaceID: Weight: Software: Price: Colours: iPhone XR 6.1-inch LCD A12 Bionic IP67 Up to 15 hours Yes Yes No No No Yes 194g (6.84 oz) iOS 12 $749 (\u00a3749) Yellow, White, Coral, Black, Blue, and Product Red iPhone XS 5.8-inch OLED A12 Bionic IP68 Up to 12 hours Yes Yes Yes Dual 12MP Lens Yes. 2x Yes 177g (6.24oz) iOS 12 $999 (\u00a3999) Gold, Space Grey, Silver iPhone XS Max 6.5-inch OLED A12 Bionic IP68 Up to 13 hours Yes Yes Yes Dual 12MP Lens Yes. 2x Yes 208g (7.34 oz) iOS 12 $1099 (\u00a31099) Gold, Space Grey, Silver\n\nAutumn leaves in the cartoon 'The Secret Lives of Pets' stand out more, while greater hints of orange appeared in a space drama's rocket exhaust flames.\n\nWhites are whiter, making the screen appear brighter even though it's not.\n\nThis Monday, Oct. 22, 2018, photo shows the iPhone XR, left, that has a single lens, and the iPhone XS Max that has two lenses, in New York.

Apple says that with LCD screens, higher resolution drains the battery faster, a trade-off that's minimal with the XS because its screen doesn't need a backlight.\n\nThat said, the differences are often hard to spot, even with the phones side by side. Where quality really matters, you'll probably want a bigger screen such as a tablet or a TV anyway.\n\nAlthough the Max has the largest battery in an iPhone, the XR was typically on par with or exceeded the Max in battery performance when viewing video, at least at lower or medium brightness. In any case, either phone should give you enough battery life for routine use.\n\nThis Monday, Oct. 22, 2018, photo shows from left the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and the iPhone XR in New York.

For many shots, the new iPhones blend four exposures rather than two, allowing for better lighting balance and more detail.\n\nIn some shots taken in suboptimal conditions - against direct sunlight - the XR still showed trees in dimly lit areas, while last year's iPhone X produced pitch back. The new cameras also have better focus and low-light capabilities.\n\nWhat's missing in the XR is a second rear lens for double the magnification. Instead, the XR uses software zoom, which reduces quality.\n\nPhilip W. Schiller, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Marketing of Apple, speaks about the new Apple iPhone XR at an Apple Inc product launch event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino\n\nOf course, the standard iPhone 7 and 8 didn't have a second lens either, although their Plus models did, as did the iPhone X.\n\nBoth XS models also have two lenses. Despite lacking a second lens, the XR lets you blur backgrounds in some shots, a feature many phones are now getting. The XR does this with software, though it works only with people in the foreground, while the XS can do statues and monuments.\n\nTwo more points of comparison. The XS has slightly better water resistance - good to a depth of 2 meters (2.2 yards), compared with just 1 meter on the XR. But the XR offers a budget storage-upgrade option: $50 for 128 gigabytes (up from 64 gigabytes in the base model).\n\nBoth XS phones also start at 64 gigabytes, but their cheapest upgrade is $150 for 256 gigabytes.\n\nThe only knock is the XR's size. Though it's fine for people with adequate pockets or bags, not everyone wants a phone that's nearly as wide as the Max or the Plus. Perhaps Apple will one day design a smaller XR and revive a trend of offering both standard and larger versions for each major model.", "description": "On one hand, the XR lacks the high-resolution screen and dual-lens camera on the XS. but it is  $250 cheaper and still get most of the other cutting-edge features found on the more expensive model.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/23/18/5331710-0-image-a-6_1540317149853.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-23"}
