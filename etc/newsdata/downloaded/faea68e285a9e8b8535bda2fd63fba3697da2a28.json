Long hair, short hair, no hair, they're all in that locker room together,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cTeams all over this country are the purest form of humanity that we have. We don't judge, we embrace differences. We live. We learn. We grow. We support and we defend each other. We're a family.\u201d\n\nFranklin then went on to describe Sutherland\u2019s character and achievements on and off the field.\n\nTENNESSEE VOLUNTEERS DISMISS JEREMY BANKS AFTER VIDEO OF SECOND INCIDENT SURFACES\n\n\u201cHe's the ultimate example of what our program is all about,\u201d he said. \u201cHe's a captain, he's a Dean List honor student. He's articulate. He's confident. He's intelligent. He's thoughtful. He's caring, and he's committed. He's got two of the most supportive parents, and I would be so blessed if my daughters would marry someone like him with his character and integrity one day.\u201d\n\nSutherland also offered a statement on the letter.\n\n\u201cAlthough the message was indeed rude, ignorant, and judging, I've taken no personal offense to it because personally, I must respect (him) as a person before I respect your opinion,\u201d Sutherland wrote in a statement posted onto his Twitter account. \u201cAt the end of the day, without an apology needed, I forgive this individual because I'm nowhere close to being perfect and I expect God to forgive me for all the wrong I've done in my life.\u201d\n\nDave Peterson, who signed the letter, told the Tribune-Democrat that he didn\u2019t intend his letter to be a cultural or racial statement.\n\nSutherland\u2019s teammates Antonio Shelton and C.J. Holmes denounced the letter on Twitter on Tuesday.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nPenn State is 5-0 this season and is set to take on Iowa on Saturday.", "description": "Penn State football head coach James Franklin on Tuesday gave a strong defense of one of his players after a scathing letter criticized the hairstyle of the\u00a0Nittany Lions\u2019 defensive back.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
