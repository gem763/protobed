'It's an unbelievable feeling. it was amazing to get through to the semis. Standing here now and we're in the final. I thank God. Thank God.'\n\nReligion has never been far from Tuilagi's side. In Samoa, his surname translates to the Son of Earth and High Heavens. His Christian name, meanwhile, translates to Fearless Warrior.\n\nThere was a time when Tuilagi thought that he would never play rugby again\n\nWith his baby daughter, Leilani, he is a regular at a Roman Catholic church in Leicester on Sunday mornings.\n\nOnly his wildest hopes and prayers would be to run out in a World Cup final. He also pinned his faith on a spiritual doctor in Samoa, who helped chase away 'evil lady spirits' to overcome years' worth of injuries.\n\nThere were days when he would strap himself up to hide away from the glare of medical staff, who were all too often the bearers of bad news. But from the moment England stood up here and enveloped the haka, Tuilagi ripped in and set the tone with the very first carry of the game. All those hours on the medical bed were banished to the past.\n\nTuilagi struggled with injuries but he is now thriving and is eager to win the World Cup\n\nHe was mobbed by team-mates when he won a key turnover on the stroke of half-time \u2014 and barely had the energy to stand by the time he was subbed after 74 minutes.\n\n'I was just trying to hang on, hang in there,' he said, his mantra 'when it gets tough'.\n\nHe added: 'We just keep focused and carry on, get your second wind and that way you get through it. Against the All Blacks, it's never done until the final whistle. It doesn't matter how many points you're ahead, you can never take your foot off the gas. We gave it everything we've got.'", "description": "NIK SIMON IN YOKOHAMA: When Manu Tuilagi walked off the pitch, having strained every sinew in his body, he clasped his hands in prayer and looked up at the night sky.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/22/20227312-0-image-a-87_1572126511672.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
