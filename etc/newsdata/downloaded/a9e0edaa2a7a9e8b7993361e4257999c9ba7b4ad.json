(Yui Mok/AP)\n\nOwen Carey was finally 18, and a London burger joint on the River Thames seemed like a great place to celebrate.\n\nThe teenager opted for a grilled chicken breast. Just to be safe, Carey alerted staff at the branch of the Byron restaurant chain about his dairy allergy. It appeared he was satisfied with what he was told, and after ordering from a menu that made no mention of it, dug into a meal that had been marinated in buttermilk.\n\nHe got through a few bites. Then, his lips tingled. His stomach churned. After leaving the restaurant, he collapsed near the London Eye less than an hour later, the BBC reported. He later died in a hospital.\n\nThe 2017 incident sparked sadness and outrage among Carey\u2019s family members, who searched for answers about how his death could have happened.\n\nOn Friday, they received an answer at the Southwark Coroner\u2019s Court.\n\nCarey died of severe, food-induced anaphylaxis, \u201cdespite making staff aware of his allergies,\u201d wrote coroner Briony Ballard in a statement read aloud in court, the British Press Association reported.\n\n\u201cThe menu was reassuring in that it made no reference to any marinade or potential allergenic ingredient in the food selected,\u201d and Carey \u201cwas not informed that there were allergens in the order,\u201d Ballard wrote.\n\n\u201cOwen was the shining light in our family, and his death should not have happened,\u201d his sister Emma Carey said outside court.\n\n[The autistic children of Donor H898]\n\nCarey family members said Carey\u2019s death, and the inquest revelation, should prompt new laws that make allergen labeling in restaurants more prominent and detailed. Discussions with staff in noisy restaurants with young staff members do not suffice, they said.\n\n\u201cThis leaves far too much room for error on an issue we know far too well can cost lives,\u201d Emma Carey said.\n\nByron chief executive Simon Wilkinson said in a statement after the inquest that his restaurants \u201chave robust procedures\u201d to deal with patrons with allergies but did not defend the circumstances that led to Carey\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of great regret and sadness that our high standards of communicating with our customers were not met during Owen\u2019s visit,\u201d Wilkinson said Friday.\n\nClodagh Bradley, an attorney for the family, said during the inquest that the menu\u2019s allergy information was printed \u201cat the very bottom, in a really very small font, in black print, on a royal blue background,\u201d the BBC reported.\n\nIn a response to the BBC, Byron representative Aimee Leitner-Hopps said, \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly legible in my opinion,\u201d and \u201cthe expectation is that a customer with an allergy should inform us.\u201d The corner said Carey did, in fact, inform the staff about his allergy.\n\nByron\u2019s online menu now makes reference to the buttermilk marinade for chicken and includes information about allergens.\n\nIt also includes a disclaimer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do our very best to accommodate you but we cannot guarantee that our kitchens or our suppliers are 100% allergen-free,\u201d the menu reads.
