I mean, quite literally. It's going everywhere. So, you know, that's not happening. The pump is with me. It's fine.\"\n\n(Image: Corbis via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty Images for Chanel)\n\nPreviously, the mum of two was widely praised for her openness about the mental health impacts of motherhood.\n\nChatting with The Guardian , she explained: \"Your body just created life and now it's shifting in order to feed it.\n\n\"That's monumental and we're all expected to go, 'Oh no, all good, I'm groovy - I haven't slept, I'm fine.'\"\n\n(Image: REX)\n\nDelilah's also making the couple think twice about getting involved in environmental activism with the controversial Extinction Rebellion.\n\nKeira dished: \"We keep having this discussion where we're saying to each other, 'Should we get arrested?' And I'm like, 'We can't, we've got a baby, she's permanently attached to my boob. So how's it going to work?'\n\n\"So then he's going, 'Maybe I'll go down and get arrested for both of us,' and I'm like, 'Let's neither of us get arrested now. It's not the right time.'\n\n\"I think a lot of us just want to find a reason not to think about it.\"", "description": "Keira opened up about the difficulties of breastfeeding her newborn with her busy schedule despite being on maternity leave", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Wireimage", "Corbis Via Getty Images", "Getty Images For Chanel", "Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20066448.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Chanel-Cruise-Collection-2020-Photocall-At-Grand-Palais-In-Paris.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
