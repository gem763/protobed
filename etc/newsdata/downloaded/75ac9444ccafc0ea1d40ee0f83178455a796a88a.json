Moreover, he said it was \u201chigh time for fiscal policy\u201d to take charge in shoring up the economy.\n\nDraghi, at the height of the eurozone debt crisis in July 2012, uttered the three-word phrase that will forever be associated with his tenure when he pledged the ECB would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro. Often overlooked, is that Draghi qualified the pledge with the words \u201cwithin our mandate.\u201d\n\nDraghi has spent much of his term testing the limits of that mandate, which is focused solely on price stability as reflected in an annual inflation target of near but just below 2%. Draghi gets a lot of sympathy from observers who note that the ECB had little choice but to pull out the stops on stimulus in the wake of the financial crisis and the eurozone\u2019s debt woes.\n\nThe region\u2019s elected politicians tended to dither, repeatedly kicking the proverbial can down the road when it came to bailouts while healthy economies, such as Germany, refused to contemplate fiscal stimulus. Even now, with Germany seen in danger of slipping into recession, politicians in Berlin are offering little more than halfhearted indications they would be open to delivering stimulus, but only once the economy is already in contraction.\n\nSeveral economists and analysts saw Thursday\u2019s ECB package as part of Draghi\u2019s effort to raise pressure on government officials to loosen the fiscal spigots.\n\n\u201cThe central bank has long felt that monetary stimulus alone won\u2019t be enough and by doubling down on a massive stimulus package, he\u2019s put the ball in their court,\u201d said Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, in a note. \u201cWith his bold curtain call, Draghi is taking the problem of low growth seriously and saying now its time for the governments to act.\u201d\n\nLien argued that Draghi\u2019s push for more fiscal stimulus was partly behind the euro\u2019s EURUSD, +0.2712% bounceback from its initial post-announcement fall.\n\nClaus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Draghi made clear that the ECB believes it\u2019s being pushed to take increasingly extreme actions as fiscal policy makers sit idle.\n\nBut the message could end up being too sobering. It raises dangers in that the more the ECB argues that its own stimulus measures are being rendered ineffective due to a lack of stimulus, the higher the risk that markets stop believing in what the central bank is doing, he said.\n\nVistesen argued that while Draghi was flirting with danger, fiscal policy makers are, in fact, likely to step up eventually and that the combination of loose monetary and fiscal policy in the next 12 months should be enough to give asset prices and growth a boost down the road.\n\nMeanwhile, Christine Lagarde, the former French finance minister and International Monetary Fund managing director who is set to take the reins from Draghi on Nov. 1, appears in harmony with Draghi\u2019s tune.\n\nIn comments before the European Parliament earlier this month, Lagarde said central banks \u201care not the only game in town,\u201d the Financial Times reported, saying richer eurozone governments with low deficits should be ready to spend more during downturns.", "description": "ECB President Mario Draghi is more explicit than ever about the limited ability of monetary policy to cure the euro area\u2019s longstanding economic ills,...", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR210_draghi_ZG_20190912134839.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
