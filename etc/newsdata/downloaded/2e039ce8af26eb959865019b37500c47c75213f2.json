Her latest book, Eat Green , will be out in January 2020\n\nMelissa Hemsley, food writer and TV personality, already boasts a busy and colourful career history at 34 years-old.\n\nWhile in their 20s and with a passion for healthy and simple cooking, she - alongside sister Jasmine - became chefs for private clients, working from their homes.\n\nThey soon found themselves catering for touring celebrity clients, and being asked to make their own TV show in Australia about clean eating.\n\nOver the last decade, the duo have regularly featured on television, written for magazines like Vogue and published a selection of cookery books, both under the join name Hemsley + Hemsley, as well as individually.\n\nMelissa's focus is now on sustainability and she is passionate about the importance of creating food sourced from suppliers that care \u2013 both about the environment and the community.\n\nAlongside that comes her passion for encouraging others to think and live sustainably too.\n\nThis year, she participated in a new programme for start-up businesses, where she spoke about turning your passion into a sustainable career.\n\nThe three-day mentorship programme, Workable Summer School, which took place last month and plans to return next year, aims to provide valuable guidance and inspiration to aspiring business leaders.\n\nThis is Money caught up with Melissa to find out about her career and ask how budding entrepreneurs can launch their business as sustainably as possible.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of turning your passion into a career?\n\nFor me, the pros far outweigh the low moments by a country mile. There will always be low, hard, messy, stressful moments but learning to deal with those moments has made me a stronger person and I've grown a lot.\n\nI'm on group chats with other business owners. We regularly meet up, and we message each other almost all week with supportive texts, cheesy jokes and words of wisdom that we might have had to learn the hard way. Sharing bad news is as important as sharing the good stuff.\n\nWhat's been the most challenging situation in your career to date?\n\nIt has probably been managing my stress levels and making a big dedicated shift to look after my mental health more and prioritising it.\n\nI used to be a perfectionist and now I'm a recovering perfectionist. I enjoy my work more when I take the pedal off a bit and rush less. I'm not racing with myself.\n\nBeing part of initiatives such as Bryony Gordon's Mental Health Mates and the community walk has been such a help because it's a regular reminder to take time out for myself\n\nAnd the most rewarding?\n\nI love live cooking demos and meeting people. I've had a great year so far from making lunch at kids school summer clubs in North London, as well as cooking at Countryfile Live. I always really enjoy the energy and feedback from that.\n\nCooking is fun and healthy cooking is delicious and not serious or boring.\n\nChatting to people after a demo when they come up with their children or their whole family, and share that the whole family enjoys my apple banana bread or that their kid helped make the fritters by grating up whatever veg they had in the fridge - that's the most rewarding part.\n\nAnd it's so helpful too, I want to share recipes that are genuinely useful and cookbooks that get loved and messy.\n\nRecently I've been asking the audience what ingredients they end up throwing away at the end of the week and it's been inspiring the recipes for my new cookbook.\n\nMelissa and her sister Jasmine have released two cookbooks under the name Hemsley + Hemsley, and Melissa released her first solo cookbook, Eat Happy , last year\n\nWhat are the key challenges that entrepreneurs face when starting out?\n\nA key challenge for entrepreneurs as they start their own businesses is a lack of experience and confidence in themselves.\n\nResearch Opinium and Workable shows that after a lack of financial support, people in the UK believe that a lack of experience (37 per cent), lack of confidence (33 per cent) and economic uncertainty (33 per cent) are the biggest factors holding them back from starting their own business.\n\nWhat's more, almost half of Britons identify 'advice and information on growth' as one of the most vital forms of support for start-ups \u2013 so the importance of mentoring and learning from other businesses has never been greater.\n\nAnd back to what I said before, stress can be a real challenge. At the Workable Summer School, I spoke a lot about my experience of managing stress and we spoke about ensuring you try to build a support network of other business owners, so you can help each other out, lend an ear, and lend advice.\n\nAnd, of course, eating healthy food to keep your energy up as well as making time to sleep. Think of sleep as a non-negotiable on the to-do list.\n\nThis year, Melissa participated in a new programme from Workable for start-up businesses, where she spoke about turning your passion into a sustainable career\n\nWhy is mentoring important and how can you get it?\n\nMentoring is hugely important. Along the way, I have had great support and advice from mentors and sharing the ups and downs with a community of colleagues has been integral and insightful. I'm a huge fan of sharing, giving back and learning from each other.\n\nGaining inspiration and support from other people running established businesses is vital when your business is in its first stages and beyond, so I was thrilled to share my experiences with young business owners at Workable.\n\nGetting involved in programmes like these can help you find the right people for you to go to for tips and advice.\n\nA number of experts and founders ran sessions for the attendees on topics ranging from how to promote health and wellbeing at work, developing confidence when presenting, developing a PR plan, and maximising social media.\n\nI met some brilliant entrepreneurs and am excited to see how their business ideas progress.\n\nWhat are the key things to do when setting up a small business?\n\nFirst of all, define your mission statement. Are you offering something your customer really needs? Is it a positive business? Is it meaningful?\n\nThen it is about understanding your core offering and not trying to offer too much at the beginning. You might confuse yourself and your customer and exhaust yourself too early. Offer something fantastic and something that is needed.\n\nOf course you need to be great at it so that you feel good about it and proud even during the difficult moments. Make customers happy so they are loyal and recommend you. From there, start offering the next arm.\n\nWhat about what not to do?\n\nLearn when to say no. I started as a private chef and then taught myself how to write recipes and started writing recipes for Vogue.\n\nI worked hard to get good enough at cooking to start writing recipes for our first cookbook.\n\nNow I'm finishing up my fourth cookbook.\n\nBut I've also said 'no, thank you' and turned down hundreds more things than I've said yes to.\n\nHow do you deal with things you're not so good at?\n\nIt's important to understand your weaknesses or as I like to call them, 'my weaker strengths' and invest in the right people to help you, such as an accountant.\n\nI've had the same accountant since the beginning. He's brilliant and super patient and not intimidating.\n\nWrite down an honest list of what you're good at and a list what you're less good at. Then ask for help for the second list.\n\nIt's also important to give yourself a structure to keep your work and life balance so you don't neglect your physical or mental health.\n\nGiving back to your community as much as you can is important for lots of reasons, it gives you perspective, gets you out of your own head and is rewarding.\n\nNo matter how tired I am, giving back to my community makes me feel energised.\n\nMelissa spoke at the Workable Summer School which took place this year in Stratford\n\nHow do you break into an area that might be particularly competitive?\n\nAt the time, there weren't very many businesses offering what my sister and I did.\n\nWe love eating delicious, healthy food and unsurprisingly so do lots of people. Our clients were looking for a bespoke service that offered just that.\n\nI think we were good at what we did as we made sure we really looked after our clients.\n\nIt sounds so simple, but we cared very much and took great care to do our jobs properly.\n\nWe didn't over-promise, we stuck to our offering and worked hard to do it to the best of our abilities. And I think that's key in your business.\n\nReally care about your customers, learn from them, listen to their feedback and work on it. And then, when your business is ready to expand, what better way than to have your happy, satisfied clients genuinely recommend you to their friends.\n\nHow important is listening to your gut and staying true to yourself?\n\nGreat question because I think it's the most important thing to do and should be on the daily to-do list.\n\nThere are hundreds of decisions to make every day, we can't know all the answers, but we can have a list of values that we match them against.\n\nThe mission statement I mentioned above and self-reflection and analysis of what you want to do/what you set out to do versus what you are actually doing is vital.\n\nI've made my better decisions when I've listened to my gut.\n\nI'm a fan of writing gratitude lists because it's all too easy to be really hard on yourself.\n\nI used to find it easier to think of times I've messed up rather than what I'm doing right. So, I quickly jot down what am I thankful for and what am I proud of.", "description": "Food writer and TV personality Melissa Hemsley discusses her career journey so far, the struggles she faced building her brand and shares her top tips for budding entrepreneurs.", "authors": ["Jayna Rana For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
