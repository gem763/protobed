The team discovered that, simply by visiting certain websites, users could make their devices vulnerable to hackers and let those hackers access sensitive information. Google disclosed its findings to Apple this past February and the exploits have since been patched, so if you don\u2019t already have the latest version of iOS, it\u2019s probably worth installing.\n\nThe robust security of iOS is frequently touted as one of its selling points. Unlike Android, Google\u2019s operating system, iOS only runs on a very limited number of hardware configurations and only allows applications to be installed that are approved through Apple\u2019s App Store. These properties combine to make it more difficult for hackers to take advantage of. That\u2019s what makes the disclosure all the more concerning. According to those who discovered the vulnerabilities, \u201cThere was no target discrimination; simply visiting the hacked site was enough for the exploit server to attack your device, and if it was successful, install a monitoring implant. We estimate that these sites receive thousands of visitors per week.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorking with TAG [Threat Analysis Group], we discovered exploits for a total of fourteen vulnerabilities across the five exploit chains: seven for the iPhone\u2019s web browser, five for the kernel and two separate sandbox escapes,\u201d Project Zero member and iOS security expert Ian Beer writes. \u201cInitial analysis indicated that at least one of the privilege escalation chains was still 0-day and unpatched at the time of discovery.\u201d The \u201ckernel\u201d is the base operating system of iOS, and \u201csandbox escapes\u201d refer to \u201csandboxing,\u201d the practice of isolating one part of a computer system from another.\n\nThe capabilities of the \u201cimplant\u201d that researchers discovered are extensive. Perhaps most concerning is the implant\u2019s ability to access unencrypted messages from platforms like WhatsApp and Apple\u2019s own iMessage service (the messages are encrypted when sent between devices, but unencrypted on the device so that they can be, you know, read). The implant could then upload those unencrypted contents to the hacker\u2019s server.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! The implant can access and upload the Contacts database of iOS, the photos on the device, unique identifiers like the IDs for the SIM card and the serial number, and \u201ccan also upload the user\u2019s location in real time, up to once per minute, if the device is online.\u201d\n\nIt somehow gets worse? The implant also gives hackers access to the iOS device keychain, the database that stores a user\u2019s login credentials for a number of things, from websites to Wi-Fi networks. Certain types of credentials accessed by the implant \u2014 long-lived tokens \u2014 let hackers maintain access to a user\u2019s account even after the malware has been wiped from the device.\n\nThe slight bit of good news is that anyone who visited a malicious website that deployed the implant can prevent it from running by rebooting their device (and further prevent it by upgrading their version of iOS to the latest available). One detail that stands out, however, is that Google\u2019s team found the implant running in plain sight. On desktop operating systems and on Android, users can access a list of processes running on the device in programs like Task Manager (Windows) and Activity Monitor (macOS). However, iOS has no such function.\n\nThe implant runs \u201cin the background as root. There is no visual indicator on the device that the implant is running,\u201d Beer writes. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for a user on iOS to view a process listing, so the implant binary makes no attempt to hide its execution from the system.\u201d In short, Apple\u2019s attempt to hide the nitty-gritty of computer maintenance and cybersecurity from users made it next to impossible for anyone other than Apple to discover the exploits.
