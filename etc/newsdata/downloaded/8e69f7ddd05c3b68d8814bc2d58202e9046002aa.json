As Joseph Stalin raced to turn an agricultural backwater into an industrialized nation, his government downsized the week from seven to five days. Saturday and Sunday were abolished.\n\nIn place of the weekend, a new system of respite was introduced in 1929. The government divided workers into five groups, and assigned each to a different day off. On any given day, four-fifths of the proletariat would show up to their factories and work while the other fifth rested. Each laborer received a colored slip of paper\u2014yellow, orange, red, purple, or green\u2014that signified his or her group. The staggered schedule was known as nepreryvka, or the \u201ccontinuous workweek,\u201d since production never stopped.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/static/a/theatlantic/img/default-thumbnail.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
