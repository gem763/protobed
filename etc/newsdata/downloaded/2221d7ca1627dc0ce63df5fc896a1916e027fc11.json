We had both got married in Vegas in September but were having a second 'wedding' as such in front of our loved ones in Hull.\n\n\"As soon as Regina walked in to the room, Rob shouted to my brother and then everyone turned around and started filming.\n\n(Image: Regina Sparkles / Hull Live)\n\n\"Me and my cousin and obviously Regina were the only ones that knew about it, so it came as a shock.\"\n\nHappily, Mr Holgate saw the funny side of the prank and the act also kept the guests well entertained.\n\n\"Rob went really red, but he was laughing,\" Lyndsey added. \"It's normally him doing the pranks on others, especially when he's had a drink as then he's always winding people up, so it was funny to see him on the receiving end of it.\n\n\"I'm not a traditional person and didn't want a head table or anything like that, so through the stunt we brought fun to a serious occasion.\n\n\"The video went around all the guests that had joined us in the evening that hadn't seen what happened and they thought it was hilarious. I even think the video has gone viral now as well.\n\n(Image: Regina Sparkles / Hull Live)\n\n\"It was definitely money well spent for the experience and Regina was so professional - I would highly recommend her.\"\n\nThe experience of teasing the groom was something that Regina Sparkles also relished.\n\nShe performs as a vivacious, outgoing and bubbly character throughout Yorkshire and pursued drag as a career in 2017 after securing a business mentor from The Prince's Trust.\n\nSince then, Regina has worked full time in Hull, Leeds and Manchester and regularly attends LGBT+ events in Yorkshire to help spread the message that 'it's OK to be you'.\n\nRegina travelled to Market Weighton to buy her dress for the wedding stunt and live streamed the gag on her Facebook page. The video has now drawn in more than 4,700 views.\n\n(Image: Regina Sparkles / Hull Live)\n\n\"When I got asked to dress up as a bride by Lyndsey for my performance at the wedding, my partner said to me, 'don't outshine the bride', but I said, 'I'm a drag queen, of course I'm going to have to outshine the bride',\" said Regina.\n\n\"I went all the way to Market Weighton for my dress and got my flowers from Dunhelm Mill for \u00a317, but they started to fall apart as soon as I started hitting the groom with them.\n\n\"The bride Lyndsey emailed me to explain what she wanted and I was completely on board with it and thought it would be so funny.\n\n\"As soon as I walked in I could see the guests looking at me and thinking 'who is this? What is going on?'\n\n\"I was a little bit nervous beforehand but it felt fantastic to do it and Lyndsey told me she was happy with how it went.\n\n\"I'm used to performing and moving my lips to music and I had it live streamed. We are at more than 4,700 views now of the video so you could even say that it's gone viral.\"", "description": "The bride thought she would get her own back on \"joker\" Rob - who thankfully saw the funny side", "authors": ["Anna Riley", "Chris Flanagan", "Image", "Regina Sparkles", "Hull Live"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20638994.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Drag-queen-stuns-groom-and-guests-with-hilarious-wedding-day-prank.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
