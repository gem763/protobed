They need liquidity and breadth of liquidity. It's not enough for Apple to have all the liquidity and then the next 500 companies to not have any,\" he said.\n\n\"It's going to be a challenge for exchanges and regulators to show how they can create enough liquidity to make it attractive enough for public companies to exist.\"\n\nOver the next five years it\u2019s likely we have a downturn. \u2014 Mario Giannini, Hamilton Lane\n\nHamilton Lane is responsible for more than $US484 billion of assets across private markets ranging from buyout, growth assets, credit, impact investments and real estate. Its funds largely come from investment managers on behalf of superannuation, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds.\n\nHamilton Lane has been in Australia for about two decades, but earlier this year it created a fund aimed at high net worth Australian investors for the first time, tapping into the trend of investors looking to private markets as the diversity of assets available in public markets becomes less.\n\nMore deals\n\nData from Hamilton Lane reveals that the private market investor is on track for a record number of investment opportunities in 2019, at more than 2000. Since 2011 the number of opportunities assessed annually by the firm has steadily been rising, with a major increase between 2017 and 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt experienced an 87 per cent jump in venture capital deals between 2011 and 2018, a 33 per cent jump in the number of real asset opportunities and a 26 per cent increase in the number of buyout deals on the table.\n\nMr Giannini said the growth in private market deals and the increased interest from investors of all sizes would lead to the creation of new categories, like Hamilton Lane\u2019s fund for high net worth investors, as well as new firms.\n\n\u201cWill there be a firm developed tomorrow to allow for secondary investments into unicorns? Yes, I can see that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlternatively, we could open up that business line. I think it\u2019ll be a combination of people like us that already have the scale creating a product to meet demand, or funds appearing to meet that.\u201d\n\nHe also said new exchanges would be created to better facilitate private transactions.\n\nLess risk than expected\n\nWhile overall Mr Giannini believed that private market investment was substantially less risky than many investors considered, he said that venture capital deals still contained the most risk.\n\nAnalysis by Hamilton Lane of private market returns in the worst five year period since 1995, indicated that while venture capital investments fell 15.8 per cent in value in their worst five years, other private market categories like developed market buyouts and private credit never lost value over any five year period in more than two decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Giannini also said that valuations of start-ups and unicorns had been driven up, in part because of favourable trends in private markets, but more so because of the creation of a handful of mega venture capital funds like Softbank.\n\nThese high valuations were what was causing his \"worry indicator\" to go up, despite most general partners (GPs) in private equity funds being more cautious than they have been when markets have neared their peaks in the past. This suggests GPs have learnt a lesson from the global financial crisis bust and are being more disciplined, he said.\n\nOn a scale of one to 100, with 100 being the highest level of worry, Hamilton Lane's worry indicator for private equity was sitting at 64 (its highest rating since 2007) and came in above real estate and credit markets.\n\n\"We're more worried than we have been in 10 years,\" Mr Giannini said.\n\n\"The index reflects the high prices and the high leverage. People need to be careful now about what deals they do and what GPs they invest with.\n\n\"I think over the next five years it\u2019s likely we have a downturn, but I don\u2019t expect it to be anything like '07 or '08.\"", "description": "Renowned private equity investor Mario Giannini says more capital from super funds will go into private markets, as there are fewer investible public assets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4082%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_451%2C$y_66/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a1b8fa24b8f059b9fc9576fbfbacc36b9ce0cd3e", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
