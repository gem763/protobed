UK will maintain (the) highest standards of workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards when we leave the EU,\u201d business minister Andrea Leadsom said on Twitter in reply to the FT report.\n\nHowever Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the FT report showed members of parliament would be unwise to trust government promises on workers\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cThese documents confirm our worst fears. Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit is a blueprint for a deregulated economy, which will see vital rights and protections torn up,\u201d he said.\n\nJunior business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said it was not in the government\u2019s interest to seek to loosen employment rules.\n\n\u201cI think this is completely mad, actually,\u201d he said when asked about the FT report by the BBC. \u201cNineteen Labour MPs have come with us and voted for a second reading (of Brexit legislation). It would not make any sense at all to dilute workers\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\nUnder the Brexit deal negotiated by Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May - which parliament rejected three times - the United Kingdom as a whole would have been bound by some \u201clevel playing field\u201d commitments as part of a customs agreement.\n\nAccording to Johnson\u2019s deal, only Northern Ireland will be obliged to continue to follow rules similar to those in the EU, and the rest of the UK can diverge if it is willing to accept greater barriers to trade with the EU.\n\nMost economists think preserving trade ties with the EU should be a priority after Brexit, and see few obvious gains from significantly different regulation.", "description": "Britain's government denied a newspaper report on Saturday that it will seek to weaken workers' rights after Britain leaves the European Union, with one minister describing the idea as \"completely mad\".", "authors": ["David Milliken", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445171428&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P0AM", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
