'I had the perfect spot-landing alright, you could say. I am a novice pilot anyway and last Sunday was windy.\n\n'How the heck it got in the top of the chimney I don't know. Even if you tried to get it in there you'd be banging into the sides. It was unbelievable.'\n\nIn desperation club members got in touch with Royal Naval Air Station Culdrose at Helston on the off chance the navy could help.\n\nA relieved Roger Bath is pictured taking back his model airplane after the Navy helicopter rescued it\n\nThe Navy squadron lowers one of its team onto the chimney to rescue Roger Bath's model plane in Cornwall\n\nLuckily on Wednesday members of 824 Naval Air Squadron which trains Merlin helicopter crews already had a training exercise planned.\n\nLt Donell Fairweather was lowered on a winch line to the top of the chimney where he grabbed the aircraft and was then lowered to the ground nearby while the helicopter landed in a field next to the chimney.\n\nLt Cdr Steve Thomas said the task was 'far from simple'. He said: 'We had a three and half hour training sortie booked for the afternoon and this was a genuinely valuable training opportunity for a student pilot who had been given an usual search and rescue scenario and staff rear crew who had the task of conducting the rescue.\n\n'We spent a great deal of time and effort planning and considering all possible options, plans and dangers.\n\n'Everyone gets more out of doing something like this than they do just training at the airfield.'\n\nMr Bath and his fellow club members were delighted with the recovery and thanked the crew for their help.", "description": "Roger Bath was dumbfounded when his plane got stuck on the tall engine house chimney near Nancegollan, Cornwall, but luckily the Navy lowered a lieutenant to retrieve it.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/11/20125996-0-image-a-2_1571912406243.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
