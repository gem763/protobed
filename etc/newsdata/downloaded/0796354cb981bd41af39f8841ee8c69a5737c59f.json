A police officer filmed her distraught testimony on his mobile phone and it was leaked after the teacher was arrested.\n\nDespite the increasing threats of violence against her, Rafi continued going to class and on April 6, reportedly was lured to a building rooftop at her school. She was then surrounded by several burqa-clad individuals who demanded that she retract her police report.\n\nAfter refusing, the Police Bureau of Investigation Chief told the BBC, the student was doused in kerosene and set alight \u2013but their plan to \u201cmake it look like a suicide\u201d failed after the severely injured Rafi was rescued.\n\nGRUESOME RAPE, MURDER OF KASHMIR GIRL RAISES TENSIONS\n\nShe suffered burns to more than 80 percent of her body, and died ten days later. But while being rushed to hospital via ambulance and in one final act of courage, Rafi recorded a statement on her brother\u2019s phone exposing some of her attackers as fellow students.\n\n\u201cThe teacher touched me,\u201d she reportedly said. \u201cI will fight this crime till my last breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a woman tries to get justice for sexual harassment, she has to face a lot of harassment again,\u201d Salma Ali, a human rights lawyer and former director of the Women Lawyers\u2019 Association, told the BBC. \u201cThe case lingers for years, there is shaming in society, a lack of willingness from the police to properly investigate the allegations. It leads the victim to give up on seeking justice.\u201d\n\nNUNS SEXUALLY ABUSING MINORS COULD BECOME NEXT CATHOLIC CHURCH SCANDAL, EXPERTS SAY\n\nBut given the wave of media attention and the outpouring of anger that has arisen in the wake of Rafi\u2019s murder, some remain hopeful that at least some justice might be served. The case is under investigation and authorities have already determined law enforcement negligence in the initial response to her complaints.\n\nMore than a dozen arrests reportedly have been made related to her murder.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt a news conference this week, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) also took aim at the Islamic school for a long track record of ignoring previous grievances against the headmaster\u2019s behavior toward female students.\n\n\u201cIf the administration from the district level to madrasa acted responsibly, then the incident would never have taken place,\u201d noted Kazi Reazul Haque, the NHRC chairman. \u201cWe questioned how (the head teacher) was appointed as the principal despite having this kind of past.\u201d", "description": "A Bangladeshi teenager who braved the shame and taboo of being sexually harassed by reporting her ordeal to officials, has been doused with kerosene at school and burned to death.", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
