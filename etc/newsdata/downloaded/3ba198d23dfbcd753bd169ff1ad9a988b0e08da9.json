It's good on fuel. No, this doesn't mean you can throw a fiver in it, break down after 80 miles then ring me saying I lied about the fuel economy. Use your noggin.\n\n\"The car is a three door. One door on the left, one door on the right and a tailgate to the rear. You may use any of those doors to enter and exit the vehicle if you want to mix things up a bit.\"\n\n(Image: Deadline News)\n\nLaura adds the vehicle is open to a full inspection, including seeing which awful lowering spring you could add to it, how big the boot is to put your sub-woofer in and how many 99p blue bulbs you can cram into the interior to really complete the look.\n\nShe ended the advert with a warning that if you come to view the car, realise she's a woman and attempt to blag that the car is broken in anyway shape or form, she will waste 50 minutes of your time, going along with your lies and getting your hopes up before 'kindly telling you to p*** off'.\n\n\"So yep. There you have it. Fiesta. Grey. Diesel. Goes brum. \u00a3275.\"\n\nFacebook users found the post hilarious, with one replying: \"That is first class, absolutely love it.\"\n\n(Image: Deadline News)\n\nOthers asked her to help sell their own vehicles and Laura was surprised with the amount of attention the post attracted.\n\n\"I posted it the way I did because I honestly hate selling cars due to the amount of idiots it seems to attract,\" she said.\n\n\"So I simply worded the advert in idiot terms and for some reason it just blew up. I had 130 shares which I was shocked about, then it shot up to just under 42,000 shares overnight.\n\n\"I rang my brother and just said 'have you seen Facebook?'\n\n\"He hadn't, so I told him to have a look. He hung up to check the post then rang me back. His response was something along the lines of 'how on earth?', followed by 'has it sold more to the point?'\"\n\nDespite the modest vehicle's sudden rise to fame, the pair are yet to find a buyer for the car that goes brum.", "description": "Laura Jones came up with the no-nonsense advert to ward off time-wasters", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Deadline News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20537945.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-DN_VIRAL_CAR_ADVERT___4_JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
