Indonesia is celebrating its 74th anniversary of independence from the Dutch colonial rule AP\n\nNow, a trial court will determine whether Mr Cunningham\u2019s reported views and behaviour warrant a new trial for Halprin.\n\n\u201cThe ruling is a very strong signal that the court is not going to tolerate bigotry in criminal courts in Texas,\u201d said Tivon Schardl, one of Halprin\u2019s lawyers.\n\nThe decision from the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is just the latest twist in the sentencing of a group of defendants known as the Texas Seven, four of whom have been executed.\n\nHalprin and six other men carried out a string of robberies after escaping from prison in December 2000. During their last holdup, they were confronted by officer Aubrey Hawkins, and several men opened fire, killing the officer and dragging him with a car.\n\nHalprin has always said he did not fire a gun; at trial, he told a jury that he had not wanted to carry a gun and \u201cfreaked out\u201d when the other men began shooting. His lawyers have argued that their client was at the bottom of the Texas Seven hierarchy.\n\nBut Halprin was convicted and sentenced to death in 2003 under a fiercely debated Texas statute known as the law of parties, which allows accomplices to be punished as if they had been the ones to pull the trigger.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The denials began to stack up. Finally, on Friday, one of his appeals persuaded Texas\u2019 highest court to stay his execution, which had been scheduled for 10 October. Halprin\u2019s lawyers had found several people who said that the judge who oversaw their client\u2019s murder conviction", "authors": ["Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/06/10/halprin-death-row.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
