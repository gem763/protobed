However, no technical events of import were generated on the charts, leaving all in short term downtrends. The data has turned back to neutral, including all of the McClellan 1-Day OB/OS Oscillators from yesterday\u2019s pre-open oversold levels that we suspected might result in a near term bounce. As such, we have yet to see a sufficient shift in the weight of the evidence to alter our near term \u201cneutral/negative\u201d outlook for the major equity indexes.\n\nOn the charts, all of the major equity indexes closed higher yesterday with positive internals as trading volumes declined from the prior negative session.\n\n\u00b7 While we resist placing too much emphasis on recent trading volumes, the fact that down sessions have seen notably higher trading volumes than up sessions suggests, in our opinion, the presence of institutional distribution.\n\n\u00b7 No technical events of import were generated on the charts.\n\n\u00b7 Thus all remain in their near term downtrends and below their 50 DMAs.\n\n\u00b7 The cumulative advance/decline lines for the All Exchange, NYSE and NASDAQ remain negative while the high \u201cvolume at price\u201d (VAP) levels are resistant on all but the SPX (page 2), DJI (page 2) and NDX (page 3) where they are supportive.\n\n\u00b7 In our view, the cumulative A/Ds and VAP levels describe a bifurcated market as mentioned in yesterday\u2019s note.\n\nThe data is entirely neutral as all of the 1 day McClellan OB/OS Oscillators relieved yesterday\u2019s pre-open oversold condition (All Exchange:-44.49 NYSE:-47.52 NASDAQ:-44.12).\n\n\u00b7 The detrended Rydex Ratio (contrary indicator) is a neutral -0.66 as is the % of SPX stocks trading above their 50 DMAs at 38.6%.\n\n\u00b7 The AAII Bear/Bull Ratio (contrary indicators) remains neutral at 33.0/28.33. However, the Investor\u2019s Intelligence Bear/Bull Ratio (contrary indicator) remains bearish at 17.1/55.3 suggesting an excess of bullish sentiment on the part of investment advisors.\n\n\u00b7 The Open Insider Buy/Sell Ratio is also neutral at 55.4.\n\n\u00b7 Valuation seems appealing with forward 12 month earnings estimates for the SPX dipping to $174.71 via Bloomberg, leaving the forward p/e at a 16.7 multiple while the \u201crule of twenty\u201d finds fair value at 18.4.\n\n\u00b7 The stands at 1.59%.\n\n\u00b7 The earnings yield is 5.99%.\n\nIn conclusion, yesterday\u2019s gains did not result in any technical or data signals that would warrant altering our current near term \u201cneutral/negative\u201d outlook for the major equity indexes.\n\n: 2,893/2,956\n\n: 26,027/26,562\n\n: 7,787/7,995\n\n: 7,538/7,781\n\n: 9,818/10,183\n\n: 1,861/1,903\n\n: 1,471/1,515\n\nVALUA: 5,901/6,076", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Guy S.
