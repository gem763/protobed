The White House has not yet indicated how it intends to act.\n\nSacoolas' husband Jonathan is understood to have been working at RAF Croughton, a known US-spy base.

She was driving down the wrong side of the road when, his parents say, she hit him 'head on' while he drove his motorcycle. He died in the hospital afterwards\n\nOn Monday, Harry's parents did a tour of US media outlets to plead their case.\n\nThey told Today they were 'appalled and disgusted' that Sacoolas had not been forced to answer questions and said the process has left them unable to grieve their son's death.\n\nSacoolas on her wedding day in 2003. She is married to US diplomat Jonathan Sacoolas\n\n'We've got no answers. We've got nothing from her to say that she's remorseful...we're appalled, we're disgusted.\n\n'We haven't started to grieve properly yet because nothing's at rest,' his mother Charlotte Charles said.\n\nThe US embassy has refused to grant Northamptonshire Police a waiver to interview Sacoolas as a suspect.\n\nAccording to a lawyer retained by the Dunn family, Jonathan Sacoolas was working at RAF Croughton, a 'communications base'.\n\n'He was working with intelligence which is, I guess, why it has been handled in the way that it has,' the lawyer said.\n\nAs anger over the actions intensified, Harry's mother called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to 'get on the phone' to President Donald Trump.\n\nShe told the Daily Mail: 'We would ask Boris Johnson himself, if he hasn't already, to call President Trump and urge him to right this wrong.\n\n'It's inhumane what has happened to us. Please. I'm begging you. Please help us. We won't be able to grieve and move on and try put the pieces of our shattered lives together until we get justice for Harry.'\n\nHarry's parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn are pictured during an interview with NBC's Today on Monday morning\n\nMr Dunn is pictured with his mother Charlotte Charles. Ms Charles said: 'We would ask Boris Johnson himself, if he hasn't already, to call President Trump and urge him to right this wrong'\n\nBORIS JOHNSON SAYS HE WILL ASK TRUMP TO SEND DIPLOMAT'S WIFE BACK TO UK Boris Johnson speaking on Monday about the incident British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he intended to intervene to ask the White House to waive Sacoolas' immunity in order for her to be questioned by police. 'I do not think it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose,' Johnson said on Monday when asked about the boy's death. It remains unclear how the White House will respond. The US Ambassador already wrote to Dunn's family to express his condolences but the family says it has not heard from Sacoolas. Police in Northamptonshire, England, say she was initially cooperative and told them she did not intend to leave the country but later fled. 'We were aware that diplomatic immunity had been raised as an issue, and we then made an immediate application for a waiver in order for us to undertake further investigation and interview. 'Unfortunately, we were latterly advised that the waiver had been declined and that the suspect had left the UK,' Sarah Johnson, Northamptonshire Police Superintendent, said. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had contacted US Ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, to share his 'disappointment' over how the incident had been handled.\n\nSky have learned in early 1994 the US and UK governments struck a deal that all those working in RAF Croughton and their families would have diplomatic protection.\n\nThe broadcaster also report that Mrs Sacoolas has not returned to her home in the US.\n\nSky also say that very soon after the crash Mrs Sacoolas made it known that she had diplomatic immunity but police had the impression she was willing to cooperate so they applied to get the immunity waived. However, they found that she had left.\n\nIt was then that they found out that 'someone at the us embassy' advised her and her family to return to the US.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab has called on the US ambassador to 'reconsider' the decision but it is understood so far his appeals have been refused.\n\nThe Government says it is doing 'everything it can' but Harry's mother said she feared her son's death would be 'swept under the carpet'.\n\nThe mother, who works in a doctor's practice, said her family, including Harry's twin brother Niall, were devastated and heartbroken but had been 'totally deprived of the ability to grieve'.\n\n'Please just come back. We want to talk to you and understand how you are feeling about what happened. Please come back and face the consequences of your actions. Charlotte Charles, Harry Dunn's mother\n\nAsked what message she would give the American woman, she said: 'Please just come back.\n\n'We want to talk to you and understand how you are feeling about what happened. Please come back and face the consequences of your actions. It will be better for us both.' In a direct appeal to President Trump, she added: 'Sit back and look back at the case.\n\n'Consider not just the politics side of it, but the fact there is a completely broken family.'\n\nShe said for weeks after the crash on August 27, no one from the Ministry of Defence or RAF Croughton had been in contact. 'We've just been left.'\n\nHarry, who worked at a gas station, was an avid motorcyclist with more than 50,000 miles under his belt. His family said he was a 'highly experienced, safe and capable rider' who was 'riding perfectly safely...travelling on his own side of the road' when he was in collision with the woman's Volvo.\n\nHis family said they have been told the woman had been travelling for 400 yards on the wrong side of the road.\n\nEmergency services were called but Harry had suffered multiple injuries and was pronounced dead in hospital. It is understood Sacoolas, a mother-of-three, had her eldest child in the car with her at the time.\n\nHarry was driving his motorcycle when his parents say he was hit head-on by Sacoolas' car. He is shown as a younger boy\n\nHarry's father Tim Dunn received a call from a firefighter at the scene who was a family friend and recognized Harry.\n\nIt is unclear what time of day the crash occurred.\n\nShe added: 'We didn't get to see him before they lost him. His injuries were horrific. They had done all they could.'\n\nSacoolas was spoken to the next day by police when she told officers she had no plans to leave the UK in the 'near future'.\n\nThe Northamptonshire force said during the meeting 'diplomatic immunity had been raised as an issue'.\n\nOfficers then sought to obtain a waiver from the US embassy \u2013 which is required to allow for the arrest and formal interview of a suspect with diplomatic immunity.\n\nRAF Croughton, where Sacoolas' husband worked. Dunn's parents say she turned out of the base and drove 400 yards down the wrong side of the road before hitting him\n\nBut the force said it was later informed that the waiver had been refused and the woman had left the country despite the fact that officers had been preparing to send a file to the Crown Prosecution Service over charges of causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nThe family were informed the day after Harry's funeral.\n\nHarry's family believe she was spirited out of the UK quickly as her husband is a spy and because US authorities wanted to ensure his identity was not compromised.\n\nThe US state department refused to answer questions on the case but said 'immunity is rarely waived'. UK sources confirmed the woman had 'full diplomatic immunity'.\n\nHarry's mother said, if necessary, the family would travel to the US to seek answers. They are also considering a civil claim for compensation against the state department or from the insurers of the woman's vehicle.\n\nDefense expert Stephen Lanyard, a retired US colonel, said: 'Once a claim of diplomatic immunity is made and a person has left the country there is very little that can be done to bring them back.'", "description": "Anne Sacoolas, left, was facing possible charges of causing death by dangerous driving\u00a0after Harry Dunn's, right, death\u00a0in August near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.", "authors": ["Lauren Fruen For Dailymail.Com", "Jemma Carr For Mailonline", "Claire Duffin", "Arthur Martin", "Helen Weathers For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/05/19380924-0-image-a-46_1570424347979.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
