Their sacrifice and courageous stand addressed the two-tier wages structure and permanent temporary worker classification that has plagued working class Americans.\"\n\nWorkers who voted across the country this week could be back on the assembly line as soon as Friday night or Saturday morning as GM looks to resume production after a labor dispute that cost the automaker an estimated $2 billion.\n\nGeneral Motors workers voted 57.2% in favor of a new contract with the company, with 23,389 voting for deal and 17,501 voting against it, according to a statement Friday from the United Auto Workers union. The union now will turn its attention to bargaining with crosstown rival Ford Motor Co.\n\nUAW leaders succeeded in winning wage hikes and other benefits for members employed by the automaker, but failed to convince GM not to close three U.S. factories.\n\nThe proposal gives GM workers a 3% raise and 4% lump-sum increase in alternating years, akin to what they had in their last contract. GM's roughly 46,000 permanent workers will receive an $11,000 signing bonus, and its 3,000 temporary workers are set to get $4,500. The automaker also agreed to nix a $12,000 limit on profit-sharing that gives each worker $1,000 for every billion dollars GM earns. The agreement also keeps GM's generous health plan intact.\n\nGM workers on strike set to vote on new labor deal\n\nGM agreed to build electric trucks and vans at its Detroit-Hamtramck factory, one of four scheduled to close before the walkout began. The agreement lets GM close three plants: Baltimore Operations in Maryland, Lordstown Assembly in Ohio and Warren Transmission in Michigan.\n\nThe strike's impact could be felt throughout the auto industry as GM suppliers laid off workers in reacting to the slowdown.\n\nGM reports earnings on Tuesday, which should shed further light on the strike's impact on the automaker.\n\n--With reporting from The Associated Press.", "description": "Union salutes autoworker's \"sacrifice\" after calling an end to the longest walkout against the car maker since 1970", "authors": ["Kate Gibson"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/26/62a965eb-7554-422c-bda4-678e74a11fce/thumbnail/1200x630/d8c7e3b94c679e3e761276dcf1a25632/strike-gettyimages-1171035339.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
