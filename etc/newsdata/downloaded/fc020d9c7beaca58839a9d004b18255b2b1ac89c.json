I think in the second half was better.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it to be like this, it\u2019s not good for us, the federation and our country. How do I feel? I don\u2019t feel good because we didn\u2019t play well, we lost 6-0 and also this what happened was terrible.\n\n\u201cIt must stop. In this country, we have a team like Ludogorets, who have players from every country, I never listened (heard) this sort of problem in the Bulgarian championship and I don\u2019t know why they made like this because many fans are fans and supporters of English football.\n\n\u201cThere are fan clubs from Chelsea , Liverpool , Manchester, it\u2019s incredible and I don\u2019t know why they made this. For me, it\u2019s incredible, a surprise.\n\n\u201cIn every big city they have fan clubs, like in Sofia, they have several fan clubs for every big club.\u201d", "description": "Bulgaria midfielder Ivelin Popov pleaded with his own fans to stop their racist chanting during their Euro 2020 qualifier with England", "authors": ["John Cross", "Image", "Itv", "Vassil Donev Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581783.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Popov.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
