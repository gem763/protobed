Blunt has pointed out, is the process in the House to which the president is being subjected is totally unprecedented and totally unfair,\u201d McConnell told reporters after the lunch.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Albert laid out procedural guidelines during the Nixon episode \u2014 Speaker Gingrich during the Clinton impeachment episode \u2014 all of which included the kind of basic procedural safeguards that one associates in our country with being treated fairly,\u201d he said.\n\nA Republican senator who spoke on condition of anonymity said McConnell gave his colleagues leeway to express opposition to various Trump actions, such as pulling U.S. troops out of northern Syria, but urged them to stick together on process.\n\n\u201cHe feels everybody is free to talk about issues like Ukraine or maybe the Kurds, but to try to conduct an impeachment without any process is very contrary to what happened before,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cThat pretty much sums it up.\u201d\n\nA second Republican senator said McConnell and Blunt thought it made sense to give the Senate GOP conference a primer on past impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cIt was a logical second place to go after the informational hearing on how impeachment will work in the Senate so members will know when they are talking about this process why it\u2019s different than the way this has been done before,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say it\u2019s unfair. It\u2019s another thing to say here are all the boxes that were checked for Clinton and Nixon, and none of these boxes have been checked for this president.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s effort came a day after Trump, at a Cabinet meeting, complained that Democrats are much more unified than Republicans on impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe two things they have: They\u2019re vicious and they stick together,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyOvernight Defense: Trump's Syria envoy wasn't consulted on withdrawal | McConnell offers resolution urging Trump to rethink Syria | Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Trump's Syria envoy says he wasn't consulted on troop withdrawal Trump 'lynching' comparison draws backlash from lawmakers MORE in their midst. They don\u2019t have people like that.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe comment appeared to be in reaction to Sen. Mitt Romney\u2019s (R-Utah) interview with \u201cAxios on HBO\u201d in which he expressed openness to voting to remove Trump from office.\n\nYet Republicans say Trump makes it harder on a daily basis for them to defend him.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump compared his impeachment process to a \u201clynching,\u201d language Senate Republicans did not want to defend. McConnell later told reporters that Trump\u2019s use of the word was \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the history in our country, I would not compare this to a lynching,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe GOP leader also distanced himself from Trump\u2019s Oct. 3 claim that McConnell had expressed approval of the content of his controversial July 25 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which prompted the House to launch impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cHe read my phone call with the president of Ukraine. Mitch McConnell, he said, \u2018That was the most innocent phone call that I\u2019ve read.\u2019 I mean, give me a break,\u201d Trump said.\n\nMcConnell said he did not recall the conversation.\n\n\u201cWe have not had any conversations on this subject,\u201d he said Tuesday.\n\nOther Republicans have expressed discomfort with Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\nRomney called Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d\n\nSen. Ben Sasse Benjamin (Ben) Eric Sasse NBA commissioner says China asked league to fire Rocket's GM Lawmakers set to host fundraisers focused on Nats' World Series trip Hong Kong protesters trample, burn LeBron James jerseys in wake of comments MORE (R-Neb.) said there was \u201cterrible stuff\u201d in the transcript of the call and warned, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be having any American officeholder or any American candidate looking for foreign nations to come in and be involved in U.S. elections.\u201d\n\nSen.

So what do we have as a result of that? We have a process that\u2019s going on in secret. We have selective leaking, without much material coming out,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo rules are set out. President\u2019s lawyers aren\u2019t allowed to see the evidence or challenge evidence. Ranking members don\u2019t have the ability to have subpoena power. What\u2019s common about all of those things? In the past two impeachment efforts, all of those things have been exactly the opposite,\u201d he added.\n\nJordain Carney contributed.", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is urging Republicans to focus on Democrats and their tactics in seeking to mount an effective defense of President Trump on impeachment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mcconnellmitch_102219gn2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
