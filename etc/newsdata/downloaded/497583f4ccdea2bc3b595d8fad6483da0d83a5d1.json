Why do you think this is?\n\nRahaman Ali: Muhammad and I made frequent trips to the UK and we loved the people. One of the reasons is because when my brother\u2019s license to box was revoked, America turned against him but the fans in England continued their support for Muhammad. Moreover, a man by the name of Paddy Monaghan, who was a boxer himself and a great admirer of my brother, actually pursued a petition. He was one of Muhammad\u2019s biggest fans. So, being respected and admired by UK fans touched my brother and he told me that.\n\nQ: So the fans in the UK quickly came to embrace The Greatest when his own people were turning their backs on him?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nRahaman Ali: Yes. Muhammad and I quickly came to realise this and it left an indelible mark in our hearts. Travelling to England was always exciting and even though my brother fought English boxing heroes, the fans supported him regardless. Muhammad and I would jog in Hyde Park, we would walk the streets and he\u2019d be running and stopping to sign autographs.\n\nQ: Boxing as a sport was catapulted further when your brother came on the scene, why do you think that was?\n\nRahaman Ali: It\u2019s obvious that my brother had cultivated this persona that sucked you in. I remember how he would work his magic and just mesmerise the audience wherever we went. I\u2019d be in the background right by his side, and he\u2019d turn into this \u201cactor\u201d spouting his poetry and exuding this confidence that really made him more than merely a boxer. You have to remember that Muhammad was probably the first sportsman of his calibre who went from the back pages onto the front pages in the press. In the ring he dazzled the audience with his skills and his mouth didn\u2019t shut when he was fighting. He would continue to shout, scream and belittle his opponent while at the same time try to knock him out in the round he\u2019d predicted at the press conference. I mean, it was a lot of pressure but he was one of the most confident humans I ever knew.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

October top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 3/11 9. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 4/11 8. Gennady Golovkin (39-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. The boxing legend is now a two-time world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 6/11 6. Errol Spence (26-0-0) Spence beat Shawn Porter to unify the welterweight division as he goes in search of more belts. Danny Garcia looks set to be next. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (17-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion has successfully moved up in weight, beating Chazz Witherspoon on his heavyweight debut. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\nQ: Would your parents watch him fight?\n\nRahaman Ali: Yes. Our mother and father would be at the fights. They were very supportive. I was fighting on the undercards of my brother\u2019s famous bouts. Not many people know this. I had always followed him since we were little kids and everything he did, everywhere he went, everyone e met you would find me there with him. Of course, I left all the talking to him. Boy, he could talk! I met presidents, world leaders, movie stars, music stars, sports stars, you name it.\n\nQ: What was he like to train with? As I understand, you were his best sparring partner?\n\nRahaman Ali: Muhammad and I sparred ever since we took up boxing when we were boys. And so I was able to learn of his bad habits and strengths more so than anyone else who ever got to spar or fight him. However, he never wanted to fight me, though. Not in a boxing fight. And the reason behind this was he loved me more than anyone and would always be protective of me. I was the one who was known in our camp as the \u201cprotector\u201d of Muhammad Ali. I was actually his unofficial bodyguard. Back in the 1960s because of the issues in our country and the fact my brother was in the spotlight a lot of people in America started to dislike him. He took on the American Government, the establishment, and made enemies. He did get death threats back in the days. Fortunately nothing materialized. It was hard times and it kept me on my toes because I was responsible for his safety.\n\nQ: Your brother fought some of the best fighters of all time. Do you think he would hold his own if he boxed in the modern era of today with the likes of Deontay Wilder or Anthony Joshua?\n\nRahaman Ali: Muhammad fought giants George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Ken Norton. He could take a punch and he was never a quitter. Hi speed was phenomenal. Ernie Shavers, who is regarded as the hardest hitters of all-time in the heavyweight division, gave my brother a very hard fight. I was there ringside. Ernie hit him so hard it hurt him, But Muhammad was never going to quit and I knew it. He always believed in prevailing. I remember Sylvester Stallone came into the dressing room and fooled around with Muhammad. Sly had just been catapulted to fame with his Rocky movie and was a big boxing fan He still is. In fact, in my book My Brother, Muhammad Ali, I talk about their relationship including a never-before-told story. Sly admired my brother and my brother also admired Sly because of his perseverance. To answer your question, Muhammad would\u2019ve ruled the ring in any era.\n\nQ: Speaking of the book, which is the definitive biography, what can the reader learn because the Muhammad Ali story has been told many times now?\n\nRahaman Ali: I was one human who knew Muhammad Ali more than anyone. Not only did we grow up together and I was his closest family member, but I was literally stuck like glue to him throughout his career. I was able to witness the happy times, and the sad times, the hurdles he had overcome, the death threats and racist abuse that he had to endure. I saw my brother develop into this magnificent personality that made him one of the most popular people around the globe. I had seen biographers who had churned out books on my brother, but none really knew him personally, at least not to the extent that a close family member like myself did. I felt it was imperative I tell the Muhammad Ali story to the world and his fans as his legacy will continue. I also wanted to tell rare and never-before-told stories as well as give my perspective on the all too familiar ones. There\u2019s always been some misunderstanding or untrue stories about my brother. For example, did he really throw the Olympic gold medal in the river or was it made up? Well, I was the only person in the world that can clear this up because I was the only person with him that day. And I unravel the mystery. See, there\u2019s nothing better than going to the source direct instead of relying on second hand information. And it was my attempt to do this in the book once and for all.\n\nQ: What sets Muhammad apart from others in his sport?\n\nRahaman Ali: The great thing about my brother is that he transcends sport. His appeal goes beyond the confines of the boxing. And people from all walks of life are able to resonate with him. He had this aura about him that uplifted you in his presence. And believe me, those who had the good fortune to meet him, they went away with a great feeling. We all know he was a celebrity, but it was important for him to treat every human the same.\n\nQ: Do you think there\u2019s a side to Muhammad Ali that the fans are unaware of or anything that you felt was important to highlight?\n\nRahaman Ali: One of the biggest misconception is that my brother was this loud, brash, arrogant man who loved publicity. That\u2019s partly true. Yes, he enjoyed the circus and the publicity and honed this persona. However, behind this confident and larger than life persona there was the Muhammad Ali that only his family knew. Only his close friends knew. And I wanted to gravitate towards the Ali personality that most people are unaware of. How did he spend time with his kids? How did he spend time with his parents and brother growing up? How did he spend time at home with his wife away from the cameras? How did he treat his guests at his home behind closed doors whether it was a house party or a random get together? How did his own brother try to protect him from all the scammers and fraudsters that wanted to get their dirty hands on his cash? And, of course, the ringside stories which I wanted to share with the fans because of the unique position I was part of the close-knit inner circle. So, yes, there were plenty of areas that I felt needed to be highlighted with some revelations too.\n\nQ: Any boxers you think Muhammad would admire today?\n\nRahaman Ali: I think Tyson Fury has a personality. He likes to entertain. And he brings something extra onto the table. Right now, I can see Fury stepping up his game. Look at him, he\u2019s throwing himself right into it with face-offs and really trying to get the attention in America. As long as he keeps winning I feel Bob Arum will make him into a big star here just like he already is in the UK.\n\n\u201cMy Brother, Muhammad Ali: The Definitive Biography\u201d by Rahaman Ali is now available in the UK from all bookstores nationwide and on Amazon.", "description": "Q: Muhammad Ali seems to have a large following in the UK.
