He lowered his AL-leading ERA to 2.50 and his 283 strikeouts this season leave him 11 shy of becoming the 18th player in MLB history to reach 3,000.\n\nHe\u2019s one win away from reaching 20 for the second time in his career and the first time since winning a career-high 24 games in 2011 when he was voted AL MVP and Cy Young winner.\n\nManager AJ Hinch was asked to describe Verlander\u2019s season.\n\n\u201cWe need an hour of conversation to talk about his season,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cHe\u2019s so super focused on the days that he pitches. He executes his game plan and it\u2019s a sight to see.\u201d\n\nRoberto Osuna struck out two in the ninth for his 34th save.\n\nTexas starter Lance Lynn (14-11) was tough early and the Astros had just one hit before Gurriel\u2019s home run to the first row of the seats in right field with one out in the fifth.\n\nThere were two outs in the sixth when Bregman launched his homer onto the train tracks atop left field to give him 37 this season. It\u2019s the most home runs by an Astro since Chris Carter also had 37 in 2014.\n\nBregman wasn\u2019t interested in talking about the season he\u2019s put together so far.\n\n\u201cI just show up and try to help the team win games,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the reason all of us play the game of baseball is to win, and that\u2019s what drives all of us, and that\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d\n\nHouston went back-to-back when Alvarez extended his rookie franchise record with his 26th homer on a ball hit to straightaway center field to make it 3-0.\n\n\u201cLance did a great job, like he always does,\u201d Texas manager Chris Woodward said. \u201cBut that lineup over there, if you make one mistake they make you pay.\u201d\n\nNomar Mazara had two hits, including a solo home run off Hector Rondon in the seventh inning as the Rangers dropped their fourth game overall and the sixth straight to the Astros.\n\nLynn yielded seven hits and four runs with eight strikeouts in seven innings. He is 0-5 in his last eight starts behind an offense that hasn\u2019t provided much run support. The Rangers haven\u2019t scored more than three runs in one of his starts since his last win on Aug. 2.\n\nJose Altuve singled with one out in the first inning before Lynn settled in, retiring the next 12 batters, with six strikeouts before Gurriel\u2019s homer.\n\nHouston shortstop Carlos Correa went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts in his return after sitting out since Aug. 19 with a sore lower back.\n\nThe Astros tacked on a run in the seventh inning when Robinson Chirinos tripled and scored on a single by George Springer.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRangers: OF Joey Gallo (wrist surgery) is working out and playing in games at the Rangers instructional league in Arizona and could come off the injured list by the end of the week.\n\nAstros: Correa was only able to get one rehabilitation game in at Triple-A Round Rock before the team\u2019s season ended, so the Astros will ease him back into playing every day. Hinch said he\u2019ll be off on Wednesday to give him two days off coupled with an off day on Thursday and that he\u2019ll likely only play two of three games this weekend against the Angels. \u2026 RHP Brad Peacock (sore shoulder) threw a bullpen session on Monday and is scheduled to throw live batting practice on Thursday as he moves closer to coming off the injured list.\n\n150\n\nOsuna, who is 24, reached 150 saves on Tuesday to make him the youngest pitcher in MLB history to reach the mark, passing Craig Kimbrel, who did it at 25. Osuna\u2019s 34 saves are tied for second-most in the AL and eighth in a season in franchise history.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRangers: LHP Kolby Allard (4-0, 4.34) will start for Texas on Wednesday night. The rookie allowed seven hits and four runs in four innings in his last start but did not factor in the decision in a 6-4 win over Tampa Bay.\n\nAstros: RHP Gerrit Cole (17-5, 2.62), who leads the majors with 292 strikeouts, is scheduled to start for Houston on Wednesday. Cole allowed four hits and one run while striking out 11 as he pitched a season-high eight innings for the second straight start in a 4-1 win over Kansas City the last time out.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Justin Verlander is approaching some important personal milestones.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/rangers_astros_baseball_78196_c0-1364-3288-3281_s1770x1032.jpg?2e5b1ea124b91f0a4c63fcff821cb44d4b77129c", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
