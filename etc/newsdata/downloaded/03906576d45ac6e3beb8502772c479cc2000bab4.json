'They have quality and they are in a situation they don't want to be in.'\n\nFortunately, Wijnaldum is set to be recalled after a disappointing week that saw him substituted at Old Trafford against Manchester United and then given only the final 16 minutes in the Champions League against Genk.\n\nKlopp reckons the 28-year-old Dutch midfielder almost takes his game to a new level if he receives setbacks.\n\n'Character is what makes you the person you are. He (Wijnaldum) doesn't really knock on my door but it's normal there are things he wouldn't like, that is normal.\n\n'The perfect reaction was when I didn't start him against Barcelona at home and he came on and scored two goals. He used the anger or whatever.\n\n'Afterwards I congratulated him and he replied: 'Yes, but that's because you didn't let me out.\" I said: 'So, who is right now?!\"\n\nWijnaldum had to be content with a place from the bench during the Genk game midweek\n\n'Gini speaks on the pitch for the way he plays. It is just so obvious his importance. It is both directions, small spaces, big spaces, it is hard challenges, fine football, pretty much all of that.\n\n'From the skillset 100% he is the perfect midfielder. He has all the things you need. There was his header against Barcelona too. He is not the tallest, but he is good in the air. He is a good jumper with good timing, all that stuff. It all makes him a pretty good footballer.\n\nThat is how it should be. It is not my fault if he goes under the radar. You cannot ask me why he goes under the radar. I don\u2019t set the radar! But he is a presence, he is not the guy who just says Yes to everything.'\n\nIt underlines the incredible standards at the top of the Premier League that having won 17 league games in a row, Liverpool will start to feel the pressure if they fail to take three points for the second weekend in a row. Manchester City are formidable rivals so every result counts.\n\nLiverpool won the tactical battle in Madrid in May and Klopp, who admits having watched the celebrations back more than the game itself, said the final showed his team is maturing fast.\n\nWijnaldum replaced Oxlade-Chamberlain in the Champions League fixture, seen in training\n\n'I\u2019ve learnt that playing a final is not about playing the best football of your life but about winning. In nearly all of the finals I have played with my team as a manager, we performed better but didn\u2019t win,' he admits.\n\n'This was a final where we were really mature, scored an early goal, defended them exceptionally well and then scored a second goal. That is the maturity we needed to be a champion and we had to learn that. Now we did it and it\u2019s all good.\n\n'There are specific ways to play a football game but the boys are not like machines. They don\u2019t have five different ways and you just push a button and they play way one or another. You have to develop and that is what the boys have done.'\n\nKlopp will try to treat this afternoon's encounter like another final. 'If we prepare 100 per cent, where is the space to prepare more?' he smiles. 'When we played Tottenham last year (in the Premier League) it felt at that moment as if it was the most important game of the year.\n\n'We had to win all the games and we had to beat Tottenham at home. We were really good at the beginning then we were not that good in the middle then we came up again and scored the goal.'\n\nKlopp is prepared to get feisty as the title race countdown starts to tick - and we are still only at the end of October. Liverpool fans have waited 30 seasons to be champions of England and their manager is aware all the focus will be on his team.\n\n'After the United game (1-1), everybody spoke about us not playing well and nobody spoke about United,' he rapped. 'But it was a draw and we had to explain how we played. That is the way it is but that is the media's job, not mine.'", "description": "Wijnaldum is set to be recalled after a disappointing week that saw him substituted at Old Trafford against Manchester United and then given only the final 16 minutes against Genk.", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/21/20225120-0-image-a-51_1572120662018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
