He will collect one half of the 9-million kronor (\u00a3740,000) award.\n\n\u2018Much of it will go to charity,\u2019 Peebles told colleagues at a Princeton news conference.\n\nThen after a pause, he changed his mind and added: \u2018Some of it will go to charity. Some of it will go to our children.\u2019\n\nMayor, who is an astrophysicist, and Queloz, an astronomer who is also at the University of Cambridge in Britain, will share the other half. Their finding of the first planet outside our solar system circling a star like our own made astronomers look harder for life elsewhere in the universe.\n\n\u2018Maybe we can discover some form of life. We don\u2019t know what kind of form,\u2019 Mayor said on Tuesday as he arrived in Madrid for a scientific speaking engagement.\n\nHe said scientists \u2018are absolutely certain that a lot of these planets have good conditions for life\u2019.\n\nMayor and Queloz started a revolution in astronomy when they discovered 51 Pegasi B, a gaseous ball comparable with Jupiter, in 1995 \u2013 a time when, as Mayor recalled, \u2018no one knew whether exoplanets existed or not\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 4,000 exoplanets have since been found in the Milky Way, and scientists think one out of every four or five stars have planets.\n\nQueloz was meeting with other academics interested in finding new planets when the press office at Cambridge University told him he had won the Nobel. He thought it was a joke at first.\n\n\u2018I could barely breathe,\u2019 Queloz said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s enormous. It\u2019s beyond usual emotions. My hand was shaking for a long time. I\u2019m trying to digest it.\u2019\n\nPeebles\u2019 work, which began in the mid-1960s, set the stage for a \u201ctransformation\u201d of cosmology over the last half-century, using theoretical tools and calculations that helped interpret traces from the infancy of the universe, the Nobel committee said.\n\nOn Monday, Americans William G. Kaelin Jr. and Gregg L. Semenza and Britain\u2019s Peter J. Ratcliffe won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, for discovering details of how the body\u2019s cells sense and react to low oxygen levels, providing a foothold for developing new treatments for anaemia, cancer and other diseases.\n\nNobel, a Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite, decided the physics, chemistry, medicine and literature prizes should be awarded in Stockholm and the peace prize in Oslo.\n\nThe Nobel Prize for Chemistry will be announced Wednesday, two Literature Prizes will be awarded on Thursday, and the Peace Prize comes Friday.", "description": "Prestigious award granted to researchers who grappled with the biggest questions in the universe.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89025374_1570612463.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
