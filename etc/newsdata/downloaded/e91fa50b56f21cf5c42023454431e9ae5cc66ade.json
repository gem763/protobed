(We all know, of course, that good men can \u2014 and like all kinds of men, usually do \u2014 produce bad art.)\n\nThe Nobel committee that has awarded Austrian playwright Peter Handke the Literature Nobel this year \u2014 along with Poland\u2019s Olga Tokarczuk belatedly for the 2018 award \u2014 certainly seem to think so.\n\nThe quality of Handke\u2019s works \u2014 his 1966 play Publikumsbeschimpfung (Offending the Audience) being quite representative of his practice of ring-fencing the world of theatre (read: art) from the world outside \u2014 hasn\u2019t been brought to question even by those criticising the choice.\n\nWhat has troubled some critics is that he is not just a public sympathiser of the late Yugoslavian and Serbian war criminal Slobodan Milo\u0161evic (Handke attended Milo\u0161evic \u2019s funeral in 2006), but also publicly stated that Sarajevo\u2019s Muslims had \u2018massacred themselves\u2019 to apparently blame the Serbs of genocide during the Balkan War in the 1990s \u2014 a notion that is as fantastic as it is disgusting.\n\nThe problem, of course, lies in our idea of what an award like the Nobel Prize is \u2014 ironically a \u2018good\u2019 prize set up by the inventor of a \u2018bad\u2019 entity like dynamite, and owner, during his own lifetime, of the weapons manufacturer Bofors.\n\nOne of the staunchest critics of the Nobel giving the award to Handke, writer Salman Rushdie, himself knows what it means to be considered a \u2018bad man and, therefore, by extension, a bad writer\u2019.\n\nHis 1988 novel The Satanic Verses was not allowed to be printed in India by the Rajiv Gandhi government, as it was considered by enough thin-skinned, loudmouths to be denigrating Islam. This prohibition in India subsequently leading to the fatwa on February 14, 1989, from Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Khomeini, which actually called for the writer\u2019s death.\n\nMuch of the so-called \u2018liberal\u2019 criticism to this day against Rushdie\u2019s book has been not about it being \u2018blasphemous\u2019, of course. Liberals lurrv blasphemy, and I certainly do.\n\nIt remains a \u2018bad book\u2019 because it was apparently a \u2018bad novel\u2019 \u2014 a convenient piggyback ride and liberal sleight-of-hand that conflates \u2018bad art\u2019 with a perceived \u2018bad man\u2019.\n\nThis conflation has been around for a long time, with noted examples like the disturbing prospect of having to deal with the stunning images from Nazi propaganda filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s 1935 Triumph of the Will and 1938 Olympia; or, Soviet cinema grandmaster Sergei Eisenstein\u2019s propaganda 1928 film, October, and the glorious 1944 epic, Ivan the Terrible, Part 1, a personal favourite of Josef Stalin and mine.\n\nThese are great art that makes liberal purveyors of the liberal arts uncomfortable \u2014 the sort of thing that, coming from the other end of the ideological and aesthetic spectrum, \u2018outrages\u2019 conservatives, who usually have the luxury of demanding that these blasphemous/sentimentshurting/anti-national/anti-community (choose your poison)\u2026 works be banned or, even better, destroyed Bamyan Buddha-style.\n\nThis is not to stretch moral or aesthetic relativism to a ludicrous extreme. After all, Handke\u2019s support of the architect of an established genocide cannot be put at par with, say, Rushdie\u2019s \u2018poetic licence\u2019.\n\nBut whether it\u2019s the confusion of retrospectively finding moral and ethical faults with great writers like Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay (for being an inspiration much later to the Hindu Right for his 1882 novel Anandamath, famously the source of the \u2018lyrics\u2019 of \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019), or great composers like the genuinely antisemitic Richard Wagner (for inspiring Germany\u2019s Nazi Party\u2019s racist ideology decades later), or great singer-songwriters like Steven Morrissey (whose anti-immigrant and pro-Brexit stand has become loud enough for admirers to press the pause button even when playing back catalogues) \u2014or contemporary \u2018good writers, with bad values\u2019 like the American poet Ezra Pound, who was an open sympathiser of fascism, and Handke himself\u2026 it is tough to separate the man and his artistic works, something that the Nobel Committee may, in its utter devotion to aesthetic objectivity, may have managed.\n\nPerhaps what is being judged is not so much the Nobel laureate but the Nobel Prize itself. Remember, the 1953 Nobel Prize in Literature went to Winston Churchill, who only 10 years before was the architect of the 1943 Bengal famine that saw some three million Indians perish because of his decision to refuse emergency food supplies be diverted to starving Indians from stockpiles for already well-supplied Allied troops in Greece and Yugoslavia.\n\nThe only way, perhaps, to deal with the discomfort of some of the \u2018poor\u2019 choices made by this recognised and still-prestigious award that is the Nobel is to take it less seriously. Especially at a time when awards and recognitions have proliferated enough for one to tip one\u2019s hat at some choices, and give the cold shoulder to the more \u2018problematic ones\u2019.", "description": "Frankly, it\u2019s the oldest question among those who judge art and measure men: can a bad man produce good art?
