(Justin Pennell/CBC)\n\nOrganized by Elections Canada and CIVIX, the learning program, now in its sixth year, provides elementary and high school students the opportunity to experience the voting process firsthand.\n\nCIVIX is a non-partisan, national charity that\u2019s dedicated to \u201cbuilding the skills and habits of engaged citizenship among young Canadians.\u201d\n\nThese Grade 12 Social Studies students at Central Memorial High School in Calgary are learning about democracy through a mock election. (Justin Pennell/CBC)\n\nMore than a million students in 9,500 schools participate in Student Vote, where they learn about government and the electoral process, engage in the campaign and cast ballots for the official local candidates.\n\n\u201cThey are all the next generation of future voters,\u201d Nicole said. \u201cIt matters that ... they have a say.\u201d\n\nNicole Miller is the NDP candidate for her school\u2019s mock federal election vote for Student Vote Canada 2019. (Submitted by Nicole Cameron)\n\nAs part of the program, Nicole organized a mock debate at her school.\n\n\u201cI think a mock debate can really help kids understand the issues on a more relatable level,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to listen to your classmates talk about these issues, and either agree or disagree,\u201d Nicole said.\n\nFrom left to right, Kaitlyn Miller, Ayden Jefferey Wilkins, Grace Van Bakel, Nicole Miller and Josh Hart mock debating for Student Vote Canada 2019. (Submitted by Nicole Cameron)\n\nEducation and the economy are some of the issues important to students at her school, but climate change is at the top.\n\n\u201cI am pro oil sands, which is a fairly controversial opinion for many students and people, especially in Alberta,\u201d Nicole said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying climate change doesn\u2019t exist, because it does. We should look at long-term solutions,\" she said.\n\n\"If we shut down the oil sands and the world is saved ... the need for fossil fuels is still going to be there.\u201d\n\nAyden Jefferey Wilkins represents the People\u2019s Party of Canada in Central Memorial High School\u2019s mock debate.
