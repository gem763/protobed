She, however, sees it in a different way.\n\nThe tweet posted by the Lahore-based singer on Tuesday drew quite some attention on the social media, with commenters rushing to state that she gave a vivid example of how Pakistan is a hotbed of terrorism, unlike its eastern neighbor.\n\n\u201cWow!! You looking awesome in traditional Pakistani dress,\u201d one commenter said, while another one ranted: \u201cThreatening suicide bombing to Modi on Twitter, Pakistanis are literally a gone case.\u201d\n\nThe photo propagated further, with angry and sarcastic remarks along the \u2018traditional vest\u2019 lines.\n\nHours later Peerzada responded to her critics, saying the image came from a video, where she condemns suicide attacks.\n\n\u201cI wish peace and humanity and all those Indians giving me lectures on Modi safety. Can you justify 3 months of curfew without food and medicines? I posted it to remind u stop this cruelty against IOK,\u201d she said, referring to the Indian-controlled part of the disputed region of Kashmir. She later deleted the original provocative post.\n\nThe Indian government stripped the predominantly Muslim region under its control of its decades-old autonomy in August and imposed strict security measures in expectation of public outrage by the local population. Peerzada is one of many Pakistanis, who have been vocally protesting the development.\n\nInterestingly, the suicide vest photo was shared on her twitter account earlier on Monday with a caption in Urdu, which warned that a failure of the UN to mediate the Kashmir conflict would lead to a spike of terrorism. That post, however, didn\u2019t go viral.\n\n\u0627\u062e\u0631 \u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u06a9\u0634\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u06c1\u0646 \u0628\u06be\u0627\u0626\u06cc \u06a9\u06cc\u0633\u0627\u062a\u06be \u0627\u06cc\u06a9 \u06cc\u06c1\u06cc \u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u06c1 \u06c1\u0648\u06af\u0627 \u06d4\u062c\u0628 \u0627\u0642\u0648\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u06c1 \u062b\u0627\u0644\u062b\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0641\u06cc\u0644 \u06c1\u0648\u06af\u0627\u06d4 pic.twitter.com/ZnHQj35HE3 \u2014 Rabi Pirzada Bodyguard (@FunRabi) October 21, 2019\n\nEarlier this month Indian social media users accused Pakistan of brainwashing children into joining the ranks of terrorists after an Islamist student\u2019s body released a controversial video, in which children shared their dreams, including to \u201cavenge the death of every single Muslim\u201d by pro-Indian forces.\n\nAlso on rt.com Islamabad accused of brainwashing kids over student body\u2019s VIDEO on how \u2018Hind will become Pakistan\u2019\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
