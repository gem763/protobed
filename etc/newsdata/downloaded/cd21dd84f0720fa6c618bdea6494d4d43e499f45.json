The weekly tuition-free class, in a roomy space that Ralph Nader and his Public Citizen nonprofit group provided, was discussion-based and required no useless drudgeries like homework or exams. Just come in and figure out how to increase peace and decrease violence. And do it today, tomorrow is too late. The course attracted mostly congressional interns, with a few exceptions like Kelli who was in Washington as an AmeriCorps volunteer.\n\nHer year-long service included comforting HIV/AIDs patients at a free health clinic and following up with the solace of delivering meals to the homebound. It was a world apart from her undergraduate days at the University of California at Berkeley and majoring in political science. The Washington experience, which Kelli would later call \u201ctransformative,\u201d was the fuel that carried her into medicine to earn a master\u2019s degree in public health from Columbia University and a medical degree from the University of Rochester, and almost two decades of practice as an emergency room psychiatrist at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\n\nKelli\u2019s letter, a literate update on both her personal and professional life, touched my heart, and especially so when saying that two decades later she still has the course text, \u201cSolutions to Violence,\u201d and that \u201cit remains one of my favorite possessions.\u201d She lives in Lower Manhattan with her husband, Padraic, whom she met on a flight to London, and their three boys.\n\nIf Kelli stands out, it\u2019s because like physicians William Carlos Williams, Robert Coles, Walker Percy and Atul Gawande, she is also a writer \u2014 a gifted one. Last month, Atria Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published her book \u201cThe Rabbit Effect: Live Longer, Happier, and Healthier With the Groundbreaking Science of Kindness.\u201d\n\nWith a blending of free-flowing confessional prose and scholarly research found in 461 notes, Kelli met my expectations that her ideas and ideals would be sound and singular. \u201cDespite our scientific progress,\u201d she writes, \u201cAmericans are remarkably unhealthy. In 2016, the United States ranked forty-third in the world for life expectancy. . . . It is also by far the world\u2019s most expensive place to get sick.\u201d\n\n\n\nAuthor Kelli Harding (Agaton Strom)\n\nEnter the rabbits \u2014 not those bunnies scampering in our woodlands but ones serving in two month-long medical experiments to test the effects of eating a high-fat diet and the connections between cholesterol and heart disease. With similar diets, the expectations were that all the rabbits would have similar cloggings of their arteries. Yet one group had 60 percent fewer of them.\n\nThe reason? Instead of receiving the standard care given to lab animals, the 60 percent group was watched over by a newcomer to the lab who, Kelli writes, \u201chandled the animals differently. When she fed her rabbits she talked to them, cuddled and petted them. She didn\u2019t just pass out kibble, she gave them love. . . . The studies indicate something is missing in the traditional biomedical model. It wasn\u2019t diet or genetics that made a difference in which rabbits got sick and which stayed healthy. It was kindness.\u201d\n\nAmid the clanging political noise about Obamacare, Medicare, Medicaid, health insurance and thieving pharmaceutical companies, Kelli Harding stands apart from the horde calling for quick fixes, the simpler the better. She has walked too many miles in the halls of hospitals visiting too many far-gone patients and seeing too many medical mistakes to go along with conventional thinking.\n\n\u201cThe rabbit effect,\u201d she explains, means that \u201cwhen it comes to our health, we\u2019ve been missing some crucial pieces: hidden factors behind what really makes us healthy. Factors like love, friendship, and dignity. The designs of our neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces. There\u2019s a social dimension to health that we\u2019ve completely overlooked in our scramble to find the best and most cutting-edge medical care. . . . Ultimately, what affects our health in the most meaningful ways has as much to do with how we treat one another, how we live, and how we think about what it means to be human than with anything that happens in the doctor\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nIn more than a few passages, she relates the stories of men and women who came up against assembly-line medicine where patients were treated mostly as pieces of flesh.\n\n\u201cClinically,\u201d she writes, \u201cit\u2019s common to see two patients with the same condition, such as recovering from a heart attack, have two very different courses based on seemingly irrelevant factors, such as their family relationships or their educational level. In my practice, the sickest people I see often share similar backgrounds: loneliness, abuse, poverty, or discrimination. For them, the medical model isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s like fixing up an airplane engine and ignoring that the pilot is on his third drink at the bar and a massive storm is overhead. . . . To properly care for patients, we also need to care about the lives of the people getting the care.\u201d\n\nKelli wastes no time taking cheap shots or potshots at the medical establishment and its body-centered biomedicine methods.\n\nInstead, she remains positive, holding up for praise one of her medical school professors, George Engel, an internist \u201cwho always noticed not just a patient\u2019s physical findings but little details about her life, such as if she had family pictures up in her hospital room or flowers delivered. He was the kind of trusted doctor you\u2019d feel relieved to see and welcome into the room with a sick family member. He\u2019d sit down to talk with the person not just about medical problems, but about her life and priorities. He built a large consultation service to address the holistic needs of hospitalized patients, including psychological and social factors.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a guess how many George Engels in their white jackets and stethoscopes are at work these days and another speculation on the number of Kelli Hardings the nation is blessed with. Please, dear God, may the totals be large and getting larger.\n\nColman McCarthy, a former Washington Post editorial writer and columnist, directs the Center for Teaching Peace, a Washington-based nonprofit group.
