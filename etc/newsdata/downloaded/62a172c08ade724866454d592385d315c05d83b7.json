But he conveys the same gist by arguing that any attempt by Democrats to impeach Trump would be illegitimate and unconstitutional. To that end, Cipollone raises a series of procedural complaints about the Democrats\u2019 approach to impeachment. Rather than negotiate with the House about that process, he tries to dictate how it should conduct Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cTo comply with the Constitution\u2019s demands, appropriate procedures would include\u2014at a minimum\u2014the right to see all evidence, to present evidence, to call witnesses, to have counsel present at all hearings, to cross-examine all witnesses, to make objections relating to the examination of witnesses or the admissibility of testimony and evidence, and to respond to evidence and testimony,\u201d the letter states. \u201cLikewise, the Committees must provide for the disclosure of all evidence favorable to the President and all evidence bearing on the credibility of witnesses called to testify in the inquiry.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading, to say the least. The House\u2019s role in the impeachment is analogous to that of a grand jury. Pelosi and Adam Schiff are not the president\u2019s judges; they are his prosecutors. Trump will have plenty of opportunities to defend himself\u2014to offer evidence, to call their own witnesses, to cross-examine the House\u2019s witnesses, and more\u2014if he goes on trial before the Senate. Whether Cipollone\u2019s assertion comes from deception or incompetence is unclear. \u201cIt\u2019s as though the White House is unfamiliar with the difference between impeachment in the House and trial in the Senate,\u201d Michigan Representative Justin Amash quipped on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s also as though the White House is unfamiliar with the Constitution generally.\u201d\n\nCipollone\u2019s claims that the president is being denied due process also ring as disingenuous after events earlier in the day. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, was scheduled to make a voluntary appearance before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday morning to answer questions about his involvement. Interest in Sondland\u2019s role in the Ukraine scandal grew last week after House investigators released text messages between him and Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine at the time.\n\n\u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Taylor asked him on September 1. \u201cCall me,\u201d Sondland immediately replied. On September 9, Taylor raised more concerns about the hold on military aid. \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d he wrote. Five hours later, Sondland replied. \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d Sondland then asked Taylor to communicate by phone instead of text messages.\n\n", "description": "Tuesday\u2019s scorched-earth letter to the House uses defiance to mask its self-inflicted defeats.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/271cfa814d606b017b5196327457a20e181b88e1.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
