How dairy you?! Italy wants to reclaim its cheese.\n\n\u201cMy gesture was all about tariffs,\u201d Martinelli said in a phone call with The Post on Tuesday evening.\n\nAD\n\nShe packed the cheese in her bag ahead of the photo op Tuesday, she said, along with her black suit \u2014 the signature outfit of \u201cLe Iene\u2019s\u201d comedic reporters. She even passed through an X-ray machine on her way into the event, but the cheese didn\u2019t set off any red flags \u2014 that is, until she was close to Pompeo, handing it directly to him.\n\nAD\n\nAnd she seemed to think that on Pompeo\u2019s end, at least, her message was well received.\n\n\u201cHe actually seemed very happy about it \u2014 he was laughing the whole time,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for Conte? He made a bit of a stink.\n\nHe grabbed the 30-month-old cheese from Pompeo and handed it off to an aide. \u201cLet me explain, this is the way to prove you\u2019re Italian,\u201d he said, as Pompeo giggled in the background. \u201cLet me do the work of the president of the council. \u2026 You, step outside,\u201d he called after Martinelli in Italian.\n\nAD\n\nThen he made a quick recovery as he turned back to Pompeo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good one,\u201d he said, pointing toward the cheese.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt,\u201d Pompeo replied, patting his stomach as the two shared a laugh.\n\nRead more:\n\nItaly offers migrant ship passage to island port, softening its closed-door policy\n\nHow an obscure law professor outmaneuvered Italy\u2019s Trump to become prime minister twice\n\nHe was Europe\u2019s fastest-rising politician.
