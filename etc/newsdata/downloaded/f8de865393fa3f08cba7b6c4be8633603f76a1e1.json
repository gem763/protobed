It\u2019s an insult to the United States, and I don\u2019t really give a damn about a single investment banker in this country having open access to China,\u201d Dobbs said in an exchange with Pillsbury on his program Tuesday night.\n\nThe harsh criticism came on the heels of last week\u2019s announcement of a so-called phase one deal in which China agreed to ramp up its purchases of U.S. agricultural products by as much as $50 billion annually, further open its market to U.S. financial services firms and increase some intellectual property protections.\n\nThe U.S. suspended a tariff increase scheduled to take place Tuesday, and officials left open the possibility that a Dec. 15 round of tariffs hitting laptops, smartphones and other consumer goods could be halted as well.\n\nThe tariff deescalation comes even as China continues to balk at U.S. demands that sparked the tariff fight more than a year ago. That includes actions the U.S. side says provide unfair subsidies to Chinese domestic firms, improperly control data flows and force U.S. companies into joint ventures that require them to hand over technology in order to do business in the lucrative Chinese market.\n\nTrump on Wednesday said the agreement is still being \u201cpapered\u201d \u2014 meaning that the details have yet to be written down.\n\nStill, he highlighted what the deal could do for U.S. bankers and farmers as \u201cincredible\u201d and \u201cfar greater than anyone ever thought.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s enthusiasm for what was broadly announced last week does little to conceal the major questions remaining about implementation and China honoring its commitments.\n\nThe Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group that has helped advise Trump on his trade policy, said it was wary.\n\n\u201cHardliners in Beijing have not yet agreed to terms, and they may yet reject this deal \u2014 just as they did last May,\u201d Dan DiMicco, a former Nucor steel CEO who chairs the organization, said in a statement referring to when the talks broke down earlier this year. Beijing had rejected U.S. demands that it alter its law to reflect certain commitments.\n\nBeijing has not explicitly confirmed that it made a commitment to buy anywhere between $40 billion and $50 billion worth of U.S. farm goods. The country imported roughly $20 billion in 2017 before the tit-for-tat tariff war began.\n\nA spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry this week said the U.S. understanding what was agreed to last week \u201cis true\u201d but provided no details on how Beijing will meet its commitments on agriculture purchases.\n\nThose purchases could end up being less than Trump touted as Chinese negotiators have conditioned any increase in imports on market demand, compliance with international trading rules and the U.S. removing the threat of tariffs in December, said a person briefed on the talks.\n\nHowever, administration officials laid out a process to get China to make sustained annual farm purchases valued between $40 billion and $50 billion, according to another person briefed on the talks.\n\nBeijing will continue to make goodwill purchases between now and when Trump meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile in mid-November. The plan will be for China to scale up to record purchases in 2020. By 2021, Beijing will have removed non-tariff barriers relating to food safety and approvals of genetically modified crops, allowing U.S. agricultural products to surge into China at the level Trump has boasted, the person said.\n\nBut the person said China is only expected to significantly ramp up purchases once the threat of the Dec. 15 round of tariffs is eliminated. Beijing could find new leverage with Trump once it reestablishes itself as a dominant export market for U.S. farm goods.", "description": "President Donald Trump has touted a preliminary agreement with China as a \u201cmassive\u201d deal, but even some of his staunchest supporters aren\u2019t hiding their skepticism.  \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be thrilled,\u201d said Michael Pillsbury, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and outside adviser to Trump.
