He has spent his entire career at Nissan, and graduated from Japan\u2019s National Defense Academy, usually a track into the military.\n\n\u2013 Avoiding \u2018dictatorship\u2019 \u2013\n\nNissan has been undergoing a governance overhaul in the wake of the Ghosn scandal, which saw the tycoon accused of under-reporting compensation and using company funds for personal expenses.\n\nThe decision to name a new COO and vice-COO is intended to create a more open executive structure, experts said.\n\n\u201cThe troika system was introduced to avoid the emergence of dictatorship,\u201d said Koji Endo, a senior analyst at SBI Securities.\n\nBut he warned that the decision could come with downsides.\n\n\u201cThe troika management system may have some weakness when it comes to quick decision-making compared with a system led by a strong leader.\u201d\n\nAnd the team faces enormous challenges. In July the firm posted its worst first-quarter results since the global financial crisis and, while it has cited a global slowdown in the auto sector, Nissan is also suffering from a lack of innovation and reputational damage from the Ghosn scandal.\n\n\u201cThe very first thing the new CEO has to do is to revise down Nisan\u2019s full-year earnings forecast\u2026 and then cut dividends,\u201d Endo said.\n\nThe alliance must also be strengthened, 12,500 job cuts implemented, and the US business turned around, he added.\n\n\u201cIt is a task that normally takes more than a year or two but it has to be fixed quickly.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Nissan\u2019s new chief executive Makoto Uchida is an insider with a global outlook, but he faces an uphill struggle to right the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/23f0e3_nissan-is-struggling-in-wake-carlos-ghosn-scandal-new-nissan-ceo-brings-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
