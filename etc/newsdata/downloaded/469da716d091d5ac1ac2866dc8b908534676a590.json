The announcement confirmed a report by German business newspaper Handelsblatt, which stated that a review of the current draft of security requirements permits Huawei to provide 5G services in Germany.\n\nHandelsblatt also reports that the decision to include Huawei came from the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, due to fears that exclusion would damage the country\u2019s relationship with China.\n\nMerkel\u2019s office, in partnership with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, also removed a clause from a 5G government policy paper that suggested only \u201ctrusted suppliers\u201d should be given access to the network.\n\nThe decision comes after heavy pressure from the U.S. to urge international allies to resist partnerships with Huawei over fears of espionage, fraud, and intellectual property theft. In January, the Justice Department indicted the Chinese firm after allegations of theft and conspiracy.\n\n\u201cThe criminal activity in this indictment goes back ten years and goes all the way to the top of the company,\u201d said former acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker at a press conference announcing the charges.\n\nIn May, President Trump blacklisted Huawei from doing business with American firms.\n\nAustralia, Japan, New Zealand, and other U.S. allies have already moved to block Huawei from accessing their networks, while the U.K. has had a political debate over the inclusion of the company in the wake of the rollout of 5G technology.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Germany will allow Huawei access to its 5G networks despite a U.S. pressure campaign, spearheaded by FCC chairman Ajit Pai, to block the Chinese tech giant from interacting with allies' data networks.\u201cEssentially our approach is as follows: We are not taking a pre-emptive decision to ban any actor", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.5dTa1qF7yZmiXco52p8Dw--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/45793bb24a1d18f1010ab7955be73d42", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
