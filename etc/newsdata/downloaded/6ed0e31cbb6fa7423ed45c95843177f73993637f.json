And then hung [the carcass] on a hook right outside the onion shed and it dripped all afternoon.\u201d\n\nRose, now 55, has myriad stories from a life well travelled. On Sifnos she lived in the onion shed (with the onions and the dead pig). On the Isle of Skye she worked as a hostel manager for a summer (it rained every day). In Surrey, England, she became a paid companion for an elderly lord and lady.\n\n'Give up and go to the pub': Australia's top authors on beating writer's block Read more\n\n\u201cHe taught me about wine and opera,\u201d she says, sipping sparkling water in a smart French restaurant in Sydney, where she is visiting to promote her latest book. \u201cI felt like Pygmalion, quite honestly. I think he was determined that this young woman from the end of the world could be cultivated.\u201d\n\nAnd yet in her writing Rose finds herself returning again and again to Tasmania, the place her family has called home for seven generations. She insists: \u201cThere are so many stories in your local environment that matter and can be told.\u201d\n\nFor her new novel, Bruny, Rose turns her attention to the Tasmanian island of the same name where she holidayed growing up and where she took her children camping and to the beach, just a short ferry ride from her home in Hobart.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Heather Rose: \u2018There\u2019s no doubt that Tasmania is a prized jewel in the world these days because of its isolation.\u2019 Photograph: Peter Mathew\n\n\u201cAs a child it was always so captivating: you drive on, then you cross the channel and it always felt like going to another world,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it was even more remote and even less populated. I think the silence down there really gets to me: there\u2019s no traffic. You can almost hear the stars it\u2019s so quiet.\u201d\n\nBruny, however, is not a quiet novel; it is about explosions and warring political families and conflict. In it, America has an isolationist president; China has become a formidable world power; and Islamic State rules an expanding caliphate. What\u2019s more, the Chinese and Tasmanian governments have invested in a new project, a $2bn bridge connecting Bruny Island to the mainland. The novel opens with a terrorist attack: the bridge has been blown up.\n\nRose designed the plot \u201cas a way to play with an alternative reality. I had no idea that now, in 2019, it would be so very relevant.\u201d She\u2019s talking, of course, about Trump, who might yet see a second term. Then there are the fears over Beijing\u2019s interference in Australia, from data breaches to attempts to influence universities. Not to mention the degradation of nature and the environment for money.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Tasmania is a prized jewel in the world these days because of its isolation, because of its natural resources, because it is a place to escape the craziness of the world,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt more and more people have discovered it since Mona opened up and we get a million tourists a year now. It\u2019s becoming a bit like a Greek island. Many more visitors than locals.\u201d\n\nFor this reason, Rose believes Tasmania\u2019s future \u201cneeds to be very carefully considered\u201d, from \u201ca cap on visitor numbers\u201d in certain areas to a plan for a changing climate.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Allen & Unwin\n\nRose was born in Hobart, and had her first experience of paid writing in the Mercury newspaper when she was just 17. She went on to train as a copywriter \u2013 in the \u201cdays when copywriting was actually a craft\u201d \u2013 and worked for the advertising agency Mattingly & Partners. In 1999 she co-founded an advertising agency, Coo\u2019ee Tasmania, and stepped down as chairman in 2012.\n\nThe discipline of producing copy for demanding clients taught her a critical lesson: always consider her audience. \u201cThe hardest thing with young writers is that they don\u2019t think about their audience. You can write for yourself but you might have a very limited appeal,\u201d says Rose, who teaches part time at the University of Tasmania.\n\nAs the author of eight books, Rose might be someone her students want to listen to. In 2017 her novel The Museum of Modern Love \u2013 the only one of her five adult novels to be set outside Tasmania \u2013 won the prestigious Stella prize and was a bestseller in Australia. It was also the first novel to be launched at Moma in New York, where it is set.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Marina has chosen pain as a vehicle for her creativity. I didn\u2019t choose pain, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been a vehicle for my creativity.\u2019 Photograph: Peter Mathew\n\nThe Museum of Modern Love took 11 years to create as Rose juggled writing between running her advertising agency and her three children. Hardest still was her subject matter: the maverick artist Marina Abramovi\u0107.\n\n\u201cThe pressure, the pressure!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cI had a fictional version of her for the first five years of writing the book. And then I sat with her during The Artist is Present [a performance work at Moma] four times. And on about the third time I thought, \u2018I could never ever fictionalise you. It would do you a disservice. You are far more magnetic and charismatic than I could ever convey.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRose asked Abramovi\u0107 for permission to write a novel about her. To her shock and surprise, the artist said yes. Yet while Rose researched her life meticulously, she made a conscious decision never to interview her. As she reasoned, it was similar to actors who, \u201cwhen they have to play a real person, often don\u2019t meet that person because they don\u2019t want to make a caricature\u201d.\n\nChris Hammer: 'I am a serial killer.

I didn\u2019t choose pain but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been a vehicle for my creativity. While it\u2019s painful \u2013 there have been severe moments where I can\u2019t walk for weeks on end \u2013 when I get lost in my imagination I don\u2019t feel the pain.\u201d\n\nRose isn\u2019t sure what comes after Bruny. She has written 90,000 words of a memoir (the slaughtered pig makes an appearance) but she \u201chasn\u2019t felt quite ready\u201d to share it yet.\n\nFor now, she\u2019s happy living in Hobart (\u201cI\u2019m a writer, I\u2019m a recluse by nature \u2013 I can live very, very quietly in Tasmania\u201d) and trying her hand at something new: oil painting, a discipline that provides relief from the ideas swirling in her head: \u201cThe best thing about painting for me is that all the words stop: my mind goes completely blank.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Bruny by Heather Rose is out now through Allen & Unwin", "description": "The Stella prize-winning novelist who chronicled the life of Marina Abramovi\u0107 talks about battling chronic illness and her explosive new novel", "authors": ["Clarissa Sebag-Montefiore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a181942c337420b7a72141916ca6729ed791dc9/0_626_3559_2136/master/3559.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=462ffa018176f9cb9580bffe90897ddd", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
