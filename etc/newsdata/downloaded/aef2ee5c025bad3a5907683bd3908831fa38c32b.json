He accused Democrats of \"purporting simply to proceed on the basis of a news conference.\"\n\nDemocrats say that no formal House vote is needed because the impeachment process is in its earliest stages, equivalent to gathering evidence for an indictment. Only then would the Democrats call for a vote on whether to impeach, passing the matter on to the Republican-controlled Senate for a trial.\n\nThe decision means no members of the Trump administration will be authorized to testify in Congress and will ignore subpoenas, the official said.\n\nHe insisted that the White House was \"definitely avoiding saying there's no way we'd ever cooperate.\" However, he gave no explanation of how a change might come.\n\nThe letter had been awaited for several days as part of Mr Trump's strategy of stonewalling investigators and focusing on undermining the credibility of Democratic leaders with his voter base.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the White House prevented the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, from showing up to testify.\n\n\"He would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court,\" Mr Trump said on Twitter.\n\nIn slightly more measured terms, the letter asks Democrats to drop the entire process.\n\n\"We hope that, in light of the many deficiencies we have identified in your proceedings, you will abandon the current invalid efforts to pursue an impeachment inquiry and join the President in focusing on the many important goals that matter to the American people,\" it said.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] The White House slammed the door in a letter on Tuesday on any cooperation by President Donald Trump's administration with the Democrats' impeachment probe, calling it \"constitutionally invalid.\" .
