Relative to Apple, the publicly available data shows that we are adding roughly twice as many subscribers per month as they are,' wrote the company in a letter.\n\n'Additionally, we believe that our monthly engagement is roughly 2x as high and our churn is at half the rate.'\n\nSpotify is Apple's biggest competitor in the space and has bought up many popular podcasting companies in the past two years\n\nThe Swedish company, which has outstripped Apple Music in the race to dominate music streaming globally, said its number of premium subscribers rose by 26 million in the past year to 113 million at the end of September.\n\nAmong the key factors behind its growth are a major uptick in the number of users listening to podcasts, according to the company.\n\nIn the past three months alone, Spotify says it's witnessed a 39 percent increase in the number of users listening to podcasts with the US market leading the way.\n\nSpotify has invested heavily into podcasts throughout the last several years and on Monday, CFO Barry McCarthy told CNBC that the company wants to become the podcast equivalent of Netflix.\n\nApple is diving into the original podcast business according to a new report that says the company is looking to acquire exclusive rights\n\nThe streaming company's growth comes as a surprise after lower-than-expected subscriber growth in the second quarter led to speculation that rivals might be gaining on Spotify, particularly in countries where it faces home-grown competitors.\n\nSpotify, which launched its service over a decade ago, has overcome resistance from large record labels and some major music artists to reshape how people listen to music.\n\nThe world's most popular music streaming service forecast fourth-quarter total premium subscribers of 120 million to 125 million, largely in line with analysts' expectations of 122.6 million.\n\nThe company expects its broader measure of monthly average users to grow to between 255 million and 270 million in the current quarter.", "description": "Among the key factors behind Spotify's growth are a major uptick in the number of users listening to podcasts, according to the company.
