Morgan abandons bullish stance, lowers price target", "language": "en", "text": "Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA, -1.61% dropped 1.9% in morning trading Wednesday, after J.P. Morgan analyst Lisa Gill backed away from her bullish stance on the drug store services company, citing drawn out expectations for profit growth and a continued uncertain outlook. Gill lowered her rating to neutral, after being at overweight for at least the past 2 1/2 years, and cut her 12-month price target to $63 from $73. \"We find it increasingly difficult to support an [overweight] rating with growth taking longer to realize under the current strategy, limited clarity on the roadmap to improvement and few identifiable near-term catalysts,\" Gill wrote in a note to clients. \"Based on our relative rating methodology, we believe there are better opportunities for upside in other companies within our coverage universe at the current time.\" At J.P. Morgan, an overweight rating indicates the analyst believes the stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks the analyst covers. The stock has tumbled 20.6% year to date, making it the worst performer among Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.33% components this year. The Dow has gained 15.0% year to date.", "description": "Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. dropped 1.9% in morning trading Wednesday, after J.P.
