The Cleveland Browns and the New England Patriots have been teams over the past few months linked to Williams, ever since the seven-time Pro Bowler began his holdout in the offseason.\n\nThe Redskins are 1-7 and at the midway point of the season, it would make sense to try and recoup value for a player who doesn\u2019t want to play for them.\n\nAsked about a potential Williams trade Monday, interim coach Bill Callahan said it would be unfair to speculate.\n\nSources: The #Redskins are now open to dealing star LT Trent Williams. They have begun the process of looking at potential suitors, and the #Browns have been one. Unclear how high they set the asking price, but they\u2019ll at least listen. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 28, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
