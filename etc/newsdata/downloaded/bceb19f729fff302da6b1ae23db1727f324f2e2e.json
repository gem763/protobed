The coach has consistently said he would be happy to shuffle that combination depending on the opposition and, having returned to Farrell at 12 in Japan, has shifted him back to 10 to deliver a tough-tackling backline barrier. Part of his thinking has been influenced by the return to fitness of Tuilagi, whose powerful and evasive running he likes to utilize at 12, shifting him over from outside centre.\n\nThat has given Jones the option of bringing in Slade, who arrived at the World Cup battling a knee injury that ruled him out of all four of England's warm-ups.\n\nHe came on as a late replacement in wins over Tonga and Argentina but has played only 40 minutes of international rugby since the Six Nations.\n\nFord, who has looked sharp in Japan, can consider himself unlucky to be left out but Jones will insist that as one of his \"finishers\" he will have a key role to play. The return of Mako Vunipola in the front row is also a big boost as the prop makes his first tournament start having played just a few minutes since suffering a hamstring injury in May.\n\nJonny May will win his 50th cap in the match and Jones said the World Cup had shown how hard the winger had worked on his game.\n\n\"He has come back from a significant knee injury to be close to the fastest winger, if not the fastest winger, in the world, and has the ability to score tries from any situation,\" he added. England have won their last six matches against Australia since losing to them in the pool stage of the 2015 World Cup, a defeat that knocked the hosts out. \"Once you get to the quarterfinals it\u2019s about having the right mindset,\" Jones said. \"We know how well we can play, it\u2019s about us playing to our strengths and trying to take away from what Australia want.\"\n\nThe winners will play New Zealand or Ireland in the semifinals.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "England coach Eddie Jones sprung a big surprise on Thursday by naming Owen Farrell to start at flyhalf in the World Cup quarterfinal against Australia, benching George Ford and bringing in Henry Slade to join Manu Tuilagi in midfield.
