Sign up here.\n\nMigrants held in detention centers owned by a private prison company in Louisiana say they\u2019re berated by guards, given moldy food, and placed in solitary confinement for protesting against the conditions they face.\n\nDespite years of documented and alleged abuse at its facilities, Ruston, Louisiana-based LaSalle Corrections has experienced a boom thanks to the Trump administration's immigration policies. Over the past year, the Department of Homeland Security has contracted eight new immigrant detention facilities in Louisiana, six of which are former prisons or jails owned and operated by LaSalle.\n\nEarlier this month, a migrant held at LaSalle\u2019s Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe died by suicide after being put in solitary confinement as punishment for participating in a hunger strike. Another migrant detained at the same facility, a Venezuelan asylum-seeker with diabetes and hypertension, has seen his health deteriorate because of the food served in the facility, his lawyer told VICE News.\n\n\u201cWe have requested, because of his medical condition, for him to be released on his own recognizance or through a bond,\u201d his lawyer, Nathalia Dickson, said. \u201cHe\u2019s been to the clinic they have in Richwood and has been going there to talk to the doctor. However, I see through his medical records that he\u2019s not being properly treated.\u201d\n\nRichwood isn\u2019t the only LaSalle-owned facility where detainees say they aren\u2019t treated well. Yuselys, a Cuban asylum-seeker whose partner is detained at LaSalle\u2019s Winn Correctional Center in Winnfield, Louisiana, said the people held there are in physical and psychological distress.\n\n\u201cAll of the people who are detained there are suffering,\u201d Yuselys, who asked to be identified only by her first name, told VICE News. \u201cThey\u2019re anxious, they\u2019re depressed, they lay in bed all day and don\u2019t want to get up for anything because of how depressed they are.\u201d\n\nYuselys said she often has to send money to her partner so he can buy food from the commissary, since the food in Winn\u2019s cafeteria is occasionally moldy. She said other detainees suffer from stomach aches because of the food. Now that winter is coming, she has to send him money for a jacket, too; she said the facility hasn\u2019t provided any.\n\nWinn, a former prison, started detaining migrants for ICE in May. The federal government pays the county $70 a day for each migrant detained in the facility, the Winnfield County sheriff told the Associated Press in October. That\u2019s more than twice what the state paid.\n\nFrom jails and prisons to immigrant detention\n\nFounded in 1997 by former nursing home owner Billy McConnell, LaSalle quickly became one of the biggest players in Louisiana\u2019s rapidly growing private prison industry. By 2012, one in seven prisoners in Louisiana were held in a LaSalle-owned facility, according to a report by the New Orleans Times-Picayune.\n\nIn 2017, when Richwood was still being used as a county jail, the families of two inmates filed wrongful death suits against LaSalle after one inmate stomped another to death before being killed by a guard. Both inmates\u2019 families said LaSalle\u2019s lack of adequate training for guards led to the deaths.\n\nEarlier this year, four former Richwood guards were found guilty of pepper spraying kneeling, handcuffed inmates at the facility \u2014 or of standing by while others did. Those guards no longer work at Richwood, which now holds civil immigrant detainees instead of people being held on criminal grounds.\n\nThough Richwood and the other LaSalle facilities are now used for civil detention, advocates say the culture of abuse and neglect hasn\u2019t changed.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at cases of medical neglect, they [private prison companies like LaSalle] have every incentive not to help people medically if it\u2019s going to cost them money,\u201d said Sofia Casini, the southern regional coordinator at the advocacy group Freedom for Immigrants. She helps organize visits to detention centers in Louisiana, including LaSalle\u2019s facilities.\n\nDetainees sit and wait for their turn at the medical clinic at the Winn Correctional Center in Winnfield, La., Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019.

After his death, Casini said, some migrants protested in the detention facility\u2019s yard and were beaten and handcuffed.\n\nICE officers were called in to the facility to break up the protest, according to Dickson, and one officer beat two of her other clients, both of whom are Cuban asylum-seekers. One received cuts under his eyes; her other client fractured his rib. An ICE spokesperson denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cFacility staff, with support from ICE personnel, talked with the detainees and defused the situation,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWhen a single detainee began to actively resist officers, he had to be placed in restraints. The facility returned to normal conditions.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, LaSalle spokesperson Scott Sutterfield told VICE News that the company is \u201cdeeply committed to delivering high-quality, culturally responsive services in safe and humane environments.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn general, LaSalle Corrections fully respects the rights of all people to voice their opinion without interference and we do not retaliate in any way against hunger strikers,\u201d Sutterfield said. \u201cAll allegations are taken very seriously and in addition to our facilities internal review process, the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General and ICE\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility investigate all allegations of abuse.\u201d\n\nThe seemingly indefinite nature of detention can also exacerbate the conditions in Richwood and other facilities, according to migrant\u2019s family members. But the decision to release migrants doesn\u2019t fall on the facilities, but on ICE.\n\n\u201cAll of the people who are detained there are suffering.\u201d\n\nMany asylum-seekers have been detained at facilities in Louisiana and across the Southeast for months. Even migrants who have passed their initial asylum interviews, known as \u201ccredible fear\u201d screenings, and proven they aren\u2019t a flight risk or a danger to the community have been denied parole, advocates say. ICE was detaining nearly 9,000 migrants who had passed these interviews in facilities across the country as of August.\n\nDenial of parole for asylum-seekers who have passed their initial screenings isn\u2019t new: Two 2016 reports by Human Rights First found instances of migrants being denied parole in facilities in Georgia and New Jersey. But it\u2019s become more prevalent under Trump. In 2017, Human Rights First found that parole approvals dropped sharply after the president issued an executive order requiring the Department of Homeland Security to detain immigrants for the entirety of their proceedings.\n\nParole denials have become particularly common in the five states covered by the New Orleans\u2019 ICE field which granted 75% of parole applications in 2016 compared to just 1.5% last year, according to a class-action lawsuit filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center in May.\n\nA federal judge temporarily blocked ICE from categorically denying asylum-seekers parole in September, but migrants\u2019 lawyers and relatives say they\u2019re still being denied release. An ICE spokesperson told VICE News that each parole decision \u201cis judged on its own merits with the totality of the situation being considered.\u201d\n\nYuselys, for example, said she hasn\u2019t seen her partner in nearly six months. They fled Cuba together, made the trek from southern Mexico to the U.S.-Mexico border, and asked for asylum at a port of entry in April. But since they aren\u2019t legally married, they were split up: She was sent to a women\u2019s detention center for two months, and he was shuffled from facility to facility before ending up at Winn in June.\n\nCover image: A detainee sits in a room to use a telephone inside the Winn Correctional Center in Winnfield, La., Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019.
