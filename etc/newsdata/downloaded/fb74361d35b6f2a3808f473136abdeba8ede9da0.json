Quarterback Matt Ryan felt the same way.\n\nThe Falcons need to fix their mistakes and quickly.\n\n\u201cThe penalties, turnovers, those kinds of things, we\u2019ve had too much of that in the first couple weeks of the season,\u201d said Ryan, the league\u2019s 2016 MVP. \u201cWe had too much of that today. Those are things we have to clean up to be a better football team.\u201d\n\nThe numbers - 16 penalties for 128 yards and minus-1 in the turnover battle - only told part of the story about the 27-24 loss at Indianapolis.\n\nAtlanta (1-2) finished one penalty short of matching the franchise\u2019s single-game record, set Nov. 5, 1978 at San Francisco and helped put them in a 17-point halftime deficit that they couldn\u2019t overcome.\n\nAnd yet the bigger concern may be this problem first surfaced during the preseason and shows no sign of abating.\n\nOnly eight teams started Week 3 with more penalties than the Falcons and Atlanta nearly doubled its previous total by committing more penalties in one game than 16 teams did in the first two weeks.\n\nSeven times, the Falcons extended Indy drives with penalties, including a defensive holding call against cornerback Damontae Kazee on third-and-10. Indy cashed in by scoring its final touchdown. And three times, Colts quarterback Jacoby Brissett drew the Falcons offside.\n\nNot enough?\n\nSafety Keanu Neal was called for unsportsmanlike conduct in the end zone on the same play he suffered an Achilles tendon injury. It cost the Falcons their final first-half timeout and gave Indy first-and-goal at the Falcons 4 after Neal was carted off the field.\n\nBrissett made the Falcons pay with a touchdown pass to T.Y. Hilton on the next play, giving the Colts a 20-3 lead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got work to do as we get ready because we\u2019ve got to get our road mentality right,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThis one stinks.\u201d\n\nOffensively, things didn\u2019t go much better.\n\nA holding call against left guard James Carpenter on Atlanta\u2019s first series knocked the Falcons out of field-goal range, and another scoring chance slipped away when Clayton Geathers picked off Ryan at the Colts 3-yard line in the first half. Ryan now has six interceptions in three games after throwing seven last year - something he promises to correct.\n\n\u201cWe had two good opportunities to come away with points and we didn\u2019t come away with points on either of those possessions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt turned out this was the kind of game where we needed those scores.\u201d\n\nRyan was only partly to blame, though. In addition to all the extra chances the Falcons\u2018 defense gave Indy, Atlanta struggled to get off the field.\n\nThe Falcons allowed scoring drives 93, 94 and 75 yards - the last coming after Ryan\u2019s second TD pass cut the deficit to 20-17. But when Colts receiver Zach Pascal ran free down the sideline for a 35-yard catch on third-and-1 with 9:24 left, Marlon Mack cashed in with a 4-yard run on the next play for a 27-17 lead.\n\nRyan answered again with a 10-yard TD pass to Julio Jones to make it 27-24 with 4:11 left.\n\nBut with a chance to get the ball back to Ryan for a shot at overtime or to play for the win, the defense again failed.\n\nAtlanta only forced one third down on the final possession and Brissett converted that by rolling out and finding an open Jack Doyle, who turned a short pass into an 11-yard gain. Indy kneeled down twice to seal it.\n\n\u201cI thought they did a good job controlling the ball early to create some first downs, but I think the fouls had something to do with that,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get that part under control for sure.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Quinn looked at the stat sheet and got right to the point Sunday.
