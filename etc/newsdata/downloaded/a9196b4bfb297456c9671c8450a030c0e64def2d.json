Christomy Christalin tweeted a photo of French Instagram model Rebecca Biangue, saying this is what he means when says he loves 'girls that don't wear makeup'\n\nSeriously? Critics took to the comment section to point out that she is wearing a full face of makeup while slamming him for being so clueless\n\n'Who's gonna tell him?' asked skincare expert Caroline Hirons.\n\n'I pray you\u2019re joking, she\u2019s wearing at least 15 products,' someone else wrote.\n\nAnother Twitter user was oozing with sarcasm when she commented: 'Wow she was born with eyeliner? Lucky!'\n\nPlenty of people chalked up of his apparent confusion to him being a man.\n\n'As long as you're not wearing red lipstick, men will think you've got no make up on,' one person wrote.\n\nStirring the pot: Christomy seemed to be enjoying the controversy, and in the comments, he called Rebecca a 'natural Queen'\n\nClarification: One Twitter stressed that Rebecca is a 'queen,' but she's not 'natural'\n\nTake that: Christomy couldn't resist clapping back at some of his critics who were lecturing him about makeup\n\nLaughing it off: He joked that he was going to 'become a makeup artist' after all the lessons he has been getting\n\nPerfect vision? One woman asked him what his prescription for glasses is, but he insisted he has 20/20 vision\n\nClarification; Another person tried to figure out if he was being serious by asking if he likes women that wear makeup, but he responded: 'That don't*'\n\n'When my makeup looks like this I've got foundation, concealer, bronzer, powder, eyebrow pomade, highlighter, eyeliner, mascara, lip liner, lipgloss, lipstick, eyelashes, and blush on,' someone else pointed out, adding: 'A lot of me wouldn't' know this though.'\n\nOne woman even went as far as sharing a chart showing 'what men think \"no makeup\" is' and 'what \"no makeup\" actually is.'\n\nChristomy seemed to be enjoying the controversy, and in the comments, he added: 'For whoever's asking this is the natural Queen @rebeccarihh.'\n\n'Queen? yes. Natural? nah,' someone clapped back.\n\nPeople were utterly confused as to whether or not he really thinks she isn't wearing any makeup in the glamorous photo.\n\nOne person tried to figure it by asking, 'So you like women that wear makeup?' but he responded: 'That don't*.'\n\n'A lot of y'all sound like y'all know a lot about makeup but why y'all s**t be looking so bad then? Explain that,' he hit back in another tweet.\n\n'Lol I'm bout to become a make up artist after all these free lessons. Thank you,' he added.\n\nThose who weren't outraged insisted that he was just trolling people with his post, and while Christomy didn't confirm their theory, he did retweet a lot of their comments.\n\n'This was clearly a joke meant to satirize how oblivious most men are when it comes to makeup, but I understand that being Mad On The Internet is more fun for a lot of people,' one person wrote.\n\nDifferent take: Those who weren't outraged insisted he was just trolling people with his post\n\nStart of it all: Ironically, when Rebecca originally posted the photo, commenters begged her for a makeup tutorial\n\nNot-so natural: Rebecca even went as far as telling one fan all of the products she used to create her natural-looking lip color\n\n'So.....this joke just went over EVERYONE's head, or?' another asked.\n\n'Y'all know damn well he's trolling,' someone else insisted. 'You twitter hooligans p**s me off.'\n\nWhether or not Christomy is actually this clueless when it comes to makeup remains unclear, but his tweet has already inspired a few memes.\n\nOne person shared his tweet but replaced Rebecca's photo with a picture of Joaquin Phoenix wearing clown makeup while dressed as the Joker.\n\nAnother did the same thing with a GIF of a woman applying clown makeup to her face.\n\nIronically, when Rebecca originally posted the photo, commenters begged her for a makeup tutorial. She even went as far as telling one fan all of the products she used to create her natural-looking lip color.\n\n'A brown pencil + Dose of colors ref one and only + the mac lipglass [sic],' she wrote.", "description": "Christomy Christalin, who is known as 'mrchris95' online, took to Twitter last week to post a photo of French Instagram model Rebecca Biangue wearing a full face of makeup.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/22/20302530-0-image-a-3_1572302756631.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
