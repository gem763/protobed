EP Today's office address, at 37 Square de Meeus, is the same as that of the Srivastava Group, a New Delhi-based company which lists the New Delhi Times as one of its assets (but not EP Today).\n\nThere was no reply to requests for comment from Srivastava.\n\nMuch of EP Today's content \u2014 which is also drawn from the U.S.-funded Voice of America outlet \u2014 is linked to Indian interests and is critical of Pakistan, DisinfoLab's research showed.\n\nOn August 27, for example, EP Today published an article criticizing Donald Trump's offer to mediate between India and Pakistan, while op-eds have criticized Pakistan's foreign policy goals as \"jihad\" and called for the secession of the restive Pakistani region of Balochistan.\n\nDisinfoLab's investigation \"reveals just how complicated this field of research [disinformation] is; it shows how attribution is always difficult, and how caution should be taken when reporting on disinformation investigations,\u201d Gary Machado, managing director at EU DisinfoLab, told POLITICO.\n\nPakistani suspicions\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, the EP Today site was still operating.\n\nIts Facebook page, which had been liked by 145,000 people, was taken down on Tuesday following inquiries, including by POLITICO. A Twitter account associated with the group has been permanently suspended.\n\n\u201cWe don't comment on individual accounts for security and privacy reasons. Impersonating another user, brand or organization in a confusing or deceptive way is a violation of the Twitter Rules,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson said. Under Twitter\u2019s impersonation policy, \u201caccounts that pose as another person, brand, or organization in a confusing or deceptive manner\u201d can be deleted.\n\nAttempts to reach a phone number listed for EP Today went directly to voicemail. Neither EP Today nor the Srivastava Group are listed on the intercom at 37 Square du Meeus.\n\nPakistani officials had long shared their misgivings about the website, given the volume of stories the website put out that criticized the country.\n\nAt a plenary event on September 18 meant to discuss the crisis in Kashmir, where many MEPs piled on India for its curfew and information blackout, EP Today published two separate articles based on comments made by two MEPs \u2014 Ryszard Czarnecki and Fulvio Martusciello \u2014 both of which criticized Pakistan. No story on critical comments made towards India was published.", "description": "Site targeting MEPs pushes pro-Indian policy positions and recycles content from RT, research shows.", "authors": ["Laura Kayali", "Saim Saeed", "Nicholas Vinocur", "Mark Scott", "Laurens Cerulus", "Madalina Ciulin"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-986887924-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
