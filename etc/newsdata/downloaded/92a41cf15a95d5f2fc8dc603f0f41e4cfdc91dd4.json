Its soul", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said the league wasn't apologizing for Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's since-deleted tweet showing support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. (Oct. 8) AP, AP\n\nIt was a short tweet. Only seven words. But it ripped the fa\u00e7ade off of two giant forces, the Chinese government and the National Basketball Association, and exposed their hypocrisies in a sobering light. If you\u2019ve ever doubted the power of free speech, and the perils of silence, you need only to have watched the events of last week.\n\n\u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d Those were the seven words, tweeted out by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, a man who, when it comes to famous names in the NBA, is on the same level as the team trainer. He\u2019s not a player. He\u2019s not recognizable. He deleted the tweet shortly after he posted it.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop China, the most populous nation on the planet, from going berserk. The government-owned TV network canceled televising the NBA exhibition games being played there. The internet streaming was canceled as well. The Chinese Basketball Association suspended all association with the Houston Rockets. And China\u2019s consul general in Houston demanded the team \u201cimmediately correct the mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhen the NBA made a statement explaining Morey\u2019s First Amendment rights, the CCTV network quickly countered that \"any remarks that challenge (China\u2019s) national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nShortly after that, all 11 of the NBA\u2019s official partners in China \u2014 from a travel company to a fast food chain \u2014 suspended their ties with the league.\n\nAll this for a tweet that the Chinese people couldn\u2019t even see \u2014 because Twitter is banned in China.\n\nNets' Theo Pinson, left, drives against Lakers' Danny Green during a preseason game at the Mercedes Benz Arena in Shanghai, China, Thursday. (Photo: AP)\n\nStill, as awful as that is, it almost pales in comparison to how the NBA reacted.\n\nChina, we expect to ignore civil rights.\n\nThe NBA should be better.\n\nMoney talks\n\nInstead, our basketball league made one misstep after another, showing how slippery the floor gets when you\u2019ve papered it with money.\n\nFirst, they trotted out Houston's James Harden, the NBA superstar, to try and appease things. He began, \u201cWe apologize, uh, you know. We love China. We love playing here.\u201d\n\nWay to stick up for your general manager, James.\n\nThe league itself put out a statement: \u201cWe recognize that the views expressed by \u2026Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d\n\nWay to stick up for freedom of speech, NBA.\n\nIt fell to the league's commissioner, Adam Silver, who has been outspoken on his players\u2019 rights to protest American policies, to try and clean up the mess. He eventually defended Morey\u2019s freedom of expression. But then his league canceled all media opportunities for the NBA players in China, effectively shutting down that very same freedom. This was after a CNN reporter dared to ask Harden a question about the issue, only to be told by a team official, \u201cWe\u2019re only taking basketball questions.\u201d\n\nThe reporter surrendered the microphone.\n\nHarden sat mute.\n\nNow, if all of this seems like something out of 1950s Russia, that\u2019s because China, in 2019, still behaves in the same authoritarian manner, denying access to world communication, destroying those who would speak out against its government.\n\nWhich begs the question: Why the heck is the NBA so involved with China in the first place?\n\nThe answer is obvious.\n\nBillions.\n\nBlinded by billions\n\nBillions of dollars, and 1.4 billion people. It is a marketplace that has made many an American CEO dizzy with greed, seeing all those potential customers just waiting to be served. The NBA is no different than other U.S. businesses that have raced in to capitalize on the Chinese marketplace. Never mind that China\u2019s government is so antithetical to American ideas, it ought to give them pause. Forget it. There\u2019s so much money to be made! They\u2019re like drillers in a massive oil field, giddy in their digging.\n\nBut as we saw last week, there\u2019s more than dollars at the bottom of those holes. There\u2019s principle. Let\u2019s remember what this NBA incident is all about. Morey\u2019s tweet wasn\u2019t some radical far-left or far-right statement. He mentioned \u201cfreedom\u201d \u2014 the defining word for America \u2014 and Hong Kong, which has been under the heel of China, the Brits, then China again, and is now fighting a law that would have \u201cdissidents\u201d (meaning those who don\u2019t agree with China\u2019s iron-first government) extradited from Hong Kong to face justice in mainland China.\n\nHow would you feel if you were plucked from your supposedly independent government to face punishment someplace else?\n\nMorey was not only correct in his ideals, he was correct in his practice. One person. One voice. Making a statement. It was a tweet. He didn\u2019t blow anything up. Yet it somehow required a week's worth of couched apologies and the mooting of American voices.\n\nThis further illustrates the complicated web the NBA has crawled into with its insatiable desire to be \"global.\" China now makes up 10% of the NBA\u2019s annual revenue. It\u2019s only growing. Shoe companies like Nike and Adidas are seeing massive growth in China, much bigger than they see here in America.\n\nWhich begs another question:\n\nWhat will LeBron James have to say about this?\n\nA King's ransom\n\nJames is arguably Nike\u2019s biggest star. He has been outspoken in supporting athletes kneeling during the national anthem, which he defends as free speech, outspoken on American police abusing power, outspoken on minorities being marginalized by government forces.\n\nWell? How does all that not apply to those protesting in Hong Kong? You can flip to any number of videos right now and see them beaten, hosed, tear-gassed.\n\nAnd you can bet if a Chinese athlete at a major national event got down on his knees during China\u2019s national anthem, he'd be facing a whole lot more than booing.\n\nSo will James speak out when he and his L.A. Lakers teammates return from China and those now controversial exhibition games? Or will he sit mute like Harden did, like others in the NBA are doing, because they\u2019re all afraid of disrupting the giant money cart that China represents?\n\nWould James and fellow Nike endorsers have the guts to make even the simple statement that Morey did \u2014 knowing how much money Nike makes in China? If not, why should anyone listen when they selectively choose to decry something else?\n\nYou stand for something or you fall for anything. Right now, the NBA, which has been so proud of standing for democratic principles, is having its spine tested by a marriage it couldn\u2019t help itself from rushing into, because the bride was just so rich. China continues to seduce American businesses. But we\u2019re starting to see the real price of all those billions.\n\nContact Mitch Albom: malbom@freepress.com.
