Forkner said the new automated flight system, called MCAS, was \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201crunning rampant\u201d while he tested it in a flight simulator.\n\nThe exchange occurred as Boeing BA, -6.79% was trying to convince the Federal Aviation Administration the system was safe.\n\nThe FAA\u2019s administrator on Friday demanded an explanation from Boeing, including why the company delayed telling the agency about the messages for several months.\n\nBoeing said Sunday it\u2019s continuing to investigate the circumstances of the exchange but that the simulator software described by Forkner in 2016 was still in testing and had not been finalized. The company said it had briefed both the FAA and international regulators \u201con multiple occasions\u201d about the final configuration of the flight system.\n\nCongress is ramping up its scrutiny of Boeing as its CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, is scheduled to testify to the House\u2019s transportation committee on Oct. 30.\n\nAlong with the newly revealed internal messages, Muilenburg could be grilled about the results of a 2016 employee survey obtained by the House committee and reviewed by The Associated Press which shows 39% of responding employees said they felt \u201cpotential undue pressure\u201d on the job.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Sunday was first to report about the survey, which also shows 29% were concerned about consequences if they reported the undue pressure.", "description": "Boeing says it regrets concerns raised about internal communications it recently handed over to Congress and federal regulators that are investigating two...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT644_Boeing_ZG_20191018170156.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
