REUTERS/Beawiharta\n\nThe draft conclusions, expected to be the first formal government finding of flaws in the design and U.S. regulatory approval, also identify a string of pilot errors and maintenance mistakes as causal factors of the Lion Air crash, the WSJ here said.\n\nThe plane has been grounded since March in the aftermath of two fatal crashes in five months.\n\nA Boeing spokesman did not comment on the newspaper report but said the plane maker continued to offer support to the investigating authorities as they complete their report.\n\nReuters could not immediately contact the Indonesian investigators to seek comment.\n\nU.S. air crash investigators are readying to announce a handful of separate safety recommendations, from bolstering pilots\u2019 manual flying skills to boosting Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) vetting of new aircraft designs, the paper added.\n\nAround month-end, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is expected to call for improvements to cockpit training and crew decision making and focus on potential changes to certification of new airliners, WSJ said.\n\nThe NTSB declined to comment on the WSJ report but said it planned to release recommendations on the FAA\u2019s certification program sometime in September.\n\nThe FAA welcomed the scrutiny from safety experts and looked forward to their findings, it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work with other international aviation safety regulators and will carefully consider all recommendations,\u201d it added. \u201cThe FAA will incorporate any changes that would improve our certification activities.\u201d", "description": "Indonesian investigators have found that design and oversight lapses played a key role in the October crash of Boeing Co's 737 MAX jet that killed all 189 aboard, the Wall Street Journal said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432762429&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0VO", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
