(AP) - Whether a close game or a blowout, Wake Forest always seemed to find a way lately to lose to Florida State.\n\nThis time, the Atlantic Coast Conference\u2019s highest-scoring offense found a way to beat the Seminoles - by kicking a bunch of field goals.\n\nNick Sciba kicked a 25-yard field goal - his school-record-tying fifth of the game - with 4:18 remaining, and Wake Forest beat Florida State 22-20 on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cIt stinks that our offense wasn\u2019t able to get in the end zone, but I\u2019m glad that I was able to do my part and do my job in order to help us get a great team win, which I think was a big, pivotal win for us,\u201d Sciba said.\n\nCade Carney had a 3-yard touchdown run on the second play of the fourth quarter, Sam Hartman was 21 of 38 for 308 yards in his first start of the season and Sage Surratt had seven catches for 170 yards - his fourth game of the season with at least 150.\n\nThe Demon Deacons (6-1, 2-1), who average an ACC-best 39.7 points and 540.5 total yards, were held to a season-low point total. Yet they won a game with three lead changes in the fourth, snapped a seven-game losing streak in the series and bounced back from their record-setting 62-59 loss to Louisville.\n\nWake Forest lost its previous two home games against Florida State by a combined 15 points, and lost by 21 in Tallahassee last year. This was just its second victory over the Seminoles since 2008 and first since 2011.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some good wins here over the last 3-4 years, but I thought that was as gritty of a win as we\u2019ve had,\u201d coach Dave Clawson said. \u201cJust kind of refusing to give up and finding a way.\u201d\n\nJames Blackman put the Seminoles (3-4, 2-3) up 20-19 with his 36-yard touchdown pass to Tamorrion Terry with 11:22 to play.\n\nFlorida State had the ball twice after Sciba\u2019s final field goal. Ricky Aguayo was wide left on a 50-yard field goal into the wind with 2:13 remaining. After the Seminoles forced a stop and got the ball back with 35 seconds left, Blackman fumbled the final two snaps. He recovered them both, but the last one ended the game.\n\nFlorida State has lost two straight Atlantic Division games after winning three in a row.\n\n\u201cThat one hurt,\u201d coach Willie Taggart said. \u201cBig-time.\u201d\n\nCam Akers rushed for 157 yards behind a beaten-up offensive line and scored two touchdowns, rushing 2 yards for a score before taking a slick crossing pass from Blackman 19 yards for another TD for the Seminoles.\n\nBlackman finished 27 of 43 for 280 yards with the two scores for Florida State after Taggart played it coy by declining to say whether Blackman or Alex Hornibrook would start against the Demon Deacons.\n\nThe second half was played in a persistent shower with Tropical Storm Nestor churning its way across central North Carolina.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nFlorida State: The Seminoles sure didn\u2019t look like they have the second-worst total defense in the ACC, allowing 464.5 yards per game. They bowed up and held the Demon Deacons out of the end zone on 13 of their 14 possessions, holding them to field goals five times inside the 10. But the offense turned it over twice and just couldn\u2019t put one more score on the board when it needed one.\n\n\u201cWe say this every week but it\u2019s true - can\u2019t turn the football over,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take care of the football. We didn\u2019t do a real good job of that, and we turned it over in critical situations.\u201d\n\nWake Forest: Turns out the Demon Deacons could beat Florida State with a bunch of 3s and only one touchdown. A week after putting up 59 points in a losing effort against Louisville, the Demon Deacons struggled to score touchdowns in the red zone, settling for those five Sciba field goals in addition to the Carney touchdown. Their last three games have been decided by a combined eight points - but this one could have been a lot more lopsided.\n\nROSTER SHUFFLE\n\nTaggart had to repeatedly reshuffle his lineup on both sides of the ball due to injuries and a targeting flag on his top tackler. The Seminoles lost safety Hamsah Nasirildeen to a targeting flag on their first defensive series. And among the handful of Florida State players who went down with injuries of varying severity were starting center Baveon Johnson, left guard Brady Scott and receiver Ontaria Wilson.\n\nSAM\u2018S START\n\nHartman started the first nine games as a freshman in 2018 before suffering a season-ending leg injury. Jamie Newman took over and did nothing to relinquish the job, leading the Demon Deacons to a 4-1 finish last season and rolling up an ACC-best average of 341.2 total yards through six games before injuring his left shoulder in the second half against Louisville. He watched from the sideline in sweats.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\u201cInstead of reading about how we can\u2019t beat Florida State, now you guys can write again how we don\u2019t win after a bye week.\u201d - Clawson, whose teams in six seasons at Wake Forest have never won its first game after a week off.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlorida State: Plays host to Syracuse on Saturday.\n\nWake Forest: Plays host to North Carolina State on Nov. 2.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Whether a close game or a blowout, Wake Forest always seemed to find a way lately to lose to Florida State.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joedy Mccreary"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/florida_state_wake_forest_football_88221_c0-171-4108-2567_s1200x700.jpg?175912504dcf56ae9b931aee53cf496cb7b6b67f", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
