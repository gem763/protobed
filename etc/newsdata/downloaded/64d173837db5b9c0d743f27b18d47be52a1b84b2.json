Federer is 26-0 on that surface against the players left on his half of the bracket. The next step for the five-time champion at Flushing Meadows is a quarterfinal against unseeded Grigor Dimitrov. The other men\u2019s quarterfinal on Day 9 of the Grand Slam tournament is No. 5 Daniil Medvedev against No. 23 Stan Wawrinka, who advanced when defending champion and No. 1 seed Djokovic retired from their fourth-round match because of a painful left shoulder. Federer is 6-0 against Dimitrov on hard courts and, should he move on, would bring unbeaten records on the surface into a semifinal against either Wawrinka (17-0) or Medvedev (3-0). The 38-year-old Federer is trying to become the oldest Grand Slam semifinalist since Jimmy Connors was 39 during his 1991 run at the U.S. Open; No. 78 Dimitrov is trying to become the lowest-ranked semifinalist in New York since Connors was No. 174 that year. Wawrinka, who won the 2016 U.S. Open, faces maybe the most in-form player on tour at the moment in Medvedev, who leads the ATP with 48 wins and is 9-0 in quarterfinals this year. Serena Williams tries to get back to the semifinals when she plays first-time quarterfinalist Wang Qiang, while No. 5 Elina Svitolina meets No. 16 Johanna Konta.\n\nTUESDAY\u2019S FORECAST\n\nSunny. High of 81 degrees (27 C).\n\nMONDAY\u2019S WEATHER\n\nShowers. High of 75 degrees (24 C).\n\nMONDAY\u2019S KEY RESULTS\n\nMen\u2019s fourth round: No. 20 Diego Schwartzman beat No. 6 Alexander Zverev 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-3; No. 24 Matteo Berrettini beat Andrey Rublev 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (6).\n\nWomen\u2019s fourth round: No. 13 Belinda Bencic beat No. 1 Naomi Osaka 7-5, 6-4; No. 23 Donna Vekic beat No. 26 Julia Goerges 6-7 (5), 7-5, 6-3; No. 25 Elise Mertens beat Kristie Ahn 6-1, 6-1.\n\nSTAT OF THE DAY\n\n42 - Years since the last time a man from Italy reached the quarterfinals at the U.S. Open; Matteo Berrettini is the first to do so since Corrado Barazzutti in 1977.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n\u201cI honestly didn\u2019t move well today.
