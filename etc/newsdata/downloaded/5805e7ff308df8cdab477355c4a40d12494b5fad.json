If you love marl grey and super soft jersey, these are absolutely you. They\u2019re roomy and super cosy and are absolutely ok to be wearing around the house on weekends (and boyond to be honest). We guarantee you won\u2019t take to take them off. They do come up large, so definitely size down.\n\nBuy now\n\nNightire bamboo wild Christmas long pyjama set: \u00a358, Nightire\n\nNow this is Christmas themed, but 2019 Christmas, so see ya all things red and hello cacti and llamas. These dreamy yellow jammies are far more festive than you first think, with cute llammas in festive hats and cacti wrapped in twinkly lights. Made from bamboo, they\u2019re sustainable and incredibly silky that you\u2019ll want to wear these beyond the festive period \u2013 luckily there\u2019s also non Christmas themed prints if you want another, which we also love for the summer.\n\nBuy now\n\nEberjey gisele sporty stretch-jersey pyjama set: \u00a3140, Selfridges\n\nThis brand started in 1996 designer underwear for \u201claterally challenged flat bottomed women\u201d, which one of the owners wanted to create to suit herself. It\u2019s since grown and offers loungewear and pjs, too. We love this contemporary and rather sporty set with its side stripe, cuffed ankles and rugby-style top. It\u2019s casual but chic loungewear. Made with cosy jersey it\u2019s a loose fit, but not boyfriend style. We especially like the curved hem of the top that covers the bum too. We\u2019re not surprised this set is the brand\u2019s most popular design, but if you\u2019d rather something less athletic looking, we also love the oh-so sophisticated wrap top Nightcap stretch-modal set.\n\nBuy now\n\nTopshop forest green satin short pyjama set: \u00a330, Topshop\n\nFor some of the warm blooded among us, long pjs are just too hot even in winter, so they\u2019ll always need to stick to a short set. But when they come in this gorgeous forest green colour and a satin material, it\u2019s hard not to look Christmassy. These are chic, with contrasting silvery piping round the collar, cuffs and bottom of shorts and buttons. We think they will look even look great for breakfast on Christmas morning. Also available in mustard with mid-length sleeves.\n\nBuy now\n\nCath Kidston Christmas village pyjama set: \u00a355, Cath Kidston\n\nIf this set doesn\u2019t scream Christmas ski holiday attire, we don\u2019t know what will. This cosy brushed cotton pair were made for wintery holidays and we love the cute print that\u2019s nothing less than we\u2019d expect from the kitsch queen herself, including the sausage dogs running about in the snow. As these are brushed cotton, they\u2019re fairly thick and are best saved for those really chilly nights \u2013 and work equally as well for lounging too.\n\nBuy now\n\nDesmond & Dempsey Milou long set: \u00a3150, Desmond & Dempsey\n\nAnother cult fave sleepwear brand of ours is Desmond & Dempsey, whose designs are inspired by lazy Sundays and boyfriend fit pjs. These are made with 100 per cent cotton and are some of the softest we tested. The fit is more tailored than some of the brand\u2019s other designs, but they\u2019re long in the arm and leg and super comfy. Inspired by a cafe in Mexico City, Cafe Milou, the print is painted in watercolour and uses some of the city\u2019s pink cabs and blue horses. You can have then monogrammed for \u00a323.\n\nBuy now\n\nCyberjammies Belle brushed long sleeve check pyjama set: \u00a348, Cyberjamies\n\nBrushed cotton is the ultimate winter material for pjs in our eyes and classic red tartan is a real go-to festive look for us, too \u2013 even if you\u2019re not Scottish. This set from Cyberjammies have pockets and a drawstring elasticated waist for a comfy fit. If you love the print, but fancy another style, you can buy separates and mix and match, or got for a nightshirt. There\u2019s also matching dressing gown and eye mask. If you\u2019ve got kids, you can even go matching with a set in the brand\u2019s Minijammies range.\n\nBuy now\n\nHonna red stripe pyjama set: \u00a395, Trouva\n\nThis 100 per cent cotton set looks like a deliciously sweet candy cane and we think the design is the perfect subtle Christmas look for those who prefer to be more understated. Designed by founder, Barbara McMillan, who spent 10 years working as a stylist, she created the kind of classic, but luxury pjs she wanted. We like the fairly boxy fit of the top, with wide sleeves and the straight bottoms are a very good length too, even for our tall tester. Available in seven striped colours and two white sets with navy or red piping.\n\nBuy now\n\nYolke prowling leopard cotton pyjama set: \u00a3145, Yolke\n\nLaunched in 2013, this London brand founded by friends Ella Ringner and Anna Williamson first began using just silk, but has since branched out to cotton (like this set) and linen too. Known for its bold prints and matching mini me versions, Yolke also has a range of pj-inspired daywear too, using the same luxue prints and materials like the luxurious silk leopard print wrap dress. We love the print of these 100 per cent cotton pjs, which have side pockets, drawstring bottoms and a relaxed fit.\n\nBuy now\n\nNext navy stripe pocket cotton pyjamas: \u00a315, Next\n\nA blue and grey stripe is a match made in heaven when it comes to loungewear for us, and this cotton set hits that relaxed Sunday feel on the head. Complete with its own Calvin Klein boxer short inspired white and black branded waistband on the leggings, these are comfy, soft and very affordable. They\u2019re also a good option for people who don\u2019t like buttons and tie waists.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Women\u2019s winter pyjamas\n\nWe think it\u2019s very hard to beat The White Company's classic jersey pyjama set, for comfort, super soft material \u2013 we absolutely struggle to take them off. If you\u2019re after a different style, we think Eberjey\u2019s gisele sporty stretch-jersey pyjama set is fun, but for something to wear on Christmas day and is more affordable, we love Topshop\u2019s forest green satin set.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
