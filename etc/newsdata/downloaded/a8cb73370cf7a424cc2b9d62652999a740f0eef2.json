Briscoe Cain on Saturday bragged that his controversial gun tweet that many deemed as a threat against Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke had actually helped boost his popularity among voters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret it. I just checked Twitter again, and I still can\u2019t use it,\u201d Mr. Cain, a Republican, said at The Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, The Texas Tribune reported.\n\n\u201cIt was good for both of us,\u201d he said. \u201cI trended [on Twitter]. I increased my name ID. It is what I believe. I don\u2019t regret it at all.\u201d\n\nMr. Cain was suspended from Twitter earlier this month for his response to Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s controversial call during the last primary debate to confiscate law-abiding Americans\u2019 military-style rifles.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke declared.\n\n\u201cMy AR is ready for you,\u201d Mr. Cain tweeted.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke later said he considered Mr. Cain\u2019s tweet to be a death threat and alerted the FBI. He used the incident to fundraise for Mr. Cain\u2019s challenger, Josh Markle, The Tribune reported.\n\nMr. Cain has denied his tweet was a threat, telling Fox News earlier this month that Mr. O\u2019Rourke was the one making threats that he\u2019s going to confiscate people\u2019s property.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s threatened to trespass on my property and the property of others or to kick down our door and take from us,\u201d the Republican said.\n\n\u201cWhat I wrote really is just another way of saying \u2018Come and take it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cain added, a reference to a popular rally cry in the Texas Revolution.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
