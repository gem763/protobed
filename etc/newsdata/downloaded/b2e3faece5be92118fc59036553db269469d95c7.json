General Assembly last week, calling out China for forced internment of more than 1 million Uighurs in \u201ctraining camps\u201d to be \u201cre-educated\u201d and \u201csaved\u201d from their culture, language and faith.\n\nAccording to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, China is the perpetrator of \u201cthe worst human rights crises of our time.\u201d China denies this, touting itself a defender of human rights by providing \u201cdevelopment, health, nutrition, and housing\u201d \u2014 its own \u201capproach\u201d to human rights that has nothing to do with individual freedoms.\n\nChina\u2019s approach is not surprising given that international human rights advocacy is so \u201cwatered down\u201d by political agenda that it\u2019s hard to tell the difference between protecting God-given natural rights and government entitlements.\n\nTo help rectify this, Mr. Pompeo recently announced the U.S. Commission on Unalienable Rights to ground U.S. foreign policy on human rights in America\u2019s founding principles of individual dignity and freedom. The Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, as well as the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), are guides for the commission.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence states that unalienable rights are based in God-given natural law and include \u201cLife, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d These rights, like freedom of conscience and belief, are \u201cnatural\u201d because they\u2019re inherent to all human beings and are to be protected by government, not given by government, as demonstrated in the U.S. Bill of Rights.\n\nNatural rights should not be confused with government-given entitlements created for certain interest groups, as a need arises or as societies change. Sometimes it is hard to discern the difference, and this is what the U.S. commission will address.\n\nSadly, as in the case of China, confusion about fundamental rights offers cover to authoritarian and totalitarian governments that provide benefits to citizens as a demonstration of \u201chuman rights,\u201d all the while censoring the press, oppressing religious freedom or imprisoning political dissidents. As the Declaration of Independence states, the purpose of government is to secure unalienable rights and any government that does not is illegitimate.\n\nA watered-down human rights narrative takes focus off of the real victims of abuse \u2014 like a Sudanese woman imprisoned for her Christian faith, men in Syria and Iraq being thrown off buildings, and more than 1 million imprisoned Uighurs.\n\nIn today\u2019s hyper-sensitive climate of rights-based advocacy, so many now advocate in the name of \u201chuman rights\u201d that economic and social goals are often confused with fundamental or unalienable rights, leading to less individual freedom, not more.\n\nExamples of this activism includes the \u201crights\u201d to free university education, Internet access, compete on women\u2019s sports teams, legalized abortion and even the right not to be offended. We all have differing opinions about these, but that\u2019s the point. By primarily protecting our \u201cnatural\u201d human rights, we also protect the freedom to pursue differing political goals and ideological preferences.\n\nSome left-leaning senators have stated concern that the U.S. commission will not protect \u201cinternationally recognized definitions of human rights, particularly \u2026 reproductive rights and the rights of \u2026 LGBT persons.\u201d This demonstrates not only a misunderstanding of \u201cinternationally recognized definitions of human rights\u201d (i.e. there is no international right to abortion, and furthermore the majority of countries in the world oppose it), but again the need to \u201crefocus\u201d on what human rights really are.\n\nFor example, women and the LGBT community are covered by the same fundamental human rights of all people. That\u2019s the great thing about universal human rights \u2014 they\u2019re not just for identity groups \u2014 they\u2019re for everybody because all have inherent dignity and the right to individual freedoms.\n\nThe very fact that some cry that the commission will hurt these groups demonstrates its necessity: People confuse the promotion of a sexual-rights-identity-group agenda with fundamental human rights. The United States will continue to stand against the oppression and abuse of all people, and for this reason, everyone \u2014 including the most prominent women\u2019s rights and LGBT organizations \u2014 should get squarely behind this commission.\n\nMr. Pompeo and his staff are to be commended for their \u201cfresh thinking\u201d approach to U.S. foreign policy. A letter, signed by 46 of the most influential human rights, women\u2019s and religious freedom leaders and organizations, applauds Mr. Pompeo for establishing the commission.\n\nOne word of caution for the commission \u2014 the UDHR, though a historically important document which elevated the protection of individual freedoms, was one of the first examples of conflating fundamental human rights with social and economic goals, and this should be kept in mind.\n\nIn the end, the U.S. Commission on Unalienable Rights will do more than help rectify human rights abuses. It will uncover the agenda of some countries that hide behind economic and social achievements as a sign of protecting human rights.\n\nMoreover, it will ultimately reassert the right kind of American leadership in the international liberal order. This leadership is based, as it should be, in America\u2019s founding principles of God-given life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness \u2014 the principles which led to what the world calls \u201cAmerican exceptionalism.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Shea Garrison is vice president of international affairs for Concerned Women for America and a policy fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Schar School of Policy and Government.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
