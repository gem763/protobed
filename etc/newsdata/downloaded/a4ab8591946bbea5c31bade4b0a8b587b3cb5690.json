Often the second level of authentication is a code that is sent to your phone. It\u2019s a quick and easy way to help protect your banking information from being hacked.\n\nBut even authentication codes sent via text message aren\u2019t entirely secure, as hackers can gain control of your phone through a so-called SIM swap\u2014in which they convince your wireless carrier to transfer your phone number to a new SIM card\u2014meaning they\u2019ll receive the codes and can use them to access your account if they\u2019ve also managed to steal your password, says Arvind Narayanan, an associate professor of computer science at Princeton University whose research focuses on information privacy and security.\n\n\u201cInstead,\u201d Dr. Narayanan says, \u201cusing an authenticator app is a more secure second factor.\u201d These apps generate a code, which changes regularly, that can be used to unlock your accounts. Since the codes only appear on your device, they can\u2019t be stolen in a SIM swap.\n\nApply software updates promptly\n\nIt might seem onerous, but it\u2019s a good idea to update your phone, as well as any banking apps you might use, so you aren\u2019t leaving yourself vulnerable to malware that could steal your information. It often isn\u2019t clear what exactly you are protecting yourself against when you update your software, says Will LaSala, director of security solutions at OneSpan , a cybersecurity company. But that\u2019s because the software providers don\u2019t want to reveal the software\u2019s vulnerabilities, he says. So, you should make all updates as they become available, even if you aren\u2019t sure why they\u2019re needed.\n\nCheck your app\u2019s permissions\n\nPhoto: Greg Mably\n\nWhen you install a new app, it\u2019s tempting to allow it to access whatever it asks permission for, just so you don\u2019t have to think about it. But you should be wary of doing that, particularly for banking apps, as hackers can exploit those permissions to gain access to your personal information.\n\nOnly install apps from official channels\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t download banking apps\u2014or any apps, for that matter\u2014if you come across them in a third-party app store, where bogus versions of official apps are \u201crampant,\u201d says Michael Covington, vice president of product strategy at Wandera, which develops mobile security solutions. Mr. Covington adds that you should be careful not to be fooled into installing any extras, such as developer certificates or profiles, which could allow developers to inspect your internet traffic or install other apps on your device.\n\nBanking App Acceptance Top Reasons for Not Mobile Banking, by Generation How They Are Used Consumers who use mobile-banking apps like them for different things, with some performing only a couple of tasks.

Doing so typically will let you see the last several logins to your account, so you can see if there has been any unauthorized activity. Also, he says, \u201cmany banks are now identifying known attacks against mobile users in the fraud section of their web portals,\u201d information that you can use to remain vigilant against the latest methods being used by hackers.\n\nDon\u2019t use public wireless networks\n\nTry to avoid logging in to any banking apps over public Wi-Fi, where hackers can easily dangle rogue wireless networks that can gain access to your traffic. It\u2019s always a safer choice to use your device\u2019s cellular data, says Brian Reed, chief marketing officer at NowSecure, a mobile-app security company, as it is \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d to steal data over a cellular connection.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What would you like to see from your wireless banking experience? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cWhen in doubt, stay connected to the cell tower,\u201d he says. If you choose to use a mobile hotspot instead, he adds, use a VPN, or virtual private network, so you can encrypt your traffic.\n\nSee that your financial apps adhere to regulatory standards\n\nBe careful which apps you use to keep track of your finances, says Mr. Reed. While there are a number of apps aside from your main banking app that can help manage your expenses and keep an eye on your personal finances, they may not have the same reporting requirements that commercial banks do. So you should only go with credible companies\u2014and take the same security measures that you would with your main banking app.\n\nThe same goes for mobile payment apps, he says. Venmo, for instance, is federally regulated, as it says on its website. In general, Mr. Reed says, you should look to popular, well-known brands, and apps with four- and five-star reviews that also have thousands of reviewers. If you see an app with only a few dozen reviews that does the same thing as an app with, say, 100,000 reviews, opt for the app with more reviews, he says.\n\nUse a password manager\n\nPhoto: Greg Mably\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to use a different password for every website you patronize. If you aren\u2019t willing to do that, you should at least use a long, complex password for your banking app that is different from every other password you have. This will help ensure that if your other passwords are compromised, hackers won\u2019t be able to use them to access your account. To keep track of everything, you would do well to use a password manager, says Jeremy Gillula, tech projects editor at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for digital privacy.\n\nSuch managers store your passwords directly on your device or in encrypted form in the cloud, making them difficult to hack. If you want to take your digital security one step further, Mr. Gillula says, you can use the password manager to make up random password-recovery questions\u2014which you can also write out on a piece of paper, stored in a secure location, should you have any concerns that the password manager won\u2019t work when you need it to.\n\nMr. Kassel is a writer in New York.
