This settlement is not an admission of liability by the company.\n\nWhat happened in Las Vegas?\n\nAbout 22,000 people were attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip on 1 October 2017 when the gunman opened fire.\n\nStephen Paddock, 64, fired more than 1,000 rounds into the crowds from his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel, killing 58 people and wounding more than 422 others.\n\nMore than 800 were eventually injured in the panic that followed.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A year since America's worst ever mass shooting, Rosemarie Melanson has only just left hospital\n\nPolice stormed the hotel room minutes after he stopped firing and found he had killed himself. He had 23 weapons with him in the room.\n\nThere remains no official motive for the attack.", "description": "MGM Resorts owns the Mandalay Bay Hotel from where a gunman killed 58 people in October 2017.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0027/production/_109093000_056990834.jpg"}
