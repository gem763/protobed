(You can watch Biden do this again and again in the video above.)\n\n\u201cI know that the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d Biden said last week during the debate, referring to Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.), respectively. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack. I think Obamacare worked.\u201d\n\nIt has been a strategic move for Biden, who has made his campaign all about a binary choice between Trumpism and a return to the relative normalcy of the Obama years.\n\nEven as Biden says his campaign is not a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of the Obama administration, he has invoked Obama and his record more than any candidate during the first three debates.\n\nBiden has good reason to do this: Obama remains incredibly popular, especially among Democrats.\n\n60 percent of Americans approved of Obama\u2019s job performance when he left office, according to a January 2017 Washington Post-ABC News poll.\n\nOnly 2 percent of Democrats rated Obama\u2019s presidency as \u201cpoor,\u201d according to a May 2019 CBS News/YouGov poll.\n\n44 percent of Americans said Obama was the best president of their lifetime, according to a June 2018 Pew Research Center survey.\n\nBiden has tied himself to Obama in at least three campaign ads in 2019, a stark difference from when former vice presidents George H.W. Bush and Al Gore tried to distinguish themselves from their former bosses, as Politico\u2019s Ryan Lizza noted last week.\n\nWhen Democratic candidates have criticized Obama, and by extension Biden, they haven\u2019t reaped any rewards. Biden\u2019s national polling lead has remained steady, according to the RealClearPolitics average, while no candidate who criticized Obama during the first two debates sustained a polling bump.\n\nBy the third debate, Democrats had apparently learned their lesson.\n\nOf 16 non-Biden references by candidates to Obama during last week\u2019s debate, 13 were positive references to the 44th president.\n\nEmily Guskin contributed to this analysis.", "description": "On the 2020 campaign trail, former vice president Joe Biden is often quick to remind supporters of two things: Barack Obama was a great president, and he was Obama\u2019s vice president.", "authors": ["Jm Rieger", "Video Editor For The Fix", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zm3X5SzjA_RlEfGyzx6SmcL_H7U=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-16-2019/t_ae3c7f7129c34876845df8e8e634cab9_name_fa2e1f5c_d0db_11e9_a620_0a91656d7db6_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
