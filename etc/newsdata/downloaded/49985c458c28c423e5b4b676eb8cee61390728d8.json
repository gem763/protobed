After months of detention, he killed himself, ICE says.", "language": "en", "text": "Then, on Tuesday afternoon, he was found dead in his cell, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said. The agency said it was caused by \u201cself-inflicted strangulation,\u201d though the case remains under investigation.\n\nHernandez-Diaz, the second detainee to die in ICE custody this month, has a backstory that points to several new realities in the immigration system: An influx of Cubans, who are stuck in detention due to policy changes during the Obama administration. An increasing reliance by ICE on rural jails in Louisiana, where detainees charge they have been kept for months on end. And reports of deaths, suicide attempts, and hunger strikes from those detainees.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHernandez-Diaz\u2019s wife, Yarelis Gutierrez, told BuzzFeed News that the Cuban government persecuted her husband for criticizing the government and attempting to leave the country three times: twice in 1994, and again in 2001. Officials had imprisoned him for nine years, she said.\n\nFor decades after the end of the Cold War until the final days of the Obama administration, the United States bestowed special immigration privileges on Cubans fleeing the communist nation: Once they reached U.S. soil, according to a policy known as \u201cwet foot, dry foot,\u201d they could take advantage of a path to permanent legal residency.\n\nWithout that path, tens of thousands of migrants \u2014 many of them from Cuba \u2014 are coming to the U.S. as the couple appears to have: traveling to South America and then paying smugglers or following WhatsApp instructions through the Darien Gap, a treacherous section of tropical rainforest and marshland.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGutierrez didn\u2019t return messages late on Wednesday, but in a video she shared on social media, she recounted the couple leaving Cuba. It\u2019s not clear where the couple went next, but her posts on social media indicate that the couple fled to South America and then headed north to the U.S.-Mexico border. The woman\u2019s Facebook friends wrote about having met her while she was selling orange juice in Peru, or otherwise in Trinidad and Tobago and Argentina.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone through millions of struggles but thanks to God being with me, I got past them all,\u201d she said in the Facebook video, posted on June 13. \u201cI asked God to bring me here safely and healthily, for me to be able to cross the jungle without seeing any animals or coming across any dangers.\u201d\n\nIn the video, Gutierrez recalled how she and her husband were left alone during their trek by others in their group and forced to fend for themselves. When they reached Mexico, immigration officials detained them for five days and then allowed the couple to continue on their way north.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe went through terrible things,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we got to Mexico, it was hard for us. We didn\u2019t have economic means, but God always aided us, always found a way to help us. An outstretched hand always appeared.\u201d\n\nHernandez-Diaz and his wife legally entered in May, crossing a bridge into Texas, and asked for asylum. That path has become so common in recent months that thousands of Cubans are now waiting in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, across the banks of the Rio Grande and barely halfway away from downtown El Paso, to follow in their footsteps.\n\nAt the border, Hernandez-Diaz said he feared a return to Cuba, BuzzFeed News reported. By June, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials said that fear was considered \u201ccredible,\u201d according to an internal government report obtained by the website, after an interview at the start of the asylum application process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Gutierrez was released from detention, Hernandez-Diaz remained locked up by ICE. Officials took him to Richwood Correctional Center, a for-profit jail on the outskirts of Monroe, La., in the state\u2019s swampy and mostly rural northern region.\n\nRichwood is one of eight rural jails in the area that have begun immigrants in the past year, as ICE expands its local capacities and the state\u2019s criminal justice reforms cause facilities to empty out of regular prisoners. Out of 51,000 immigrants detained across the country this month, about 8,000 were held in Louisiana, according to the Associated Press.\n\nNathalia Rocha Dickson, a Louisiana immigration lawyer, said that conditions in these facilities are dire: Guards who don\u2019t speak Spanish and who are largely untrained, rotating in and out. Tasteless food served at strict meal times, and a commissary that\u2019s expensive or is unavailable entirely.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLaSalle Corrections, the private-prison company that runs Richwood and most of the other new facilities, has been accused of punishing detainees by putting them in solitary confinement. A representative for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment early on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe provide the highest levels of service to our population, consistent with ICE\u2019s detention standards, which in the industry is the gold standard,\u201d Scott Sutterfield, a development executive for the company, told WVLA last month.\n\nOne gay detainee told a Mother Jones reporter that he was kept alone for 40 days and started hearing voices. After being prescribed sleeping pills and Prozac in response to suicidal thoughts, he has spent the past two months with just one other person.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been torture for me,\u201d he said. \u201cTorture by ICE.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe agency said in a statement that it \u201cis firmly committed to the health and welfare of all those in its custody and is undertaking a comprehensive agency-wide review of this incident, as it does in all such cases.\u201d Statistically, it said, fatalities in ICE custody are \u201cexceedingly rare.\u201d\n\nIn September, a federal judge ruled that ICE was unlawfully refusing to let detainees held in the Deep South out on parole. None had been released at all this year, down from about 75 percent in 2016. In Hernandez-Diaz\u2019s case, ICE had rejected two of his requests to be released on parole.\n\n\u201cThis is what causes people to be hopeless and tired and stuck in the system,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cWhy are you keeping people stuck inside detention if they can fight their cases outside detention?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe said that she stopped accepting parole cases. \u201cTake your money elsewhere,\u201d she recalls telling possible clients, \u201cbecause there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll win.\"\n\nAD\n\nThat prolonged detention has led many of the Cuban asylum seekers to refuse meals or go on short hunger strikes in protest \u2014 including, reportedly, Hernandez-Diaz.\n\nOn Friday, Richwood separated him from the other inmates in response to his threats, BuzzFeed reported. While he had been seen eating that day and the day after, he had missed his ninth consecutive meal by Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe told me he was going to participate in a hunger strike because of the abuse he endured in detention,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cHe never said he was going to hurt or kill himself.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with a Mother Jones reporter, she expressed her outrage at her husband\u2019s death. \u201cToday, it was my husband, but how many have there been before?\u201d she said. \u201cHow many more will there be if we don\u2019t control this?\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Mother Jones reported, the gay man had tried to hang himself, too.\n\nAD", "description": "Roylan Hernandez-Diaz, who had been denied parole while detained at a for-profit facility in Louisiana, is the second person to die while in immigration custody this year.", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Reporter On The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jmbztllC367N81toFUNkLkBfNeQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EIFWM2HKRAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
