Giuliani\u2019s quest to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden were arrested late Wednesday on campaign finance charges.\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman introduced Mr. Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to a Ukrainian prosecutor to target Mr. Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter.\n\nThe charges against the pair, who were born in Ukraine but now live in Florida, appear to be unrelated to their Ukraine activities.\n\nThe prosecutors say the two men allegedly funneled foreign money to political campaigns. Charges against them include conspiracy and making false statements to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nBoth men have donated heavily to Republican campaigns. In May 2018, they gave $325,000 to a political action committee supporting the president, according to Federal Election Commission data.\n\nThey are expected to appear in court on Thursday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
