[The league has] been bringing quarterbacks out of retirement \u2015 guys who have said \u2018I don\u2019t want to play football anymore\u2019 have gotten calls about playing football and Colin hasn\u2019t,\u201d Reid told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see if it will be different this time,\u201d he added.\n\nThe New York Jets announced earlier this week that its third-string quarterback, Luke Falk, will start Sunday\u2019s game against the New England Patriots while the team\u2019s starting quarterback, Sam Darnold, recovers from mono.\n\nKaepernick, who famously led peaceful protests against social injustice by kneeling during the playing of the national anthem at NFL games, has remained unsigned by a team since he became a free agent after the 2016 season. The NFL has been widely accused of blackballing the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback for his protests.\n\nReid\u2019s comments gained traction on social media after Kaepernick\u2019s youth nonprofit Know Your Rights Camp tweeted a clip recorded by local station News Talk 1110 & 99.3 WBT.\n\nReid, who was the first NFL player to kneel alongside his then-teammate, joins the chorus of athletes and commentators who have reignited criticism that Kaepernick remains unsigned with the 2019 football season now underway.\n\nDomonique Foxworth, former NFL player and senior writer at The Undefeated, said on ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take\u201d this week: \u201cNo one with any good sense thinks that Colin Kaepernick is not talented enough to be in the league.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese individual owners are sending a message that they do not believe in the things he believes in strongly enough to put themselves out there,\u201d Foxworth later added.\n\nMany Twitter users, including Reid, have shared examples of Kaepernick\u2019s past game statistics to counter those who argue that the former 49ers player hasn\u2019t been signed by a new team over issues of talent.\n\nCam out w/foot injury. Colin Kaepernick, 31 years old, healthy, having led the 49ers to an NFC championship game, and a Super Bowl, can\u2019t get his call returned by a single team. https://t.co/ARvTp2Ty1u \u2014 Max Kellerman (@maxkellerman) September 17, 2019\n\nEarlier this month, Kaepernick posted a video on Instagram showing him training with Cleveland Browns receiver Odell Beckham Jr.\n\n\u201cStaying ready against the odds!\u201d he wrote in the post\u2019s caption.\n\nKaepernick\u2019s attorney Mark Geragos told USA Today on Tuesday that his client is \u201cactively, actively interested in trying to play in the NFL.\u201d", "description": "The Carolina Panthers safety joins others who've asked why the former 49ers quarterback hasn't been called back to pro football.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d83b6f2230000580557fda8.jpeg?cache=bahthfafa3&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
