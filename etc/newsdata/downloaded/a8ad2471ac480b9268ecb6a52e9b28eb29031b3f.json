Eliot Engel (D-NY), Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Elijah Cummings have chosen to release bits and pieces of the evidence gathered so far that favors their impeachment effort.\n\nEngel, Schiff, and Cummings are the committee chairmen leading the impeachment investigation.\n\nOn Monday, Breitbart News reached out to the House panels for comment on when, if ever, they plan to release the full transcripts, but they refused to answer.\n\nIrked by the Democrats\u2019 refusal to release the full transcripts, Republican lawmakers who witnessed the testimony first hand and pundits have called for the information to be made public.\n\nVia Twitter, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) on Saturday urged Democrats to release Volker\u2019s testimony \u2014 which lasted more than eight hours \u2014 \u201cso all can read it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe candidly [and] professionally obliterated the bogus charge\u201d by Democrats that President Trump made a quid pro quo offer to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHouse Dems should IMMEDIATELY release Amb Volker\u2019s several hour long transcribed interview so ALL can read it. He candidly & professionally OBLITERATED the bogus charge POTUS made a quid pro quo offer to Zelensky connecting aid to Ukraine with an investigation into Bidens. https://t.co/8zFSIoRHjX \u2014 Lee Zeldin (@RepLeeZeldin) October 6, 2019\n\nIt's been 24 hrs & the Volker transcript still hasn't been released by House Dems. No good reason why this hasn't been done yet. Anything to keep the Schiff quid pro quo fairy tale alive one more night. These tactics are unfair to the American public & dividing our great country. pic.twitter.com/xNTfJeEBUc \u2014 Lee Zeldin (@RepLeeZeldin) October 5, 2019\n\nAn intelligence community \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claimed Trump pushed Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in exchange for foreign aid during a July 25 call.\n\nThe allegation triggered the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn Friday, Zeldin stressed on Twitter, \u201cVolker was very clear yesterday in his testimony that it is untrue Trump demanded a quid pro quo of Zelensky that U.S. aid was contingent upon an investigation by Ukraine into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Zeldin noted:\n\nIt\u2019s been[three] days [and Rep Schiff] still hasn\u2019t released the transcript of Amb Volker\u2019s interview, instead just cherry-picking some texts. I don\u2019t have to ask why, [because] I was there [with] both of them [Thursday]. Schiff\u2019s not releasing it [because] it obliterates his fairy tale quid pro charge.\n\nIt's been 3 days & @RepAdamSchiff still hasn't released the transcript of Amb Volker's interview, instead just cherry picking some texts. I don't have to ask why, bc I was there w both of them Thurs. Schiff's not releasing it bc it obliterates his fairy tale quid pro charge. \u2014 Lee Zeldin (@RepLeeZeldin) October 6, 2019\n\nOn Monday, Zeldin blasted the media\u2019s lack of interest in the full transcript of the impeachment inquiry\u2019s first witness, choosing instead to rely on the Democrats for details.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter:\n\nFascinating that much of the media has had zero interest in reporting on what was actually said by [Amb.] Volker last Thursday in response to several hours of questioning by [Democrats] & GOP. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t want to hear any truths that don\u2019t support Schiff\u2019s quid pro quo fairy tale.\n\nFascinating that much of the media has had zero interest in reporting on what was actually said by Amb Volker last Thursday in response to several hours of questioning by Dems & GOP.

Jim Jordan (R-OH), the founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, also called on the Democrats to release the full transcript of Volker\u2019s testimony.\n\nJordan wrote on Twitter Sunday, Volker was \u201cvery clear: no quid pro quo of any kind.The American people should see all of Amb. Volker\u2019s testimony. Will [Rep. Schiff] let them?\u201d\n\nAmbassador Volker was very clear: Burisma had a history of corruption and was inextricably linked to the Ukrainian government. He was also very clear: no quid pro quo of any kind. The American people should see all of Amb. Volker's testimony. Will @RepAdamSchiff let them? pic.twitter.com/XBn8u5sfYI \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 6, 2019\n\nHe added in a different tweet, \u201cThe media is giving legitimate corruption concerns a total pass, misconstruing the facts, and helping further [Rep. Schiff\u2019s] impeachment agenda.\u201d\n\nIt is absolutely appropriate for the President to call for rooting out corruption in any country with whom we do business. The media is giving legitimate corruption concerns a total pass, misconstruing the facts, and helping further @RepAdamSchiff\u2019s impeachment agenda. https://t.co/PmEuXcYiT2 \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 6, 2019\n\nEchoing his colleagues, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), wrote on Twitter Friday:\n\nAmbassador Volker\u2019s full interview yesterday directly undermined the salacious impeachment narrative Democrats are trying to sell you. They don\u2019t want you to see that. It\u2019s why they\u2019re leaking supplemental documents and text messages out of context.\n\nLike Jordan and Zeldin, Meadows also witnessed Volker\u2019s testimony first hand.\n\nDemocrats chose to remain mum after sitting through hours of testimony by Volker.\n\nMeanwhile, their Republicans colleagues \u2014 Meadows, Jordan, and Zeldin \u2014 told reporters the interview failed to produce the fireworks expected by their rivals.\n\nLast week, Fox News revealed that IG Atkinson testified Friday that he had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d contacts with the House intelligence panel aide.\n\nThe New York Times reported last Wednesday that the CIA officer who blew the whistle alleging a quid pro quo discussed the accusations against Trump with the House panel before the inspector general received the complaint.\n\nAccording to the law governing whistleblowers in the intelligence community, an official concerned about wrongdoing within the government must go to the IC inspector general before the congressional panels.", "description": "House Democrats are trying to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump based on information they are so far keeping secret from the public.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/wi/ap/22/e13a52_trump-russia-probe-democrats-19769-adam-schiff-in-22-2018-file-photo-rep.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
