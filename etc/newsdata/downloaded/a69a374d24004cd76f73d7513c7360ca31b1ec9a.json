In the French tradition, it is usual to give as a second Christian name the father's first name. 'Eduoard' is the French for 'Edward'.\n\nHaving searched the family records offices in Paris, Francois discovered that his grandmother had not declared the name of the father on Pierre-Edouard's birth certificate.\n\nAnd, to add further intrigue, Francois' mother received a Van Cleef and Arpels diamond bracelet and watch as a present when he was born in 1946 - based on an exclusive design created by the Duke of Windsor.\n\nA similar timepiece, once owned by the Duchess of Windsor, was sold at auction in 2011 for \u00a3286,000.\n\nFrancois' findings were originally published by Cherche Midi in his French-language memoir, The Man Who Should Have Been King, in 2016.\n\nBuckingham Palace told Mirror Online it did not wish to comment.", "description": "Francois Graftieaux, 73, claims his father was the product of 'one of the greatest royal sex scandals of living memory'", "authors": ["Jonathan Coles", "Image", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20590257.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_ROYAL_AFFAIR_001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
