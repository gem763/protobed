After a rain-sodden Friday, the conditions have improved drastically to provide the ideal backdrop for today's showdown. There's sun, highs of 24C and a scattering of grey clouds. That'll come as a huge relief for players and fans alike following yesterday's torrential downpours. As we gear-up for the clash, let's kick off proceedings with this preview from chief sports writer Jonathan Liew:\n\nEngland stand at gates of history in semi-final to define careers Hello all and welcome to The Independent's live coverage of this morning's Rugby World Cup semi-final between England and New Zealand.\n\n\n\nI'll be bringing you all the live action, reaction and analysis from Yokohama for what should be a memorable clash... so make sure to stay tuned!\n\nWhen is it?\n\nEngland vs New Zealand kicks off at 9am BST (5pm Japan Standard Time) on Saturday 26 October.\n\nWhere can I watch it?\n\nITV1 will be broadcasting the match. Alternatively, you can live stream it via the ITV Hub on your laptop, smartphone or tablet.\n\nWhat are they saying?\n\nMaro Itoje senses that England are poised to stun New Zealand in Saturday's World Cup semi-final by declaring: \"We're going to get them\".\n\nThe All Blacks are odds-on favourites to lift the Webb Ellis Trophy for a third successive time but at International Stadium Yokohama they face a clash between the sport's two highest-ranked teams.\n\nEngland are bullish over their chances knowing that coach Eddie Jones masterminded five wins over New Zealand when Australia coach, while 10 of the starting XV have tasted victory against the world champions.\n\nFor six of them that triumph was savoured on the Lions tour two years ago in the shape of a 24-21 win in Wellington - a match in which Itoje produced one of his most stellar performances.\n\n\"The whole touring experience of 2017 is a reference,\" the Saracens second row said.\n\n\"I learned a lot about New Zealand, their culture, how they play the game, how good and clinical they are and how to get them. This weekend feels like the time we're going to get them.\n\n\"Quite honestly, even if I hadn't experienced beating them, I'd still have that same confidence.\n\n\"My confidence doesn't derive from the 2017 Lions tour. Different team and different circumstances. Their team has changed a lot too.\n\n\"My confidence derives from the personnel we have, the confidence we have, the other players we have and what we are capable of.\n\n\"I have never ever gone into a game thinking that team is going to beat me. The way I see New Zealand, I respect what they have done but I don't see them as a team that is going to beat us.\n\n\"They are a very good team and have the capacity to do some very dangerous things, but I still believe that if we play our best rugby, we will win.\"", "description": "Follow live updates as\u00a0England\u00a0and New Zealand\u00a0go head to head\u00a0in the first semi-final of the Rugby World Cup.
