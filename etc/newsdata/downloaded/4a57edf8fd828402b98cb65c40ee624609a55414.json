REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo\n\nWith the Brexit crisis deepening and parliament suspended, lawmakers are scrambling to find ways to prevent a disruptive no-deal Brexit at the end of October, which they say would hurt businesses, drive up job losses and deepen divides in Britain.\n\nThey have passed a law to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask for a delay to Brexit if there is no deal, a move he says will tie his hands in talks but one which many lawmakers hope might make him focus on securing an agreement with Brussels.\n\nThe group of Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat lawmakers, called \u201cMPs (members of parliament) for a deal\u201d, said it would try to rally support for an agreement based on one former leader Theresa May had worked on with the opposition Labour Party.\n\nCaroline Flint, a Labour lawmaker who previously voted in favour of May\u2019s deal, said the group would use \u201cthe hours, the days, the weeks left\u201d before the Brexit deadline of Oct. 31 to show the \u201csizeable voice\u201d in parliament for a deal.\n\n\u201cWe are all in support of getting a deal and leaving in an orderly way,\u201d she told a news conference, adding there were about 50 Labour lawmakers who wanted a deal. \u201cWe may not be as loud as some voices but we are a voice of reason here.\u201d\n\nShe said talks between May and Labour had been successful in fleshing out some common ground on Brexit and that the result of those contacts should form a basis for any deal Johnson secures.\n\nStephen Kinnock, another Labour lawmaker, described the group\u2019s job as showing Johnson \u201cthat the numbers are there\u201d to get such a deal through parliament.\n\n\u201cOur job as MPs for a deal is to work relentlessly over the next few weeks, getting it out there to our colleagues and saying \u2018sign this bit of paper which says we will vote for a deal,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nBut a spokesman for the prime minister said Johnson was working on making progress in areas which differed from some of the things May had talked about before she resigned.", "description": "Several British lawmakers launched a new group on Tuesday to bolster efforts to secure a deal to leave the European Union, hoping to persuade parliament finally to pass an agreement based on one it rejected three times.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428319973&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8915Y", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
