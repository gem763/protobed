Do you know that we control the Senate Intelligence Committee? Our good friend Lindsey Graham \u2014 are you not chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee? Then why the hell aren\u2019t you issuing subpoenas like Elijah Cummings? Why the hell aren\u2019t you issuing subpoenas like Jerry Nadler and all the rest of them? Why aren\u2019t you getting to the bottom of all this? You have real, live corruption. Obstruction. Blackmail. That\u2019s with Ukraine. Wait until we get to China: 1.5 billion dollars.\u201d\n\nDemocrats contend that Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call is tantamount to an impeachable offense because he mentioned an investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s ties to a Ukrainian energy company that was quashed.\n\nOfficial transcripts of the call include the president saying: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that [Joe] Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. See if you can look into it\u2026.it sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division concluded that President Trump did not violate campaign finance laws.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what the media think,\u201d Mr. Levin said of recent news cycles. \u201cSee that over my shoulder [the book \u2018Unfreedom of the Press\u2019]? We know that they\u2019re incapable of covering this because of their ideology, but the truth shall set us free. I understand what the Democrats are doing in the House. I understand. They want to destroy the president. They\u2019re using their committees as opposition research. They\u2019re circling the wagons. They\u2019re trying to immunize Biden. What\u2019s going on in the Republican senate? \u2026 Oh, Hunter Biden, we can\u2019t touch him. But Don Jr., and Eric, and Jared Kushner and Ivanka \u2014 they\u2019re free game? Hell no. We should turn the script. And here\u2019s the difference: Biden is corrupt, Trump is not.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
