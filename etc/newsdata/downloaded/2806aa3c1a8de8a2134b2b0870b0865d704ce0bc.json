Kelly' creator drops out of women's summit over Kirstjen Nielsen's participation", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cSurviving R. Kelly\u201d filmmaker Dream Hampton said Friday that she is dropping out of an upcoming women\u2019s conference in D.C. because Kirstjen Nielsen, President Trump\u2019s former homeland security secretary, is slated to speak.\n\n\u201cSharing a stage with Nielsen, who separated immigrant families and put babies in cages, would have put a stamp of approval on her immoral and reprehensible actions and help legitimize the terror that Trump is inflicting on immigrants and communities of color,\u201d Ms. Hampton said in a statement to HuffPost. \u201cSo I\u2019m cancelling my attendance and encourage other speakers to do the same.\u201d\n\nMs. Hampton, who was recently named one of Time magazine\u2019s most influential people in the world, was scheduled to sit on a panel about \u201cjustice and power\u201d at Fortune\u2019s Most Powerful Women Summit in Washington on Tuesday. In her statement explaining her decision to drop out, Ms. Hampton said the former Trump official\u2019s presence at the summit would amount to \u201creputation rinsing.\u201d\n\n\u201cReputation rinsing \u2015 using visible, celebratory platforms to restore and normalize monstrous abuse \u2015 was actually common practice for predators like R Kelly and Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d she said in her statement. \u201cWhen every infant, toddler, child and teenager Nielsen is responsible for ripping from their families is released and reunited, when attempts at restitution are made, then perhaps she can face one of them for a public \u2018interview.\u2019\u201d\n\nMs. Nielsen is still listed as a speaker at the summit.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
