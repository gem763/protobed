The European media was almost unanimous in its praise of the 2017/18 PSL footballer of the season award winner, with the Belgian press going as far as rating the performance of the Club Brugge striker seven out of 10.\n\nTau\u2019s vision and quality on the ball contributed to Brugge getting a point off a star-studded Real Madrid \u2013 who are coached by the legendary Zinedine Zidane \u2013 in their own back yard at Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u.\n\nHowever, the rave reviews don\u2019t mean Tau is suddenly a world beater. To earn such a ranking, Tau is well aware that he must perform consistently at the highest level for a number of years.\n\nNevertheless, Tuesday\u2019s game gave a strong indication that he has the talent to aim for such a status.\n\nTau\u2019s modesty and bravery also set him apart from many of his peers.\n\nSupplied\n\nI observed the same qualities in the late Bafana Bafana defender Jacob Lekgetho, who I was privileged to write a story about while he was plying his trade at Lokomotiv Moscow in Russia.\n\nLike Tau, Bobo \u2013 as the dreadlocked player was fondly called \u2013 also played against the yesteryear superstars of Madrid in the Champions League.\n\nLekgetho did not let fame go to his head, and nor did Bennett Mnguni, who even scored against Madrid in 2002.\n\nBut if there is one thing that would help Tau prolong his stay abroad, it would be to embrace the culture and language of his adopted home.\n\nLekgetho spoke fluent Russian. The same can be said about the band of South African players who played in Turkey after the country\u2019s readmission to international sports, including Maimane Phiri, Fani Madida and Steve Komphela, to name but a few. They were true ambassadors.\n\nIn the midst of the hype of witnessing Tau outfoxing accomplished defenders such as Sergio Ramos and company on Tuesday, the banter between South Africans and Brugge on social media added a nice flavour to the Tau euphoria.\n\nThrough its official Twitter account, Club Brugge won our hearts with its tongue-in-cheek post on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cSooo, does our performance last night have anything to do with the Twitter outage?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at you, South Africa,\u201d noted the Belgians, much to the delight of Mzansi.\n\nIn the South African public, Brugge can claim to have an unofficial supporters\u2019 club in Africa.\n\nThanks for playing along, Club Brugge. We hope coach Philippe Clement will once again acknowledge the importance of having Tau in the starting line-up against a Neymar-led Paris Saint-Germain on October 22.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @DanieMothowagae\n\n\n\n", "description": "In a week during which Team SA failed to fire at the IAAF World Athletics Championships in Qatar, one individual ignited some hope for a country desperately searching for new sports heroes.", "authors": ["Daniel Mothowagae"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9127/f697281ae87d497a826c841d5bb4760a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
