As he explained it to reporters shortly afterward:\n\n\u201cThe door opens. I\u2019m within arm\u2019s length of the door, about 3 feet away from the door, and there\u2019s a kid with a gun \u2015 a shotgun,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cIn a fraction of a second, I analyzed everything really fast. I saw the look in his face, look in his eyes, looked at the gun, realized it was a real gun and then my instincts just took over. I lunged for the gun, put two hands on the gun.\u201d\n\nAs students screamed and began to run for their lives, Lowe, a football coach and unarmed security officer, said he remained focused on pointing the gun away from people before seizing it.\n\nNow, school surveillance footage obtained by local news station KOIN 6 has revealed the radical empathy that overtook Lowe in the moments afterward, when he spoke to the gunman and wrapped him in a hug.\n\nBreaking News: video of Coach Keanon Lowe disarming Parkrose High School gunman Angel Granados-Diaz.

Another teacher takes the gun from Lowe and hurries it away. Granados-Diaz kept repeating himself, saying he did not want to hurt anyone but himself, Lowe told Sports Illustrated.\n\nAt one point the student yelled, \u201cNo one cares about me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI care about you,\u201d Lowe said, he told the magazine. When the teen questioned him, he responded, \u201cI do, bro! That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I got you, buddy.\u201d\n\nParkrose High School football coach Keanon Lowe talks to reporters before Game 4 of the NBA basketball playoffs Western Conference finals between the Portland Trail Blazers and the Golden State Warriors on May 20, 2019, in Portland, Oregon.

Police officers eventually arrived to arrest the teen.\n\nLowe told reporters shortly after the incident that he felt \u201ccompassion\u201d for Granados-Diaz.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, especially when you\u2019re young, you don\u2019t realize what you\u2019re doing until it\u2019s over, right?\u201d he said, adding that young people face issues surrounding mental health and easy access to guns that must be addressed.\n\nInvestigators say Granados-Diaz brought the weapon to Parkrose loaded with only one round, meant for himself. His lawyer said he was drunk at the time.\n\nGranados-Diaz, now 19, pleaded guilty to gun possession charges earlier this month and was not sentenced to time behind bars. Instead, he was ordered to undergo mental health treatment and put on probation for 36 months.\n\nLove HuffPost?
