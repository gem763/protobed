I normally stick with black or muted colours but the royal blue colour called to me.\n\n\"I'm so glad I went with that one. It fits great and I love the pockets.\n\n\"I'm 5'6\" and about 170lbs, so I was't sure how a dress like this would fit o me, but the fabric hit at all of the right places with the help of some Spanx, it worked really well.\"\n\nThe woman added: \"I actually wore it to my father's funeral and many people commented on how it was the perfect colour on me. Would definitely buy again.\"\n\nOver on Reddit, the post has received over 500 up votes and dozens of comments.\n\nOne user commented: \"You think she'd have snapped a pic in the mirror at home.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAnother wrote: \"I'm ashamed to say I ordered one after reading this review.\"\n\nA third joked that the dress was \"to die for\".\n\n\"Is taking a picture next to the casket smiling something people actually do or...,\" asked a different user.\n\nSomeone else just had a lot of questions. They said: \"'I normally stick with black or muted colours'... wears bright blue to a burial. I know wearing black isn't the only acceptable colour and there can be good reasons for not wearing it but now I have questions about the photo, the comment, their life choices...\"", "description": "A woman's Amazon review for a dress has baffled fellow shoppers as it featured an unexpected picture", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20704888.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Amazon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
