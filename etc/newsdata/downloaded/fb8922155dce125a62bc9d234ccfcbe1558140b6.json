REUTERS/Tom Brenner\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday he would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to hold a trial if the House of Representatives decides to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Democratic-led House initiated an impeachment inquiry against Trump, a Republican, on Tuesday after a whistleblower report raised concerns that he tried to leverage nearly $400 million in U.S. aid in exchange for a political favor from Ukraine\u2019s leader.\n\n\u201cI would have no choice but to take it up,\u201d McConnell told CNBC.\n\nIf the House approves bringing charges, known as \u201carticles of impeachment,\u201d against a president the process moves to the Senate which holds a trial to determine the president\u2019s guilt.\n\n\u201cUnder the Senate rules, we are required to take it up if the House does go down that path. \u201cThe Senate impeachment rules are very clear,\u201d McConnell said in an interview.\n\nAccording to a Republican Senate leadership aide, any senator could attempt to have the articles of impeachment dismissed in the early stages of the trial, which would trigger a vote with a majority of the Senate needing to vote in favor for it to succeed.\n\n\u201cHow long you\u2019re on it, is a whole different matter, but I would have no choice but to take it up,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nThere has been speculation over whether McConnell, who has defended fellow Republican Trump, would try to find a way to avoid a Senate trial. The Senate leader controls what is to be debated on the Senate floor and sets the schedule for those debates.", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday he would have \"no choice\" but to hold a trial if the House of Representatives decides to impeach President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435590584&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T15Y", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
