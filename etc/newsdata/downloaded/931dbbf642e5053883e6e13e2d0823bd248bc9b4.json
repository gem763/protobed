Pacific island populations are dependent on shipping for travel, medicines, their livelihoods and connection to the outside world.\n\n'Save us, save the world': Pacific climate warriors taking the fight to the UN Read more\n\nSuch countries are precariously dependent on imported fossil fuels and acutely vulnerable to price shocks or supply disruptions. The region imports 95% of its fuels. Imported petroleum accounts for an average of 40% of GDP in Pacific island countries, with the transport sector the largest fuel user.\n\nIn archipelago states of small island populations spread over vast ocean distances, sea travel is vital for linking communities and for economic development. The lack of regular connectivity between islands is a major constraint on domestic, social and economic development and on international trade.\n\nQ&A Which countries contribute most to the climate crisis? Show Hide China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint.\n\nThe climate crisis is making travel significantly more difficult and disrupted. Rising sea levels and the increased frequency of dangerous weather are making sea journeys more difficult and slower, leading to more frequent cancellations of journeys and damaging ageing transport infrastructure such as ports and refuelling facilities.\n\nA joint Fiji-Marshall Islands government briefing paper said that compared with other major economic sectors, \u201cinvestment in the sustainable development of sea transport for Pacific island countries has been extremely limited to date\u201d.\n\n\u201cA transition to sustainable, resilient and decarbonised sea transport at this scale will require substantial investment, including at least $500m to support implementation of the 10-year work programme.\u201d\n\nThe Marshall Islands environment minister, David Paul, told a forum at the UN climate action summit in New York that securing funding would spark a \u201crapid transformation of our \u2026 shipping sector\u201d.\n\nThe Pacific is estimated to contribute just 0.03% of global emissions, but in many instances is feeling the impacts of climate change first and most acutely. Sea levels have risen at nearly four times the global average rate in some parts of the western Pacific, and the increased frequency of natural disasters has weakened island nations\u2019 ability to recover from repeated, worsening catasrophes.\n\nFiji\u2019s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, said in May that the globe\u2019s major emitters and largest economies were not contributing enough to help the Pacific adapt to climate change.\n\n\u201cWe need major economies to strengthen their climate finance investments, including their replenishment of adaptation and green climate funds. It is the defining crisis of our time. And if we do not take action, that crisis will soon escalate into chaos that will consume the entire world.\u201d\n\nHe said Pacific dependence on shipping \u201cdemands a transformation of our maritime sectors which will require new kinds of financial partnerships with bilateral and multilateral assistance and, potentially, a regional blue shipping bond\u201d.\n\nA blue bond is a debt instrument issued by governments, development banks or others to raise capital to finance marine- and ocean-based projects that have positive environmental, economic and climate benefits.\n\nThe Seychelles last year launched the world\u2019s first sovereign blue bond, a $15m 10-year bond to protect marine environments and safeguard fisheries.\n\nDr Peter Nuttall, a scientific and technical adviser for the Micronesian Center for Sustainable Transport at the University of the South Pacific, told the Guardian that shipping was the \u201cabsolute lifeline\u201d of any Pacific community.\n\n\u201cWithout shipping, our economies die, our people can\u2019t survive. In places like the Solomon Islands or the Marshall Islands, 80% to 90% of all goods arrive by ship. We have the most expensive shipping in the world, the longest transport routes, and the worst ships.\u201d\n\nHe said the Pacific was acutely vulnerable to oil shocks, citing examples from remote Pacific islands where critical services, such as visits by health professionals, had to be abandoned because fuel prices were too high.\n\nNuttall said the Pacific \u201ccannot wait for the rest of the world. We have to bespoke design a Pacific solution if it is going to work, not leave the Pacific to languish.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running the biggest risk. The Pacific did nothing to cause climate change, but we\u2019re about to get smashed by it. What is it we can practically do to make people\u2019s lives better now? We know the answers, and we don\u2019t have time to wait.\u201d", "description": "Coalition of six nations aims to raise funds and achieve full decarbonisation by 2050", "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cff9d8adabd346d28f71e9489429135a7553923d/255_635_3997_2398/master/3997.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e402195063e1292cda110d78adf9b1ff", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
