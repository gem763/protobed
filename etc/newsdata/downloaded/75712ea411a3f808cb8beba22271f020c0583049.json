Someone on her account sold stories on my mate end of pregnant or not! Coleen was pregnant when some of these stories came out'.\n\nAt war: Coleen, 33, accused Rebekah of leaking false stories to the press, Danielle, 35, came forth with similar claims leading to a row between the duo on social media (pictured 2017)\n\nAmid the drama last week, Danielle appeared on TV to express her opinion on the WAG war, and hinted she had a similar experience with Rebekah in the past.\n\nHowever Jamie's wife was quick to retaliate, as she took to Twitter to claim that Danielle's admission was 'utter b******s' and their feud was sparked by her refusal to try and find Danielle a man following her split from Jamie [O'Hara].\n\nIn what has become a War of the WAGs, Coleen released an incredible social media statement aimed at Rebekah in which she revealed she set up an elaborate sting on Instagram to 'catch' who was leaking fake stories.\n\nSubsequently Nicola issued a warning to Coleen about stressing out an expectant mother, as she said: 'Coleen doing this is not okay... Something is going to happen to a pregnant woman and a baby!'\n\nColeen's dramatic revelation enthralled Britain and sparked an angry denial from pregnant Rebekah, who said 'I don't need the money\u2019 and pointed out other people have had access to her Instagram account.\n\nThe wife of Jamie Vardy has now given an interview with The Daily Mail, in which she insisted arguing with Coleen is akin to rowing 'with a pigeon'.", "description": "Danielle Lloyd has reignited her war of words against Rebekah Vardy.", "authors": ["Connie Rusk For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/09/19731136-0-image-a-19_1571129964660.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
