With over 350 pieces, it\u2019s the biggest show of its kind, and the brand is going all-in to court the luxury consumer in China. Last week\u2019s opening party featured Brie Larson, iconic Chinese actress Gong Li, Taiwanese actor Mark Chao, Korean actress Kim Tae Ri, and Japanese model Kiko Mizuhara, plus influencers like Vanessa Hong, Sami Miro, and DJ twins Simi Haze.\n\nThe exhibit takes place at the Fosun Foundation, an art space located at the Bund. The sensory experience begins from afar \u2014 after sunset the building is lit up in the brand\u2019s signature shade of blue, which blends seamlessly into the neon skyline. Upon entry, visitors find themselves in the \u201cBlue Is the Color of Dreams\u201d room, which is filled with blue gemstones: sapphires, diamonds, and tanzanite (a stone that the brand introduced in 1968). Miniature reproductions of the brand\u2019s Fifth Avenue windows, with designs by the pop artists Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg from the 1950s, are displayed alongside more contemporary creations.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Tiffany & Co.\n\nAlso in the room is \u201cThe World of Tiffany\u201d wall, which includes pieces dating back to the brand\u2019s first days. From the original 1837 cash ledger to one of the first receipts and engagement-ring boxes, it\u2019s made for history buffs. Another cool detail? You can also see brooches worn by the likes of Elizabeth Taylor and Jacqueline Onassis.\n\nVisitors then move on to \u201cThe Tiffany Blue Book,\u201d which used to refer to the brand\u2019s mail-order catalogue and now is shorthand for their most elaborate jewels. Launched in 1837, the catalogue was the first of its kind in the United States. Every version of the book is presented, alongside a key piece from that year. If you ever wondered what the Spanish and French crown jewels looked like, this is the room where you\u2019ll find the answer.\n\nAnd speaking of engagement rings, the next room, \u201cTiffany Love,\u201d is filled with them. Not only can viewers gawk at the massive stones, but they can also try them on. Several stations are set up so visitors can slip on substantive diamond rings. (Naturally, the lighting is optimized for Instagram.)\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Tiffany & Co.\n\nNext up is a room that pays homage to Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, which includes Audrey Hepburn\u2019s original script, unseen photos from the set, as well as a modern-day interpretation of Hepburn\u2019s famous little black dress. The brand tapped local artist Li Xiaofeng to create a version made from shattered pieces of black porcelain.\n\nAnd finally, the last room is an ode to diamonds. From the flapper headband seen in The Great Gatsby to the delicate tiara Elle Fanning wore in the brand\u2019s ads to a Frank Gehry\u2013designed headpiece, it\u2019s by far the sparkliest room. To cap it all off, prior to exiting visitors can get up close to the massive yellow diamond worn by Lady Gaga at the Oscars. Discovered in 1877, the 128-carat stone is a dramatic way to finish a visit.\n\nThe show runs through November 10. Given China\u2019s propensity for luxury, it\u2019s a brilliant way to introduce Tiffany\u2019s history to the local consumer. Sadly, there are no plans to bring the exhibit to the United States in the near future, but you can scroll through the gallery below to check it out.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Tiffany & Co.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Tiffany & Co.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Tiffany & Co.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Tiffany & Co.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Tiffany & Co.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Tiffany & Co.", "description": "Tiffany & Co. opened a new exhibition in\n    Shanghai, called \u201cVision & Virtuosity,\u201d celebrating the iconic jeweler\u2019s greatest creative masterpieces over the last 180 years.", "authors": ["Diana Tsui"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/20/tiffany-and-co/LEDE---Tiffany-Vision-_-Virtuosity---Entrance-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
