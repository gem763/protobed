(U96.SG) and its drilling rigs builder unit jumped after Singapore's state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. announced a bid to acquire a controlling stake in local conglomerate Keppel Corp. (BN4.SG).\n\nMarket analysts said Temasek's potential controlling stake in Keppel could pave the way for a merger of Singapore's two largest shipyards -- Keppel Offshore & Marine Ltd. and Sembcorp Marine Ltd. (S51.SG). Temasek owns about 50% of Sembcorp Industries, Sembcorp Marine's parent.\n\nA larger stake in Keppel would give Temasek more flexibility to steer the consolidation of Singapore's offshore-and-marine industry, at a time when Chinese and South Korean shipyards are doing the same, Singapore-based brokerage KGI Securities said in a research note.\n\nTemasek earlier Monday announced a US$3 billion bid to buy an additional 30.55% stake in Keppel, taking its total holding in the property-to-marine conglomerate to 51%.\n\nSembcorp shares gained 11%, while Sembcorp Marine was up 13%. Trading in Keppel shares was halted before the announcement.\n\nWrite to Ben Otto at ben.otto@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 21, 2019 05:24 ET (09:24 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
