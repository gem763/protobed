I'm 32, but I feel better than some 25, 26 year-olds. Maybe it's because I don't have kids. I'm playing the best football of my career and I intend to play well for a long time.\n\n'Of course I think about Maradona's record. Everyone's talking about it! I'm very proud about getting so close to a legend like Diego.\n\n'I can only say that I want to stay at Napoli, but right now I can't say any more than that.'\n\nMertens has scored five goals this season and is one away from Deigo Maradona's record\n\nMertens has insisted he will not be drawn out to Asia by big money should he become a free agent in the summer and wishes to remain playing in Europe.\n\nHowever, he admitted it would be unlikely he would join another Serie A side, putting Premier League, La Liga and Bundesliga clubs on red alert.\n\nHe added: 'If I leave Napoli, I'll miss everything. I certainly don't see myself signing for another Italian club. It would make me feel strange because I feel at home in Naples.\n\n'I also don't see myself signing for a club in China or Qatar: like I said, I hope to play for as long as possible in Europe at the highest level. I don't think I'll finish my career in Belgium.'", "description": "Dries Mertens has\u00a0put the ball in Napoli's court after declaring that he would like to stay beyond this summer.
