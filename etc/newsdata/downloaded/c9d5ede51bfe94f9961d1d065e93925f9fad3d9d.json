My client is desperate.'\n\nThe court heard the couple married in 2006 when Dr de Filippo, now a British citizen and immunologist at University College London, was researching for her PhD at Cancer Research UK in the capital.\n\nHowever, their married life together only really began when they purchased their Shepherds Bush home in 2009, she told the court.\n\nMr Manetta, an electronics developer and property manager, had inherited a fortune after the death of his uncle, Ignazio Falchero, in Italy. It included 68 properties, plus cash and other investments worth about 3 million euros, the court heard.\n\nSome of the cash was ploughed into the \u00a3540,000 house purchase, with the rest funded by a loan secured against bonds which had also been bought with his uncle's money.\n\nDr de Filippo, who at the time was pregnant with their child, insisted the plan was that the house would be their family home as they began their life together.\n\n'We wanted to stay here, live here and have a family here,' she told the judge.\n\nThe allegedly derelict house where Dr De Filippo and Mr Manetta lived as a married couple and which will now be sold\n\nHowever, the couple split in 2016, after which Dr de Filippo moved out with her child to live in rented accommodation in west London with her parents.\n\nThe former couple are still married, but have been 'judicially separated' by a court in Turin and Dr de Filippo is in the process of divorcing her ex in the UK.\n\nIn evidence, she said the once 'lovely' matrimonial home was abandoned with work half done on it and was left a 'disgraceful' eyesore for her former neighbours.\n\nBlaming her ex for the state of the property, she said he had failed to put up the money she claimed would be needed to make it habitable again.\n\n'When we bought it, it was a lovely house. You couldn't live there now, it's awful,' she said\n\n'It's a shame. It's ugly. It's full of stuff, pieces of wood that were supposed to be used for finishing the floor.\n\n'There's no central heating. There's no kitchen. It's a disgrace.\n\n'You can see from one floor to the other because bits of the floor have been removed.'\n\nHauling her ex to court, Dr de Filippo applied for an order that the house be sold so that she can get her hands on her half of the proceeds to buy a new home.\n\nBut Mr Manetta insisted that, despite being in joint names and their home while they were together, the house was intended as an investment and as a means of distancing some of his inheritance from rival claims.\n\nHe denied his ex was due anything from a sale and denied that the house is uninhabitable, claiming in court that he stays in an attic room there when he is in London.\n\nRuling against him, Judge Kent said: 'I do not find his explanation that he and his wife agreed to the property being put in joint names only to protect it from fraudsters in Italy convincing.'\n\nHe continued: 'It was intended from the outset to be their home in London, where Dr de Filippo at least had been living for some time and where it was expected she would remain and where they did stay for a number of years.\n\n'No doubt the investment potential of the property was an attractive feature of it, but most young couples buying a house to live in hope also that it will prove to be a good investment.'\n\nThe fact that they lived together as husband and wife in the house from when it was bought until their split was consistent with it 'having been bought as a family home at the outset,' he said.\n\n'In my judgment, at its highest, Mr Manetta may have himself thought that he would somehow always be able to lay claim to the whole of the property or the proceeds of its sale,' he continued.\n\n'Whether he did or not have that belief however, I am quite unable to find that it was an understanding shared by Dr de Filippo.'\n\nThe judge rejected Mr Manetta's claim to the entire house, meaning it can be sold and the proceeds split.", "description": "While multi-millionaire Luca Manetta jetted between London and his home in Italy, 'desperate' Dr Katia de Filippo had to lean on her elderly parents after her ex refused to sell their former home.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/09/19826436-0-image-a-21_1571300231415.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
