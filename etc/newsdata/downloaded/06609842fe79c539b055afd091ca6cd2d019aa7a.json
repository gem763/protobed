It looks like the update will introduce not only Leon and Claire as hunters but also give players the option to hunt as a zombie - complete with appropriately shambling animation.\n\nThen they all do a bit of dancing, which is about as Monster Hunter as you get.\n\nThe most WTF element here, however, is the incorporation of Mr. X \u2013 the nigh-unstoppable killer who hunts you down in Resi 2 - as your new hunter handler. This character gives you quests, appears in the base camp of missions and, while you're eating, stands at the side applauding and cooing.
