The day-in-the-life movie was shot in 1981, but remained unfinished and unreleased at the time due to money problems. It premiered for the first time in 2000, long after Basquiat's death in 1988.\n\nThe film captures the quirky flow of the city and the freewheeling enigmatic vibe that Basquiat later became known for. \"New York is my kind of town,\" he says in the beginning of the movie teaser. \"If you can make it there, you can sell people your unwanted hair.\" He says the city has \"a diamond brick road\" that he's off to see, foreshadowing his own real-life success which he willed into existence with his famous confidence.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be a day in the life of New York's 80s art scene if he didn't bump into people who would become famous one day. The movie also features appearances by artist and musician John Lurie as well as Fab Five Freddy, the graffiti artist who later hosted Yo! MTV Raps,the first rap show on MTV. And Basquiat also drops by some band performances from DNA, Kid Creole and the Coconuts, and James White and the Blacks. The script was written by Glenn O'Brien, an art-scene regular and friend of Andy Warhol. It was directed by Swiss photographer Edo Bertoglio.\n\nDowntown 81 will start showing at the Metrograph Theater on October 25 and will be released more broadly in November.\n\n\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Taylor Hosking on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "'Downtown 81' depicts a day in the young artist's life as he hustles in Manhattan's art scene.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da9d6d1419dca0009af5e64/lede/1571411859125-Jean-Michel.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.3751xh;0xw,0.0782xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
