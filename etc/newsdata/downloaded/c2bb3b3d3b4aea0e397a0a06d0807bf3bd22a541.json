Connor, who has been on as Mickey this afternoon, has been taken very ill all of a sudden.\n\n\u201cBut, we would love to give you the rest of the show. The only option for us to do that is to send one of our actors on with a script to read Mickey\u2019s lines.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are happy for us to do that, we will do that.\u201d\n\nThere was huge applause and the performance resumed minutes later, with McCourt doing an incredible job.\n\nAt the end of the performance, there was a huge standing ovation for McCourt and he was hugged and congratulated by fellow cast members.\n\nAudience member Nicola Carruthers, 61, praised his performance.\n\nShe said: \"I thought he was excellent. He really stepped up the challenge. He looked a bit emotional at the end and he deserved the standing ovation he got at the end.\"\n\nOriginally staged as a school play in Liverpool, Blood Brothers - the heart-breaking story of Mickey and Edward, two brothers separated at birth - was first seen in the West End in 1983 and is currently touring the UK.\n\nSuch is the award-winning musical\u2019s popularity, all performances at Derby Theatre have been sold out.", "description": "The performance of Blood Brothers at Derby Theatre was halted when understudy Connor Bannister became sick leaving no one to replace him", "authors": ["Paul Whyatt", "Lorraine King"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658824.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_bb1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
