The U.S. accused Iran of carrying out the attacks.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what steps the president directed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to take. Asked about the sanctions later Wednesday during stops in California, the president told reporters he would announce details over the next 48 hours. The Treasury Department, White House and State Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests to comment.\n\nThe strikes triggered the largest spike in crude prices in decades and renewed concerns of a budding conflict in the Middle East. All the while, Iran maintains that it was not behind the attacks.\n\nU.S. crude and benchmark global Brent oil prices dropped Wednesday after the White House announced sanctions instead of military action.", "description": "The unspecified action comes after the U.S. accused Iran of carrying out the weekend attacks on critical Saudi oil installations.", "authors": ["Amanda Macias Jacob Pramuk", "Amanda Macias", "Jacob Pramuk"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106136105-1568811357342gettyimages-1151703245.jpeg?v=1568811378", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
