English Housing Survey data shows that 19 per cent of urban homes are affordable, compared to nine per cent of rural homes.\n\nThe Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents around 30,000 landowners and rural business owners, has urged the government to change planning laws after 13 per cent of their members said they have used land on their estates to build homes for local people.\n\nThe deputy president of the organisation, Mark Bridgeman, built 39 homes on his land in Northumberland after plans to expand the village were rejected by the local authority.\n\nHe runs the Fallodon Estate, which is by the coast and consists of a farm, biomass electricity production centre, and now a housing estate.\n\nMr Bridgeman said: \u201cThankfully I have been successful in building homes on my land which has allowed the local village to grow and support local services. But I know from my conversations with many of our members over the last few years that it\u2019s an inconsistent picture across the country and in many instances a postcode lottery whether plans will be accepted.\n\n\u201cThe undeniable fact is we need more rural housing and the shortfall of affordable homes in rural communities has huge implications for social cohesion and the wider rural economy. If we are to encourage people with skills and talent to remain or move to the countryside, then we need to be able to build environmentally sustainable yet affordable homes that people want to live in.\u201d\n\nHe encouraged other landowners to build homes on their estates if possible, adding: \u201cWhat\u2019s often forgotten is that as local landowners and business people we have the interests of our local communities at heart. We could be driving growth in the rural economy and contributing to solving the national housing crisis, but instead many of our villages are stagnating.\u201d\n\nThe CLA is trying to encourage more of its members to build on their land to solve the rural affordable housing crisis, and has urged the government to put measures in place to help.\n\nThese include a conditional exemption from inheritance tax for affordable housing for the duration of the period that they remain let out as affordable homes. This would encourage landowners to build and rent out existing homes at affordable prices.\n\nThe president of the association, Tim Breitmeyer, said: \u201cI have fallen foul of the inflexible planning system stopping my plans to build a small increment of 12 homes, of which five were to be affordable, in my small village in Cambridgeshire. I know how frustrating it can be to have put forward sympathetic and appropriate proposals \u2013 which will enhance the local community, provide jobs and ensure affordable homes \u2013 only to be knocked back by administration and red-tape.\n\n\u201cWe need government to listen to the rural voice and allow us to build a sustainable number of appropriate and well-designed houses to support our villages\u2019 organic growth. A conditional exemption from inheritance tax for affordable housing could be one way of doing this. It would encourage landowners to build and rent out existing homes at affordable prices, bring people back to the countryside, help fill gaps in the seasonable workforce, whilst strengthening rural communities with new families.\u201d", "description": "Country estate owners are building affordable houses on their land to help local people get on the property ladder as they encourage others to do the same to help solve the housing crisis.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Tom Welsh", "Julie Burchill", "Simon Heffer", "Daniel Hannan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/18/286A8472-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZgEkZX3M936N5BQK4Va8RWtT0gK_6EfZT336f62EI5U.JPG?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
