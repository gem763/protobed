Brendan, who was axed from the popular dance show last year, poked fun at Strictly on social media following the duo's waltz to Send in the Clowns.\n\nHours after the show aired, the former Dancing with the Stars judge posted a clip of a routine to the same song from his show, Show Man, and penned alongside the video: 'I'm thinking my ideas are being lifted? Strictly.'\n\nThe post included a link to a website where his followers could watch his version of the dance.

Their children are also treated to access to a massive playground as their garden boasts an incredible trampoline\n\nHis accusation comes after he said his Strictly reputation of being difficult to work with 'hurt me to the bone'. Brendan, who starred on the BBC show for the first 15 series, reflected on his exit as he made his debut with Jeremy Edwards on Celebrity X Factor last week.\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror, Brendan said: 'One of the saddest things about leaving Strictly was a report claiming the production staff found me hard to work with, that hurt me to the bone.\n\n'Generally speaking I have a very good relationship with them and I would always make sure they were OK, I recognise what they do they work harder than anyone so that was a kick in the teeth.\n\nBrendan continued: 'I may have fallen out with a couple partners or had a go at someone for doing the wrong thing but I've never asked anyone for a coffee'. The New Zealand dancer added he was 'far from a diva' but admitted he has 'spent a lot of time as a character'.", "description": "The ballroom pro, 43, has given fans a glimpse into the home he shares with wife Zoe Hobbs and their children\u00a0Aurelia, six, and Dante, 19 months, in a series of pictures on his Instagram account.", "authors": ["Rianne Addo For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/19/19801920-0-image-a-43_1571251392053.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
