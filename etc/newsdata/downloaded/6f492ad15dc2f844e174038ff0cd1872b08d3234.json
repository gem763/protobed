I don\u2019t know how you get people to lose weight unless you say, come on. Enough.\u201d\n\nThe presenter also criticised plus-size models starring on magazine covers \u2013 a reference to his feud with model and body positivity advocate Tess Holliday over her October 2018 Cosmopolitan magazine cover.\n\n\u201cIs there a way to tackle chronic obesity, to stop putting massive models on the cover of magazines and say this ain\u2019t so great,\u201d Morgan argued.\n\n\u201cWe put people who are 320 pounds on the cover of glossy magazines and say \u2018isn\u2019t this empowering?\u2019 and this is the problem that Bill Maher has rightly identified to me.\u201d\n\nMorgan added that he would be \u201cquite happy\u201d if his co-host Susanna Reid fat-shamed him.\n\n\u201cI think the best way to lose weight is when someone goes, \u2018Blimey you\u2019ve put on a bit, son.\u2019 So you feel a bit insecure and then you go off and reduce one Big Mac a day to half a Big Mac, and so go you go on,\u201d the presenter said.\n\nA number of Twitter users have condemned Morgan\u2019s comments, with many calling for him to be held accountable for \u201cbullying tactics\u201d.\n\n\u201cFat shaming IS just another form of bullying,\u201d one person tweeted.\n\n\u201c@billmaher and @piersmorgan should be held accountable for their bullying tactics. It\u2019s not about being snowflakes either it just can damage someone\u2019s self esteem. Just have a thought about somebody else.\u201d\n\nAnother person agreed, adding: \u201cBullying. End of.\u201d\n\nWhile a third social media user wrote: \u201cNo shaming whatsoever is acceptable, as this leads to bullying and worse suicidal tendencies encouraging hatred.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, James Corden released a clip on YouTube from The Late Late Show with James Corden in which he addressed the derogatory remarks made by Maher.\n\nThe Gavin and Stacey chastised Maher, saying that fat-shaming \u201cnever went anywhere\u201d.\n\n\u201cI mean, ask literally any fat person,\u201d Corden said. \u201cWe are reminded of it all the time.\u201d\n\nThe presenter went on to explain that there is a \u201ccommon and insulting misconception that fat people are stupid and lazy\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is proven that fat-shaming only does one thing \u2013 it makes people feel ashamed,\u201d Corden added.\n\n\u201cAnd shame leads to depression, anxiety and self-destructive behaviour. Self-destructive behaviour like over-eating.\u201d", "description": "Piers Morgan has defended a US comedian who called for fat-shaming to \u201cmake a comeback\u201d.
