Hall/NBC via Getty Images\n\nSmaller than a suitcase but bigger than a tote, the classic duffel is a perfectly sized carryall for a long weekend. Peer out at a train platform full of city dwellers fleeing town on a Friday afternoon and you\u2019ll see all varieties of duffels, from waxed-canvas bags hearkening back to the style\u2019s military roots to luxe versions in buttery leather. To find the best duffel bags out there for travel, we asked frequent travelers, including writers, photographers, and a hotel exec, to recommend their favorites. Read on for their picks, which include duffels that convert to backpacks, duffels on wheels, and fancier leather styles that will only look better the more miles you clock with them.\n\nBest nylon duffel bags\n\nPatagonia Black Hole 55L Duffel Bag The Black Hole duffel lives up to its name, according to travel writer and photographer Michaela Trimble, who has toted it all over the world. \u201cIt fit everything I needed for a nearly two-month trip with room to spare,\u201d she told us after traveling with the bag to Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Madagascar. \u201cAnd it barely came back with a scratch.\u201d Laminated fabric and a water-repellent coating protect the duffel from the elements and any damage that may occur in transit, while keeping it lightweight (it\u2019s under three pounds). Trimble also notes that it \u201ccomes with padded straps, so it can easily and comfortably be carried as a backpack.\u201d Strategist senior editor Simone Kitchens also likes the Black Hole duffel, which she says makes a great carry-on. \u201cThere are one zillion separate little pockets and perfectly sized compartments for things like chargers and night guards and passports and AirPods, as well as slim sleeves for a laptop and magazines,\u201d Kitchens says. \u201cIt opens at the top, which means things won\u2019t come tumbling out when you need to grab something.\u201d $139 at Backcountry Buy\n\nTimbuk2 Impulse Travel Backpack Duffel Like the Black Hole bag, this duffel converts to a backpack but fits as much as a small suitcase. \u201cThe very considered design is ideal for someone who is most at home hopping on and off planes and trains,\u201d says Andrew Barker, the chief content officer of Prior travel club. He appreciates the bag\u2019s multiple compartments, such as the \u201czip-up shoe pockets at each end,\u201d and the \u201cTSA-friendly slip pockets [for] easy access to laptop and passport.\u201d In general, Timbuk2\u2019s bags have been on our radar for a while now \u2014 we\u2019ve written about their equally durable work backpacks, and contributor David Pogue loves his laptop-friendly Timbuk2 messenger bag (which he\u2019s carried for going on six years). From $189 at Timbuk2 Buy\n\nYeti Panga Airtight Waterproof Submersible Duffel Bag Another sporty duffel bag, this one comes from the makers of our all-time favorite cooler, can also be worn as a backpack, and is made from thick, laminated nylon that\u2019ll withstand any rough baggage handling. Strategist columnist Chris Black likes that it\u2019s \u201ca fully waterproof duffel bag\u201d that will keep your clothes dry whether you\u2019re tailgating or stuck in the rain. $300 at Amazon Buy $300 at Amazon Buy\n\nLongchamp Le Pliage Expandable Travel Duffel Nylon Weekender \u201cI look for a bag that can sit on top of my carry-on, fit a lot of items, and be easily stored when not in use,\u201d says Daniela Velasco, the creative director of Drift and Ambrosia magazines. That bag, for her, is Longchamp\u2019s Le Pilage tote because it carries her camera, laptop, chargers, and more and is water resistant, so she doesn\u2019t have to worry about rain damaging her expensive gear. This duffel is basically a larger version of Velasco\u2019s favorite tote: It\u2019s made of the same durable nylon and fits everything you\u2019ll need for a few days away. $255 at Bloomingdale\u2019s Buy\n\nBest canvas and twill duffel bags\n\nParavel Weekender Yolanda Edwards, founder of YOLO Journal travel magazine and the former creative director of Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, tells us people often stop to ask where her Paravel bag is from. While she has a (now out-of-stock) cherry-red weekender, we think this ivory one with black leather accents is equally striking. Plus, Edwards finds it very functional for flying. \u201cIt has a handy strap for slipping onto my suitcase handle, and if I\u2019m lazy, even just the handles work for that.\u201d She adds that \u201cit stands up on its own, and I like how tall it is \u2014 although if you want to keep it under the seat in front of you on a flight, you do have to push it down.\u201d $295 at Paravel Buy\n\nFilson Medium Rugged Twill Duffel Bag Another of Black\u2019s favorites, this handsome duffel is water resistant and designed to fit in overhead compartments. As he says, \u201c[It] will easily fit everything you need for a weekend of apple picking or skipping rocks on Long Island, without taking up too much space in a car or on a train.\u201d $395 at Filson Buy $395 at Backcountry Buy\n\nNisolo Luis Weekender If you\u2019re looking for a purchase you can feel good about, travel writer Jedidiah Jenkins recommends this weekender from Nisolo, which values fair trade and healthy working conditions for manufacturers. \u201cThey\u2019re a really dope company that prioritizes ethical supply chains,\u201d he says. In terms of functionality, Jenkins says the bag\u2019s interior pockets help him keep his stuff organized, and its removable cross-body strap allows for hands-free carrying. $248 at Nisolo Buy\n\nBest leather duffel bags\n\nJ.W. Hulme Classic Duffel If you have the money to spare, this classy leather duffel also recommended by Black will probably last for a lifetime of traveling. \u201cThe bag is beautiful, functional (it\u2019s carry-on appropriate and comes with a shoulder strap), lined with micro-suede, and has a U-shaped zippered entry to the main compartment for easy access,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can get it monogrammed for an extra $10.\u201d $995 at J.W. Hulme Buy\n\nAlex Weekender Cobalt Blue Elyse Eisen, a travel blogger and the founder of the Chain Collective PR agency, loves this bright-blue bag that\u2019s made in New York City by her friend and former client Alex Dabagh. \u201cI really put all my bags to the test with the amount of travel I do, and I recently took this on a monthlong trip to Croatia, Montenegro, Italy, Istanbul, and Amman,\u201d she says. Eisen likes that this duffel can be used as a carry-on when she flies and that it has a waterproof nylon lining for easy cleanup in the event of an unfortunate toiletry spill. $900 at Alex Made in NY Buy\n\nKenneth Cole Reaction Colombian Leather Duffel $148 (was $330, now 55% off) Given the price points of our cool people\u2019s favorite leather duffels, we felt it worth including this affordably priced one \u2014 which looks way more expensive than it actually is \u2014 for anyone who isn\u2019t ready to drop nearly $1,000 on a weekender. Because the leather is soft and slouchy, the already nice-looking duffel will probably look even better with age. $148 at Zappos Buy\n\nBest wheeled duffel bag\n\nThe North Face Rolling Thunder Wheeled Duffel Bag A fully loaded duffel bag can be a heavy burden to bear, but a bag with wheels takes the weight off your shoulders. Ben Pundole, the founder and editor-in-chief of hotel review site A Hotel Life and the vice-president of brand experience at Edition Hotels, trusts his wheeled North Face duffel because it has lasted through years of frequent travel. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite because it\u2019s indestructible,\u201d he said. \u201cWaterproof, durable, and most of all, dustproof.\u201d For a North Face duffel without wheels, Black recommends the brand\u2019s Base Camp duffel, which he says is up for anything. As he writes, \u201cGet in line to climb Mount Everest or head to Amagansett \u2014 either way, you\u2019re covered.\u201d $299 at Backcountry Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
