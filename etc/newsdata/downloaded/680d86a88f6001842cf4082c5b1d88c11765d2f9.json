The pumps supplied fuel from the main tank to the helicopter's twin engines.\n\nAthough he noted that the quantities of fuel displayed on the helicopter's gauges \"contradicted\" low fuel warnings, he said there were \"no defects\" in the helicopter's systems that contributed to the deaths.\n\nThe sheriff concluded that the \"simple\" reason for the tragedy's cause was Capt Traill taking a \"conscious decision\" to ignore the warnings. He said: \"It was a decision that had fatal consequences for 10 people.\"\n\nThe Pilot's Checklist stipulated that he should land the aircraft within 10 minutes of a fuel warning and the sheriff described Capt Traill's failure to follow that procedure as \"inexplicable\".", "description": "The Clutha helicopter crash that killed 10 people was caused by the pilot taking \"a chance\" that low fuel warnings were wrong, a fatal accident inquiry has found.", "authors": ["Simon Johnson", "Michael Hogan", "Janet Daley", "Maria Miller", "Con Coughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000214574042-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwtUT54c80eKHJHMfvK9NImtWLkXH92jWt3mkAOR8y98.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
