I don't think Tyga thought so many people would show up as it was a private party,' said Nicole.\n\n'The girls did not look happy and just stood with their arms crossed. Some had been doing their hair and makeup all day, and had made a real effort. Tyga wanted everyone to stay but the boat was at capacity.'\n\nNicole explained that the guest list consisted of friends of the rapper, such as herself, people that personally know his entourage, and then girls that were invited via a party promoter.\n\n'Happy': Jamie Lee Ruiz (pictured), one of Tyga's dancers, was seen bending over on deck while posing for one racy photograph\n\n'Yachtiana': Dancer Jamie's green bikini struggled to contain her ample assets as she posed for more photographs\n\nMeanwhile, music blogger Susziestar Bow posed for a picture clutching a champagne flute, wearing a bondage-style bikini top with snakeskin print trousers.\n\nJamie Lee Ruiz, another one of Tyga's dancers, bent over on deck while posing for one racy photograph, before almost busting out of her green bikini top.\n\nOther influencers and dancers in attendance included Tal Hymans, Yaz Tunchy and Soraya Boularas.\n\nMain man!

A deck hand helped another stunning woman join the party in Rose Bay\n\nSome attendees have demanded refunds, claiming they did not get their money's worth.\n\n'$80 to listen to DJs play the same damn songs for more than four hours and have him only play for like 15 minutes? I want a damn refund,' one woman said.\n\n'The poster only said Tyga, it didn't mention a DJ playing for five hours beforehand, otherwise no one would have showed up until 10pm,' another said.\n\n'They made out like it was all going to be Tyga and to only get 15 mins of him, for that price, is f***ed.'\n\nThe sub-promoter for the event told Daily Mail Australia that they purchased the show through entertainment agency Lucky Urbn, who had the responsibility of handling the logistics of the show and getting Tyga to the venue.\n\nKing!
