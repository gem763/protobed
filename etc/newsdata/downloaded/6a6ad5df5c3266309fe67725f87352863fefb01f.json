In early Asian trade on Monday, the dollar inched down to\n\n108.36 yen against the yen, while the euro stood at $1.1025\n\nversus the greenback, off Friday's three-week high of\n\n$1.10625.\n\nTokyo's market is closed for a public holiday on Monday, so\n\ntrading volumes are likely to lighter than usual.\n\nThe trade deal \"looks more symbolic than substantial, and\n\nmight be better described as simply an 'interim trade war\n\ntruce,'\" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National\n\nAustralia Bank.\n\n\"This Phase 1 agreement, if inked, does little to\n\nimmediately brighten the outlook for global trade and growth.\n\nWhile it shouldn't prevent the Fed from agreeing to cut rates by\n\nanother quarter point on Oct. 30, it doesn't provide a firm\n\npretext for significant or sustained U.S. dollar depreciation.\"\n\nThe deal represents the biggest step between the United\n\nStates and China in a 15-month trade dispute. Friday's\n\nannouncement did not include many details and Trump said it\n\ncould take up to five weeks to get a pact written. He\n\nacknowledged the agreement could fall apart during that period,\n\nthough he expressed confidence that it would not. The British pound surged on Friday to as high as $1.2708\n\nGBP=D4 , its strongest level since July 1, and a five-month\n\npeak of 86.955 pence per euro EURGBP=D4 , on optimism about\n\norderly Brexit.\n\nThe pound was last down 0.38% at $1.2600 in Asia.\n\nThe EU agreed on Friday to hold another round of intense\n\nnegotiations with London in a bid to break the deadlock and\n\nsecure a deal before the Oct. 31 deadline. EU negotiator Michel Barnier and his British counterpart\n\nStephen Barclay earlier held what both sides called a\n\n\"constructive\" meeting in Brussels. The British and Irish prime\n\nministers said on Thursday they had found \"a pathway\" to a\n\npossible deal, and by Friday some officials were expressing\n\nguarded optimism.\n\nOn Sunday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his\n\ncabinet a last-minute deal was still possible as the two sides\n\npressed on with intensive talks to try to avoid a disorderly\n\nBrexit on Oct. 31. Britain said there would be more talks on Monday, with\n\nJohnson hoping a deal will be agreed in time for EU leaders to\n\napprove it at a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday this\n\nweek.\n\nBut he will still have to convince a deeply divided British\n\nparliament to ratify the agreement, while the European\n\nCommission said \"a lot of work remains to be done\" in a\n\nstatement issued late on Sunday.\n\n\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Dollar holds near 2-1/2-mth yen high on U.S.-China partial deal, pound stands tall", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE0I024_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
