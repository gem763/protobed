Soldiers have higher rates of the stress related disorder\n\nPTSD is estimated to affect around one in every three people who have a traumatic experience, such as rape or a car crash.\n\nOverall, the condition is estimated to affect up to ten per cent of people, according to charities.\n\nSoldiers, police, fire brigade or ambulance workers face a greater risk because they often have to deal with horrifying scenes.\n\nUniversity of Iceland researchers found a link between stress related disorders and risk of cardiovascular disease earlier this year.\n\nBut this is one of the first studies to draw data from a large group of people to assess the risk of life-threatening infections, published in the British Medical Journal.\n\nAcademics from the same university, as well as teams in the US, China and Sweden, used data from nearly 145,000 patients with PTSD or a stress-related disorder.\n\nStress-related disorders included acute stress reaction, which can occur immediately after a traumatic events and sometimes precedes PTSD.\n\nDr Huan Song and colleagues compared the participants with data taken from their unaffected siblings - a group of 180,000 people.\n\nWHAT IS PTSD? Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events. People with PTSD often suffer nightmares and flashbacks to the traumatic event and can experience insomnia and an inability to concentrate. Symptoms are often severe enough to have a serious impact on the person's day-to-day life, and can emerge straight after the traumatic event or years later. PTSD is thought to affect about one in every three people who have a traumatic experience, and was first documented in the First World War in soldiers with shell shock. People who are worried they have PTSD should visit their GP, who could recommend a course of psychotherapy or anti-depressants, the NHS say. PTSD may be described differently in some situations: Delayed-onset PTSD \u2013 if your symptoms emerge more than six months after experiencing trauma. Complex PTSD \u2013 if you experienced trauma at an early age or it lasted for a long time. Birth trauma \u2013 PTSD that develops after a traumatic experience of childbirth.

Participants were tracked for eight years, on average.\n\nInfections studied included sepsis, meningitis and endocarditis \u2013 an infection of the inner lining of the heart.\n\nSome 2.9 cases of life-threatening infections were diagnosed every 1,000 person years in patients with a stress-related disorder.\n\nThis figure was double the 1.3 in the general population and much higher than the 1.7 in their unaffected siblings.\n\nThe incidence of those with PTSD specifically was 2.9, compared to 1.2 in the general population and 1.6 in siblings.\n\nThose with any stress related disorder had an 89 per cent higher risk of endocarditis than the general population.\n\nThey also had a 70 and 61 per cent higher risk of meningitis and sepsis - which is not an infection, but the body's aggressive response to an infection.\n\nCompared with their siblings, they had a 63 per cent higher risk of meningitis, 57 per cent higher risk of endocarditis and 52 per cent higher risk of sepsis.\n\nThose with PTSD had up to a 95 per cent higher risk of a life-threatening condition than the population and their siblings.\n\nThe younger a patient was at diagnosis, the more likely they were to be to face such an infection.\n\nOther mental health problems, especially substance use disorders, further increases the risk, the researchers said.\n\nThe excess risks discovered remained even when factors such as income, family background and other physical conditions were accounted for.\n\nThe true nature of the relation between physical health and stress related disorders is not understood.\n\nOne possibility is that stress heightens the level of glucocorticoids, hormones which naturally suppress the immune system.\n\nThis could make stressed individuals more vulnerable to catching an infection.\n\nA more recent theory suggests stress causes a surge in inflammatory cytokines. An imbalance may result, exacerbating future infections.\n\nThe study, published in the journal ADD NAME OF JOURNAL HERE, is observational and cannot establish cause.\n\nThe researchers are unable to rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors, such as smoking, may have influenced their results.", "description": "Icelandic researchers found twice as many PTSD patients and others with stress-related disorders suffered potentially deadly bugs than the general population.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/12/20080726-0-image-a-4_1571831194771.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
