The sum was less than what was raised by competitors polling below Biden, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014 who raised $25.3 million and $19.1 million, respectively, in the same period.\n\nAlthough Biden\u2019s total was also less than the $21.5 million he raised in the second quarter, his campaign attempted to put a positive spin on the fundraising numbers. In a statement provided to the press announcing the fundraising haul, Biden\u2019s team claimed that \u201c98 percent of all donations were from grassroots donors\u201d and 56 percent of all contributors were new.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s fundraising totals put the campaign in a strong position as we enter the fall. The question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond,\u201d said Greg Schultz, the former vice president\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cOur campaign unequivocally does and builds on our strength each week.\u201d\n\nDespite the campaign\u2019s positive spin, the fundraising numbers underscore Biden\u2019s declining position in the 2020 contest. When the former vice president first announced his campaign in late April, he was seen as the frontrunner for the nomination, a fact confirmed by his domination in the polls and strong fundraising. Since that time, however, Biden\u2019s campaign has been battered by persistent gaffes and ethical questions surrounding his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China.\n\nAll of this has impacted the former vice president\u2019s standing with the Democrat electorate. A slew of recent polls has shown Biden either trailing or tied with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in the first three early voting states of New Hampshire, Iowa, and Nevada. Likewise, Biden has lost his advantage nationally, trailing Warren by as many as six percentage points in a recent survey conducted for the Economist.", "description": "Joe Biden's fundraising efforts dropped significantly in the third quarter amid mounting concerns over his viability as a candidate.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Biden-Iowa-Confused-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
