Thom Levy, Asbury Park Press\n\nRonnie Ortiz-Magro faces a felony kidnapping charge after members of the Los Angeles Police Department responded to a battery incident at a home he and girlfriend Jen Harley were staying at in the Hollywood Hills section of Los Angeles in the early morning hours of Friday.\n\nOrtiz-Magro made a $100,000 bail and was released Friday afternoon, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.\n\n\u201cThe reporting of the alleged incident relating to Ronnie Magro yesterday is based upon pure speculation and innuendo,\u201d said lawyer Scott E. Leemon to Us Weekly on Saturday, Oct. 5. \u201cWe are currently conducting our own investigation and will have no further comment until that has been concluded.\u201d\n\nOrtiz-Magro was taken into custody at 3:10 a.m., according to police records.\n\nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY - AUGUST 26: Ronnie Ortiz-Magro attends the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards at Prudential Center on August 26, 2019 in Newark, New Jersey.

That child was unharmed.\u201d\n\nThe couple have an 18-month daughter, Ariana Sky.\n\n'Jersey Shore': Ronnie Ortiz-Magro detained on 'domestic violence' charges by LAPD\n\nEnd of an era: JWoww and Roger's divorce finalized, how the couple got here\n\n'The Situation': Mike Sorrentino thanks fans for 'touching his heart'\n\nIt's not the first time Ortiz-Magro is in trouble with the law for alleged violent behavior. He got into a punch up Sept. 4 2009 on the Seaside Heights boardwalk for which he was charged with one count of third-degree assault. He was given pre-trial intervention and the charge was eventually dismissed.\n\nRonnie Ortiz-Magro and Jen Harley at the Headliner in Neptune on Aug. 24. (Photo: Chris Jordan)\n\nOrtiz-Magro and Harley have a history of domestic altercations and arrests. Harley allegedly threw an ashtray at Ortiz-Magro during a brush up at the Hustler Club in Las Vegas on Dec. 31. He was struck in the face and filed a battery report with the police. Charges were later dropped.\n\nThat incident followed one in June of 2018 where Ortiz-Magro was caught in a seat belt outside of a car driven by Harley with their child inside in Las Vegas. He was dragged and suffered a rash and a bruised face. Harley was arrested but the case was \u201cdenied due to insufficient evidence,\u201d said the Clark County district attorney at the time.\n\n\u201cTwo people can be good people but still be bad for each other and bring out the worst in each other. Learning to be alone and liking yourself plays a big part in how you treat others and how others treat you,\u201d said Roger Mathews, former husband of \u201cJersey Shore\u201d star Jenni \u201cJWoww\u201d Farley, to US Weekly on Friday. \u201cYou\u2019re never gonna like the person in the mirror if you look to someone else to define you \u2014 especially if that person resents you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all flawed as humans but time and self-growth can redeem almost any of us. If you want it, that is.\u201d\n\nFarley previously charged Mathews with domestic abuse, along with other indiscretions, on her web site on Jan .30. Police were called to their former Toms River home last December when Farley filed a restraining order against Mathews.\n\n\u201cYou are an abuser to the core, Roger Mathews,\u201d Farley said. \u201cIf this was not enough you have spit at me. You have pushed me. You have shoved me. You have aggressively thrown me to the ground. You have prevented me from closing doors to escape having you come at me. You have belittled and disparaged me. You have threatened me.\u201d\n\nFarley and Mathews' divorce was finalized on Aug. 29. Ortiz-Magro is due back in court on Nov. 1.\n\nChris Jordan, a Jersey Shore native, covers entertainment and features for the USA Today Network New Jersey.
