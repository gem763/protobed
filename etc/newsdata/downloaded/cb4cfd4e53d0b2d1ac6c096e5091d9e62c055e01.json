The material, made from a magnesium and aluminium-based mineral called spinel, is far tougher and lighter than bulletproof glass and can be modelled into different shapes (dome pictured)\n\nSome have compared the material to the transparent aluminium used to create the windows on the spaceships in the hit TV series Star Trek.\n\nBut the scientists claim it could also be used to create scratchproof lenses for cameras and smartphones whose screens that do not smash when dropped.\n\nBOEING DEVELOP STAR TREK-STYLE FORCE FIELD FOR VEHICLES A force field that can protect vehicles from the destructive blast waves thrown out by explosions has been development by aircraft manufacturer Boeing. The company has been granted a patent for a device that appears to work like the fictional shields seen in science fiction movies like Star Wars and Star Trek. The system works by using an 'arc generator' to rapidly heat the air in front of a shockwave creating a cloud of electrically charged gas. This, Boeing says, creates a buffer that can refract, deflect and absorb the energy contained within the shockwave. They say the device could be mounted on vehicles such as tanks and armoured personnel carriers, buildings, aircraft, ships and submarines.\n\nThey say the transparent armour could additionally find uses in military lasers and infrared equipment.\n\nThe material, which has taken more than ten years to develop, is created by pressing a nanopowder together while heating it to create a pure piece of spinel crystal.\n\nThis can then be modelled, in a similar way to traditional clay.\n\nDr Jas Sanghera, who led the research at the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, said the material performed far better than bulletproof glass, which works by creating layers of plastic and glass up to five inches thick that slow the passage of a bullet.\n\nHe said: 'If you replaced that with spinel, you'd reduce the weight by a factor of two or more.'\n\nThe crystal structure of glass means that once a crack forms on the surface, it passes all the way through, and as a result bulletproof glass can become impossible to see through.\n\nInstead, windows made from spinel would not suffer the same problem.\n\nDr Sanghera said: 'It's like navigating through the asteroid belt, you create a tortuous path.\n\n'If I have all these crystals packed together, the crack gets deflected at the hard crystals. You dissipate the crack energy.'\n\nThe material, which has taken more than ten years to develop, is created by pressing a nanopowder together while heating it to create a pure piece of spinel crystal. The researchers said spinel (above) can be used to replace bullet proof glass as it is tougher and lighter weight\n\nAlthough spinel occurs naturally, the researchers have found they can synthesis it artificially into a powder, like above, that can then be heated and pressed into a variety of shapes, like the optical disks shown above\n\nSpinel windows and lenses could also be used to protect sensitive equipment like this infrared military camera. It could also be used to create new watch faces and phones that are truly resistant to smashing\n\nHe added that spinal windows could help to protect satellites and spacecraft visiting harsh environments on other planets.\n\n'You could leave these out there for longer periods of time, go into environments that are harsher than what they're encountering now, and enable more capabilities.'\n\nHe added that it could also be used to create new watch faces and smartphones that are truly resistant to smashing.\n\nSpinel, which is also known as magnesium aluminate, can be found naturally occurring as a gemstone, such as the Black Prince's Ruby, which is a coloured piece of spinel.\n\nThe crystal structure of glass means that once a crack forms on the surface, it passes all the way through, and as a result bulletproof glass can become impossible to see through. Instead, windows made from spinel would not suffer the same problem. Spinel (above) is completely transparent to light, even to infrared light\n\nThe team behind the new material (shown above) have spent nearly a decade developing the techniques\n\nResearchers at the US Naval Research Laboratory have synthesised their own ultra-pure spinel powder which they can form into sheets of crystal using a process called 'sintering' in a hot press (pictured)\n\nHowever, researchers at the US Naval Research Laboratory have synthesised their own ultra-pure spinel powder which they can form into sheets of crystal using a process called 'sintering' in a hot press.\n\nThe material has also been found to be optically very pure and so it can be used to create lenses for sensitive infrared cameras and lasers.\n\nDr Sanghera said: 'Lasers can be thought of as a box comprised of optics. There's passive and there's active components: passive is just a protective window; active is where we change the colour of light coming out the other end.", "description": "Scientists at the US Navy Research Laboratory in Washington have developed a see-through armour from spinel, a mineral that contains aluminium and magnesium.", "authors": ["Richard Gray For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/30/17/282BC90300000578-0-image-a-2_1430411682412.jpg", "published_at": "2015-04-30"}
