He was charged with dealing in stolen property as an organizer.\n\nEvidence from an investigation showed that turtles were sold for up to $300 each and retailed as much as $10,000 in Asia. Occasionally, sellers traded turtles for marijuana instead of cash.\n\nBoesenberg was also charged with possessing more than 20 grams of cannabis and possessing a controlled substance, THC oil.\n\nClemons was charged with dealing in stolen property, and the sale and offer of wild turtle.\n\nThe undercover investigation began when the FWC received a tip in February 2018. It determined that more than 4,000 turtles were illegally poached and sold on the black market over a six-month period.\n\nThe variety of turtles poached included Florida box turtles, Eastern box turtles, striped mud turtles, Florida mud turtles, chicken turtles, Florida softshell turtles, Gulf Coast spiny softshell turtles, spotted turtles and diamondback terrapins, the FWC said.\n\nAfter a search warrant on Aug. 12, investigators found hundreds of turtles still in the poachers\u2019 possession with an estimated black market value of $200,000.\n\n\u201cOver 600 turtles were returned to the wild, two dozen were quarantined and released at a later date, and a handful were retained by a captive wildlife licensee since they were not native to the area,\u201d the release stated. \u201cNearly 300 of the freed turtles are now part of a long-term monitoring project by the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation.\u201d\n\nTogether, the suspects allegedly contributed to the illegal wildlife trade in the United States, which the International Fund for Animal Welfare estimates is worth $19 billion annually.\n\nThough Lee County was hardest hit by the turtle poachers, the suspects allegedly also worked with traffickers across the state and country.\n\n\u201cThis sinister and illegal trade threatens the future of many species of North American animals, and as one of the most threatened animal groups on the planet, turtles are at the forefront of our concern,\u201d said Craig Stanford, chairman of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature\u2019s Turtoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group in the release.", "description": "Oct. 19 (UPI) \u2014 The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced the arrest of two Fort Myers men suspected of involvement in a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
