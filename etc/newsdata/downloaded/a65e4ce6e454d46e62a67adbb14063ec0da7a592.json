I ask him, \u201cHow do you get all the goals you are getting, how do you work for the team, how do you impact in big games?\u201d\n\nRaheem Sterling is helping out his younger England team-mates (Picture: Visionhaus)\n\n\u2018He gives you the best advice possible. He\u2019ll tell me to keep working hard, he\u2019ll tell me how to get the goals, how to get the assists.\n\n\u2018For a person like that to help you, it\u2019s an amazing feeling. Obviously, he\u2019s in a different team so he doesn\u2019t have to do that. But he does because he wants everyone to do well.\n\n\u2018But a player like him, it\u2019s a massive thing to know he\u2019s in the national team and I can chat to him and say what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not good. It\u2019s an amazing feeling.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard backed Sterling as an ideal role model for Hudson-Odoi, saying last month: \u2018I don\u2019t like to talk about other club\u2019s players but Raheem Sterling is an incredible example of a player with great talent, whose work ethic added to that talent and improvement in a short period of time through absolute dedication, has seen him become a complete player, who we are all wowed by.\n\n\u2018He is a great model for Callum because Callum has those talents. I want him to be the absolute best because he has the potential to do that and some of it is about hard truths and I saw some hard truths in the game the other day \u2013 ways that he can improve.\n\n\u2018He needs to listen to them and he will.
