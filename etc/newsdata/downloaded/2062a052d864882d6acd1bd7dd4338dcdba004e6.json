The lawsuit accused the company of allowing users\u2019 identities to be collected and stored without consent or notice.\n\nThe 24-page opinion upheld a district court\u2019s decision to certify a class action against the social media giant.\n\nThat decision was the first time a federal appeals court has delved into privacy issues related to facial recognition technology, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\u201cThe development of a face template using facial-recognition technology without consent (as alleged in this case) invades an individual\u2019s private affairs and concrete interests,\u201d Judge Sandra Ikuta, a Bush appointee, wrote in the opinion for the court.\n\nMr. Narayanan, in his statement Tuesday, said the company does not sell its technology or allow users\u2019 facial recognition data to be shared with third parties.\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Times, but a spokesperson told The Hill the new facial recognition practice will comply with the FTC\u2019s new settlement in July.\n\nThe FTC charged the company with at least eight privacy violations, alleging the social media giant made false claims about allowing consumers to control their privacy information.\n\nFacebook agreed to the $5 billion penalty, which the FTC said was by far the largest privacy fine in history.\n\nThe company reported revenue of $55.8 billion in 2018.\n\nAt the time of the settlement, the FTC said it intended the fine not only to punish Facebook for its past practices, but to try to change the company\u2019s culture to become more sensitive to privacy.\n\nFacebook, in the settlement, agreed to provide clearer notice of how it uses facial recognition technology, and to \u201cobtain affirmative express user consent.\u201d The company also promised to do a better job with account security.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
