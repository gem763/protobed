Okay... I, Pete Buttigieg, politician, do henceforth and forthwith declare, most affirmatively and indubitably, unto the ages, that I do favor Medicare for All, as I do favor any measure that would help get all Americans covered.

It's a compromise,\" Buttigieg said then. \"In the UK, you've got national health care, that would be the true left wing position, the true right wing position is free for all, all corporate, and the compromise position is a single payer system where you have private doctors but a public payer.\"\n\n\"Buttigieg and Harris have both shifted their position on Medicare for All and proposed their own health care plans,\" tweeted former aide to President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIraq is not yet lost, but if we continue to ignore it, it soon will be Obama praises marathon runners Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei for 'remarkable examples of humanity's ability' Each of us has a role in preventing veteran suicide MORE and \"Pod Save America\" host Jon Favreau on Wednesday in response to Buttigieg's tweet. \"And there can be perfectly legitimate reasons for that.
