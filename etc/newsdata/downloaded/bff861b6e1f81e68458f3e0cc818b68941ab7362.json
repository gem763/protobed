(PHOTO: Getty Images)\n\nSINGAPORE \u2014 In the latest development in an ongoing case, a male undergraduate accused of taking upskirt and shower videos of his fellow students at a local university had his identity redacted by the State Courts on Tuesday (22 October).\n\nThis came after the 26-year-old man\u2019s lawyer applied for a gag order extension. The accused currently faces 24 counts of insulting a woman\u2019s modesty over offences allegedly committed between August 2017 and March 2019 while on the university campus.\n\nA total of 21 counts involve him allegedly placing his mobile phone above a shower cubicle door to film his victims, while three charges state that he filmed under the skirt of an unidentified woman in a university classroom. From his charge sheets, a total of four women were involved.\n\nIn his second court appearance since he was charged, the man\u2019s lawyer Josephus Tan said that the victims involved might be identified should the man\u2019s name be reported in the media. When he was first charged, the court only imposed a gag order that covered the victims.\n\nUnder a court-imposed gag order, no person or media outlet can publish any details that might lead to the identification of the crime victim. These details include their names, addresses and photographs. Gag orders are usually imposed by the court to protect the identities of victims in sexual cases or cases involving children. In certain cases, the gag order will be extended to the accused person if the victim can be identified through the naming of the accused.\n\nAccused, victims shared dormitory room\n\nIn response to Tan\u2019s application, a police prosecutor said that she would leave the decision to extend the gag order to the court.\n\nHowever, District Judge Adam Nakhoda said there was a need for the prosecution to assess whether there was a risk of the victims\u2019 identities being exposed.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, there is no need to extend the gag order to the accused\u2019s identity unless there is a relationship between him and the victim. If there is no fear of identification of the victim, I won\u2019t grant any such order. The prosecution needs information on whether there is genuine concern.\u201d he said.\n\nThe case was later stood down for the prosecution to deliberate whether the gag order should be extended to cover the accused\u2019s identity. When the case resumed, the prosecution accepted that a gag order should be extended to the man, as he had shared a dormitory with four of his victims when he committed the offences.\n\nThis led DJ Nakhoda to say that there should be no further publishing of the man\u2019s details. The man will return to court on 12 November.\n\nMore Singapore stories:\n\nPHOTOS: Volocopter air taxi's test flight at Marina Bay\n\nLive: Volocopter proof of concept flight", "description": "SINGAPORE \u2014 A male undergraduate accused of taking upskirt and shower videos of his fellow students had his identity redacted by the State Courts.", "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Editorial Team"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MtnIeLqFjHKa7VByHLbS9g--~B/aD0zOTQ2O3c9NTkxOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/1852dbf0-f4a7-11e9-bede-453a803050b2", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
