So, it is no surprise at all.\n\n\u201cThey caused France quite a few problems in that game, so we are under no illusions of what to expect up front,\u201d he said.\n\nEngland\u2019s own scrummaging capabilities could be improved by the possible return of prop Mako Vunipola.\n\nVunipola, who has 54 caps for England, has been out with a hamstring injury he picked up against Ireland on Aug. 25. Ellis Genge and Joe Marler have impressed in England\u2019s opening two victories at the Rugby World Cup in Vunipola\u2019s absence.\n\nIt means that Vunipola, who is among the world\u2019s best loosehead props on his day, has a battle on his hands to win back his starting place.\n\n\u201cHe needs to be the best version of himself,\u201d Hatley said.\n\n\u201cWe know what Mako is capable of, he is a 50-plus cap international, we know what he brings from a ball-carrying point of view, defensively the impact he has on the team, but Joe and Ellis have been going exceptionally well.\n\n\u201cThat is what we want. We want that competition within the team to create pressure, work harder and to do more,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat we produce on the weekend will be a product of what we do in the week, so Mako is going to have to work hard this week in training,\u201d he said.\n\nEngland face Argentina in Tokyo on Saturday.", "description": "Argentina's once-feared scrum may not be as strong as it once was but England, their next Rugby World Cup opponents, are not taking that part of their game lightly, especially because the Pumas are coached by former world-class hooker Mario Ledesma.", "authors": ["Jack Tarrant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435439336&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0CB", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
