Johnson maintains that the only alternative to an acceptable Brexit deal is crashing out with no deal at all on 31 October.\n\nAlso today: media editor Jim Waterson on Prince Harry, privacy and the media.", "description": "Boris Johnson used his first leader\u2019s speech at the Conservative party conference to set up a new phase of negotiations with the EU and an election confrontation with Jeremy Corbyn.
