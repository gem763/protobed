[that's] not a competitive market.\"\n\nThe industry fund boss joked that it is \"fantastic\" to see a former Liberal Treasurer embrace a \"government intervention view of the world\".\n\nMr Costello clarified that his vision is for a government-run \"safety net\" that is only available to consumers who have not opted to voluntarily join an alternative fund. The fund should provide a \"very basic investment with very low fees\" and accrued balances should be able to be transitioned to non-government funds.\n\n\u201cI know the the industry funds say \u2018shock horror\u2019, but this happens in other countries,\" Mr Costello said. \"The Canada Pension Plan is one of the most sophisticated investors in the world. It has a beautiful suite of assets and it does it on low costs.\"\n\nThe former politician, who is also chairman of Nine, publisher of The Australian Financial Review, refuted Mr Silk's notion that the current superannuation system operates on a basis of market competition, returning fire at the in-jest comments that he had abandoned a liberal viewpoint.\n\n\u201cNothing about this is a free market,\" Mr Costello said. \"The whole edifice works off compulsion and legislation.\u201d\n\nFuture Fund won't go retail\n\nMr Costello clarified the role he sees for the $147 billion sovereign wealth fund he leads, rejecting any suggestion that the Future Fund become a manager of superannuation assets, as some government ministers have been lobbying for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Future Fund is not a retail fund and doesn't aspire to be one,\" he said. \"It doesn't want to take retail contributions. But if the government wants a safety net, it could set up its own and call it whatever you like.\"\n\nGiven its investment performance, having delivered a healthy 5.8 per cent return in 2018 outperforming retail and industry funds, Mr Costello previously told the Financial Review that the Future Fund could be better utilised advising a government fund.\n\n\"The Future Fund could be of assistance to a public default fund in working out asset allocation or recommending managers or maybe even having a wholesale role,\" he said.\n\nAPRA 'muscling up at last'\n\nThough he would welcome competition from a government-owned fund, Mr Silk said overwhelmingly the current system is working as intended, pointing to what he said was a positive conclusion by the Productivity Commission in its three-year probe.\n\n\u201cOn an objective view the system is working well,\" Mr Silk said. \u201c85 per cent of people in default MySuper accounts are getting above-benchmark returns.\n\n\"It is working very well for most people. It\u2019s not working well for a significant minority of people. That\u2019s where the attention should be.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Silk welcomed moves by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to crack down on underperforming superannuation funds, following the warning from deputy chair, Helen Rowell, that APRA will not be afraid to use its beefed up powers against trustees.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a compulsory system, you shouldn't be in a system where there are poor funds,\" Mr Silk said. \"The regulator is muscling up at last and should be getting rid of poor funds.\u201d", "description": "AustralianSuper chief executive Ian Silk would not oppose the establishment of a government-owned superannuation fund, as long as it aided competition in the $2.8 trillion system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2071%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_15%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/780b86b6a8b79986548cd41544345d5852453faf", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
