REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\n(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) is planning to invest an additional $1 billion or more in WeWork, altering a warrant agreement struck before WeWork postponed its IPO plans, the Financial Times reported, citing people briefed on the matter.\n\nSoftBank initially planned to invest $1.5 billion in the U.S. office-sharing startup as part of a warrant agreement, giving WeWork the right to receive the money in April next year in exchange for Class A common stock.\n\nA new deal would reduce the price per share at which SoftBank acquires WeWork stock, giving it a larger stake in the unprofitable property group, FT said on Wednesday. The investment could unlock more financing options for WeWork, which is in talks for a $3 billion to $4 billion loan from a consortium of banks, FT added.\n\nWeWork declined to comment on the report. SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWeWork co-founder Adam Neumann resigned as CEO on Tuesday and gave up the majority of his voting control, after SoftBank - its biggest backer - and other shareholders turned on him over a drop in the U.S. office-sharing start-up\u2019s estimated valuation.\n\nSoftBank invested in WeWork parent We Company at a $47 billion valuation in January, but investor skepticism led to a potential IPO valuation of as low as $10 billion earlier this month, Reuters reported.\n\nWe Company has said it is evaluating the \u201coptimal timing\u201d for an IPO.", "description": "SoftBank Group Corp <9984.T> is planning to invest an additional $1 billion or more in WeWork, altering a warrant agreement struck before WeWork postponed its IPO plans, the Financial Times reported, citing people briefed on the matter.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433951956&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P00P", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
