Doug Collins, R-Ga., moved to adjourn the hearing. Collins forced a failed voice vote that caused even further delay.\n\nNadler later stated that Lewandowski\u2019s \u201cbehavior in this hearing room [had] been completely unacceptable,\u201d and threatened to hold him \u201cin contempt.\u201d\n\nCOMBATIVE LEWANDOWSKI FRUSTRATES DEMOCRATS, AS IMPEACHMENT-PROBE HEARING DESCENDS INTO DISARRAY\n\nIn his opening statement, Lewandowski railed against the Trump investigations.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear the investigation was populated by many Trump haters who had their own agenda \u2013 to try and take down a duly elected president of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for actual collusion or conspiracy, there was none. What there has been, however, is harassment of this president from the day he won the election.\u201d\n\nMacCallum pointed out that the report was what \u201cleft the door open for this political avenue for Democrats\u201d by not making a decision on obstruction.\n\n\u201cAnd, that left that door open and Attorney General Bill Barr was displeased by that. He felt that when you look at the report that you absolutely could have made a judgment on obstruction,\u201d she told Smith.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMacCallum said to also keep in mind that when Mueller completed his report, he said his investigation was \u201cnot impeded in any way\u201d and that there were \u201cno barriers that were put forward by the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s the door that was left open,\u201d she said. \u201cThese Democrats want to walk through it, largely for political reasons; I think it\u2019s pretty clear. And, they need to determine whether or not this is \u2026a dead horse they want to continue to beat.\u201d\n\nMacCallum concluded: \u201cFifty-nine percent of the American people say that they want to move on from this. There\u2019s an election next year, and a lot of people -- including Nancy Pelosi and Dick Durbin, to some extent -- think that they do not want to be labeled the \u2018Impeachment Party\u2019 when they head into that election.\u201d", "description": "House Judiciary Democrats' questioning of former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski Tuesday exposed their political motivations for the impeachment-probe hearing, said \u201cThe Story\u201d host Martha MacCallum.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S", "America'S Newsroom."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/18/694940094001_6087442689001_6087440561001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
