At its present average of $1.7 million per loan, the company will have to hire 66 more highly-qualified bankers to meet the $10 billion threshold.\n\n\"One of our biggest concerns as we continue to scale this process is that we will just run out of talent, run out of bankers,\" Mr Bayliss said.\n\n\"I don't know how deep is the underlying talent pool out there. But we've certainly had to interview far more bankers before we expected.\"\n\nJudo Bank co-founder Joseph Healy said he would combine unconventional hiring and investment in AI to overcome a potential talent shortage. Louie Douvis\n\nThe lender plans to tackle the potential hiring challenge from two angles: first, assembling a \"dad's army\" (a working title) of former bankers and second, automating aspects of its work with artificial intelligence.\n\nJudo Bank chief executive Joseph Healy said the former relied on a population of experienced ex-bankers in their late-40s and mid-60s, who would act as \"agents\" for the bank and receive commission-based pay.\n\nIt was an opportunity for disillusioned bankers to \"go back to banking that they grew up with,\" said the former NAB group executive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI aspect of the plan could seem like a departure from Judo Bank's pitch of returning to an older, relationship-based model of banking. But Mr Healy said the strategies were complementary.\n\nThe chief executive said SME banking, as distinct from lending to consumers or big corporations, could not be fully automated because of an \"information efficiency problem\".\n\nWhereas a lender could easily go online and check the credit history of individuals or large corporates, they could not do the same for small businesses.\n\nDrawing an analogy to operating an airplane, he said \"cruising at altitude\" may be ripe for automation but human judgement would remain necessary at key moments like take-off and landing.\n\nIf Judo Bank could thread the needle on challenging and benefiting from the automation of banking, it could stand to gain from ongoing disruptions in the sector.\n\n\"If we're the only bank doing true judgement-based lending, then by definition, we're the only bank with the data on judgement-based lending and, therefore, any hope of teaching a machine,\" Mr Bayliss said.", "description": "The SME lender's discovery that 55 per cent of high-performing bankers failed a credit exam has led them to unconventional solutions to the potential hiring problem.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3077%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_26/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6507c7757ecab3202cd4155d70b03d283217676e", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
