Turkey has planes. It is capable of doing air strikes, and the military here doesn\u2019t have this capability. So it makes sense, they had to make an ally,\u201d says Robin Fleming, researcher at the Rojava Information Centre, who is based in Qamishli, 300 kilometres to the east.\n\nBut it remains an uneasy alliance. Syria\u2019s Kurds did not call for regime change in the early days of the civil war, and were often accused of compromising with Assad in return for autonomy in northern Syria. Now they have that autonomy, the Kurds appear to have given it away.\n\nRead more: Turkish footballers repeat military salutes in France match despite UEFA probe\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s mixed feelings about it. We haven\u2019t seen that it has changed a lot on the ground. Mostly it is just that the Syrian army and the SDF are fighting together, especially in Manbij, but all of the social and administrative institutions are in the hands of the autonomous administration.\u201d\n\nThere are also Syrians fighting on the other side of the conflict, with the Free Syrian Army, which fought the Assad government in the early days of the Syrian civil war before being eclipsed by militant jihadi groups such as the al-Nusra Front and IS, backing the Turkish invasion.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has pledged to rid northern Syria of Kurdish militias such as the Peoples Protection Units (YPG), which have links to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), the group that has waged a four decade conflict against the Turkish state.\n\nTurkey\u2019s invasion has provoked international outcry, from France and the UK as well as from U.S. president Donald Trump, who has called for a ceasefire and suggested that a trade deal between Ankara and Washington could be derailed unless the Turkish invasion is halted.\n\nBut for many Turks, an offensive in northern Syria and promises by Erdo\u011fan to resettle 3.6 million Syrian refugees in the so-called safe zone, is welcome.\n\n\u201cIt has cost them a lot and it will cost them even more now, with the sanctions,\u201d said Dareen Khalifa, at the think tank and NGO International Crisis Group. \u201cThey need a political win here and they need a military victory. I think what people are missing is that this is a very popular war in Turkey.\u201d\n\nIt may also be the final act of the war in Syria, said Julien Barnes-Dacey, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that this is a pathway towards an end game in Syria [and] it is the regime that will be the biggest beneficiary,\u201d he said. \u201cThe regime has moved up into the border areas, Turkey has carved out a narrow zone for itself, but effectively Damascus is looking stronger than ever.\u201d", "description": "Abandoned by their U.S. allies, the Syrian Democratic Forces are fighting alongside the Syrian army in Manjib.", "authors": ["Orlando Crowcroft"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/40/32/1000x563_cmsv2_ae8955b1-b8f9-57e1-8360-64d55a9825bf-4234032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
