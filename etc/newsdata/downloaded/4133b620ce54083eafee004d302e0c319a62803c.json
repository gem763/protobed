At the same time there were six prime ministerships and nine changes of leader in the Liberal and Labor Parties \u2013 slightly less than one a year. Small wonder the BBC crowned Australia \u201cthe coup capital of the democratic world.\u201d\n\nReflecting how aberrant this period has been, in the post-war period there have been three prime ministers who won four or more elections in a row \u2013 Liberal John Howard, Labor\u2019s Bob Hawke, and Liberal Party founder Sir Robert Menzies, who won seven in a row. Howard served in office for 11\u00bd years, Hawke for 8\u00bd years and Menzies for a record 17 years.\n\nLet\u2019s hope our current crop of politicians improve their performance, and then some, in the coming decade. They will need to because there are dark clouds wherever you look \u2013 from the US-China trade war to Brexit to the bizarre Donald Trump presidency. The latter has \u201can almost preternatural ability to make any foreign policy worse\u201d, commented the Financial Times\u2019 Charles Gardner following Trump-triggered mayhem in northern Syria, although the US secured a ceasefire in the region by the end of the week.\n\nThreat of impeachment\n\nThen there is the mother of all political campaigns preceding the November 2020 US presidential election. A near Melbourne Cup field of Democratic candidates is vying for the nomination to take on President Trump, who is himself facing a threat of impeachment. It\u2019s a drawn-out process that is avowedly legal but is in fact intensely political.\n\nIt starts off in the Democratic Party-controlled US House of Representatives. Assuming Trump is in fact impeached by the lower house for what the US Constitution calls \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanours\u201d, it will end in a post-impeachment trial in the Republican Party-controlled Senate. There a two-thirds majority vote is required to confirm any lower house impeachment decision.\n\nMeanwhile, a climate of political crisis is de rigueur in Trump\u2019s America. This has in turn influenced a global mood of trepidation undermining what British economist John Maynard Keynes referred to as \u201danimal spirits\u201d, or the sort of energetic optimism that powers economic expansion.\n\nExacerbating this negative vibe is the spectre of global economic stagnation. This has a number of possible causes, including the longer-term ageing process and lack of population growth in China and Europe. \u201cDemography is destiny,\u201d as former treasurer (and now chairman of Nine Entertainment, which publishes this newspaper) Peter Costello once pointed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, there are other influences. According to the latest IMF global economic outlook, the US-China trade war will reduce world economic growth to 3 per cent this year \u2013 the lowest rate since the GFC hit in 2008. This could worsen if trade tensions between the superpowers continue, the IMF says, and it has scaled back Australia\u2019s growth rate for this year to a paltry 1.7 per cent.\n\nBacking the latest IMF global economic prognosis, research jointly sponsored by the Democratic Party-leaning, Washington-based, Brookings Institution and the Financial Times says the world has entered a period of \u201csynchronised stagnation\u201d. Paradoxically, this comes two years after forecasts that the world was embarking on a period of \u201csynchronised growth\u201d after Trump-mandated tax cuts in the US.\n\nThose Trump tax cuts may have turned out to be more of a sugar hit, although current unemployment rates in countries like the US (3.7 per cent) and even Australia (5.2 per cent) remain healthy. But Costello\u2019s \u201cdemography-destiny\" paradigm has an important role.\n\nMediocre figures\n\nIn two reports published this year and in 2018, the IMF warned that future \u201cdemographic developments will continue to apply downward pressure on the interest rates in Asia which foresees a rapid ageing\u201d. Further, a low birth rate and population decline in large parts of Europe \u201cwill have significant implications for growth, living standards and fiscal sustainability\u201d, according to the IMF.\n\nConfirming its reputation as the dismal science, there are differing views among economists about whether the current mix of mediocre figures and forecasts will translate into a global recession, or otherwise. But policy makers are struggling to find a way to jump-start growth amid the constraints of high debt levels and record low interest rates, not to mention lower confidence.\n\nFor example, local economic policy settings continue to be cautious. The Scott Morrison-led Coalition government argues it must fulfil its promise to return the budget to surplus in the 2019-20 financial year as insurance against a declining global scene.\n\n\"Surpluses are not ends in themselves,\u201d Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told the Financial Review\u2019s Phillip Coorey before he jetted off to Washington to attend an IMF meeting. \u201cThey're not trophies on a cabinet table. They're actually an indication of strong budget management, and helping to build the resilience in the Australian economy so you can weather those economic shocks.''\n\nIt\u2019s more than a fair bet that the Coalition\u2019s assumptions behind its fiscal restraint will be sorely tested in coming years.", "description": "After almost ten years of self-inflicted angst over climate policy, real economic pressures are starting to pile up again.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8856%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_125/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6f190ab2b63947d3b3a97005632890e781079737", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
