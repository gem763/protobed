The [deputy] position was proposed in the year before the appointment of Mr Lockwood. Funding was considered when the decision to recruit was taken and found within the overall staff budget.\u2019\n\nHe added questions about Mr Whiting\u2019s qualifications related to a need to have a financially-qualified board member, despite Mr Lockwood fulfilling the criterion.\n\nMr Lockwood also declared he knew the PA candidate. \u2018It was a personal decision to hire her, but it was done through a process,\u2019 he said.\n\nEarlier this month, retired High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques said he was \u2018alarmed by the lack of knowledge of relevant criminal procedure\u2019 of those within the IOPC, lamenting the fact that an \u2018error-ridden\u2019 criminal inquiry was \u2018followed by such a lamentably slow and inadequate process\u2019.\n\nThe IOPC\u2019s lead investigator, who was in her 20s and had only a few years\u2019 experience, has since been moved to an administrative role.\n\nAnother worker was made lead investigator just months after leaving a job at Topshop.\n\nA Harrow Council spokesman said they could not comment on the exits of Mr Lockwood and Mr Whiting.", "description": "Michael Lockwood, director general of the Independent Office for Police Conduct, was on a panel which approved the appointment of Tom Whiting, his former number two at a local council.", "authors": ["Glen Keogh", "Neil Sears", "Stephen Wright For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/22/20198560-0-image-a-32_1572037827404.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
