Then they gave it to Louis van Gaal who is one of the world's great managers. Then they gave it to Jose Mourinho who has won everything there is to win. They couldn't turn it around. And now Ole is struggling with it.\n\n\"I think Ole has an impossible job. As I said, Van Gaal had it, Mourinho had it, Moyes had it. They are all top managers. None of them could turn it around.\n\n\"People say 'go and get five or six players'. But where are they going to get them from? Where are they? Who are they playing for? Are they going to move to Man United?\n\n\"You're not going to get Harry Kane. They're not going to go and get Raheem Sterling. Where are they going to find them from? Easy to say they need them but where are they going to find them?\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"It's easier said than done to build a new team. It's a very long-term job they have on their hands.\"\n\nSolskjaer, who sanctioned the departures of Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku in the close season, is trying to rebuild the side with a greater emphasis on youth.\n\nAs such, the club signed centre back Harry Maguire, right back Aaron Wan-Bissaka and winger Daniel James before the season started.\n\nBut it is one of the more experienced players - namely Paul Pogba - who Redknapp believes has been a huge disappointment this season.\n\n(Image: McDonald's)\n\n(Image: McDonald's)\n\n\"I don't know what he has done at United really? If he leaves United, he's not exactly going to leave there thinking 'what an amazing job I've done at United',\" he added.\n\nTo be fair, he's gone there after they let him go for nothing when he was a young player. He's gone back there and listen, I know he's a good player. He's won the World Cup with France.\n\n\"But, he's not going to be up there when you're picking your best Manchester United teams. He's not going to get anywhere near those teams is he?\"\n\nHarry Redknapp was speaking at a McDonald\u2019s Fun Football Session where he helped deliver the 2,000,000th hour of the Fun Football programme.
