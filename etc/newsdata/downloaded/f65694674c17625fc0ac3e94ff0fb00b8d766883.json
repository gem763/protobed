Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAfter a flawless first set from Mertens the tide turned in Andreescu\u2019s favour in the second when she fired a cross-court forehand winner to break the Belgian at love and take a 4-2 lead.\n\nShe fired another winner, her 40th, up the line to seal the win on a hot and humid night under the lights at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\n\u201cThis is honestly so crazy,\u201d an emotional Andreescu said in an on-court interview. \u201cA year ago I was in the qualifying round, I remember I was suffering from a back injury.\n\n\u201cNow what I\u2019ve accomplished this year, I\u2019m honestly speechless,\u201d said Andreescu, who will make her top 10 debut on Monday after ending last year ranked 178th.\n\n\u201cI need someone to pinch me right now. Is this real life?\u201d\n\nAndreescu will next face fellow first-time semi-finalist Belinda Bencic on Thursday after the Swiss advanced in straight sets earlier in the day.\n\nThe two have never played each other before.\n\nThe quarter-final offered a fascinating contrast in styles between the explosive power of the Canadian teenager and the steady counterpunching of the 23-year-old Mertens.\n\nBut once the 15th-seeded Andreescu found the range with her punishing groundstrokes, she was able to wear down the 25th-seed and pile up the winners.\n\n\u201cShe can do well in the big moments,\u201d Mertens said. \u201cShe gets that one more strike. She\u2019s a very powerful hitter but also a good mover.\u201d\n\nThe victory continues a strong-run for the 19-year-old, who clinched titles at Indian Wells in March and last month\u2019s Canadian Open.\n\nMENTAL EDGE\n\nAndreescu uses meditation and visualization to keep her mind sharp and said the techniques she learned as a child help her deal with the pressure of the moment.\n\n\u201cI think if you can control your mind, then you can control a lot of things,\u201d she told reporters.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s been working really well for me. I just kept doing that. When I\u2019m on the court in front of these big stages, I\u2019m really good at just blocking everything and staying in the zone.\u201d\n\nAnd in a warning sign for her competition, Andreescu said she still has room to improve at the tournament.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be honest. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve played my best tennis,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI just fought really well with what I had every single day. I think that\u2019s the most important thing for me, and I\u2019m sure for every athlete you\u2019re not going to have good days every day.\n\n\u201cSo I just try my best to figure out what\u2019s going well and what\u2019s not and just go from there.\u201d", "description": "Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu came from behind to overpower Elise Mertens 3-6 6-2 6-3 and reach her first Grand Slam semi-final at the U.S. Open on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Rory Carroll", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426388594&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8406Q"}
