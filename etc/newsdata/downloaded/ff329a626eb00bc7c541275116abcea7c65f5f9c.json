It\u2019s worked repeatedly for Trump, from fighting the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of racial discrimination at his family\u2019s rental properties in the 1970s to overcoming Bob Mueller\u2019s investigation the past two years. Among other things, this strategy involves denying everything and counterattacking critics by accusing them of whatever you\u2019ve been accused of.\n\nThe don\u2019t-give-an-inch mentality is what prompts someone like White House policy adviser Stephen Miller to declare on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that \u201cthe president of the United States is the whistleblower, and this individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government.\u201d And it is why Trump allows Rudy Giuliani, his ferocious personal attorney, to keep defending him on television despite the messes he seems to make each time he goes on the air.\n\n-- Bossert\u2019s appearance Sunday morning on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d showed that even Trump loyalists cannot always be counted on to espouse Trump\u2019s I-know-what-you-are-but-what-am-I talking points. The former homeland security adviser strongly criticized the president for furthering the unfounded conspiracy theory that the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike played a role in shielding the Democratic National Committee\u2019s server and perhaps the true origins of the hackers. Bossert noted that the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that the Russians hacked the Democratic servers.\n\n\u201cThat conspiracy theory has got to go,\u201d Bossert said, explaining that Trump is motivated to spread the \u201ccompletely debunked\u201d theory because he had \u201cnot gotten his pound of flesh yet\u201d over being \u201cwrongly accused of colluding with Russia\u201d to win the 2016 election. But Bossert warned that he risks taking it too far: \u201cIf he continues to focus on that white whale, it\u2019s going to bring him down,\u201d he said.\n\nBossert resigned as the top homeland security official in the White House in April 2018 at the request of John Bolton, one day after Bolton took over as national security adviser. On ABC, where he has a contributor contract, Bossert also criticized Giuliani for pushing conspiracy theories on the president because \u201cit sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again.\u201d\n\nBossert\u2019s comments were measured. He said he\u2019s not convinced that Trump leveraged U.S. aid to Ukraine for political dirt, noting that there might have been legitimate reasons to hold back the money, such as getting other European countries to put up more. \u201cThat said,\u201d Bossert added, \u201cit is a bad day and a bad week for this president and this country if he is asking for political dirt on an opponent.\u201d\n\nAppearing later in the program, Giuliani told anchor George Stephanopoulos: \u201cTom Bossert doesn't know what he's talking about.\u201d\n\n-- Kinzinger\u2019s tweet on Sunday night suggested that there\u2019s some limit to how much congressional Republicans will defend Trump\u2019s tactics. The president vigorously defended himself on Twitter all weekend and continued to attack the whistleblower whose complaint set in motion the impeachment inquiry. At one point, the president highlighted a quote he apparently heard on Fox News from an evangelical pastor who supports him.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal,\u201d Trump tweeted, adding his own parenthetical to a comment from Robert Jeffress, a Southern Baptist preacher who is based in Dallas.\n\nKinzinger, a decorated Air Force veteran who served as a pilot in Iraq and Afghanistan and represents the Chicago suburbs in Congress, quickly replied: \u201cI have visited nations ravaged by civil war,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President.\u201d\n\nTHE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATION:\n\n-- Nancy Pelosi, mindful of her front-line moderates, is counting on House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff to keep the impeachment inquiry focused on Ukraine. She thought the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s hearing with Corey Lewandowski the week before last was a debacle for Democrats. By coincidence, that embarrassing fiasco came just days before the deluge of revelations about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine\u2019s president. Those two events prompted the speaker to change up strategy. For now, she\u2019s largely sidelined Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler to elevate Schiff. Pelosi wants the investigation to focus narrowly on Ukraine and believes it\u2019s easier for the public to understand than what was covered in the Mueller report. (Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis have more on the internal machinations.)\n\n-- \u201cOn a conference call with House Democrats on Sunday afternoon, Pelosi told her colleagues that public sentiment \u2014 something she had frequently cited as an obstacle to pursuing impeachment \u2014 had begun to swing around,\u201d per Felicia Sonmez and DeBonis. \u201c\u2018The polls have changed drastically about this,\u2019 she said, urging a careful approach, according to notes taken by a person on the call: \u2018Our tone must be prayerful, respectful, solemn, worthy of the Constitution.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Here\u2019s the jurisdictional breakdown by committee: Intelligence will focus on allegations that Trump coerced Ukraine to dig up dirt on his political opponent. Foreign Affairs will focus on any wrongdoing by Trump appointees within the State Department, especially pertaining to Giuliani. Oversight will scrutinize why the summary of the Ukrainian call was moved to a more classified system, which the whistleblower alleged was done in an effort to keep the misconduct from getting out. Judiciary would retake center stage when it comes to drafting articles of impeachment.\n\n-- Schiff said his panel has reached a tentative agreement to secure testimony from the still-anonymous whistleblower \u201cvery soon,\u201d pending a security clearance from acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower,\u201d Schiff said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nMark Zaid, a lawyer for the whistleblower, said no date or time for the testimony has been set. He said bipartisan negotiations in both chambers are ongoing, and \u201cprotecting the whistleblower\u2019s identity is paramount.\u201d Andrew Bakaj, another attorney for the whistleblower, sent a letter to Maguire expressing fears for his client\u2019s safety.\n\nAfter CBS News reported last night at the top of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that the whistleblower is \u201cunder federal protection,\u201d citing that letter, Zaid replied that the network \u201ccompletely misinterpreted contents of our letter.\u201d CBS responded that it \u201cstands by its sources and reporting.\u201d\n\n-- Coming attractions: On Wednesday, House investigators from the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees are scheduled to depose Marie Yovanovitch, a career foreign service officer who was recalled early from her post as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. On Thursday, the investigators will depose Kurt Volker, who resigned on Friday night as Trump\u2019s special State Department envoy to Ukraine and who Giuliani was in contact with. On Friday, intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson \u2013 another Trump appointee \u2013 is scheduled to testify behind closed doors about his determination that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was urgent and credible.\n\n-- Subpoenas were issued late Friday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, giving him a week to turn over documents.\n\n-- Giuliani said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that Pompeo told him he was aware of his shadow diplomacy to prod Ukraine's government to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his family. \u201cI did not do this on my own,\u201d he said. \u201cI did it at the request of the State Department, and I have all of the text messages to prove it. And I also have a thank you from them from doing a good job. \u2026 When I talked to the secretary last week, he said he was aware of it.\u201d\n\n-- Giuliani was not the only attorney linked to Trump trying to get damaging information on Biden from Ukraine, Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace reported on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: \u201cJoe DiGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, worked alongside the former New York City mayor. According to a top U.S. official, the three attorneys were working \u2018off the books\u2019 \u2013 not within the Trump administration \u2013 and only the president knows the details of their work. DiGenova and Toensing have been staunch supporters of Trump and were close to joining his legal team during Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. That ultimately did not happen due to conflicts, as Toensing had previously represented witnesses who had already spoken to Mueller\u2019s team. In a tweet on Sunday, Toensing denied that her husband and she were working with Giuliani and called the reporting \u2018categorically false.\u2019 Wallace later responded, \u2018We stand by our story.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Fox News also reported that Trump\u2019s order to withhold assistance for Ukraine was made despite \u201cunanimous\u201d support for delivering the aid from the Pentagon, the State Department and the National Security Council.\n\n-- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has not suffered politically back home for kowtowing to the American president\u2019s demands -- at least not yet. Will Englund and Natalie Gryvnyak track the fallout in Kiev: \u201cIt might not say much for his adherence to the rule of law that he appeared amenable to [Trump\u2019s] suggestion, analysts say. But in Ukraine, it\u2019s hardly shocking. And, importantly, he hasn\u2019t actually done anything about it since he hung up the phone. \u2018This scandal is not affecting Ukrainian politics at all,\u2019 said Sviatoslav Yurash, a Zelensky ally in the Rada, or parliament. \u2018American politics isn\u2019t on top of the agenda.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut some members of the Rada appear ready to turn up the heat. Prominent among them is Oleksiy Honcharenko, a member of former president Petro Poroshenko\u2019s party. Honcharenko told The Washington Post on Sunday that \u2018sources\u2019 within the government have told him Ukraine has both a transcript and an audio recording of the call \u2014 and he plans to ask Zelensky to release them. The chances of that happening are slim, which raises the possibility that Honcharenko is merely trolling. He said he plans to hold an informal hearing later this week. \u2018He\u2019s doing a stunt,\u2019 Yurash said. \u2018Some people like that.\u2019\u201d\n\nTHE POLITICS:\n\n-- An ABC News-Ipsos poll released Sunday shows that just about half of Americans said they are \u201cnot surprised at all\u201d to hear of Trump\u2019s actions. An additional 32 percent said they are \u201cnot surprised,\u201d Scott Clement and Colby Itkowitz report. \u201cThe national poll, conducted Friday and Saturday, also finds that 63 percent of adults say it is a serious problem that Trump pushed the president of Ukraine to investigate the son of his potential 2020 opponent \u2026 Less than half of the public, 43 percent, said Trump\u2019s action was \u2018very serious.\u2019 The survey did not ask whether Trump should be impeached or about accusations that White House officials tried to keep the July phone call secret\u2026\u201d\n\n-- A CBS-YouGov survey, also released Sunday, found that 55 percent of Americans support an impeachment investigation, though independents remain evenly divided. The poll showed that only 42 percent said Trump deserves to actually be impeached, with 22 percent saying it\u2019s too soon to know.\n\n-- That topline number tracks with what Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee officials say their internal polling shows. In the conference call yesterday afternoon with Pelosi, DCCC chair Cheri Bustos told members that their private poll \u2013 in the field on Thursday and Friday \u2013 showed that 54 percent of likely voters support Democrats opening an impeachment inquiry, and that voters preferred a pro-impeachment Democrat over an anti-impeachment Republican by 11 points. But Politico reports that Bustos urged anyone who might be vulnerable to gauge local support and test messages through polling in their own districts \u2014 and promised the party committee will help pay for these surveys.\n\n-- \u201cDemocratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries outlined a plan to message the issue with \u2018repetition,\u2019\u201d Politico adds. \u201cHe named six words that Democrats will use \u2014 \u2018betrayal, abuse of power, national security\u2019 \u2026 On the call, Pelosi reiterated that Democrats would remain focused on their legislative agenda and said she hopes Trump doesn't walk away from a deal on trade or drug pricing \u2014 a dual approach that many moderates have said is key to keeping the House.\u201d\n\n-- The House is on a two-week recess, which means members are back in their districts. Vulnerable Democrats appear to be treading carefully as they arrive home. From the New York Times: \u201cOrange County was the epicenter of the 2018 House Democratic takeover, where Republicans lost four seats \u2026 On Saturday night, as three of the victorious Democrats were honored at an annual political dinner, a new battle was on everyone\u2019s minds: How to protect those gains in 2020 by selling voters on the impeachment inquiry \u2026 At the dinner, Representative Harley Rouda warned Democrats not to \u2018sit on our laurels.\u2019 Representative Mike Levin solemnly said \u2018the times have found us.\u2019 And Representative Gil Cisneros, who came out for the inquiry only last week, plugged his campaign website twice to ask for donations and noted, \u2018The Republicans are coming after me now.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat Democratic messaging challenge came into sharp relief during interviews with voters like Donna Artukovic, a retired teacher who was volunteering at the Orange County dinner. Ms. Artukovic expressed nervousness about what an impeachment battle could mean for Democratic candidates. \u2018I am afraid it\u2019s going to hurt them,\u2019 she said. \u2018A lot of people \u2014 even who don\u2019t like Trump \u2014 don\u2019t like impeachment.\u2019\n\n\u201cRepresentative Andy Kim of New Jersey, a Democrat who ousted a Republican incumbent in 2018 by focusing on issues like health insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions, held a town hall-style meeting in his district on Saturday where only one voter asked about impeachment (and even then, it was part of a multipronged question). In an interview afterward, Mr. Kim noted the paucity of questions on a topic that has engulfed Washington.\"\n\nJoe and Hunter attend a Duke-Georgetown NCAA college basketball game in 2010. (Nick Wass/AP)\n\n-- The presidential campaign has entered uncertain territory, and campaigns are still figuring out how they should try to adjust messaging and scheduling, Sean Sullivan reports.\n\n-- Some of Biden\u2019s supporters are voicing growing concern that his campaign is not prepared to weather the dual political rip currents suddenly reshaping the 2020 race \u2014 an onslaught of attacks on his family from Trump and a tightened contest for the Democratic nomination. Matt Viser reports: \u201cSeveral allies, including top financial backers, are weighing whether to create a super PAC to independently defend Biden and go after the president, who has repeatedly accused the former vice president of corruption and whose campaign last week launched a $10 million ad blitz aimed largely at attacking Biden. \u2026\n\n\u201cBiden, who has insisted his election would return the country to normalcy, has over the past several days largely sought to avoid the political spasm in which he is now a central figure. His campaign has sent out daily statements on health care and other issues, as if leaning toward predictability in a highly unpredictable time. He has only sporadically talked about Trump\u2019s attacks on him and his son Hunter. At a fundraiser Saturday in Park City, Utah, the host, Barry Baker, called Trump a \u2018lying, narcissistic traitor, cheater,\u2019 while Biden over the course of a 20-minute speech did not mention impeachment or the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. \u2026\n\n\u201cOn Sunday, two top Biden campaign officials sent a letter to the heads of major news and cable networks, urging them not to book [Giuliani]. \u2018By giving [him] your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation,\u2019 the letter from Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield reads.\u201d\n\n-- The White House is preparing to activate an impeachment-focused war room: \u201cActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House counsel Pat Cipollone will be among those who present the president with the plan for a rapid-response effort that could come as early as Monday,\u201d NBC News reports. \u201cIt was unclear who would lead the internal effort, but one person expected to play a role was White House spokesman Steven Groves, who has spent time in both the White House counsel\u2019s office helping manage the Mueller inquiry and the press shop as a spokesman on issues related to congressional investigations \u2026 \u2018We\u2019re not going to get caught flat-footed, and we\u2019re not going to take it lying down,\u2019 said one source.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia denied ordering the murder of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi, despite a CIA assessment that found he probably authorized it. But, in an interview that aired last night on CBS's \"60 Minutes,\" MBS said he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d because Khashoggi's death was committed by Saudi government employees. \"If there is any such information that charges me, I hope it is brought forward publicly,\" he told Norah O\u2019Donnell. \"Mohammed appeared to deny that any of his confidants were involved in the plot to kill Khashoggi ... in comments that appeared to contradict the assertions made by Saudi prosecutors,\" Kareem Fahim reports. \"The crown prince also played down the kingdom\u2019s notoriously harsh suppression of free speech. \u2018There is no threat from any journalist,\u2019 the crown prince said, speaking of Khashoggi. \u2018The threat to Saudi Arabia is from such actions against a Saudi journalist.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- To mark the first anniversary of Khashoggi\u2019s death on Wednesday, The Post\u2019s Global Opinions section collected a number of essays on the journalist's legacy and the quests that animated his life.\n\n-- Yemen's Houthi rebels claim to have killed or wounded 500 Saudi-led coalition fighters and captured 2,000 in a major assault near the border between the two nations. They released footage they said shows hundreds of captured troops and destroyed Saudi vehicles. Sudarsan Raghavan reports: \u201cThe Saudi-led coalition has yet to respond to the rebels\u2019 claims. If confirmed, the assault would be one of the most significant victories for the Iranian-aligned rebels \u2026 in the nearly five-year civil war gripping the Middle East\u2019s poorest nation. The Houthi-owned Al-Masirah television network broadcast footage showing a long, snaking line of what the rebels said were captured troops walking in rugged terrain. Many of the men, who apparently surrendered to the rebels, were dressed in flip flops and the traditional sarong-like clothing worn in Yemen and parts of Saudi Arabia. A handful wore tan camouflage uniforms. At least two said on camera that they were citizens of Saudi Arabia. Other images showed burning armored vehicles with Saudi markings and weapons that the Houthis said they seized. Houthi fighters are shown apparently launching attacks on coalition troops, clashes that left what appears to be corpses in Saudi military uniforms. [The Post] could not independently verify any of the images.\u201d\n\n-- Amid growing tensions with Iran, the U.S. Air Force shifted its Middle East command center from Qatar to South Carolina. Adam Taylor reports: \u201cFor 13 years, the United States has used a single building in [Al Udeid, Qatar] to command fighter jets, bombers, drones and other Air Force assets in a region that stretches from Northeast Africa through the Middle East to South Asia. And yet on Saturday \u2026 hundreds of seats at the Combined Air and Space Operations Center at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar sat empty. Instead, the air power of the United States and its allies was being controlled by teams at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina \u2014 more than 7,000 miles away. Though the move was only temporary \u2014 Al Udeid took back control on Sunday after 24 hours \u2014 it was a significant tactical shift. The unannounced operation, which [The Post] was invited to observe, was the first time U.S. command and control had been moved out of the region since the center was established in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.\u201d\n\n-- American officials are warning of a rising threat from an al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria. From the Times: \u201cThe rise of this latest Qaeda branch in Syria, as well as the operations of other Qaeda affiliates in West Africa, Somalia, Yemen and Afghanistan, underscore the terrorist group\u2019s enduring threat despite the death of Osama bin Laden and being largely eclipsed in recent years by the Islamic State, or ISIS, as the terrorist group of choice of global jihadis. The new Qaeda branch, called Hurras al-Din, emerged in early 2018 after several factions broke away from a larger affiliate in Syria. \u2026 Hurras al-Din is considered so dangerous that the Pentagon in at least one instance took the unusual step of using a special hotline with Russian commanders in Syria to allow the American military to conduct uncontested airstrikes against Qaeda leaders and training camps in Aleppo and Idlib provinces in June and August.\u201d\n\n-- Dismal turnout in Afghanistan\u2019s presidential election could weaken the country\u2019s next government. Susannah George and Pamela Constable report: \u201cWith just over half the votes counted, Afghanistan\u2019s Independent Election Commission estimated that only 2.2 million out of 9 million registered voters cast ballots in the election Saturday, the country\u2019s fourth. The last presidential election here was in 2014. \u2026 A combination of security concerns, fear of fraud and voting irregularities kept people away, election monitors said. The two front-runners were President Ashraf Ghani, who is a seeking a second term, and Abdullah Abdullah, the country\u2019s chief executive. Preliminary results aren\u2019t expected before Oct. 17; final results are due Nov. 7.\u201d\n\n-- Exit polls show Austria\u2019s Chancellor Sebastian Kurz may have survived a scandal that forced him to call snap elections. Loveday Morris reports: \u201cHis party has won 38 percent of the vote, according to preliminary results published by the Austria Press Agency, which excludes absentee ballots. That would be an increase of almost 6 percent since elections in 2017, although he will still need to form a coalition to govern. What remains unclear is whether he will team up again with the Freedom Party after a campaign that has focused more on personality politics than on policy. The country of 8.8 million has been run by a nonpartisan caretaker government since June. ... The Freedom Party\u2019s decline could make Kurz more likely to look elsewhere for a coalition, a move that would strike a symbolic blow to the far right in Europe.\u201d\n\n-- Several people were seriously injured in another anti-China demonstration in Hong Kong, including an Indonesian journalist hit in the eye by a projectile while live-streaming the event for her publication. Shibani Mahtani and Timothy McLaughlin report: \u201cDespite the forceful police response, the protesters persevered and scattered across central areas of the city. Some set fires, broke windows at subway stations and threw bricks at officers. Street battles broke between protesters and police who struggled to keep the demonstrators at bay with rubber bullets and tear gas. Residents and tourists were caught in the crossfire, clutching their faces and running in fear in several areas, including the neon-lit luxury shopping district of Causeway Bay. About 5 p.m., police launched an aggressive clearance operation against protesters occupying Harcourt Road, where clashes have broken out frequently during the past four months. Police pushed young demonstrators to the asphalt road and dragged them away, leaving pools of blood.\u201d\n\n-- Thousands rallied in Moscow to demand the release of protesters jailed during political demonstrations over the summer. From the Journal: \u201cThe protesters were arrested during demonstrations that began in July in objection to authorities\u2019 refusal to allow several prominent antigovernment candidates to be placed on the Sept. 8 Moscow City Council ballot. Swarms of police in riot gear broke up the demonstrations and more than 2,000 people were detained amid complaints of police brutality. Five people have been convicted and sentenced to prison on charges relating to the summer protests \u2026 Sunday\u2019s rally, organized by the Libertarian Party of Russia, was authorized by the Moscow mayor\u2019s office \u2026 It drew around 20,000 people, according to the press service of the Moscow department of the Russian Interior Ministry.\u201d\n\n-- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson denied any wrongdoing over allegations that an American businesswoman, Jennifer Arcuri, received money and perks from his London office when he was the city\u2019s mayor. From the BBC: \u201cMr Johnson said everything had been done \u2018with full propriety.\u2019 The allegations, first reported in the Sunday Times, claim Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor of London and that her company received several thousand pounds in sponsorship grants. The paper has also reported Ms Arcuri told four friends that she had an affair with Mr Johnson while he was mayor of London.\u201d\n\nLuz Bertila Zazueta, 75, of Tijuana, right, hugs farewell to a Peruvian woman and her four children whose numbers were called to claim asylum at a border crossing in San Diego. (Elliot Spagat/AP)\n\nDIVIDED AMERICA:\n\n-- A growing number of migrants are using riskier tactics to cross the U.S. border after being blocked by Trump\u2019s immigration policies. From the New York Times: \u201cThousands of Central American migrants \u2026 have been clustered in Mexican border cities like Matamoros for months, blocked from seeking asylum in the United States by a series of escalating restrictions. \u2026 While some have given up, taking free transportation provided by the American government and United Nations back to their homes in Central America, many others who are stuck in Matamoros said that desperation had led them to consider treacherous and potentially life-threatening border crossings \u2014 by charging across the river, climbing into hot and airless tractor-trailers driven by human smugglers, or both. \u2026 The number of migrants caught hiding in tractor-trailers along the border has gone up by 40 percent this year, according to the Border Patrol. \u2026 Agents have pulled more than 2,700 migrants so far this year out of tiny rooms in homes and hotels, known as stash houses, that are used by smugglers to hide people temporarily between legs of their journeys into the United States. Stash house raids have gone up 50 percent in Laredo this year.\u201d\n\n-- While Trump touts his border wall, Los Angeles will unveil a monument to migrants. From the Los Angeles Times: \u201cA bronze migrant worker holds el cortito, a short-handled hoe that required field workers to be bent over for their 10- to 12-hour shifts. To the left of the worker, his wife holds their son, clutching a toy Ford truck in one arm while stretching out the other arm in search of his father. To the right, there\u2019s a pile of workers\u2019 tools and other symbols depicting how migrants were exploited. The Bracero Monument, unveiled Sunday, was created by artist Dan Medina, 51, as part of a $3.2-million streetscape and pedestrian improvement project that also highlights Native American, African American and immigrant cultures from many L.A. communities. \u2026 \u2018These men left their families to go north and endure difficult working conditions for little pay to support their families,\u2019 L.A. City Councilman Jose Huizar said in a statement, adding that his father and uncles were part of the bracero program. \u2018It is important that we honor them, their hard work and their contributions to this country.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- The Los Angeles Police Department launched an investigation into how one of its recruitment ads landed on alt-right website Breitbart. Alex Horton reports: \u201cThe advertisement, noted first by Daily Beast Editor in Chief Noah Shachtman, triggered a backlash on social media. Seeking to distance itself from Breitbart entirely, the department said the advertisement was \u2018a negative juxtaposition to our core values.\u2019 \u2018The LAPD celebrates diversity and embraces it within our ranks, and within the city we serve,\u2019 the department said Saturday. The LAPD also said it has opened an inquiry into how the ad landed on the Breitbart page in the first place. The discovery was so bewildering to the department that Police Chief Michel Moore said on Twitter that the LAPD wondered whether the ad was a \u2018spoof\u2019 or an effort to discredit the department by linking it to the far-right operation.\u201d\n\n-- Houston police are building a case against the alleged killer of a trailblazing Sikh sheriff\u2019s deputy shot twice in the back of the head while returning to his patrol car. From USA Today: \u201cSandeep Dhaliwal [was] a 10-year member of the Harris County force who in 2015 was granted an accommodation to wear a turban and beard on patrol to honor his Sikh faith. \u2026 Dhaliwal, 42, was the first Sikh sheriff\u2019s deputy in Harris County, part of a Gulf Coast region where an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 people share his faith, according to the Houston Chronicle. His hiring in 2009 was regarded as a step toward improving relations with the Sikh community. \u2026 Authorities have given no indication that the killing was a hate crime.\u201d\n\n-- One year after the shooting at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, community members have struggled to do something constructive with their tragedy as they remain divided on whether politics should guide their reaction. From the Atlantic: \u201cIn the months since the shooting, not everyone in the Pittsburgh Jewish community has agreed on what it means to be \u2018stronger than hate,\u2019 much less on why the attack happened in the first place. Three different views, roughly, have emerged. Some people have called for the return of American civility, preaching that tolerance and dialogue can beat back the shooter\u2019s unfathomable bigotry. Others believe this shooting was part of the Jew hatred that reemerges in every generation, convinced that it might have taken place no matter the state of American politics. And then there are the Jews who have turned to activism, guided by the conviction that the right political solutions can prevent future injustices. This response to the shooting, more than any other, exposes the hopefulness, and fragility, of the American Jewish experience. Jews in the United States are safer than Jews have been anywhere at any point in history. That stability has nurtured a liberal theology that prizes tikkun olam\u2014a dedication to \u2018repairing the world\u2019\u2014above all else. But this deadly act of anti-Semitism is testing whether universal, progressive principles adequately address targeted violence against Jews. Politics can feel like a thin solution to evil.\u201d\n\n-- Members of the billionaire Sackler family, owners of Purdue Pharma, are profiting from the sale of ski resorts in regions plagued by the opioid crisis. Christopher Rowland reports: \u201cSome members of the billionaire Sackler family \u2026 will reap about $60 million in financial gains from the sale of 17 ski resorts in the Northeast and Midwest, according to financial disclosure filings. Many of the ski areas in the transaction sit in places that have been hit hard by prescription narcotic abuse over the past 20 years, including those in New Hampshire, as well as hills in Vermont, the Catskills in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. \u2026 Within the complex network of family business interests, the Sackler stake in the company that sold the ski areas, Peak Resorts Inc., represents just one strand. Court records indicate the wealth of Sackler family members who own Purdue is mostly tied up in private trusts and business entities domestically and overseas.\u201d\n\n-- A teen\u2019s private and intimate conversations with another boy were leaked by his classmates. Hours later, he killed himself, his family said. Allyson Chiu reports: \u201cChanning Smith\u2019s final Instagram post was a terse message to his followers. \u2018I\u2019m gonna get off social media for awhile,\u2019 the 16-year-old from Manchester, Tenn., wrote last week. \u2018I really hate how I can\u2019t trust anyone because those I did were so fake. Bye.\u2019 Hours later, Channing was dead, his older brother, Joshua Smith, wrote on Facebook. The teenager committed suicide after discovering that sexually explicit messages he exchanged with another boy had been shared on social media by classmates who wanted to \u2018humiliate and embarrass\u2019 him, Smith told WZTV. \u2026 Channing\u2019s death continues to send shock waves through his community with his family accusing the local district attorney, who has previously stated anti-LGBT views, of failing to seriously investigate the incident. The news even caught the attention of country music legend Billy Ray Cyrus, who made a trip to Manchester on Sunday to perform at a memorial for Channing.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren campaigns on Friday in Hollis, N.H. (Cheryl Senter/AP)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Elizabeth Warren, while surging in the national polls, continues to have major problems in South Carolina because of her failure to make inroads with black voters. From CNN: \"On the campus of a small historically black college this weekend [in Rock Hill] that was very much evident -- she only drew a handful of black voters in a crowd of about 1,000 people. Event attendance, particularly on a Saturday afternoon in 90 degree weather, is a very rough metric -- Biden's crowd at the same venue was mostly white as well. But it's clear that Warren, like Bernie Sanders before her, is struggling with black voters. She is all the rage on black twitter, not so much elsewhere. A new CNN poll has her lagging Biden in this state among black voters by 41 points -- she notches 4% among black voters. (Sanders gets 13%).\u201d\n\n-- Warren\u2019s campaign has made a science out of the rapid selfie, and it is quickly becoming a hallmark of her campaign. From the Boston Globe: \u201cFar from the existential despair and rage that one usually encounters among people who are waiting in a very long line, the people sticking around to meet Warren at Keene State were eager, rule-abiding, optimistic \u2014 matching almost perfectly the tone of the event.\"\n\n-- Are Warren and Sanders \u201c100% grassroots-funded?\u201d Not really. Salvador Rizzo checks the facts: \u201cSanders and Warren say they\u2019re running presidential campaigns funded '100%' by grass-roots donors. It\u2019s a big claim with no wiggle room. Money is fungible, so it\u2019s an artifice to claim that money from wealthy donors last time around isn\u2019t being used this time around. The key here is that Sanders and Warren define their presidential campaigns as entirely grass-roots-funded because of their self-imposed restrictions: no hobnobbing with rich donors in closed events and no PAC money, for example. But Warren held high-dollar fundraisers for her 2018 Senate run, and then transferred $10.4 million from that campaign account to her presidential committee. Her Senate run raised $6 million from donors who gave $1,000 or more, and she also took some PAC contributions. Sanders in 2015 sought and received big checks from wealthy donors. Sanders\u2019s 2020 committee so far has gotten $4.6 million from his prior presidential campaign. These are omissions worthy of Two Pinocchios. As a share of total fundraising, however, Sanders was less dependent than Warren on high-dollar contributions in his previous campaign.\u201d\n\n-- A cold call from Harry Reid changed Warren\u2019s life. From NBC News: \u201cWarren was a professor at Harvard Law \u2026 preparing barbecue and peach cobbler for a group of students \u2026 The phone rang. The owner of the faint voice on the other end of the line was well known, but they had never met. \u2018Who?\u2019 Warren asked. \u2018Harry Reid,\u2019 he replied. \u2018Majority leader, U.S. Senate.\u2019 That was November 2008, when the economy was imploding, and Reid was offering her a spot on a new commission overseeing the Wall Street bailout Congress had just approved. \u2026 At the time, Professor Warren was blogging for Talking Points Memo and about as well known as a policy wonk can be \u2014 which is to say not very. She had expressed zero political ambition, never run for office and her only real brush with Washington ended years earlier in a demoralizing loss when Congress passed a bankruptcy bill over her objections. \u2026 Warren said yes right away and so began \u2018When Harry met Liz,\u2019 a political saga that continues to this day. \u2018Everyplace she's been, she's been extremely good, for lack of a better way to explain it,\u2019 the understated Reid told NBC News in an interview.\u201d\n\n-- Sanders is pushing an \u201cinequality tax\u201d to punish companies where CEOs earn far more than workers. Jeff Stein and Chelsea Janes report: \u201cUnder Sanders\u2019 plan, the government would increase a firm\u2019s corporate tax rate if its highest-paid employee earns more than 50 times that of its average worker -- an attempt to encourage companies to distribute their profits more equally. The plan would only apply to companies with more than $100 million in annual revenue. \u2026 Critics say Sanders\u2019 plan would likely hurt companies with a large number of low-wage workers by forcing them to hire less talented CEOs, reducing the overall competitiveness of U.S. firms. Brian Riedl, a budget expert at the conservative think-tank the Manhattan Institute, said such a tax could dramatically affect industries like fast food or retail that naturally pay lower wages, while leaving others -- such as Silicon Valley -- relatively unscathed.\u201d\n\n-- Biden\u2019s campaign has sharply scaled back his online advertising, a move strategists say reflects his lack of popularity among the digitally active. From the Times: \u201cIn a race where many voters are following politics on their smartphones, Mr. Biden\u2019s pullback is an unusual and potentially worrisome sign about his appeal among the Democratic activists, young people and donors who are especially engaged on social media. \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s clear that there\u2019s something in the numbers that\u2019s directing them to go in that direction, and the likeliest explanation is that the rate of return just wasn\u2019t there for Facebook and Google,\u2019 said Tim Lim, a veteran Democratic digital strategist unaligned in 2020. \u2018Which is very, very unusual.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Today is the final day of the third fundraising quarter. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) may still quit the 2020 race by Tuesday, despite receiving an \u201cavalanche of support.\u201d \u201cWe have nearly 35,000 donors helping us make this goal, we\u2019ve raised $1.5m plus, we\u2019ve actually already crossed the threshold for the November debates of 165,000 unique donors. So the surge and the momentum\u2019s great but yeah, I still need help in this final 36 hours,\u201d he said. (The Guardian)\n\n-- Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s campaign manager said the former Obama housing secretary won\u2019t end his presidential bid if he\u2019s unable to qualify for the fifth Democratic debate.
