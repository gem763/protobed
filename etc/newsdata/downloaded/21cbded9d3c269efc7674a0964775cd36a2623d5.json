In fact, they've taken things to the next level by touching tongues in an Instagram video. Which yes, might cause you to have terrifying flashbacks to that viral-in-a-scary-way Shawn Mendes Camila Cabello kiss, so I'll give you a moment.\n\nAnyway, yeah, Miley and Cody just shared a clip of themselves cozied up in bed together using an absolutely terrifying Joker movie filter that will haunt my nightmares for years to come. And trust: watching two people, no matter how hot they are, put their tongues together in clown masks is a lot for a Monday morning with no coffee. So don't say I didn't warn you:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, Cody and Miley have only been dating for a few weeks in the wake of Miley's recent breakup with Kaitlynn Carter (and Liam Hemsworth!) but they appear to be getting pretty serious?\n\nAt least that's the vibe I'm getting from Cody, who told People, \"I\u2019m very happy. We are very, very happy. She\u2019s creative. She\u2019s very passionate about what she does, and I\u2019m very similar in that sense. That\u2019s why we get along so well. We just have a ball, yeah, and that\u2019s the most important part of a relationship, you know? The reason why it hasn\u2019t been a really crazy sudden thing is just because we\u2019ve been friends for so long...[we] found each other again in a space where we\u2019re both not partying, working real hard, and it just keeps things healthy and it\u2019s good.\"\n\nCute! But before we go, here's this *scampers away*:\n\nView photos Photo credit: Giphy More\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Wow, just when I'd recovered from Camila and Shawn.", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lcg_WgkOh1e1Eofpv4Ua2A--~B/aD02NDA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/4cfafb93744138784251d6f3f23980aa", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
