Finance and economic policy must complement it now,\u201d she told German weekly Der Spiegel on Friday.\n\nSuch calls have been mainly aimed at economic powerhouse Germany, and so far fallen on deaf ears.\n\nAs the global outlook worsens, observers are hoping that could change under Lagarde who counts Merkel as \u201ca dear friend\u201d.\n\n-\u2018Dusty language\u2019 \u2013\n\nUsed to being the only woman in the room, Lagarde has vowed to tackle the gender gap in the higher echelons of the ECB.\n\n\u201cI would dearly like to see more women in the financial world and to make their voices heard,\u201d she told Spiegel.\n\nLagarde is expected to soon be joined at the bank by respected German economist Isabel Schnabel, who is going through the nomination process.\n\nIf confirmed, they will be the only two women on the bank\u2019s council and board.\n\nLagarde has also set herself the goal of communicating more clearly, promising she would \u201cbring the ECB and its monetary policy closer to a broad public\u201d.\n\nOn climate change too, Lagarde sees room for improvement.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s core mandate is \u201cprice stability of course\u2026 (but) climate change and environmental risks are mission critical,\u201d she said during her grilling by Brussels lawmakers, adding that she backed a \u201cgradual transition\u201d of the bank\u2019s investments to greener projects.\n\nDraghi will on Monday hand over a replica of the chairman\u2019s bell to his successor.\n\nThe real thing will be waiting in the governing council\u2019s meeting room on the 41st floor of the gleaming ECB skyscraper.\n\nLagarde officially takes up the post on November 1.", "description": "Frankfurt am Main (AFP) \u2013 ECB chief Mario Draghi bows out Monday, passing the baton to former IMF head Christine Lagarde whose first task will be to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/695c6e_christine-lagarde-is-mario-draghi-as-head-european-central-bank-on-ciao-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
