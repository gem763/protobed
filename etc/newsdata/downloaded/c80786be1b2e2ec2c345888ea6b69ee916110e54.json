FB 0.03% CEO Mark Zuckerberg will travel to Capitol Hill on Thursday to pitch his vision for moderate internet regulation and seek to placate lawmakers who are weighing tougher moves.\n\n\u201cMark will be in Washington, D.C. to meet with policy makers and talk about future internet regulation,\u201d a company spokeswoman said. \u201cThere are no public events planned.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of a series of disclosures about Facebook business practices, lawmakers have been considering stringent new regulation of internet platforms in areas such as user privacy and content moderation. No action appears imminent on any of the measures.\n\nBut one idea that has gained attention is placing new limits on the sweeping legal immunity that platforms enjoy for harms caused by their users.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg was expected to pitch lawmakers on a different vision of internet regulation, one that includes more self-regulation by the companies.\n\nThe visit also will give Mr. Zuckerberg a chance to tout progress in Facebook\u2019s compliance with a recently-announced $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over privacy missteps.\n\nThe Facebook founder is expected to meet with Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), who is chairman of the Senate antitrust subcommittee. Facebook is under antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, and could soon face a separate investigation by the Justice Department. Mr. Lee has raised concerns about possible duplication of effort by the federal agencies.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s trip to Washington was reported earlier by Axios.\n\nThe visit represents Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s first foray into Capitol Hill since two days of hearings in spring 2018. At the time, following damaging revelations about Facebook\u2019s privacy practices, Mr. Zuckerberg said that it was \u201cinevitable that there will need to be some regulation.\u201d But he also cautioned lawmakers, \u201cYou have to be careful about what regulations you put in place.\u201d\n\nWrite to John D.
