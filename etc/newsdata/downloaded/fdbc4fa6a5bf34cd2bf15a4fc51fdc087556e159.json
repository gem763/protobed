Biden calls for capping payments at 5% of discretionary income, while also delaying payments for anyone making less than $25,000, with the borrower accruing no additional interest.\n\nBiden's plan would forgive any remaining debt after 20 years of payments and would allow borrowers to get out of their debts as part of personal bankruptcy.\n\nSanders, conversely, proposes eliminating all student loan debt, while Warren calls for broad debt relief based on income.\n\nWarren's idea would cancel $50,000 in debt for each person with household income under $100,000, with additional proportional relief for those making up to $250,000 annually.\n\nBiden and Warren have another noticeable split on for-profit colleges, which have come under scrutiny because their graduates have a much higher default rate on loans as they struggle to find quality jobs. Biden proposes tighter regulations on those colleges to stop them 'from profiteering off of students.' Warren calls for banning such businesses from getting federal money altogether.\n\nAll three Democratic hopefuls point to proposed tax increases to pay for their spending. Sanders would tax Wall Street transactions. Warren points to her 'wealth tax,' 2 cents on every dollar of a household's net worth beyond $50 million. Biden calls for eliminating certain breaks in inheritance taxes and capping itemized deductions for the wealthiest Americans.", "description": "Biden wants a federal-state partnership to make community and technical college free, expanded Pell Grants and cutting income caps on student loan repayments from 10% to 5%.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/20/19458994-0-image-a-42_1570564575075.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
