Would anyone? Plain tofu with plain rice and a baby corn cob from a tin?\n\n\u201cWhy do you think vegetarians don\u2019t like food? Please do better.\u201d\n\nBritish Airways replied to admit the meal looked a 'little sad' and asked which meal Carolyn had requested, before saying they'll 'make sure this is fed back to our catering team (no pun intended)'.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nDirector and screenwriter Carolyn added: \"The flight attendant saved me by finding me another meal, but this was truly pathetic and happens to vegetarians so often.\n\n\"Please tell your caterers we are not rabbits. We like good hearty meals! And we like proper pudding, not just melon.\"\n\nWhen contacted for comment, British Airways said: \"We pride ourselves on the quality of the meals we offer on board, and have heavily invested in our catering, in all cabins.\n\n\"Customers can pre-order from 14 special meals, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, kosher, low calorie, and low salt options.\n\n\"We are in touch with our customer and are investigating with our supplier.\"", "description": "Carolyn told British Airways 'we are not rabbits' and to 'do better' after being served the meal on a flight to Heathrow", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Carolyn Saunders Twitter", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20590647.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Flight-vegetarian-meal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
