REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch\n\nThe legislation was proposed after police launched nationwide raids on subcontracting delivery firms in February and uncovered numerous cases of social security fraud and drivers working off the books.\n\n\u201cSub-sub-sub contractors are working in many areas. Wages are being pushed down and social insurance contributions are not being made and we won\u2019t put up with this any longer,\u201d Labour Minister Hubertus Heil told journalists.\n\n\u201cOften black sheep in this sector are exploiting people from central and eastern Europe. That distorts competition.\u201d\n\nLabour lawyers say the new rules are likely to push up costs for those logistics and ecommerce companies which have turned a blind eye to the way subcontractors treated workers in the past.\n\nMost logistics companies in Germany use subcontractors, including Amazon (AMZN.O), which is now also expanding its own delivery network.\n\nBernd Gschaider, Germany director for Amazon Logistics, told Reuters on Tuesday the proposed legislation would not have any impact on Amazon\u2019s business because it already demanded its subcontractors complied with German labour law.\n\nAmazon\u2019s move into logistics poses a threat to players like former state monopoly Deutsche Post DHL(DPWGn.DE), which uses relatively well paid employees to do its deliveries rather than subcontractors.\n\nWhile booming ecommerce has driven a surge in parcel volumes in recent years, fierce competition among logistics companies has meant that prices have not kept pace with costs, prompting Deutsche Post to issue a profit warning last year.\n\n\u201cWe want fair competition. We don\u2019t want decent companies to be the dumb ones,\u201d Heil said.\n\nThe minister made his comments during a visit to a Deutsche Post distribution centre on the outskirts of Berlin, where employees were loading vans with parcels.\n\n\u201cThis company shows that you can do it in a decent way. Workers here are permanently employed, with proper social insurance, decent working conditions and fair wages,\u201d Heil said.\n\nThe proposed legislation seeks to extend to the parcel sector rules that already cover the construction and meat processing sectors: these make companies liable if their subcontractors fail to pay social security contributions for their workers.\n\nHeil said he hoped parliament, where the coalition government has a clear majority, would approve the law before Christmas, the busiest season for the parcel sector.\n\nThe government is also planning a law to fight illicit employment more broadly and has pledged to increase the number of customs police who are responsible for enforcing labour laws.", "description": "The German cabinet approved a draft law on Wednesday to force logistics and ecommerce companies that outsource deliveries to ensure that their subcontractors pay proper social security contributions for their drivers.", "authors": ["Emma Thomasson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431169458&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0NC", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
