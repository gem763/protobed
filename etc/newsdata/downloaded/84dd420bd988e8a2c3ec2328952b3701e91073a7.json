REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\nParker wrote, directed and stars in the movie about an African-American father seeking justice for his teenage son killed in a stand-off with police.\n\nHe plays Linc, who agrees to a student film crew following him around and interviewing him about 14-year old Kijani\u2019s death.\n\nHopeful for a trial, Linc is horrified when the police officer who shot Kijani will not be charged but return to duty and decides to take matters into his own hands.\n\n\u201cAmerican Skin\u201d, which premieres at the Venice Film Festival on Sunday, is Parker\u2019s first movie since 2016\u2019s \u201cBirth of a Nation\u201d stumbled after renewed public interest in a 1999 rape charge against the filmmaker, of which he was acquitted.\n\nAt the time, Parker addressed the case in interviews and on Facebook, saying he was devastated to learn his female accuser had taken her own life in 2012, but said he would not apologize over the case, instead asking people to look beyond it and focus on the film.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot in the last three years, it\u2019s been a journey of wisdom, talking to people ... and learning more about myself,\u201d Parker told a news conference.\n\n\u201cThe reality is I was quite tone deaf ... to a lot of the things that were happening in the climate, my response during that time, obviously hurt a lot of people, frustrated and angered a lot of people and I apologize to them. I\u2019m still learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican Skin\u201d flips between flashbacks of Linc and Kijani together and the shooting to the present Linc seeking justice.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a film that has affected me this deeply in a while,\u201d said veteran director Spike Lee who sat by Parker, explaining why he was supporting the movie.\n\n\u201cAmerican Skin\u201d is screening out of competition at the festival. Organizers have faced criticism for including it in the program as well as \u201cAn Officer and a Spy\u201d by Roman Polanski, who has a U.S. sex crime conviction.\n\n\u201cI feel very blessed that the Venice Film Festival recognized what the film could mean for society and so graciously allowed us to be here,\u201d Parker said.\n\nThe movie, which Parker said was shot in April, shows a clear divide between supporters of Linc and the police.\n\n\u201cThis film is about being the bridge between those two sides, but first recognizing their humanity,\u201d Parker said. \u201cAnd then being on the level to talk about what they see and what they feel everyday.\u201d\n\nAsked about the film\u2019s distribution, producer Mark Burg said: \u201cNo distributors have seen the movie yet ... The first opportunity is at tonight\u2019s screening.\u201d\u201dIt\u2019s a story that needs to be told.\u201d\n\nParker briefly broke down in tears when asked about his future career.\n\n\u201cI do have a lot of stories I want to tell because I feel like the world is broken,\u201d he said, citing gun violence and the plight of women worldwide.\n\n\u201cIt is my prayer that I\u2019ll be able to tell more stories ... and I hope moving forward that I get that opportunity.\u201d", "description": "Filmmaker Nate Parker apologized on Sunday for being \"tone deaf\" three years ago when a decades-old rape charge derailed his directorial debut, as he seeks to make a return with police violence drama \"American Skin\".", "authors": ["Marie-Louise Gumuchian", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190901&t=2&i=1425162404&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8022S-OCAEN"}
