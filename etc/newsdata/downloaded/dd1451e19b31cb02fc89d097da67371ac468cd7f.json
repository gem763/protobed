Biden raised $15.2 million in the third quarter fundraising period, his campaign announced Thursday, putting him behind 2020 Democratic presidential rivals Sen. Bernard Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg in terms of money raised over the last three months.\n\nMr. Biden noted at a private fundraising event in California that he managed to post the total \u201cin the middle of summer\u201d \u2014 though that time frame is certainly not unique to his campaign. The third quarter covers July, August, and September.\n\nThe Biden campaign said they\u2019ve now raised $36.7 million since the campaign launched and that the last week of the quarter was his best in terms of online fundraising since early May.\n\nStill, Mr. Biden\u2019s total for the last three months trailed the $25.3 million haul Mr. Sanders\u2019 campaign had announced earlier this week and the $19.1 million brought in by Mr. Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\n\nThe announcement comes as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has not yet publicly released her third quarter fundraising totals, has gained on Mr. Biden in recent polling and as he deals with the ongoing controversies surrounding his son\u2019s business ties in Ukraine and China.\n\nFurther down the list, Sen. Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million, entrepreneur Andrew Yang raised about $10 million, and Sen. Cory Booker raised more than $6 million.\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson\u2019s campaign announced on Thursday that the self-help guru raised more than $3 million in the last quarter, and Sen. Michael Bennet raised $2.1 million.\n\nMeanwhile President Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee combined to raise a record $125 million last quarter and ended the period with more than $156 million cash on hand.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
