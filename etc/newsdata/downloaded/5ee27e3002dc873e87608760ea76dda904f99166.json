Democrats have alleged Mr. Trump used the aid as leverage to prod Ukraine\u2019s leaders into investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nMr. Morgan slammed the inquiry as a \u201cself-proclaimed impeachment inquiry,\u201d saying the lack of a vote \u201ccalls into question your commitment to fundamental fairness and due process rights.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence is the latest administration official to buck Democrats\u2019 demands for documents. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought also said they will not comply with subpoenas for documents.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
