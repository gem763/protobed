And you thought there was no common ground between left and right.\n\nCount me among those not cheered. Mr. Bolton calls himself an Americanist, meaning he believes this nation must be strong and resolute enough to daunt its enemies (because enemies we shall always have), and reassure its friends (because friends are good and useful to have).\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s former national security adviser is no proponent of nation-building in the sense of planting democracy in arid soils. At the same time, he recognizes that if the United States doesn\u2019t shoulder some significant global responsibilities, no other nation \u2014 and certainly no transnational organization \u2014 will.\n\nMy point is not that you \u2014 or, more consequentially, Mr. Trump \u2014 should admire Mr. Bolton\u2019s moustache and agree with his every policy preference. My point is that Mr. Bolton has been providing the president with strategic thinking grounded in a serious reading of our adversaries\u2019 histories, ideologies, intentions and capabilities.\n\nH.R. McMaster, who preceded Mr. Bolton as national security adviser, did the same. Their personalities are very different \u2014 Gen. McMaster is an even-tempered soldier/scholar, Ambassador Bolton a bit of a firebrand \u2014 but both brought to the Oval Office useful perspectives and reasoned policy options.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s departure was reportedly precipitated when Mr. Trump began to consider giving in to demands from Iran\u2019s rulers to relieve economic pressure on them as a pre-condition for new talks about their nuclear weapons program, support for terrorists, imperialist aggression and other malign activities.\n\nTo do so would repeat one of President Obama\u2019s worst errors: The lifting of sanctions following an interim agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2013.\n\nFrom that point on, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, perceiving that concluding a deal had become politically essential to Mr. Obama, made no concessions. Mr. Obama\u2019s negotiators, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, made one after another. Had the talks been a poker game, Mr. Kerry would have come home shirtless.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that Mr. Trump did not have Mr. Bolton advising him over the weekend when Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest oil production facilities were attacked with drones and cruise missiles.\n\nHouthi rebels in Yemen, funded, armed and instructed by Tehran, quickly claimed credit. Almost as quickly, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he wasn\u2019t buying it. \u201cThere is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAmid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply.\u201d\n\nBased on U.S. intelligence reports, administration officials believe the guided munitions were launched from the north \u2014 from Iranian soil.\n\nWherever they came from, we can confidently conclude that Iran\u2019s rulers were responsible. The reason for the Houthi claim: To provide those rulers with sufficient \u201cplausible deniability\u201d to satisfy their sympathizers and apologists, a not insignificant coterie in both Washington and Europe.\n\nThe benefit of such subterfuge became apparent when, just hours after the attack, Iran\u2019s rulers offered to help shore up the global economy by increasing their oil output to make up for the 5 percent of global supplies that their act of war has put offline.\n\nTalk about arsonists volunteering to assist the fire brigade. Oh and by the way, in exchange for that favor, they really must insist that the United States lift its silly sanctions.\n\nThe faux goodwill was soon replaced by menace. \u201cEverybody should know that all American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles,\u201d an Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard commander noted on Sunday. In case President Trump failed to catch his drift, he added: \u201cIran has always been ready for a \u2018full-fledged\u2019 war.\u201d\n\nAmbassador Bolton would not take such threats lightly. He\u2019d suggest the president review a list of punitive responses. That does not imply another \u201cendless war.\u201d It does imply inflicting pain on the theocratic regime.\n\nAn interesting question: Did Iran\u2019s rulers figure that with the administration\u2019s leading hawk out of the picture, now would be the perfect time to flex their muscles and do some damage to an American strategic partner and the global economy? Sophisticated attacks require preparation but who\u2019s to say that the pieces were not already in place awaiting the right opportunity?\n\nAs President Trump considers his options, he should remember a cardinal rule: If we reward aggression, we\u2019ll get more of it. This episode also should remind us how foolish we would be ever to allow a regime whose slogan for 40 years has been \u201cDeath to America!\u201d to acquire nuclear warheads and missiles that can deliver them anywhere on the planet.\n\nI\u2019m confident Secretary Pompeo, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and CIA Director Gina Haspel get all that, and are counseling Mr. Trump accordingly.\n\nNevertheless, I\u2019d sleep better if Ambassador Bolton were still on the job. He\u2019d be the loudest and most vehement voice opposing both appeasement and isolationism.\n\nHe\u2019d tell the president plainly that America cannot become great again by submitting to Islamist bullies who will probe with their bayonets so long as they feel mush, stopping only when they hit steel. He\u2019d warn against recycling Mr. Obama\u2019s failed policies. You see why I\u2019m not cheered by his departure from the White House?\n\n\u2022 Clifford D.
