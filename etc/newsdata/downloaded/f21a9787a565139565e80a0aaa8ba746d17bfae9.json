Yet, after Scott Morrison\u2019s miracle May victory, the Liberals are proudly boasting of their status as the natural party of government. Since its formation in 1946 by Robert Menzies, the Liberal Party has been in federal government for almost two-thirds of its existence. This is a political achievement rightly worth celebrating. But the challenge now facing the Liberals is to avoid the hubris and complacency that electoral success can breed. Does the Liberal Party view its hold on the government benches as an end in itself? Or will the privilege of government be seized as a means of giving the nation the economic leadership it urgently needs? That is a critical question now that it has unexpectedly won itself a third term in office. How it answers will define the character and legacy of the Morrison government.\n\nThe Liberal Party that Menzies created promised to represent the \u2018forgotten people\u2019 - the vast middle classes of the nation whose interests were neglected by the organised political forces of capital and labour. Menzies\u2019 party rejected operating as an instrument of big business; but its major and historic achievement during Menzies\u2019 long residence in the Lodge between 1949 and 1966 was to successfully defend the liberal principles of individualism and free enterprise by resisting global trends towards greater state control and expansion of the role and size of government.\n\nScott Morrison on election night. What does the party do with its win. The Sydney Morning Herald\n\nThe people who Mr Morrison says are forgotten today are the \u201cQuiet Australians\u201d - or the \u2018aspirationals\u2019 toiling in the suburbs - in whose name the Prime Minister promises to govern. But is the Morrison Government a liberal government in the Menzian sense? The modern Liberal Party confronts a more complex political world than in Menzies\u2019 era, when the epoch defining ideological struggle pitted liberalism against the forces of socialism and communism. Today, centre-right parties globally are being pulled in illiberal directions by the forces of populism, nationalism, and neo-conservatism that favour government intervention over markets, to achieve naked political objectives in policy areas such as trade and immigration.\n\nAustralia\u2019s near three-decades of unbroken economic growth is the dividend of the economic reforms of the 1980s and 1990s that have insulated Australia from the worst of the illiberal trends evident in the US, UK, and much of Europe. For this we can also thank Menzies, who allowed Bert Kelly, the original Modest Member and celebrated columnist with The Australian Financial Review, to start agitating from the back bench against tariff protectionism and government regulation generally. So was born the economic \u2018dry\u2019 faction in the Liberal Party that provided the intellectual and policy drive for the reforms of the Hawke and Howard governments. Mr Howard, now often seen as more a \u201cconservative\u201d, preceded the economic liberalism of the Hawke-Keating Labor governments when he commissioned the Campbell committee that provided the blueprint for the financial market deregulation of the 1980s. Back then, he was positioned against the Liberal \u201cwets\u201d - more socially progressive but also more economically interventionist - and the old Tory instincts of rural-Liberal Malcolm Fraser.\n\nBut despite this proud liberal heritage, the modern Liberal Party is not immune to rising ill-liberalism, as is evident in the tone and direction of the Morrison government so far. Bashing business might play well politically by pitting \u2018elites\u2019 against \u2018ordinary\u2019 voters. But when banks are threatened with greater regulation because some customers won\u2019t shop around for a cheaper mortgage, the policy direction is illiberal by definition. Menzies swept to office in 1949 defending private banks from nationalisation by Labor. The May election proved the Quiet Australians still want to be left alone by governments. But sparking the economy for the benefit of all requires some hard-but-liberal reforms in electorally sensitive areas like workplace relations that might disquiet some Quiet Australians. Genuine political leadership, combined with policy substance, is needed.\n\nAn un-liberal Liberal Party might well stay in power. But what the country needs in the view of the Financial Review is a genuinely liberal government. To be truly worthy of mantle of Menzies, the Morrison Government must move beyond right-wing populism and get on with the hard work of helping Australians create a more prosperous and secure nation.", "description": "The Liberal Party's 75th anniversary is no cause for hubris.
