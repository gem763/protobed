Each will receive nine million Swedish kronor (\u00a3740,000), as well as a medal and a diploma.\n\nThe 2018 Nobel Prize was delayed by a year after a crisis in the academy sparked by allegations against Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of Academy member Katarina Frostenson. He was sentenced to two years in prison in October after being convicted of rape.\n\nFrostenson stepped down, and the events also led to allegations of conflict of interest and the leaking of Nobel winners' names. It all resulted in \"reduced public confidence in the Academy\", according to the awards body.\n\nHandke's plaudits and controversy\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Handke was met by protests when he received the International Ibsen Award in Oslo in 2014\n\nHandke, credited as one of the most thought-provoking writers in the German language, burst onto the literary scene in the 1960s and \"has for some decades been one of the most influential writers of contemporary fiction\", the Nobel judges said.\n\nHis most popular works include A Sorrow Beyond Dreams, published in 1975, which dealt with his mother's suicide in 1971.\n\nThe committee members said they had also been \"struck\" by 2017 book Die Obstdiebin. \"With great artistry, he explores the periphery and unseen places,\" they said.\n\nHe has also collaborated with film director Wim Wenders, including on the script for the Bafta-nominated 1987 film Wings of Desire.\n\nBut he is an outspoken figure, and some of his comments have proved offensive. He once denied the Serbian massacre at Srebenica and compared Serbia's fate to that of Jews during the Holocaust - although he later apologised for that \"slip of the tongue\".\n\nIn 1999 he returned Germany's prestigious Buechner prize in protest at Nato's bombing of Belgrade, and was forced to reject another German prize - the Heinrich Heine award - after an outcry in 2006.\n\nSir Salman Rushdie named Handke \"Moron of the Year\" in an article for The Guardian in 1999 for his \"series of impassioned apologias for the genocidal regime of Slobodan Milosevic\".\n\nWhen Handke came to collect the International Ibsen Award in Norway in 2014, he was greeted with demonstrators chanting \"fascist\" and holding placards calling him a \"genocide denier\".\n\nTokarczuk 'looks at life from above'\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Tokarczuk took part in an equality march in Wroclaw, Poland, at the weekend\n\nTokarczuk, 57, considered the leading Polish novelist of her generation, was rewarded \"for a narrative imagination that with encyclopaedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life\".\n\nThe author is a Polish best-seller whose books blend the real with the mystical.\n\nHer debut novel was published in 1993, and her breakthrough came three years later with Primeval and Other Times, which is set in a mythical village and traced Poland's history from World War One to the 1980s.\n\n\"She's a writer preoccupied by local life, but at the same time inspired by maps and speculative thought, looking at life from above,\" the judges said.\n\nHer work \"centres on migration and cultural transitions\" and \"is full of wit and cunning\", they added.\n\nLast year, she won the Man Booker International Prize for Flights, more than a decade after it was originally published in Poland.\n\nThe Nobel committee was also \"very impressed\" with her epic historical novel The Books of Jacob, set in the 18th Century, which \"presents a rich panorama of a little-known chapter in European history\".\n\nTokarczuk co-wrote the screenplay for the crime film Spoor, which was the country's entry for the best foreign language film at the 2018 Oscars.\n\nA political activist who does not shy away from criticising Poland's right-wing government, she has become the 15th female winner of the Nobel Prize out of 116 literature laureates.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
