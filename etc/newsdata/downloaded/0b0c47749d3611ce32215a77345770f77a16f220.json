Dr. O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s deep portfolio of research includes the study of triggers that may cause heightened sensitivity of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and the effectiveness of therapies based on this sensitivity.\n\nTNBC is a high-risk breast cancer with few effective options for patients. It usually affects younger women, African American women, and women with a BRCA1 genetic mutation. Compared with other breast cancer subtypes, TNBC is associated with a worse prognosis, including shorter time to recurrence in early-stage diseases (within 3 years) and a shorter time between recurrence and death in the metastatic setting (between 9-12 months).\n\n\u201cAt The Mary Kay Foundation, our mission is to eradicate cancers that affect women around the world, and each year we invest millions in groundbreaking research and support for organizations like Baylor Scott & White,\u201d said Dr. Lucy Gildea, Chief Scientific Officer of Mary Kay Inc. \u201cWe\u2019re honored to help fund Dr. O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s potentially lifesaving research, and we look forward to following along and learning how these results might impact the prognosis of metastatic TNBC patients in the future.\u201d\n\nDr. O\u2019Shaughnessy has focused her research on the metastatic TNBC population due to the very high, unmet medical need. Dr. O\u2019Shaughnessy has worked with Baylor Scott & White Research Institute, which oversees research efforts and provides staffing and other clinical support for the healthcare system, to also design and develop Investigator Initiated Studies examining TNBC.\n\n\u201cThe goal of this work is to understand more about the pathways that might allow patients to achieve highly durable complete responses to their treatment and to determine the molecular characteristics of TNBCs that predict the benefit from different treatment strategies,\u201d said Dr. O\u2019Shaughnessy. \u201cThis type of work could expand the options available to patients with metastatic diseases and bring greater hope to those in need.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in Texas, Baylor Scott & White relies upon generous donations from organizations like The Mary Kay FoundationSM to continue our innovative research on behalf of patients,\u201d said Rowland K. Robinson, president of Baylor Scott & White Dallas Foundation. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen promising results from Dr. O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s trials so far. And, with The Mary Kay Foundation\u2019s support, we\u2019re hopeful her important work will continue to help us gain additional insight to better serve those with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.\u201d\n\nOver the course of more than two decades, The Mary Kay FoundationSM has awarded more than $80 million to women\u2019s shelters and domestic violence service providers, as well as cancer research programs and related causes throughout the United States.\n\nAbout The Mary Kay Foundation\u2120\n\nGuided by Mary Kay Ash\u2019s dream to enrich the lives of women everywhere, The Mary Kay FoundationSM raises and distributes funds to invest in breakthrough cancer research to find a cure for women-related cancers and ending domestic violence against women. Since 1996, The Mary Kay FoundationSM has contributed more than $80 million to organizations aligned with its two-fold mission. In addition, the Foundation supports awareness initiatives, community outreach programs, and advocates for legislation to ensure women are healthy and safe. Together, we can make the world better for women.
