On Friday, Mr. Trump declined to say what the two leaders had discussed, saying, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption\u2014all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Trump said Sunday before leaving on a trip to Houston.\n\nThe president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has suggested Mr. Biden\u2019s pressure on Ukraine was motivated by an investigation by a government official of a gas company for which his son Hunter was a director. Mr. Biden, as vice president, did call for the ouster of a former Ukrainian prosecutor general, but his call was part of a broader effort by Ukrainian anticorruption investigators, European diplomats, U.S. allies and the U.S. State Department to overhaul a prosecutor\u2019s office that was widely viewed as corrupt. A Ukrainian official this year said he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. Trump repeatedly pressured his Ukrainian counterpart during the call to work with Mr. Giuliani on a Biden probe, according to people familiar with the matter. Those revelations came amid an escalating standoff between Democratic lawmakers and the Trump administration over a whistleblower complaint about Mr. Trump\u2019s communications with a foreign leader that may involve the Ukraine call.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden greeted guests at the Polk County Democrats' Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday.

Trump and Zelenky, Democrats in Congress and on the 2020 campaign trail pressed anew to begin impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cCongress failed to act and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law,\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren said Saturday in Iowa. \u201cHe has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system. It is time for us to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now.\u201d\n\nAdam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a close ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), said that impeachment \u201cmay be the only remedy\u201d if Mr. Trump was found to have courted foreign intervention in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cWe may very well have crossed the Rubicon here,\u201d Mr. Schiff said in an interview on CNN. \u201cThis would be, I think, the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during just about any presidency,\u201d Mr. Schiff added, while calling on the president to release both a transcript of the Ukraine call and the whistleblower complaint.\n\nMrs. Pelosi, however, has been reluctant to open an impeachment inquiry. In a letter to her House colleagues on Sunday, Mrs. Pelosi appeared to inch closer to such an inquiry as she called for the director of national intelligence to turn over the whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cIf the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,\u201d she wrote.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have largely been quiet about Mr. Trump\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky. Speaking to NBC on Sunday, Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), said it was \u201cnot appropriate for any candidate for federal office, certainly including a sitting president, to ask for assistance from a foreign country.\u201d Mr. Toomey quickly added: \u201cBut I don\u2019t know that\u2019s what happened here.\"\n\nThe scrutiny of Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with his Ukrainian counterpart is likely to escalate this week as Congress continues to probe the whistleblower complaint that was submitted last month to the inspector general of the intelligence community, who deemed it a significant matter of \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\nFederal whistleblowing law generally dictates that such a complaint should be sent to the congressional intelligence committees, but the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused to do so.\n\nMr. Maguire is to appear this week before both the Senate and House intelligence committees, where he will be asked about his decision not to share the complaint.\n\nWrite to Dustin Volz at dustin.volz@wsj.com and Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump appeared to confirm that he discussed Joe Biden and his son on a call with Ukraine\u2019s president, as some senior Democrats revived talk of impeachment over reports that the president asked a foreign government for a probe designed to damage his potential 2020 rival.", "authors": ["Dustin Volz", "Rebecca Ballhaus", "Dustin.Volz Wsj.Com", "Rebecca.Ballhaus Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109647/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
