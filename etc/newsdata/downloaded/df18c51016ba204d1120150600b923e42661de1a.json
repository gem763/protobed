I learn this as I\u2019m following him through Prairie Oaks Metro Park on the outskirts of Columbus, Ohio, because he\u2019d suggested it might be a good place for an adventure. But it had been unseasonably warm that week, and the snow that would have otherwise covered the ground had been transmuted into gloppy sludge. The mud at Prairie Oaks, by the way, is perfect. It stuck to my boots and held me fast to the ground, even as I was struggling to stay upright. It was as though I was standing on an ice floe in the Arctic somewhere, not on solid earth. Things, I\u2019ve learned, become unpredictable where humans meet nature.\n\nPeterson \u2014 better known as the YouTuber Coyote Peterson to his fans, who call themselves the Coyote Pack \u2014 has made a career out of that uncertainty. On camera, he handles the world\u2019s wildest animals, everything from stinging insects to giant lizards to bear cubs. The point, he says, is education. On his YouTube channel, Brave Wilderness, Peterson and his collaborators have amassed more than 14 million subscribers in almost five years. The videos routinely go viral, and in them, Peterson radiates an unmistakable enthusiasm for the creatures he\u2019s presenting to his audience. It\u2019s what\u2019s brought him to the latest peak in his career: a show on Animal Planet, the channel that broadcasts animals and their exploits to around 400 million households around the world. Animal Planet is the network that made Steve Irwin into the Crocodile Hunter and the place that turned Jeff Corwin into a household name. For Coyote and his two cameramen \u2014 Brave Wilderness co-founder Mark Vins and wildlife biologist Mario Aldecoa \u2014 it\u2019s the biggest stage they\u2019ve ever been on, one that could turn them into global stars.\n\nThings become unpredictable where humans meet nature\n\nOr will it? A number of YouTube celebrities have gotten traditional TV deals, and nearly all of them have either petered out or failed outright because the audiences they\u2019ve found online don\u2019t necessarily translate into traditional television viewers.\n\nThat day at the park, in the mud, a week before leaving for Australia for their first seven-week Animal Planet shoot, Peterson doesn\u2019t seem perturbed by the challenges ahead of him. He\u2019s humming with enthusiasm, bounding through the mire, looking for any sign of animal life because we are there to find mink \u2014 \u201cMinking,\u201d he calls it. \u201cI just made up the term this morning, but we recently filmed an episode at this location about tracking mammals in the snow and realized that looking for mink is kind of a cool thing.\u201d He extols the animal\u2019s particular virtues. They\u2019re members of the weasel family, related to wolverines and badgers. \u201cIt just dawned on me that we probably won\u2019t see a mink today,\u201d he says, before we start our adventure. (So we\u2019re walking through that perfect mud for\u2026 what reason, exactly?) But if we wanted pictures of Coyote Peterson with a mink, he says, the Brave Wilderness team has some available.\n\nTo understand Peterson, you have to understand the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina). It\u2019s large and generally non-violent. It looks prehistoric, and the jury\u2019s still out on whether it bites hard enough to take off a finger.\n\n\u201cI wish you guys were here in the spring to actually see a snapping turtle. You\u2019d be like, \u2018Man, as like an eight-to-ten-year-old kid, you were catching this?\u2019\u201d Peterson says. \u201cThis turtle\u2019s big enough, if you got your arm in its mouth, it could feasibly pull you under and drown you. Not that it would, but... yeah, it was a dangerous animal to be working with.\u201d The snapping turtle features in his personal mythology as prominently as the crocodile did for Steve Irwin. The turtle is where Coyote Peterson began. (He got the nickname \u201cCoyote\u201d from his mother because he\u2019d chase roadrunners like the coyote from the cartoons while the roadrunners were hunting for horned lizards.) His well-rehearsed origin myth goes something like this:\n\nIn the spring of 2009, when he was 27 or 28, Nathaniel Peterson went to the arboretum in Cleveland to hike with his one-year-old daughter. He was catching frogs and showing them to her when he ran into a group of kids around a pond who were also looking for frogs. And then he saw it: a snapping turtle hunting along the bottom. He dove in, he came back up, and he explained to the gathering crowd the specific beauty of these turtles. His girlfriend at the time happened to be taking pictures. \u201cI brought them back and showed them to my producers I was working with at the time on some movie projects. Their minds were blown,\u201d he says. (Some of those narrative film projects, Peterson tells me, are still in development 15 years later.)\n\nThat was the beginning of The Reptile Show, which then became Breaking Trail, which eventually became Brave Wilderness. Peterson and his producers thought the time was ripe for a new animal adventurer in the mold of people who\u2019d been on Animal Planet before. \u201cSteve Irwin had already passed away. Jeff Corwin was making a cooking show at the time, I think. There was nobody else catching and presenting animals,\u201d Peterson says. There was Man vs. Wild, but that was it. Brave Wilderness launched in 2014, which means Peterson and his producers spent five years developing and shooting the show before anyone ever saw what they\u2019d made. They sent sizzle reels to people in the entertainment industry because the plan was never to be on YouTube. But nothing really happened until Discovery Digital Networks got in touch with the gang about a now-defunct online network the company was starting called Animalist \u2014 which is where Breaking Trail premiered \u2014 that would digitally distribute original web videos for Discovery.\n\n\u201cWe raised all of the funding to launch the original Breaking Trail episodes on our own,\u201d Peterson says. \u201cWe had a couple of partners of ours that are still involved that gave us just a small amount of seed money to get started, and we turned that seed money into what was supposed to be 12 episodes into 52 episodes.\u201d They ended up releasing between two and three videos a week, and they have been on that schedule for nearly four and a half years.\n\nNaturally, their first video featured the common snapping turtle. It has nearly all of the hallmarks of Peterson\u2019s later, more successful videos: there\u2019s the dramatic voice-over, the action cuts, the epic soundtrack, and the classic end tag: \u201cBe brave, stay wild, and we\u2019ll see you on the next adventure.\u201d (If you have autoplay turned on, after the sign-off, you\u2019ll see the familiar timer counting down to the next video \u2014 because, in the Brave Wilderness universe, there is always another video.) Peterson doesn\u2019t take vacations because that would be the same thing as doing the show but without any of the material benefits. He does say, however, that any time he\u2019s away from the cameras, it feels like a vacation.\n\nHere\u2019s where I tell you about danger. We\u2019re attracted to it because the possibility of violence is just the potential for sudden, transformative change; futures are rarely so clearly delineated or so predictable. The other part is biochemical: fear intensifies emotion, which is another way to say that it activates the sympathetic nervous system and floods your body with adrenaline. That\u2019s when you can lift cars or feel time slow down enough to make a split-second decision. Fear heightens. It drives. Out in the wild, the only border between you and the rest of the universe is the place where your skin meets the air, and that is a terrifying place to be. Most of us want our personal encounters with nature to be at least somewhat tamed \u2014 zoos, camping, hiking, climbing \u2014 and more controlled than unreconstructed. But in the popularity of series like Planet Earth, it\u2019s easy to discern that other human urge to see nature as it really is, an encounter with the world as it is when we\u2019re not paying attention.\n\nIn their videos, Peterson and his team access that particular feeling of being in nature and also strangers there. They manage the double trick of bringing the wild to your doorstep without seeming to disturb the creatures that live there. The crew has gone looking for toads, kissed moose in Alaska, chased crocodiles in Costa Rica, and hung out with stingrays in Arizona (which, as you may recall, is what killed Steve Irwin). It made them well-known on YouTube. What made them go viral, though, was The Sting Zone, an ongoing challenge where Peterson worked his way through entomologist Justin Schmidt\u2019s Sting Pain Index, a ranking of the most painful stings in the insect world. (Schmidt won his ranking the hard way: by being the first guy to intentionally get stung.) Peterson filmed himself working his way through the list, and nearly every single entry has gone massively viral.\n\n\u201cFor somebody in my field, usually, the goal is to not be bitten and stung.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor somebody in my field, usually, the goal is to not be bitten and stung,\u201d he says. (He makes sure to tell me he\u2019s generally very good at not being bitten and stung.) \u201cWe found that people were really fascinated with the effects of venom or pain on the human body, and it\u2019s always sort of been celebrated in that Coyote Peterson doesn\u2019t really say curse words, so we can keep it totally family-friendly while I\u2019m also being able to endure that pain and deliver educational tidbits as to what my body\u2019s going through, or this and that about the creepy crawly that was biting me or stinging me,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you why people love it as much as they do, but they do.\u201d (It seems obvious to me that people like the sting videos for the same reason that sites like Liveleak and the defunct Rotten.com are continually popular: people like seeing others in pain.)\n\nMario Aldecoa, the wildlife biologist and camera operator, says people just find it amusing. \u201cThey love it,\u201d he continues, but Peterson\u2019s real mission is education, \u201cwhich is going out featuring a species and a conservation group, and so on.\u201d Aldecoa\u2019s never been anxious about Peterson\u2019s well-being; they are professionals, after all.\n\nAldecoa\u2019s co-camera operator and director, Mark Vins, has a slightly different view. \u201cI have been nervous a couple of times on the more extreme end of things, namely the bullet ant, the tarantula hawk, and certainly some of the bite tests, specifically the alligator bite and the centipede,\u201d Vins says. After the centipede bite \u2014 the giant desert centipede, which hunts insects and small vertebrates at night \u2014 Peterson had to seek medical attention. That prompted Vins, Aldecoa, and Peterson to have a meeting and take stock of what exactly they were doing. \u201cThere has to be a limit for the science and education coming out of this,\u201d Vins says. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of getting on that edge of it not being safe.\u201d They knew they needed to get back to their animal adventure roots. \u201cWe knew we had to draw a line because otherwise it just keeps going, and then that takes you to places that you don\u2019t want to go.\u201d\n\nEven so, the sting zone has helped kids across the country, Peterson says. It\u2019s given them permission to be strong. \u201cWe have lots of people that will write to us and be like, \u2018My kid got stung by a hornet, and he or she would say, \u2018What would Coyote do in this instance? Be brave, be brave!\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was overcast when Peterson picked me up from my hotel in his limited-edition Jeep. We stopped for snacks at a gas station \u2014 because, in Peterson\u2019s words, \u201cevery good adventure is about snacks\u201d \u2014 before we headed out to the park, Bigfoot rearview mirror ornament swaying at every turn. Though I didn\u2019t see anyone eat any of the snacks, having them near felt comforting, as though we were loaded for bear, even though we would only be looking for mink. Tycho was on the stereo \u2014 he called it his video game music \u2014 and Peterson began to tell me about his die-hard Sonic the Hedgehog fandom. He\u2019s been playing since he was a kid, but now, it\u2019s what he does to relax. \u201cI play Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or 3 or Sonic and Knuckles,\u201d he told me, noting that he\u2019s not a fan just because Sonic happens to be a hedgehog. (It\u2019s not the only thing he plays. He\u2019s also had a few brief dalliances with Jurassic Park.)\n\nLater, after our adventure had concluded and we are safely seated in a local sandwich shop, Peterson goes into more detail. \u201cI set a personal best the other night playing Sonic 2. Thirty-nine extra guys, nine continues, which each continue is three extra guys,\u201d Peterson says. That\u2019s 66 chances to beat the final boss, Dr. Robotnik, an evil scientist who was created by accidentally fusing a rotten egg with the Chaos Emeralds (reservoirs of the bad in man, according to the original story). \u201cI can beat it, but I\u2026 don\u2019t,\u201d he says. In Sonic 2, you don\u2019t get any extra points for beating the final boss, Peterson notes. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to beat Robotnik without getting hit by anything, which is pretty tough to do. So I play it, at this point, just to get the points and the extra guys,\u201d he says, which is as good a way as any to describe Peterson\u2019s fame and presence on YouTube.\n\nAnimal Planet is the big leagues, and it\u2019s where he\u2019s hoping to make his mark on the world\n\nOnline, Brave Wilderness is ubiquitous, and Peterson has appeared on everything from First We Feast\u2019s \u201cHot Ones,\u201d where he revealed he\u2019s not so great with chicken wings, to Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s late night show, where he met his childhood idol, Jeff Goldblum. Getting more guys has made him a legitimate star. But when we\u2019re together, I have the distinct sense that Peterson feels like he\u2019s finally getting what he\u2019s always wanted: real fame, the kind that isn\u2019t constrained to being well-known online. \u201cI don\u2019t consider YouTubers famous people,\u201d he says, though he adds that a lot of other people would. \u201cI don\u2019t consider that fame in the way I think some people would?\u201d\n\nFor Peterson, Animal Planet is the big leagues, and it\u2019s where he\u2019s hoping to make his mark on the world. To prepare the Coyote Pack \u2014 the millions of animal-loving \u201c3-to-93\u201d-year-olds across the world \u2014 for the transition, the Brave Wilderness team made a 30-minute highlight reel of their previous exploits called \u201cCoyote Peterson: Return to the Wilderness,\u201d which is also meant to introduce Animal Planet\u2019s audience to Coyote. \u201cWe really focus on age five to 15 because that\u2019s, at least for me when I was growing up, the most influential point in my life where I felt like animals were a big focus,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Brave Wilderness team has decided to change their formula a little for Animal Planet: Both Vins and Aldecoa are going to be on-camera personalities along with Peterson as a kind of ensemble cast, departing from the formula set by Steve Irwin and company. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get a TV show in the conventional sense that they were like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to make a show, and Coyote\u2019s going to star in it,\u2019\u201d Peterson says. \u201cWe formed a partnership with the network.\u201d But even though Brave Wilderness is running the production for Animal Planet, Peterson feels that the fans might be a little hesitant to follow them to a new home. Eventually, he says, \u201cthey will realize this is Coyote, Mark, and Mario\u2019s vision. This is Coyote still writing the voice-over scripts. This is these guys producing the show for Animal Planet, and it\u2019s Animal Planet using their muscle as a network to help us get it to as big an audience as we can.\u201d Brave Wilderness will still be producing original content for its YouTube channel, which will act as an online companion to the as-yet-unnamed television show. \u201cYouTube is arguably the largest microphone on the face of the planet when it comes to reaching a younger audience demographic,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we will be able to greatly promote the Animal Planet series through YouTube.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing to Animal Planet is like getting drafted to the pros for us.\u201d\n\nAs Peterson notes later in our conversation, there aren\u2019t that many YouTubers who get television deals, and when they do, they sometimes lose their way. (\u201cI know Dude Perfect has a relationship with Nickelodeon,\u201d Peterson says. \u201cColleen Ballinger, who is Miranda Sings, did Netflix for a couple of seasons. Then there\u2019s a handful of other creators that have done the world of YouTube Red and stuff like that.\u201d) There aren\u2019t many who have successfully branched out into linear programming because it is fundamentally a different medium than the internet. TV\u2019s incentives seem similar \u2014 getting more people watching is generally the goal \u2014 but on YouTube, viewer engagement trumps views. Because of that, YouTube videos are generally less structured and more superficially shocking (and less, ahem, stinging) than their linear counterparts. There\u2019s more opportunity for viewer feedback, which is generally incorporated into the next episode. Television doesn\u2019t have that built-in feedback mechanism, and, to Peterson, it feels like growth. \u201cWhen it comes to partnering with Animal Planet, the way that I sometimes phrase it to people is if YouTube was like us playing college sports, going to Animal Planet is like getting drafted to the pros for us.\u201d\n\nLet me tell you more about that day at the park. In the parking lot, standing outside his Jeep, Peterson checks his reflection in another car\u2019s mirror. \u201cI loved action figures as a kid,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I was going to be an on-camera talent, I wanted to be like an action figure.\u201d\n\nThe sky seems a lot closer than it had been before in the more urban part of Columbus, where we\u2019re staying. Outside the Jeep\u2019s metal embrace, the wind picked up, and the park suddenly seemed unfriendly \u2014 an uncaring place less than tamed by people, far redder in tooth and claw. A coyote calls in the distance. \u201cWe\u2019re going to track these coyotes. They\u2019re on the other side of the river,\u201d Peterson says confidently. It\u2019s then that it hits me what his job at Brave Wilderness really is: to run toward the obvious danger and to be prepared enough to pick it up for the cameras and teach people about it. He makes a tentative plan for us to find them, which we abandon later. Even though there\u2019s no danger, for the briefest instant, I wonder what I\u2019ve gotten myself into, and I think again about what kind of person you have to be to pick up venomous creatures in the wild.\n\nEven though there\u2019s no danger, for the briefest instant, I wonder what I\u2019ve gotten myself into\n\nWe eventually leave the trail. Peterson takes us through fields that were recently disturbed by deer \u2014 he sniffs the scat \u2014 and helps me cross ground that was too flooded or muddy to pass through without difficulty. He has a real familiarity with the park; it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s hunted animals here before. A quarter of the way through our walk, I ask him about a particularly spiny tree. \u201cIt\u2019s a go-fuck-yourself tree,\u201d Peterson replies instantly, hilariously, before asking me to strike the curse from the record because Coyote Peterson doesn\u2019t say \u201cfuck.\u201d\n\nBut maybe he should. It was a genuinely unscripted moment, probably the first time I feel he\u2019s telling me something interesting instead of something heavily rehearsed, with its edges (or spines) sanded off. Later, we find beer cans, a tackle box, a whitened beaver tooth, an earthworm, a small fish, and, finally, beautifully, mink poop on a log. It isn\u2019t the prize that we came for, but it was really there.\n\nLater in the day, over a sandwich, I ask Coyote how he\u2019d describe our adventure. We hadn\u2019t found anything, after all, and now we\u2019re muddy and cold and tired.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, guys? Today, we\u2019re at Prairie Oaks Metro Park, one of the coolest places in Columbus to explore. We\u2019re on the far western side of the city. This environment is incredibly diverse. It\u2019s a place you can find X, Y, and Z animal, but today specifically, we\u2019re going after mink,\u201d he begins without a warm-up, as though he were delivering a voice-over to camera and not to me at a booth in a sandwich shop.\n\n\u201cMink are oftentimes hunting near rivers. What we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to press through the park, get ourselves to the edge of the water, and look for some environmental signs \u2014 could be droppings, could be tracks, could be just the smell of these mustelids because they have a very pungent scent to them, just like a skunk. And if you guys don\u2019t know, they\u2019re a cousin of the skunk. These are the signs we\u2019re looking for.\u201d I\u2019ve just come from this adventure, and yet I\u2019m still engrossed. Next, Peterson says, boom. We\u2019re heading into the environment, he says, where we find deer droppings \u2014 \u201csquish a deer turd between your fingers and smell it, be like, it doesn\u2019t really smell like anything, but for the audience, they\u2019re like, \u2018Holy cow, did he just squish a deer turd and smell it?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would have found that fish. We would have found the worm. Those would have just been little tidbits. But the payoff would have been getting to this epic log: \u2018Holy cow, this is where a mink lives. Let\u2019s spread out and look for it.\u2019\u201d Ideally, we would have found something in the log, he allows. \u201cWe would have gotten a glimpse of the mink and caught it on camera, and then, of course, that would have given us a wrap-up to be like, \u2018Such a cool adventure. We crossed through this, this, and this. Your boots are still dry. We saw a mink. Be brave, stay wild, we\u2019ll see you on the next adventure.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut, of course, we didn\u2019t find any mink. That\u2019s not how it happened.", "description": "Coyote Peterson has built up a millions-strong following for his YouTube channel Brave Wilderness.
