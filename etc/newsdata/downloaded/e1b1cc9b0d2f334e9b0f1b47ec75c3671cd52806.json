Last year, numerous actions had already taken place in 19 member states and a petition with 114,000 signatures had been handed over to the agriculture ministers of the EU.\n\nThe alliance also demands that livestock farming be species-appropriate and in smaller herds and that more funds to protect arable lands and restrict pesticide use be unlocked.", "description": "Hundreds of farmers joined forces on Tuesday (October 22) at a protest in front of the European Parliament in Strasbourg to call for a fairer and more sustainable agriculture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/09/86/1000x563_cmsv2_96fd0e2b-694d-59b1-9ba6-bb5f104ee3d0-4250986.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
