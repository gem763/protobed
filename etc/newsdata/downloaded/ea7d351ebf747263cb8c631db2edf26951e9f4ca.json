According to the ATF the store, \u201cknowingly transferred handguns to an out-of-state resident, made false entries in records, failed to report multiple sales of handguns and knowingly transferred firearms to a prohibited person.\u201d\n\nThe owners surrendered the federal license for the store and none of them will be eligible to reapply or engage in any way in the business of dealing guns. Approximately 390 firearms, silencers and receivers including rifles, shotguns and handguns were seized. They had a total approximate value of $224,000. Prior to the seizure, an indictment was filed against Scott Genung, a convicted felon. Police made several undercover gun purchases from Genung, who allegedly processed the sales himself. Officers say they observed him carrying a firearm on his person during those sales. He allegedly indicated to the undercover officers that he was responsible for many of the store operations, including placing an order from a distributor for a gun.\n\nGun control advocates claim that it\u2019s impossible for the ATF to go after \u201cbad apple\u201d dealers, but clearly that\u2019s not the case. The ATF found what sound be pretty clear violations of the law, and they\u2019re shutting down the store and kicking the owners out of the firearms business completely. The ATF can absolutely deal with \u201cbad apples\u201d. It\u2019s just that some of the gun stores gun control advocates claim are bad apples really aren\u2019t.\n\nThe fact is that while there are some genuine bad actors, there are also shops that may end up with a larger number of guns sold that end up in getting traced simply because of a high volume of sales. ATF regulations are no joke either. Far from being lax, ATF can shut down gun stores for simple paperwork violations, much less allowing guns to be transferred to a prohibited person, as was allegedly the case here.\n\nI\u2019m happy to hear the owners\u2019 side of the story, but given the fact that they\u2019ve surrendered their licenses and are permanently barred from working in the gun industry, I\u2019m guessing whatever the story is, they didn\u2019t feel like they were likely going to win in a court of law. It was likely an offer of \u201ctake this deal or we can go to trial and put you in federal prison for several years.\u201d It looks like that\u2019s where employee Scott Genung is headed, at least based on the evidence the ATF says it has.\n\nMeanwhile, anti-gun activists intent on shutting down all gun stores will continue to insist that the ATF doesn\u2019t have the tools it needs to go after shops like G2 Sports. If they acknowledge this story at all, it will only be to portray G2 Sports as indicative of all gun stores, and to use this case to argue for more gun laws and regulations that will put put more independent shops out of business. In that sense, the owners of G2 Sports didn\u2019t just hurt themselves, but responsible gun dealers as well.", "description": "An Indianapolis gun store has been shuttered, its inventory seized, and its owners barred from working in the gun industry after an ATF investigation.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/273/56786d70-9c86-4eb5-8c2a-5104d4ef080f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
