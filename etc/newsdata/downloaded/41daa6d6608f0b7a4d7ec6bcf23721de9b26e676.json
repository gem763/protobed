Thomas, who won the inaugural CJ Cup in 2017, bogeyed the 18th for a 70 and he and Lee were tied with a three-round total of 15-under 201 after three rounds.\n\nAustralian Cameron Smith was in third place, three strokes behind, after a 68. Jordan Spieth shot 70 and was in a three-way tie for fourth, four behind.\n\n\"I played well, I just didn't hit a lot of good putts that burned the edges and didn't quite go in,\" Thomas said. \"If a couple of those putts fall, I don't make a bad bogey on 18 and the other two bogeys I made, I hit good putts, they just caught the edge and lipped out.\"\n\n\"Obviously Danny's playing well, a lot of guys are playing well, so I need to go out and play well tomorrow. I just need to keep doing what I've done the last couple days and just get a little bit more out of it.\"\n\nLee said he was pleased to play well before his family and fans.\n\n\"I've never played exceptionally well in Korea, so I also felt I could play better in front of my Korean fans. On top of that my parents and my wife are Korean and my granddad lives here so that would be great. I am glad I had a strong showing this week and hopefully I can say the same tomorrow.\"\n\nThe biggest movers Saturday were last year's runner-up Gary Woodland and first-year professional Colin Morikawa of the United States. Their 65s moved them into a tie for seventh place which included Ian Poulter (66) and Graeme McDowell (68).\n\nDefending CJ Cup champion and top-ranked Brooks Koepka withdrew from the tournament before the third round after aggravating a left knee injury a day earlier when he slipped on wet concrete. J.B. Holmes also withdrew after the first nine holes of his third round with an unknown ailment.\n\nKoepka, playing his second event since stem cell treatment on the knee Aug. 25, shot a 3-over 75 on Friday at Nine Bridges after opening with a 69. He was 13 strokes behind Thomas in the limited-field event with no cut.\n\n\"After consulting with my doctor, I have decided to withdraw from the CJ Cup and head home for further tests,\" Koepka said in a statement. \"I appreciate everyone's concerns and support. I'll keep you posted as I learn more.\"\n\nKoepka returned to Florida to meet with his doctors, leaving his status for the HSBC Champions in two weeks in China uncertain. He missed the cut two weeks ago in his season debut at Las Vegas.\n\nThe CJ Cup is the first of three PGA Tour events in Asia, continuing next week at the Zozo Championship in Japan \u2014 which will feature Tiger Woods \u2014 and ending with the World Golf Championship event in Shanghai.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
