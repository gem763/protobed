Australian demonstrators called for their nation, which is the world\u2019s largest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas, to take more drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe Global Strike 4 Climate said protests will be staged in 110 towns and cities across Australia on Friday, with organizers demanding government and business commit to a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2030.\n\nSimilar rallies were planned Friday in cities around the globe. In the United States more than 800 events were planned Friday, while in Germany more than 400 rallies were expected.\n\nA similar coordinated protest in March that drew crowds around the world.\n\nThe protests are partly inspired by the activism of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who has staged weekly demonstrations under the heading \u201cFridays for Future\u201d over the past year, calling on world leaders to step up their efforts against climate change. Many who have followed her lead are students, but the movement has since spread to civil society groups.\n\nAustralian universities have said they will not penalize students for attending Friday\u2019s rallies, while Australian schools vary on what action, if any, they take against children who skip classes to attend demonstrations.\n\nSiobhan Sutton, a 15-year-old student at Perth Modern School, said she would fail a math exam by attending a protest in the west coast city of Perth.\n\n\u201cI have basically been told that because it is not a valid reason to be missing school \u2014 it is not a medical reason or anything \u2014 I am going to get a zero on the test if I don\u2019t actually sit it,\u201d she told Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\n\u201cEven though we ourselves aren\u2019t sick, the planet which we live on is, and we are protesting and fighting for it,\u201d she added.\n\nSiobhan said her math teacher had given her an option to sit the exam before Friday, but she was unable to do so because of her commitments as one of the protest organizers.\n\nThe demonstrations come as Australia\u2019s center-left opposition mulls abandoning its policy, rejected at May elections, of reducing Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by 45% below 2005 levels by 2030. Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s conservative coalition won a surprise third term with a commitment to reduce emissions by a more modest 26% to 28% in the same time frame.\n\nMorrison is in the U.S. for a state dinner with President Donald Trump on Friday and has been criticized for failing to include in his New York itinerary the U.N. climate summit on Monday, when leaders will present their long-term plans for curbing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nGovernment lawmaker Craig Kelly on Thursday told students who planned to join Friday\u2019s climate strike that \u201cyou are being used and manipulated and everything you are told is a lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe facts are, there is no link between climate change and drought; polar bears are increasing in number,\u201d Kelly told Parliament.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s generation is safer from extreme weather than at any time in human history,\u201d he added.\n\nSome companies are encouraging their employees to join the climate strike.\n\nAustralian Council of Trade Unions, which represents labor unions, said it supported employees taking time off work to protest.\n\nThe council said in a statement that it \u201cmust take a stand for our future when our government will not.\u201d", "description": "Thousands of protesters gathered Friday at rallies around Australia as a day of worldwide demonstrations calling for action to guard against climate change...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR700_protes_ZG_20190919231309.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
