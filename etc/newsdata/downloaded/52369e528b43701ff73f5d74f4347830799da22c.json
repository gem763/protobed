In the poorest countries, he says, children could be at substantially greater risk of death.\n\nFor instance, say a two-year-old girl comes down with a particularly nasty case of flu \u2013 complete with a bout of pneumonia \u2014 but survives. In the process, her immune system learns how to produce antibodies against that particular virus. The next time the girl comes in contact with it, those antibodies would recognize the pathogen and quash it immediately.\n\nBut then imagine that, at age four, that same girl comes down with a case of measles that erases her immune system's record of how to produce antibodies against the flu strain she previously contracted. So if she encounters that particular flu virus again, she's back to square one \u2013 likely to come down with pneumonia all over again.\n\nAnd just because she managed to survive the first time doesn't mean she'll survive again, adds Mina: \"Every time we don't die from an infection we can basically think of it as, we got lucky.\" So by subjecting a child to the same infection a second time, \"measles is basically making you play the lottery again.\"\n\nOf course, in wealthier countries, children are far less likely to die of infections because they have access to better health care. But, says Mina, they're still subjected to other downsides, such as taking antibiotics that can trigger an adverse reaction or mess with the balance of bacteria in their gut.\n\nAlso, as more and more children lose immunity to diseases they fought off at a young age, those diseases could start raging through the wider population \u2014 not just children but the elderly and adults would be at risk. \"We could see an increase in the transmission of all these pathogens that shouldn't be spreading past a certain age because normally kids are immune,\" says Mina.\n\nMina is careful to note that the notion that measles produces immune amnesia is still a hypothesis.\n\n\"But it's a hypothesis with really good data,\" he says.\n\nFor instance, back in the early 1960s, when the measles vaccine was first introduced on a mass scale in many countries, scientists observed that shortly afterward there was a massive drop in childhood deaths from not just measles but many other infections.\n\nBut it wasn't until 2015 that Mina and his collaborators were able to do a comprehensive statistical analysis of data reaching back to the 1940s. They found spikes in deaths from other childhood infections were directly predicted by measles outbreaks. And the effect lasted two to three years beyond the measles outbreak.\n\nSince the publication of that finding \u2014 in the journal Science \u2014 researchers have found additional evidence for the immune amnesia hypothesis.\n\nIn 2018 a team led by Rik L. de Swart of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, Netherlands, found that children infected with measles in the United Kingdom were significantly more likely to suffer other infections requiring prescription of antibiotics in the two to five years following the measles infection.\n\nMeanwhile, after decades of decline, measles cases have risen precipitously in recent years \u2014 due to a combination of hesitancy by parents in wealthier countries to vaccinate their children and a breakdown in the health infrastructure in less well-off nations. There have been massive outbreaks often involving tens of thousands of children in Brazil, India, the Philippines and Ukraine.\n\nLast month the World Health Organization announced that four European countries \u2013 Albania, the Czech Republic, Greece and the U.K. \u2013 had all lost their previous measles-free status due to local outbreaks. This spring the number of cases in the United States topped 1,000 for the first time in more than two-and-half decades. And globally the total number of cases rose by 300 percent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.\n\nMina says if the immune amnesia hypothesis is correct, it's only a matter of time before the recent surge in measles infections produces a concurrent surge in other diseases. But he's urging public health officials not to wait to find out: If someone has been infected with measles, he says, \"I think we should consider giving them all their childhood vaccines all over again.\"", "description": "There's mounting evidence that the measles virus can erase our immunity to everything from influenza viruses to diarrheal disease.", "authors": ["Nurith Aizenman"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/05/gettyimages-481681421_wide-d2b8736779b6a9fe63ac9321429666267e454263.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
