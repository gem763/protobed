REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng/File Photo\n\nKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia said on Tuesday it would expand tax incentives for companies that use the country as a base for conducting their regional or global business.\n\nEffective this year, companies eligible for the government\u2019s Principal Hub (PH) incentive will be able to enjoy a 10% tax rate for their operations instead of the wider corporate tax rate of 24%, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) said.\n\nEarlier companies eligible for the PH incentive could opt for the 10% tax rate only on income over and above the money they made the year before joining the programme, according to a MIDA official.\n\nCompanies that have yet to establish a presence in Malaysia can apply for tax rates of 0% and 5% for 10 years based on their investments and job-creation commitments. Previously the tax rates for such companies were 0%, 5% and 10%.\n\n\u201cThis enhancement of the PH tax incentive is timely as Malaysia continues to innovate its policies and strategies to attract investments so that the country will be strongly integrated into the region as well as other markets,\u201d MIDA said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe review aims to make Malaysia competitive with other countries in the region as the optimal headquarters hub in Asia Pacific.\u201d\n\nIt said the PH incentive, first introduced in 2015, had helped Malaysia attract local and multinational companies to establish their hubs in the country.\n\nAlong with Vietnam and Thailand, Malaysia has been one of the main beneficiaries of companies trying to move some of their production out of China to escape higher U.S. tariffs.", "description": "Malaysia said on Tuesday it would expand tax incentives for companies that use the country as a base for conducting their regional or global business.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438368586&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970GH", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
