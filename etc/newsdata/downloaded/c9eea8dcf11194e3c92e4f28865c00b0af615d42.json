When a predator tries to take a bite out of the Geckolepis megalepis, the gecko's skin will slide off, leaving its pursuer with a mouthful of scales.\n\nIf you think this sounds gruesome, you don\u2019t know the half of it. The G. megalepis is thought to have the largest body scales of any gecko, which means that even a minor scuffle can result in a major loss of armour. Fortunately for the weird-looking critters, otherwise known as a fish-scale geckos, their bodies can regrow lost scales in a matter of weeks.\n\nVideo of Why Can We Regrow A Liver (But Not A Limb)?\n\n\u201cThis regeneration is, as far as we have been able to tell, scarless, and the resulting regenerated scales are indistinguishable from original ones,\u201d said Mark Scherz, a herpetologist (someone who specialises in the study of reptiles and amphibians) at the Bavarian State Collection for Zoology in Munich. \u201cThat is not the case of many other geckos, in which the regenerated scales have a distinctly different appearance to the original ones.\u201d\n\nThe exceptional size of the scales, which makes the lizard look as if it\u2019s covered in pinkie fingernails, may contribute to the ease of their removal. Larger scales mean more surface area to get caught on claws and teeth, after all. But it\u2019s also more than that.\n\nLesson plan: Two-headed flatworms (regeneration in simple animals)\n\nScherz said the deeper layers of the gecko\u2019s skin contain a special kind of cell called myofibroblasts that seem to be able to contract on contact. This loosens the uppermost layers of skin, allowing the scales to flake off easily. Their skin, in other words, is built to be torn away. The geckos don\u2019t even bleed when they lose their scales. \u201cIt is reasonable to infer that this is a good escape strategy, or else it is unlikely to have evolved,\u201d Scherz said.\n\nScientists have only ever seen this defence mechanism in the wild once \u2013 when a larger, nocturnal gecko tried to turn G. megalepis into dinner. After a battle that lasted just 30 seconds, the G. megalepis shed off some of its armour like you would a robe, and then high-tailed it out of the fray.\n\nA \u201cfish-scale gecko\" photographed after having shed its skin and scales.

While the scientists want to study these critters with as little human disturbance as possible, this is easier said than done \u2013 it is impossible to touch the animal skin without it falling apart like a Christmas tree that\u2019s been left up a few weeks too long.\n\nTo solve the problem, the researchers looked at preserved G. megalepis specimens using micro-CT scanners. This allowed them to examine the animal\u2019s skeleton, which thankfully is a lot less fragile.", "description": "When something tries to take a bite out of a Geckolepis megalepis, all they get is a mouth full of scales.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/gecko.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
