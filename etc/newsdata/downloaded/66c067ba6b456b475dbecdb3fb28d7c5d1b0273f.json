I should have understood that then,\u201d he said. Standing in a small park, Mr. Trudeau appeared in rolled up shirtsleeves as he addressed the controversy that has consumed his campaign for the past 24 hours.\n\n\u201cThe layers of privilege that I have\u201d from growing up wealthy, white and famous, kept him from seeing the pain he caused, Mr. Trudeau added as a few people gathered in the park applauded.\n\nAdmitting he had let his own supporters down, Mr. Trudeau added, \u201cI stand here today to reflect on that and ask for forgiveness.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a spectacular comeuppance for the 47-year-old prime minister, the son of another glamorous Canadian prime minister who came to power four years ago with a \u201cwoke\u201d reputation as an outspoken champion of gender equality, minority rights and liberal values. It\u2019s also a spectacularly bad two-day stretch for Mr. Trudeau as he enters what was already a difficult election campaign against the energized Conservative Party opposition.\n\nConservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, who is running even with Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party in the most recent polls, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the first pictures, but he was even more concerned by Mr. Trudeau\u2019s \u201clie\u201d that there were no other incidents of racial mockery.\n\nThis week\u2019s revelations show Mr. Trudeau \u201chas one set of rules for himself and one set of rules for the rest of us,\u201d Mr. Scheer said.\n\nMr. Trudeau\u2019s fellow Liberals condemned the racist images, but there was no immediate sign they were abandoning their standard-bearer, who led them back to power in 2015 after a decade of Conservative Party government.\n\nMitzie Hunter, a Liberal who is running to lead the party in Ontario and is black, tweeted: \u201cI know it is not representative of the man he is. This is a teachable moment for all of us. I accept his apology and I hope Canadians do, too.\u201d\n\nRacial parody\n\nOn Wednesday, images of a 29-year-old Mr. Trudeau dressed as a Disney version of Aladdin \u2014 in a turban and dark-brown face makeup \u2014 were splashed across the international media. At the time, Mr. Trudeau was a drama teacher at a private school in Vancouver and he costumed himself for an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d-themed fundraiser.\n\nMr. Trudeau apologized and said that was his only time indulging in racial parody. But the next day, a video was released showing him in a high school talent show wearing blackface and singing the Caribbean song \u201cDay O.\u201d\n\nJagmeet Singh leads Canada\u2019s left-wing New Democratic Party. The son of immigrants from the Punjab state of India, Mr. Singh said the pictures of Mr. Trudeau in racial makeup hurt a lot of Canadians.\n\nMany people, Mr. Singh noted, have been treated differently, faced insults and physical violence because of the way they look.\n\n\u201cAnd then to see the prime minister making light of that,\u201d he added. \u201cHow would someone feel living in this country? I can tell you that it hurts.\u201d\n\nMr. Singh added he doesn\u2019t know if he can look at Mr. Trudeau \u201cin the eye\u201d when the leaders meet for their first televised debates next month ahead of the Oct. 21 vote.\n\nPollster Joseph Angolano, vice president of Public Opinion and Analytics at Toronto\u2019s Mainstreet Research, said Thursday that Mr. Trudeau faces a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d in the fallout from this week\u2019s disclosures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time a Canadian leader has been accused \u2014 on the national and international stage \u2014 of racism, and it\u2019s happening to a leader who is known as a champion of progressive values. It\u2019s surreal,\u201d said Mr. Angolano.\n\nThis scandal hurts the Liberal Party leader because it reminds people of \u201cthe other side of Justin Trudeau \u2014 the one who says he\u2019s a feminist and supports aboriginal rights, but when his authority was challenged by the two most powerful women in his cabinet\u201d \u2014 including the first aboriginal woman to be justice minister \u2014 he fired them, Dr. Angolano added, referring to the scandal over alleged favoritism for a major Quebec engineering firm that shook Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government earlier this year.\n\nBut Renu Mehta, CEO of ImagebuilderZ Public Relations in Toronto, said it was unlikely the images taken nearly two decades ago would make a significant dent in Mr. Trudeau\u2019s political support.\n\nDespite Mr. Trudeau\u2019s evident contrition, what he did was \u201cin no way racist,\u201d Ms. Mehta argued. \u201cHe\u2019s not making fun of anyone. It\u2019s just a talent show. We all do these things when we\u2019re growing up.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam faced a media firestorm and calls to resign earlier this year when photos from an old medical school yearbook appeared to show him in blackface. Mr. Northam weathered the controversy, but did not have to face the voters barely a month after the scandal broke.\n\nNik Nanos, president of Ottawa-based Nanos Research, said this is damaging to Mr. Trudeau\u2019s brand but it\u2019s unclear whether it will change votes.\n\nCanadians need a reason to vote for someone, and while this scandal could damage Mr. Trudeau\u2019s personal reputation, it\u2019s not a reason for Liberal voters to defect to the conservative opposition, pollsters say.\n\nIf the opposition can keep this issue alive it could hurt Mr. Trudeau at the polls, Mr. Angolano said. But if Canadians accept his apology as sincere then Mr. Trudeau might even pick up some sympathy votes if the attacks are seen as political.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
