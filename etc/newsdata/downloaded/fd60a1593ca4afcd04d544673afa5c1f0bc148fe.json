Researchers pinpoint one type \u2014 Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli \u2014 as one that is particularly difficult to treat.\n\n\u201cRather \u2014 and unpalatably \u2014 the likeliest route of transmission for ESBL-E.coli is directly from human to human, with fecal particles from one person reaching the mouth of another,\u201d said University of East Anglia professor David Livermore, whose study is published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal.\n\nESBL-E. coli live in the intestines of humans and animals, much of which is harmless. However, some strains can cause symptoms of food poisoning such as diarrhea and vomiting, urinary tract infections and, more concerning, blood infections.\n\nLivermore and his colleagues in the UK tested samples of beef, pork and chicken and analyzed those results against samples of human feces, sewerage and blood. They discovered that strains between the human samples were similar, but different from those found in animals.\n\nThey say this indicates there is \u201clittle crossover\u201d of ESBL-E. coli between humans and animals, said Livermore, meaning it\u2019s being spread primarily between humans.\n\nOREGON TEEN DIES OF BACTERIAL MENINGITIS: REPORT\n\n\u201cHere \u2014 in the case of ESBL-E.coli \u2014 it\u2019s much more important to wash your hands after going to the toilet,\u201d said Livermore, adding that appropriately cooking meat remains critical to avoiding food-borne illness.\n\nThough many varieties of ESBL won\u2019t make you sick, the ones that do are proliferating.\n\n\u201cInfections caused by ESBL-E. coli bacteria are difficult to treat. And they are becoming more common in both the community and hospitals,\u201d said Livermore. \u201cMortality rates among people infected with these super-bug strains are double those of people infected with strains that are susceptible to treatment.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, even adults could use a refresher on proper hand-washing techniques, according to a study by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS). In 2017, they surveyed more than 2,000 people and found that 84 percent don\u2019t scrub their hands with soap and water for the recommended minimum of 20 seconds. More disturbingly, 21 percent admitted they do not always wash their hands after leaving the bathroom.\n\nThey warn that failure to perform good hygiene causes more illness, which means more use of antibiotics, leading to an increase in drug-resistant bacteria, also called \u201csuperbugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we can reduce the number of illnesses where antibiotics are needed,\u201d said RPS president Ash Soni, \u201cwe can reduce antibiotic resistance by saving these important medicines for when they are really required.\u201d\n\nClick here to get more from the NYPost.com", "description": "We don\u2019t know who needs to hear this.
