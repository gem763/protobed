For now, consider all the ways the Braves, who lead the series 2-1 with Game 4 on Monday, are better than the 2018 version that looked overmatched against the Dodgers.\n\nAD\n\nMLB playoff bracket and schedule\n\nThose ways all have names, such as the ones listed above. Soroka, O\u2019Day and Swanson were all in the Braves\u2019 organization last fall but were nursing injuries. Duvall was left off the playoff roster after hitting .195 with a .639 on-base-plus-slugging percentage in 2018. Donaldson was signed to a one-year, $23 million contract last November. And Melancon was acquired from the San Francisco Giants at the trade deadline.\n\nAD\n\nAnd there are plenty more 2019 Braves who were somewhere else a year ago: McCann, signed to a one-year, $2 million deal on the same November day that Donaldson signed; veteran lefty Dallas Keuchel, signed this June to a one-year, $13 million deal; and several additional members of the bullpen.\n\nIn fact, it is fair to say no team in these playoffs has remade itself in the past 12 months as extensively as have the Braves, who zoomed from 90 wins last season to 97 in 2019, and who now have the pieces \u2014 constructed around a homegrown core of 2018 NL rookie of the year Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr., all-star second baseman Ozzie Albies and first baseman and perennial all-star first baseman Freddie Freeman, among others \u2014 to stand as a legitimate threat to any team they face this month.\n\nAD\n\nA year ago, the Braves were surprise champions of the NL East but never stood a chance against the Dodgers \u2014 scoring runs in only three of the 36 innings in that series. Nick Markakis was hitting cleanup. (Now it\u2019s Donaldson.) Arodys Vizcaino was closing. (Now it\u2019s Melancon.) And Charlie Culberson was playing shortstop. (Now it\u2019s Swanson.)\n\nAD\n\nIn three games against the Cardinals, the Braves have shown how far they have come. Even in losing Game 1, they presaged Sunday\u2019s rally against Martinez by battering the Cardinals\u2019 closer for three runs in the ninth, on homers by Acu\u00f1a and Freeman, to bring the tying run to the plate after having trailed at one point by four runs. In Game 2, they beat Cardinals right-hander Jack Flaherty, who was simply the NL\u2019s hottest pitcher coming in.\n\nAnd in Game 3, they outlasted Wainwright\u2019s brilliant, vintage performance \u2014 120 pitches across 7\u2154 scoreless innings \u2014 and ambushed Martinez again in the ninth, this time reversing the outcome of the game and putting themselves one win away from a berth in the NL Championship Series.\n\nAD\n\nTo that end, the Braves got some help from the Cardinals, who seemed determined in the late innings to beat themselves, if the Braves refused to do it first.\n\nAD\n\nIn an era of quick-trigger hooks, bullpen supremacy and creative deployment of pitchers \u2014 all of which get ratcheted up in October \u2014 Cardinals Manager Mike Shildt left Wainwright in, in the eighth inning of a one-run game, after Swanson\u2019s sharp, one-out single put the tying run on base. He left Wainwright in after the next batter, Duvall, lined out to third. He left him in after Wainwright missed with a 3-2 curveball to walk Acu\u00f1a and put the go-ahead run on base, with his pitch count now up to 115.\n\nFinally, after Wainwright walked Albies on five pitches to load the bases, Shildt came out to pull him, and Wainwright \u2014 who was a rookie closer on the 2006 Cardinals team that won the World Series \u2014 walked off to an emotional, standing ovation.\n\nAD\n\nHow to stream the entire MLB postseason\n\nThe Cardinals were bailed out of that self-made mess when lefty Andrew Miller retired Freeman on a flyball to center. But they would not be so fortunate an inning later.\n\nAD\n\nManagers have been known in recent Octobers, including this one, to hatch all sorts of creative plans for patching up a leaky bullpen \u2014 from inserting starters in relief roles on their between-starts \u201cthrow\u201d days to shaking up standard roles to get the preferred matchups. In October, starters don\u2019t always start, closers don\u2019t always close, and all pitchers are evaluated by how many outs they have in them on a given day \u2014 not when they might feel most comfortable pitching.\n\nBut in Sunday\u2019s ninth inning, to protect a one-run lead, here came Martinez, in the classic, time-honored spot for the closer. There was no Plan B. The inning would belong to the 28-year-old right-hander. And for the Cardinals, the inning turned \u2014 in the wrong direction \u2014 on the two-out intentional walk to McCann, which came just after Shildt made a trip to the mound to discuss the options. There appeared to be no disagreements.\n\nAD\n\nWas it the right move? McCann is a left-handed hitter who crushes right-handers. Martinez\u2019s wipeout slider is much more effective against right-handed hitters. Swanson is a right-handed hitter.\n\nAD\n\nBut that strict adherence to matchup mathematics failed to account for one critical factor: Swanson had been having some of the Braves\u2019 best at-bats all day, with a double and a single off Wainwright, both of them solidly struck. Even in a fifth-inning strikeout, he had taken good swings and fouled off a tough 2-2 curveball from Wainwright before whiffing.\n\nPerhaps it was pinch runner Billy Hamilton\u2019s steal of third two batters earlier that made Martinez \u2014 now wary of burying a slider in the dirt that might allow Hamilton to score the tying run \u2014 throw a first-pitch slider close to the center of the plate. Swanson slammed it to left for an RBI double, and the Braves\u2019 series-altering rally was underway.\n\nAD\n\nOh, right. Billy Hamilton, August waiver claim from the Kansas City Royals \u2014 another guy who wasn\u2019t with the Braves a year ago or even three months ago. Another reason these Braves are unrecognizable, in both personnel and ceiling, from the one that wilted on this stage last October.\n\nRead more:\n\nA former Uber driver drew an ALDS start in Yankee Stadium.
