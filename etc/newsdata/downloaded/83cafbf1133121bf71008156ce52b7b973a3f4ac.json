REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko\n\nA former comedian and actor, Zelenskiy swept to power casting himself as a political outsider who would clean up Ukrainian politics and bring in new faces, but he has faced scrutiny over his appointments since taking office in May.\n\nAlexander Rodnyansky, an economist at Britain\u2019s Cambridge University, had already been part of a team of advisers and worked on Zelenskiy\u2019s economic programme after he was elected this year.\n\nBut government sources said he had been promoted to chief economic adviser and the appointment was confirmed in a written statement to Reuters from the state secretary of the cabinet of ministers, Volodymyr Bondarenko.\n\nRodnyansky, 34, acknowledged his name could attract unwanted attention to his appointment.\n\n\u201cI was told by people working in the president\u2019s office that my surname was a risk factor. My surname could be a scandal in and of itself. I was told this even before I had decided whether I want to join (the government) or not,\u201d Rodnyansky said by telephone.\n\nIt is not clear why his appointment, which could give him a lot of influence over economic policy, has not been announced.\n\nSince he rose to power, Zelenskiy has appointed a chief of staff who was the lawyer of a tycoon, Ihor Kolomoisky, whose business ties to Zelenskiy have coloured investors\u2019 views on Ukraine. He has also appointed several friends and business associates to positions in government, but he has denied accusations of nepotism.\n\nRodnyansky\u2019s father, also called Alexander, founded the 1+1 television channel that screened hit comedy shows by Zelenskiy\u2019s production company Kvartal 95 and helped make the future president a household name.\n\nRodnyansky senior, whose films include the 2014 drama Leviathan which won a Golden Globe, is now based in Russia, which backs separatists waging an uprising in east Ukraine.\n\n1+1 was later acquired by Kolomoisky, and the channel became a platform for Zelenskiy\u2019s election campaign.\n\nAfter leaving Kiev at the age of six, Rodnyansky junior grew up in Germany, studied and worked mainly in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. From 2009 to 2011, he was the Head of Business Development at his father\u2019s film company.\n\nRodnyansky told Reuters he was introduced to Honcharuk in June by Serhiy Shefir, a co-founder of Kvartal 95 who is also the president\u2019s chief assistant.\n\n\u201cThe route to our first meeting (with Honcharuk) was short, because they knew about me through my father,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, you can count the number of Ukrainian professors in Western universities on one hand.\u201d", "description": "The son of a film producer who helped President Volodymyr Zelenskiy become a household name as an actor has been appointed the Ukrainian government's chief economic adviser, a senior government official said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Ilya Zhegulev", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444607388&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1SY", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
