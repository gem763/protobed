Mrs. Clinton, she reports, used the line repeatedly to Democratic audiences she knew would appreciate the sentiment.\n\n\u201cThe Deplorables always got a laugh, over living-room chats in the Hamptons, at dinner parties under the stars on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, over passed hors d\u2019oeuvres in Beverly Hills, and during sunset cocktails in Silicon Valley,\u201d wrote Ms. Chozick. The unspoken corollary is that only a morally debased citizenry could have freely chosen Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton.\n\nToday few publicly call Trump voters \u201cdeplorable.\u201d But the assumption remains. Remember that high-school kid from Covington, Ky., who was accosted by a Native American activist? Simply because he was wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, the 16-year-old was instantly transformed into the face of white supremacy by a good part of the American media.", "description": "", "authors": ["William Mcgurn", "Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
