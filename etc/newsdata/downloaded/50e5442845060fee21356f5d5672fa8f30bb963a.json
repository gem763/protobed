So barring an accident or some unlikely mishap, Sunday\u2019s arrival to Madrid will be a relaxed jaunt for Roglic and his yellow-clad Jumbo-Visma teammates to celebrate the title.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I don\u2019t think I was ever imagining this, but I think I will need a few days to understand it,\u201d Pogacar, who rides for UAE Team Emirates, said. \u201cI felt good on the long last climb. I chose the right moment and went full gas to the finish.\u201d\n\nRoglic showed his promise when he was fourth in the 2018 Tour de France and third in the Giro d\u2019Italia in June, where he also won two stages. He has excellent time trialing skills and the ability to also perform well in the toughest mountains.\n\nRoglic took control of the Vuelta and dealt a heavy blow to his rivals on the Stage 10 time trial, where he built an almost two-minute lead over Valverde.\n\nThat proved enough.\n\nDespite the best efforts of Valverde\u2019s Movistar team and Miguel Angel Lopez\u2019s Astana, Roglic defended the red jersey with aplomb through the most grueling mountains in northern Spain.\n\nThat included Saturday\u2019s trek through rain and cold temperatures. Roglic was left alone after the hard pace set by Astana that shed the other Jumbo-Visma riders, but he matched Lopez\u2019s charges and a late push by Valverde.\n\nThe 39-year-old Valverde protected his second place on the podium after racing hard up the final ascent to finish behind Pogacar, who knocked Quintana off the podium in his final race for Movistar.\n\nValverde won the Vuelta in 2009.\n\n\u201cI am very satisfied,\u201d said Valverde, who is 10 years older than Roglic. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream of a second place.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s final stage is a flat 106 kilometers (65 miles) from Fuenlabrada to the Spanish capital.\n\nAssociated Press", "description": "Primoz Roglic is poised to win his first Grand Tour after protecting his comfortable lead of the Vuelta a Espana\u00a0on a rainy and mountainous penultimate stage on Saturday.
