Jeff Petry scored on a penalty shot, Jonathan Drouin also scored, and Price made 32 saves.\n\nMatthews scored twice for Toronto - his fourth and fifth goals of the season - and Alexander Kerfoot had a goal and two assists for his first three points with Toronto. Trevor Moore added a goal and an assist, William Nylander scored, and Michael Hutchinson stopped 37 shots.\n\nAfter a wild third period that saw Toronto blow a 4-1 lead before tying it at 5, Price robbed Marner on a breakaway in overtime before the Canadiens came close at the other end on a scramble that resulted in a slashing penalty to Tavares that helped save a goal.\n\nThe Leafs managed to kill that one off and Tavares had a chance on another break coming out of the box, but Price snagged his effort with the glove. Domi then hit the crossbar on a 2-on-1 rush to cap a frantic extra session.\n\nToronto appeared to have the game in hand when Nylander made it 4-1 at 5:16 of the third period on a power play, but Montreal scored 11 seconds later when Drouin\u2019s pass in front went in off Leafs defenseman Morgan Rielly.\n\nGallagher made it 4-3 at 6:29 after an icing, banging home a rebound.\n\nKerfoot took an interference penalty with under nine minutes left in regulation that Toronto came close to killing off, but Leafs winger Kasperi Kapanen inexplicably threw his broken stick at Petry after blocking a shot when the Canadiens defenseman had the puck at the point.\n\nPetry was awarded a penalty shot as a result, and he beat Hutchinson glove-side to tie it at 13:02. Danault put Montreal ahead by banging a rebound home with 4:40 left. But Matthews tied it 1:15 to go and Hutchinson on the bench for an extra attacker.\n\nNOTES: The 22-year-old Matthews has 12 goals in 12 career games against Montreal. \u2026The Leafs came in off Friday\u2019s 4-1 road victory in Columbus following their 5-3 victory over Ottawa in the opener. The Canadiens dropped their season opener 4-3 to the Carolina Hurricanes in a shootout Thursday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCanadiens: At Buffalo on Wednesday night.\n\nMaple Leafs: Host St. Louis on Monday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Paul Byron scored in a shootout and the Montreal Canadiens overcame a three-goal deficit to beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-5 on Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/canadiens_maple_leafs_hockey_07248_c0-203-4943-3085_s1770x1032.jpg?d22541942390108986a809dc99e9097853a03809", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
