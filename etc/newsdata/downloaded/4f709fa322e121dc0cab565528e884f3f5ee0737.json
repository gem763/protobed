Under this system, banks would not be able to purchase giant blocks of stock, which they typically parcel out to clients at a single price.\n\nThe report also said Gurley cited research by Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida, who found that startups were usually significantly underpriced in IPOs underwritten by Wall Street firms.\n\nThe Silicon Valley investors and executives are holding the summit after a series of disappointing IPOs and IPO filings, highlighted by the aborted offering from WeWork.\n\nThe flexible-office-space company shelved its IPO amid growing concerns about its financials, its strategy, and the ability of then-CEO Adam Neumann to lead the company.\n\nOther startups that recently went public also had disappointing debuts. Peloton, the connected-fitness company, saw its shares slide 11% on its first day of trading last week.\n\nShares of the ride-hailing giant Uber slipped more than 7% when it went public in May and have shed about 30% since then. Shares of its rival Lyft have fallen more than 40% since the company went public in April.\n\nGot a tip about a tech company?
