They shouldn't have to endure project delays because this tired third-term Government can\u2019t fund and run its own environment department properly.\n\n\"With scientists saying 17 more Aussie species are likely to become extinct in the next 20 years, and many more having been listed as threatened, the Morrison Government needs to get its act together.\"", "description": "A review of national environmental laws will focus on the time it takes for major projects to be assessed, amid business complaints \"green tape\" is strangling approval processes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3054%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_440%2C$y_64/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e5a7be35420b2a0d04a4ab5515b83eac0b386548", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
