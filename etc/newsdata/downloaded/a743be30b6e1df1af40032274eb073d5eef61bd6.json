California\u2019s top elected officials said the president was serving the interests of big oil companies and vowed to challenge the administration in court.\n\nThe latest jousting came as federal regulators are working on new federal tailpipe-emission rules that could ease requirements set under the Obama administration in 2012. In a series of Twitter posts, Mr. Trump said the uniformity will create jobs and safer cars.\n\nCalifornia has long had the authority to set its own rules on limiting air pollutants from cars, but the Trump administration believes such requirements should be set by the federal government. The White House first proposed the revocation last year.\n\nRescinding the waiver would curb California\u2019s influence over the car industry. Earlier this year, Ford Motor Co. and several other major auto makers agreed to tougher emission requirements than those set by the Trump administration, giving them more certainty than other paths that were likely to result in prolonged legal battles.\n\n\u201cAuto makers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. The president was tweeting while in California for a series of fundraisers in Palo Alto, Beverly Hills and San Diego.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s announcement drew quick backlash from California leaders. In a press conference alongside the governor and attorney general, Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board, said the state would sue the Trump administration to protect what officials believe to be their right to maintain the waiver.\n\n\u201cWe will be in court as soon as we have a document actually out there, maybe even ahead of that,\u201d Ms. Nichols told reporters in Sacramento.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said the Trump administration was looking to serve the needs of oil companies and that state officials have fought similar battles with former presidents over its federal waivers.\n\n\u201cSince the day he got into office, we\u2019ve been anticipating this move,\u201d Mr. Newsom said of Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets Wednesday.\n\nThe state\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said the state\u2019s expertise and concerns over air pollution \u201care among the reasons why Congress granted our state the authority to combat our air pollution by setting our own standards for vehicle emissions way back.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s actions also drew scrutiny from progressive nonprofits. Public Citizen, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group, said the move \u201cwill further impede efforts to combat global climate change even as the signs of impending climate disaster grow ever clearer.\u201d\n\nThe fight over California\u2019s emissions waiver is the latest in the state\u2019s ongoing battle with the Trump administration on a range of issues from immigration to climate change. The administration and California have also butted heads just this week over the state\u2019s ongoing housing crisis, with the Trump administration considering a plan to erect centers to house California\u2019s many homeless residents.\n\n\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus and Ben Foldy contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech Ferek at katherine.stech@wsj.com and Alejandro Lazo at alejandro.lazo@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump said the administration is revoking California\u2019s authority to set its own tailpipe-emissions standards, escalating a fight that has challenged the auto industry.", "authors": ["Katy Stech Ferek In Washington", "Alejandro Lazo In San Francisco", "Katy Stech Ferek", "Alejandro Lazo", "Katy.Stech Wsj.Com", "Alejandro.Lazo Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108232/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
