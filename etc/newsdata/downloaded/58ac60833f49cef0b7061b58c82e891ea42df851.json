What you're seeing at the moment \u2060\u2014 and we're seeing it in our client base \u2060\u2014 is almost an investor strike.\"\n\nThe chairman of Switzerland's largest bank is seeing what he calls an investor strike as the confusion and uncertainty surrounding Britain's exit from the EU intensifies.\n\nS&P Global Ratings calculated in the spring that Brexit had, by last April, cost the U.K. economy $86 billion. The uncertainty following the vote led to a dramatic decrease in the value of the pound, increased inflation, a fall in household spending power, weak exports, declining real estate prices and the stalling of local and foreign investment.\n\nIn the latest developments, Britain has requested yet another extension of the Oct. 31 deadline to leave the European Union \u2014 which would be the third extension since the June 2016 referendum \u2014 after U.K. lawmakers delayed a vote Saturday on the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nThe lawmakers voted to activate a law that required Downing Street to ask Brussels to push back the deadline for Brexit, despite Johnson's vocal objection to another extension.\n\nBut EU leaders don't have to accept the extension request, and there are a number of ways they could respond. They could offer a technical extension of a few weeks in the hope of passing the recently-negotiated agreement with Johnson; they could agree to push the date back to January 31, opening the door to a U.K. general election and a potential second referendum; or they could refuse the extension request altogether, possibly triggering an economic crisis for both the U.K. and EU.\n\nEU Council President Donald Tusk said he received the extension letter and that he would begin consulting with EU leaders on how to respond to Britain's request. Meanwhile, Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said Sunday morning that the U.K. would indeed leave the EU by October 31, adding yet more confusion to the outlook.\n\nDespite all this, Weber is \"more positive that we'll see an orderly Brexit,\" he told CNBC Saturday. \"But investors still want to see it on the table. They have been, too many times the project has been delayed, and they're just holding out and waiting for investment. And you can see how investment in the U.K. has fallen off a cliff, and that is not good as a dynamic part of the economy.\"\n\n\"So where I see a big risk is a kind of broad-based investment strike at the moment, about the uncertainty that we have in the global economy, which is politically made rather than made by markets. And that is a really bad environment.\"\n\n\u2014CNBC's Spencer Kimball and Matt Clinch contributed to this report.", "description": "\"You can see how investment in the UK has fallen off a cliff, and that is not good as a dynamic part of the economy,\" UBS Chairman Axel Weber told CNBC.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103683013-GettyImages-533939848.jpg?v=1555042966", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
