Upon returning, the constable fired five shots and injured the 28-year-old male,\" he said.\n\nThe injured man was taken to the clinic, where he was certified dead.\n\n\"The constable disappeared from the scene and he is still being sought for his actions,\" said Seisa.\n\nIpid's investigation was ongoing.\n\nSeisa said they were concerned by the conduct of police officials, especially while off-duty.\n\n\"Some of them have a tendency of visiting public entertainment areas and /or liquor outlets whilst having access to the firearms. This should not be the case or practice as the firearm legislation is clear on how to manage and handle all firearms.\"", "description": "A KwaZulu-Natal policeman is being sought after he allegedly gunned down a man during an argument in the early hours of Sunday morning.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9419/82bd6770bcd34151b3b1eae0e16cbda3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
