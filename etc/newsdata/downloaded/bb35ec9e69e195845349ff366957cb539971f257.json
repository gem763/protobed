This season, the Italian league is reverting to its traditional holiday break with no games between Christmas and New Year's Day.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "A Napoli 'ultra' fan has been arrested and accused of killing the Inter Milan supporter who died following clashes outside the San Siro ahead of a Serie A match last December", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
