How dare you. You\u2019re about to be fired. You\u2019re fucking history,\u201d he shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me \u2019cause I\u2019m pissed off \u2019cause I didn\u2019t get a simple thing that I need right now here in California, where I\u2019m here less than 24 hours, you gotta be fucking kidding me, you spoilt brat!\u201d\n\nThe message forms part of the evidence being drawn up by Robinson, who filed a lawsuit in a New York federal court this week against De Niro, alleging he engaged in gender discrimination, harassment, workplace retaliation, verbal abuse, and even unwanted physical conduct.\n\nIn her complaint, Robinson claims De Niro repeatedly unloaded aggressive rants against her and at least one other female business partner, which included calling her a \u201cbitch\u201d and a \u201cbrat\u201d while calling another woman a \u201ccunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cMs. Robinson\u2019s position became increasingly intolerable, and over the years she announced her intent to resign multiple times,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cDe Niro responded with both a carrot and a stick \u2013 he made promises to induce to her stay and threatened repercussions if she left.\u201d\n\n\u201cDe Niro also stood idly by while his friend slapped Ms. Robinson on her buttocks,\u201d it continues. \u201cHe does not accept the idea that men should treat women as equals. He does not care that gender discrimination in the workplace violates the law. Ms. Robinson is a casualty of this attitude.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is also a retaliation against De Niro, who filed his own $6 million lawsuit against Robinson back in August over her conduct as vice president of production and finance of his company Canal Productions.\n\nIn his complaint, De Niro alleges she misused corporate credit cards and binge-watched Netflix series while on the job, claims Robinson says have permanently damaged her reputation.\n\n\u201cThe results have been devasting to Ms. Robinson. Her reputation and her career have been destroyed,\u201d the suit states.\n\nAlthough such claims remain untested in a court of law, De Niro has become infamous for his foul mouth and aggressive attitude. His most regular target is President Donald Trump, who he has denounced as a \u201cmean-spirited, soulless, amoral, abusive con-artist son of a bitch,\u201d while also expressing a desire to \u201cpunch him in the face.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Actor and far-left activist Robert De Niro can be heard exploding on his former personal assistant, Graham Chase Robinson.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Robert-De-Niro-Getty-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
