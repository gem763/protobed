For example, the origin of the Steele Dossier is troubling and worth investigating. The Carter Page FISA applications should also be closely examined. It is not at all uncommon (sadly) for to find examples of overreach or abuse in any far-flung and complex investigation \u2014 that\u2019s one reason why defense lawyers often spend so much time on suppression motions before trials. But the theories floating around online Trumpworld go far, far beyond any discernible connection to logic or evidence.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem \u2014 the wildest theories are floated in the quarters that are most fiercely devoted to the president. They\u2019re the ones who constantly to refer to the \u201creal collusion\u201d as the connection between Democrats and the Ukrainian government. They\u2019re the ones who cast doubt on the very idea that Russia interfered in the election at all, much less on Trump\u2019s behalf. They\u2019re the ones constantly using absurd words like \u201ccoup\u201d to describe constitutional and legal processes that are adverse to Trump. And, based on the transcript of the call with Volodymyr Zelensky, it seems as if Trump is drinking deeply of their conspiratorial Kool-Aid.\n\nIn their click-bait zeal to curry favor with the world\u2019s most powerful man, they are feeding Trump\u2019s worst instincts, and now we know that he\u2019s warped American diplomacy in one of the world\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods as a result.", "description": "", "authors": ["David French", "Nationalreview.Com Corner Trump-Most-Loyal-Allies-Are-Putting-Him-On-Path-To-Impeachment"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
