Mark Meadows of North Carolina nodded in response\n\nTrump blasted the 'spy' at an event where he signed an executive order on 'transparency'\n\n'But who's the person giving this information? If that person exists -- I'm not sure that person exists, but I think it\u2019s important.'\n\nThen he turned to Freedom Caucus head Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who was standing behind him at an event. 'And I say this to Congress. I think it's important to find out who that person is. Because we could have a spy. I don't want spies,' Trump said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if he meant a U.S. official had actually engaged in espionage for a foreign power, or he was referring to properly credentialed people listening in on the call. The New York Times reported that a second whistle-blower also complained about the 'crazy' phone call after it happened.\n\nIn remarks to UN workers last month soon after he ordered the release of the transcript of his call Trump raised the spy allegation in remarks caught on video.\n\nTrump said: 'I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistle-blower the information? Because that's close to a spy.' He continued: 'You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now,' he said, referencing execution.\n\nHouse Intelligence chairman Rep. Adam Schiff has invited the whistle-blower to testify to his committee\n\nTrump's attack came as CBS published what it said was the full report provided by the whistle-blower.\n\nThe whistle-blower reported speaking to a an unnamed White House official for a few minutes after Trump's July 25 call with the Ukrainian president. The official described a call that was \"crazy,\" \"frightening\" and \"completely lacking in substance related to national security,\" according to the report.\n\nThe official was 'visibly shaken by what had transpired and seemed keen to inform a trusted colleague within the U.S. national security apparatus about the call.'\n\nAccording to the whistle-blower's notes: 'The official stated that there was already a conversation underway with White House lawyers about how to handle the discussion because, in the official's view, the President had clearly committed a criminal act by urging a foreign power to investigate a U.S. person for the purposes of advancing his own reelection bid in 2020.'", "description": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday once again put forward the allegation that a person who provided information to a whistle-blower about his own call with the president of Ukraine might be a 'spy.'", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/23/19513694-0-image-a-16_1570660052960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
