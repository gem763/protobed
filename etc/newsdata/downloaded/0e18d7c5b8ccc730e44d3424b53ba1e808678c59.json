But some are raising concerns about one of the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) which will break certain smart contracts. So should technology be backward compatible ad infinitum?\u2026 or is a little disruption necessary in the name of progress?\n\nToo Many EIPs Delay The Upgrade\n\nThe testnet activation of the latest update was originally due to happen on September 4th. However, the date has been pushed back to the start of October due to a large number of EIPs submitted for review. Developers eventually accepted six of these for inclusion in the Istanbul package, with a further eight in the following upgrade.\n\nThe testnet delay means that the mainnet activation will also occur a month later, in November after the DevCon developer conference.\n\nBreaking Ethereum\u2019s Contract\n\nHowever, Parity developer, Wei Tang, has raised concerns about one of the improvement proposals, Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1884. This \u201cwill break at least a few deployed contracts,\u201d he tweeted, continuing that \u201cwhat worries me is that some participants on last AllCoreDevs seem to classify it as acceptable behavior.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to say:\n\nFor software engineering, if you\u2019re developing something that many people depends on, then backward compatibility is one of the top priorities for making any design decisions. This is especially important for blockchain, because a lot of money can be involved.\n\nThe technical details of the compatibility issues can be found on GitHub.\n\nYou Can\u2019t Make An Omelette Without Breaking Eggs\n\nWhile Tang\u2019s concerns may seem valid, there is, of course, a counter-argument that obsessing over backward compatibility is counteractive to progress.\n\nTang makes the example of Microsoft\u2019s Windows gaining popularity because of backward compatibility. Whilst it may have gained popularity in this period, it arguably fell into a technological black-hole.\n\nApple\u2019s insistence on allowing old-tech to fall into obsolescence was (and still is) widely criticized. However, it took Microsoft years and many iterations of Windows before it caught up to the advances of Apple\u2019s OS X, losing backward compatibility on the way.\n\nIf it were purely down to Microsoft, we would likely still be lugging around laptops with legacy VGA and serial ports. Slimline, slimline!\n\nWith concerns as to how much space is left on the Ethereum blockchain, clearly something must be done or technology could die. With stakes that high, surely a few broken contracts are a small price to pay?\n\nWhat do you think about the disputed Ethereum Improvement Proposal?
