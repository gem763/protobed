(STR, AFP)\n\nWildfires in Bolivia have razed more than four million hectares (10 million acres) of forest and grassland since August, an NGO warned, as a state of emergency spread to the country's northeast.\n\nThe fires have torched some of the country's most environmentally sensitive areas for weeks, and the government of the northeastern department of Beni declared a red alert on Wednesday.\n\n\"The area burned in the department of Santa Cruz amounts to three million hectares,\" said the Friends of Nature Foundation (FAN), an environmental non-profit.\n\nThat represents nearly 75% of the total area affected by fires nationwide, which it put at 4.1 million hectares.\n\nThe FAN based its estimate on satellite images from NASA and the European Space Agency, as of September 15.\n\nBeni is the second-worst affected area, with nearly 900 000 hectares destroyed so far by the fires, which continue to rage.\n\nThe regional government declared a state of emergency on Wednesday.\n\nEmergency measures allow the release of resources to deal with the fires, including moving more civil defense personnel to the area.\n\nBolivia has enlisted special firefighting planes, a Supertanker Boeing 747 and a Russian Ilyushin, as well as helicopters, 5 000 firefighters, soldiers and police to help extinguish the fires.\n\nThe eastern department of Santa Cruz has been the hardest hit of Bolivia's nine departments since the fires began in May and intensified in late August.\n\nEnvironmentalists blame laws enacted under leftist President Evo Morales, who has encouraged burning of forest and pasture land to expand agricultural production.\n\nThe government attributes the blazes to dry weather and flame-fanning winds.", "description": "Wildfires in Bolivia have razed more than four million hectares (10 million acres) of forest and grassland since August, an NGO warns, as a state of emergency spread to the country's northeast.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9385/c3a9d02e179045ba8d7ff44286b13add.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
