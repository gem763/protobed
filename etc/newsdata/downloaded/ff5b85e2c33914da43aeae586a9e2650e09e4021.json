Trump denied making any improper requests.\n\nUKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE'\n\n\u201cI said absolutely nothing wrong; it was perfect,\u201d Trump said outside the White House before departing for Houston. \u201cThere was no quid pro quo, there was nothing,\u201d he later added.\n\nTrump did point fingers at Biden, however. The Democratic presidential hopeful\u2019s son Hunter Biden had been investigated related to business interests. Biden has said in the past that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden\u2019s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.\n\nTrump accused Biden of being dishonest in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling the New Yorker that they spoke \u201cjust once\u201d about it.\n\n\u201cAnd now he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,\u201d Trump said Sunday. \u201cOf course you spoke to your son!\u201d\n\nWhen asked about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump said it had nothing to do with the Biden family.\n\n\"Because I want Germany, and I want France, and I want the European Union to put up money,\" Trump said. \"And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid to the best of my knowledge.\"\n\nBIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., doubted that Trump's conversation with Zelenskiy was innocent.\n\n\"Well if that\u2019s the case, then why doesn\u2019t the president simply release the transcript of that call?\u201d Schiff said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Schiff also challenged Trump to allow the release of the whistleblower complaint, accusing Trump of not wanting to see either one.\n\nThe Democratic congressman has long been a vocal critic of the president but has not been among those calling for his impeachment. Schiff said that may change in light of the reports of Trump's conversation with Ukraine.\n\n\"If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit \u2026 then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has acknowledged that he was involved in investigating Hunter Biden, but claimed that his original goal was to investigate ties between Ukraine and Democrats related to the 2016 election. He denied that he was specifically out to get Biden.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to say is I went there on a political mission to get Joe Biden in trouble,\u201d Giuliani told \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d calling such a claim \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said that the suspicion of Biden\u2019s wrongdoing related to his son\u2019s case was \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to what he had already been investigating related to the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cThis is going to get bigger and bigger, and everything I say I can prove,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nTrump said he would be amenable to Giuliani discussing the matter before Congress.\n\n\u201cI would have no problem,\u201d the president said. \u201cRudy\u2019s a straight shooter, and Rudy wants to see the same thing as a lot of other people when it comes to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo also fielded questions about Ukraine on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d but declined to get into specifics, only stating that Trump\u2019s discussions with world leaders \u201chave always been 100 percent appropriate, 100 percent lawful.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "President Trump answered questions Sunday morning regarding reports that a whistleblower complaint may had accused him of wrongdoing related to a July phone call with the Ukrainian president, and insisted that there was \u201cabsolutely nothing wrong\u201d with the substance of the discussion.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Trump092019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
