Are they simply marching, or are they politically engaged more generally? Here\u2019s what I found.\n\nHere\u2019s how I did my research\n\nAD\n\nI collected data from participants at the Climate Strike in Washington, D.C. on Sept. 20. A 13-person research team (including me) snaked through the crowd as they lined up at John Marshall Park before they began marching, sampling every fifth person at designated increments to gather a field approximation of a random sample. In total, we collected data from 193 participants at the event, with a response rate of 79 percent.\n\nAD\n\nWhat we found is consistent with my findings from earlier research on the youth climate movement and on those with experience in what many have called the \u201cresistance\u201d: the broader movement that has been challenging President Trump\u2019s administration and its polices since January 2017. Participants in the Climate Strike were predominantly female. The median age of the crowd was 22 years old. Three-quarters, or 76 percent, of the participants will be eligible to vote in the U.S. 2020 election. And their current levels of civic engagement strongly suggests they will vote.\n\nThe U.N. Climate Summit has limits. But it's not the only game in town.\n\nAs part of this survey, we asked participants the following question: \u201cIf the 2020 election were held today (no matter whether you are eligible to vote), who would you vote for?\u201d Forty-one percent supported Elizabeth Warren, with by far the largest share. Bernie Sanders came in second with 20 percent of the support. Joe Biden was a distant third with 12 percent.\n\nAD\n\nMost participants in the Climate Strike identified as being on the political left, while 9 percent identified as politically moderate. Interestingly, those who identified themselves as \u201cVery Left\u201d on the political spectrum (24 percent of the crowd) also favored Warren (46 percent) over Sanders (33 percent).\n\nAD\n\nThese activists are significantly more engaged in a range of political activities than the general American population: 46 percent reported contacting an elected official in the past year; 46 percent attended a public, town, or school meeting; and 44 percent engaged in consumer activism by boycotting or deliberately buying a certain product for political, ethical, or environmental reasons (\u201cbuycotting\u201d).\n\nWhat Americans really think about California's auto emissions standards -- and what could change their minds.\n\nMany report having been involved with more confrontational forms of political engagement as well. About a third of Climate Strikers, or 32 percent, reported participating in confrontational direct action in the past year.\n\nAD\n\nGiven these levels of civic engagement and political experience, expect these new voices to make themselves heard in the upcoming elections. If the election\u2019s outcome is not what they hoped for, don\u2019t be surprised if there's more climate action in the streets. Based on the direct action we saw during ShutDownDC on Monday and Friday, as well as the other civil disobedience that took place around the U.S. this past week, these climate activists are willing to act.\n\nAD\n\nAnd if peaceful protest and political participation do not work, they still have other options.\n\nDon\u2019t miss anything!
