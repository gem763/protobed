(Graham Isador)\n\nAluna Theatre originally started the Caminos festival as a means of promoting talent from the Latinx diaspora \u2014 but over the past three years, they've expanded the scope of their work after recognizing the lack of opportunities for creators from peripheral communities.\n\nAs the ten-day curated fest plays host to dance, theatre, music and performance art, selected participants are invited to share excerpts from longer work performed with full technical support. The hope is that the excerpts catch the attention of producers who are able to offer funding for full-length runs of the shows. In its short existence the festival has had an extremely impressive track record, with five pieces being picked up for productions \u2014 including Jiv Parasram's Take d Milk, Nah?, which is currently in the midst of a national tour, and Augusto Bitter's CHICHO, which won Outstanding Performance of an Individual at last year's Dora Awards.\n\nThis year, Aluna has partnered with Native Earth Performing Arts in producing the festival. For Aluna Theatre's artistic director Beatriz Pizano, Caminos is serving a much-needed role for the community.\n\n\"It's turned into an amazing thing. We're really interested in intersectionalities and collaboration,\" Pizano tells CBC Arts. \"This year I've been focusing on art that explores our relationship to the land. It's been an obsession in my work lately. We're in a time in the world right now where we're not only seeing environmental disasters but also all of these divisions between people. I feel like now more than ever, art is of the essence. We need to learn how to talk to one another, and the pieces that we chose for this year's festival have a lot to do with that...We're giving space for people to explore those ideas.\"\n\nChristine Quintana \u2014 playwright behind the show Clean, which will have a 20-minute excerpt at this year's fest \u2014 echoes Pizano's comments about the importance of Caminos for creators. \"In mainstream theatre and media, artists from marginalized communities are so often tasked with having to represent their entire community \u2014 and within that, the more mainstream narratives rise to the front,\" says Quintana. \"Caminos brings together an incredibly diverse group of artists within the Latinx community and beyond, which offers a wide range of experiences and expressions of the things we share and the things that make us unique.\"\n\nThis year's fest features 20 performances from artists across the country. Below, we've highlighted some of the shows that we are most excited to see.\n\nBypass.

Equal parts mortifying and hilarious, Bypass is a beautifully candid look at body image, beauty, health and society.\n\nClean. (Courtesy)\n\nWritten by Dora and Jessie award-winning playwright Christine Quintana, Clean is the story of a chance encounter between a Canadian tourist and a Mexican hotel worker. The encounter forces the pair to examine old traumas while also exploring their cultural differences.\n\nMura Buai.

Mura Buai (Everyone Everyone) is a collaboration between Indigenous performers from Torres Strait Islands and across Turtle Island.\n\nAll for One for All.
