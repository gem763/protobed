Change is coming whether we like it or not, by disaster or by design.'\n\nMeanwhile, when Waterston was asked by one reporter beforehand if it was the right move to get arrested to highlight the issue, he replied: 'I have to do something. I don't know. You got a better idea?'\n\nFonda sticks out her tongue as she is arrested during the Fire Drill Friday Climate Change Protest on Friday\n\nFonda says she was inspired to act by climate activists such as Greta Thunberg, from Sweden.

All charges were later dropped. Then, in 1972, the actress visited an anti-aircraft position in North Vietnam (right)\n\nThe first arrest occurred on October 11 and saw Fonda getting led away by herself and not alongside any celebrity friends.\n\nFonda was one of the most public faces in the anti-war movement throughout the years that the United States was in Vietnam, but drew the outrage of many in 1972 when she traveled to Hanoi in North Vietnam.\n\nAfter touring the area and being heavily photographed with the forces that the US were fighting, Fonda publicly attacked her country for bombing farmland and destroying the dyke system which was crucial to feeding much of the population.\n\nThe United States denied ever carrying out such an action. She also supported the Black Panthers and marched for the rights of Native Americans, soldiers and working mothers.\n\nIn 1970, she went to Fort Meade to hand out anti-war pamphlets to soldiers, but was arrested before she was able to.\n\nShe and her then-husband, social and political activist Tom Hayden, were also often pictured at anti-nuclear demonstrations.", "description": "Jane Fonda was awarded BAFTA's Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award but was unable to attend the Los Angeles award show on Friday as she had been detained.", "authors": ["Matthew Wright For Dailymail.Com", "Mary Kekatos For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/16/20219218-0-image-a-12_1572104206764.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
