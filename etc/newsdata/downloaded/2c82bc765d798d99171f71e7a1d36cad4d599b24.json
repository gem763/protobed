I don\u2019t think they can at the moment because they\u2019ve got enough issues going on,\" the ex-defender explained to TalkSport.\n\n\u201cI think they are in such a bad place at the moment it would throw more mud at the club if they were to get rid of Ole.\n\n\u201cIf they could come out and say \u2018we are getting rid of him and we are going to have a clean slate with someone fresh\u2019, in other words Ed Woodward is going to move away from his position and someone else is going to take that position and the club is going to be run as what it should be, a football club, I would say yes.\n\n\u201cWhoever is going to come in next is going to have the same barriers in front of them.\u201d\n\nHaving let the likes of Antonio Valencia, Ander Herrera, Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez go in a summer clearout, Solskjaer has placed faith in United's crop of youngsters so far in 2019-20.\n\nDaniel James, Mason Greenwood, Man Utd\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd while their early performances have been mixed, Parker believes that reflects more on the club's senior players than the young stars themselves.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough men now, who I would come out and say, who have got anything about them to believe they can make something happen,\" he added.\n\n\u201cI keep reading all the time about bringing through these young players, I think to myself, if you were a parent and your son was with Manchester United you would not want him to go on that pitch to make his debut with that team there in this moment in time.\n\n\u201cThere are too many selfish players out there who are more concerned about their own issues than be concerned about looking after a young player out there who is looking to make his name in the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the wrong time to be using these wrong players.\u201d", "description": "While results so far in 2019-20 have been distinctly disappointing, one former Red Devil believes the Norwegian must stay at Old Trafford", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iUnys9UAaWBlsmJY32HAZQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/irh3lRnzbySulj7raQbjEg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/89a1c40355f17fcf7ab047bace413dee", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
