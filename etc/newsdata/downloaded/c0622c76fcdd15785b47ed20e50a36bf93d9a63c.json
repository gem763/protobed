He now weighs a healthy 12st 2lb after ditching his unhealthy habits and has become a personal trainer.\n\nBut equally importantly, Darren has learned to look after his mental wellbeing.\n\nHe\u2019s sharing his story to break down the silence around men\u2019s mental health and inspire others to ask for help when they need it.\n\nAn injury prevented Darren from exercising (Picture: CATERS NEWS)\n\nDarren, from Cwmbran, Wales, said: \u2018My obsessive and compulsive attitude prevented me from seeking medical attention when I first rolled my ankle in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I continued to work out every day, run up to 50 miles of a weekend or cycle 100 miles, but the following year I entered an Ironman triathlon and collapsed as my ankle couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\n\n\u2018I did a good job at breaking it as the three tendons were ruptured, with one also snapping \u2013 doctors advised an operation but there was a risk of minimal movement after.\n\n\u2018I decided to nurse my ankle back to heath on my own, but it wasn\u2019t as easy as I thought it would be.\n\n\u2018I felt completely lost without exercise and that is when the floodgates opened, and I became depressed.\n\nHe became depressed and tried to control his feelings with food and alcohol (Picture: CATERS NEWS)\n\n\u2018I was suffering on the inside when I saw people exercising \u2013 I felt like people thought less of me because I could barely even run to the end of my garden.\n\n\u2018I continued to eat 4,000 calories which I would have burned off before and turned to alcohol for comfort, at first it was a glass of red wine but that led to three bottles per night.\n\n\u2018The weight kept piling on, and it started taking its toll on my family too as I used to be the fun dad who would take my children Sophia, seven and Ieuan, 10, swimming and play with them.\n\n\u2018But I became too embarrassed and couldn\u2019t take my top off as I was ashamed of my body.\u2019\n\nTwo years after his injury, Darren sought counselling from mental health charity Mind, which supported him on his journey to get back on track.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe went on to book himself a sky dive and gave himself the goal of taking part in the UK Ultimate Physique competition. On 19 October he took to the stage and came sixth.\n\n\u2018I realised I was going through a mental breakdown and decided I can\u2019t let myself get any worse,\u2019 said Darren.\n\nThrough exercise and support from Mind, Darren feels healthier than ever (Picture: CATERS NEWS)\n\n\u2018My wife Sarah, 44, who is an accountant, knew it was a decision I had to make for myself and she supported me every step of the way.\n\n\u2018I first booked the sky dive because I knew you had to be 15 stone and I wanted to feel alive again by stepping out of my comfort zone.\n\n\u2018After the sky dive, I had seven months to get into shape for a physique competition and I did it but I was mindful and listened to my body when it needed to rest.\n\n\u2018I have been through a lot but I have become a better person, I have been on the other side but now that I am back \u2013 I want to help people.\n\n\u2018I plan to set up a free boot camp next year for people with mental health problems so they can come and exercise but also talk.\u2019\n\nNeed support?
