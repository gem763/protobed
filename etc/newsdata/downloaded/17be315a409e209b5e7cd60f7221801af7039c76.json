And so, the older \u201cPitbull,\u201d who is the brother to Bellator dual champion Patricio, will try to make it happen with Rizin FF.\n\nOn Saturday at Rizin FF 19, Freire (21-8) will take part in the Japanese promotion\u2019s lightweight grand prix as he meets Tatsuya Kawajiri (37-13-2) in the quarterfinals of the eight-man tournament. It will be Freire\u2019s first fight in eight months as he looks to extend his winning streak to six.\n\nAhead of the start of the tournament, MMA Junkie caught up with Freire. You can check out the Q&A below.\n\n****\n\nCan you talk about being in the Rizin lightweight grand prix?\n\nI\u2019m highly motivated for this fight in Japan, in the Pride FC style. When I became interested in MMA, it wasn\u2019t just because of Royce Gracie, but also because of the great Brazilian combatants in Japan \u2013 Rodrigo Minotauro, Rogerio Minotouro, Mauricio \u2018Shogun\u2019 Rua, and Wanderlei Silva. The Pride era in Japan, with its own rules, was a high point of recognition of Brazilian MMA around the world. It\u2019s a dream to see the massive Japanese crowds and to fight in the land of the samurai. It\u2019s the land where MMA fighters are truly respected and admired.\n\nCan you talk about some of the top fighters in the tournament?\n\nThe fighters in the grand prix are truly tough. Johnny Case walks into the cage with the right strategy and uses his wrestling to dominate his opponents. He uses control and is never in a hurry to get a finish. He\u2019s very intelligent. Tofiq Musayev is highly aggressive and a complete fighter. He\u2019s one of the tougher tournament participants. Tatsuya Kawajiri is a huge name in the organization. Not only is he fighting at home, but he is very well traveled, having fought in several major promotions like the UFC, DREAM, Strikeforce, and Pride. I admire him. I used to watch his fights before my MMA debut. This tournament will be very difficult, and I\u2019m confident that most bouts will be won via small details. The quality of the participants is very high.\n\nTalk about your next opponent.\n\nI\u2019m facing Tatsuya Kawajiri. I had been worried due to the six months of inactivity on my part after I had hand surgery. I was concerned with any post-surgery mobility or pain issues. Thankfully, after daily physical therapy, I\u2019m feeling great. My training has been great, too. I already landed a few knockouts at our academy. I\u2019ve been putting a lot of work into practicing the Rizin rules, such as kicks and stomps to the head of a downed opponent. That way, I can stay smart in case I\u2019m put in a vulnerable situation, or in case I get a chance to do it to my opponent.\n\nDoes \u2018grand prix\u2019 mean there\u2019s a big cash prize at the end?\n\nThere\u2019s no final money prize. Each fight pays its own purse, at least for me. Whoever wins the tournament will be the champion of the weight class. The new champion will then be able to defend his belt next year. I plan to be that champion. I may return to Bellator after that. But I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of myself. I have a very tough Kawajiri in front of me now. He is very experienced and cannot be underestimated. I\u2019m in a great phase in my career, and I wish to continue my winning streak. I\u2019m taking it one step at a time.", "description": "Patricky Freire has yet to capture gold in Bellator but aims to do so in Japan with Rizin FF.", "authors": ["Christian Stein", "John Morgan", "Mike Bohn", "Farah Hannoun", "Dave Doyle", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/patricky-freire-tatsuya-kawajiri-rizin-19-weigh-ins-faceoff-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
