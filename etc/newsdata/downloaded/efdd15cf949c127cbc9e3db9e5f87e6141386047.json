The IOC plan \"puts those who have been working with us on ways to tackle high temperatures in a difficult spot,\" he added.\n\nThe Tokyo 2020 organiser had been trying to find ways to keep athletes and spectators cool during hot weather and at a test marathon event in September, deployed tents equipped with mist machines. Sapporo, Hokkaido's capital, is as much as five to six degrees centigrade cooler than Tokyo in summer where temperatures commonly exceed 30 degrees.\n\nThe last time Tokyo hosted the Olympic games the event opened in October when temperatures are lower.
