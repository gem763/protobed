The whistleblower report last week cited multiple sources, while making clear that its author was not one of the White House officials listening to the call.\n\n2. Chinese party-pooping\n\nChina is getting ready to shut down for a week to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party\u2019s takeover of power. The formal celebrations start on Tuesday.\n\nTo mark the occasion, protesters in Hong Kong stepped up their activities at the weekend, with marches that were marked by violent clashes and Molotov cocktails on the one side and tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon on the other.\n\nAlso over the weekend, U.S. officials played down a report from Friday that the administration was considering limits on U.S. portfolio investment in China \u2013 although there was no full-blooded denial of the report.\n\n3.

Europe springs a labor market surprise\n\nStocks have been helped by a rare positive surprise in European data earlier Monday.\n\nThe seasonally-adjusted jobless rate in the fell to an 11-year low of 7.4% in September, thanks to a big drop in and an even more important 10,000 decline in .\n\nThat allayed fears that the deepening slowdown in manufacturing in Europe\u2019s largest economy would spread to the broader labor market.\n\nNational inflation data from across Europe still came in weaker than expected, however.\n\n5. Errant Johnson pressures sterling\n\nremained under pressure as the governing Conservative Party began its annual conference against a backdrop of growing accusations of impropriety against Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nWeekend reports fleshed out earlier insinuations that Johnson had an affair with a U.S. entrepreneur whose companies received over 110,000 pounds ($137,000) in government grants, while separate reports alleged he sexually assaulted two female journalists at the same lunch 20 years ago.\n\nJohnson denies all the allegations.\n\nIn the background, opposition parties and rebel Tory lawmakers continue to work on their plans for a \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d that would likely call a second referendum on Brexit if and when it topples Johnson\u2019s minority government with a no-confidence vote.", "description": "Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE7G0CO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
