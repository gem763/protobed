The town is about 15km (nine miles) east of London.\n\nThe bodies were discovered by ambulance staff, and the police later said that \"sadly all 39 people inside the container had died\".\n\n\"Early indications suggest that one of these people was a teenager. The rest are believed to be adults,\" the police said.\n\nOn Thursday morning it was confirmed they were all Chinese nationals.\n\nPolice have said formal identification \"could be a lengthy process\".\n\nThe police had earlier suggested that the lorry could be from Bulgaria, but later said they believed the vehicle entered the UK from Belgium.\n\nThe Bulgarian foreign ministry said in a statement: \"The bodies of 38 adults and a teenager have not yet been identified, but police said that it is highly unlikely that they are Bulgarians.\n\nThe Belgian Federal Prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into the incident, focusing on who organised it and any other parties involved.\n\nWhat about the lorry?\n\nEssex police believe the trailer arrived in Purfleet on the River Thames from Zeebrugge, Belgium, at about 00:30 BST on Wednesday (23:30 GMT Tuesday).\n\nOfficials in Belgium are investigating how long the container spent there, before travelling to the UK.\n\nEssex police corrected their earlier statement that said the lorry had entered the UK at Holyhead, a major Irish Sea port in Wales, on 19 October.\n\nThe tractor unit (the front part of the lorry) is thought to have come from Northern Ireland and picked up the trailer from Purfleet, Essex, shortly after 01:05 (00:05 GMT).\n\nIt had stickers on the windscreen saying \"Ireland\" and \"The Ultimate Dream\".\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said investigations would be undertaken to establish if the lorry had passed through Ireland.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"An absolute tragedy and a very sad day for Essex\" \u2013 Pippa Mills from Essex Police\n\nIn the earlier statement, the police had said they believed the lorry was from Bulgaria.\n\nThe Bulgarian foreign ministry said: \"The Scania truck was registered in Varna (on the east coast of Bulgaria) under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen.\"\n\nBulgarian officials were also quoted as saying that the lorry was last in Bulgaria in 2017.\n\nIt was not immediately known where the container originated from.\n\nRichard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said the container appeared to be a refrigerated unit where temperatures could be as low as -25C (-13F).\n\nLater on Wednesday, the lorry was moved to a secure site so the bodies could be \"recovered while preserving the dignity of the victims\", Deputy Chief Constable of Essex Police Pippa Mills said.\n\nAnd the driver?\n\nThe driver was named locally as Mo Robinson, 25, from the Portadown area of County Armagh, Northern Ireland.\n\nImage copyright Facebook Image caption The arrested lorry driver has been named locally as Mo Robinson, from the Portadown area of County Armagh\n\nHe has been arrested on suspicion of murder, and is being questioned by police.\n\nPolice in Northern Ireland have carried out raids on two houses associated with Mr Robinson - one in Markethill, County Armagh, and another in nearby Laurelvale.\n\nWas it an attempt to smuggle people into the UK?\n\nWe do not know at this stage, and Essex police warn that the investigation will be \"lengthy and complex\".\n\nThe National Crime Agency said it is trying to identify any \"organised crime groups who may have played a part\".\n\nThe BBC's home editor Mark Easton reports that people smugglers have increasingly moved to other routes since the Calais migrant camps were shut three years ago in France and security measures were increased at Dover and the Channel Tunnel.\n\nRichard Burnett from the Road Haulage Association told BBC Breakfast that ports at Calais and Coquelles use CO2 monitors, sniffer dogs and scanners to check for trafficking.\n\n\"That kind of pushes the problem further out to more remote ports,\" he said. \"If we haven't got the infrastructure there from a security perspective to check those vehicles then traffickers will definitely use those routes to get migrants into the UK.\"\n\nBritain's National Crime Agency told the BBC that all UK ports were being used for human trafficking.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption All UK ports are being used to get human cargo through, the National Crime Agency says\n\nMore dangerous methods are being used to get human cargo through.\n\nThe most common one is still being hidden in the back of a lorry, but increasingly commercial shipping containers are being used, sometimes even refrigerated ones.\n\nRisks are substantial for the migrants, who can pay \u00a310,000 ($12,900) or more for a space on these vehicles.\n\nA lorry is charged just over \u00a3400 for a ferry crossing from Zeebrugge to Purfleet.\n\nWhy could Bulgaria be significant?\n\nSince the completion of a fence on the Bulgaria-Turkey border in 2016, most asylum seekers trying to reach Western Europe do so hidden in trucks, the BBC's Nick Thorpe reports.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Has Bulgaria become the new route of choice for migrants trying to enter Europe?\n\nOne part of the smugglers' network hands them on to others.\n\nThey are then kept in \"safe\" houses in Bulgaria, usually close to the Serbian or Romanian borders, to be put into new trucks bound for Western Europe, our correspondent says.\n\nIn 2015, the bodies of 71 people were found in an abandoned lorry on an Austrian motorway. Police suspected the vehicle was part of a human trafficking operation. An Afghan and three Bulgarians received long prison sentences for people smuggling, with 10 other accomplices, almost all Bulgarians, being jailed for shorter terms.\n\nHow many migrants have died in transit in the UK?\n\nThe number of migrants who die in transit has been recorded by the UN since 2014.\n\nSince then, five bodies of suspected migrants have been found in lorries or containers in the UK:\n\nData was not collected in the same way before the migrant crisis began in 2014, but such deaths are not new.\n\nIn 2000, 58 Chinese migrants were found suffocated in a lorry at the southern English port of Dover.", "description": "An investigation is launched after the bodies of 39 Chinese nationals are found in a lorry container.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rsndm.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
