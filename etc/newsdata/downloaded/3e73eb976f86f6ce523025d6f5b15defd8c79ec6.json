Its former Kurdish allies immediately forged a new alliance with Assad\u2019s Russia-backed government, inviting the army into towns across the breadth of their territory.\n\nTROOPS ENTER MANBIJ\n\nRussian-backed Syrian forces moved swiftly to fill the void left by departing Americans from Manbij west of the Euphrates river, which Turkey has vowed to capture.\n\n\u201cWe are out of Manbij,\u201d said Colonel Myles B Caggins, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition in Syria. Troops \u201care executing a deliberate withdrawal from northeast Syria.\u201d\n\nA group of journalists accompanied by Syrian army personnel journeyed into Manbij city where upon their arrival a group of people gathered, waving the Syrian flag and pictures of Assad.\n\nHowever the reporters left when gunfire was heard and a group of some 10 young men in Kurdish YPG uniforms began breaking cameras and yelling.\n\nSyrian state media said SDF fighters had opened fire on a march organised by the people of Manbij to welcome the army.\n\nTrump\u2019s pullout ends joint U.S.-Turkish patrols of the Manbij area under a deal aimed to persuade Turkey not to invade.\n\nSyrian state television broadcast footage of what it said was government troops entering Manbij on Tuesday, under their new deal with the Kurds. A resident inside the city told Reuters the Syrian troops were on its outskirts. Turkey-backed Syrian fighters said they would continue their advance towards Manbij.\n\nA Reuters cameraman on the Turkish frontier reported heavy bombardment on Tuesday morning of the Syrian border town of Ras al Ain, where a spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces reported a fierce battle was taking place.\n\nSANCTIONS ANNOUNCEMENT \u201cFALLS VERY SHORT\u201d\n\nTrump has defended his reversal of U.S. policy as part of a plan to withdraw the United States from \u201cendless\u201d wars in the Middle East.\n\nBut his critics, including senior figures in his own Republican Party, cast it as a betrayal of the Kurds, loyal allies who lost thousands of fighters as the principal ground forces in Washington\u2019s battle against Islamic State.\n\nSmoke rises over the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain as seen from the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 15, 2019. REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov\n\nThe Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said Trump\u2019s sanctions were too little, too late.\n\n\u201cHis announcement of a package of sanctions against Turkey falls very short of reversing that humanitarian disaster.\u201d\n\nTurkey says it aims to defeat the Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as terrorists for their links to separatists in Turkey, and to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d where millions of Syrian refugees can be resettled.\n\nThe United Nations says 160,000 people have fled their homes as Turkish forces advance. The Kurdish administration puts the number of displaced at 270,000.\n\nThe U.N. Human Rights office said on Tuesday Turkey could be held responsible for war crimes by fighters under its direction, potentially including the assassination of Hevrin Khalaf, a leading Kurdish politician killed on the side of a highway on Saturday by gunmen who posted the incident on the Internet.\n\nTurkish-backed fighters have denied blame for her murder.\n\nErdogan, who has pledged to continue military operations come what may, said Turkey was giving the world a chance to bring peace to the region.\n\n\u201cThe international community missed its opportunity to prevent the Syrian crisis from pulling an entire region into a maelstrom of instability,\u201d he wrote in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe European Union - and the world - should support what Turkey is trying to do.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian army deployments into Kurdish-held territory evacuated by Washington are a victory for President Bashar al-Assad and his most powerful ally, Russia, giving them a foothold in the biggest remaining swath of the country that had been beyond their grasp.\n\nTrump allies insisted Washington had not given its blessing to the Turkish offensive, and demanded a ceasefire.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America simply is not going to tolerate Turkey\u2019s invasion in Syria any further,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said. \u201cWe are calling on Turkey to stand down, end the violence and come to the negotiating table.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s sanctions include reimposing steel tariffs and halting talks on a trade deal. But bilateral trade between Turkey and the United States is small - around a tenth the size of Turkey\u2019s trade with Europe. Washington\u2019s most effective form of economic leverage would be to hinder Turkey\u2019s access to U.S. financial markets, a step Trump has so far avoided.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\n\u201cThe sanctions are not related to banking, so the markets will have a positive perception,\u201d said Cem Tozge, asset management director at Ata Invest.\n\nIn a potentially more damaging blow, German carmaker Volkswagen said it was postponing a final decision on whether to build a 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) plant in Turkey, citing concern over \u201ccurrent developments\u201d after international condemnation of the incursion.\n\nEuropean countries have criticised the offensive but have limited their response so far to announcing suspensions of arms sales, although weapons account for only a small fraction of EU-Turkish trade.\n\nTrump said U.S. troops would remain at a small garrison at Tanf in southern Syria \u201cto continue to disrupt remnants\u201d of Islamic State.
