So that they can talk about who they are and what they believe in, in everyday ways, instead of having to be like a rock star.\u201d\n\nAccording to the outlet, Macpherson has used her supermodel status to build a thriving empire worth a whopping $95 million. Most recently, Macpherson launched a line of plant-based elixirs with her business venture, WelleCo. She previously embarked on design and acting.\n\n\u201cThe business of modeling has changed,\u201d Macpherson explained. \u201cIn the \u201880s and \u201890s when I first started, everything was about bigger, better, bolder \u2014 your work was about creating an image and that was the most important thing, your image.\u201d\n\nELLE MACPHERSON, 54, REVEALS ONE SECRET BEHIND KEEPING \u2018THE BODY\u2019 IN BIKINI-READY SHAPE\n\n\u201cWhen I first started modeling in Australia\u2026 you did everything \u2014 you were a hand model, a foot model, swimwear, runway, TV commercials. If you wanted to earn money, you had to be versatile\u2026 I was so lucky because, at that time, there was the rise of the supermodel. It started to become a very powerful industry.\u201d\n\nBack in 2018, Macpherson insisted on \u201cThis Morning\u201d that she hasn\u2019t gone under the knife to maintain her famous features.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t done any plastic surgery, not that I have any judgment \u2013 it just hasn\u2019t been my choice,\u201d she claimed at the time. \u201cI like a natural-looking face.\u201d\n\nThe Sports Illustrated Swimsuit star, who skyrocketed to fame in the \u201880s, insisted she\u2019s proud of how her body has changed over the years, especially after becoming a mother to two sons.\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ GIVES POLE-DANCING LESSON IN 'HUSTLERS' SNEAK-PEEK SCENE\n\n\u201cI try to do some exercise every day, but thank goodness I don\u2019t have the same body as in my 20s,\u201d said the Australian model. \u201cThis body has birthed two incredible boys and lived through amazing stages of fashion and fitness. There have been many changes and I\u2019m grateful to be able to evolve over time. I\u2019m open to change and evolve. These are tangible assets in my life.\u201d\n\nELLE MACPHERSON REGRETS HER ICONIC 'FRIENDS' ROLE\n\nMacpherson said the secret behind her confidence has been to maintain a healthy lifestyle with the help of a plant-based diet.\n\n\u201cWhen I turned 50 I realized things I did in my 20s weren\u2019t working anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cI follow a plant-based alkaline diet, focusing on healthy, whole food.\n\n\"I take green powder and protein powder every day, and I drink three liters of water a day. Being Australian, the outdoors has always been important to me. So I like to get out, hike, walk the dogs, swim laps and I do yoga in the evening. There\u2019s been such a change not just in my body, but my wellbeing.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Macpherson has claimed she hasn\u2019t considered plastic surgery. Back in 2016, she told UK\u2019s Telegraph she preferred having a no-nonsense diet over anything else.\n\nELLE MACPHERSON SAYS SHE HAS NEVER GOTTEN PLASTIC SURGERY TO MAINTAIN 'THE BODY'\n\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t had surgery; it\u2019s not in my game plan,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any perspective on it for anybody else, only for myself. I would worry because I know things can go wrong really easily. With some of these procedures, you might feel that you look younger, but it doesn\u2019t look quite right.\n\n\u201cSo I try to keep it really natural, I can\u2019t do laser on my skin because I\u2019ve spent so much time in the sun and it gets hyperpigmentation.\u201d\n\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean Macpherson hasn\u2019t dabbled in certain procedures. When asked if she has tried Botox and collagen to smooth out the signs of aging, she simply said yes.\n\n'HUSTLERS' MOVIE: EVERYTHING WE KNOW INCLUDING THE TRAILER, CAST AND PLOT OF THE STAR-STUDDED FILM\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve tried things, but most of the time they don\u2019t work for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work for my face \u2013 some people get things done and they look worse. I\u2019m a bit of a scaredy-cat and I don\u2019t want to mess with what there is. At this point, I think it\u2019s best to leave what I have alone.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, I do vitamin injections, infusions and I work on my nutrition,\u201d she added. \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve learned that a good smile, good teeth, good hair, good skin, a good mood are worth a thousand injectables and Botox and facials and masks.\u201d", "description": "Elle Macpherson, famously known as \u201cThe Body,\u201d believes models need to be more relatable to the public.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/09/26/694940094001_5141455488001_Elle-Macpherson-rethinks--Friends--stint.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
