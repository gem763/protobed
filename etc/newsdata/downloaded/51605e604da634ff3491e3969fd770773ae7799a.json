Following Seattle\u2019s recent announcement that it experienced more than 500 \u201chate crimes\u201d and serious \u201chate incidents\u201d during 2018 \u2014 which resulted in a feature story in the Seattle Times \u2014 Washington, D.C., recently declared that it suffered \u201c204 suspected hate crimes\u201d last year. Extremism researcher Brian Levin popped up to declare that the nation\u2019s capital thus had the highest per capita hate crime rate among large American cities, and the hometown Post ran a major piece decrying D.C.\u2019s \u201cRecord Breaking Year of Hatred.\u201d\n\nFortunately for normal Americans, who tend to like our countrymen across racial and class lines, the reality in both D.C. and Seattle is very different from the headlines. Investigating the alleged hate epidemic in Seattle at the behest of the online journal Quillette, I found first that only 125 of 521 incidents reported to the police were serious enough \u2014 i.e. felonies or A/B misdemeanors \u2014 to be legally prosecuted as hate crimes.\n\nOf those, very few were the work of serious bigots: The typical perpetrator was a mentally ill, homeless man. According to undisputed data from the Seattle city auditor, 22 percent of hate perps were \u201cliving unsheltered\u201d at the time of their crime, 20 percent were mentally disturbed and another 20 percent were drunks or otherwise \u201cseverely intoxicated.\u201d As a result of the low-level, anonymous nature of many of these cases, successful prosecutions in Seattle hate matters are vanishingly rare. While the city reports more hate crimes than 33 U.S. states \u2014 including Florida \u2014 the total number of Emerald City hate crime cases actually prosecuted to conviction between 2012 and 2017 was 37 \u2014 about six per year.\n\nOne major factor behind Seattle\u2019s decision to pursue incidents of verbal assault by vagrants as hate crimes seems to have been the city\u2019s 2015 decision to hire a sort of Special Master for Hate \u2014 a brass-level bias crimes coordinator, whose job includes \u201ccommunity outreach\u201d aimed at spreading awareness of the definition of hate crime and presumably generating new reports. The hate crime definition used by Seattle has itself expanded far past the national standard in recent years, going beyond race and religion to label attacks motivated by political ideology, age, homelessness and \u201cmarital or parental status\u201d as hate crimes. Given these two variables, it is probably no coincidence that hate incidents in Seattle \u201cincreased\u201d by 162 from 2016-17 and by another 103 from 2017-18. In a remarkable display of honesty, the city\u2019s auditor pointed out that this \u201crise in reported hate crimes does not necessarily mean there are more of these crimes occurring.\u201d\n\nUnpacking the Washington, D.C., data reveals similar patterns. First, the \u201crecord breaking\u201d per capita surge in hate crime turns out to involve an increase of exactly 26 incidents \u2014 from 178 in 2017 to 204 in 2018. Further, of the 204 suspected hate crimes reported in 2018, just 59 cases led to an adult suspect being identified and facing charges of any kind. Exactly three 2018 D.C. cases were formally prosecuted as hate crimes, and charges in one of those were rapidly dropped. Despite an intense focus on bias crimes \u2014 the primary District of Columbia legal authority has two bias crime coordinators \u2014 actual hate crime prosecutions and convictions in the capital seem to be at their lowest ebb in 10 years. At least off the record, many D.C. police openly attribute this to the minor and random nature of many incidents now reported as hate crimes, such as anonymous \u201cracist or anti-Semitic graffiti.\u201d\n\nAnalyzing D.C. hate crime numbers leads to a taboo but essential discussion about the real nature of crime in America. The archetypal American racial crime would probably be five skinheads or rednecks beating a black man, and almost all articles about alleged increases in hate crime mention this trope or refer ominously to \u201cthe age of Trump.\u201d The Washington Post certainly goes in for a bit of this with Mike Miller opening his article with the story of a 12-year old black girl attacked by a white racist, and opining that many scholars see a connection between \u201cTrump\u2019s ugly rhetoric\u201d toward persons of color and \u201cwhat has been unleashed in communities across the country.\u201d The data, however, tell a rather different story.\n\nFirst, the majority of District of Columbia hate incidents have nothing to do with race at all. In 2018, 94 D.C. hate crime cases involved people insulted or attacked because of gay or transgender identity, while only 75 involved a racial or ethnic attack. Importantly, D.C. is a 65 percent non-white city, and the town\u2019s gay bashers seem to largely match its demographics: A typical case reported by The Washington Post involved a black gay man (Rudolph Williams) who was struck with a champagne bottle and called a \u201cfaggy [expletive]\u201d inside a heavily black nightclub.\n\nEven among racial hate crime cases, 15 (20 percent) involved attacks on whites, 24 (32 percent) involved attacks on Hispanics by African-Americans or whites, and only 26 (35 percent) were anti-black attacks \u2014 presumably not all committed by whites. The suspect in the most disturbing anti-Semitic attack described by The Post eventually turned out to be an Ethiopian guy named Yohannes Lemma. In another case, the paper, to its credit, reported in full, that the victim was a white man attacked with a rock for supporting President Trump. Should we take Washington, D.C.\u2019s reported increase in hate crime at face value, the surge most definitely does not consist primarily of Trump-crazed conservatives attacking innocent minorities.\n\nSimply put, actually analyzing the data on hate crime from two major cities should remind us to be skeptical of claims that our great country is \u201cawash with hate.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Wilfred Reilly is the author of \u201cHate Crime Hoax: How The Left is Selling A Fake Race War\u201d (Regnery).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
