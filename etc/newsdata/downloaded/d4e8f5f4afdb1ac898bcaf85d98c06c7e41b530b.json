Recent Western competitors to the Su-57 like the F-35 have been produced in the hundreds. But a look at contemporary Russian aircraft production and procurement, as well as the Soviet Su-27 program suggests that this order of 76 aircraft may be just the first step that could be ramped up significantly in the near future.\n\nThe Su-57 in many ways is the successor to the Su-27, a premier air superiority fighter meant to fight the best fighters an enemy might present. As a result, it\u2019s packed to the brim with the best technology Russia\u2019s aerospace can offer: powerful engines, advanced maneuverability features, and top-of-the-line avionics including an AESA radar.\n\nAll of these technologies are costly to develop, so the fighter that incorporates them will need to be a highly refined design that can serve for decades, as the Su-27 did. The Su-27 program took nearly fifteen years to reach design maturity. The long process was due to various aerodynamic redesigns of the airframe. As the Su-57 went through several iterations of its airframe as well, the project is following roughly the same trajectory as the Su-27.\n\nBut when the design was finalized, Su-27s were produced at the rate of over sixty a year during the first few years of production. By the start of the 1990s, over one hundred were in service. But Russia\u2019s plans to procure the Su-57 don\u2019t appear to follow the same plan of rapidly ramping up once the design is \u201cfinalized\u201d: at seventy-six aircraft by 2028, that comes out to slightly less than nine aircraft per year, a stark change from the Su-27\u2019s production rate.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Coming soon, but not that soon.", "authors": ["Charlie Gao"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.l2FPy6SeTUQ1j587pcq7A--~B/aD04NjQ7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/3bd8aa9c047722d38cdad14c5b2d9936", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
