But insurance may not pay.", "language": "en", "text": "Lymphedema is incurable, but specialized compression stockings, sleeves and gloves help prevent complications such as tissue damage, more swelling and infection.\n\nAD\n\nThey\u2019re also expensive.\n\nVander Linden\u2019s insurance coverage, which she gets through her job as a senior director of communications at a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group, covers about half the annual cost of her stockings. For the rest of the year, she said, she pays out of pocket \u2015 between $2,500 and $3,500.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI guess they\u2019re thinking I don\u2019t have to stand up\u201d for half the year, she said.\n\nMany lymphedema patients struggle to get health insurers to pay for compression garments. Coverage varies among private insurance plans, and for many patients it is limited. Although Medicaid programs cover some of these expenses, Medicare does not.\n\nAdvocates have been pushing for legislation to change that. \u201cRight now there is a patch quilt across the country to navigate to get the care that you need,\u201d said William Repicci, chief executive of the Lymphatic Education & Research Network, a patient advocacy group.\n\nAD\n\nLymphedema affects as many as 5 million people in the United States. The majority develop the condition after undergoing cancer treatment, especially if they had surgery that required removing lymph nodes to stop the spread of disease. Breast cancer patients are particularly affected by the condition.\n\nAD\n\nPeople generally wear the garments daily, said Stanley Rockson, a physician and professor of lymphatic research and medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine in California. Depending on the severity of the disease, some people also require them at night.\n\nPrices for garments vary considerably. A standard-fit arm sleeve costs $81, but a custom-made equivalent can run $202, according to the Lymphedema Advocacy Group, a patient volunteer organization seeking a federal mandate for insurance coverage. One pair of waist-high stockings costs $159 off the shelf. When made to order \u2014 some patients need custom garments because the standard size cannot adequately accommodate the affected area \u2014 the price can jump to $960.\n\nAD\n\nGarments should be replaced two to four times a year, Rockson said. The 1998 federal Women\u2019s Health and Cancer Rights Act has helped some patients get insurers to cover their compression garments. The law requires most insurers that provide coverage for mastectomies to also cover complications related to the procedure, including these socks and sleeves. It applies to employer-based plans, as well as those that people buy on the individual market. However, the law still allows insurers to set some limits on the coverage.\n\nAD\n\nA handful of states, including Maryland and Virginia, have laws requiring health plans subject to state regulation to cover lymphedema treatment, including supplies such as compression garments. Virginia\u2019s law, from 2004, was the nation\u2019s first. Maryland\u2019s took effect this year.\n\n\u201cI know that it\u2019s not a panacea. It\u2019s not going to address every problem that patients are running into when it comes to lymphedema treatment,\u201d said Alfred C. Carr Jr. (D), the Maryland General Assembly member who sponsored the law after a constituent brought the issue to his attention. \u201cBut hopefully it makes things easier and better.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt least three other states \u2014 California, Massachusetts and North Carolina \u2014 require health insurers to pay some of the costs, according to an analysis from the Maryland Department of Legislative Services.\n\nAD\n\nBut many people aren\u2019t covered by these laws because large-employer health plans are generally regulated by the federal government. In Maryland, approximately 25 percent of residents have plans that may be affected, state officials estimated.\n\nEven if compression garments are covered, plan restrictions \u2015 such as limits on how many stockings or sleeves are allowed \u2015 can leave enrollees\u2019 needs unmet.\n\nThat happened to Cindy Cronick.\n\nIn 2007, the Wisconsin pharmacist found a lump under her arm, and doctors diagnosed her with breast cancer. She underwent chemotherapy, radiation and a mastectomy and remains cancer-free.\n\nAD\n\nBut in 2012, she said, lymphedema dramatically caused her left arm and hand to swell. (The condition can accumulate years after an operation.)\n\nHer employer-provided health plan, according to Cronick, 53, covered only four compression garments a year. This became a problem when she needed another compression glove because the old one was causing an abrasion, which can increase the risk of developing an infection. The glove, which came with a sleeve, cost around $200, Cronick said.\n\nAD\n\nCronick, who is a board member of the Lymphedema Advocacy Group, ultimately appealed to her insurer, and then an outside reviewer in New York, for more coverage. The case ended in 2013 with the insurer doubling the number of garments it covered. The insurer changed its policy the following year to allow patients with post-mastectomy garments to go beyond their limit.\n\nAD\n\nAfter Cronick switched to her husband\u2019s health plan, she received other denials that she was forced to appeal, she said. She filed a complaint against the insurer with the Department of Labor, according to documents Cronick provided. As of Sept. 5, the investigation was still pending.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a certain number,\u201d Cronick said, referring to the number of garments covered under health plans. \u201cIt should be what that patient and their doctor determine is required.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat option is not available to Medicare beneficiaries. Compression garments do not meet the definition for any category of covered services. Legislation to provide Medicare coverage for lymphedema diagnosis and treatment has been repeatedly introduced in Congress since 2002, but it has gone nowhere.\n\nAD\n\nAdvocates said they think adding the government benefit would prompt more private insurers to pay for the stockings as well. The federal program\u2019s reputation for being a benchmark of insurance coverage \u201cmakes this super valuable to get Medicare\u201d to cover the garments, said Jeffrey Clemens, an associate professor of economics at the University of California at San Diego who focuses on health issues.\n\nBut other health-care experts say it may not be the cure-all advocates hope for.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not a simple matter of if you succeed in getting Medicare coverage, then all the private insurers are going to fall in line really rapidly,\u201d said Jack Hoadley, a former member of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. \u201cI would say that\u2019s probably not realistic.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.
