Absolute disgrace them being subjected to another man \"daddy\" in their lives.\n\n\"Seriously worrying. Also this modeling milarkey. I'd get the courts to step in and stop them being used on social media the way they are. I feel very sorry for them.\"\n\nThe Mirror approached Kieran Hayler for further comment at the time.\n\nKatie found love with her ex-husband Kieran when they were first put in touch on online chat service Blackberry Messenger in November 2012.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIt was a whirlwind romance as the couple were married in the Bahamas in January 2013, just shortly after he got down on one knee on Christmas Day 2012.\n\nThey renewed their vows in October 2016 but their romance wasn't meant to last as Katie dumped Kieran for good in 2018.\n\nKieran has since been going steady with Michelle Penticost whom he went public with in August last year.\n\n(Image: Brett D.
