He has formed a coalition between the centre-left Democratic party (PD) and anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Migrants board vans after leaving the Ocean Viking.

The idea is to relocate the asylum seekers to other EU countries before they landing in Italy.\n\nThe plan has gained immediate support from Berlin and Paris.\n\nThe German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said that in the future his country would be ready to take 25% of rescued migrants landing in Italy. \u201cThat won\u2019t be too much for our immigration policy,\u201d he told S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.\n\n\u201cWe now need to agree on a genuine temporary European mechanism,\u201d the French interior minister, Christophe Castaner, tweeted on Saturday.\n\nEU interior ministers announced they will meet in Malta on 23 September to try to formalise the temporary deal, ahead of a summit in Luxembourg next October.\n\n\u201cThis is the end of Salvini\u2019s propaganda over the skin of desperate people at sea and the beginning of good international relations with other countries,\u201d Dario Franceschini, Italy\u2019s minister for culture and leader of the PD party, said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe new government has opened again its seaports to migrants,\u201d replied Salvini, who is now forced to watch from the opposition benches. \u201cThe new ministers must hate our country. Italy is back to being Europe\u2019s refugee camp.\u201d", "description": "EU ministers pledge support as 82 disembark from NGO boat, ending Salvini\u2019s entry ban", "authors": ["Lorenzo Tondo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5329f4f88030f9b71ba892602e617f5559b440d/0_66_1373_824/master/1373.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=11bd6ff08d71d0b121b937eec31bea28", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
