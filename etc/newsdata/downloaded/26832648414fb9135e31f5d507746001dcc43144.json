Syria. Abondoned Kurds show their disappointment and anger to American forces who were ordered to withdraw. One sign reads \u2018Tell your children that the children of the Kurds were killed by the Turks and you did nothing to protect them\" #SaveKurds pic.twitter.com/9DY89fdxd9 \u2014 Mutlu Civiroglu (@mutludc) October 21, 2019\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s decision to abandon Kurdish allies by pulling American troops from northern Syria to cede the battlefield to a Turkish invasion has been harshly criticized by military leaders and both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear where in northern Syria the videos were shot. Some news photos of an exiting American convoy were taken in Tel Tamr.\n\nHundreds of trucks carrying U.S. personnel were gathering near Hasakah in Syria earlier Sunday, en route east to the border with Iraq, CNN reported. It was the largest ground movement the U.S. has made so far in Syria, effectively marking the end of a major American presence in the area.\n\nclaimed the U.S. troops were coming home. But Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced Saturday that all of the nearly 1,000 U.S. forces in Syria are being moved to western Iraq.\n\nI feel deep shame for what has happened to our allies the Kurds. I suspect that the service members in those vehicles, flying AMERICAN flags, are mortified that they left our allies defenseless and in fear of their very existence. Make no mistake, only 1 coward is responsible. 45 \u2014 BB160 (@BB160) October 21, 2019\n\nGod this breaks my heart. \u2014 Jeanne Murdock \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0e (@jeanniedm) October 21, 2019\n\nI\u2019m so sorry. \ud83d\ude22 \u2014 Otto Titsling4 (Heavenly Mandate Titsling) (@titsling4) October 21, 2019\n\nI watch this and I wonder how many of these people will survive.
