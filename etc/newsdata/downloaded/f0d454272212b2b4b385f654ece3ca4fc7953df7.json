Dealing with hyperactive kids all day is exhausting, and sometimes you\u2019re just too tired to carefully explain to tiny humans why you need them to just sit and watch TV for an hour.\n\nOne mum has shared the genius way she gets her children to stay still.\n\nJessica D\u2019Entremont, a mum who shares her parenting journey on Instagram to spread awareness of sensory processing disorders, needed her children to stay still for a few minutes.\n\nThe family had had a busy day, with Jessica\u2019s daughters \u2018about to start freaking out\u2019 after a day of shopping, crowds, and noise.\n\nThe mum\u2019s approach was pretty brilliant: She bought them glow in the dark pyjamas, then told her kids that they needed to lie still and quiet under the lights to \u2018charge\u2019 them \u2013 otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have the light energy to glow later on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEt voila: the kids patiently lay down under the lights for as long as necessary.\n\nJessica, from Poughkeepsie, shared her wisdom on Facebook, where it was shared more than 100,000 times.\n\nAfter the comments praising the trickery flooded in, the mum shared an update, writing: \u2018To expand on the trickery I\u2019ve started putting the pjs back into their drawer when they get dressed in the morning\u2026\u2026unexposed to light all day they dim and do not glow in the dark when they tried to test me last night until they laid down again. Reinforcing the need to lie quietly under the light before bed.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a benevolent lie, really. Having a makeshift meditation session before bed is a great way to relax and decompress \u2013 even if the kids don\u2019t know that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not even sorry,\u2019 wrote Jessica.\n\nWe reckon she can get away with it for a while longer. Just delete the evidence of the scheme going viral before those children turn into teens.\n\nDo you have a brilliant parenting hack you\u2019d be up for sharing?
