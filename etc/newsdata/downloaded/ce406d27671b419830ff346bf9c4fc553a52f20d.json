With Ben Chilwell overlapping from left-back, Maddison can attack central positions and cause problems for a full-back like Trent Alexander-Arnold - does he follow Maddison inside and disrupt the defensive shape or pass him on to the holding midfielder? And if Fabinho has to watch Maddison, does he track him or hold position to avoid Tielemans exploiting the vacant space?\n\nIt is as one of Leicester\u2019s two \u2018eights\u2019 that Maddison is most dangerous, able to get involved in every aspect of build-up and approach play, and we may see Harvey Barnes start wide left against Liverpool to facilitate this. Chilwell will be kept busy by Mohamed Salah, meaning Leicester need natural attacking width to create space for Maddison to work his magic when in possession.\n\nEngland don\u2019t play with a \u201810\u2019 which might explain Maddison\u2019s omission from the first XI thus far, even if the player insists he is more of an 'eight' these days. \u201cA lot of teams don\u2019t really play with a No 10 these days,\" he said in a recent interview with The Athletic. \"Not in the conventional sense, anyway. I\u2019d say my best position was as a No 8 now but I can play off the left, as a No 10, wherever - as long as I\u2019m on the pitch and able to express myself, that\u2019s all that really matters.\u201d\n\nMaddison's player radar is quite different to last season, with the midfielder keeping the ball more often and dribbling past defenders more often than sending that killer ball. Depending on how Rodgers wants to use him this season, the graph for 2019/20 could look more like 2018/19 come May.", "description": "James Maddison has created 111 chances to score in the Premier League since the start of last season - more than any other player.", "authors": ["Jj Bull", "Paul Hayward"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000210296160-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqS8LvVGaCov9_zEWH2d7j7f7uG-EXu1vQjA186ek-eCk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
