It's been a marvellous tournament so far\".\n\nIt will be 28 days between the All Blacks' opening pool win over South Africa and their quarter-final with only matches against minnows Canada and Namibia in between.\n\n\"The most important thing that happens now is how we adapt and adjust to it,\" Hansen said of the shortage of quality match play.\n\n\"The players have to get their heads round the fact we're not playing and the coaching group have to get our heads round the fact we're not playing and adjust our preparation accordingly.\"\n\nHansen refused to reveal the team he was due to announce on Thursday to play Italy.\n\nBut he did confirm the cancellation affected lock Brodie Retallick and centre Jack Goodhue, who only recently returned from injury and were in need of more game time.\n\nThe two points New Zealand have received for a match deemed a draw mean they will advance as Pool B winners ahead of South Africa.\n\nThe All Blacks now face a quarter-final against the runner-up in Pool A - a three-way battle between Japan, Ireland and Scotland.\n\nIreland's final pool game against Samoa will go ahead on the southern island of Kyushu on Saturday while the fate of the crunch match between Japan and Scotland on Sunday has yet to be decided.", "description": "England coach Eddie Jones says Super Typhoon Hagibis has given his team a \"great opportunity\" after their final group game was cancelled.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9319/0c54e60bd9fe46b68471dca5ea84ed03.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
