To symbolise the rising sea levels, hundreds of protesters laid silently on the usually busy road just before 1pm on Sunday.\n\nExtinction Rebellion protests have been seen all across Australia and the world this week as part of the Spring Uprising. We\u2019ve seen naked protests in Melbourne, people chaining themselves to cars, and even activists literally burying their heads in the sand at Manly Beach.\n\nThe protesters are demanding that the government declare a climate emergency, be transparent about the state of the planet, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and develop a Citizens\u2019 Assembly on the issue.\n\nAlthough today marks the final day of the Spring Uprising, it seems unlikely that the protests will cease in the coming weeks. After countless arrests and peaceful disruptions, the Extinction Rebellion group are showing no signs of slowing down until the government takes action against the threat of climate change.\n\nMany of the activists that attended the event took to social media to share their images from today\u2019s protest.\n\nStunning scenes of peaceful protest at Bondi Beach #ExtinctionRebellion #ClimateCrisis @XRebellionAus pic.twitter.com/VFmhUpUYRV \u2014 Avril J, Founder of businesses with purpose (@TemplesMarkets) October 13, 2019\n\nTwo of the terrifying tangoers at this morning\u2019s #ExtinctionRebellion protest on Bondi Beach.
