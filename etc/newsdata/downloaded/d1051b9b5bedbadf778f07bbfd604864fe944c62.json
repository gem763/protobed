Much of it will likely track the usual course of an athlete\u2019s memoir. The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat and a few fun and/or sad and/or thoughtful anecdotes along the way. One bit of it, though, is not the stuff of the usual athlete memoir.\n\nHe writes that he ctually rooted against the San Francisco Giants \u2014 his own team \u2014 in the 2010 World Series. He did so because he was left off the postseason roster, felt miserable about it and let his ego consume him. From the San Francisco Chronicle:\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cIt was really hard to admit . . . I rooted against the team because my ego was in full control and if we lost then I could get out of there . . . It would a) prove they couldn\u2019t do it without me, and b) take me out of the situation because I was so miserable coming to the field every day. I was so deep in shame. I wanted out of that situation so bad.\u201d\n\nZito at that point was midway through a seven-year, $126 million contract he signed with the Giants after the 2006 season. Almost as soon as he signed it he transformed from one of the better pitchers in the game \u2014 he had a 124 ERA+ in eight seasons with the Oakland Athletics and won the 2002 Cy Young Award \u2014 to being a liability for the Giants. Indeed, he only had one season in San Francisco where, again, by ERA+, he was a league-average starter or better. In 2010 he went 9-14 with a 4.15 ERA and was way worse than that down the stretch. It made perfect sense for the Giants to leave him off the 2010 postseason roster. And, of course, it worked out for them.\n\nStory continues\n\nThings would improve. He\u2019d still generally struggle as a Giant, but in 2012 he was a hero of the NLCS, pitching the Giants past the Cardinals in a must-win game. He then got the Game 1 start in the World Series and beat Justin Verlander as the Giants won that game and then swept the Tigers out of the series. As time went on he\u2019d fine more personal happiness as well. When his contract ended following the 2013 season Zito took out a full-page ad in the San Francisco Chronicle thanking Giants fans for their support. He\u2019d leave the game in 2014 and pitch three more games for the Athletics in 2015 before retiring for good.\n\nNot many baseball memoirs deliver hard truths like Zito\u2019s appears willing to do. That\u2019s pretty damn brave of him. And pretty damn admirable.", "description": "Zito won Game 1 of the 2012 World Series but he was far less happy in 2010.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eSV6uLC2ASobMoPswYQloQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjIuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1.5IwDk.gvEq6vbPf54ZzA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkxNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/6a038a2f5494defe301c11301e4e996c", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
