That is not true,\" Ward said as Rotellini tried to continue.\n\nIn a major foreign policy win for the Trump administration, U.S. special forces raided an Islamic State (ISIS) compound in northern Syria; Baghdadi ultimately killed himself by setting off a suicide vest. Overall, U.S. forces killed six ISIS members.\n\nPENTAGON RELEASES VIDEO OF RAID THAT KILLED ISIS LEADER ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI\n\n\u201cIt was a poor choice of words,\u201d Matt Grodksy, spokesman for the Arizona Democratic Party, told The Arizona Republic. Nevertheless, he said the comments had stemmed from \u201cPresident Trump's haphazard decision to withdraw troops from Syria, which has been opposed by Republicans and Democrats alike because it abandoned our Kurdish allies in the fight against ISIS, empowered Iran, Russia and the Syrian regime, and hurt our interests in the region.\u201d\n\nWard said Rotellini\u2019s comments were \u201cwildly irresponsible.\u201d \"It is extremely disconcerting to hear the top Democrat in Arizona slander and malign an innocent person for being aligned with the world\u2019s most evil terrorists, let alone the president of the United States,\u201d she said, according to the newspaper.\n\nUS LABELS LEBANON BANK WITH HEZBOLLAH TIES A 'GLOBAL TERRORIST,' SANCTIONS IRANIAN NETWORKS LINKED TO REGIME\n\n\u201cWhile fear-mongering from the left is expected up to a point, we have to draw the line somewhere if they\u2019re going to refuse to police themselves. Baseless statements like those made by the chair of the Arizona (Democratic Party) are wildly irresponsible and not rooted in reality.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDemocrats and Republicans had been leery of Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, opening the door for a Turkish incursion targeting the Kurds, U.S. allies in efforts to contain the terror group.\n\nSome worried that it might allow ISIS to re-establish a stronghold in the region. The death of not only Baghdadi but also Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, a possible successor to Baghdadi, in a separate operation led by U.S. forces has helped ease some of those fears.", "description": "Talk about awkward timing-- hours before President Trump announced the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the chairwoman of the Arizona Democratic Party said publicly that Trump had aligned himself with the terrorist organization.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP_Felecia-Rotellini.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
