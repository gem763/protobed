In many cases, related health problems including diabetes and high blood pressure vanished after surgery.\n\nWhile most of those studies involved teens, one included children younger than 12 and found no ill effects on growth, the policy says.\n\n\u201cSafe and effective is the message here,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Armstrong, a Duke University pediatrics professor and the policy\u2019s lead author.\n\nArmstrong said children who have not gone through puberty may not be mature enough to understand the life-changing implications of surgery but that age alone shouldn\u2019t rule it out. She doesn\u2019t do surgery but works at a center that offers it; the youngest patient was 14.\n\nIt\u2019s not a quick fix, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifelong decision with implications every single day for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nNearly 5 million U.S. children and teens are severely obese, a near doubling over 20 years. Many have already developed related health problems including diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea and liver disease. But most kids don\u2019t get obesity surgery, mainly because most public and private health insurance doesn\u2019t cover it or they live far from surgery centers, Armstrong said. Costs can total at least $20,000.\n\nResistance from pediatricians is another obstacle. Many prefer \u201cwatchful waiting,\u201d or think surgery is risky or will alter kids\u2019 growth. Some don\u2019t recommend surgery because they think \u201cweight is a personal responsibility rather than a medical problem,\u201d the new policy states.\n\nDr. Rebecca Carter, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said the new recommendations give pediatricians better guidance about which patients should be referred and evaluated.\n\nRecent data show that pediatric obesity surgery rates have tripled in almost 20 years but still average fewer than 2,000 operations each year.\n\nThe academy\u2019s recommendation say children and teens are generally eligible for surgery if their body mass index is 40 or higher, or at least 35 if they have related major health problems. These criteria may vary by gender and age, Armstrong said. They are similar to criteria for surgeons from the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. A BMI of 30 and above is considered obese.\n\nFaith Newsome was a typical patient. At 5 feet, 8 inches and 273 pounds, her BMI was almost 42 and she had high blood pressure and prediabetes when she had gastric bypass surgery at Duke at age 16. After about a year, she had shed 100 pounds and those health problems disappeared. She slimmed down enough to become active in sports, shop for prom dresses and gain a better self-image. But to avoid malnutrition she takes vitamins, must eat small meals and gets sick if she eats foods high in fat or sugar. Her BMI, at just under 30, puts her in the overweight range.\n\nNow 21 and a senior at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, Newsome is quick to answer whether she has regrets.\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d she said. \u201cTeens should be able to discuss every option with their doctors, and surgery should be one of those options.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer at @LindseyTanner.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
