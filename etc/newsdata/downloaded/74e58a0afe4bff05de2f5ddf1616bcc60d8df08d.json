And as fascinating and poignant as that was, our perspective was necessarily limited to what Alma was experiencing. There are other characters in Undone, and this episode, wisely, is all about showing us what Alma looks like to the rest of the world.\n\nAnd frankly: It\u2019s not always great.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Sam, who both believes and engages with Alma\u2019s quest to solve the mystery of her father\u2019s death. Sam spends much of the episode playing catchup and poring through files about Jacob\u2019s past. The main action finds Alma and Sam traveling to San Antonio University to dig into a break-in at Jacob\u2019s lab on the night of his death. A security guard named Nancy initially freezes them out \u2014 but while Sam\u2019s attempt to charm her fails, Alma uses her ability to discover, understand, and empathize with the tragedy of Nancy\u2019s missing sister, which is enough to coerce Nancy to give them the files they need.\n\nThis is clearly not an easy experience for Alma, who lives Nancy\u2019s entire life in an instant to get the information she requires. But Undone makes an interesting choice here: We see this entire scene from Sam\u2019s perspective, not Alma\u2019s. And through his eyes, the exchange is \u2026 unsettling? Manipulative? Maybe even a little cruel?\n\nThe trail of breadcrumbs leads them to the doorstep of Darrold, the ex-boyfriend of Jacob\u2019s late teacher\u2019s assistant Farnaz. Darrold is openly hostile to Alma and Sam, which causes Alma to bristle but, under the circumstances, seems fairly understandable to me. He tells Alma that Jacob was a psycho and that his research was bullshit, and threatens to call the cops if they don\u2019t leave.\n\nMeanwhile \u2014 in a B plot that brings Undone back down to earth \u2014 we spend a day with Alma\u2019s mother, Camila. Camila clearly plays a vital role in a number of people\u2019s lives: She\u2019s friendly with the children in her neighborhood, active in her congregation, and deeply devoted to what she thinks his best for her daughters \u2014 even if Reed Hollingsworth\u2019s mother is openly condescending to her and Alma is worrying her by refusing to take her pills.\n\nAs with Sam, Undone gives us several scenes that are specifically from Camila\u2019s perspective. She notices that Becca flinches away from Reed\u2019s touch, and it bothers her. She\u2019s elated when Father Miguel asks her to light the Pascal candle at midnight mass on Easter. And when Becca bows out to attend a protestant service with the Hollingsworth family, she\u2019s understanding enough to let her go \u2014 even if it means she spends the evening fretting over the possibility that neither of her daughters will be there to witness a liturgical honor that means so much to her.\n\nIn the end, Alma shows up, but her conversation with Camila quickly devolves into an argument about Alma\u2019s mental state. And this puts audiences in a tricky place. By this point, we know for a fact that Alma is right. But the entire episode has been spent outside of her very unique headspace. To everyone else, when Alma has a conversation with herself and says it was dad, or gets so lost in time she doesn\u2019t remember ringing a doorbell two minutes earlier \u2026 well, you understand why the people in her life might be getting worried.\n\nWhatever anyone else believes, we know that Alma\u2019s ability is real, because we\u2019ve spent the past five episodes watching her use it in real and tangible ways. But the more human, subjective side of her arc still requires closer scrutiny. \u201cThis is about justice, and saving my dad, and not taking shit from anyone ever again,\u201d Alma tells Sam near the end of the episode.\n\nAnd honestly: That sounds like a lot of mission creep. It\u2019s easy to think of Alma\u2019s situation as a binary problem: Either her power is real and she\u2019s on a life-or-death mission, or she\u2019s delusional and none of this means anything. But what if the truth is more complicated than that? What if Alma\u2019s power is real and Jacob is completely wrong about the conspiracy surrounding his death? What if Alma\u2019s power is real and she\u2019s a real human being with real flaws she still needs to address?\n\nAnd that brings us back to Camila, who Alma blows up at \u2014 yet again \u2014 right after the midnight Easter mass that was so important to her mother. And on principle, I\u2019d say Alma is right here: Her mom shouldn\u2019t be so pushy about medicine, and she certainly shouldn\u2019t have enlisted her priest to lecture Alma about it.\n\nBut on the other hand: It was just one episode ago that Alma, using her ability, found it in her heart to understand and forgive Sam for something much, much worse. It makes me wonder what would happen if Alma took the same kind of super-powered empathy she expelled on Nancy the Security Guard and applied it to her own mother, who skips church and \u2014 in an apparent crisis of faith \u2014 doesn\u2019t leave out the Easter eggs she so cheerfully promised the kids in the neighborhood just a day earlier.\n\nWould that be enough to help defuse Alma\u2019s difficult relationship with her mother? Because I don\u2019t have Alma\u2019s ability, but God, my heart broke for Camila.\n\nPieces of Mind\n\n\u2022 Late in the episode, Sam watches an old home video of Jacob, dressed in white, mumbling about the Valley of the White Cactus while doing some kind of smoke ritual. This is as good a time as any to make predictions for the rest of the season, so here\u2019s my guess: Darrold is right. Jacob went off the deep end, and his death in the car accident was a tragic accident, not a conspiracy. What do you think?\n\n\u2022 The introduction of a sinister-sounding company called Global Creation Associates can\u2019t help but make me think of Globo-Chem, the company at the heart of a classic Mr. Show sketch featuring Bob Odenkirk.\n\n\u2022 And based on their promotional video, Global Creation Associates\u2019 bafflingly vague line of products seems to include flying cars, rockets, clean water and air, medicines, energy systems, and bombs.\n\n\u2022 The list of people questioned in the break-in includes a slew of in-jokes, including Carmiel Banasky and Patrick Metcalf (who both worked on Undone), and Karen Joseph Adcock, Nick Barragan, Lorraine DeGraffenreidt, and Amy Schwartz (who all worked on Netflix\u2019s wonderful, unjustly canceled Tuca & Bertie, which shares some of the creative team behind Undone).\n\n\u2022 Alma on the simplicity of finding Darrold\u2019s home address: \u201cFinally, the internet\u2019s erosion of privacy works in my favor.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Sounds like the mustard bar at Becca and Reed\u2019s wedding is going to be extra grainy.
