And when asked what \"S\" stands for they revealed what\u2019s probably the most unusual and completely arbitrary name of all: \"It\u2019s Sharon.\"\n\nRoyal historian and writer, Hugo Vickers said \"it is highly likely\" that this is so. \"The purpose of any sobriquet is that it should be anonymous and memorable.\"\n\nWhile most everyone refers to Queen Elizabeth as \"Her Majesty\", according to Reader\u2019s Digest, close family used to refer to a young Princess Elizabeth as \"Lilibet\". Her Royal Highness couldn\u2019t pronounce her own name growing up, so the family would mimic the way she\u2019d refer to herself.\n\nEven that is somewhat more regal than Prince Philip\u2019s name for his wife though.\n\nIn the 2006 film The Queen it was revealed that the Duke of Edinburgh refers to his wife as \"Cabbage\".\n\n\"Move over, Cabbage,\" His Royal Highness is heard saying in the film when he asks the queen to shift over in bed.\n\nThe writer of the film, who is also the writer of The Crown, is well-versed in all things royal. Peter Morgan explained to The Times, \"I inquired in royal circles and was told on very good authority that that is what the duke sometimes calls the queen.\"\n\nReader\u2019s Digest explains the adorable nickname may come from \"mon petit chou\" - a French phrase for \"my darling\". In English, it translates to \"my little cabbage\".\n\nOf course, Prince George\u2019s nickname for the queen still takes the cake.\n\nAccording to the Duchess of Cambridge, the future king refers to the 93-year-old monarch as \"Gan-Gan\".", "description": "A new nickname for Queen Elizabeth to add to \"Lilibet\", \"Cabbage\" and \"Gan-Gan\".", "authors": ["Bashiera Parker", "Bparks_"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9418/8cfa0a5bf9ab4af585f161abb48c602b.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
