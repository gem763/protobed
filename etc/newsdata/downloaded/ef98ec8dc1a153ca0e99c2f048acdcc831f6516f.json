Trucking company failures more than tripled in the first half of 2019 from a year ago as the tide rushing out from last year\u2019s freight surge leaves some carriers financially vulnerable, the WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Jennifer Smith writes. The closures pulled more than 20,000 trucks from the road, according to Broughton Capital LLC, as truckers contend with softening demand and falling spot-market rates. The closures are taking out somewhat bigger operators than last year. But most are relatively small operators with regional footprints, and their demise could help the largest carriers gain more pricing power and control in the marketplace. In the biggest recent failure, Denver-based HVH Transportation Inc.\u2019s closure left about 150 drivers and their cargo stranded. The former CEO says he is working to get drivers home, and cites rising insurance rates as a factor.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nPressure for the maritime world to act more aggressively to cut emissions is growing. French President Emmanuel Macron is doubling down on his call for container-line operators to cut greenhouse gas emissions by reducing their speed on the water, the WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Costas Paris writes, ahead of a November meeting where international regulators are set to discuss the divisive tactic. Asian and South American nations in the International Maritime Organization aren\u2019t on board with France\u2019s \u201cslow steaming\u201d mandate, which has the backing of some European countries but would likely increase shipping times and transport costs. Maritime fuel consumption and CO2 emissions have dropped over the past decade as average vessel speeds slowed, but some say mandatory speed reductions would only delay investments in greener technologies in an industry that contributes up to 3% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution.\n\nChina is taking a magnifying glass to its tech-sector supply chains as the trade war with the U.S. intensifies. Beijing is canvassing smartphone maker Xiamoi Corp. and others on their reliance on American suppliers as it readies a retaliatory blacklist of foreign businesses. The WSJ\u2019s Yoko Kubota reports the exercise is part of a larger effort to wean China\u2019s supply chains off dependence on U.S. technology. American-made semiconductors, modems and jet engines are a mainstay for many Chinese companies whose dependence is drawing fresh attention as trade tensions surge. Washington barred U.S. companies from doing business with Chinese telecom gear maker ZTE Corp. last year, and the Beijing blacklist follows American efforts to shut out telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co. The survey demonstrates the care Beijing is taking to ensure local players don\u2019t become collateral damage in the trade war, but also reflects the fragility in China\u2019s economic outlook.\n\nThe Logistics Report won\u2019t publish on Monday, Sept. 2 because of the Labor Day holiday.
