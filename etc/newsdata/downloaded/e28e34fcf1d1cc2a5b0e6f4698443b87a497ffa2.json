Oumuamua sped past Earth and looped around our sun at 196,000 mph.\n\nThe object was almost half a mile long and so unusual that Nasa said it had \u2018never seen a natural object with such extreme proportions in the solar system before\u2019.\n\nSadly, the word \u2018natural\u2019 in that sentence shows that Nasa did not believe it was an alien spacecraft sent to investigate Earth.", "description": "The deep-space traveller is called 2I/Borisov and entered our solar system after a long, lonely journey through the void.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Interstellar-comet-0ad3_1570456306.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
