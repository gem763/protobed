Subscribe via Pocket Cast or iTunes.\n\nOswald Gruebel, who led both of Switzerland\u2019s two biggest banks during his career, criticized negative interest rates and argued they\u2019d lead to a further decline of the country\u2019s financial sector.\n\n\u201cNegative interest rates are crazy. That means money is not worth anything anymore,\u201d Gruebel said in an interview with Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag. \u201cAs long as we have negative interest rates, the financial industry will continue to shrink.\u201d\n\nGruebel served as Credit Suisse CEO from 2004 to 2007 and as UBS Group AG\u2019s top executive from 2009 to 2011.\n\nThe Swiss National Bank has used negative interest rates since 2015 to rein in an appreciation of the franc, arguing the policy -- together with a pledge to intervene in currency markets -- is crucial to protect the economy.\n\nYet banks are suffering. Credit Suisse plans to impose charges on more wealthy clients as it prepares to spread the pain of subzero rates, Bloomberg News reported in September.\n\nPolicy makers are aware of the burden. At their last meeting in September, they decided to offer banks additional relief by exempting a larger amount of their deposits from the charge. The move was seen as giving the SNB some leeway to cut rates further if needed.\n\nSpying Scandal\n\nIn the interview, Gruebel also addressed the spying scandal that has rocked the Swiss financial sector. He previously called for current Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam to step down over a decision to hire private detectives to trail the former head of wealth management Iqbal Khan as he was about to defect to UBS.\n\nCredit Suisse Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee resigned and assumed responsibility for ordering the spying, which Credit Suisse said \u201cresulted in severe reputational damage to the bank.\u201d Thiam, who has claimed he wasn\u2019t aware, was cleared of any responsibility in the scandal in a report commissioned by the bank.\n\nGruebel argued Credit Suisse\u2019s handling of the situation has hurt the standing of Switzerland as a banking hub.\n\n\u201cForeign media are bursting with glee,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cIn a business that above all requires expertise, there\u2019s nothing worse than to look ridiculous.\u201d\n\nSaving Face\n\nGruebel resigned from his post at UBS in 2011 shortly after it was revealed that a trader had lost $2 billion. He took the decision \u201cto save the bank\u2019s reputation,\u201d he told NZZ.\n\n\u201cThe CEO must take responsibility. In such incidents, the boss cannot blame anyone, even if he did not know it.\u201d\n\nIn response to a question whether Credit Suisse would be well advised to install a local at the top, Gruebel told NZZ that while it is helpful to have employees with global experience, Swiss banks are \u201cless global\u201d these days and \u201cit would make sense to use a Swiss CEO again.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Andy Hoffman in Geneva at ahoffman31@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Jana Randow, Rakteem Katakey\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.
