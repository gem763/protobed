A lot of people don\u2019t know how to do CPR correctly and what happens is that the brain becomes starved of oxygen which causes a loss of faculties in that person. So my decision was that I don\u2019t want to come back as a vegetable, and I decided I don\u2019t want to be resuscitated.\u201d\n\nThwaites, who also is an organ donor and has his blood type tattooed on his shoulder, said he watched his own father\u2019s health deteriorate, and he doesn\u2019t want to put his family through a similar plight.\n\nNURSE RETURNS TO WORK AT HOSPITAL WHERE SHE WAS TREATED FOR LEUKEMIA AS CHILD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about quality of life, sometimes it\u2019s about the quality of someone\u2019s death too,\u201d he said.\n\nDNR tattoos pose an ethical and legal dilemma for health care providers, especially in the U.S., as DNR laws typically vary state-by-state and must be signed by a doctor. England has similar laws, and according to Keep Calm and Talk Law, the National Health Service (NHS) would likely \u201cbe obliged to refuse to honor a DNR tattoo,\u201d unless it complied with the standards for a living will. Honoring the tattoo without a witness signature and patient signature could cause a doctor to lose his medical license, or be sued by the patient\u2019s family or estate. Still, the topic remains open to debate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor Thwaites, he said that in addition to the tattoo, he has made a living will.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a living will, and I think the tattoo is one of those things that you hope you never have to use,\u201d he told SWNS.", "description": "The tattoo is an ethical and legal dilemma for most health care professionals.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/th-inking-twice-422249.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
