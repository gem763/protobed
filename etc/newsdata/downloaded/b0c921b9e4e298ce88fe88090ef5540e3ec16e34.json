Rene Gagnon, as had long been believed, but Cpl. Harold P. Keller, the Marines said in a statement, noting that Gagnon did help obtain the flag.\n\nAssociated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal shot the iconic photograph atop Mount Suribachi during the 1945 battle between American and Japanese forces on Iwo Jima.\n\n\"Regardless of who was in the photograph, each and every Marine who set foot on Iwo Jima, or supported the effort from the sea and air around the island is, and always will be, a part of our Corps' cherished history,\" the Marines said in the statement.\n\nIn 2016, the Marines corrected the identity of another man in the photo after historians raised questions.\n\nUS Marines of the 28th Regiment, 5th Division, raise the US flag atop Mt. Suribachi on Iwo Jima, February 23, 1945. Associated Press\n\nNBC News, which broke the news on the Marines' decision, reported that Keller died in 1979 in Grinnell, Iowa. The Marines didn't provide details about Keller, but NBC interviewed his 70-year-old daughter, Kay Maurer, of Brooklyn, Iowa.\n\nAlthough Maurer said her father kept a framed Rosenthal photo showing 18 Marines on the summit of Mount Suribachi with the flag in the background, he never mentioned his role in the historic event.\n\n\"He never spoke about any of this when we were growing up,\" she said. \"We knew he fought in the war. We knew he was wounded in the shoulder at one point. ... But he didn't tell us he helped raise the flag on Mount Suribachi.\"\n\nMaurer said that when she would ask her father about the photo, \"he would say something like, 'That group raised a flag.'\"\n\nThe Battle of Iwo Jima began on February 19, 1945, and lasted 36 days, with about 70,000 Marines fighting 18,000 Japanese soldiers. More than 6,500 US servicemen died and about 20,000 were wounded in the battle on the tiny island, which is about 660 miles south of Tokyo and is now officially called Iwo To.\n\nMost of the Japanese soldiers were killed.\n\nThe island was seen as vital to the war effort because Japanese fighter planes based there were intercepting American bombers.\n\nAmphibious vehicles bogged down on the beaches of Iwo Jima, February 1945. Associated Press\n\nRosenthal shot the photo on February 23, 1945, amid continuing fighting. He didn't get the men's names, but after the photo was celebrated in the US, President Franklin Roosevelt told the military to identify the flag raisers.\n\nThe Marines identified the men as John Bradley, Rene Gagnon, Ira Hayes, Harlon Block, Michael Strank and Franklin Sousley. All were Marines except for Bradley, who was a Navy corpsman.\n\nAfter two amateur historians raised questions about the identities, a Marine panel in 2016 found that a flag raiser long believed to be Navy Pharmacist's Mate 2nd Class John Bradley was actually Pfc. Harold Schultz, of Detroit. Bradley had helped in an earlier flag-raising on Mount Suribachi, and his role took on greater significance after his son, James Bradley, wrote a best-selling book about the flag raisers, \"Flags of Our Fathers,\" that was later made into a movie directed by Clint Eastwood.\n\nThe latest questions were raised by historians Stephen Foley, Dustin Spence and Brent Westemeyer. Their findings were confirmed by a board that was formed by the Marines and was aided by FBI investigators. Foley was also one of the historians who noted the previous mistaken identity.\n\nThe Marines noted that Gagnon played a significant role that day. After an initial flag raising, he was responsible for bringing the second, larger flag to the mountaintop, which is the flag depicted in the photo, and returning the first flag for safekeeping.\n\n\"Without his efforts, this historical event might not have been captured, let alone even occurred,\" the Marines said.", "description": "The Marine Corps has corrected the identity of another of the men who were photographed raising the American flag at Iwo Jima during World War II.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da9ed904af909545e526036?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
