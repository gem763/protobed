The Association of British Travel Agents recommends you always check the small print of any policy, but lists a number of common travel insurance exceptions: - Incidents that occur after drinking too much or taking drugs - Theft of unattended possessions - Sports, extreme sports and some leisure activities such as skiing, white water rafting or bungee jumping - Medical treatment resulting from existing medical conditions that you have not declared - Medical costs incurred if you stay abroad after your doctor advises you are fit to return to the UK - Strikes and industrial action, if the date of the strike/industrial action was known when you booked your trip - Rescheduled flights, where the airline has cancelled and then rescheduled your flight - Travel to destinations where the FCO advises against all but essential travel\n\nUnder EU law you are entitled to a lump sum of \u20ac250 if your arrival time is delayed by more than three hours, if your flight is short-haul (up to 1,500km), and \u20ac400 if your flight is medium-haul (up to 3,500km).\n\nYou would be paid \u20ac600 if your flight is further than 3,500km and delayed four hours.\n\nThe flight must have departed from an EU airport and operated by any airline, or it must be arriving into an EU airport and be operated by an EU airline.\n\nAn 'EU airport' also includes the following countries; Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\n\nYour flight home from Greece was delayed by more than eight hours.\n\nIf a short-haul or medium-haul flight is delayed by more than two hours, you must be provided a reasonable amount of food and drink, the means for you to communicate, accommodation overnight if needed and transport to it.\n\nYou can also claim back any reasonable costs you spent on food, drink or other necessities if you're delayed by this amount of time.\n\nHowever, while you might think you should have a fairly open-and-shut case, there is a big catch.\n\nAirlines can turn down claims if 'extraordinary circumstances' apply. These are judged to be thinks outside of its control and that it could not reasonably plan for, such as acts of terrorism, an sudden air traffic control strike, or extreme weather conditions.\n\nIn this instance, you might think that Thomas Cook delaying your flight by virtue of it going bust was its fault and that its long documented troubles should have been reasonably planned for.\n\nBut even if that argument did wash, compensation claims must be made to the airline, which in Thomas Cook's case has gone into compulsory liquidation and no longer exists.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority told This is Money that as you returned on a repatriation flight, you are 'certainly not' entitled to any compensation.\n\nBritish holidaymakers were stranded abroad after Thomas Cook went bust. The British Government has put on repatriation flights but some have been severely delayed\n\nAm I due a refund for the tickets I bought?\n\nNow let's turn to the issue of whether you are owed a refund.\n\nThe Association of British Insurers in a Q&A on its website says if you have only booked a flight, 'travel disruption cover can pay for additional overseas accommodation costs incurred if you decide to arrange a return flight home yourself'.\n\nIt adds: 'If you have travel disruption or scheduled airline failure cover, then you may be able to reclaim any additional costs while waiting to be repatriated, from your travel insurer, if these are not recoverable from another source.'\n\nOf course, these answers address the question of supplementary costs but not the flight home you paid for.\n\nThat requires a closer look at your policy documents. You told This is Money that you bought Sainsbury's Bank Single Trip Gold Travel Insurance on 13 September this year, having booked your flights a month earlier.\n\nThe insurance has sections on both travel disruption cover and financial failure cover, both of which are key sections when looking at insurance which might cover you if an airline goes bust.\n\nHowever, travel disruption cover does not cover you, as you have not had your trip cut short, had your accommodation substituted, or had your return 'date' delayed.\n\nThe section on financial failure states that if an airline fails before your departure you will be paid out any 'irrecoverable sums paid prior to the financial failure of the scheduled airline you are booked with' up to \u00a32,500.\n\nIf it fails after your outbound flight, as in your case, you are covered up to the same value for any 'additional costs incurred by you in replacing that part of the flight to a similar standard'.\n\nAgain, because you were flown home by a flight chartered by the British Government and did not have to pay for a replacement flight, you will be unlikely to be covered under this section.\n\nThe section also includes a disclaimer that it will not pay out any costs resulting from the failure of any airline in any case where the failure or the looming prospect of it was widely known to the public at the time you bought the policy. While Thomas Cook was known to be in financial difficulty and seeking a rescue, it would probably be unfair to suggest you knew it was going to go bust imminently.\n\nPassengers talk to a British embassy official at Ioannis Kapodistrias Airport in Corfu, Greece, on Monday after Thomas Cook went into liquidation\n\nWhat about a credit card refund?\n\nThe route likeliest to bear fruit might be the provider of the credit card you used to book the flights on 13 August \u2013 in your case Sainsbury's.\n\nIf you have bought flights that cost between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000 on a credit card, then under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act you can make a claim to your credit card provider for a refund if an airline goes under and fails to provide you with the flight.\n\nUnder the 1974 act, a credit card company is as liable for any breach of contract or misrepresentation by a retailer as the retailer.\n\nSuch a claim requires you to have booked through Thomas Cook directly and not a third-party.\n\nYou can also claim back accommodation and food expenses provided they are reasonable.\n\nFor this, make sure you go to the card provider, Sainsbury's Bank, rather than the issuer be it Visa, Mastercard or American Express.\n\nThis would appear to be the likeliest route for you to go down to get a refund on the flights you booked, however, there is a suggestion that those who have been repatriated are not eligible to claim money back under Section 75.\n\nThis is because they were provided with a flight - even if it was heavily delayed.\n\nUK Finance, the trade body which represents credit card providers and other financial companies, said: 'Customers who have been repatriated under the Government/CAA scheme will not be able to claim an additional refund on their original flight tickets bought with Thomas Cook under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act as they would have received a return flight.'", "description": "Do I have the right to claim back the original cost of my cancelled flights from my credit card company or insurance provider, and am I entitled to any compensation for the delay?", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
