It\u2019s one of the great perversions of his administration: that a president so undeserving of fealty and protection gets a magnitude of it \u2014 from congressional Republicans, from Steve Mnuchin, from Bill Barr, from Wilbur Ross, now from Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence \u2014 that worthier predecessors in the White House didn\u2019t.\n\nPart of what could be called the Corey Lewandowski trap is Democrats\u2019 failure to accept this. Part of it is their assumption that Trump\u2019s cocky comrades would hesitate to display the garish public colors that they do. But those colors are much of what the president\u2019s supporters like and what fires them up. They embrace Trump as someone who raises a middle finger to propriety, to elites and to the establishment, because they somehow don\u2019t see him as part of that crowd and because they deem that gesture necessary and courageous. So Lewandowski happily mimicked it, not just at the hearing but also the morning after, during an interview with CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota, when he inaccurately described Mueller\u2019s report while blithely conceding that he hadn\u2019t read it.", "description": "", "authors": ["Frank Bruni", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday Corey-Lewandowski-Testimony.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
