The answer is yes \u2014 because we still haven't admitted his misogyny", "language": "en", "text": "One day in the summer of 1979, Circuit Court Judge Edward Cowart sentenced a grey-suit-clad Ted Bundy to death for his \u201cextremely wicked, shockingly evil, vile\u201d crimes. After informing Bundy that he would be \u201cput to death by a current of electricity, sufficient to cause your immediate death\u201d, Cowart looked up from his notes and saw fit to tell the serial murderer: \u201cYou're a bright young man. You'd have made a good lawyer and I would have loved to have you practice in front of me, but you went another way, partner. I don't feel any animosity toward you. I want you to know that. Take care of yourself.\u201d\n\nCowart\u2019s infamous remarks make for a striking embodiment of Bundy\u2019s entire Florida trial. All eyes were on the man who would ultimately confess to killing at least 30 women across seven states (the actual death toll could be higher). The youngest known victim was a 12-year-old girl. But Cowart couldn't bring himself to hate Bundy; instead, he mourned his loss of potential.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, Bundy seemed to revel in the theatricality of the court system. Despite being appointed attorneys, he insisted on defending himself. He proposed to his girlfriend, Carole Ann Boone, during a court session, and took advantage of a Florida law to declare both of them legally married, since the \u201cvows\u201d had been exchanged in front of court officers in an open courtroom (as outlined by the true-crime writer Ann Rule in the definitive Bundy book The Stranger Beside Me).\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Their crimes are so violent, so unimaginable, so beyond the normal boundaries of human behaviour that they require our undivided attention. And whenever serial killers are discussed, they inevitably end up being the centre of the narrative. The secondary players in their lives \u2013 their partners, their relatives, even the victims \u2013 fade into the background, often becoming little more than placeholders or stereotypes.\n\nBut an upcoming Amazon series is attempting to shift our perspective, diverting it away from Bundy and onto the women in his story. As announced earlier this week, Ted Bundy: Falling For a Killer will feature groundbreaking interviews with Bundy\u2019s former girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall and her daughter Molly. Kendall was involved in a relationship with Bundy for several years in the Seventies; indeed, Bundy partly raised Molly, who was a child at the time. This is the first time Kendall will speak out publicly in four decades. She authored a book about her relationship with Bundy, titled The Phantom Prince: My Life with Ted Bundy, in 1981, which has been out of print for years (the cheapest copies currently available on Amazon cost around $173) and is being republished in January.\n\n\"Ted Bundy: Falling for a Killer reframes Bundy\u2019s crimes from a female perspective \u2013 uncovering the disturbing and profound way in which Bundy\u2019s pathological hatred of women collided with the culture wars and feminist movement of the 1970s, culminating in what is perhaps the most infamous true-crime saga of our time,\u201d Amazon\u2019s description of the new series reads in part. The programme, which is being produced and directed by the investigative journalist Trish Wood, will include a \u201cchorus of female voices\u201d, including some who survived attacks by the killer.\n\nOne might wonder if more Ted Bundy content was what we needed in our current cultural landscape. The past year alone has seen the release of Conversations With a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes, a four-part Netflix documentary documenting Bundy\u2019s crimes, capture and sentencing, and the biopic Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile, in which Bundy is portrayed by Zac Efron (Kendall, who features prominently as a character, is played by Lily Collins). But despite those recent releases, the truth is that yes, we desperately need a docu-series such as Falling For a Killer, which seems to set out to do what so few true-crime productions have done: address the misogyny behind a serial murderer\u2019s impulses.\n\nNaturally, there\u2019s no telling whether the show actually accomplishes those things until it\u2019s released, but its premise highlights a shift that is desperately needed in the true-crime genre. It\u2019s really quite amazing how rarely the words \u201cpathological hatred of women\u201d are written or uttered even when the man at the centre of the conversation murdered and/or sexually assaulted dozens of them.\n\nThis applies to other types of killers too: this week, people in France (where I am from) collectively gasped as it was reported that Xavier Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s, a man suspected of murdering his wife and four children in 2011, had been arrested at Glasgow Airport. The arrest turned out to be a spectacular mistake \u2014 the man in question simply bore a passing resemblance to de Ligonn\u00e8s \u2014 but in the hours after the original news broke, social media users were collectively rejoicing at the thought that de Ligonn\u00e8s, who has been missing for eight years, had been located. Amid a sea of memes and quips, I only saw one tweet acknowledging the gravity of the still-unsolved killings. It\u2019s also worth noting that family slayings such as the one de Ligonn\u00e8s is suspected of tend to happen after a campaign of domestic violence.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to cast a judgemental eye on true-crime enthusiasts or anyone who takes a casual interest in a real-life murder case (I have spent way too much time Googling various cases and listening to various podcasts for that). But if we\u2019re going to take interest in the tales of violent killers such as Bundy, then it\u2019s vital to acknowledge the gendered nature of their crimes.\n\nConversations with a Killer The Ted Bundy Tapes trailer\n\nMost of the time, when Bundy\u2019s are discussed, two things can happen. In the best-case scenario, Bundy is depicted as a sociopath or a psychopath, or perhaps both or neither, and dismissed as someone not worthy of attention (fair enough). The worst-case scenario is when the conversation turns to Bundy\u2019s supposed \u201cgood looks\u201d (to me, he looks like a thirty- or forty-something creep in most photos, but then again, hindsight is 20/20). Something that almost never happens, however, is an in-depth discussion of the women in his life \u2013 his victims, the lives he took, the trauma he inflicted on those who survived, the mother who testified after he was convicted of murder in an attempt to spare him the death penalty, and Kendall herself (who tried to bring Bundy to investigators\u2019 attention during his killing spree, to no avail).\n\nA man who brutally attacks and kills at least 30 women over the course of his 42-year life is first and foremost a misogynist with a deep-seated hatred of women. This shouldn\u2019t have to be said, but it\u2019s a necessary acknowledgment in 2019. If a new Bundy docu-series is what it takes to accomplish that, then it\u2019s a necessary and welcome addition.
