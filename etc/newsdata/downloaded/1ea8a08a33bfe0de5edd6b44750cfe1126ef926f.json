But the word he would describe himself as is \u201clucky\u201d. The reason? Because of what he saw when he recently met up with his old football contemporaries Stan Bowles and Frank Worthington, both in the advanced stages of dementia.\n\n\u201cI thought when I first found out about Stan, he owed so many people money gambling, it was his get-out. I really wish it was that, God bless him,\u201d Hudson says, as he sits in one of his several favourite west London pubs, cradling a pint or two of lunchtime cider. \u201cFrank, too. When he left the pub he left a tenner on the table. In it was wrapped this piece of paper that his wife had written the instructions for him how to get home. It broke my heart to see them like that. Made me think, \u2018How lucky are you to still have your marbles?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd, though he might have lost most of the trappings that came with being once reckoned the smartest footballing talent in the country, Hudson is, without doubt, still in full possession of his marbles. To spend a lunchtime in his company is to be regaled with acid anecdotes from his time in the game, several of which, if repeated here, would keep libel lawyers in work for months. A man of strong opinions \u2013 Don Revie, Alf Ramsey, Dave Sexton and Terry Neill among those he dismisses as hopeless, hapless and vindictive \u2013 his career was pockmarked with rows and fallings-out.", "description": "Alan Hudson has been bankrupt and homeless, has been estranged from his son, has spent 50 days in a coma, has endured prostate cancer and epilepsy, walks with a permanent limp and bears the scars from some 60 operations.", "authors": ["Jim White", "Sam Dean", "Jamie Carragher", "Fiona Tomas"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000213793836-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqz8PrEBUoq2NOeDT9dFlgS5zo8_eVaYsgfgaGHBq6Cl8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
