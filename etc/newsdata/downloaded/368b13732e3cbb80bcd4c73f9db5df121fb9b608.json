But in the long term it is something we need to do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the journey we were expecting but in the long term we are going to look back and it is going to be worth it.\u201d\n\nFollowing the demise of the CWHL, which operated six franchises including one in China, the United States based National Women\u2019s Hockey League (NWHL) was left as the only professional option in North America. It has just five teams.\n\nLIVABLE WAGES\n\nWith each team working with a salary cap of $150,000 split between rosters of 20-22 players, even the NWHL cannot deliver on the stability and livable wages players are seeking.\n\nIn contrast, the average wage of an NHL player runs into the millions.\n\nBelieving they had reached a point where they had to take a stand, players announced the formation of the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey Players Association\u2019s (PWHPA) in May with nearly 200 of the game\u2019s best vowing to sit out the current season to support the creation of a viable professional league.\n\n\u201cDefinitely there is an opportunity for a very viable league,\u201d said Melody Davidson, who coached Canada to gold in Vancouver and continues to work for Hockey Canada as head scout for the national team program.\n\n\u201cI think right now everybody is like what do we want to do here, does anyone want to take the lead on it, what does it look like?\n\n\u201cIt is going to take some time.\u201d\n\nHow long the game\u2019s best players will hold out remains to be seen.\n\nPWHPA members have pledged not to join any professional North American league until an economically viable option emerges but there is little evidence of any significant progress towards that objective.\n\nJayna Hefford, a four-time Olympic gold medallist for Canada who was serving as interim commissioner of the CWHL when in folded, is now working in a leadership position with PWHPA and says talks with various stakeholders are ongoing.\n\nBut the Hockey Hall of Famer conceded that there is no timeline to see a concrete plan put on the table.\n\n\u201cIt is uncertain times but we are making progress and moving forward,\u201d assured Hefford. \u201cIt takes time to create change.\n\n\u201cSince the CWHL folded there has been great conversation around what needs to happen, how does it need to be supported and what does it need to look like and what kind of things do the players need to make sure this is a long term solution.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think anyone knows the timeline.\u201d", "description": "Many of Canada's top women's ice hockey players are using golden memories to help them through the dark days as the fight to rebuild a fractured sport drags on with no end in sight.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444907397&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1BT-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
