The marketer overseeing the project, Frito-Lay Vice President of Marketing Sadira Furlow, brought a personal touch to this campaign. The inspiration came from her dad showing up with a bag of Fritos for his first date with her mom more than 50 years ago, according to the company.\n\nThis slice of life approach is a far cry from the previous star of the Fritos commercials who came complete with a peppy jingle. Dubbed \"The Frito Bandito,\" it was an animated character featured in spots from 1967 to 1971. \"The Bandito\" was created by the famed ad agency Foote, Cone & Belding and the talent behind the character was a powerhouse of cartoons at the time. Tex Avery of \"Looney Toons\" fame and the man behind such characters as Porky Pig directed the spots and they were voiced by his colleague, the legendary Mel \"Bugs Bunny\" Blanc. For the voice of the \"Bandito\" Blanc used an exaggerated Mexican accent and the cartoon featured an unkempt, unshaven figure.\n\nWhile the chips may have been in good taste, some thought the commercials were not. In 1968, two Mexican-American advocacy groups -- the National Mexican-American Anti-Defamation Committee in Washington, D.C. and the Involvement of Mexican-Americans in Gainful Endeavors (IMAGE) in San Antonio, Texas \u2013 voiced complaints about the stereotype portrayed in the commercials. Some changes were made to the spots but within three years, \"The Frito Bandito\" was discontinued.\n\nFor its new campaign, Frito-Lay says it is planning for a significant investment through the end of the year across YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest. Frito-Lay is also working on a partnership with Hormel Chili that kicks off in November \u2013 the heart of the NFL and college football seasons \u2013 that will include co-branded recipes and in-store displays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFritos recently partnered with the Carry The Load initiative, as they produced nearly 22 million special bags to honor the sacrifices made by America\u2019s war heroes. That number represented the total members who have served in the military (including active-duty) since records began, and that includes active-duty service members.\n\nAlong with that, Fritos\u2019 parent company, PepsiCo, donated $100,000 to Carry The Load to support its ongoing efforts to provide healing services via non-profit partners for the mind, body and soul of warriors.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Fritos-products.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
