Within \u201cseconds,\u201d the 12-year-old said, she was pushed down, her hands held behind her back as the boys called her names and cut off patches of her \u201cugly, nappy\u201d dreadlocks.\n\n\u201cOne of the boys put his hand over my mouth so I wouldn\u2019t scream while they used scissors on my hair,\u201d she recalled to The Daily Beast on Thursday. \"They were all laughing calling me ugly and saying I should have never been born.\u201d\n\nThe alleged assault only lasted \u201ca minute or two\u201d before the bell rang to signal the end of recess, the sixth grader said. The three boys took off running to go into their math class while Amari stayed on the slide, trying to collect herself before following behind.\n\n\u201cThey ran off laughing and I was just sitting there,\u201d the soft-spoken teenager said. \u201cI\u2019m hurt that it happened. All I want to ask them is: Why?\u201d\n\nThe Monday afternoon racist attack at the private Virginia Christian school\u2014an already controversial school where Karen Pence, the second lady of the United States, teaches art class part-time\u2014has \u201cdestroyed\u201d the Allen family, and they are now seeking legal and administrative retributions.\n\nAmari\u2019s mother, Cynthia Allen, told The Daily Beast that the family met with school officials on Thursday morning to demand the three boys be removed and updated policies be put into place to ensure \u201cthis doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Allen also said Amari filed a police report.\n\n\u201cWe take seriously the emotional and physical well-being of all our students, and have a zero-tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse. We are deeply disturbed by the allegations being made, and are in communication with the family of the alleged victim to gather information and provide whatever support we can,\u201d the school said in a statement to The Daily Beast. \u201cWe have also reached out to law enforcement to ask them to conduct a thorough investigation, and further inquiries should be directed to the Fairfax County Police Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I am asking for is this to be resolved, if they can\u2019t leave school then I will,\u201d Amari said. Her mother agreed, adding: \u201cShe\u2019s in real pain but she wants justice.\u201d\n\nThe 53-year-old mom said it took two days for Amari to finally admit the attack even happened. At first, the 12-year-old told her mother that the missing parts of her hair were the result of playing \u201cbeauty salon\u201d with another friend.\n\n\u201cWe continued to press her on it because it just didn\u2019t sound like something she would do,\u201d Cynthia Allen said. \u201cThen she started breaking down crying, trembling, and shaking before telling us what happened.\u201d\n\nAmari said she \u201cinstantly felt better\u201d when she told her family about how the three sixth-grade boys pinned her down on the playground. She said while one boy covered her mouth, a second boy put her hands behind her back, and a third boy cut her dreadlocks while calling her names.\n\n\u201cThey called her \u2018ugly,\u2019 told her she was an \u2018attention seeker,\u2019 called her hair \u2018nappy,\u2019 all of these horrible things,\u201d her mother said. \u201cAnd when they ran away laughing, she just had to sit there and get herself together.\u201d\n\nAmari admitted she initially denied that anyone cut her hair out of fear of retaliation. The three boys\u2014including one that used to be her friend\u2014are in six of her classes and she said she was afraid they \u201cwould come after me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey had scissors, so they could have done anything to me,\u201d the sixth grader said. \u201cI was afraid if I told the teacher they wouldn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nAmari\u2019s mom explained that this was not the first time her daughter had been subjected to bullying by these three classmates. Throughout the school year, the boys have allegedly been \u201ctaking her lunch every single day and calling her names.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy concern is, how did they not see what was taking place, on the playground and all year,\u201d Allen said. \u201cKaren Pence, the vice president\u2019s wife, works at the school. There is security and secret service everywhere. How did they not know!\u201d\n\nThe Immanuel Christian School, which enrolls kindergartners through eighth graders at its campus in Springfield, Virginia, has been previously embroiled in controversy after its school banned LGBT students and demanded all employees affirm the belief that marriage should only be between a man and a woman.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the school\u2019s employment application requires prospective teachers to describe their faith and sign their initials next to a list of beliefs, including Immanuel Christian\u2019s definition of marriage and stances on sexual identity.\n\n\u201cI understand that the term \u2018marriage\u2019 has only one meaning; the uniting of one man and one woman,\u201d the application reads, detailing that certain \u201cmoral misconduct\u201d considered disqualifying includes \u201cheterosexual activity outside of marriage (e.g., premarital sex, cohabitation, extramarital sex), homosexual or lesbian sexual activity, polygamy, transgender identity, any other violation of the unique roles of male and female.\u201d\n\nPence, 62, has had a long history with the school, having taught from 2001 to 2013 while her husband served in Congress. And in December, the second lady decided to return twice a week to the private school as an art teacher.\n\nCynthia Allen said despite the school\u2019s recent controversies, she is more concerned with its future and said she is planning to speak to administrators further about preventing another racist attack.\n\nBut for now, she said, Amari will not return to school.\n\n\u201cAmari is surviving but this can\u2019t happen again,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is terrified, she has not been able to sleep. And she is strong, I can\u2019t imagine if this happened to somebody else.\u201d", "description": "The alleged assailants called the 12-year-old girl\u2019s hair \u201cugly\u201d and \u201cnappy\u201d while attacking her during recess at Immanuel Christian School\u2014where Karen Pence currently teaches art.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569520631/190926-melendez-girls-dreads-cut-hero_a5bmmu", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
