Even so, the crowd of vegans who gathered in central London earlier this year are unlikely to forget the moment when Gatis Lagzdins skinned and ate a raw squirrel.\n\nAlong with his co-conspirator Deonisy Khlebnikov, Lagzdins performed his stunt at the weekly Soho Vegan Market on Rupert Street. He would subsequently demonstrate at VegFest in Brighton (although this time his snack of choice was a raw pig\u2019s head) as part of a self-proclaimed \u201ccarnivore tour\u201d intended to highlight the evils of a plant-based diet. At the London event, he wore a black vest emblazoned with the slogan: \u201cVeganism = Malnutrition.\u201d\n\nThe war on vegans started small. There were flashpoints, some outrageous enough to receive press coverage. There was the episode in which William Sitwell, then editor of Waitrose magazine, resigned after a freelance writer leaked an email exchange in which he joked about \u201ckilling vegans one by one\u201d. (Sitwell has since apologised.) There was the PR nightmare faced by Natwest bank when a customer calling to apply for a loan was told by an employee that \u201call vegans should be punched in the face\u201d. When animal rights protesters stormed into a Brighton Pizza Express in September this year, one diner did exactly that.\n\nA charge commonly laid against vegans is that they relish their status as victims, but research suggests they have earned it. In 2015, a study conducted by Cara C MacInnis and Gordon Hodson for the journal Group Processes & Intergroup Relations observed that vegetarians and vegans in western society \u2013 and vegans in particular \u2013 experience discrimination and bias on a par with ethnic and religious minorities.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Lee Martin/Guardian Design\n\nOnce a niche interest group parodied in TV shows such as The Simpsons (in which a character describes himself as a \u201clevel five vegan\u201d who refuses to eat anything that casts a shadow), in the past two years, vegans have been thrust into the limelight. A philosophy rooted in non-aggression has found itself at the heart of some of the most virulent arguments on social media. In November 2018, Good Morning Britain hosted a debate titled \u201cDo people hate vegans?\u201d; the political website Vox tackled the question in even more direct fashion a week later, asking: \u201cWhy do people hate vegans so much?\u201d\n\nThese recent displays of enmity towards vegans represent a puzzling escalation in hostilities, just as a consensus is starting to form that eating less meat would almost certainly be better for everyone \u2013 and the Earth. Of course, eating less meat does not mean eating no meat whatsoever, and the extreme prohibitions associated with going vegan (no animal products, no eggs, no leather, no wool) suggest it could have been just another Atkins diet or clean-eating fad \u2013 a flash in the pan that blows up and then dissipates, leaving behind nothing more than a dose of mild regret. Instead, just when the growth might have been expected to plateau, it kept on growing. A 2016 Ipsos Mori survey suggested the total number of vegans in the UK had increased more than 360% in the preceding decade, to more than 500,000.\n\nBig business has been quick to cash in. The Los Angeles-based company Beyond Meat, producer of plant-based burgers whose taste and texture are as much like minced beef as possible, recently went public and soon afterwards hit a valuation of $3.4bn; huge conglomerates such as Nestl\u00e9 and Kellogg\u2019s are moving into the fake-meat market; supermarkets and restaurant chains have introduced vegan ranges. Yet perhaps the definitive proof of veganism\u2019s mainstreaming \u2013 and the backlash against it \u2013 came in January this year, when the beloved high-street bakery chain Greggs announced it was launching a Quorn-based vegan sausage roll. It was pilloried by Piers Morgan, who tweeted: \u201cNobody was waiting for a vegan bloody sausage, you PC-ravaged clowns.\u201d It turns out Morgan was mistaken: the vegan sausage roll was such a hit that the company\u2019s share value leapt by 13%.\n\nOf course, what we grow, harvest, fatten and kill is political. A Tesco advert showcasing vegan produce met protests from the National Farmers Union who claimed it \u201cdemonised\u201d meat, while Shropshire deputy council leader Steve Charmley unleashed a tweet-storm when confronted with pro-vegan advertising in a county he claimed was \u201cbuilt on agriculture\u201d. This moment, and this conflict, were a long time coming. The rise of veganism is a question less of personal taste than of generational upheaval; less about meat and fish and dairy than the systems that put them on our tables in such excessive quantities. Ultimately, the vegan wars are not really about veganism at all, but about how individual freedom is coming into conflict with a personal and environmental health crisis.\n\nIn many cultures, the practice of abstaining entirely from animal produce has an established history: with their belief systems rooted in nonviolence, many Rastafarians, followers of Jainism and certain sects of Buddhism have been swearing off meat, fish, eggs and dairy for centuries. In large swathes of the west, though, public awareness of what veganism actually entails has been sketchy. There wasn\u2019t even a commonly accepted English-language name until 1944, when a British woodworker called Donald Watson called a meeting with a handful of other non-dairy vegetarians (including his wife, Dorothy) to discuss a less cumbersome label for their lifestyle. They considered alternatives such as dairyban, vitan and benevore before settling on the term we use today, a simple contraction of vegetarian on the grounds that \u201cveganism starts with vegetarianism and carries it through to its logical conclusions\u201d.\n\nBut those logical conclusions did not stop at abstaining from certain foods. The original vegans were not pursuing a diet so much as a belief system, a wholesale ideology \u2013 one that rejected not just animal protein but also the way animals had become part of an industrial supply chain. In the 1970s, Carol J Adams started work on the book that would appear, two decades later, as The Sexual Politics of Meat: a seminal feminist text that positioned veganism as the only logical solution to a social system that reduced both women and animals to desirable, but disposable, flesh.\n\nIn the early 70s, other activists were considering how veganism might provide a viable alternative to existing food systems. In 1971, Diet for a Small Planet by the social policy activist Frances Moore Lapp\u00e9 introduced an environmental justification for going vegetarian or vegan to a global audience (it eventually sold more than 3m copies). In the same year, counter-culture hero Stephen Gaskin founded a vegan intentional community, The Farm, in Lewis County, Tennessee, bringing together some 300 like-minded individuals. Four years later, The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook by Louise Hagler announced: \u201cWe are vegetarians because one-third of the world is starving and at least half goes to bed hungry every night,\u201d and introduced western audiences to techniques for making their own soy-based products such as tofu and tempeh.\n\nThe Farm Vegetarian Cookbook fixed a certain vegan aesthetic in the minds of mainstream meat-eating culture for decades to come. Veganism became synonymous with soybeans and brown rice, with ageing hippies spooning beige bowlfuls of worthy grains and pulses \u2013 not the glamorous, vibrant, youthful practitioners that now radiate positivity from their Instagram feeds.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest BBQ pulled jack fruit tacos with avocado and lime: a long way from the beige vegan food much parodied in the 70s. Photograph: LauriPatterson/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nIt is hard to overstate the role social media has played in transforming veganism\u2019s image, with its facility for fostering an instant sense of community. Witness any number of viral internet phenomena \u2013 from Woman Laughing Alone with Salad to acai bowls and this generation\u2019s staple, avocado toast \u2013 that have helped free it from its musty old associations. Instagram in particular gave vegan food mainstream exposure, repackaging it (good for you and photogenic!) for the low-attention-span internet age. Not everyone sees this as a positive development: the vegan writer and podcast host Alicia Kennedy considers it troubling that the internet has transformed something with such a rich political history into \u201ca wellness thing\u201d that allows would-be consumers to label themselves vegans without having to engage with the \u201cexcess baggage\u201d of ideology. Another American writer, Khushbu Shah, has argued that the popularisation of veganism via social media has erased non-white faces and narratives from the dominant discourse, as white bloggers and influencers fashion a lifestyle in their image.\n\nAt the same time, a similar transformation was happening to the food vegans were eating. A blossoming street food scene in major cities influenced a dirtier, trashier vegan aesthetic that gave the diet a further boost. Recipe channels on YouTube and Facebook such as BOSH! \u2013 a glossy young male duo \u2013 used video to make stunt dishes (apple pie tacos; a plant-based take on a McDonald\u2019s McMuffin; a watermelon \u201cJaegerbomb\u201d) that injected some much-needed fun into the diet. (Tellingly, the BOSH! dudes, Henry Firth and Ian Theasby, refer to themselves not as chefs but \u201cfood remixers\u201d.)\n\nThe language began to reflect a new, more approachable veganism. Descriptors such as \u201cplant-based\u201d gained in popularity, effectively rebranding the worthy brown stodge of popular imagination into something green and vital. Other neologisms such as \u201cflexitarian\u201d (a term denoting someone who is predominantly vegan or vegetarian but who occasionally eats meat or fish, added to the Oxford English Dictionary in June 2014) recast daunting vegan ideology as a fun, healthy, casual thing to try.\n\nCultish initiatives like Veganuary (an annual campaign encouraging people to go meat-free for the first month of the year, launched in 2014) and Meat Free Mondays tapped into this spirit \u2013 moving away from wholesale dietary transformation and towards something more manageably sporadic, with the added gloss of being able to share (that is, brag about) the experience online. Beyonc\u00e9 declared an interest in veganism \u2013 at least, for breakfast \u2013 while athletes such as Venus Williams (who took up a raw vegan diet to combat a health condition) and Lewis Hamilton played a vital role in raising awareness and turning something once seen as weird and a little annoying into a desirable lifestyle.\n\nGet the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n\nHelping the cause was the growing body of scientific literature suggesting that some of the processes that produce the modern western diet were catastrophically bad for us. Bee Wilson wrote in these pages about the health effects of processed pork in a piece titled \u201cYes, bacon really is killing us.\u201d Food in the Anthropocene, a report commissioned by the Lancet in conjunction with the global nonprofit Eat (a startup dedicated to transforming the global food system) concluded that \u201cunhealthy diets are the largest global burden of disease\u201d, and that meat-heavy food production is \u201cthe largest source of environmental degradation\u201d. A major study led by a team from Oxford University, published in the journal Nature in October 2018, showed that huge reductions in meat-eating are essential to slow the rate of climate change. Livestock production has been shown to lead to dangerous levels of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. Factor in pop-science phenomena like the documentaries Cowspiracy! and What the Health \u2013 available on Netflix \u2013 and your diet suddenly seemed like a way you could save the world.\n\nBig Meat continues to lobby aggressively in favour of our God-given right to eat animal flesh, resulting in a series of legal prohibitions surrounding what can and cannot be called \u201cmeat\u201d\u2019 or even \u2013 in one US state \u2013 a \u201cveggie burger\u201d. But veganism\u2019s virality has proved irresistible. From about 2015, vegan and plant-based cookery manuals started to proliferate at a dazzling rate, with the BOSH! boys selling upward of 80,000 copies and spending four weeks on the Sunday Times bestseller list (today, Amazon lists more than 20,000 results for the search term \u201cvegan cookbook\u201d). Sales of plant milks skyrocketed; financial results at the manufacturer of plant-based protein Quorn soared as what one analyst referred to as the \u201cbattle for the centre of the plate\u201d began to draw (fake) blood. By 2018, Byron, M&S and Pret had invested heavily in vegan ranges. It was, this paper proclaimed, \u201cthe year that veganism moved out of the realms of counter-culture and into the mainstream\u201d. In 2014, Veganuary\u2019s inaugural campaign had attracted just 3,300 participants; by 2019 the number was greater than 250,000, with 53% of them under the age of 35.\n\nBut veganism\u2019s explosive growth alone does not explain why it attracted such controversy. There is something inherent to veganism and vegans that arouses deeper feelings. What is it about the vegan lifestyle that stirs such strong emotion in those who don\u2019t happen to share it? Why do people hate vegans so much?\n\nEarly attempts to establish a vegan utopia did not go well. In the 1840s, the transcendentalist philosopher Amos Bronson Alcott (father of the author of Little Women, Louisa May) founded Fruitlands in Harvard, Massachusetts \u2013 a vegan community intended to be nothing less than a second Eden. But Alcott\u2019s insistence that crops had to be planted and fields tilled by hand meant that not enough food could be grown for all of the members (even though the population peaked at just 13); a diet of fruit and grains, typically consumed raw, left participants severely malnourished. Just seven months after opening, Fruitlands closed \u2013 derided, in the words of one biographer, as \u201cone of history\u2019s most unsuccessful utopias\u201d.\n\nThe timing was unfortunate for American vegetarians, who were already engaged in a pitched battle with public opinion. Vegetarians and vegans in the 19th century \u2013 known as Grahamites after the Presbyterian minister and diet reformer Sylvester Graham, who campaigned against meat-eating on the grounds that it was both unhealthy and morally repugnant \u2013 were the subject of frequent vitriolic editorials in the popular and medical press of the day, which described them as \u201ccadaverous\u201d, \u201cfeeble\u201d, \u201chalf-crazed\u201d, \u201csour-visaged\u201d and \u201cfood cranks\u201d.\n\nIn the 21st century the terminology may have changed but the sentiment remains much the same. The 2015 study conducted by MacInnis and Hodson found that only drug addicts were viewed more negatively among respondents. It concluded: \u201cUnlike other forms of bias (eg, racism, sexism), negativity toward vegetarians and vegans is not widely considered a societal problem; rather, [it] is commonplace and largely accepted.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, sociologists Matthew Cole and Karen Morgan observed a phenomenon they called \u201cvegaphobia\u201d, demonstrating that the British media consistently portrayed vegans in a negative light. In the days after her story broke, Selene Nelson, the freelancer at the centre of the Waitrose magazine row, was called \u201chumourless\u201d, \u201ccombative\u201d and \u201cmilitant\u201d. In 2017, residents of the Swiss town of Aargau reportedly called for a vegan foreign resident to be denied citizenship because she was \u201cannoying\u201d, and the glee with which the global media retold the story revealed a widespread and casual prejudice.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Beyond Meat\u2019s Beyond Spring burger.\n\nVeganism\u2019s opponents outline a host of objections to the lifestyle to justify their hostility. Per a now-familiar joke (Q: How do you know if someone\u2019s vegan? A: Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll tell you), vegans are portrayed as preachy and sanctimonious, a characteristic that rankled among MacInnis and Hodson\u2019s respondents in particular, who viewed \u201cvegetarians/vegans more negatively when their motivations concern social justice rather than personal health\u201d.\n\nThere are rational motives to oppose vegan diets on health grounds. They can be deficient in crucial nutrients such as vitamin B-12. This is especially notable in the case of extreme diets (such as fruitarianism) advocated by some vegan bloggers or Instagram influencers with unorthodox approaches to nutritional science. Various supermarket chains have also attempted to meet the burgeoning demand for vegan products with highly processed vegan ready meals \u2013 from the Impossible Burger to plant-based meatballs, goujons and hot dogs. As Bee Wilson argued in these pages, the high proportion of processed ingredients in these products means the so-called health halo they enjoy may well be illusory.\n\nPerhaps all we are doing, as veganism truly goes mainstream and companies such as Beyond Meat reap windfalls, is replacing one kind of industrialised system with another. Evidence suggests that intensive livestock farming is a poor solution to world hunger, given its impact on personal health and the environment, but intensive industrialised farming of soya, maize and grains comes at a significant carbon cost, too \u2013 as does flying in the ingredients to keep berries and nut butters on acai bowls or avocado on toast.\n\nVeganism, of course, is rooted in social justice \u2013 a detail that has faded from view as it has gone mainstream. But even in its dilute 21st-century form, veganism remains confrontational: it casts people\u2019s dietary choices in harsh relief, and people are by nature defensive. In countries where meat is prohibitively expensive for many, people are sometimes vegetarian or vegan by necessity; in the affluent west, not eating meat is an active choice. This makes it a rejection of a lifestyle and a rebuke to the majority\u2019s values \u2013 especially in a country (such as the UK) still struggling to escape the long shadow of rationing. We are conditioned to like animals and decry animal cruelty, and yet we are also brought up in a culture that revels in the bacon sandwich, the Sunday roast, fish and chips. One simple explanation for why people don\u2019t like vegans is because they show how confused humankind is about food choices and how illogical its decision-making can be.\n\nAnd yet none of this really gets to the heart of what it is about vegans that makes people so upset. Calling them humourless or militant, sanctimonious or annoying or hypocrites \u2013 all of these terms are just smokescreens for what it is that people really feel, which is fear. Vegans are unsettling and uncanny: they live among us, speak like us, behave like us \u2013 but for one significant exception. Meat may be murder, but to some people, the prospect of life without it is even worse.\n\nThere is no justification for the amount of meat we eat in western society. The resources that go into humanely rearing and butchering an animal should make its flesh a borderline-unattainable luxury \u2013 and, indeed, in the past, it was. Meat always used to be the preserve of the wealthy, a symbol of prosperity: \u201cA chicken in every pot\u201d remained an aspirational but impractical promise across the best part of a millennium, from the days of Henry IV of France (when the term was invented) all the way through to Herbert Hoover\u2019s 1928 presidential campaign.\n\nIt was only through the technological advances of modern agriculture that meat became attainable and available at supermarket prices. From the mid-1800s onwards, farmers could raise animals bigger, better and faster than in the past; kill them quicker; treat their flesh to prevent it from spoiling; transport it further and store it longer. A commonly cited psychological turning point was the second world war, which engendered what Russell Baker, writing in the New York Times, later described as a kind of \u201cbeef madness\u201d. GIs were sent to the front with rations of tinned meat; once peace had been declared, there was no better symbol of the brave new world than a sizzling celebratory steak. In the course of just over a century, meat went from unattainable luxury to dietary cornerstone; these days, we feel entitled to eat meat every day.\n\nIn March this year, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was discussing the Green New Deal on Showtime\u2019s Desus & Mero US TV talk show when she observed: \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Like, let\u2019s keep it real.\u201d An apparently innocuous comment, rooted in the same common-sense good science that informed the Lancet report on meat and environmental degradation published around the same time? Not if you asked the Republicans, it wasn\u2019t.\n\nRepresentative Rob Bishop of Utah seized on Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comment, claiming that under the Green New Deal the eating of burgers would be \u201coutlawed\u201d. Former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka went one better, using a speech at the Conservative Political Action conference to proclaim: \u201cThey want to take away your hamburgers! This is what Stalin dreamed about but never achieved!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez announcing the Green New Deal, part of which would aim to reduce meat consumption. Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty\n\nStalin was, in fact, full of admiration for the American burger, going so far as to send his minister of foreign trade to the US on a fact-finding mission (the result, the so-called Mikoyan cutlet, would remain an affordable Soviet staple for decades). But \u201cthey\u2019re taking our meat\u201d is as evocative a rallying cry as \u201cthey\u2019re taking our jobs\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re taking our guns\u201d \u2013 it conveys the same sense of individual freedoms being menaced by external forces, a birthright under attack. Ted Cruz (wrongly) alleged that his Democrat rival Beto O\u2019Rourke planned to ban Texas barbecue if elected senator in his place: like the personal firearm, animal flesh has become an emblem of resistance against the encroachments of progressivism, something to be prised from your cold, dead hand. Men\u2019s rights advocate Jordan Peterson is famed for following a beef and salt diet; Donald Trump is renowned for his love of fast food and well-done steak with ketchup; there is even a subset of libertarian cryptocurrency enthusiasts who call themselves Bitcoin carnivores.\n\nIn the internet age, the consumption of meat is visibly aligned with a certain kind of conservative alpha-masculinity. Before he found infamy eating raw flesh, Gatis Lagzdins was best known for hosting a YouTube channel peddling racist ideology and rightwing conspiracies about the Illuminati. Among the alt-right and affiliated circles online, the derogatory term \u201csoy boy\u201d has been adopted along with other terms such as \u201ccuck\u201d and \u201cbeta\u201d as a way of mocking so-called social justice warriors for their perceived lack of vigour. This echoes a finding in the MacInnis/Hodson study, in which respondents from a rightwing background, who seek to uphold traditional gender values, see something alarmingly subversive and worthy of derision in any man who prefers tofu to turkey.\n\nThis loaded use of food-derived epithets cuts both ways. In the UK, the term \u201cgammon\u201d gained currency in the early 2010s as a pejorative apparently inspired by the puce skin tone of enraged, middle-aged middle Englanders. Food has always been bound up in personal identity, and thus inextricable from politics. In their etymology, common terms such as \u201cdiet\u201d (Greek for way of life) and \u201cregime\u201d (Latin: rule) are metaphors for a struggle over what it means to lead one\u2019s life correctly. The very concept of orthorexia (whose sufferers obsessively exclude foods from their diet that they consider harmful) has at its root a corrupted idea of \u201ccorrect\u201d eating. It is impossible to talk about diets without also talking about the implied inadequacies of those who do not follow them; to paraphrase Brillat-Savarin, tell someone what to eat and you tell them who to be.\n\nThe vegan conversation, then, is a stand-in for much bigger things. When we talk about veganism we are talking about environmental and social change; we are also contemplating the erasure of tradition (Texas barbecue! The Sunday roast! The sausage roll!). We are also tabling a long-overdue referendum on how our food choices affect us and the world around us. And as much as its popularity has been pumped up by concepts like flexitarianism, ultimately veganism\u2019s goal is a world in which the annual per-capita consumption of animal products is precisely zero. No wonder things have got so heated.\n\nFood can be a powerful conduit for our anxieties, too. Half a century ago, a letter published in The New England Journal of Medicine described a terrifying new condition whose symptoms \u2013 headache, sweating, heart palpitations \u2013 were associated with a common ingredient of dishes served in Chinese restaurants: monosodium glutamate, or MSG. The flavour-enhancing additive was so demonised that it was banned in some US cities. Despite multiple studies conclusively proving otherwise, the belief in so-called \u201cChinese restaurant syndrome\u201d remains widespread today: Asian-American chefs still find themselves having to justify the use of MSG despite its widespread use in non-Asian foods too. It is a neat example of the persistence of food-related urban legends. There was no doubt a racist element to the way the MSG myth spread; those involved in its dissemination were also motivated by a gnawing fear of obsolescence as a new threat to their existence began to gain popularity.\n\nThose opposing meat-eating have a struggle ahead of them. It is clear that what is at stake here is not steak, but identity. A movement that preaches such wholesale change is bound to stir up anxieties, chief among them the sense that vegan dishes such as the Greggs Quorn sausage roll are being positioned not as alternatives but as replacements.\n\nWith a few notable exceptions \u2013 most of them religious \u2013 meat has retained its primacy in cultures across the world. It originally became a status symbol because it was harder to obtain than plant matter \u2013 even a small animal could run away, and if caught, was capable of inflicting wounds that could prove fatal in a world before antibiotics. As society became hierarchical, there was no greater token of status than the ability to eat meat on a whim. In her 2016 book Meathooked, Marta Zaraska records the discovery of Egyptian tombs in which the pharaohs had been buried alongside \u201cmeat mummies\u201d, baskets of beef and poultry that had been embalmed in preparation for the afterlife. Our fetishisation of meat has not lessened \u2013 on the contrary, forecasters predict rapid increase in meat consumption in developing countries over the next decade. As a ready source of protein, meat remains the great aspiration, the surest proof of prosperity.\n\nAs Carol J Adams wrote, the words we use shield us from the moral consequences of carnivory: we eat beef, not cows, pork, not pigs, while a cabbage remains just a cabbage wherever it is in its life cycle. Our language ennobles meat at the expense of veg: strong, muscular types are \u201cbeefy\u201d, lazy people are \u201ccouch potatoes\u201d, unresponsive ones \u201cvegetables\u201d. Turning our back on meat-eating is not as simple as changing from pork to Quorn: it requires us to reject some entrenched values.\n\nAlready, there are signs that a great migration is underway. The UK university caterer Tuco recently reported that record numbers of canteens are going meat-free, describing the adoption of vegan or vegetarian diets among students and staff as a \u201cmega-trend\u201d. On the high street, too, there is a growing recognition that vegan ranges are not just opportunistic cash-grabs but potential best-sellers. After the success of Greggs\u2019 vegan sausage roll, Tesco announced it would be increasing its range of dedicated plant-based products by nearly 50% to keep pace with demand.\n\nSales may be growing fast, but they are barely making a dent in the $1.7tr global market for animal-derived protein. Certainly, a change of culture will not happen without the involvement of government, industry and science; as the past few years have shown, widespread change is also unlikely to happen without a fight. This makes the current field of conflict an unfortunate one \u2013 in the real world, we can practise moderation, emotional flexitarianism. Online \u2013 where many of the vegan wars\u2019 most intense skirmishes are currently being fought \u2013 we do not find compromise or even look for it. The internet has made communication highly charged and polarised; the only way to be heard in such a screaming vortex is to shout louder.\n\nBut the body of evidence suggesting that we eat too much meat is approaching the point where it becomes undeniable. This summer, a UN report identified destruction of forests and emissions from cattle and other intensive farming practices as major factors driving the climate crisis towards a point of no return.\n\nWhite gold: the unstoppable rise of alternative milks Read more\n\nSome are proposing urgent action, such as the QC Michael Mansfield, who recently suggested (in a speech given at the launch of the Vegan Now campaign) that meat-eating could become illegal. He drew a parallel with the smoking ban, and it is indeed eminently possible that in time meat (especially red meat) becomes the new tobacco \u2013 a vice enjoyed by a small number of people in full awareness of its negative health consequences.\n\nBut in coining the term \u201cecocide\u201d \u2013 and classing it as a crime against humanity \u2013 Mansfield framed the debate in different terms. We might portray the current moment as a precipice, and the growing interest in plant-based diets as the surest way back to safety. In this interpretation, the war on vegans is the act of a doomed majority fighting to defend its harmful way of life. Vegans might well be vociferous and annoying, holier-than-thou, self-satisfied and evangelical. But as their numbers grow beyond the margins, perhaps the worst thing they could be is right.\n\n\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here", "description": "The long read: It has left the beige-tinted margins and become social media\u2019s most glamorous look.
