The skipper was booed and sarcastically applauded by his own fans.\n\nIt is claimed Xhaka has been particularly fragile since the 3-2 win over Aston Villa on September 22, where he was also booed by Arsenal fans as he was substituted.\n\nThe former Borussia Monchengladbach star has been targeted by Gunners fans on social media, something which is understood to have deeply upset Xhaka.\n\nIt is understood Xhaka even disabled the comments function on his Instagram page earlier this month to avoid seeing the abuse levelled at him.\n\nIntriguingly, Xhaka replaced his profile photograph on Instagram from a snap of playing for Arsenal to one of him playing for Switzerland on Tuesday.\n\nXhaka's team-mates have rallied round him since Sunday - and are privately backing their beleaguered colleague to remain as captain despite calls from supporters for him to be stripped of the armband.\n\nXhaka took off his shirt before heading down the tunnel and told fans to 'f*** off'\n\nXhaka was appointed captain after a vote which included playing staff - a clear indication of his popularity.\n\nBut Emery was refusing to be drawn on whether Xhaka would remain as club captain on Tuesday; though the lack of conviction in making a final decision suggests a reluctance to demote his midfield anchorman.\n\nEmery has, however, revealed that Xhaka has so far ignored pleas from inside the club to apologise to fans.\n\nThe Gunners boss said: 'Yes [he should apologise]. We make mistakes, we need to apologise and we suggested for him to do that.\n\n'Really, he knows he was wrong and he feels inside very deep. He is now devastated and sad.\n\n'Now, he is down. He is down and the most important thing now is that we look after him to recover our best Granit Xhaka.'\n\nMeanwhile, Mesut Ozil will return to the Arsenal squad for Wednesday night's game at Anfield following heart-to-heart talks with Emery.\n\nMesut Ozil has fallen out of favour and Emery has had a heart-to-heart with him\n\nThe German has controversially been axed from the previous six match-day squads, casting huge doubt over his future at the club.\n\nBut Ozil - who could even captain the team in Xhaka's absence - is set to play against Liverpool following showdown talks with Emery at the training ground on Tuesday.\n\n'We have had a very good conversation, Mesut and Me, and I said to him I haven't changed my idea about him,' added Emery.\n\n'He knows what I want from him because it's the same as last season in the first day of pre-season training when we had a conversation. Our conversation on Tuesday morning was because I wanted to listen to him about how he's thinking now to help us and be with us tomorrow. It was a very good conversation and tomorrow he's in the group.'", "description": "Granit Xhaka will be offered counselling by Arsenal amid growing concerns about the midfielder's mental well-being following ordeal that leaves him at risk of losing the captaincy.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20345718-0-image-a-65_1572382486691.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
