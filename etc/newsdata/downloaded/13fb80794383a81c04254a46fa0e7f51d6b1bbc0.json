A president should never be able to use the office for personal gain,\" the former vice president said.\n\nCritics, including ethic campaigners, said holding the event at Doral would violate both the foreign and domestic emoluments clauses that are designed to shield a US leader from outside influence.\n\n\"He is exploiting his office and making official US government decisions for his personal financial gain,\" Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement following the Thursday announcement.\n\n191017174401257\n\nOn Thursday, Mulvaney had discounted Camp David, the government-owned presidential retreat, as the site for the summit, saying: \"I understand the folks who participated in it hated it and thought it was a miserable place to have the G-7.\" He added that it was too small and remote for the international summit.", "description": "Trump faced accusations he was using presidency to enrich himself by hosting summit at his private resort.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/20/e3c3580f71964055b77482962f349e28_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
