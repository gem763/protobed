Yes, I am dumb enough to believe it, given that the president has previously handed over highly classified intelligence to Russia; sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin against U.S. intelligence; devised military strategy in public at Mar-a-Lago; insulted leaders of Britain, Germany and France; shoved the prime minister of Montenegro; fallen \u201cin love\u201d with North Korea\u2019s dictator; invited the Taliban to Camp David; asked if he could nuke hurricanes; taken children from their parents and put them in warehouses; altered a weather forecast with a Sharpie; said windmills cause cancer; and hired Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe last may be most worrisome, for when the former New York mayor and current raving madman went on CNN on Thursday night to explain the president\u2019s promise, his primary defense was to shout out Joe Biden\u2019s name \u2014 24 times (with cameos for George Soros and Whitey Bulger\u2019s nephew). Giuliani said he had proof that Biden bribed the Ukrainian government to protect his son, but \u201cI don\u2019t have to give you the proof\u201d \u2014 and, alas, available evidence doesn\u2019t support Giuliani\u2019s claim.\n\nIn the process, Giuliani managed to contradict himself within seconds, first saying he didn\u2019t ask Ukraine to investigate Biden, then saying, \u201cOf course I did.\u201d He completed his defense of the president with a series of random interjections shouted at host Chris Cuomo: \u201cYou are a sellout. . . . Come after me! . . . Go somewhere on an island. . . . Do you think I\u2019m a fool? . . . I\u2019m institutionally insulting you. . . . Holy God! . . . You don\u2019t think there\u2019s a Deep State? . . . Wait, wait, damn it, let me finish! . . . Of course I\u2019m making sense! . . . You shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed for me. . . . Of course I\u2019m aware of what I\u2019m saying! . . . You shouldn\u2019t have a good night!\u201d\n\nClearly, Trump and his wild-eyed lawyer can do better. I am here for them.\n\nWhen The Post reported Wednesday night that the administration was blocking Congress from learning about an \u201curgent\u201d intelligence-agency whistleblower complaint involving Trump\u2019s promise to a foreign leader, it listed possible countries as Russia, North Korea, Qatar, Pakistan and the Netherlands. This left open the hopeful possibility that Trump, having failed to buy Greenland from Denmark, had entered into a promise to buy Aruba from the Dutch. This would likely be a friendly transaction, because the people of Aruba\u2019s capital, Oranjestad, would welcome an orange president.\n\nEven if the mystery leader turned out to be Putin, all was not lost. Trump needn\u2019t have promised Putin Ukraine. Maybe he promised him something innocuous, such as a Mar-a-Lago membership, a Presidential Medal of Freedom or Alaska. Maybe it was as simple as promising Putin a new steed for his next horseback photo shoot.\n\nThe defense became trickier Thursday night, however, when The Post reported that Trump\u2019s \u201cpromise\u201d did indeed involve Ukraine, and Friday, with reports that he asked Ukraine to investigate Biden\u2019s son. This raised the ominous possibility that Trump might have offered to give Ukraine a promised $250 million in military aid against Russia-backed separatists only if Ukraine provided dirt on Biden (or information helpful to imprisoned former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort).\n\nStill, there are plenty of totally benign explanations for why Trump withheld the $250 million:\n\n1. Trump was just joking, like when he asked Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. (The new Ukrainian president was a comedian!)\n\n2. Mexico was supposed to pay for it.\n\n3. Biden took the $250 million!\n\n4. Trump had the $250 million in cash, but it fell out of his pocket while he was boarding Air Force One.\n\n5. Trump needed the $250 million because Saudi emoluments were in arrears at the Trump International Hotel in Washington.\n\n6. Biden took it!\n\n7. Trump needed the money because the Air Force stopped booking personnel at Trump\u2019s resort in Scotland.\n\n8. The Pentagon repurposed the $250 million to build the wall.\n\n9. Biden took it!\n\n10. Trump needed the funds for hush money.\n\n11. The funds were needed to keep Giuliani under 24-hour supervision in a tranquil setting.\n\n12. Also, Joe Biden!\n\nIn the unlikely event all these explanations fail, Trump could finally fall back on this one, which has the virtue of being true: His \u201cpromise\u201d wasn\u2019t necessary. Russia is already interfering in the 2020 election cycle, undoubtedly to help Trump as it did last time. Trump has also befriended many of the world\u2019s most brutal autocrats and strongmen, in North Korea, the Philippines, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Hungary and Brazil \u2014 and some of them are sure to give Trump an assist in the election as well.\n\nIs Trump \u201cdumb enough\u201d to believe he has to ask?\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "The whistleblower had no reason to be concerned!", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "September At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
