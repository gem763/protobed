For some, the price becomes cost-prohibitive if they wait too long to make a purchase. For instance, according to the industry group American Association of Long-Term Care Insurance, a 65-year-old couple can purchase a policy for $4,800 per year that will give them base benefits of $180,000 plus 3% inflation growth. The price for that same plan more than doubles to $8,700 per year if the couple waits until age 75 to buy. And others may have health conditions that make them ineligible for coverage at any price.\n\nFactors Pushing Insurance Rates Higher\n\nSome policyholders have run into trouble in recent years as premiums spiked on plans sold in the 1990s and early 2000s. Long-term care insurance experts say the rate hikes seen on older policies were the result of faulty assumptions about the number of claims that would be made and how many policies would lapse. What's more, some insurers did little to no underwriting in the early years, making it possible for virtually anyone to buy coverage regardless of the probability of them filing expensive claims in the future.\n\nIt's a different story for policies sold today. Long-term care insurers have made significant changes in how they issue and price their plans. \"They've fixed their pricing. They've fixed their underwriting,\" says Noel Evans, a long-term care insurance specialist in the District of Columbia. Now that companies have decades of claims data to base their underwriting, premiums should become less volatile in the future.\n\nStill, if you find yourself priced out of the market or ineligible for health reasons, there are other options to pay for long-term care, ranging from reverse mortgages to Medicaid.\n\n[Read: Alternatives to Long-Term Care Insurance]\n\n10 Alternate Ways to Pay for Long-Term Care\n\nDon't count on Medicare to pay for nursing home, assisted living or ongoing home health care. Medicare benefits for that type of care are typically only available after a hospitalization or injury and for a limited duration. While Medicare isn't an option, here are 10 alternatives that are:\n\n-- Group Long-Term Care Insurance\n\n-- Short-Term Care Insurance\n\n-- Life/Long-Term Care Insurance\n\n-- Health Savings Accounts\n\n-- Long-Term Care Annuities\n\n-- Life Plan Communities\n\n-- Veterans Benefits\n\n-- Home Equity\n\n-- Pensions or Social Security\n\n-- Medicaid\n\nGroup Long-Term Care Insurance\n\nIf you're not eligible for an individual long-term care insurance policy, you may be able to get group coverage as a voluntary benefit at work. \"These policies are very affordable to employees,\" Evans says. Plus, some employers may help cover the cost of premiums.\n\nGroup policies also may operate under a simplified underwriting process, making them more accessible. Group long-term care insurance benefits aren't widespread yet, so employees may have to inquire with their human resources office about the possibility of adding this benefit.\n\nShort-Term Care Insurance\n\nAlso known as recovery care, these plans are similar to long-term care insurance policies, but benefits are typically capped at one year. Not only are they less expensive, but they may also be available to older seniors or those who aren't otherwise eligible for long-term coverage.\n\nLife/Long-Term Care Insurance\n\nLife insurance policies that include long-term care riders are exploding in popularity right now, says Michael Gerstman, CEO of the Dallas-headquartered retirement planning firm Gerstman Financial Group, LLC. These riders often let people dip into up to half of their death benefit early in order to pay long-term care expenses. Some companies may charge for a rider within a plan's premium while others take a fee from the death benefit should the rider be utilized.\n\nVantis Life uses the latter option, company CEO Ray Caucci says. Policyholders with a chronic illness accelerated benefit rider don't have to pay upfront, but their beneficiaries will receive a reduced death benefit that reflects both the accelerated benefits as well as a fee for the rider. \"It's a trade-off,\" Caucci acknowledges. However, it's one people may be willing to make since it gives them money for long-term care without locking them into a dedicated long-term care policy they may never use.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Long-term care insurance is coverage that will pay for assisted living, nursing home care or home health care in the event you are unable to care for yourself because of a chronic condition or disability.
