KIDDING.\n\nOf course he didn\u2019t do that because you know, Kavanaugh was nominated by \u2018orange man bad\u2019 so it was AOK for a bunch of soulless, lying, manipulative, power-hungry, self-important Democrats to try and destroy him.\n\nBut it\u2019s not ok for Katie Hill to be held accountable for her actions, even if the evidence against her is actually real.\n\nLook at this BS.\n\n.@chrislhayes on the implications of Rep. Katie Hill's resignation: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a generation of politicians where there are thousands of images around. We\u2019re going to have to decide as a society if we\u2019re going to let that be a permanent source of blackmail\u2026\u201d pic.twitter.com/5D9jt0Bbiz \u2014 All In with Chris Hayes (@allinwithchris) October 29, 2019\n\nFFS.\n\nMedia- photographs shouldn\u2019t be used against Democrats.\n\nAlso Media- KAVANAUGH\u2019S YEARBOOK FROM ALMOST 4 DECADES AGO!!!!!!!! LOOK WHAT\u2019S IN THE YEARBOOK!!!!!https://t.co/jc8wIY2nde \u2014 Mr T 2 (@GovtsTheProblem) October 29, 2019\n\nThey really are just a joke.\n\nChris Hayes already made the decision for society apparently. https://t.co/tbyDUtxLAc \u2014 Mr T 2 (@GovtsTheProblem) October 29, 2019\n\nOr perhaps we ask ourselves: Why are so many young people allowing others to take compromising photos of them? Why are we just accepting this as the norm? Is this \"progress\" and moving us in the right direction as a society? \u2014 Move Over (@conartist71) October 29, 2019\n\nOr even better, elected officials behave in a manner where they know they could be seen or photographed at any moment. Crazy talk, right?\n\nIt\u2019s still unethical behavior and abuse of power. We can address the consequences against those who try to blackmail, but we should never make excuse the politician\u2019s behavior. \u2014 Nobody (@Truth_Seeker_5) October 29, 2019\n\nBut it\u2019s ok when a Democrat does it, duh.\n\nI dunno. I think the key is to never send nudes. \u2014 Leans to the Left (@CodeNameD57) October 29, 2019\n\nDING DING DING.\n\nRule number one, don\u2019t sleep with the help. \u2014 Tom (@NCSU_Tom) October 29, 2019\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t they be held to the highest standard? Hard working tax payers pay for their salaries. Elected officials should be scrutinized the most. They don\u2019t always earn job based on total qualifications of the norm, it\u2019s mostly popularity earned. \u2014 Sean D (@Settler55) October 29, 2019\n\nOr! Just don\u2019t bang staffers! \u2014 Spider-Ken (@SpiderKenX) October 29, 2019\n\nThe media are working overtime to make an abuser like Katie Hill the victim, just because she has a D by her name.
