It is the second largest Ebola outbreak in history, after a 2013-16 epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,300.\n\nThe Merck vaccine, which the company has now brand-named Ervebo, is likely to get a full marketing licence from the European Commission within a few weeks.\n\nMerck said in a statement its priority now was to get regulatory approval of its Ervebo manufacturing site in Germany so that licensed supply of the vaccine \u201ccan be used to support global public health preparedness.\u201d\n\nHealth authorities in Kinshasa said last week they planned to introduce an experimental second Ebola vaccine, developed by drugmaker Johnson & Johnson, in November in the country\u2019s eastern provinces.\n\nEbola virus causes haemorrhagic fever and spreads from person to person through direct contact with body fluids. It kills around half of those it infects.\n\nThere are currently no licensed treatments for the deadly infection, but scientists said in August they were a step closer to being able to cure it after two experimental drugs showed survival rates of as much as 90% in a clinical trial in Congo.", "description": "The world's first Ebola vaccine was approved by European drugs regulators on Friday in a move hailed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a \"triumph for public health\" that would save many lives.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442301383&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1C0-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
