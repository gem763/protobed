While RealClearPolitics has taken \u201cmajor pains to be seen as nonpartisan and non-ideological in its reporting,\u201d the Daily Beast wrote, the \u201cConservative Country\u201d page has around 796,000 followers and pushes the kind of right-wing meat slurry Americans would usually find dished out at Infowars or Breitbart. Nowhere on the page is it disclosed that the page is run by RealClear Media. The page\u2019s also another reminder of how easy it is for pretty much anyone to reach mass audiences with sloppy propaganda on Facebook while simultaneously hiding both their motives and who\u2019s behind it.\n\nRecent hits include an image of guns aimed at a door captioned \u201cjust sitting here waiting on Beto [O\u2019Rourke],\u201d numerous \u201cMexican word of the day\u201d posts with various Democratic politicians photoshopped wearing a sombrero, and a cartoon of a Muslim at prayer captioned, \u201cHere\u2019s my new invention I call it the Muhammed-3000 a landmine that looks like [sic] a prayer mat. Prophets are going through the roof.\u201d Others portray Muslim members of U.S. Congress as terrorists, contain misogynist jokes, and spread conspiracy theories.\n\nThe Conservative Country page uses the same logo and name as a website that went defunct in October 2017 after Facebook nuked various methods digital publishers used to rack up traffic.\n\nEchoing a familiar technobabble defence that some offensive misdeed is a social experiment or whatever, RealClear CTO Anand Ramanujan told the Daily Beast that the Conservative Country website was \u201cpart of an effort to understand the flow of traffic from social media \u2014 particularly Facebook \u2014 to political websites.\u201d Ramanujan didn\u2019t answer questions about the Facebook page, the Daily Beast wrote, but a former writer for the page characterised it as a pay-to-play operation selling reach to third parties (incidentally, it frequently linked to foreign political hoaxers):\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign season, the page drove traffic to Macedonian sites known for publishing outrageously false stories to reap ad profits. It\u2019s unclear whether those links appeared by negligence or design. According to a former writer for Conservative Country, RealClear monetises the Facebook page with a pay-for-play model: Third-party publishers can put up cash to get a post featured on the highly trafficked page. \u201cThere were companies paying RealClear for traffic, and Conservative Country was another RealClear page that companies could promote on,\u201d the writer said. \u201cThe whole thing was money based, not activist based or anything like that.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast also found that the main purpose of the page appears to be driving traffic back to its owner\u2019s properties: \u201c240 of the 1,070 external links posted on the page since January 2017 are to RealClear Media\u2019s flagship title, RealClearPolitics.\u201d\n\nRealClear Media has tried hard to portray its properties as level-headed arbiters of the American political landscape. At the same time, its principals are players in the conservative media (RealClearPolitics co-founder John McIntyre was listed in 2017 as a director of far-right rag the Federalist) and it regularly features links to sites like Breitbart. As the Daily Beast noted, three of its seven featured opinion writers are Donald Trump supporters.\n\nThis is, of course, par for the course with Facebook, a headache-inducing mess of a platform that has essentially become synonymous with fuelling online disinformation, political manipulation, lack of transparency and generally toxic behaviour.\n\nIt\u2019s also been closely associated with the rise of far-right propaganda in America (networked in ways never before possible) and conspiracy rabbit holes. To put it another way, Conservative Country is just another piece of smouldering trash in Facebook\u2019s never-ending garbage fire. Feel free to ignore the \u201cNo Dumping\u201d sign.\n\n[The Daily Beast]", "description": "Prominent American political website RealClearPolitics\u2019 parent company has secretly been running a far-right Facebook page trafficking in memes about assassinating Muslims at prayer, racial stereotypes and conspiracy theories, according to the Daily Beast....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Alex Cranz"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/vwpbxwju0lebbz8mpjsb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
