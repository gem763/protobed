Boothroyd hopes the setback will sharpen minds ahead of Tuesday's European Championship qualifier against Austria in Milton Keynes.\n\n'The manager mentioned the feeling of the (summer) Euros and we've had a taste of disappointment now,' defender Max Aarons said. 'He's said to use that going forward as a feeling that we don't want to have. It can definitely be a good thing.\n\nAidy Boothroyd told his England Under-21 team to learn from their recent capitulation\n\n'If we just went through the qualification process beating teams and it being really easy then we wouldn't learn anything. To have a bit of that, we'll know never to switch off. You can't at international level, regardless who you're playing. Whether it's Spain or Slovenia, you have to be switched on.'\n\nMidfielder Phil Foden believes the draw in Slovenia indicated this is a work in progress for a new set of players and it will soon click.\n\n'It's a young team and some of the lads are only just breaking into the side,' Foden said. 'They need to get that side of how to see games out at the end. I think they're going to learn that when they play more games.\n\n'You can't just expect to get results straight away with a new team. Obviously we'd like to but the manager knows that he needs to look at a few players. He still probably doesn't know his best team. Slovenia was about figuring things out.'", "description": "Defensive mistakes saw the Young Lions surrender a two-goal lead in the final 10 minutes of a friendly they dominated.
