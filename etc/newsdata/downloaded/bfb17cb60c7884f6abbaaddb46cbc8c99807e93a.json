The U.S. Energy Department said on Saturday it is ready to release oil from its strategic reserve if needed.\n\n\"Oil prices will jump on this attack, and if the disruption to Saudi production is prolonged, an SPR release ... seems likely and sensible,\" said Jason Bordoff, founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York.\n\nIt is too early to know the extent of the damage to the processing plants and the Saudi supply chain that brings crude from oil fields to export facilities. The chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, said in a statement that the company will have more information within 48 hours, as it works to bring back the lost output.\n\nAramco exported more than 7 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude last year, with almost three-quarters of its crude exports delivered to customers in Asia last year. The country has about 188 million barrels in reserve, or roughly 37 days of Abqaiq's processing capacity, according to a Saturday note from Rapidan Energy Group.\n\nThe spare capacity held by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries https://tmsnrt.rs/2kxzPFn (OPEC) to supply consumers in the event of a significant production shortfall has been declining for decades as aging oil fields have lost production capacity.\n\nSaudi Arabia's 2.3 million bpd of effective spare capacity in August accounted for more than two-thirds of OPEC's on-hand supply of 3.2 million bpd, according to the International Energy Agency, with most of the rest from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nRussia may have spare capacity following the international pact between OPEC and its allies to curb production in support of crude prices, analysts said.\n\nThe U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve currently holds about 644 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Department, roughly equal to 52 days of U.S. production.\n\nA prolonged outage could spur higher production and exports from the United States, but it takes months for U.S. companies to respond to price signals because of logistical limitations, analysts and traders said.\n\nThe United States now produces more than 12 million bpd and exports more than 3 million bpd, but it is unclear if U.S. export facilities can handle additional shipments.\n\n\"Every day the facility is shut down, the world loses another 5 million barrels of oil production,\" said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. \"The world's spare capacity is not 5 million barrels per day.\"", "description": "Attacks on Saudi facilities threaten spare oil capacity, price hikes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8D0SJ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
