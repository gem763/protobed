That combination is taking experiential learning to a whole new level, giving students direct exposure to the simulated world of wonders, monuments and historical sites and, thereby, adding a new kind of interest and excitement to all kinds of different classes.\n\nLearning Chinese made easy thanks to app by Education University of Hong Kong\n\nHowever, to maximise the potential benefits, teachers must have the skills to locate or create suitable content. And they need the right pedagogies to ensure VR is used in a meaningful and educational way.\n\nWith this in mind, Dr Cheung Ting-on, Associate Professor in the Department of Social Sciences at The Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK), is working with his team and other universities to show the way. The aim is to give trainee and current teachers the know-how to deploy VR as an effective aid in the classroom. It is all being done as part of a three-year, HK$3.7-million project funded by the University Grants Committee (UGC)\u2019s Funding Scheme for Teaching and Learning.\n\nTeaching students about repairing old items, with a little help from 3D printers\n\n\u201cWith VR gaining in popularity around the world, the technology can add value in the way education is delivered,\u201d Cheung says. \u201cThe VR teaching kit currently being developed will benefit our pre-service teachers, giving them hands-on experience with 360-degree cameras and drones. It will also provide methods for integrating VR content into what they are teaching.\u201d\n\nIn due course, this kit will be made available for all local UGC-funded universities.\n\nProviding support for asylum seekers and refugees in Hong Kong with volunteer students from EdUHK\n\nTo this end, Cheung\u2019s team has been working on a number of three-dimensional learning modules since 2016. These include simulations of various natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, floods and landslides.\n\nOnce ready, the team will provide training workshops for academics and teachers from other universities on lesson planning and the use of the VR teaching resources.\n\nA preview of what the Forbidden City looks like in VR.

EdUHK students had a first look at these in September when the university opened its first Virtual Reality Laboratory on campus.\n\n\u201cVR teaching resources can be applied to a wide variety of subjects,\u201d Cheung says. \u201cFor example, the modules being developed can be adopted in the geography, liberal studies and general studies curriculum. Ultimately, though, the use of technology in education has only one goal, which is to enrich the learning experience of students.\u201d\n\nEdited by John Cremer", "description": "Sponsored Feature", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/eduhk_vr_1600_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
