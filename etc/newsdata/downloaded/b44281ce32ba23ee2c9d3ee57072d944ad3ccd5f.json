Ron Johnson For Pushing Fox News 'Propaganda'", "language": "en", "text": "NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd interviewed Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) about President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, the center of an impeachment inquiry into the president, and things quickly got heated.\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s episode of \u201cMeet The Press,\u201d Todd asked Johnson why he said he \u201cwinced\u201d when a U.S. ambassador told him that aid to Ukraine was contingent on an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a frontrunner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nBut Johnson, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee, dodged the question and instead pushed a conspiracy theory about the origins of Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cWhat does this have to do with Ukraine?\u201d Todd interrupted. \u201cI have no idea why a Fox News conspiracy propaganda stuff is popping up on here.\u201d\n\nWATCH: @SenRonJohnson is asked why he winced & brings up a \"conspiracy theory.\"@chucktodd: \"I have no idea why we're going here. ... Can we please answer the question I asked you instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you're not criticizing him?\" #MTP pic.twitter.com/41i7WPHQlF \u2014 Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) October 6, 2019\n\nJohnson responded by defending Trump and his supporters for being \u201cupset\u201d with the media.\n\n\u201cThis is not about the media,\u201d Todd cut in, growing visibly frustrated. \u201cSenator Johnson, please. Can we please answer the question that I asked you instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you\u2019re not criticizing him? I\u2019m just trying to ask a simple question.\u201d\n\nJohnson then acknowledged that he was upset to hear military aid was being withheld until Ukraine committed to investigate Biden.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want those connected,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here\u2019s the salient point of why I came forward: When I asked the president about that, he completely denied it. ... He said, \u2018I\u2019d never do that.\u2019 So that is the piece of the puzzle that I am here to report today.\u201d\n\nHe added that he\u2019s not trying to \u201cdefend\u201d or \u201cdenounce\u201d Trump, but that he simply wants the truth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only dealing with the facts that we have, not the facts that you wish them to be,\u201d Todd said. \u201cYou\u2019re making a choice not to believe the investigations that have taken place.\u201d\n\nJohnson was part of the envoy, along with Energy Secretary Rick Perry, that traveled to Ukraine in May for the inauguration of the country\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky. After the visit, Johnson told The Wall Street Journal that he told Trump that he was confident in Zelensky as a leader.\n\nTrump later pressed Zelensky during a July phone call to look into Biden. A U.S. intelligence official filed a whistleblower complaint in August regarding the call and alleging the White House tried to cover it up.\n\nTrump claims Biden, as vice president, demanded the notoriously corrupt prosecutor general in Ukraine be fired for the purpose of impeding an investigation into a Ukrainian gas company where his son, Hunter, served on the board. No evidence has been brought to light to suggest this and Ukrainian authorities have cleared Biden of any wrongdoing.\n\nA 2016 bipartisan letter signed by Johnson and several other Republican senators expressed concern over Ukraine\u2019s \u201centrenched corruption\u201d and echoed Biden\u2019s support for reforming the prosecutor general\u2019s office.\n\nDuring a subsequent interview with Todd on Sunday, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said he\u2019s \u201cdeeply scared\u201d by Republicans\u2019 defense of Trump in the wake of the whistleblower complaint.\n\n\u201cThat interview was just a giant green light to the president of the United States to continue to solicit foreign interference in presidential elections,\u201d Murphy said of Johnson\u2019s exchange with Todd. \u201cThis entire country should be scared that at a moment when we need patriots, what we are getting is blind partisan loyalty.\u201d\n\nLove HuffPost?
