Shaheen Mistri, CEO, Teach for India gets candidDidi, as she is fondly called by her students (her kids, as she prefers), is constantly juggling meetings with classroom sessions, and family with training sessions. And yet, she has time for what she is popular for\u2014imparting love to her children. They come first, and no one at her organisation\u2014Teach For India\u2014is complaining. Shaheen Mistri, founder and CEO, Teach For India (TFI), knows that even 10 years after it all started, the work is tougher, and gets more challenging by the day.The two-year paid fellowship programme by the non-profit, recruits passionate college students and professionals to teach full-time in under-resourced schools in seven cities across the country, with the aim of building equity in education. The idea is to equip school students with the necessary skills, and enhance their existing abilities, trying to combat the omnipresent rote-based and competitive environment. Since its inception close to 11 years ago, the programme has grown, and operates in 340 schools impacting the lives of about 38,000 students, annually. TFI also sees about 500 alumni joining the movement every year. In 2019, TFI welcomed 446 bright, committed fellows.Apart from the many visible achievements of TFI, what tops Mistri\u2019s list of not-so-visible victories, is the fact that it is challenging the very purpose of education as it plays out in the country today. \u201cIf you look at the sytem, it\u2019s like you get to the top of your class, go to an elite college, get rich, and perpetuate the same cycle with the next generation. We\u2019re trying to see if we can go back to where education used to be in our country\u2014holistic with a balance of the head, heart, hand, focusing on skills, values, mindsets, exposure integrated beautifully together,\u201d she says.The selection process of the programme is not competitive, but has a high-set bar. \u201cWe still struggle to attract enough talent to meet the bar. In any year, we have crossed eight per cent of selectivity. It hovers between six and eight per cent,\u201d Mistri informs. Despite such a stringent process, fellows are shell-shocked when they enter the classrooms, even after being immersed in a five-week boot camp residential training. The transition from that to their classroom in the city is rocky.One of the biggest challenges that the fellows are aware of, but not prepared for in terms of the proportion of its occurring, is child safety. \u201cIt\u2019s horrifying to see the way kids are being treated in schools\u2014beaten, humiliated, made fun of, and bullied. It is the single biggest challenge that holds the kids back,\u201d she shares. Unfortunately, the TFI fellows, at an average age of 23 years, are ill-equipped to deal with it, since the schools (mainly government or low-income private schools) where they are placed, are not in TFI\u2019s control. \u201cSince these are government schools, we can take no action against the perpetrating teachers. Which is why the fellows\u2019 anger is also directed towards TFI that at an organisational level we can\u2019t do much to curb this mistreatment.\u201d Another challenge is that there is no one to help students coming from high poverty areas. The social issues that arise and get in the way of learning are massive. Suddenly, a fellow finds no help offered to a student with a mental health issue, or who is dealing with a parent\u2019s unemployment. \u201cBasically, you are hit with all of India\u2019s social issues, and the work is too hard, complex, and nuanced,\u201d Mistri says.With that, even if the first year goes by in a blur for the fellows, their transformation and leadership accelerates, which goes a long way in their career path. In the long-term, they go on to becoming alumni, and support the growing community to advocate for change. They work in diverse sectors, and one of the organisation\u2019s goals is to explore how such people can work together to drive systemic change. TFI is also working on a project named Kids Education Revolution, where they are trying to explore a child\u2019s potential to be an agent of change for driving equity in education for other kids.For that, Mistri feels imparting the right kind of teacher training is imperative. \u201cTeaching is both an art and a science. It\u2019s tedious professional development, and continuous. I don\u2019t think the traditional teacher training model operational in the country works; we need a far more practical model,\u201d Mistri elaborates. Recognising this gap, TFI has initiated an online platform, firki.co, freely available pedagogy material suited to Indian context and classrooms.A question that plagues the mind when one thinks of working with modest-background children is how does one get them to dream when they are struggling with everyday, existential problems? Mistri doesn\u2019t bat an eyelid to answer, \u201cDreams are wired in their DNA. The difficulty lies in giving them the real skills to deliver on those dreams.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly why the recently-launched book on TFI\u2019s 10-year journey, is called Grey Sunshine. \u201cThe ability to live within the grey helps us get through our days. Grey Sunshine signifies the idea that while there is a cloud of grey surrounding our work, we strive for the sunshine of potential and hope,\u201d she signs off.", "description": "Mistri is committed, dynamic, and ever eager to learn from her mistakes, much like the fellows her organisation recruits, and the students they teach", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/sthshaheen1571981670.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
