It takes place every week.\n\nHealthy body for a robust mind\n\nThe workout exercises range from yoga, jogging, and soccer. According to Thebe, the aim of training sessions is to alleviate stress-related illnesses. \"The exercise is to assist councillors manage everyday challenges with fresh minds and fit bodies. The intention is not necessarily for weight loss but for a body that is healthy to tolerate the stress that comes with the job,\" says Thebe.\n\nHe explains the training sessions are also good team-building exercises in an entertaining manner as opposed to the usual tense debates in the office and council chamber. The councillors who take part, he says, get a chance to laugh and relax.\n\nWhat the community faces\n\nMaluti-a-Phofung is experiencing water challenges as QwaQwa residents continue to get brown water from their taps. The exercises were met with harsh criticism from the community. Modise Makhalemele, a resident, says: \"Health awareness starts with clean water from the tap.\"\n\nJoseph Memani asks: \u201cHow can you promote health awareness whilst water is from the taps is brown like coffee?\u201c\n\nMunicipality spokesperson, Kedibone Sentle says the level of water at Fika Patso Dam, which supplies 80% of the municipality with water, is standing at below 15% due to less rain and climate change. The members of the community are receiving brown water because \"water quality from the dam has drastically deteriorated and subsequently the water treatment plant is challenged to effectiveness\".\n\nExpansion of the training\n\nSentle says Thebe recruited all the councillors of the local municipality and \"others from the district municipality have also been recruited for the spirit of competitiveness\".\n\n\u2013 Health-e News\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Morning exercise sessions are improving the health and wellness of Maluti-a-Phofung councillors.
