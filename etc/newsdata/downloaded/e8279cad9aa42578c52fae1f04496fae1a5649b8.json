DJI\u2019s new drone is something of an open secret at this point. We saw an FCC listing for the drone back in August, and DroneDJ published hands on images just last week. But the retailer listing adds credence to those earlier leaks, and prices the diminutive drone at $646.15 Canadian dollars (around $494) when sold with DJI\u2019s Fly More kit.\n\nOne of the more important specs listed on Newegg\u2019s page is the drone\u2019s weight of just 249g. This means that any owners in the US (and soon the UK) won\u2019t have to register this drone with the authorities in order to fly it. Previously, DJI\u2019s lightest Mavic drone was the Mavic Air, which weighs 430g, far above the FAA registration cutoff of 8.8 ounces (250g). Both the retailer listing as well as images leaked earlier this month from DroneDJ show how it\u2019s small enough to sit in the palm of your hand. DroneDJ notes that it has a similar width and height to a smartphone.\n\nFlight time is rated at 30 minutes according to the product listing (which corroborates with DroneDJ\u2019s previous report), and recording resolution apparently tops out at 2.7K rather than 4K, which DroneDJ speculates is an attempt to stop the Mavic Mini from cannibalizing sales of DJI\u2019s Mavic Air or Mavic Pro drones. You can find more pictures of the new drone over on WinFuture.\n\nThe retailer listing doesn\u2019t give any information about when the Mavic Mini might see a release, but with a DJI announcement set to take place at 9am ET on Wednesday, it sounds like we might not have long to wait.\n\nUpdate October 28th, 6:55AM ET: Updated with details of DJI event taking place on Wednesday.", "description": "A retail listing on Newegg\u2019s Canadian store has given us some official images of DJI\u2019s unannounced Mavic Mini.
