One posted a video of a Tesla striking a garage wall and another of a Tesla being struck by a vehicle backing up.\n\n\"Consumers are not getting fully tested, consumer-ready technology,\" Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at the magazine said here in a report on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhat consumers are really getting is the chance to participate in a kind of science experiment.\u201d\n\nA Tesla software update last month added the Smart Summon feature for some customers. When the car is within 200 feet and in their line of sight, they use a phone app to summon the vehicle in a parking lot.\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Tesla Inc's Smart Summon automated parking system is \"glitchy\" and only works intermittently, influential U.S. magazine Consumer Reports has said, adding to recent questions about the app-based feature.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438891820&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981JN-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
