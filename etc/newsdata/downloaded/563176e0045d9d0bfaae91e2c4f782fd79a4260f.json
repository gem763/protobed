Here\u2019s a woman who\u2019s the patron saint of immigrants, who has done so much for New York and the world,\u201d Palminteri said.\n\nHe said she received \u201cdouble the votes\u201d of the second-place selection, Jane Jacobs, who had 93 nominations, but isn\u2019t getting the honor of a statue. \u201cMr. Mayor, how could we just disregard Mother Cabrini and say, \u2018Okay, she\u2019s out and these other seven are in?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe mayor was primed for the fight.\n\nHe asked Lehrer to keep Palminteri on the line so the two could \u201cset the record straight.\u201d\n\nHe then said the actor began his remarks \u201cin the right place\u201d by acknowledging the purpose of McCray\u2019s monument initiative and referenced his own Italian heritage.\n\nBut de Blasio took issue with Palminteri\u2019s characterization of the contest, saying nominations differ from actual votes.\n\n\u201cIt was not an online vote and whoever got the most votes wins,\u201d he said. \u201cThere weren\u2019t even that many votes, honestly.\u201d\n\nPalminteri tried to interrupt but de Blasio scolded him: \u201cChazz, let me finish. Let me finish.\u201d\n\nAfter praising Mother Cabrini as \u201can outstanding figure and absolutely worthy of being honored,\u201d he shifted to the actor\u2019s statement that McCray, who is black, is racist for disfavoring a white nominee.\n\nBut he offered Palminteri an out.\n\n\u201cI want to set something straight with you, personally and I want to make sure \u2026 there\u2019s not a conflict between us because of misreporting by the New York Post,\u201d he said, referencing the conservative tabloid he has been at war with throughout his mayoralty. The Post was actually reporting on quotes Palminteri made to 77 WABC Radio.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve often said the New York Post doesn\u2019t traffic in facts; it tries oftentimes to divide us and it misrepresents,\" the mayor said.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m not going to believe the New York Post. You\u2019re live on the radio. The New York Post says you called my wife, who is a tremendous public servant, who loves people of all backgrounds, who named her children Chiara and Dante and honors their Italian heritage, that you called her a racist,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you would\u2019ve done that, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll tell me the honest truth.\u201d\n\nPalminteri didn\u2019t accept the excuse, saying that \u201cas a man\u201d he could not lie.\n\n\u201cI was asked a question \u2014 do you think that is racism? And I did say the word, 'yes,'\u201d he said. \u201cI did not call her a racist. I never said those words. But they asked me, 'do you think that is racism?' And I said 'well it looks that way.'\u201d\n\n\u201cIf anything, Mr. Mayor, it\u2019s an implicit bias at the least,\u201d he added.\n\nWith that admission, the mayor\u2019s anger shifted.\n\nHe told Palminteri to \u201cget it together.\u201d\n\n\u201cMother Cabrini is going to be talked about in this next round. There\u2019s a great argument for her,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t call someone a racist who isn\u2019t a racist. It just isn\u2019t factually right. And it\u2019s inappropriate and it\u2019s unfair.\u201d\n\nHe also said Palminteri should have \u201cpick[ed] up the godforsaken phone [to] say, \u2018Hey, a lot of us think this is a great idea. Can\u2019t we make this happen?\u2019 And I would\u2019ve said that\u2019s a great idea; let\u2019s get to work on it.\u201d\n\nIn fact, he said he would personally lobby for Mother Cabrini to get a statue in the future. Cabrini was canonized by the Catholic Church in 1946 and is the first U.S. immigrant to be sainted.\n\nIn a further sign of harmony, Palminteri apologized for his comments.\n\nLehrer, who was anxious to cover more ground on weighty issues like a pending vote for the closure of Rikers Island\u2019s jail complex, sought to wrap things up.\n\n\u201cChazz I have to go on to some other calls. I\u2019m sure you understand. I\u2019m going to give you one chance to say after this exchange that you\u2019ve just had with the mayor, do you want to retract the accusation of racism in the selection process or stand by it?\u201d Lehrer asked.\n\n\u201cI would like you to tell your wife I apologize for using the word 'racism,'\u201d Palminteri replied.\n\nIt appeared unlikely the mayor would follow suit.\n\n\u201c@NYCMayor, any apology to the @nypost for falsely accusing us of misreporting @chazzpalminteri's comments?\u201d New York Post City Hall bureau chief Julia Marsh tweeted.\n\nThus far de Blasio has not replied.", "description": "The mayor was primed for the fight.", "authors": ["Sally Goldenberg"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/21/43/28e792124dc1a44a3df2695e4503/101119-chazzpalminteri-getty-1160.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
