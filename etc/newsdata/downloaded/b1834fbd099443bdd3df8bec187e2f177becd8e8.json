UPDATE 5-Oil jumps briefly after reports of Iranian tanker attack\n\n* Iranian tanker on fire near Saudi port city of Jeddah\n\n* Brent and WTI register biggest daily gain since Saudi\n\nattacks\n\n* Prices then recede from session highs, Brent slips below\n\n$60/bbl\n\n* IEA cuts oil demand forecasts\n\n\n\n(Updates prices)\n\nBy Shadia Nasralla\n\nLONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose as high as $60.65\n\na barrel on Friday after Iranian media said a state-owned oil\n\ntanker had been struck by missiles in the Red Sea near Saudi\n\nArabia, but bearish oil demand forecasts soon pulled crude off\n\nsession highs.\n\nThe Iranian Suezmax crude tanker was struck in the Red Sea\n\noff Saudi Arabia's coast on Friday, Iranian media said, with\n\nvarious reports differing on the level of damage caused.\n\nThe National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) said the ship was\n\ndamaged but stable and denied reports it had been set\n\nablaze. Both oil benchmarks recorded their biggest daily rise since\n\nSept. 16, the first trading day after attacks on Saudi\n\ninstallations knocked out more than half of the kingdom's crude\n\noutput and temporarily pushed oil prices up by about 20%.\n\nFriday's initial boost from the Iranian news wore off as\n\ntrading continued. Brent crude futures were up 60 cents\n\nat $59.70 a barrel by 1128 GMT and U.S. West Texas Intermediate\n\n(WTI) crude futures rose 76 cents to $54.31.\n\n\n\nIranian oil exports are under U.S. sanctions that have\n\ndiminished Iran's impact on the global supply picture.\n\n\"The market still has fresh memories of the Saudi Arabia\n\nattacks and the very quick price reversals afterwards. The price\n\nresults of attacks this year have not been sustained in terms of\n\nrisk premium,\" said Petromatrix analyst Olivier Jakob.\n\n\"In terms of oil prices, the impact is limited unless you\n\nthink Iran is going to retaliate in the Strait of Hormuz ...\n\nIt's going to be more supportive in the freight market.\n\nPotentially it can increase insurance premiums (on tankers).\"\n\nThe United States has issued sanctions on units of Chinese\n\nshipper COSCO, alleging involvement in ferrying crude out of\n\nIran, which has boosted rates for oil tankers. Tensions in the Middle East have escalated in the wake of\n\nattacks on tankers and U.S. drones in the Strait of Hormuz, a\n\nkey shipping artery for global oil trade.\n\nKeeping a lid on prices, the International Energy Agency\n\n(IEA) on Friday said that global oil markets had recovered\n\nquickly from the Saudi attacks and even face oversupply next\n\nyear as global demand slows.\n\nTroubled economic prospects for 2020 prompted the IEA to\n\nreduce its forecast for oil demand growth by 100,000 barrels per\n\nday (bpd) to 1.2 million bpd.\n\n\"The market will be weighing this attack against the more\n\nbearish headlines stemming from the IEA's latest monthly oil\n\nmarket report,\" BNP Paribas global oil strategist Harry\n\nTchilinguirian told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.\n\n\n\n\n\nIranian oil tanker Sabiti https://tmsnrt.rs/2B5JJ5q\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 5-Oil jumps briefly after reports of Iranian tanker attack", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPED7K1T0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
