It\u2019s a rare geopolitical consensus in a region still coming to terms with the wars that tore apart the former Yugoslavia a quarter century ago.\n\nThose conflicts continue to haunt Kosovo\u2019s path to the EU and have made it difficult to mend ties with wartime foe Serbia. After talks collapsed last year, the next government\u2019s first decision will be whether and how to get them back on track if either country wants to progress with EU accession. While there are no reliable polls, it\u2019s clear that whoever wins will need to form a coalition to give the government majority support.\n\n\u201cWe need the next government to stabilize relations with Serbia, so that we can start to get integrated into the EU,\u201d said Jeta Citaku, a 34-year-old opera singer sipping an espresso at a cafe in Pristina, the capital. \u201cWe are a young nation that is building its state, and the EU is our passion.\u201d\n\nInternational Recognition\n\nEven if the next administration in Pristina manages to get negotiations back on track, it\u2019ll face a mountain of challenges, including overhauling an economy where output per capita is just over a 10th of the EU average. It also has to retool its courts to EU norms and tackle thorny issues from corruption to human rights.\n\nThen there\u2019s Serbia. After fighting a war in Kosovo until 1999, when North Atlantic Treaty Organization bombers forced its troops out, it has vowed to never recognize an entity many Serbs consider the cradle of their religious and cultural identity.\n\nSince Kosovo unilaterally declared independence in 2008, consecutive Serbian governments have leveraged support from Russia and China to back that stance at the United Nations, a position that five EU members also support.\n\nThe two neighbors looked to be nearing a potential rapprochement when Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and his Kosovar counterpart, Hashim Thaci, floated the idea of a land swap that would allow each side to integrate areas populated by their ethnic kin.\n\nBut even in Kosovo, that plan didn\u2019t win support. It sparked the biggest protest in Pristina\u2019s history and the denouncement from Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, who resigned in July to face an interrogation by a war crimes tribunal. EU leaders also rejected the idea, fearing that redrawing borders would trigger an unpredictable chain of events while stoking simmering tensions.\n\nTalks stalled as Belgrade blocked Kosovo from joining Interpol and Pristina responded with a 100% tax on Serb imports. Serbia has also persuaded 15 countries to withdraw their recognition of Kosovo\u2019s independence.\n\nHaradinaj, the 51-year-old former Kosovo Liberation Army leader twice acquitted of war crimes charges, has since cut ties with his former coalition partner Thaci and is heading into the ballot with his own party.\n\n\u201cThe discussion about the partition of our territory nearly destroyed 20 years of investment into stability of our region,\u201d Haradinaj said in an interview last week. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, as it would reopen the questions of the past.\u201d\n\nWhile all the parties agree on the goal of EU membership and want to end Kosovo\u2019s isolation, Haradinaj\u2019s opponents argue that the nation needs new leaders untainted by the war to achieve that. Self-Determination and the Democratic League of Kosovo have been calling for more drastic measures against corruption.\n\nChance of Victory\n\nThe Self-Determination party, one of the four groups with a chance of victory, agrees with Haradinaj on the land swap and said any concessions are contingent of Serbia recognizing Kosovo.\n\nThat\u2019s put Vucic in a tough spot. He\u2019s balancing between Serbia\u2019s EU aspirations and the nation\u2019s traditional ties with Russia, which under President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly railed against the further expansion of NATO into former communist Europe.\n\nTime\u2019s ticking for both Kosovo and Serbia as they look toward EU entry as a way to root out widespread corruption, bring in foreign investment and boost some of the lowest living standards in Europe. Both are also struggling to staunch a massive exodus of skilled workers that\u2019s undercutting productivity.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- In the volatile Balkans, where impoverished nations are weighing whether to stick to their hope of one day joining the West or accept Russia\u2019s eager embrace, Kosovo has its eyes firmly set on Europe.As the country of 1.9 million heads into Sunday\u2019s snap general elections, all parties set", "authors": ["Jasmina Kuzmanovic", "Rosalind Mathieson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8q6p2qizjTWCUIyjyX1sZQ--~B/aD03MDg7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/71d98c5d3bb449590c915a7a055562b4", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
