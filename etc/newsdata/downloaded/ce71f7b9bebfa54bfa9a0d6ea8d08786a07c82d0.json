The pound was 0.1% against the euro to \u20ac1.1163 (GBPEUR=X) and up 0.3% against the dollar to $1.226 (GBPUSD=X).\n\nThe reversal in fortune came after the Times reported that \u201ca major concession\u201d by allowing Northern Ireland to leave the so-called Irish backstop after a number of years.\n\n\u201cQuoting diplomatic sources close to the talks the Times reported that European governments are prepared to concede a unilateral withdrawal from an interim after a set period of time - with 2025 being touted,\u201d David Cheetham, chief market analyst at trading platform XTB, wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cWhile this appears constructive No 10 has already told the EU that it won\u2019t accept a Northern Ireland only backstop - regardless of a time-limit - and it\u2019s quite feasible that this is little more than posturing and the next move in the Brexit blame game.\u201d\n\nThe report of a possible concession marks a sharp reverse of the mood on Tuesday. Downing Street said a Brexit deal was \u201cessentially impossible\u201d and Irish leader Leo Varadkar said a deal before 31 October would be \u201cvery difficult.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Wednesday morning sterling was down 0.1% against the euro and flat against the dollar at a one-month low.\n\nThe continued pressure on the pound came amid warnings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) about the negative economic impact of Brexit. New IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said in her first speech since landing the top job that Brexit was contributing to a global growth slowdown and Georgieva told the BBC that Brexit would be \u201cpainful\u201d whatever form it takes.\n\n\u201cRight now, the indelicate art of trading sterling against a backdrop of Brexit mayhem and ambivalent economic trends is an exercise in gauging the extent to which risks are relatively priced or overpriced over the crosses,\u201d Ken Odeluga, chief market analyst at City Index, said in an email. \u201cLike Brexit itself, no one would describe the methodology as scientific.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Brexit hits Britain's competitiveness in a major country ranking", "description": "The EU is reportedly ready to make \"a major concession\" ahead of a crucial summit next week.", "authors": ["Oscar Williams-Grut", "Senior City Correspondent", "Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/47jjjyu1nYaWihtbwMaScQ--~B/aD0xNTI5O3c9MjIwMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/28ea0560-ea66-11e9-b7f7-c18e1b91d026", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
