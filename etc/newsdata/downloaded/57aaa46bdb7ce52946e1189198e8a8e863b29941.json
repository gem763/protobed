The platform will also boost the visibility of helplines like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and The Trevor Project.\n\nInstagram launched its policy on graphic images of self-harm in February, following public outcry in the United Kingdom over the death of British teenager Molly Russell, who killed herself after viewing graphic content on the platform.\n\nHer father, Ian Russell, has called out Instagram repeatedly for not doing enough to keep teens from viewing self-harm-related content.\n\nInstagram has removed, reduced the visibility of or added sensitivity screens to more than 834,000 pieces of graphic content since February, Mosseri said.\n\nPeople experiencing suicidal thoughts or urges can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or visit SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for additional resources.", "description": "Instagram on Sunday announced it was expanding its ban on suicide-related content to include fictional depictions of suicide and self-harm.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/instagramlogo_050118getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
