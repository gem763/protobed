They can find them in the Lens wheel when they open the camera in the Snapchat app, or, folks can look to (RED) on social media, where the \"Snapcodes\" are being shared. If on the computer, scan the code with the Snapchat camera and the Lens will open up. Or, if on the phone, there will be a URL link next to the Snapcode that will allow users to open the Lens in Snapchat.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/03/ar-lets-snapchat-bring-artists-work-life-red-aids-campaign/3845339002/", "description": "Snapchat used augmented reality to bring 20 real-world murals including one by the creator of the Obama \"Hope\" poster to viewers wherever they are.", "authors": ["Jefferson Graham", "Published A.M.
