Dolphins coach Brian Flores changed things up Thursday, naming Josh Rosen the team\u2019s starter over Ryan Fitzpatrick for Week 3, according to Ian Rapoport of NFL Network.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nThe 22-year-old Rosen has appeared in both of the Dolphins\u2019 losses this season. In limited time, Rosen has completed eight of 21 passes, for 102 yards and two interceptions.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe move isn\u2019t a surprise considering how poorly the team has played to open the season. Its timing, however, is strange, as Flores stood by Fitzpatrick as his starter hours before making the switch.\n\nAsked if Ryan Fitzpatrick is definite starter Sunday, Flores reiterates that he's the starter \"right now\" \u2014 Barry Jackson (@flasportsbuzz) September 19, 2019\n\nIn his two starts this season, Fitzpatrick, 36, has thrown for one touchdown and four interceptions. The Dolphins have been outscored by 92 points in those two games.\n\nThe change gives Rosen a second opportunity to prove himself in the NFL. Rosen started 13 games for the Arizona Cardinals last season. The former first-round pick completed 55.2 percent of his passes, with 11 touchdowns to 14 interceptions, in those contests.\n\nWhile the opportunity could be huge for Rosen, his situation is less than optimal. After getting sacked 45 times with the Cardinals, Rosen might be playing for an even worse team in 2019.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
