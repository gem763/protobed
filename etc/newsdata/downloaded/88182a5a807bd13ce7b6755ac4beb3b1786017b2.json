But missing the action will be Washington\u2019s most famous transplant resident.\n\nPresident Trump, who has kept a conspicuous distance from baseball since taking office, plans to skip Game 3 between the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros as the series comes to town. He said he would go on Sunday if the best-of-seven contest reaches a fifth game but even then would not throw the first pitch because he would look fat in the Kevlar vest he would have to wear.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. They\u2019re going to have to dress me up in a lot of heavy armor,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ll look too heavy. I don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Mr. Trump has never attended a Major League Baseball game while living in the White House, the first president since 1910 to dispense with an apple-pie tradition that has provided unifying moments even in divisive times. While the rest of the town has reveled in the stunning triumphs of Juan Soto, Howie Kendrick and the once-left-for-dead Nats, as they lead the series, 2-0, Mr. Trump has stayed uncharacteristically quiet.", "description": "The president won\u2019t be at the first World Series game in D.C. since 1933. But he said he would go to Sunday\u2019s game, if there is one, though he has no plans to throw out a ball.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/us/politics/24dc-presidents-01/24dc-presidents-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
