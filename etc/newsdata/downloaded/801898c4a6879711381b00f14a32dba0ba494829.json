Kraig Kahler didn\u2019t meet the standard, and he was convicted and sentenced to be executed.\n\nHis case centers on whether he has a constitutional right to mount an insanity claim, arguing the Kansas law has denied him a fair trial by prohibiting that.\n\nKahler, though, didn\u2019t appear to earn much sympathy Monday from some justices, who peppered his legal counsel with questions about the severity of Kahler\u2019s mental disability and detailed the gruesome nature of his crime.\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. told Kahler\u2019s attorney he had the opportunity to make insanity arguments during the penalty phase \u2014 after he was found guilty, noting the jury chose to impose the death penalty.\n\n\u201cYou have to keep in mind what he did. And this is an intelligent man, and he sneaked up on the house, where his wife and her mother and his children were staying. He killed his ex-wife. He killed his ex, her mother. He executed his two teenage daughters. One of them is heard on the tape crying. He, nevertheless, shot her to death. He spared the son, because he didn\u2019t think the son was siding with the mother,\u201d Justice Alito said.\n\n\u201cAnd then he ran away and turned himself in the next day. Now, this is the stuff from which you\u2019re going to make a defense he didn\u2019t know that what he was doing was morally wrong,\u201d the justice added.\n\nSarah Schrup, Kahler\u2019s attorney, said her client\u2019s use of the insanity defense at the penalty phase isn\u2019t a substitute for being able to argue he was insane during the guilty-or-not guilty part of the trial.\n\nKahler contends he has anxiety and depression but refused to take medication he was prescribed.\n\nMs. Schrup also argued the U.S. has a long history in having the insanity defense used when appropriate, dating to 1791. She pointed to the protections afforded under the Eighth Amendment.\n\n\u201cThe original public meaning of that term was that it would be cruel and unusual to punish the insane,\u201d she told the court.\n\nMost other states allow defendants to show they aren\u2019t criminally liable if they do not know the nature of their act or couldn\u2019t differentiate right from wrong at the time.\n\nKansas says its insanity defense has been modified to focus on a criminal\u2019s intent rather than ability to judge.\n\nThe insanity defense is different from competency to stand trial. A judge will decide whether the accused is of sound-enough mind to go through with the trial. That has no bearing on guilt or innocence.\n\nInsanity, meanwhile, is an argument raised by the defendant during trial, and the jury is asked to make a determination about the accused person\u2019s sanity at the time of the crime.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts Jr. appeared skeptical of whether Kahler\u2019s court filings showed a severe mental disability, rendering him actually insane.\n\nHe noted the court filings suggested Kahler was called a \u201ctightwad\u201d who would borrow instead of buy tools and would thrive on self-importance, trying to portray a perfect marriage.\n\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s not the best way to order your life, but if that\u2019s what you mean by insanity, you can understand why that might cause some reservations,\u201d Justice Roberts said.\n\n\u201cBorrows tools instead of purchasing them? That sounds like the reasonable option,\u201d the chief justice added.\n\nToby Crouse, Kansas\u2019 solicitor general, said the state law doesn\u2019t infringe on constitutional protections and the high court should not strike it down.\n\n\u201cThe states have had historical and traditional discretion to both define the elements of the criminal law, the defenses that are available in those criminal justice proceedings, and the substantive rules at which those defenses and elements are met,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pushed back on the notion there should be a universal rule for the insanity defense handed down by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe high court also heard two other cases Tuesday, one dealing with patent law and the other concerning if the Sixth Amendment warrants a unanimous verdict.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas was absent from the hearings because of an illness.\n\nMultiple media outlets reported he was out with the flu but would participate in the cases once he recovers.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
