The Czech side have been inconsistent in their five qualifier matches so far, picking up three wins and suffering two defeats whilst the Three Lions have a clean slate. But Jaroslav Silhavy\u2019s side have won six of their last eight qualifiers on home soil, losing just once to Turkey in 2015, and the side will be looking to continue this which could make the clash hard for England.\n\nEngland will win this game, and should dominate over the Czech Republic.", "description": "England face the Czech Republic on Friday looking to confirm their place in Euro 2020 next summer.\u00a0 Gareth Southgate\u2019s side currently sit at the top of group A, six points clear of the Czechs who sit in second place.
