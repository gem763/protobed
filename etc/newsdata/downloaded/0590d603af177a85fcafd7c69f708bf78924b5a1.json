Just like choosing a gym or a trainer or a class, it can be pretty daunting to sift through the many fitness apps out there.\n\nHere are five fitness apps guaranteed to keep you focused on being fit through fall. There's a host of new innovative options out there, including audio-guided fitness and live classes built for every fitness goal imaginable.\n\nRUNKEEPER\n\nWith over 50 million users in their running community, Runkeeper not only tracks your runs and workouts, it helps you set realistic goals.

If you choose a workout plan in the app, it will incorporate specific workouts into that plan. An extra benefit of the app is that you can add your own activities and exercises that you might do outside of what the app offers, letting you track your fitness and workouts in a more wholesome way. The app also connects with Apple\u2019s Health app, where you can stay on top of your workouts and Activity Rings.\n\nThe app is free and partners with the Nike+ Run Club app.\n\nNike Inc.\n\nCLASS PASS LIVE\n\nBacked by the popular Class Pass program offered in over 50 cities across the country, Class Pass Live lets you now take these classes wherever you are.

What\u2019s more, no matter if you are taking a live class or an on-demand class, your live metrics and where you land on the leaderboard for your class will still show up.\n\nClass Pass Live offers a 30-day free trial. After that it's $15 a month plus a one-time $70 for the Starter Kit. If you already have a Google Chromecast, the Starter Kit fee is only $40.\n\nClass Pass Live\n\nEditor's Note: This story was originally published on October 2, 2018.", "description": "Like choosing a gym or trainer or class, it can be pretty daunting to sift through the many fitness apps out there.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/fitness-gty-rc-180927_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
