Ukraine sits right between Russia and the European Union and plays a key role moving Russian natural gas to eastern Europe where it is used for electricity, heating and other purposes. In total, the EU receives 40% of its natural gas from Russia (though not all of it comes via Ukraine).\n\nThat supply comes with strings. Russia has used the energy source as a political weapon, occasionally shutting off the gas to threaten and intimidate Ukraine and EU countries. The state-owned Russian firm Gazprom has also targeted Naftogaz directly, withholding billions of dollars in payment in defiance of court rulings. (The relationship between Gazprom, Naftogaz and the EU is currently under negotiation as the contract between Russia and the Ukraine expires in January).In an interview last year, Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev told me that Russia was \u201ctrying to destroy Ukraine\u201d using \u201cmilitary and financial\u201d methods, including by withholding payment. \u201cThe Gazprom behavior is partly dictated by Russia\u2019s desire to dismantle the Ukrainian state,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s in part this behavior that has given the Trump Administration an opening to market U.S. energy products overseas, arguing that U.S. companies are better trading partners than Russian ones. Liquified natural gas has been the most significant focus of this push. In recent years, U.S. natural gas production has reached record levels \u2014 some 92.8 billion cubic feet per day in August, enough to power the U.S. and then some \u2014 as a fracking boom opened up vast new areas to oil and gas drilling.\n\n\u201cThe United States finds ourself in this very unique position,\u201d Energy Secretary Rick Perry said at a press conference in Lithuania Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to develop and to share [our] resources with a with a world that has substantial energy needs.\u201d\n\nAnd, while previous administrations have focused on achieving \u201cenergy independence,\u201d Trump has described his strategy as \u201cenergy dominance.\u201d Perry, in turn, has served as the administration\u2019s chief cheerleader for American natural gas, traveling across eastern Europe to promote the product.\n\n\u201cU.S. gas is going to be competitive with anybody in the world,\u201d Perry said in Lithuania. \u201cWho do you want to buy your gas from: a country who has a record of cutting that gas off from time to time to meet their political needs or from the United States?\u201d\n\nEuropean countries have been receptive to U.S. natural gas with a handful of countries including Spain and the Netherlands importing it from the U.S. In Russia\u2019s backyard, Poland took its first delivery of U.S. LNG, short for liquified natural gas, this year and Lithuania is building infrastructure for that purpose now.\n\nExperts note that the American product still struggles to compete with the low cost of Russian natural gas. \u201cU.S. gas can be a factor,\u201d says Richard Kauzlarich, director of the Center for Energy Science and Policy at George Mason University and a former U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan. \u201cAssuming the price is right.\u201d\n\nBut the Oct. 7 report from the AP suggests that a group of American businessmen wanted to interfere in the market and took the Ukraine LNG lobbying push further. The businessmen \u2014 Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman and Harry Sargeant III \u2014 allegedly tried to replace Kobolyev as the CEO of Naftogaz and planned to broker a deal to sell their own natural gas to the company.", "description": "Naftogaz, a transporter of gas between Russia and the EU, is at the center of legitimate policy goals and allegations of a pressure campaign", "authors": ["Justin Worland"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KcleEDyfvybRPUtPcX7djA--~B/aD0yODAwO3c9NDIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/c2fe571b5a5f3f92d7f24e3b3ab13de5", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
