That was the first drop since February.\n\nData for August was revised up to show retail sales gaining 0.6% instead of 0.4% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would climb 0.3% in September. Compared to September last year, retail sales increased 4.1%.\n\nExcluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales were unchanged last month after advancing by an unrevised 0.3% in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.\n\nLast month's drop and August's unrevised gain in core retail sales likely suggest a much more significant slowdown in consumer spending in the third quarter than economists had been anticipating after a surge in the prior quarter.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, increased at a 4.6% annualized rate in the second quarter, the most in 1-1/2 years. Signs the economy's growth engine was sputtering could further stoke financial market fears of a sharper slowdown in economic growth.\n\nU.S. stock index futures extended losses after the release of the data. Yields on U.S. Treasuries were trading lower while the dollar was largely unchanged against a basket of currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nBROAD WEAKNESS\n\nThough President Donald Trump announced a temporary truce in the trade war with China last Friday, which delayed additional tariffs that were due this month, economists say the longest economic expansion on record remained in danger without all import duties being rolled back.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that the U.S.-China trade war would cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and expressed caution over Trump's so-called Phase 1 trade deal, saying more details were needed.\n\nGrowth is also being restricted by the fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package.\n\nWith consumer spending slowing, a full trade deal still elusive and the likelihood of a disorderly exit from the European Union by Britain, many economists expect the Fed to cut interest rates at its Oct. 29-30 policy meeting to keep the expansion, now in its 11th year, on track.\n\nThe U.S. central bank cut rates in September after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increased at a 1.7% annualized rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the April-June quarter, slowing from the first quarter's brisk 3.1% rate. The government will publish its snapshot of third-quarter GDP at the end of the month.\n\nAuto sales fell 0.9 percent in September, the most in eight months, after accelerating 1.9% in August. Receipts at service stations fell 0.7%, likely reflecting cheaper gasoline.\n\nSales at electronics and appliance stores were unchanged, getting no boost from the launch of Apple's new iPhone model. Sales at building material stores fell 1.0%. Online and mail-order retail sales dropped 0.3%, the most since December 2018. That followed a 1.2% increase in August. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores dipped 0.1%.\n\nBut receipts at clothing stores rebounded 1.3% last month after falling 0.7% in August. Sales at furniture stores increased 0.6%. Sales at restaurants and bars gained 0.2%.
