Mitt Romney (R-Utah) is running for president again \u2014 at least in Anthony Scaramucci's dreams.\n\nThe famously short-lived White House communications director has since turned on the president who appointed him, and has publicly said he's trying to knock President Trump off the 2020 ticket. Now, it seems Scaramucci has decided on his dream candidate, and has launched a website and line of T-shirts to persuade him to run.\n\nScaramucci started making his support for Romney known earlier this month, tweeting a poll that showed the 2012 GOP nominee beating the presumptive 2020 nominee in a hypothetical primary. He then revealed last week he'd launched Mitt2020.org, and on Sunday night, showed off that the site was offering \"commit to Mitt\" campaign T-shirts. They are being sold at $20.20 each to \"test demand,\" and so far Scaramucci has seen an \"overwhelming\" response, he told ABC News.\n\nWhile Romney hasn't even hinted at granting Scaramucci's wishes, the \"Mitt Happens\" shirt is sure to be a collector's item in a few years.", "description": "Sen.
