In addition, more than 99 percent of content the tech giant takes action against is identified by machine learning and algorithms, rather than reports from actual users.\n\nFACEBOOK FACT-CHECKING TO EXEMPT OPINION AND SATIRE\n\n\"We believe people have the right to have a private conversation online, wherever they are in the world. As the U.S. and U.K. governments acknowledge, the CLOUD Act allows for companies to provide available information when they receive valid legal requests and does not require companies to build back doors,\" a Facebook spokesperson told Fox News via email on Thursday.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe company spokesperson said the tech giant is consulting with child safety experts, governments and tech companies ahead of its plan to bring more security to its messaging apps.\n\n\"End-to-end encryption already protects the messages of over a billion people every day. It is increasingly used across the communications industry and in many other important sectors of the economy,\" the Facebook spokesperson said. \"We strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere.\u201d\n\nFox News' Nicole Darrah and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.", "description": "Attorney General William Barr is demanding that Facebook stop its plan for end-to-end encryption across its messaging services.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Zuckerberg-split.jpg"}
