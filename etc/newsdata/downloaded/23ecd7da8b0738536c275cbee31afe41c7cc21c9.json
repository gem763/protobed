(Silas Walker/Getty Images)\n\nTennessee wide receiver Jordan Murphy, who retweeted a joke about his team\u2019s stunning 38-30 loss Saturday to Georgia State, is leaving the program, Volunteers Coach Jeremy Pruitt said during Wednesday\u2019s Southeastern Conference coaches\u2019 teleconference.\n\nMurphy did not play in the upset loss against the Football Championship Subdivision squad that went 2-10 in 2018. Pruitt said on Monday that the junior wideout, who caught 11 passes for 155 yards and a touchdown in 10 games last season, had been sick over the past week.\n\nEarlier this week, Murphy retweeted a joke poking fun at the Vols\u2019 loss and the fact that the winning team also received $950,000 to play them. Murphy replied with the comment, \u201cman y\u2019all can\u2019t tell me this ain\u2019t funny.\u201d He later deleted the tweet and temporarily deactivated his account after drawing the ire of angry Volunteers fans.\n\nTennessee\u2019s Jordan Murphy tweeted this after the UT loss\n\n\n\nIt isn\u2019t going over well with Vol fans pic.twitter.com/EJ3Wuzbryl \u2014 Matt Jones (@KySportsRadio) September 2, 2019\n\nHe has since reactivated his account and has been retweeting both supporters and those who are still angry with him for making light of the memorable loss.\n\nOne supportive note may have shed some light on Murphy\u2019s decision to leave the Volunteers. In a tweet that tagged Murphy, the user posted, \u201cHe had to endure the biggest loss anyone can have as a teen his mom passed while at TN \u2026\u201d\n\nMurphy then replied, \u201cThank you ma.\u201d\n\nPruitt confirmed that defensive back Terrell Bailey is also leaving the program. Bailey, a redshirt sophomore from New Orleans, also didn\u2019t play against Georgia State. He appeared in nine games as a backup outside linebacker and special teams contributor in 2018. Pruitt said both players chose to leave the program.\n\nGeorgia State\u2019s win over Tennessee was its first over a Power Five team since the program launched in 2010.\n\nTo rub salt in the wound, one Georgia State player said this week that a fellow FCS opponent will be a more difficult challenge than the SEC\u2019s Volunteers.\n\n\u201cI think (Furman) will give us a tougher battle than we faced Saturday, if you want to be honest,\u201d safety Remy Lazarus told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day we won, they lost,\u201d Panthers quarterback Dan Ellington said Monday. \u201cWe were just the better team. We went out and played and had a lot of fun that day I don\u2019t think they had a lot of fun. I know their fans didn\u2019t have fun.\u201d\n\nMore college sports:\n\nYour college football team rolled in its opener.
