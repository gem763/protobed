But we will supply the court with a transcript from the Inner House hearing. The hearing tomorrow will go ahead.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018But the PM has made the request for an extension he promised he wouldn\u2019t make, the EU is considering that request, and the question whether the PM and Advocate General for Scotland are in contempt of court is one for the Inner House.\u2019\n\nDuring the case\u2019s first hearing on October 9, the Government\u2019s lawyers assured the court that Mr Johnson would adhere to the law in writing and before the judges \u2013 despite the Prime Minister\u2019s repeated public declarations that he would never request an extension.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the three judges find Mr Johnson has failed to uphold the law, they could find him in contempt, with potential punishments including a fine or even a jail sentence.\n\nThe unsigned Brexit extension letter from Boris Johnson to Donald Tusk (Picture: Twitter)\n\nEU Commission president Donald Tusk confirmed at 10pm on Saturday that he had received the Prime Minister\u2019s request, tweeting: \u2018The extension request has just arrived. I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.\u2019\n\nMr Broccoli revealed as gas-guzzling Mercedes van driver\n\nIn his signed letter, Mr Johnson wrote: \u2018A further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us.\u2019\n\nThe letter, to Mr Tusk and copied to European Council president Jean-Claude Juncker, references his regret at being defeated over the Letwin amendment in the House of Commons on Saturday.\n\nIt states: \u2018Regrettably, Parliament missed the opportunity to inject momentum into the ratification process for the new Withdrawal Agreement.\u2019\n\nMPs voted by 322 to 306 in favour of amending the Brexit deal in order to withhold the Commons\u2019 approval until the necessary UK legislation to leave the EU has been passed. The Government\u2019s response was to cancel Saturday\u2019s vote on the deal, with it expected to be brought back before MPs during the week.\n\nBoris sent a second letter to the EU saying he does not want a delay (Picture: AFP)\n\nJoanna Cherry QC, an SNP MP who has been involved in bringing proceedings to court, described Mr Johnson\u2019s actions as a \u2018childish trick of not signing the letter and sending a contradictory covering letter\u2019.\n\nBritain's biggest family reveal they are expecting baby number 22\n\nShe added: \u2018Our legal team are instructed to remind the court that as well as promising to comply with the letter of the Benn Act, the PM also promised not to seek to frustrate the purpose of the legislation.\n\n\u2018It will be for the court to decide whether his actions in failing to sign the letter of request and sending a letter setting out his contrary intentions are in breach of the undertakings he gave them or a contempt of court.\u2019", "description": "Boris Johnson sent a letter asking for an extension that he didn't sign and a second one saying a delay would be a mistake.", "authors": ["Richard Hartley-Parkinson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Boris-letter-cc63_1571640629.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
