Recently, members of Mexico\u2019s Senate aligned with the ruling party MORENA called for an impeachment inquiry against Cabeza De Vaca, claiming cartel violence in his region is out of control.\n\nAccording to Cabeza de Vaca, federal agencies like the National Executive Secretariat for Public Safety are recording a dramatic drop in crime in Tamaulipas\u2013 violence in particular\u2013placing the state as the twentieth-most dangerous out of 32.\n\n\u201cWe are not talking about the first, second, or third most dangerous\u2013we are talking about the twentieth,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they wanted to look at the more dangerous ones, they would need to look at other states first.\u201d\n\nThe decrease in crime comes at a time when Mexico City is moving away from fighting head-on with cartels. Federal Police and military forces were missing from many of the recent shootouts as a result. The lack of effort led Gov. Cabeza de Vaca to publicly claim that state cops were the only ones fighting.\n\nOne of the allegations made by the MORENA senators is that a group of Tamaulipas State Police kidnapped and murdered innocent men before staging a shootout with fake cartel gunmen in the border city of Nuevo Laredo. A local cartel-connected \u201chuman rights\u201d group first leveled that accusation in favor of the Cartel Del Noreste faction of Los Zetas.\n\n\u201cThat is fake news \u2026 legitimate human rights organizations should be denouncing this because these types of cases will affect the credibility of real organizations,\u201d said Nelson Balido, the Chairman of the Border and Security Council (BSC), a non-profit that focuses on international commerce during an interview with Breitbart Texas. In his role with the BSC, Balido works with Tamaulipas and U.S. officials to improve international cooperation.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing is called a \u2018psyop.\u2019 They are manipulating information to influence emotions and change opinions,\u201d Balido argued.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
