He sounds like he is in so much pain. I have been with him for 24 years and never seen in this kind of situation. It's awful, really scary,' she said.\n\nOne of the fighters with Fenech - Brock Jarvis - called Mrs Fenech to tell her what had happened.\n\nThe team of boxers is set to return on Tuesday - but Mrs Fenech doesn't believe her husband will make that flight.\n\nThe family desperately want him home to attend Jessica's wedding.", "description": "Jeff Fenech, 55, was at a boxing training camp in Thailand when he was hospitalised with pneumonia.
