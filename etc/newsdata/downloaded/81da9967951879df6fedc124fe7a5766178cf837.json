It appears that if you commit a crime you are better supported.\n\n\"The impact this has had on my mental health has been pretty horrific. My feelings have never been taken into consideration.\"\n\nKatrice disappeared at a supermarket with her mother Sharon on an Army base in Paderborn, Germany, where her Sergeant Major father was stationed.\n\nAlmost four decades on, Katrice has not been found, despite a string of searches in the German town and an arrest being made last month in connection with the disappearance.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nRobinson became the latest in a string of heartless people impersonating Katrice.\n\nBut the defendant, from Wirral, Merseyside, claimed she suffered psychosis and genuinely thought she was Katrice.\n\nSpeaking after a previous hearing, Robinson said: \"I actually believed completely that I was Katrice.\n\n(Image: Mercury Press & Media)\n\n\"I'd had mental health issues leading up to the situation.\n\n\"I was then at the time experiencing what I now know to be psychosis.\n\n\"I really didn't intend to hurt the family but as I know my actions have done that, I am deeply sorry and that is why I have pleaded guilty.\n\n\"I am now getting help and I apologise sincerely to the Lee family and my family.\"", "description": "Heidi Robinson, who featured in Real Housewives of Cheshire, was responsible for an act of \"unimaginable cruelty\" after sending messages to the family of Katrice Lee", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Mercury Press", "Media", "Julian Hamilton Daily Mirror", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20558555.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Child-impersonator-Heidi-Robinson-in-court.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
