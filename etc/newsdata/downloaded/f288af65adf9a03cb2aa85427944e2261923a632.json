Speculation is rife that he's been using Raya, the exclusive dating app for celebrities, athletes and other elite rich people types \u2014 and now the 47-year-old actor is using that rumor to his advantage, and to do some good.\n\n\"HA, you got me. I\u2019m dating,\" he wrote in an Instagram post. \"But let\u2019s be serious for a moment and talk about something that is actually important. I have been in recovery for over a year and part of that is helping out others. @themidnightmission is an incredible organization that helps those in need with housing, training, development and recovery. I\u2019m making a donation today because there are people battling addiction every day that don\u2019t have the resources and need help.\"\n\nHe invited his followers to join him in supporting the charity, and jokingly added: \"@raya, you in? Who else is with me? Click the link in my bio to donate.\"\n\nAffleck revealed in October last year that he had completed a 40 day stay in rehab for alcohol addiction. \"Battling any addiction is a lifelong struggle,\" he said in a statement at the time. \"Because of that, one is never really in or out of treatment. It is a full-time commitment.\"\n\n\"With acceptance and humility, I continue to avail myself with the help of so many people and I am grateful to all those who are there for me. I hope down the road I can offer an example to others who are struggling.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "He may or may not be on Raya, but Affleck just asked the dating app to make a donation to The Midnight Mission anyway.", "authors": ["Philip Ellis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qKfCQXaSaaYBI_vPnEnEWg--~B/aD0xMTI4O3c9MjI1MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_mens_health_171/188feedb6a275f8d428672fa0cf69717", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
