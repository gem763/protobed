REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage/File Photo\n\nThe announcement did not single out any utilities by name, but the bulk of \u201cpublic safety power shut-offs\u201d under scrutiny were implemented by Pacific Gas and Electric Co, a unit of PG&E Corp (PCG.N), California\u2019s largest investor-owned utility.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January, citing $30 billion in civil liability from major wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018, including last year\u2019s Camp Fire, which killed 85 people and incinerated most of the Northern California town of Paradise. That fire ranks as the state\u2019s deadliest on record.\n\nResponding to the latest windstorms over the weekend, PG&E turned off electricity to 970,000 homes and workplaces in 37 counties in northern and central California, encompassing millions of people across more than half of PG&E\u2019s service area of 70,000 square miles.\n\nThat tally far surpassed the previous record planned outage of 730,000 customers during high winds two weeks ago.\n\nEven as PG&E crews scrambled on Monday to inspect power lines and restore electricity after winds subsided, the utility announced plans for yet another round of shut-offs expected to leave as many as 605,000 customers off the grid on Tuesday and Wednesday, when extreme winds are forecast to return.\n\nThe company, which has defended the mass outages as a matter of public safety, said it had logged more than 20 preliminary reports of damage to its system from the most recent windstorm.\n\nThe precautionary blackouts have drawn sharp criticism from the governor and state regulators as being too widespread and disruptive, as well as poorly managed and communicated.\n\n\u2018HELD TO ACCOUNT\u2019\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has said PG&E is largely to blame, arguing that corporate greed and mismanagement kept the utility from upgrading its infrastructure while wildfire hazards have steadily worsened over the past decade.\n\nHe has vowed that PG&E and other utilities would be \u201cheld to account\u201d for their lapses by the new California Public Utilities Commission president he appointed in July, Marybel Batjer.\n\nThe agency\u2019s statement on Monday said its safety and enforcement division will ask commissioners in the next 30 days to open an investigation of the outages.\n\nThe inquiry will examine utility compliance with agency regulations, as well as \u201cany resulting violations\u201d and potential penalties, the statement said.\n\nFines of up to $100,000 per violation per day and additional penalties can be assessed for violations, agency spokesman Christopher Chow said. PG&E was previously slapped with a record $1.6 billion penalty for a deadly 2010 gas pipeline explosion in San Bruno, California.\n\nBatjer also plans to reevaluate protocols for precautionary outages and how utilities can minimize them.\n\nResponding to the commission, PG&E said, \u201cWe are constantly working to minimize the impact of these safety shut-offs while prioritizing public safety.\u201d It said the blackouts\u2019 only purpose \u201cis to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire in the communities that we serve.\u201d\n\nPG&E acknowledged last week that a major wildfire in Sonoma County wine country erupted near a damaged a transmission tower owned by the utility at about the time a live high-voltage line carried by that tower malfunctioned.", "description": "California regulators said on Monday they will open a formal probe of whether utilities violated any rules by cutting power to millions of residents for days as a precaution during recent periods of high winds and heightened wildfire risks.", "authors": ["Steve Gorman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445996137&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1NH", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
