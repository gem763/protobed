But they may have been given a political gift this past week when Democrats doubled down on their pursuit of an impeachment investigation against President Trump.\n\nThe move came after Republicans already were enjoying a dose of good news on the congressional campaign front: the party's narrow win in the special congressional election in North Carolina. The National Republican Congressional Committee touted that the \u201cvictory is yet another sign that congressional Republicans are poised to take back the majority.\u201d\n\nDEMS ADMIT TRUMP HELPED GOP SWEEP SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS IN NORTH CAROLINA\n\nA day later, the House Judiciary Committee took a step with potentially bigger implications -- approving a resolution defining the panel's impeachment probe, in the first official vote on the matter.\n\nMore than half of Democratic lawmakers in the House support launching impeachment proceedings. Yet considering the GOP-controlled Senate is unlikely to act on any possible impeachment articles from the House, moderate Democrats in the House loudly warned that their colleagues are walking into a political trap.\n\nThose facing tough reelections next year in districts Trump captured in 2016 specifically raised flags that impeachment could hurt the party\u2019s efforts to defend its 235-199 majority (there\u2019s one independent House member) in the chamber.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Anthony Brindisi told Fox News on Thursday that he\u2019s concerned. \u201cI\u2019m worried that as the investigation ramps up, it takes up time from other issues.\u201d\n\nAnd the congressman \u2013 who represents a red district \u2013 said he \u201cwould vote no [on impeachment], unless there is something compelling that comes out.\u201d\n\nHOUSE DEMS AREN'T ACTUALLY IMPEACHING THE PRESIDENT - YET\n\nRep. Donna Shalala of Florida, who flipped her Miami area district from red to blue in last year\u2019s midterm elections, told reporters that impeachment is \u201csucking the air out of all the good stuff that we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nAnd she warned that it\u2019s \u201cdifficult\u201d for House Democrats to focus on issues crucial to their voters \u201cgiven the platform.\u201d Shalala spotlighted that she only fielded four impeachment questions during a total of 11 town halls in her district during the recent congressional recess.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii \u2013 who doesn\u2019t support impeachment \u2013 cautioned last week that \u201cit\u2019s important for us to think about what is in the best interest of the country and the American people.\u201d\n\nAnd in an interview on \"Full Court Press with Greta Van Susteren,\" the Democratic presidential candidate argued that \u201ccontinuing to pursue impeachment is something that I think will only further tear our country apart.\u201d\n\nWhile Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler pledged \u201can aggressive series of hearings\u201d and said his panel\u2019s conducting an impeachment inquiry, Pelosi and other Democratic House leaders \u2013 mindful of more moderate members facing challenging reelections \u2013 have largely refrained from using that terminology. Speaking with reporters, Pelosi avoided using the term \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nWhile the Judiciary Committee\u2019s move could be a gift to the House GOP, a national Democratic strategist who works on House races cautioned that \u201cRepublicans are getting ahead of themselves if they think 2020 is going to be decided on the basis of impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe strategist, who asked for anonymity to speak more freely, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the American public\u2019s perception has really shifted. If you ask the average voter, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re differentiating between what the Judiciary Committee was doing last week and what they\u2019re doing this week. That\u2019s very, very insider and probably half the people in D.C. that you talk to wouldn\u2019t even be able to tell you the difference. I think that they\u2019re reading too much into that.\u201d\n\nThe Judiciary Committee vote comes with 15 House Republicans now heading for the exit door in 2020. And only two of those GOP lawmakers are launching statewide bids for governor or senator. The rest are truly retiring. That\u2019s a switch from two years ago \u2013 when at the same point in the 2018 cycle, nine of the 14 House Republicans not running for reelection were bidding for higher office. The Democrats, thanks to a 40-seat pickup in the midterms, regained the majority after eight years as backbenchers.\n\nBy contrast, only four House Democrats so far this cycle have said they\u2019re not running for reelection.\n\n\u201cFor many of these Republicans, it\u2019s the first time being in the minority and being in the minority in the House is a tough place to be. You have to be responsive to an ever-present president and defend him, which is not fun,\u201d noted Ty Matsdorf, a veteran Democratic strategist who recently served as independent expenditure director at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nLooking at the recent spate of GOP House retirements, Matsdorf said: \u201cIt\u2019s always a good indicator of more to come when you see waves like this, because it tells you that there\u2019s something systemically wrong.\u201d\n\nAnd Matsdorf predicted that between now and January we\u2019ll see the \u201cbulk of the rest of the Republican retirements.\u201d\n\nLongtime Republican strategist Colin Reed concurred that \u201cnobody likes being in the minority. It\u2019s just a reality of life.\u201d\n\nAnd he noted that \u201ctypically when the control of the lower chambers switches hands, you can see an exodus of retirements in the ensuing years as former chairs get used to life as ranking members of the minority.\u201d\n\nReed acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s indisputable that the retirements in recent weeks have not been helpful to the Republican cause.\u201d He argued that the party reclaiming the majority remains unlikely.\n\nOnly a handful of the House GOP retirements are in swing districts, however. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican, told reporters on Friday, \"Let me be very frank. I'm not concerned about any retirement.\"\n\nHe then added one exception -- retiring Rep. Will Hurd of Texas. Democrats are eyeing the seat as a potential pickup.\n\nMcCarthy spoke three days after Republican Dan Bishop\u2019s victory Tuesday in a special election in North Carolina, which was touted by pundits as a bellwether of things to come in 2020, gave the GOP a much-needed boost.\n\nBut his narrow margin over Democrat Dan McCready in a district where the GOP has a distinct advantage didn\u2019t erase fears that House Republicans are still facing fierce headwinds in 2020.\n\nMatsdorf argued that if Bishop had lost, it would have sparked a flood of House GOP retirements. He noted that the Republican victory in the special election \u201cwill slow the retirements, but not completely because this is a Republican seat.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nReed downplayed the impact of the contest, saying he \u201chesitates to place much emphasis on special elections. I think political prognosticators make too much of extrapolating outcomes of special elections.\u201d\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.", "description": "House Republicans\u00a0are facing a steep climb to regain the majority in 2020, as mounting retirements in the party complicate their efforts to wrest the gavel from Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
