They capitalised on some good fortune when Lucas Torreira was clearly offside as he converted a rebound from the hugely impressive Mesut Ozil\u2019s shot.\n\nBut that sparked an onslaught, with the exciting Gabriel Martinelli scoring twice in quick succession, putting another rebound in before he turned in a fine cross from young prospect Bukayo Saka.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAll three goals came from mistakes - surprisingly from senior players like Oxlade-Chamberlain and Origi, but Elliott atoned for one of his just before the interval when he darted into the box and went down - rather theatrically - as Martinelli touched his foot. Milner made no mistake from the spot.\n\nThere was to be no let up. Arsenal scored again minutes after the break, when Milner, the oldest man on the pitch, gave the ball away in his own box, and Maitland-Niles found the net after a brilliantly aware Ozil back heel.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nBut Oxlade-Chamberlain atoned for his earlier error with an incredible strike against his former club on 57 minutes, and then Origi followed suit in making good, this time with an audacious turn on the edge of the box.\n\n62 minutes, the score 4-4 and the Kop chanting we want more. They got it.\n\nWillock ran from half way to seemingly win it, but then came the grandstand finish, a cross from Williams and outstanding athleticism on the half turn from Origi.\n\nA timeless goal in a timeless classic.", "description": "LIVERPOOL 5-5 ARSENAL (5-4 pens): One of Anfield's own landed the final blow in an outrageous Carabao Cup clash", "authors": ["David Maddock", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Robbie Stephenson Jmp Rex", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20761900.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-v-Arsenal-UK-30-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
