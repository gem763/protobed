Limachi says that waste from El Alto and a lack of understanding about pollution risk changing the habitat forever. \"It is also our fault, people throw garbage and plastic everywhere, they don't understand this is polluting,\" he says, adding that many plant varieties in the lake had already vanished. \"Fish used to live, eat and lay their eggs amongst these plants. Now there are no plants, so no fish,\" he says. \"We are afraid that someday the fish will disappear or migrate forever.\" REUTERS/Manuel Seoane\n\nClose", "description": "A destroyed boat is seen at a devastated hotel after Hurricane Dorian hit the Abaco Islands in Marsh Harbour, Bahamas, September 5, 2019.
