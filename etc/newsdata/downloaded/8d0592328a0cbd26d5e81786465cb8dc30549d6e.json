While there is some overlap in the programming languages used to develop conventional software and technology for blockchain platforms, the workflows and skills required to create a successful project are radically different.\n\nMaintaining a public blockchain is by no means an easy task. The code created needs to be absolutely bulletproof \u2014 not least because security vulnerabilities can and have been exploited by hackers. This slows down the process substantially because developers need to make sure that every loophole is addressed.\n\nProgramming languages are instrumental in ensuring blockchain networks run smoothly and transactions are executed with precision. To achieve automation, smart contracts are often used. When predetermined conditions are met, code enables these agreements between parties to be executed automatically. The incentive here is that it eliminates middlemen \u2014 eradicating the need for lawyers or notaries. That said, it can take intensive levels of coding to get them right.\n\nOther blockchain uses include the development of decentralized applications (DApps) and the execution of crowdfunding initiatives.", "description": "Programming languages are crucial for blockchain \u2014 for usability, security and durability", "authors": ["Connor Blenkinsop"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1024_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZmFkZGNkMTEyZTM0MmQyNmM4NzkyZDg1ZTE5MmFjYzIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
