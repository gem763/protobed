There is no measure to my pain.\"\n\nIn response to the letter, rights group Amnesty UK called on Tehran to free the mother.\n\n\"It's time for Iran to end this cruel punishment,\" it said.", "description": "The husband of a British-Iranian mother jailed in Tehran since 2016 says the couple's decision to send their five-year-old daughter to him in Britain to start school is \"bittersweet\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6830/d03202af27ec4518847e32af0ce08695.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
