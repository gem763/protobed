Ron Wyden (D-OR) said. \u201cApple just sided with them.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Apple rejected the app, HKmap.live, from the App Store, but it reversed that decision only a few days later and made it available for download. As of Thursday, it\u2019s been taken out of the store, basically reversing the original reversal.\n\n\u201cApple assured me last week that their initial decision to ban this app was a mistake,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) tweeted. \u201cLooks like the Chinese censors have had a word with them since. Who is really running Apple? Tim Cook or Beijing?\u201d\n\n\u201cApple just sided with\u201d China\n\nOther Republicans like Sens. Rick Scott (FL) and Tom Cotton (AR) voiced similar sentiments, calling for Apple to stand up to \u201cCommunist China.\u201d\n\n\u2066\u201dApple\u2069 is yet another capitalist who\u2019ll sell rope to communists to hang us,\u201d Cotton said.\n\nIn a statement explaining the company\u2019s decision to remove the app, Apple said that it had learned that it was \u201cused in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong.\u201d For that reason, Apple said that it violated its rules and local laws and had to be removed.\n\nThe developers of HKmap responded to removal saying, \u201cHKmap App never solicits, promotes, or encourages criminal activity. HKmap App consolidates information from user and public sources, e.g. live news stream, Facebook and Telegram.\u201d\n\nOver the past week, lawmakers who are typically tough on China, like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Wyden, and Hawley have all put out statements condemning American companies and institutions for banning speech unfavorable toward Beijing.\n\nOn Monday, Blizzard banned a professional Hearthstone player for voicing support for the Hong Kong protests, and China\u2019s state broadcaster said it would stop showing Houston Rockets games after a team manager tweeted, \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d The tweet has since been deleted.", "description": "Apple rejected the app, HKmap.live, from the App Store, but it reversed that decision only a few days later and made it available for download.
