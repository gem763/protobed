The colours are bright and beautiful, the fabrics used are high quality and the cuts stylish yet flattering for all shapes and sizes. We especially like how the swimsuits are sold specifically for your cup size, tailoring the fit further. They\u2019re incredibly comfy and supportive to swim or do beach sports in and made in east London from ECONYL sustainable fabric. A fantastic buy that is available in different colourways and up to a size 20.\n\nBuy now\n\nNike Swim digi arrow women\u2019s powerback swimsuit: \u00a333.99, Pro Swimwear\n\nThis digi arrow swimsuit from Nike Swim is a great choice for swimmers, especially those who want to go fast. Streamlined, with a snug fit and racer back-design, we found it comfortable to wear in the pool or sea, even for extended periods of time. The fabric felt durable and good value for the price. However, this doesn\u2019t have support in the chest, so it\u2019s less suited to active beach sports and running than other swimsuits we tested.\n\nBuy now\n\nVolcom simply solid logo surfsuit: \u00a370, ASOS\n\nA cross between a swimming costume and a rash vest, this hybrid from Volcom would be a really good choice for surfers. We liked that you could catch waves, swim and generally be active on the beach, without worrying about your swimsuit flying up or off. We also liked the UV protection this suit would give your upper body, and that it was made from recycled fishing nets. It does have a high cut on the rear though, which didn\u2019t entirely fit with the sporty vibe. Available in sizes 8-14.\n\nBuy now\n\nTide and Seek aqua marble surf bralette & bikini bottoms: \u00a335 top, \u00a332 bottoms, Tide and Seek\n\nWe liked the marbled design and pretty straps on the back of this Tide and Seek bikini. It had the least coverage of the swimsuits on test and the support was light, but it still stayed in place pretty well for gentle beach exercise and swimming, though it wouldn\u2019t be a swimsuit you\u2019d want to run or dive into serious waves in. We liked that it was made from Repreve fabric, which is 100 per cent made from recycled plastic bottles. If you\u2019re not keen on this colourway, there are others available.\n\nBuy bralette now\n\nBuy bottoms now\n\nEllesse pomum bikini top & malus bikini pant: \u00a312 top, \u00a37.20 bottoms, Ellesse\n\nWe liked the bright colours and sporty look of this Ellesse bikini. The coverage was moderate, as opposed to skimpy, and it was the cheapest bikini on test. But we didn\u2019t find the support especially strong, nor did the fabric feel particularly durable. But this is a good on-trend holiday choice for light swimming and gentle beach exercise.\n\nBuy top now\n\nBuy bottoms now\n\nRoxy Fitness athletic triangle bikini top and full bikini bottoms: \u00a324.50 top, \u00a322.40 bottoms, Roxy\n\nSurfing in a bikini can be a real challenge, but we were impressed with the hold and support provided by the cross-back design on this Roxy bikini. It was also really comfy to wear while messing about in the waves and swimming, though it probably wouldn\u2019t be supportive enough for running in. We liked the palm print and the cut of both the top and bottoms was flattering. The bottoms certainly weren\u2019t skimpy, though they weren\u2019t necessarily the \u201cfull coverage\u201d advertised by the brand either. Overall, a good value, nice-looking choice.\n\nBuy top now\n\nBuy bottoms now\n\nSpeedo reflect wave crop top and sport short: \u00a340 top, \u00a325 brief, Speedo\n\nIf a core swim brand such as Speedo designs a fitness-specific range, you\u2019d expect it to perform well and this set did exactly that. The chest support was the strongest we tried; it felt like a sports bra you could run, take a beach workout class in or even race a triathlon in. The bottoms were similarly supportive with a firm waistband to hold them in place. It\u2019s a performance product and flattering in an athletic way, but probably not something you\u2019d want to wear all day while lounging around the pool. The top came with removable pads. An alternative tank top is available in this style, as are sports brief-style or board short-style bottoms.\n\nBuy top now\n\nBuy shorts now\n\nBody Glove Samoa Penelope halter swim top and pulse cross-over short: \u00a360 top, \u00a350 shorts, Body Glove\n\nWhen we first put this Body Glove bikini top on we got in a slight tangle with the straps but once it was on it was comfy, flattering and really supportive to swim and run around in. The shorts were also super comfy and flattering but weren\u2019t quite as robust in the sea. They lack an inner layer which can leave you feeling feel slightly exposed, but they\u2019d be fine for gentle swimming and we liked running in them. The top can be matched with a more traditional bikini-style bottom.\n\nBuy top now\n\nBuy shorts now\n\nNabaiji loran women\u2019s one-piece tankini swimsuit: \u00a314.99, Decathlon\n\nThis one-piece tankini swimsuit from Decathlon\u2019s swim brand Nabaiji is a good, flattering choice if you want extra coverage while being active at the beach. The way the tankini fabric sits over the main suit wouldn\u2019t win you any swim races, but it definitely makes you feel less exposed, as do the cycling short-style bottoms. The inner costume felt supportive on the chest, and it comes with removable pads. This goes up to a size 22.\n\nBuy now\n\nFinisterre vivet bikini top and shorts: \u00a355 top, \u00a345 shorts, Finisterre\n\nWe loved wearing this vivet bikini from Cornish eco brand Finisterre. We liked the print and flattering style, and felt confident sea swimming and playing beach tennis in it, thanks to the supportive cross-back design of the top and the comfortable, high coverage shorts. Both pieces held in place well thanks to fixed elastic banding. The bikinis are made using sustainable ECONYL fabric weaved in Italy and made in Portugal. The top features light moulded cups.\n\nBuy top now\n\nBuy shorts now\n\nSeafolly active swimsuit: \u00a372, Selfridges\n\nThis gorgeous Eighties-style swimsuit from Seafolly looked really nice on, though in spite of the name it didn\u2019t feel like a swimsuit we could be especially active in. Partly as it felt you might risk exposing yourself if you moved around too energetically in it, but also because there was little support on the chest. But we did love the style of the cut and it would be fine for holiday swimming and a gentle game of beach tennis.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Active swimsuits and bikinis\n\nWe love Deakin and Blue for its sustainable ethos and for the quality, comfort and support of its swimsuit. The best performing active bikinis were those from Speedo, Roxy and Finisterre.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
