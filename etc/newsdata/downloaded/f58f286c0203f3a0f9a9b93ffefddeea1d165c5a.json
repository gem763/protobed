Public Health England describes e-cigarettes as \u201cat least 95% less harmful\u201d than tobacco cigarettes. Dr. David Abrams, a professor at New York University, said that he thinks that\u2019s a fair estimate. \u201cActually, I would go further,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s no evidence from looking at the cancer biomarkers, that it could be as high as 98% or 99% for cancer.\u201d\n\nVaping isn\u2019t harmless, Abrams notes, as nicotine is still addictive and has its own health-related concerns. Eliminating the tar and carbon monoxide of smoking, however, makes for a dramatic difference in health issues between the two. What\u2019s more, the push to ban vaping will make it much more difficult to move current cigarette smokers to a much less harmful transition product. Abrams estimates that a ten year push to get cigarette smokers to e-cigs could save six to seven million lives a year.\n\nJust how much less harmful e-cigs are is the core of the debate, however. CBS This Morning addressed the controversy in a second video report, as American researchers studying long-term vaping impacts think it might be nearly as bad \u2014 at least outside the lungs. Current animal-based research shows tendencies toward arterial changes that could lead to significant heart disease with decades of use, which will lead to excess preventable deaths as well:\n\nBut other American scientists, like West Virginia University School of Medicine associate professor Mark Olfert, are drawing very different conclusions. \u201cI would say it\u2019s 95% harmful,\u201d Olfert said, \u201cbecause \u2026 in any single study that I\u2019ve seen that\u2019s looking at this in a meaningful way outside the lung, they\u2019re finding damage and harm.\u201d \u2026 In a recent study, Olfert looked at eight months of exposure \u2014 the equivalent of 25 human years. What he found concerns him: The animals\u2019 arteries stiffened almost as much as those exposed to cigarette smoke over the same time. \u201cStiffer arteries means greater risk for stroke, for heart attack, atherosclerosis, aneurisms, any number of vascular effects,\u201d Olfert said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely alarming, because it tells me that e-cigarettes simply are not gonna be safer than cigarettes.\u201d\n\nTo some extent, the two camps seem to be talking past each other. Abrams and the British science establishment isn\u2019t declaring vaping to be completely harmless and acknowledge that long-term risks have not yet been established. However, given the choice between the health impacts of cigarettes and e-cigs \u2014 which is the real and rational choice for current smokers \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t choose to shed the lung-related health impacts? The outcomes Olfert highlight are present at the same levels or worse for cigarettes too, which remain on the market.\n\nIt\u2019s the rash of acute illnesses and deaths that are driving concerns, which Abrams says is legitimate \u2014 but largely misdirected. The media coverage is driving a social panic about legitimate vaping when the deaths and injuries are related to home-brew vaping:\n\n\u201cI think all the evidence we\u2019ve seen from the FDA and the CDC reports is that these cases are people who bought marijuana oils on the street made either illegally or in a sort of a street version like a dirty street drug,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a single case that a commercially made legitimate e-cigarette that smokers are using has caused any of these illnesses,\u201d Abrams added. \u201cAnd I would say for smokers they should not be scared by what they\u2019re seeing and that e-cigarettes should still be used instead of cigarettes if they\u2019ve already switched.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also being driven by the nature of the vaping industry, which largely consists of the same tobacco companies that spent decades being, ahem, less than honest about health impacts. They spent a long, long time micturating on our heads and calling it precipitation, and not only on health impacts but also youth marketing. That\u2019s one of the concerns from US researchers \u2014 that vaping has been marketed not just to current smokers but also teens and young adults as a harmless experience. More recent restrictions have at least forced some changes to that approach, but it\u2019s hard to criticize scientists for approaching the next generation of nicotine delivery devices with a very large amount of skepticism.\n\nStill, that skepticism shouldn\u2019t outweigh the science, especially if it can help wean smokers off cigarettes. Right now, it seems as though we\u2019re poised to make the perfect the enemy of the good-enough-for-right-now.\n\nAddendum: Kudos to CBS News for a very fair and balanced approach to this controversy, too. It\u2019s not easy for news magazine shows to spend this much time and effort presenting all sides of an issue.", "description": "Skepticism.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cbs-vaping.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
