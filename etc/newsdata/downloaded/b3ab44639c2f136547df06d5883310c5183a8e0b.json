But despite some cancellations, it is again a top field.\"\n\nThe frustrations of tournament organisers in Vienna have been amplified by the fact Nadal and Djokovic are using the time instead, not to rest or curse injuries, but to play an exhibition charity match in Kazakhstan instead.\n\n\"I do not think it's good that there are exhibitions ongoing during ATP events,\" Vienna Open chief Edwin Weindorfer said.\n\n\"Players are ATP members. There is an off-season after the ATP Finals and anybody can play during that time.\n\n\"There was approval from ATP CEO Chris Kermode because, per rules, during ATP tournaments, an exhibition match cannot be held. So we need to respect that.\"\n\n- TeamTalk Media", "description": "Former world No 1 Thomas Muller has blasted Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic for undermining tournaments like the Vienna Open.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8346/e58bc7bf0af84050add7ac0648b87212.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
