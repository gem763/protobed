Inchoate fear, dressed up with bogus statistics, has helped make it a cliche that Social Security is the \u201cthird rail of American politics\u201d \u2014 cut it, and you\u2019re dead.\n\nThat\u2019s undoubtedly why, as The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Richard Rubin says, House Democrats are preparing a plan to raise Social Security taxes and expand the federal government\u2019s biggest and arguably most successful program ever. (About a quarter of the federal budget is spent on it.) For years, the Democrats\u2019 role has been to stop Republicans from gutting or privatizing Social Security. Now they want to expand it, and that\u2019s a bad idea too, though nowhere near as bad as shrinking it.\n\nWhat? Why?\n\nRead: Social Security is a lifeline for many older Americans, but how will it be funded in the future?\n\nNot because the program has terrible fiscal problems that mean America can\u2019t afford to secure a decent life for retirees \u2014 that\u2019s a dumb Washington argument, stating a problem that\u2019s easily fixed. But because America has much higher economic priorities than adding more to the pot for its richest age tier \u2014 the retirees are alright, as The Who almost said, and their grandkids need more to get going in life.\n\nWhat retirement crisis?\n\nThe path to understanding the idea that retirees are in decent shape, bending conventional wisdom of both political parties, rests on a few numbers.\n\nThe first comes from the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund industry trade group whose studies on retirement planning are a tonic, if not an antidote entirely, for pessimism.\n\nThe average U.S. retiree born in the 1960s can count on Social Security to replace 66% of their income if they retire at 67, ICI says. Workers who earned incomes in the bottom fifth of the population get about 98% of their inflation-adjusted lifetime earnings replaced by Social Security. That falls to 39% for workers in the top fifth.\n\nUpper-income people, who have to replace more income, also have respectable amounts salted away, statistics from mutual fund giant Fidelity show. The average baby boomer with a Fidelity-managed 401(k) plan has $357,000 in it. And more than 340,000 Fidelity accounts, either 401(k) or IRA, have at least $1 million. (IRS data say 70% of older workers are in some form of such a plan, at Fidelity or elsewhere.)\n\nPlus, Fidelity adds, this is only in their own plans \u2014 at Fidelity. What their spouses may have, and what may be in plans at other managers (say, in a 401(k) from a prior job), is on top of that.\n\nDo these sound like people whose prospects are dire, or eroding? Let\u2019s not forget that more than half of retirees don\u2019t have a mortgage, according to AARP.\n\nWarren\u2019s wealth redistribution\n\nOne could be forgiven, early in this campaign, for thinking Democrats believe money to solve social woes is infinite. The House Social Security plan calls for raising the payroll tax to 7.4% from 6.2% over 25 years, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign is saying she would raise taxes on the rich to boost Social Security payments by $200 a month and make the program even more progressive. Separately, she would also pass a yearly wealth tax on people with $50 million or more in assets and raise top marginal income-tax rates, to pay for other proposals.\n\nNow assume your high school teacher was right about economics being the science of allocating finite resources. Is more money for retirees how you\u2019d go?\n\nI\u2019d look more at the $1.5 trillion pile of student debt, doubled since 2009. That\u2019s the one meaningful financial bubble building up in this expansion.\n\nWhile student loans are less crippling than many assert, they\u2019re financial cholesterol clogging prospects for millions of households just starting out. And the rising cost of college itself \u2014 which Pell grants to working-class families have utterly failed to keep up with, making schools select richer, often-lazier kids who don\u2019t need aid \u2014 must be addressed.\n\nBoth complicate life for millions selling homes, cars and furniture to emerging families.\n\nHigher priorities\n\nThe next president\u2019s economic agenda should also focus on immigration, child care, health care and energy. Immigration, because the economy\u2019s (and Social Security\u2019s) biggest secular problem is a shortage of younger workers as boomers age. Child care because, as Warren has argued, it\u2019s a giant financial barrier to young families that constrains fundamental choices like how many kids to have.\n\nEnergy, because climate change threatens trillions of dollars of assets. It\u2019s not encouraging that Warren\u2019s big idea last week was banning fracking for natural gas \u2014 a technology that\u2019s eliminating usage of coal, by far Earth\u2019s most pernicious fossil fuel. Along the way, fracking\u2019s reducing Saudi Arabia and Iran to strategic irrelevance and creating millions of U.S. jobs. But, details.\n\nSocial Security\u2019s fine \u2014 like Medicare, an ongoing testament to government\u2019s ability to do a clearly defined job well. The better path now is to get education, energy and immigration economics even half as right.\n\nTim Mullaney is a MarketWatch columnist.", "description": "There is no retirement crisis, and America has higher priorities, says Tim Mullaney.", "authors": ["Tim Mullaney"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HI838_elizab_ZG_20190503121750.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
