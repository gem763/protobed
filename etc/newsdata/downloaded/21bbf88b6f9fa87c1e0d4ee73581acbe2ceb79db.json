(Alexander Ryumin, TASS News Agency Pool Photo via AP)\n\nPutin met with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al Sisi before the two leaders opened an economic meeting with heads of state, top officials and businessmen. The two-day summit is attended by leaders of 43 of the continent\u2019s 54 countries, with the other nations represented by senior officials.\n\nPutin said Russia\u2019s annual trade with African nations doubled in the last five years to exceed $20 billion. He noted that \u201cit\u2019s clearly not enough,\u201d adding that Russia\u2019s trade with Egypt accounts for about 40%.\n\nAl Sisi in his speech encouraged Russian companies to expand their investment in Africa. \u201cThere is an opportune moment for that now,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia has worked methodically in recent years to expand its influence in Africa, taking advantage of the seemingly waning U.S. interest in the continent under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Moscow has sought to revive relationships forged during the Cold War, when it poured funds and weapons into Africa in rivalry with the U.S., and has worked to cultivate new ties such as relations with South Africa.\n\nPutin noted that Moscow has written off $20 billion in debt \u2014 he did not say over what period \u2014 and provided aid to African nations. He said Russia is willing to expand trade, help tap natural resources and offer its technologies to the continent.\n\n\u201cThere are many potential partners in Africa with good perspectives and an enormous potential for growth,\u201d the Russian president said. \u201cIn the next four to five years we could again double our trade as a minimum.\u201d\n\nHe welcomed the recent creation of an African free trade zone, voicing hope that it will help further boost trade between Russia and the continent.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on the sidelines of the summit, Putin said Moscow is looking to expand trade with South Africa. That trade with one of Africa\u2019s most developed economies reached $1 billion last year.", "description": "Russia has worked to expand its influence in Africa, taking advantage of the seemingly waning U.S. interest in the continent under the Trump administration.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT828_putin__ZG_20191023074958.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
