It has honestly broken my heart.'\n\nHare, of Pontprennau, Cardiff, pleaded guilty to fraud after a Caerphilly trading standards investigation.\n\nEd Mitchard, defending, said: 'The best mitigation is his guilty plea. He accepts that the work he carried out was over and above his technical abilities.'\n\nJudge Tracey Lloyd-Clarke told Hare: 'Both the defendant and his son suffer from significant medical difficulties.\n\n'The work you carried out wasn't even to the standard of a DIY enthusiast and it was dangerous.\n\n'You milked your victim for virtually every penny he had.'\n\nHare was jailed for three years and nine months.\n\nSpeaking after the case, Caerphilly trading standards said: 'This is one of the worst cases we have come across and the sentence reflects the harm his actions caused to the victim and his family.\n\n'Sadly, this is not an isolated incident as vulnerable consumers are targeted.'", "description": "Jordan Hare, 31, from Pontprennau, Cardiff, targeted a Parkinson's sufferer in his 60s who was looking to modify his new home in Risca, near Newport, Souh Wales.", "authors": ["Emily Webber For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/18/19930512-0-image-a-2_1571504647228.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
