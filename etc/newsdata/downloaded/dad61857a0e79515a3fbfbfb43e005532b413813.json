But have the two of you sat down to review the plans together and see if the combined investments make sense as a whole? Chances are, you haven\u2019t. But financial experts think it\u2019s really important to do so.\n\n\u201cMarried investors can increase growth by having a united investment strategy that picks the best options from all available 401(k) accounts in order to build a superior combined strategy,\u201d said Patrick Whalen, a Certified Financial Planner at Whalen Financial Planning in Los Angeles.\n\nHere\u2019s how:\n\nThink of yourselves as an economic unit. \u201cMarried couples, and even committed, unmarried partners, are financially intertwined\u201d said Amy Barnes, CEO of Firebrand Wealth Management in Seattle. \u201cNo matter how separate they may keep their assets, savings strategies and investments, each of their financial lives, with rare exception, impacts the other.\u201d\n\nLiz Gillette, a Certified Financial Planner at MainStreet Financial Planning in Washington, D.C., suggested \u201cmentally consolidating the accounts.\u201d To do so, she said, \u201clook at fees and expense ratios for both plans (an expense ratio is what a mutual fund charges), look at investment options and identify their performance.\u201d Ultimately, Gillette notes, a couple needs to \u201ccome up with a joint investment allocation that suits you both.\u201d\n\nAlso read: How retirees should plan for an imminent recession\n\nReally study your retirement plan offerings together. \u201cEvery 401(k) plan is different, offering different investment options,\u201d noted Barnes. \u201cCouples can explore where they can lower costs among the investment products \u2014 such as looking at index funds instead of active mutual funds. And they can share their asset allocation with each other (how much money is in stocks versus bonds or other asset classes) to make sure they are growing their money sufficiently.\u201d\n\nGrab the best mutual fund offerings from both your 401(k) plans. \u201cThe quality of mutual funds varies widely between 401(k) plans, and it is often necessary to cherry-pick in order to create an overall strategy that isn\u2019t dragged down by mediocre funds,\u201d said Whalen. \u201cMy first step for screening mutual funds is to look for the funds with the lowest expense ratios.\u201d Whalen recommends looking for an expense ratio below 0.25%.\n\nBut what if one person in the couple has a 401(k) lacking a quality option in a major asset class, like international stocks? \u201cThat person should leave that asset class out of their plan, while the other person should overweight that asset,\u201d said Gordon Achtermann, of Your Best Path Financial Planning in Fairfax, Va.\n\nBe sure at least one of your 401(k)s includes a quality, low-cost bond fund. This will add diversification and help act as a buffer when the stock market heads south.\n\nAlso read: Why target-date funds are the best retirement investment\n\n\u201cIt is common for 401(k) plans to be missing good options for bonds. If only one spouse has access to quality, low-cost bond funds, then you can increase the allocation to bonds for the spouse with good options and reduce the bond allocation for the spouse with bad options,\u201d Whalen said.\n\nConsider making use of a Roth 401(k) if you can. That\u2019s a 401(k) funded with after-tax dollars; contributions in conventional 401(k)s are made with pretax dollars. With a Roth 401(k), your withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.\n\n\u201cOne spouse might have access to a Roth 401(k) plan, while the other may not,\u201d Whalen said. \u201cIn order to be more diversified from a tax perspective, it can be advantageous for the spouse with access to a Roth 401(k) plan to contribute to it.\u201d\n\nBoth of you should invest enough to get the company match, if you can afford to do that. That\u2019s, in essence, free money that can bolster your retirement savings. \u201cBoth people in the couple need to be contributing enough to get the largest company match their employer offers,\u201d said Achtermann.\n\nSee: Two-income couples are surprisingly unprepared for retirement \u2014 here\u2019s one reason why\n\nName each other a beneficiary for the other person\u2019s retirement plan, if you haven\u2019t already. That way you\u2019ll not only ensure that the funds will go to your loved one if you predecease him or her, it\u2019ll help you both think of your 401(k)s as linked.", "description": "Married investors can increase growth by having a united investment strategy, an expert says.", "authors": ["Lucy Lazarony"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ687_na_cou_ZG_20190904141048.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
