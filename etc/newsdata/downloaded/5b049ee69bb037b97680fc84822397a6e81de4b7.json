Microsoft wasn\u2019t left out of this group maliciously, many likely just assumed that its days of outsized growth were behind the firm that was founded in the mid-1970s.\n\nThis, however, is hardly that case, and Microsoft stock appears to be one of safest mega-cap tech buys out there at the moment, even at its new all-time highs.\n\nRecent News\n\nMicrosoft announced late Wednesday that it raised its quarterly cash dividend and approved a new stock buyback program. The company lifted its dividend to $0.51 per share, which marked an 11% increase from its last quarterly payout of $0.46. This is nothing earth-shattering because Microsoft has raised its quarterly payout every year since it started paying a dividend back in 2004. But it does remind investors once again of the historic tech firm\u2019s strength and stability.\n\nThe new payout, which will be payable on December 12 to shareholders of record on November 21, marks a slightly larger increase than last year\u2019s 9.5% boost from $0.42 to $0.46. Meanwhile, MSFT\u2019s board approved a new stock buyback program of up to $40 billion.\n\nInvestors should note that this is the third time it has approved a repurchase plan of this scope. Overall, the firm said it bought back approximately $35.7 billion worth of stock between fiscal 2017 and 2019.\n\nMSFT\u2019s Strength\n\nAs we touched on at the top, shares of Microsoft have surpassed off al the so-called FAANG stocks over the last 12 months, which includes Facebook FB, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Netflix NFLX, and Google GOOGL. In fact, second-place FB stock is up just 14% compared to MSFT\u2019s 24%. The company\u2019s stock price has now even outpaced AMZN over the last three years and blows away Apple (chart above).\n\nThe Redmond, Washington-based firm has inspired investor confidence through buybacks and dividends, which it has been able to achieve through its growing cash position. The company closed Q4 fiscal 2019 (its most recent quarter) with over $52 billion in net cash from operations. Yet perhaps what has been even more attractive to Wall Street is MSFT\u2019s expansion.\n\nMSFT\u2019s fourth quarter revenue popped 12%, with full-year sales up an impressive 14% for the second year in a row. More specifically, Intelligent Cloud sales jumped 21% in fiscal 2019 to account for 31% of total revenue. MSFT has seriously expanded its cloud computing business in recent years to cement itself as industry-leader Amazon\u2019s biggest challenger.\n\nThe company has landed major clients such as Walmart WMT. And it could attract more and more firms that have no intention of helping Jeff Bezos\u2019 e-commerce giant that wants to further expand its reach in everything from pharmaceuticals to logistics.", "description": "Microsoft (MSFT) stock appears to be one of safest mega-cap tech buys out there at the moment, even at its new all-time highs.
