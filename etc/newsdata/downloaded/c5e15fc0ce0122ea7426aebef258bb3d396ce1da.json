Some have zapped WeChat out of their phones. Others have abandoned e-wallets developed by Chinese conglomerates like Alibaba and Tencent. They disable location tracking on their smartphones.\n\nProtesters resist visual surveillance and facial recognition by using formations of open umbrellas aimed at cameras and helicopters. In August, some sawed down 20 \u201csmart\u201d lampposts in the city that they believed contained hardware for surveillance technology.\n\nHongkongers who do need to cross the border into Shenzhen for work use burner phones, though many have simply stopped entering mainland China. As protests take place in various districts in the city every few days, anonymity has become a matter of paramount importance.\n\nAdopting some elements of black bloc tactics, the city\u2019s blackshirt protesters dress identically\u2014black shirt, black pants, black shoes, gas mask, hard hat. Some clutch umbrellas. Many have saline solution to rinse out eyes when tear gas or pepper spray hits. A rare few have power packs and functioning display screens on their backs. Uniform dress is meant to inspire kinship, but more importantly to make it difficult to identify individuals who participate in street clashes or acts of destruction.\n\nOn Friday, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam invoked a colonial-era law to give herself emergency powers. Her first edict was to ban face masks, which protesters use to obscure their faces as well as prevent inhalation of tear gas fired by police\u2014now a weekly occurrence across the city. Obscuring one\u2019s face in public will carry a jail term of one year and a fine of HKD 25,000 ($3,190).\n\nAt a press conference, Lam claimed she was not, in fact, declaring a state of emergency. She said, \u201cWe must prevent Hong Kong and prevent students from taking things into their own hands, and recover Hong Kong\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nYounger protesters hit the streets every weekend precisely because they have their eyes on the future. If things progress as they have been, with the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s influence seeping into every facet of the city gradually, over years, Hongkongers believe their freedoms\u2014of assembly, of speech, of expression, of the press, and more\u2014will be stripped away.\n\nLam\u2019s ban on face masks will apply to all public gatherings. A pro-establishment lawmaker, Michael Tien, who refused to endorse Lam\u2019s move, said, \u201cNow it\u2019s all stick and no carrot.\u201d Tien had been urging Lam\u2019s administration to offer some concessions to Hongkongers, first by launching an inquiry into the police\u2019s use of force.\n\nAnother lawmaker, Tanya Chan, who leads the pan-democratic bloc, said the mask ban is an excuse for Lam to invoke other emergency powers. These include authorizing arrests, shutting down telecommunications, censoring media, seizing property, and changing or enacting laws if the city falls into an emergency state.\n\nBeyond the mask ban, pro-Beijing legislators in the city have toyed with the idea of pushing for a curfew.\n\nPresciently, in 2016, Edward Leung, a jailed activist whose slogan \u201cliberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time\u201d has become a rallying cry for Hongkongers in the past four months, pointed out that shortly after Ukraine passed legislation banning masks in 2014, the Euromaidan Revolution broke out.\n\nAs word spread that Lam\u2019s law will go into effect at midnight, thousands of people left work during lunch time in the central business district\u2014not far from the government headquarters\u2014to clog the streets. They chanted, \u201cHongkongers, resist!\u201d A few had gas masks with them, but most wore simple surgical masks\u2014in black, to match the color adopted by the protesters who face off with riot police every weekend. Buses, trucks, and cars blocked roads. By nightfall, when subway staff attempted to shutter a station\u2019s exit, protesters\u2014younger ones in gas masks and hard hats\u2014pushed the roller gate back up and smashed its controls.\n\nBy nightfall, students still in their school uniforms had formed human chains to pass supplies to hundreds of frontline protesters who had congregated near government buildings. Crowds continued to gather in neighborhoods across the city, with activists and frontline protesters and Hongkongers still in their attire from a day at the office jamming roads together.\n\nBranches of banks from mainland China were set on fire. Some businesses owned by pro-Beijing tycoons were ransacked, though no looting took place. The city\u2019s subway system was shut down completely\u2014the first time since protests broke out in June. At least three stations were flooded, while some others had their exits swallowed by flames.\n\nIf Lam thought a ban on masks would make people stay home, then she severely miscalculated. The day\u2019s escalation and damage were spontaneous and loaded with fury, beginning with office workers amassing in the afternoon, with people from all walks of life joining in throughout the day.\n\nA little past 11 p.m., one person boosted an excavator and drove it toward a police station, operating it based on an instruction manual that was downloaded from the internet. On live television, in several neighborhoods, some protesters read aloud a prepared statement that declares the establishment of a provisional government for Hong Kong, quoting the Declaration of Independence.\n\nAs Carrie Lam promised, the law kicked in at midnight despite a frantic judicial review aimed at temporarily suspending the ban on masks. By then, most protesters had dispersed.\n\nThe uprising in Hong Kong has shifted from anger directed at local officials like Lam to a broader insurrection against the Chinese Communist Party. On Oct. 1, when the People\u2019s Republic of China turned 70, a large portrait of Chinese president Xi Jinping was egged for an afternoon by Hongkongers. Captions on printouts of his face read \u201cdemon\u201d or \u201cdevil.\u201d A black banner hung on a footbridge read that Hong Kong stands in solidarity with Tibet and Xinjiang, where an estimated 1.5 million Uyghurs are held in concentration camps. Hongkongers look at the CCP and say it is an organization of \u201cChinazis.\u201d Graffiti here and there read, in Cantonese, \u201cCongratu-fucking-lations\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating the last National Day.\u201d\n\nIt is the 118th consecutive day of protests in Hong Kong. People have adopted dark humor as they make sense of a new reality for the city. Some said Halloween starts tomorrow. Others joked that everyone now has the flu. (In Hong Kong, as well as some other locations in East Asia, it is common for those with flu-like symptoms to don surgical masks in public.)\n\nSpeaking in Beijing, the spokesman for the State Council\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Yang Guang, said the \u201cchaotic situation in Hong Kong cannot continue indefinitely.\u201d Yang also insisted that the blackshirt movement is the consequence of foreign powers intervening in Hong Kong\u2014a consistent point of disinformation pushed by the CCP.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already \u2018rioters,\u2019\u201d one frontline protester told me Friday, invoking a word that Carrie Lam, the police, Hong Kong\u2019s pro-Beijing officials, and the CCP use to describe those who hit the streets. \u201cThat\u2019s 10 years in prison. What\u2019s another year for wearing our gas masks?\u201d", "description": "Demonstrators, who take pains to make sure they can\u2019t be identified, defied the edict in the hours after it was announced.", "authors": ["Brendon Hong"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2304,w_4096,x_0,y_337/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570211731/GettyImages-1173635937_pmdwx8", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
