If you see a video of a pool ball knocking into another one, for instance, and then reverse that same video, the physical processes would both make sense and it would be impossible at the level of physics to know which way around would be correct.\n\nBut the universe does have one rule that goes only in one way: the second law of thermodynamics, which describes the progression from order to disorder.\n\nIf you saw a video of someone breaking a perfectly arranged triangle of pool balls into a mess, for instance, then watching that backwards would obviously look nonsensical.\n\nThe new experiment is like giving the pool table such a perfectly calculated kick that the balls rolled back into an orderly pyramid.\n\nThe scientists found that, working with just two qubits, \u201ctime reversal\u201d was achieved with a success rate of 85 per cent. When three qubits were involved more errors occurred, resulting in a 50 per cent success rate.\n\nThe error rate is expected to drop as scientists improve the sophistication of the devices used, the researchers behind the discovery said.\n\nThe experiment could have a practical application in the development of quantum computers, the scientists said.\n\n\u201cOur algorithm could be updated and used to test programs written for quantum computers and eliminate noise and errors,\u201d said Dr Lesovik.", "description": "Scientists have reversed the direction of time with a quantum computer.
