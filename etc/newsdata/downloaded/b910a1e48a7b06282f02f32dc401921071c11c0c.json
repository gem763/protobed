The U.S. did, however, fail to deter the incursion, and it failed to broker any kind of deal between Turkey and the YPG, the armed Kurdish militia fighting the Islamic State in northern Syria.\n\nAll of that is now history, and \u2014 as we know \u2014 there are no do-overs in history. All the U.S. can do today is focus on continuing to protect its interests in the region for tomorrow.\n\nAmerica has always had limited capabilities, interests and influence in Syria, and Syria\u2019s fate has never been a vital U.S. interest.\n\nSyrian leader Bashar Assad, the country\u2019s weak strongman, has always been in the orbit of Iran and Russia. If it weren\u2019t for the outbreak of the civil war there \u2014 resulting in horrific atrocities by his regime, a flood of refugees and the rise of an ISIS \"caliphate\" bent on transnational terrorism \u2013 the U.S. couldn\u2019t care less.\n\nYet because of the chaos arising from Turkey\u2019s actions, the U.S. now has good reasons to be serious about Syria. We don\u2019t want to see another caliphate. We don\u2019t want Iran to have a platform to attack Israel. We don\u2019t want to see waves of refugees destabilizing the region and overflowing into Europe.\n\nThe Turkish incursion has forced the U.S. to reduce its footprint in Syria or risk putting our small contingent there at risk of being caught in a shooting war between the YPG and Turkish forces. Indeed, over the weekend there were reports that Turkish indirect fire came dangerously close to a U.S. forward position.\n\nWe also saw a rash of dire predictions that the Turkish incursion and the U.S. pullback would reverse all that we\u2019ve achieved in Syria and put us back to President Barack Obama's \"square one\" or worse.\n\nWe\u2019ll see. It\u2019s just too soon to tell.\n\nBut there\u2019s no doubt that what\u2019s happening there now is bad. For the civilians caught in the middle, it\u2019s tragic. Fighters on both sides are dying over territory they should be negotiating over. And the prospects of reaching an end to Syria\u2019s civil war have been pushed farther into the distance.\n\nBut core U.S. interests have not necessarily have not yet been put in jeopardy \u2014 and they won\u2019t be as long the problems in Syria can be kept in Syria. The Turkish intervention won\u2019t undermine U.S. efforts to pressure Iran into more civilized behavior. And it won\u2019t jeopardize U.S. relationships with other allies.\n\nWhile both ISIS and Assad may try to take advantage of the chaos, it\u2019s unlikely that the repositioning of the small contingent of U.S. troops will tip the balance in either one\u2019s favor.\n\nYet the Turks' distinctly undesirable action has created a public relations disaster for the Trump administration. As it tries to get on top of that, it must also continue to protect America\u2019s limited interests in Syria.\n\nFor starters, Washington \u2014 and the rest of the free world \u2014 must hold Turkey accountable for its actions. Germany and other European allies have rightly condemned Ankara\u2019s aggression.\n\nWe also must continue trying to broker a cease-fire. In the long term, fighting isn\u2019t in the interest of either side; it certainly doesn\u2019t make our efforts any easier, and it\u2019s just more misery for the people of Syria.\n\nThe U.S. will also need to bolster its presence and influence in the region. The recent deployment of U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia to help defend the kingdom against a repeat of Iranian aggression is a good step. U.S. troops will also need to continue to exert influence in Iraq, where protests and violence threaten the country\u2019s tenuous stability.\n\nAt home, the administration will have to ride out the massive wave of criticism.\n\nThe U.S. isn\u2019t fighting endless wars, nor does it have any desire to do so. We aren\u2019t going to end intractable conflicts in the region like Syria, Yemen and Libya \u2014 nor is that our job.\n\nThat said, we do want to see the region at peace. We don\u2019t want to see the likes of ISIS run amok. We don\u2019t want to see millions more refugees destabilizing nations near and far. For these reasons, the U.S. cannot just withdraw from the Middle East. If we did, all the worst excesses fermenting in the region would quickly follow us home.\n\nWe need to be persistent. We need to show resolve. We need sustainable presence and engagement. We need to work patiently for a better future for all in the Middle East.", "description": "The United States\u00a0did not greenlight\u00a0the Turkish incursion into Syria.
