This trend is not smooth and lends itself to fitting a straight edge, but it meets the simple definition of higher lows and higher highs.\n\nRight now Wendy's is back above the 50-day moving-average line and above the rising 200-day line. The 200-day line was successfully tested in early August before prices exploded higher into early September.\n\nWendy's is coming back from a gap to the downside, with the lows of last week a good place for a sell stop. The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is improving again and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is narrowing toward a potential bullish crossover.\n\nThe weekly bar chart of Wendy's below presents a mixed picture. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving-average line, and this chart does not have the price gap. The weekly OBV line shows a long decline into March of this year before the trend improves. The MACD oscillator on this time is still bullish.\n\nIn this first Point and Figure chart of WEN below, we see an upside price target of $23.22, which will be a new high for the move up on this chart.\n\nIn this second Point and Figure chart of WEN below, we used weekly data and we now can see a $32 price target.\n\nBottom line strategy: Risking a close below $19, traders can probe the long side of WEN. Our price targets are $23 and $32.", "description": "Here's a rare chance to buy into a restaurant chain that's investing heavily for the future....WEN", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Wendy'S Stock Looks As If Investors Will Be Placing Orders To Go Long", "Here'S A Rare Chance To Buy Into A Restaurant Chain That'S Investing Heavily For The Future.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa", "Alex Frew Mcmillan", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/7282a1f0-d3d1-11e9-822b-b782162f9ed0.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
