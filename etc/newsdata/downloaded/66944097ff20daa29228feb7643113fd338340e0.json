They investigated themselves. That doesn't work.\n\n'Fox News had an outside investigator. CBS had an outside investigator. NPR, the NFL. This is how it's done. You get somebody on the outside.'\n\nBut last night an NBC spokeswoman said there would not further investigation.\n\nHilary Smith told the Hollywood Reporter: 'There is no additional investigation being launched. We are very confident in the report that was conducted.\n\n'We fired Matt Lauer within 24 hours of learning what he did, and promptly launched a corporate investigation.\n\nRonan Farrow's new book, Catch and Kill, claims NBC had known about Lauer's alleged sexual misconduct long before he was fired in November 2017\n\nKelly told Tucker Carlson NBC should launch an external probe, as Fox News and CBS did after their own sexual misconduct scandals\n\n'Based on our investigative findings, we have swiftly taken appropriate actions to address the situation and improve workplace culture.\n\n'It is also worth noting that this was a corporate investigation that was conducted by an almost entirely female team, none of whom are part of the news division.'\n\nMailOnline contacted NBC for a comment on calls for a fresh investigation by the network.\n\nKelly went on to tell Carlson that unless there was an external investigation the public would lose faith in the process.\n\nShe said: 'There's a question of the faith and confidence of the public and the reporting of NBC on matters involving itself. To me as a lawyer, it's just always better if you send it outside.\n\n'Then people can have more faith in it and if there's nothing to hide, you have no worries about it. You have nothing to worry about.'\n\nKelly also called for the Lauer accusers to be released from Non-Disclosure Agreements.\n\nShe added: 'I had been reporting on the story even while I was at NBC. I talked to Ronan. I talked to his producer Rich McHugh, I talked to Rose McGowan.\n\nIn 2013, an alleged settlement was made over Lauer with Today producer, Melissa Lonner (pictured that year) who told anchor Ann Curry in 2010 that Lauer had exposed himself and propositioned her\n\n'I talked to many Harvey Weinstein victims and accusers and was getting to the bottom of what NBC knew while I was there. And then just independently.\n\n'That's the situation where the receptionist is suddenly getting a seven-figure goodbye.\n\n'The number one thing that needs to happen now is they need to release any and all Matt Lauer accusers from their confidentiality agreements. NBC says it has nothing to hide. Great. Let's not hide anything,' said Kelly.\n\n'Show us all of the agreements, the enhanced severance agreements reached or at least the number so we can see which ones pop out and which ones are super high.\n\n'Are they all women? Do they all have a connection with Matt Lauer? Release the women from their confidentiality obligations.'\n\nShe added: 'The question is what did they know about Matt Lauer prior to the time the woman came forward who was ultimately his downfall?'\n\nEarlier in the day, former NBC News host Linda Vester made a similar proposal, saying: 'Comcast, the parent company, should launch a real investigation with outside investigations right away.'", "description": "Megyn Kelly called for her former employers NBC to launch and external probe into claims Matt Lauer raped a producer in 2014.
