(AP) - The Los Angeles Chargers couldn\u2019t hide their glaring shortcoming on Sunday, and the problem became even worse against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThe Chargers rushed for just 32 yards. In the entire game.\n\nPittsburgh stuffed the run en route to a 24-17 victory over the Chargers. The Chargers scored 17 fourth-quarter points to make things interesting, but the comeback bid was too little, too late.\n\nThe Chargers (2-4) were shut out in the first half of back-to-back home games for the first time since October 1975, some 44 years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not scoring,\u201d quarterback Philip Rivers said. \u201cTeams turn it over two times a game, and they win. Now, we can\u2019t be careless with the ball. But we have to score. If you have two turnovers and you score 28, you can win. We\u2019re not even talking about it. We\u2019re talking about Hunter. When you turn it over and you\u2019re not scoring and you get beat, you look for lots of things.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we\u2019ve got to find a way to get into the end zone. To me that\u2019s the biggest issue we\u2019re having offensively. Our job is to score one more point than the other team, and right now we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d\n\nRivers was under pressure all night. He completed 26-of-43 passes for 320 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. About the only thing that was working in the passing game, before the flurry in the fourth quarter, was when Rivers found tight end Hunter Henry, who played in his first game back from a knee injury.\n\nHenry caught eight passes for 100 yards and two touchdowns. He also caught a 19-yard pass on the Chargers\u2019 first play from scrimmage.\n\nThis was the Chargers first game without center Mike Pouncey, who is scheduled to have season-ending surgery this Friday.\n\n\u201cLosing Pounce is aways tough. He\u2019s an all-pro center,\u201d said Dan Feeney, who started at center for the Chargers on Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player in this league. We just need to put up a little bit more on our backs as an O-line. Take a little more off Phil and the receivers. We\u2019ve got to get this running game going.\u201d\n\nMelvin Gordon, in his second game of the season, was held to 18 yards on eight carries. Austin Ekeler had 14 yards on five carries. Ekeler had an 11-yard gain, for the longest run of the night. Last week, Ekeler had 15 catches - the most by a Chargers running back in 39 years - against the Broncos. This week, Gordon and Ekeler combined for just six receptions for 74 yards.\n\n\u201cThose guys are good in space, so we had to close down the distance,\u201d Steelers linebacker Devin Bush said. \u201cThere were a couple times there was a lot of distance between the defenders. Something we can clean up.\u201d\n\nEkeler came into Sunday leading the AFC in receptions and was third in scrimmage yards, averaging 116.6 yards per game. He had just 28 total yards from scrimmage on Sunday.\n\nGordon has just 49 yards on 20 carries in his two games since ending his contract holdout.\n\nThe offense had its struggles, but, the defense and special teams were equally bad.\n\nThe Chargers defense wasn\u2019t without fault. In the second quarter, James Conner caught a short pass from quarterback Devlin Hodges - making his first start for the injured Mason Rudolph - and linebacker Jatavis Brown appeared to have Conner wrapped up near the sideline. He whiffed, and Conner ran the rest of the way to the end zone untouched for a 26-yard touchdown reception and 21-0 lead. The lead grew to 24-0 early in the third quarter.\n\nWith 32 seconds left before halftime, Chase McLaughin missed a 43-yard field goal that hit the left goal post. It was just that kind of day for the Chargers.\n\nThe Steelers had the ball for the first drive of the second half and the Chargers had four defensive penalties to help them extend that drive. To come out of halftime with those kinds of mistakes was baffling. Two were 15-yard penalties. The Steelers got a field goal out of that drive.\n\nThe Chargers overcame that rough second-half start to score 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter, but it was not enough. And so much of the problem is not being able to establish the run game.\n\n\u201cThe run game is tough right now,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cAustin and I can\u2019t get things rolling. Right now, the passing game looks like it\u2019s working, so we\u2019re going to have to use the pass to open up the run. In some games, the run opens up the pass, but how it\u2019s looking right now, the pass is going to have to open up the run.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Los Angeles Chargers couldn't hide their glaring shortcoming on Sunday, and the problem became even worse against the Pittsburgh Steelers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jill Painter Lopez"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/aptopix_steelers_chargers_football_49046_c0-186-4459-2787_s1200x700.jpg?a969b4df46a73d565968546ea9b29e6776a631ff", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
