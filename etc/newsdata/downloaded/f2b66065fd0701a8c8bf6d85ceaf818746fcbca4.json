Milne said he believes the thieves used at least two vehicles to make off with the golden score.\n\nMISSISSIPPI MAN IN CAPTAIN AMERICA COSTUME NABBED DURING EARLY MORNING BURGLARY ATTEMPT: COPS\n\n\"The artwork has not been recovered at this time but we are conducting a thorough investigation to find it and bring those responsible to justice,\" Milne said.\n\nThe golden john actually performs its necessary bathroom functions and was part of an exhibit by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan titled \"Victory is Not an Option\" that opened at Blenheim Palace last Thursday. It had been built in a wood chamber opposite the room in which Churchill was born.\n\nThose visiting Blenheim Palace were normally given three minutes alone with the toilet to take it on a test drive. Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones had described the experience of using the lavatory as \"peeing on porcelain.\"\n\nThe toilet was on display at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2016 and was scheduled to be open to the public at Blenheim during a seven-week exhibition from Sept. 12 to Oct. 27.\n\nBefore the toilet was installed, Edward Spencer-Churchill, the founder of the Blenheim Art Foundation, was confident it wouldn't be easily stolen.\n\n\u201cFirstly, it\u2019s plumbed in and secondly, a potential thief will have no idea who last used the toilet or what they ate,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cSo no, I don\u2019t plan to be guarding it.\u201d\n\nMOM ALLEGEDLY FED FAST FOOD TO OBESE TEEN DYING IN HOSPITAL: REPORT\n\nBlenheim Palace announced they would be shut down for the rest of Saturday, but it will reportedly be \"business as usual\" on Sunday. The palace is the main residence of the Dukes of Marlborough and was built in the early 1700s.\n\n\"We are saddened by this extraordinary event, but also relieved no one was hurt,\" Blenheim Palace announced on Twitter following the theft. \"We are very grateful to our staff and to Thames Valley Police for their rapid and brave reactions. We knew there was huge interest in the Maurizio Cattelan contemporary art exhibition, with many set to come and enjoy the installations.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnyone with more information is urged to contact the Thames Valley Police.", "description": "Police are on the hunt for a solid gold working toilet valued at over $1 million that was stolen\u00a0overnight on Saturday at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, England,\u00a0causing damage and flooding at the birthplace and ancestral home of Winston Churchill.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Blenheim-Palace-toilet-Getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
