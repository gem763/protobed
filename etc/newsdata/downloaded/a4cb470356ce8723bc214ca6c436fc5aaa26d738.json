But she stopped short of issuing an apology.\n\nThough James Cook's exploration of New Zealand dominates history books, Dutch navigator Abel Tasman was the first European to catch sight of it, in 1642.\n\nMaori people from Polynesian islands are believed to have arrived in New Zealand hundreds of years prior to the first Europeans.\n\nWhat celebrations are planned?\n\nNew Zealand has planned several days of events to mark the milestone of the first meeting between Maori and Europeans.\n\nOn Tuesday, a flotilla of ships including a replica of the Endeavour will reach Gisborne, a city on the east coast of North Island.\n\nAlong with the crowds and officials, hundreds of protesters are expected to be present. As the flotilla has travelled around the coast, some Maori tribes have refused to let it come to their shores.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Endeavour, the ship used by Captain James Cook during his great voyage of exploration of 1768- 1771\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern will be present when the Endeavour docks in Poverty Bay.\n\nOn Saturday, as she kicked off commemoration events, Ms Ardern called for a more open conversation about New Zealand's history.\n\n\"We were only really telling, I believe, 50% of the story, and not always telling it well,\" she said.\n\nNew Zealand should continue to learn and tell the full story of its past, she added.\n\nWhy is the anniversary controversial?\n\nWhen James Cook arrived on the Turanganui River, what is now Gisborne, the first encounter between his crew and the Maori inhabitants was deadly.\n\nA leader of the Ngati Oneone group was immediately shot and killed after what is believed to be a misunderstanding over a ceremonial challenge. At least eight other Maori were killed.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tina Ngata says Maori people are still suffering under the legacy of colonialism\n\nDespite the statement of regret, many Maori rights advocates say not enough has been down to acknowledge what happened in those first few days of Cook's arrival.\n\n\"It's a commemoration or an anniversary of invasion and imperial expansion,\" said Tina Ngata, an indigenous rights advocate who has been leading the opposition to the commemoration events.\n\nProtesters also say their Maori ancestors were treated unfairly during the colonial era and that today, Maori communities face disproportionate levels of poverty, crime and discrimination as a result.\n\nIn Gisborne, a statue of Cook has been repeatedly defaced with graffiti and is to be replaced.", "description": "Indigenous rights advocates say government money should not be spent to celebrate \"an invasion\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9648/production/_109127483_gettyimages-1179033126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
