It was a massive slap in the face to Democrats who are desperate to impeach President Trump. The documents provided a rather underwhelming reaction concerning the allegations lobbed against the White House regarding this conversation, where Trump supposedly threatened to withhold military aid, or grant it, in accordance with some investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son and his dealings there; Hunter Biden was a key person in an energy company in Ukraine. Eight times Biden was reportedly referenced in the transcript, so said the media before the transcript was actually released. USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The Hill, CNBC, and others reported on this\u2014and low and behold everyone was wrong.\n\n-No quid pro quo\n\n-No talk of withholding military aid\n\n-Trump asked Ukraine to look into the firing of a prosecutor, who Biden bragged about firing under threat of withholding $1 billion in loan securities\n\n-Trump concern over Ukraine election interferencehttps://t.co/gUOxRLyCpS \u2014 Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) September 25, 2019\n\nBiden was referenced once\u2014and it was the Ukrainians who brought it up. And there was no quid pro quo. Folks, this is why anonymous sources aren\u2019t what they used to be. Long gone are the days of Deep Throat giving solid information. These sources now could be the bagel boy or the janitor for all we know. This was a second-hand account, where the so-called whistleblower didn\u2019t even listen in on the call. This is even a bigger nothing-burger than the Trump-Russia collusion myth. And it once again goes to the heart of the liberal media\u2019s hatred of Trump, their propensity to use trash sources to clip this White House, which then gives Democrats ammunition to mount destructive and false political campaigns that only divide the country more. The flip side is every time the media and the Democrats get torched for their anti-Trump hysteria, it\u2019s a massive in-kind contribution to Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign.\n\nThis is 100% wrong. The transcript of President Trump\u2019s call will be an actual transcript of exactly what was said. https://t.co/L3CRW62tVw \u2014 Matt Wolking (Text TRUMP to 88022) (@MattWolking) September 25, 2019\n\nHere's what we learned from the call transcript Democrats demanded be released:\n\n\n\n? Ukraine brought the Biden tie-in up first.\n\n\n\n?President Trump was concerned about 2016 election interference.\n\n\n\n? No quid pro quo about foreign aid. \u2014 Andrew Clark (@AndrewHClark) September 25, 2019\n\nSo, once again, we have a manufactured media myth that blew up in liberal America\u2019s face. It\u2019s annoying. But seeing the liberal media twist themselves into a pretzel over how this is bad news for Trump is grade-A entertainment. It\u2019s absolute hilarity. How many times have we been told Trump will be undone by x, y, or z? It hasn\u2019t happened. My feeling is that Trump knew the long game here. He knew it was nothing. He dragged it out because the media is biased, stupid, and corrupt\u2014and he knows how to work them. He can make them do anything. Also, Trump can say whatever he wants to a foreign leader and it\u2019s not the job of the intelligence community to snitch on the president to Congress over communications like this.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we have an impeachment push before anyone has actually read the transcript. Gross overreach all around, which has become a common occurrence for those on the Left.", "description": ".09/25/2019 19:23:53PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/ce732fbd-0cda-4321-9995-e0f3c3f68816.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
