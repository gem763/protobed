At the time, she and her son were living out of her van and homeless shelters, and spending nights at an apartment in Bridgeport, the Connecticut Post had reported.\n\nThe mother was arrested and charged with first-degree larceny and served five years behind bars for the \u201cstolen\u201d education.\n\n\u201cWho would have thought that wanting a good education for my son would put me in this predicament?\u201d McDowell, who also had prior drug charges, said in court at the time of her sentencing. \u201cI have no regrets seeking a better education for him, I do regret my participation in this drug case.\u201d\n\nRELATED: John Legend Reacts to Felicity Huffman\u2019s 14-Day Sentence: \u2018Prisons and Jails Are Not the Answer\u2019\n\nOn Friday, actress Huffman was sentenced to 14 days behind bars for her role in the college admissions scandal, which included paying $15,000 to admissions consultant William \u201cRick\u201d Singer and his nonprofit organization, Key Worldwide Foundation (\u201cKWF\u201d), who then facilitated cheating on Huffman\u2019s daughter\u2019s SAT test by having a proctor correct the teen\u2019s answers after the fact.\n\nJim Michaud/Getty Images More\n\nCritics pointed out the stark contrast in the consequences between these two cases, arguing that it exemplified a disparity that continues to put underprivileged communities at a disadvantage.\n\nSimilarly, in 2011, Ohio mom Kelley Williams-Bolar was sentenced to 10 days in county jail and was convicted of lying about her home address to get her daughters into a different school district. Williams-Bolar refused when officials asked her to pay $30,000 in back tuition, and she was convicted of falsifying residency records.\n\nEarlier this year, The Washington Post reported that a new study showed white school districts received $23 billion more in government funding than nonwhite school districts in 2016, regardless of the fact that they had the same number of students.\n\nRELATED: Felicity Huffman Sentenced to 14 Days Behind Bars in College Admissions Scam\n\nThus many parents, like McDowell and Williams-Bolar, find themselves using the addresses of friends and family to get their children into better school districts.\n\n\u201cWhile there is a part of us that may feel some sense of vindication at the idea of these parents serving five years in prison because Tanya McDowell served five years in prison when she was so much more deserving, that\u2019s not justice,\u201d Rebecca J. Kavanagh, a New York City public defender, told Refinery29 of the college admissions scandal verdicts. \u201cJustice is for Tanya McDowell to have never been charged, convicted or sentenced to prison and to have the same educational opportunity for her son as these parents have for their children.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Kim Kardashian Helped Free Alice Johnson, 64, from Prison \u2013 Then Hired Her to Model SKIMS Shapewear", "description": "Mom Sentenced to 5 Years for Using Friend's Address to Enroll Son in School", "authors": ["Claudia Harmata"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nNKk_HFYLyl3QZ12Dhy1Gg--~B/aD0xMzMxO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/837223794b13cf28b1e12b5870a55a89", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
