Plus, it requires drivers to pay attention and keep their hands on the steering wheel. In September, the company rolled out a feature called Smart Summon, which automatically fetches your car from the parking lot to the curb where you\u2019re standing, provided the car is in the line of your sight.\n\nWith Autopilot, Smart Summon, and a cabin-facing camera, Musk wants to eventually turn Teslas into robotaxis that can operate without human drivers.\n\nHe also warned users the full self-driving mode will not work in every location and every scenario. He added the feature-complete version of FSD, that might roll out by the end of the year, will require some driver attention.\n\nOn top of this, national and state regulations on autonomous vehicle operation will likely apply and determine whether this feature will be available to owners.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FTesla-Autopilot-interior.jpg&signature=4a629e3de8bf5c047bd2d5a8420e03ba", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
