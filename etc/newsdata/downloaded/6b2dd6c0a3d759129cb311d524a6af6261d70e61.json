It's not like we've all had the same dodgy curry.\n\n\"We got as leaflet through the door about a month ago saying the water could be discoloured while the work was going on, but it's been running clear.\n\n\"But I'm going to be getting some bottled water on the way home from work - you just can't take the chance.\"\n\nA spokesperson for United Utilities said water quality officers had taken samples from across the area and found nothing of concern.\n\n(Image: MEN WS)\n\nIn a statement the firm added: \u201cWe have been in the area carrying out mains cleaning.\n\n\"Mains cleaning is carried out to remove naturally occurring deposits which have built up over time.\n\n\"While carrying out the work, occasionally it can cause discolouration which is short-lived.\n\n\"We have no reason to believe the water supply is causing the illness reported.
