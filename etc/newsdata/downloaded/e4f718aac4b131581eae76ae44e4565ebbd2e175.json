ON HIS HANDS' AFTER EL PASO MASS SHOOTING\n\nO'Rourke made news last week when he said \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, and we\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against your fellow Americans anymore\" during the Democratic presidential debates in Houston, Texas.\n\nSome Democrats have criticized O'Rourke for his comments including Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who said last week on CNN that O'Rourke's comments were not a wise \"policy or political move.\"\n\n\u201cI frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns,\" Coons told CNN.\n\nNichols said he believes O'Rourke is handling the issue \"emotionally\" and it could hurt Democrats.\n\n\"I do think that he was emotionally affected just like many Americans have been emotionally affected by a lot of the mass shootings. I think you should look at the numbers and see what's going on and think this through a little more than he has,\" Nichols told Carlson.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"And I think... Chris Coons is right... we want to win states that we can win like Texas and Georgia and Florida and Pennsylvania. We can't talk about taking guns.\"\n\n", "description": "University of Maryland lecturer Dr. Jason Nichols says he disagrees\u00a0with Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke's newfound push to take away guns from Americans.", "authors": ["Victor Garcia"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/17/694940094001_6086894943001_6086898623001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
