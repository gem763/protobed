Some of the ads were for established brands including Samsung, Heinz, Grammarly, and Clinique.\n\nThe videos endorsed consuming substances like juice, turmeric, baking soda, and even donkey's milk as ways to prevent or even cure cancer.\n\nThe video the BBC found promoting donkey milk had over 446,000 views at time of writing.\n\nRead more: America's doctors warn Google, Twitter, and Facebook: Anti-vaxxers are weaponizing tech platforms, prompting outbreaks that can \"debilitate and kill\"\n\nThe BBC's research indicated that videos not in English were slipping through YouTube's net more than English-language ones.\n\nYouTube announced in a blog post in January that it would crack down on \"borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways.\" It described the enforcement as a \"gradual change\" that would only apply to videos from the US to begin with.\n\nOnce the BBC informed advertisers about their campaigns running alongside the videos, some distanced themselves. Kraft Heinz and Grammarly said they had taken steps to block the channels responsible.\n\nYouTube demonetized 70 of the videos after being contacted by the BBC, a spokesman told Business Insider.\n\nThe spokesman said: \"Misinformation is a difficult challenge, and we have taken a number of steps to address this including showing more authoritative content on medical issues, showing information panels with credible sources, and removing ads from videos that promote harmful health claims.\n\n\"Our systems are not perfect but currently, the majority of the searches about cancer cures are pointing users to authoritative sources. We're constantly making improvements, and we remain committed to progress in this space.\"\n\nThis is not the first time misleading \u2014 and in some cases actively harmful \u2014 videos about health have spread on YouTube.\n\nBusiness Insider's Tom Porter found a network of videos pushing an autism \"cure\" called Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS), which contains industrial bleach.", "description": "Fake cancer cures touted by the videos also included turmeric and baking soda.
