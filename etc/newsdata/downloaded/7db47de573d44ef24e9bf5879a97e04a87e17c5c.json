Pugh was a board member of UMMS until her resignation on March 18. Two other board members resigned a day earlier.\n\nAccording the Sun, the medical system paid Pugh $500,000 for copies of the Healthy Holly books, and the payments were made for a number of years. The Sun also reports:\n\n\"Under the deal with the medical system, UMMS paid Pugh $500,000 for copies of the books while she served on its board. UMMS paid $100,000 in each of five transactions in 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2018 to purchase 20,000 copies of her self-published books at $5 per book.\n\nAt a news conference last week, Pugh apologized for doing \"something to upset the people of Baltimore,\" saying she never intended to do \"anything that could not stand up to scrutiny.\"\n\nIn her statement announcing her leave, Pugh made no mention of the scandal.\n\nBaltimore's Charter states that Baltimore City Council President Bernard \"Jack\" Young will take over mayoral duties. The change in power goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement of his own, Young called the mayor's leave \"temporary\" and said he understands how \"traumatizing\" the saga has been for the people of Baltimore.\n\n\"I am utterly heartbroken by the developments that have unfolded over the past several weeks. I pray that Mayor Pugh continues to recover from her illness,\" Young said in the statement.\n\nHe also vowed to be a \"stabilizing force\" and promoted himself as someone who takes his \"responsibilities seriously.\"", "description": "Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh is embroiled in a political scandal involving hundreds of thousands of dollars for her self-published children's books.
