You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAn analysis of official statistics by the Local Government Association (LGA) shows the figure has risen from 127 in 2014 to 1,152 in 2018, with the rate of these child referrals increasing by 67 per cent in a year alone, from 690 in 2017, with children now accounting for 92 per cent of all referrals made by councils.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Crime Agency (NCA) revealed that 292 children were rescued from county lines drugs networks last week alone as part of a crackdown on the activity, and a record 743 people arrested.\n\nThe LGA, which represents councils in England, said the spiralling referral rates were being fuelled by an increasing awareness of modern slavery and the growing issue of young people being exploited by county lines drug gangs, which it said was putting its services under increasing and significant pressure.\n\nCampaigners are calling for a scheme of \u201cindependent legal guardians\u201d, which already exists in Northern Ireland and Scotland, and allocates each child an advocate who would be able to instruct solicitors on their behalf and represent their interests.\n\nLaura Duran, senior policy and research officer at Ecpat (Every Child Protected Against Trafficking) UK, said the increase in referrals was \u201chugely concerning\u201d because local authorities \u201csimply do not have the funding to adequately safeguard an ever-increasing number of children needing specialist support\u201d.\n\n\u201cThrough our direct work with trafficked young people, we see firsthand the risks they face if they aren\u2019t adequately supported. Many have no other option but to return to traffickers who exploit their continued vulnerability,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cOther young people have become homeless as local authorities are unable to meet their needs in a way that makes them feel safe. When children approach adulthood they are particularly vulnerable to these risks as the support they receive is drastically reduced upon turning 18.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Modern Slavery in the UK 1/13 NCA has launched a touring photographic exhibition which aims to portray the signs of slavery and exploitation. Entitled \u2018Invisible People\u2019, the exhibition will tour the country as part of the National Crime Agency\u2019s campaign to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking. National Crime Agency 2/13 Child trafficking Child trafficking for sexual exploitation Traffickers use grooming techniques to gain the trust of a child, family or community. The children are recruited, transported and then sold for sex, often returning to their homes immediately afterwards, only to be picked up by the same people again. This is happening here in the UK, to migrant and British-born children. Spot the signs of child trafficking: Often, children won\u2019t be sure which country, city or town they\u2019re in. They may be orphaned or living apart from their family, in unregulated private foster care, or in substandard accommodation. They may possess unaccounted-for money or goods or repeatedly have new, unexplained injuries. National Crime Agency 3/13 Agriculture Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK. Victims of this crime in the agricultural sector are often Eastern European men and women, who were promised a job by traffickers, or they could be individuals on the fringes of society, homeless or destitute. Through threats, violence, coercion or forced drug and alcohol dependency, they\u2019re enslaved, working for little or no money, living in squalid conditions having had their identity documents taken from them. Spot the signs of exploitative labour in agriculture: Agricultural slaves often have their wages paid into the same bank account, meaning an illegal gangmaster is likely collecting all their wages. Exploited agriculture workers often don\u2019t have suitable protective equipment, working instead in cheap sports clothing and trainers, and don\u2019t have a different change of clothes from day-to-day. National Crime Agency 4/13 Food processing Polish or Slovakian men are brought to the UK with the offer of employment and, after arrival, gangmasters seize documents, opening multiple bank and utility accounts in their names \u2013 but refuse to handover access to the accounts or bank cards. Hours are long and the work is gruelling and dangerous. Workers are abused and are controlled by threats of harm to their families at home. Spot the signs: Those exploited wear inappropriate clothes and often no safety gear \u2013 despite working with dangerous and life-threatening equipment. They may often have untreated injuries and be refused medical attention, and will live and work in agricultural outhouses. National Crime Agency 5/13 Construction Labour-intensive sectors like construction, where temporary and irregular work are common, are high-risk sectors for forced labour. With new homes, offices and buildings being constructed or upgraded in great quantity, labour exploitation is the second most common type of modern slavery, after sexual exploitation. Spot the signs of exploitative labour in construction: Exploited workers are often not provided with protective clothing or equipment, and may show signs of abuse or carry old untreated injuries. Slave workers are also likely to work extremely long work hours for six or seven days a week without any leave. Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: \u201cI wanted this image to communicate that despite being forced to live, eat, wash and sleep \u2013 where they\u2019re working, in cramped and unhygienic conditions, that there is a human instinct to domesticate. I wanted to show how there is still hope and dignity in the most squalid and difficult of circumstances.\u201d National Crime Agency 6/13 Maritime In the tough maritime industry young men, often Filipino or Indian, Eastern European or African, are promised a better life, but instead find themselves in a cycle of debt and exploitation. Unable to read, they are offered a job, given papers to sign and begin working on a trial-basis, only to be told they have failed and owe money, and have to work more to settle the debt. They may be forced to work for long hours in intense, hazardous and difficult conditions. Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: \u201cIn the 80s, Chris Killip published a series of images called In Flagrante, and these images were at the forefront of my mind while composing this shot. I wanted to show the utter desperation of these men - how passed their limit they are. The broken floats and the entire decaying environment around him, I saw as a metaphor for his existence.\u201d Rory Carnegie/National Crime Agency 7/13 Forced prostitution Each year, women from across Eastern Europe and West Africa are lured to the UK by the dream of a better life. Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous individuals who befriend and then betray them, women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced, unpaid prostitution, unable to escape. Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: \u201cWhat I really wanted for this image, was to depict how women are used as commodities, the complete control slavery has over them \u2013 the helplessness of having to sit and wait for man after man, until no more men arrive. I wanted the image to show how lonely and eventually numbing that experience is, and for that ugliness to be contrasted against the bright blue of the wig \u2013 a fancy dress item that we would usually associate with a fun event \u2013 but here is used as a disguise, perhaps of her own identity to herself - to further emphasise how unjust the situation is.\u201d NCA 8/13 Cannabis farming The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door. Gangs bring young boys to the UK from countries like Vietnam and deliver them to a house where, once in, they won\u2019t be able to leave. Forced to tend cannabis plants that fill specially rigged houses, the boys are often locked in and forced to work, sleep and eat in one confined and dirty room. The chemicals used on the cannabis are poisonous, and often victims don\u2019t know where they are or how to get help if they do escape. The eyes, ears and compassion of the local community are essential. Spot the signs: Aside from the strong and prolonged smell of cannabis, have you noticed a house that looks unusual? Are the windows covered or usual entry points blocked? Buildings might be over-heated \u2013 in very cold weather is the roof without frost, because the house is being kept warm to grow plants National Crime Agency 9/13 Agriculture Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.

Poor English language skills could indicate exploitation because it suggests someone else must be arranging the work. A brothel is likely to be an average house on a normal looking street, but may have curtains which are usually closed and many different men coming and going frequently. National Crime Agency 11/13 Maritime Spot the signs of exploitative labour in the maritime sector: Victims might appear withdrawn or frightened, often unable to answer questions directed at them or speak for themselves,. They might be afraid of authorities like police, immigration or the tax office, and may perceive themselves to be in debt to someone else. They may not have been given proper protective equipment so can suffer illness or injury. Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: \u201cThroughout the series of images, I wanted to juxtapose the harshness of the lives of slaves against bright primary colours \u2013 colours we traditionally associate with happiness or a feeling of wellbeing \u2013 to provoke a reaction. The image, as rich as it is, communicates how completely uncomfortable this person is. I wanted to show how his body is not his own, and how he has no right to avoid hardship, avoid the ice, or wear better shoes, he is utterly controlled.\u201d Rory Carnegie/National Crime Agency 12/13 Food processing Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: \u201cThis image communicates utter exhaustion and dejection. We can see how dire his situation is.

National Crime Agency\n\nOne foster carer, who has cared for a number of child victims over the last few years, told The Independent she was having to \u201cfight\u201d to get the youngsters in her care the support they were legally eligible for at \u201cevery stage\u201d.\n\nShe said one of the children in her care had was initially not considered to be a victim when she was referred to the NRM because the referral was \u201crushed through\u201d by the local authority. police, who submitted the referral within the first 24 hours.\n\nIn another case, she said the principal education lead in a child\u2019s case had suggested they didn\u2019t need to go to school and instead be supported with 10 hours of one-to-one classes per week, despite full-time education being an entitlement.\n\nThe foster carer said: \u201cThe NRM process is too often rushed and doesn\u2019t match up to what it says in the guidance. People need time. You\u2019ve got young people for whom it\u2019s so far removed to their understanding. Everything is difficult to understand,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in this surreal place where I\u2019m the foster carer and I\u2019m having to have debates with professionals from across the multi-agency team.\u201d\n\nCllr Simon Blackburn, chair of the LGA\u2019s safer and stronger communities board, said the spiralling rate of council referrals, especially relating to county lines drug trafficking or child sexual exploitation, were having a \u201chuge impact on overstretched council services, particularly children\u2019s services\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cCouncils are committed to tackling the despicable crime of modern slavery, which is a rising threat to our communities. It can destroy the lives of vulnerable people working in fear of physical violence from ruthless gangmasters for little or no pay.\n\n\u201cExtra funding next year will help but government needs to ensure councils have adequate long-term resources to tackle this abuse and support its victims, as well as creating a sustainable NRM system in the long term.\u201d\n\nThe LGA\u2019s analysis follows warnings that unaccompanied minors in the UK were being driven to self-harm and suicide due to \u201cgaps in statutory support\u201d provided to them, which in some cases has led them to take their own lives.\n\nCharities warned that many unaccompanied minors are at severe risk of trafficking on arrival in the UK, but that a lack of one-to-one support means they are not adequately protected from exploitation.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cModern slavery and child exploitation are barbaric crimes and we remain committed to stamping them out and supporting victims.\n\n\u201cFactors like county lines-related criminality are thought to be driving the increase of child referrals to the National Referral Mechanism. The world leading Modern Slavery Act ensures that we are identifying and protecting vulnerable children, including those exploited by county lines gangs.\u201d", "description": "Child victims of modern slavery are being lured back into exploitation and falling into homelessness as cash-strapped local authorities struggle to cope with a surge in cases, charities have warned.
