(AP) - Cornerback Tre\u2019Davious White occasionally enjoys parading around the Buffalo Bills facility in goaltending gear while claiming to have been the best hockey player in his native Louisiana history.\n\nIt\u2019s all fiction, including The Tre\u2019Davious White Goalie Academy, where he supposedly taught Buffalo Sabres starter Carter Hutton all he knows. White, in fact, was unfamiliar with hockey until last year, when he became a big fan of Hutton while attending his first NHL game.\n\nThe outing was filmed by the team\u2019s promotional department, and prompted the Pegula-owned Bills and Sabres to produce a \u201cmock-umentary\u201d in which White proudly says: \u201cI\u2019ve never allowed a goal.\u201d\n\nAll joking aside, White was immediately captivated by Hutton because he can appreciate how a goalie\u2019s role is no different than his.\n\n\u201cUltimately, I don\u2019t want to be embarrassed out there. So, when you\u2019re the last line of defense, and somebody catches the ball on you, that\u2019s all everybody\u2019s going to talk about, right?\u201d White said. \u201cJust like a touchdown or when somebody scores a goal, you want to try to defend the goal, and the team is depending on you to try to save the day.\u201d\n\nPreferring pigskins over pucks, the third-year player has generated an impressive save percentage for making key stops particularly in the clutch.\n\nOn Wednesday, with Buffalo (5-1) preparing to host Philadelphia (3-4) this weekend, White earned his first AFC defensive player of the week honors.\n\nIt came after he forced two momentum-changing second-half turnovers, allowing Buffalo to rally from a five-point fourth-quarter deficit in a 31-21 victory over winless Miami last weekend.\n\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s just the first step,\u201d said White, who has on several occasions voiced his objective of becoming the NFL\u2019s top cornerback. \u201cI always felt like those accolades would come if the team wins. And so far we\u2019re winning and people are paying attention. I mean, as long as we win, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\nBoth turnovers led directly to Buffalo touchdowns, starting with White\u2019s diving interception of Ryan Fitzpatrick\u2019s pass at the Buffalo 2 to end a 16-play third-quarter-opening drive. Two series later, White punched the ball out of receiver Preston Williams\u2019 hands, with the fumble recovered by teammate Jerry Hughes.\n\n\u201cBig-time players make big-time plays in big-time moments, and he\u2019s a big-time player since he got here,\u201d safety Micah Hyde said. \u201cThat\u2019s just Tre. What\u2019s he call himself? Fourth-quarter Tre? That\u2019s when he starts playing really well.\u201d\n\nOf White\u2019s 13 career takeaways (including nine interceptions), 12 have come in the second half.\n\nIn Week 3, he clinched a 21-17 win over Cincinnati by intercepting Andy Dalton\u2019s pass that tipped off Hyde\u2019s hands at the Buffalo 10 with 12 seconds remaining.\n\nIt was no different during his rookie season in 2017.\n\nWhite sealed a 16-10 win at Kansas City by intercepting Alex Smith\u2019s pass at the Buffalo 27 with 1:10 remaining. He also forced and recovered Adam Humphries\u2019 fumble with 2:28 left to set up Stephen Hauschka\u2019s 30-yard game-deciding field goal in a 30-27 win over Tampa Bay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny you bring that Tampa game up,\u201d defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier said Monday.\n\n\u201cWhat he did yesterday was very similar. But we\u2019ve seen it in his three short years here: He finds a way to come up with big plays in some tough moments,\u201d Frazier added. \u201cThere\u2019s no situation too big for him, no circumstance that scares him.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NFL\u2019s Next Gen Stats, quarterbacks have completed 44.8 percent of their attempts thrown in White\u2019s direction, and he leads the league with a 26.6 defender passer rating based on a minimum 20 targets this season.\n\nFrom Shreveport, Buffalo\u2019s 2017 first-round draft pick honed his skills at LSU, where White practiced against a group of receivers that included Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry.\n\nWhite drew on those experiences when picking off Fitzpatrick\u2019s pass intended for Isaiah Ford, who broke off his route and cut to the right sideline.\n\n\u201cJust from practicing and being beat on that route so many times,\u201d White said. \u201cIt comes from trial and error, just being in that position so many times, and trusting my feet and trusting my eyes.\u201d\n\nNo different than a goalie.\n\nHutton was impressed by White\u2019s performance against Miami, and gets a big laugh out of the hockey-related videos the Bills have produced.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a character for sure,\u201d Hutton said. \u201cI think it\u2019s great to have personalities. I think it\u2019s great for fans to see the human side of us, too. We like to have fun. We\u2019re not just robots.\u201d\n\nHutton, off to a 6-0 start this season, winked in saying White hasn\u2019t taught him everything about goaltending.\n\n\u201cNo, no. He taught me a lot but not everything,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite\u2019s not giving up his day job just yet, though he\u2019s prepared to pull on his gear in a pinch.\n\n\u201cIf the Sabres need an emergency goalie, I\u2019m up for it if coach (Sean) McDermott will let me,\u201d White said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cornerback Tre'Davious White occasionally enjoys parading around the Buffalo Bills facility in goaltending gear while claiming to have been the best hockey player in his native Louisiana history.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/dolphins_bills_football_31658_c0-153-2141-1401_s1200x700.jpg?148c34f61c6b500c093893543c55332d1005196e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
