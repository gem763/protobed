His throwing hand collided with Aaron Donald\u2019s outstretched hand while he threw an incompletion on the Saints\u2019 second drive, and the NFL\u2019s career leader in yards passing spent the afternoon on the Coliseum sideline with his thumb heavily wrapped.\n\nTeddy Bridgewater went 17 of 30 for 165 yards and Alvin Kamara rushed for just 45 yards for the Saints, who seemed discombobulated without their longtime quarterback.\n\nATLANTA (AP) - Julio Jones hauled in a short screen pass on fourth down and took it 54 yards to the end zone with 2:10 remaining, giving the Atlanta Falcons a wild 24-20 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nA sluggish game turned thrilling in the final minutes. The Falcons squandered a 17-6 lead against an injury plagued team that lost two of its top receivers, falling behind for the first time when Carson Wentz dove over from the 1 with 3:13 left to give the Eagles a 20-17 edge.\n\nPhiladelphia had a chance at the end when Wentz converted on fourth-and-14, somehow getting off a pass with a rusher in his chest that Nelson Agholor hauled in between two defenders for a 43-yard completion to the 18.\n\nBut Atlanta held on, stopping Zach Ertz less than a yard short of the marker on another fourth-down play inside the 10 to preserve a much-needed victory.\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) - Russell Wilson threw for three touchdowns, including a 28-yard rainbow to DK Metcalf midway through the fourth quarter, and the Seattle Seahawks held off the Pittsburgh Steelers 28-26.\n\nThe Steelers lost starting quarterback Ben Roethlisberger to a right elbow injury late in the first half and fell to 0-2 for the first time since 2013 despite solid play from backup Mason Rudolph, who threw a pair of second-half touchdown passes to Vance McDonald in relief.\n\nRoethlisberger began flexing his right arm after an incompletion late in the second quarter. He stayed in to finish the drive before jogging to the locker room. When the 37-year-old QB emerged for the second half, he was wearing a white cap while Rudolph, taken in the third round of the 2018 draft, took the first meaningful snaps of his career.\n\nRudolph completed 12 of 19 passes for 112 yards, the two scores and an interception but couldn\u2019t quite keep pace with Wilson and the Seahawks.\n\nWilson was 29 of 35 for 300 yards and the three TDs, becoming the fifth-fastest quarterback in league history to reach 200 career touchdown passes (114 games). Wilson also ran four times for 24 yards.\n\nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) - Antonio Brown caught a 20-yard touchdown pass in his debut for the New England Patriots, and they scored twice on interception returns in a two-minute fourth-quarter span to beat the Miami Dolphins, 43-0.\n\nBrown also made an 18-yard catch on his first play for the Patriots, who signed him Monday. He finished with 56 yards on four receptions, all in the first half.\n\nThe NFL allowed the four-time All-Pro receiver to play despite a civil lawsuit filed Tuesday by his former trainer accusing him of sexually assaulting her on three occasions. The NFL plans to meet with the woman on Monday.\n\nNew England\u2019s defense outscored Miami with interception returns for touchdowns of 54 yards by Stephon Gilmore and 69 yards by Jamie Collins Sr. The Patriots totaled seven sacks and four interceptions and earned their most lopsided win in the 108-game history of the series.\n\nBASEBALL\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) - Mike Trout\u2019s season is over.\n\nThe Los Angeles Angels say the eight-time All-Star will have surgery on his right foot this week because of Morton\u2019s neuroma, a thickening of tissue around a nerve leading to toes that causes pain.\n\nTrout was scheduled to fly with the team to New York on Sunday evening for a series with the Yankees that starts Tuesday. He is to return to Los Angeles on Thursday and have surgery later in the week.\n\nTrout finished with a career-high 45 home runs, 104 RBIs and a .291 batting average, putting him in contention to win his third AL MVP award along with four second-place finishes. The 28-year-old outfielder had 110 walks, a .438 on-base percentage and 1.083 OPS in his first season after agreeing to a $426.5 million, 12-year contract, baseball\u2019s largest deal by total and average salary.\n\nCHICAGO (AP) - Star first baseman Anthony Rizzo was pulled from the game with a sprained right ankle, putting a damper on the Chicago Cubs\u2019 16-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nRizzo was injured fielding a bunt at first base in the third inning. He had to be helped off the field and could not put pressure on the leg. X-rays taken at Wrigley Field showed no fractures, and an MRI has been scheduled for Monday.\n\nChicago\u2019s postseason pursuit has already been hindered by an injury to shortstop Javier B\u00e1ez, who is out for the rest of the regular season with a hairline fracture of his left thumb.\n\nThe Cubs maintained their one-game lead over Milwaukee for the second NL wild card. The Nationals are 1 1/2 games ahead of Chicago for the first wild card.\n\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - California and Arizona State moved into the AP Top 25 college football poll to give the Pac-12 six ranked teams, the most for the conference in almost four years.\n\nA weekend filled with blowouts left the top half of the AP media poll presented by Regions Bank mostly unchanged.\n\nClemson remains No. 1, with 57 of the 62 first-place votes, as the top nine held their spots. Alabama was No. 2, receiving five first-place votes, followed by Georgia, LSU, Oklahoma, Ohio State, Notre Dame, Auburn and Florida.\n\nThe ninth-ranked Gators were the only top-10 team to play a competitive game. The others won by a combined 428-97.\n\nUtah, the highest ranked Pac-12 team, moved up to No. 10. The last time the Pac-12 had six ranked teams was Nov. 8, 2015.\n\nAUTO RACING\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) - Martin Truex Jr. raced his way into the second round of NASCAR\u2019s playoffs with a victory at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in the opening round of the postseason.\n\nThe win was Truex\u2019s series-best fifth of the season and again cemented Joe Gibbs Racing as the team to beat in this 10-race playoff series. JGR has 14 wins in its Toyotas this season through 27 races.\n\nTruex chased down Kevin Harvick, who was slowed by traffic, to cut into Harvick\u2019s lead and eventually make the pass for the win - and the automatic second-round spot - on the outside with 20 laps remaining.\n\nLas Vegas was a brutal opener for a handful of title contenders, including Kurt Busch, who crashed when his tire went flat and he finished last in the field. Erik Jones had an earlier mechanical issue and finished four spots higher in 36th.\n\nThe top 10 finishers were all playoff contenders as Truex was followed by Harvick, Brad Keselowski, Chase Elliott, Ryan Blaney, Alex Bowman, William Byron, Kyle Larson, reigning series champion Joey Logano and Ryan Newman.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "NFL", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
