He asked a judge to decide whether he should accede to House demands for his testimony or to assert \u201cimmunity from congressional process\u201d as directed by Trump.\n\nKupperman, who provided foreign policy advice to the president, has been called to testify because the impeachment inquiry is rooted in a July 25 phone call Trump made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. During the call, Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to pursue investigations of Democratic political rival Joe Biden\u2019s family and Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election that propelled Trump into the White House.\n\nAt the time of the call, Trump was withholding congressionally approved military aid for Ukraine. He has repeatedly said there was no quid pro quo for the Ukraine investigations he was seeking, though witness testimony has contradicted that claim.\n\nKupperman said he \u201ccannot satisfy the competing demands of both the legislative and executive branches.\u201d Without the court\u2019s help, he said, he would have to make the decision himself \u2014 one that could \u201cinflict grave constitutional injury\u201d on either Congress or the presidency.\n\nHis filing says \u201can erroneous judgment to abide by the President\u2019s assertion of testimonial immunity would unlawfully impede the House from carrying out one of its most important core Constitutional responsibilities\u201d \u2014 the power of impeachment \u2014 and subject Kupperman to \u201cpotential criminal liability for contempt of Congress.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, \u201can erroneous judgment to appear and testify in obedience to the House Defendants\u2019 subpoena would unlawfully impair the President in the exercise of his core national security responsibilities ... by revealing confidential communications\u201d from advisers, according to the filing.\n\nHe has asked the court to expedite a decision, but unless the judge issues an opinion by Monday, Kupperman\u2019s testimony might not occur as scheduled.\n\nThe lawsuit came as Democrats investigating the president won a victory in a separate case. A federal judge ordered the Justice Department on Friday to give the House secret grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and affirmed the legality of the Democrats impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cTo the extent the House\u2019s role in the impeachment context is to investigate misconduct by the President and ascertain whether that conduct amounts to an impeachable offense warranting removal from office, the House performs a function somewhat akin to a grand jury,\u201d U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump tweeted that he\u2019s \u201cnot concerned with the impeachment scam. I am not because I did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 inquiry continued at full speed Saturday with a rare weekend session. Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state for Europe, testified behind closed doors.\n\nAs was the case with other witnesses, the Trump administration directed Reeker not to testify, according to two people familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the interaction. But Reeker appeared anyway after receiving his subpoena from the House, the people said.\n\nReeker was expected to corroborate testimony from previous witnesses who have described the Trump administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, according to a person familiar with Reeker\u2019s role in Ukraine policy. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss the testimony and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAlthough he is currently the top U.S. diplomat for Europe and has been since Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovich was recalled earlier this year, Reeker was not directly involved in debate over aid to Ukraine, which other current and former officials have said was delegated to Sondland and Volker.\n\nVolker testified and released text messages that detailed conversations between him, Sondland and Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine. In the messages, Taylor wrote that he thought it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to withhold aid from Ukraine for help with a political campaign. Sondland and Taylor, who still work for the government, have already testified and detailed their concerns about the influence of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Ukraine. Giuliani was leading the push for the investigations.\n\nTaylor testified that he was told the aid would be withheld until Ukraine conducted the investigations that Trump had requested.\n\n___\n\nAP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee and Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.", "description": "An ex-White House adviser is supposed to testify in the House impeachment investigation, but the White House directed him against cooperating.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db4a8af210000df2c34b233.jpeg?cache=3llfazj3zq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
