(Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cMan, they\u2019re going to be telling stories about that kid for a while,\u201d Yankees All-Star outfielder Aaron Judge said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a Yankee great, I know it. He just comes to work every single day. He\u2019s always got a smile on his face. No situation is too big.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see him in the box, bases loaded, big situation and he\u2019ll give us a little smile in the dugout like he knows he\u2019s going to go up there and do his job.\n\n\u201cJust a special individual.\u201d\n\nAt 22 years old, @TorresGleyber is the youngest @Yankees player ever to drive in 5 runs in a #postseason game. pic.twitter.com/hgaDwMe1cH \u2014 MLB Stats (@MLBStats) October 13, 2019\n\nTorres is the trade acquisition that keeps on giving, with the Yankees sending closer Aroldis Chapman to the Chicago Cubs at the trade deadline in 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, Masahiro Tanaka is quietly establishing himself as one of the greatest postseason pitchers in Yankee history.\n\nTanaka, who had never defeated the Astros in seven starts in his career (0-2, 6.62 ERA in seven starts), breezed through six innings, needing just 68 pitches. He yielded just a lone single to rookie Kyle Tucker in the third inning. He was so dominant that the Astros managed only four balls to be hit out of the infield.\n\nHe becomes the first pitcher in baseball history to yield four or fewer hits and two or less runs in his first seven postseason starts.\n\nTanaka\u2019s postseason ERA now dropped to 1.32, the second-lowest in history, trailing only Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax (0.95 ERA).\n\nThe Astros did everything they possibly could do to rattle Tanaka, but nothing worked, as he went toe-to-toe with Astros former Cy Young winner Zack Greinke, and outlasted him.\n\nTanaka refused to lose his composure, saying before the game that he would rely on his experience in the 2017 ALCS when the Yankees lost all four games in Houston.\n\n\u201cOne thing I can say is that we've been here in 2017,\u2019\u2019 Tanaka said. \u201cWe know what it's like in here.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd now the Astros know what it\u2019s like to face the Yankees\u2019 relentless lineup, which produced 13 hits, and showed no fear playing at Minute Maid Park, where the Astros won 61 games during the regular season.\n\nIt perhaps it\u2019s silly believing it was a must-win game for the Yankees, but considering that Verlander and Cole are scheduled to pitch four times in the next six games, they really couldn\u2019t afford not to win.\n\nNow, the pressure turns to the Astros.\n\nThey can\u2019t go back to the Bronx down 0-2.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re about to buckle up,\u2019\u2019 Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "Yankees second baseman Gleyber Torres drove in five runs and New York beat the Astros 7-0 in Game 1 of the ALCS.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
