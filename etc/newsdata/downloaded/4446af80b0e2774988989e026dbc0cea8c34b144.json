Largely untouched by a government clampdown on nearly every other form of non-bank financing, the industry has grown from obscurity into a major source of funding for cash-strapped Chinese companies.\n\nThe worry now is that products arranged by independent wealth managers will face mounting losses as China\u2019s economic slowdown deepens and corporate defaults surge. Confidence in the industry has plunged since July, when Noah Holdings Ltd. said that 3.4 billion yuan ($477 million) of credit products overseen by one of its units were exposed to an alleged fraud by a Chinese conglomerate. U.S.-listed shares of Noah, one of China\u2019s biggest independent wealth managers, have tumbled 38% in the past three months.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see some losses,\u201d said Jasper Yip, Hong Kong-based principal of financial services at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm. \u201cMore borrowers will run into payment difficulties in a slowing economy.\u201d\n\nThe repercussions could be significant if losses on such products fuel a broader retreat from high-yield assets in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. One factor that concerns analysts: Because the products are opaque and regulation is minimal, nobody knows exactly how much money is at risk.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear from financial statements published by Noah and Jupai Holdings Ltd., another U.S.-listed independent wealth manager, is that the industry has experienced breakneck growth.\n\nAssets under management at a Noah unit that structures its own products climbed 40% to 169.2 billion yuan in the two years ended December 2018 -- a period when the broader Chinese shadow banking system shrank because of tighter regulations. Jupai\u2019s assets under sole or shared management have more than quadrupled since 2015 to 56.8 billion yuan, according to the company. Official industrywide figures don\u2019t exist, but Noah estimated in 2016 that China had upwards of 8,000 independent wealth managers.\n\nRead more: A Guide to China\u2019s Shadow-Banking Maze\n\nWhile the firms offer a wide variety of investments including plain-vanilla mutual funds, many of the products are backed by high-yield loans to companies -- often property developers -- that lack access to traditional sources of funding like banks.\n\nBecause the credit products are sold only to investors who have at least 3 million yuan of financial assets or earned an average 500,000 yuan in the past three years, they fall outside the increasingly strict rules governing mainstream wealth management products offered by Chinese banks. While WMP holdings of non-standard credit assets (mostly corporate loans) are capped at 35%, the credit products issued by independent wealth managers aren\u2019t subject to any such limits.\n\nThat has allowed them to ramp up exposure to riskier debt and offer higher yields, a major draw for investors at a time when the rates on traditional WMPs have been falling. Marketing materials for some of Noah\u2019s products show an expected annualized return of 7.7% for an investment duration of 9 months, five times higher than the benchmark deposit rate.\n\nCritics of independent wealth managers including Sun Jianbo, president of China Vision Capital Management in Beijing, argue that the firms often understate the risks of their products when marketing to investors.\n\nThat worry has only deepened in recent months as China\u2019s economy slowed to the weakest pace since at least 1992 and the nation\u2019s companies defaulted on domestic bonds at the fastest pace on record. Noah\u2019s failure to spot the risks of lending to Camsing International Holding Ltd., the conglomerate it accuses of fraud and whose chairman was detained by Chinese police in June, provided another reason for caution. The Camsing case is still under investigation by police, who haven\u2019t announced any charges.\n\nRead more: A $117 Billion Chinese Wealth Manager Says It Was Scammed\n\nNoah said in an emailed statement that it\u2019s offering loans at preferential rates to some clients whose money is tied up in products affected by the case. Camsing and the China Securities Regulatory Commission didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Jupai, whose stock has dropped 50% in New York this year, didn\u2019t reply to questions on its market performance.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Analysts on the lookout for China\u2019s next financial shock are training their sights on the least regulated corner of the nation\u2019s sprawling shadow banking system.Their concern centers on so-called independent wealth managers, which have expanded rapidly in recent years by selling high-yield", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Dtpglf84R9mJ5RP21QdOQw--~B/aD03ODQ7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/2f21ad8809fe2c1261c1a20de8175029", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
