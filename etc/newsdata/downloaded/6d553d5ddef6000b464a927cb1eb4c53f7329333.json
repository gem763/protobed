So why does it still smell like mildew?", "language": "en", "text": "Q: Earlier this year, a downspout came loose, and water infiltrated my condo bedroom. It took the property manager 3\u00bd months to repair it, so a lot of water came in. After the repair, I waited five months for the walls to dry out, during which there was a strong mold/mildew smell. When I brought in a plasterer, he removed the damaged plaster. A worker applied a white sealant, Zinsser Odorless Oil-Based Stain Blocker, and returned to spray mold/mildew killer. That was five weeks ago. After a few days, the smell was still as strong as before, so I bought the same product \u2014 it smells like Clorox \u2014 and sprayed the walls every third day. The mildew smell lessened only a small amount. I found a recommendation online to apply vinegar to kill the odor. I have done that three times over the past week. The smell has lessened a bit, but I worry that if I proceed to get new plaster and paint, the mold/mildew will come through. How should I eliminate the odor?\n\nWashington\n\nA: Hire a licensed mold assessor to test your walls and the air to make sure the underlying issue \u2014 excessive moisture \u2014 has been addressed. A persistent smell hints that mold or mildew (the term for specific kinds of mold) may still be growing because moisture levels are high.\n\nIf you were to hire a company that does assessments as well as remediation and were told more remediation work needs to be done, you may wonder whether the advice was just a way to drum up more business. So hire a company that does mold assessments but not remediation work, suggested Joe Mulieri, owner of MoldGone in Silver Spring (240-970-6533; moldgone.net), which does both types of work throughout the Washington area. He said an assessment might cost a few hundred dollars. The D.C. government website lists licensed mold professionals in two categories: assessors and remediators. To view the list, type \u201cmold professionals\u201d into the search box at DC.gov .\n\nAssuming you aren\u2019t seeing any mold now, the smell could be coming from inside the wall cavities, perhaps within insulation stuffed into the walls, with the smells then wafting into the room through gaps around trim and between the walls and flooring. These air gaps could also be allowing warm, moisture-laden air to settle on a cold surface, where it condenses and raises the moisture level enough to support mildew growth. If the room didn\u2019t have a moldy smell before the gutter problem, it\u2019s possible that 3\u00bd months of leaks soaked the insulation enough to compress it, allowing condensation to occur where it wasn\u2019t an issue before. Or mildew could be in the ceiling or the floor, perhaps in carpet padding.\n\nIf the walls in your condo were covered in drywall, the best solution probably would be to remove the damaged materials, see what\u2019s going on inside the wall and start fresh. Replacing drywall makes sense because mildew can feed on the paper that covers both sides of drywall\u2019s gypsum core and because drywall is relatively inexpensive to replace.\n\nPlaster, however, is less prone to harboring mildew because it doesn\u2019t provide food for mildew, and it is more expensive to replace. \u201cPlaster is more dense and less absorbent than drywall,\u201d Mulieri said. Although it\u2019s sometimes necessary to remove plaster to address hidden issues, it\u2019s often sufficient \u2014 once a leak is plugged \u2014 to go with the procedure your plasterer used: scraping off the outer layer, then apply an encapsulant. Mulieri said he uses AfterShock, a sealant produced by Fiberlock Technologies that was designed to disinfect surfaces and prevent mold from re-growing.\n\nMany contractors, like yours, encapsulate by using a less-expensive oil-based sealer, such as Zinsser Odorless Oil-Based Stain Blocker or Kilz Orignal. But if you read the technical documents for these products, they don\u2019t mention using them to encapsulate mildew. The Zinsser product sheet says only that it blocks stains from water, fire and smoke damage, while the Kilz sheet says it blocks stains from a longer list of sources and \u201cseals pet, food and smoke odors.\u201d There is no mention of mildew with either product.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s possible that if the moisture issue has been corrected and the visible mold cleaned up, you could be ready to have the plaster repaired and painted. To know for sure, arrange for a visit from someone who understands mildew issues and can test the air and surfaces. There is no way to eliminate mildew \u2014 spores are always in the air \u2014 but the testing should reveal whether the wall and air have elevated levels.\n\nThere is a lot of confusion about how mildew grows and the risks it poses. People often focus on \u201ckilling\u201d mildew by spraying it with bleach or similar products. But that kills only mildew hit by the spray.\n\nAnd if you inhale dead spores, the health risks are the same as if they were alive. That\u2019s why the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s advice for do-it-yourself mildew cleanup focuses on wiping away mildew, using just water and detergent, on hard surfaces. The EPA says consumers can generally clean up moldy areas of less than 10 square feet by following its safety advice, which you can read by typing \u201cmold cleanup in your home\u201d into the search box at EPA.gov. For larger areas, it recommends getting a pro \u2014 one that is licensed.", "description": "A simple sealant may not be enough.
