But the British currency pulled back on Wednesday.\n\nMany analysts expect more volatility.\n\n\"The fate of the British Pound largely depends on the Brexit outcome but more than three years since the referendum to leave the EU, the Brexit process is in deadlock and the future is mired in confusion and political upheaval,\" said Joseph Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions.\n\nAmong individual companies, Dow member Nike surged 4.2 percent after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits on strong direct sales and higher revenues from China.\n\nPhilip Morris International rose 5.2 percent as it and Altria called off a potential $200 billion merger following a sudden surge in worries about vaping.
