I think its inhumane that it causes the rats to slowly die.\n\n\"But more importantly the poison isn't killing the rats, they are becoming immune to it.\"\n\nHe said his plan would involve a \"good professional system\" where shooting clubs would be invited to \"come at set times to cull the rats\".\n\nMr Anderson said he had not seen any evidence of rats \"eating bricks and through walls\" and that Mr Radford's suggestion \"doesn't deserve any credibility at all\".\n\n\"It's silly and absurd to think we would allow people to shoot vermin in the street,\" he added.\n\nHe said limiting food waste on the streets and running poising programmes were \"the most effective and cost effective way\" of dealing with the problem.\n\nIan Furlong, director of Independent Pest Control and Hygiene Services Ltd in Liverpool, agreed the best way to prevent rat infestations was to keep food waste in closed bins.\n\nHe said shooting rats on city streets \"is never going to happen\" and stressed rats are not immune to poisoning.", "description": "Rats are damaging walls in Liverpool by \"burrowing underneath them\", a councillor claims.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FF74/production/_109269356_002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
