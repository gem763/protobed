However, the PoS variant has raised doubts regarding the integrity of random selections.\n\nScott Aaronson, a quantum theoretician at the University of Texas at Austin, told Fortune on Oct. 23 that quantum computing could assuage PoS-skeptics doubts, as a quantum supremacy experiment could generate certifiably random numbers. He previously wrote on his personal blog:\n\n\u201cA sampling-based quantum supremacy experiment could almost immediately be repurposed to generate bits that can be proven to be random to a skeptical third party (under computational assumptions). This, in turn, has possible applications to proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies and other cryptographic protocols. I\u2019m hopeful that more such applications will be discovered in the near future.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s project challenges the Church-Turing thesis\n\nOn Oct. 23, Google published the results of its quantum supremacy experiment, which Aaronson peer-reviewed. In the experiment, \u201cSycamore\u201d \u2014 a 54-qubit processor with quantum logic gates \u2014 took 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times. In contrast, IBM\u2019s supercomputer Summit, which is purportedly the most powerful computer to date, would run such a calculation for 10,000 years.\n\nGoogle states that its experiment is the first experimental challenge against the extended Church-Turing thesis \u2014 also known as computability thesis \u2014 which claims that traditional computers can effectively carry out any \u201creasonable\u201d model of computation. In a dedicated blog post, Google explained:\n\n\u201cWe first ran random simplified circuits from 12 up to 53 qubits, keeping the circuit depth constant. We checked the performance of the quantum computer using classical simulations and compared with a theoretical model. Once we verified that the system was working, we ran random hard circuits with 53 qubits and increasing depth, until reaching the point where classical simulation became infeasible. [...] With the first quantum computation that cannot reasonably be emulated on a classical computer, we have opened up a new realm of computing to be explored.\u201d\n\nIs Bitcoin affected?\n\nPreviously, ex-Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd poured cold water on fears that recent advances in quantum computing could endanger the security of Bitcoin (BTC) \u2014 which is a proof-of-work-based cryptocurrency. Todd concluded that financial impediments alone would keep Bitcoin free from potential trouble.", "description": "Google\u2019s quantum computer could purportedly help improve the random selection process of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9jNTg5NzIxZWU1OGZjYzk1MzFmYjRiNTMyZDJiODAzYi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
