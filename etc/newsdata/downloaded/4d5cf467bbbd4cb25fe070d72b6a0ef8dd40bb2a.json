(AP Photo/Ryan Kang)\n\nAs if disarming a gunman in the presence of high school students wasn\u2019t a laudable feat enough, the manner in which ex-Oregon wide receiver Keanon Lowe did so back on May 17 is truly astonishing.\n\nThrough a public records request, KOIN 6 News obtained video surveillance footage of the college football star-turned high school coach leading the formerly-armed 18-year-old Angel Granados-Diaz out of a classroom at Parkrose High School and handing off his loaded shotgun to another person.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLowe appears to hug, and perhaps console Granados-Diaz, who according to an official, came on campus during a mental health crisis.\n\nBreaking News: video of Coach Keanon Lowe disarming Parkrose High School gunman Angel Granados-Diaz.

He pled guilty in early October.\n\nLowe played at Oregon from 2011-14. He had 68 catches for 891 yards and 11 touchdowns in his Ducks career. He averaged nearly 15 yards per catch in 2014, the year Oregon went to the College Football Playoff National Championship Game and lost to Ohio State.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The former Oregon star appears to hug and console a student who reportedly entered campus with the intent to kill himself.", "authors": ["Torrey Hart"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/puPHwcHxr42g1AFwkm86BQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KWdxiP0f3fPRHaKfCI5Yxw--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-05/53174210-78f3-11e9-875f-2eeb29ca23eb", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
