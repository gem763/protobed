The president earlier this month released the aid after lawmakers raised concerns.\n\n\"He allegedly sought to use the very security assistance dollars appropriated by Congress to create stability in the world, to help root out corruption and to protect our national security interests, for his own personal gain,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent.\"\n\nThe congressional Democrats decried Trump's actions as a \"flagrant disregard for the law,\" adding that they \"cannot stand.\"\n\nTrump on Monday denied discussing military aid with Zelensky during his talks with the Ukrainian leader, telling reporters at the United Nations General Assembly that he \"did not make a statement that you have to do this or I\u2019m not going to give you aid.\"\n\nThe latest allegations against Trump have led to renewed calls from many Democrats to launch impeachment proceedings against the president.
