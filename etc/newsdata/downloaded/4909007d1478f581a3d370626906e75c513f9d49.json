Putin responded by saying that Russia would begin developing short- and intermediate-range land-launched nuclear missiles if it hears the United States has done the same.\n\nThe agreement between the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union eliminated thousands of land-based ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as nuclear missiles, from the stocks of both nations. The INF specifically banned missiles with ranges between 310 and 3,410 miles. The U.S. has claimed Russia\u2019s Novator 9M729 missile violated the treaty, as it has a range up to approximately 3,410 miles.\n\nThe White House had announced in February that it was suspending its INF obligations and gave Russia six months to comply with the treaty, or else it would withdraw.\n\nThree weeks after exiting the INF, the U.S. tested a ground-based cruise missile armed with a conventional warhead that traveled more than 310 miles, which would have been in violation of the agreement. Officials have said the missile could eventually double that range.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPutin has said that Russia and the U.S. should resume talks for a possible new treaty in order to avoid an \u201cunfettered\u201d arms race, which he accuses the United States of encouraging.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see an arms race happening here,\u201d Esper has said. \u201cRussia has been racing, if anybody, to develop these systems in violation of the treaty, not us.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Vladimir Putin\u00a0warned the U.S. once again this week that Russia would\u00a0develop missiles\u00a0previously banned under a\u00a0landmark\u00a0nuclear forces treaty\u00a0if it learns\u00a0that\u00a0the United States has begun building them.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/ContentBroker_contentid-3e8142f3fb52414eb9587b0c3527e6e5.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
