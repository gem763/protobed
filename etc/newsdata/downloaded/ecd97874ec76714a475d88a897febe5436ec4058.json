But the slump in prized holdings will add to a perception that the investments are subject to unpredictable swings even as the company works to provide more disclosure.\n\nThe losses from Uber and other investments in the third quarter come after those positions had delivered big gains in previous periods.\n\nWall Street banks grappled with increased volatility in the third quarter, while executives grew cautious about its benefits to their trading desks. Goldman had snatched market share from weaker rivals in a boost for its operations earlier in the year.\n\nGoldman Sachs is in the middle of a significant strategic shift as it retools businesses. The push includes a nascent consumer-banking effort, cash-management tools and new initiatives to win more business from existing clients. The firm also rolled out credit cards as part of a partnership with Apple.\n\nInvestors and analysts still await a more-detailed strategic update from Solomon, who took the top job more than a year ago. He has vowed to tighten up the partnership ranks and installed new leaders across divisions, even as he works for a resolution to the 1MDB banking scandal.\n\nFees from helping companies sell shares dropped 20 per cent from the second quarter to $US385 million. Embattled office-sharing firm WeWork and Ari Emanuel's Endeavor Group abandoned plans for an IPO amid tepid investor interest. The debt-capital markets business brought in $US586 million, a decline from the previous quarter.\n\nThe firm did highlight an increase in its investment-banking backlog and will also benefit when Saudi Aramco brings its mammoth share sale to market. It's advising on a potentially massive share sale for the oil giant, with the fee pool for advisers likely to total as much as $US450 million.\n\nThe growth of Goldman's Marcus business, which offers consumer loans and savings accounts, has forced the bank to pay attention to falling rates. The firm cut the amount of interest it pays depositors with online savings accounts at least three times since June. But Goldman's lending to private wealth clients as well as through Marcus resulted in $US891 million of net interest income, a record for a quarter.\n\nBloomberg", "description": "The firm took a $395 million hit on PE investments such as ride-hailing company Uber, Avantor and Tradeweb Markets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_138/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b41604a314440565a46e7469ff9465026f3992a2", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
