Back then, a lovely private room in a small, locally owned hotel in a relatively luxurious treehouse-like setting overlooking the sea cost the princely sum of \u00a34 per night.\n\nIn the evenings we\u2019d stroll along Serendipity Beach, eating at one of the beachside shacks, many of which specialised in \u201cHappy Pizza\u201d (very, er, generous toppings) and very cheap beer. As one idyllic sunset led to another, I\u2019d extend my stay by the day, and arranged equally cheap day trips to Ream and Bokor national parks and a lovely, uninhabited island known as \u201cBamboo Island\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAlas, as one of the first stops on China\u2019s new Belt and Road Initiative, that experience is all but gone. Cambodia\u2019s government, led by prime minister Hun Sen, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sees limited value in dreadlocked backpackers and dope-fuelled slow tourism and has opened much of the country\u2019s southern coast to Chinese development on a massive scale, with land concessions being offered in return for infrastructural investment.\n\nSihanoukville is now home to several bland new special economic zones and increasingly outrageous projects, one of the latest of which is Wisney World, a $1bn 65-hectare project set to feature \u201cwater parks, hotels, casinos, malls, gardens and churches\u201d, according to the Phnom Penh Post. National parks are becoming home to monstrous resorts and casinos. The interior of Ream National Park has suffered a massive land clearance. The roads are mostly still a mess \u2013 dusty and potholed \u2013 but a four-lane highway is currently being constructed between Sihanoukville, home to Cambodia\u2019s only deepwater port, and the capital Phnom Penh.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In the moonlit night, I could see the new Sihanoukville skyline. Various Vegas-style multi-storey blocks glowed garishly in the night, and there is much more under construction as developers push to service the overfed, swaggering arrivals at Sihanoukville International Airport.\n\nAll along the road to Kampot further north are construction sites for garish new shopping malls, but most upsetting was seeing the scar in the middle of Ream National Park, where I had previously landed on a long-tail boat to observe endangered species such as sun bears, fishing cats, sea eagles and river dolphins. Now, one local tour operator says he no longer bothers sending people there, as diggers have destroyed pathways and vegetation and wildlife has retreated. A similar thing is happening in Botum Sakor National Park.\n\nThat said, there is still some life left on the Cambodian Riviera. Here\u2019s where to go.\n\nOn the mainland\n\nTravellers with an interest in ecotourism, slow travel, local culture, nature and supporting small local businesses can check into the Green House, a beautifully scenic boutique-style riverside restaurant and guesthouse near Kampot. Bungalows cost from $20 a night and the French-style restaurant features dishes such as locally produced burrata with mango, honey and black pepper and grilled barracuda \u2013 both $9 each - and a dreamy river view. Fresh fruit juices are $2.\n\nMuch of the old port town of Kampot, known for its pepper, is disappointingly nondescript, but some old Chinese-style shophouses and colonial French buildings remain, and the riverfront is worth looking at for its lined-up fishing boats. The old market is also gloriously unmodernised: seafood is fished and gutted to order, while piles of chickens and ducks are presented next to their freshly severed heads. There\u2019s an honesty to this connection with food that even vegetarians can admire; go before it\u2019s sanitised.\n\nKnai Bang Chatt, in still relatively untouched and charming Kep, which has a genteel waterfront lined with food vendors, small restaurants and calm water for swimming, also has fabulous views over the Gulf of Thailand and wins with its over-water restaurant The Sailing Club. Go for the prawn and pomelo salad ($8) and a beer.\n\nCommunity tourism in the Cardamom Mountains\n\nSupport local tourism that isn\u2019t destroying the environment by patronising businesses such as Chi Phat, 10 miles north by boat from Andong Teuk. Rustic accommodation and a variety of nature-based activities, including volunteering, are on offer.\n\nIn the Koh Rong archipelago\n\nThe largest island of Koh Rong still sustains a healthy backpacker population, though a number of slick, expensive boutique hotels and larger resorts have opened in recent years and bigger projects are in the pipeline. There has been some local opposition to these, but visit now before it\u2019s ruined.\n\nWith the smaller island resorts such as Song Saa and Six Senses, you\u2019ll pay top dollar for seclusion and barefoot luxury.\n\nAmong the best is the new Alila, which offers beautiful designer villas from $400 per night on Bamboo Island, well out of view of Sihanoukville and big enough to stay on for a week. The island has retained its dense forest, villas are one and two storeys only and well set back from the shoreline, and the beach has been deep cleaned.\n\nI had been worried about going back to Bamboo Island, but the water is still clear and as I swim out to sea and look back at the crescent of sand backed by jungle, it looks just like it did when I came here on a $10 day trip involving only sun, sea and barbecued barracuda on the beach.", "description": "Ten years ago, the Cambodian coast was referred to as \u201cThailand without the crowds\u201d, its laid-back beaches providing a welcome budget break for backpackers travelling between Thailand and Vietnam.", "authors": ["Rosemary Behan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/20/10/istock-511720300.jpg"}
