(Reuters) - Sky Brown, the 11-year-old skateboarding prodigy who is poised to become Britain\u2019s youngest ever Olympian at the 2020 Tokyo Games, has already amassed an enviable resume.\n\nEleven-year-old skateboarder Sky Brown trains to become Britain's youngest summer Olympian at a skatepark in Huntington Beach, California, U.S., September 20, 2019. REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nPro skater, surfing phenom, Dancing with the Stars juniors champion and determined philanthropist, Brown is transforming ideas about what the next generation is capable of.\n\nAt a sun-soaked skatepark in Southern California last week she took on a new role - director.\n\nStanding at the edge of a vertigo-inducing bowl, Brown guided two veteran camera people on where best to position themselves to capture her tricks.\n\nBrown, who was born in Japan to a British father and Japanese mother, took a big step towards making Team GB\u2019s Olympic squad with a third-place finish at the World Championships in Brazil this month.\n\nIf she qualifies, Brown will be 12 years and 12 days old when the Games begin in July, eclipsing the record set by swimmer Margery Hinton, who was 13 years and 43 days when she competed at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam.\n\nBrown\u2019s parents Stu and Mieko initially thought the pressure of competing in Tokyo, where skateboarding will be making it Olympic debut, would be too much for her.\n\nBut Brown said they had a change of heart after speaking to Skateboard GB chair Lucy Adams.\n\n\u201cShe said there is no pressure, just get out there and have fun,\u201d Brown told Reuters.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the way I skate. I don\u2019t really think of it as a training thing. I think of it more as my happy place. It\u2019s like a playground for me.\u201d\n\nELEVATING WOMEN\n\nBrown is passionate about making sure that playground, which has historically been the domain of men and boys, is open to everyone.\n\n\u201cSometimes girls are scared to do what boys are doing because they\u2019re like, it\u2019s a boy\u2019s sport. But actually they can do anything that boys can do,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhy I want to be in the Olympics is to inspire girls and hopefully when they see me, this little girl doing these crazy tricks, hopefully when they see me they\u2019ll think, maybe I can do that too.\u201d\n\nBrown has forged a bond with other up-and-coming female skateboarders like Japan\u2019s Sakura Yosozumi, 17, who practised alongside her days after claiming a silver medal at the World Championships.\n\n\u201cI think we met when I was like, five? We\u2019ve known each other for a pretty long time and since then we\u2019ve been pretty tight,\u201d Brown said.\n\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s right now second in the world, which is amazing,\u201d she said while seated next to Yosozumi.\n\nYosozumi said the two girls are capable of embracing their friendship while still relishing their battles.\n\n\u201cOutside the competition we get along very well but inside the competition we like to compete. It\u2019s very nice,\u201d Yosozumi said.\n\nFIGHTING POVERTY\n\nSkateboarding great and Brown\u2019s mentor Christian Hosoi said that beyond an abundance of natural talent, her passion for helping others is what makes her unique.\n\nBrown has travelled to Cambodia with Skateistan, a non-profit organisation that promotes education and teaches skateboarding in impoverished areas.\n\nA trip to Skateistan\u2019s school in Afghanistan is now in the works.\n\n\u201cWhat sets her apart is her wanting to help people and girls,\u201d said the 51-year-old Hosoi.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an amazing skateboarder, dancer, she\u2019s got a million dollar smile ... but her philanthropy and what she does to help girls around the world is incredible.\n\n\u201cI love to hear her messages and that\u2019s what I love about Sky. She wants to change the world.\u201d\n\nBrown, who lives in the Japanese coastal city of Miyazaki and spends time in Southern California, said she has witnessed poverty first hand and those experiences instilled a feeling of empathy.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I saw that I was like, I want to do something because I could easily be there,\u201d she said. \u201cI just got lucky.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nTo help fund Skateistan, Brown, who counts Almost Skateboards and Nike (NKE.N) among her growing list of sponsors, designed a board adorned with a peaceful dove.\n\nTen dollars from each sale goes to support the kids in the programme and they have raised $20,000, an amount Brown called \u201ccrazy\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne of my dreams is to teach kids, especially in underprivileged countries, how to skate because I feel like when they skate, they forget about what they are struggling through,\u201d she said.", "description": "Sky Brown, the 11-year-old skateboarding prodigy who is poised to become Britain's youngest ever Olympian at the 2020 Tokyo Games, has already amassed an enviable resume.", "authors": ["Rory Carroll", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433925338&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O288", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
