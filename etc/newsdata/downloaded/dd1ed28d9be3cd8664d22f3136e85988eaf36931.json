But we hung in until the end and had the chance to win it.\n\n'To lose that game 9-8 was pretty disappointing, but it showed what this team is all about. They never give up, they never throw the towel in.\n\n'That is the great character we've developed over a number of years with all we have achieved.'\n\nWales came so close to the World Cup final - and now they are set to face Les Bleus once more\n\nGatland says Wales are in an excellent position, with everyone fit and raring to go on Sunday\n\nAsked if it was a case of unfinished World Cup business with France, Gatland added: 'Not really. To be involved in 2011 was pretty special, but it was disappointing not to get to the final.\n\n'In 2015 we were leading South Africa in the quarter-final but conceded a try in the last five minutes.\n\n'We lost about five players (injured) in that game, so I don't know what sort of team we could have put out in the semi-final against New Zealand.\n\n'That whole 2015 experience has reflected in our planning and preparation, creating depth in the squad and some competition. We felt like we've done that.\n\n'Going into the (2019) quarter-final knowing you've got 31 players fit and training puts us in a pretty healthy position.\n\n'It's not about unfinished business, it's about taking our opportunities.\n\n'From a coaching and playing perspective, these opportunities can change people's lives. I know the players will give it everything.'\n\nWales are into the World Cup quarter-finals and will come up against France again on Sunday\n\nGeorge North is among a group of players on the recovery trail and expected to be back fit\n\nWales have beaten France seven times from eight attempts since that semi-final loss, including an unlikely Six Nations victory last season when Les Bleus led 16-0 at half-time.\n\nThe Wales squad arrived at their quarter-final base north of Beppu on Monday.\n\nGatland hopes to have a fully-fit squad available, including centre Jonathan Davies, fly-half Dan Biggar and wing George North, who are all on the recovery trail after suffering knocks.\n\nFrance scrum-half Baptiste Serin said: 'Everyone thinks about it (last season's Six Nations loss). When you have a first half like that and end up losing, it leaves its mark.\n\n'We will make use of the experience, look at what went well and work on what didn't.\n\n'But we are not going to focus on that match.\n\n'There is a big gap between the Six Nations and the quarter-final of the World Cup. We are going to work on what the Welsh did in their recent games.'", "description": "Wales face Les Bleus in a last-eight clash next Sunday, inevitably evoking memories of events at Eden Park, Auckland eight years ago.
