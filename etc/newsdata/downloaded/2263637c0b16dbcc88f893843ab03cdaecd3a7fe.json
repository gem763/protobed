Trump Hotels, understandably, tops the list, but then, as you can see, the next 10 are all media companies, led by CNN and Fox News:\n\nThe 2018 version of the chart delivered similar results, but the political polarization has clearly become more pronounced since then.\n\nTake CNN, for example. Last year, the difference between net favorability among Republicans and Democrats for the network stood at 66 percentage points. Now, that number is up to 80, due to a 12-point drop among conservatives, who held more negative views than the left of every media outlet except Fox News.\n\n\u201cIn a way, it\u2019s really corroboration of the narrative in the industry right now,\u201d GroupM\u2019s Joe Barone was cited by Morning Consult as saying in the survey. \u201cThe narrative is that we\u2019re living in a polarized world, and media is both contributing to the polarization and reflective of the polarization.\u201d\n\nRead: After checking out this chart, let\u2019s agree to disagree\n\nThere\u2019s upside to the divide for the media, of course. Viewership for CNN, Fox News and MSNBC all jumped in 2018, Pew reported. And the New York Times NYT, -0.35% , fourth on the list, posted record print and digital subscriptions.\n\nAside from Trump Hotels, the only other non-media brands on the list are Smith & Wesson AOBC, -1.71% , favored by Republicans, and Nike NKE, -1.75% , a favorite of Democrats.", "description": "The United States in 2019: You\u2019re either with me or against me.
