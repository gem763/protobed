He added the caveat that a no-deal Brexit may make this impossible.\n\nThe falls in the euro and sterling this week has driven the dollar index to its highest in three weeks. At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), it was at 98.917, down a shade from an overnight high of 98.958.\n\nThe euro fell as low as $1.0905 overnight during Asian hours and is now down 4.6% against the dollar year-to-date, the worst performing of all major currencies. By 3:45 AM, it was at $1.0922, little changed from late Thursday levels.\n\nAnalysts at Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen said in a note Friday that if the recent double-bottom formation at $1.0925 is convincingly broken, then the euro could settle into a trading range between $1.0870-$1.0970.\n\nFresh data Friday morning underlined the continuing disinflationary pressure coming from the depreciation of the yuan and from falling oil prices. German import prices, an advance indicator of broader inflationary trends, fell 0.6% in August, much more than the 0.3% forecast, taking the year-on-year drop to 2.7% from 2.1% in July. French consumer inflation data also came in below expectations.\n\nThe numbers come barely a day after Sabine Lautenschlaeger resigned her board position at the European Central Bank, a move that some said was motivated by opposition to President Mario Draghi\u2019s decision to restart quantitative easing in November. Lautenschlaeger herself hasn\u2019t been that explicit about the reasons for her departure. In addition, the ECB\u2019s chief economist Philip Lane hinted that the bank still has space for further monetary easing when its new President Christine Lagarde takes over in November.", "description": "Forex - Euro Hovers Above 2019 Lows; Pound Falls as BoE Hawk Softens", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6K0IO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
