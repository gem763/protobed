There are a slew of experts with every piece of information imaginable, but they still are unable to predict with great certainty when and where the hurricane will hit. Even just a couple days in advance there is no great certainty how things will unfold.\n\nThere are a slew of experts currently predicting an economic hurricane as well. Many of them claim to know exactly how events will develop, but it is unlikely any of them will be correct about the timing, intensity or manner of an economic correction. Not only will the experts be incorrect about the economy, but they also will be wrong about the impact on the stock market as well.\n\nOur goal as investors and traders isn't to predict what is going to happen but to navigate events as they unfold. The stock market is at a significant juncture as we enter the historically weak month of September, but is it prudent to act like we are in the eye of an economic and stock market hurricane? Is disaster inevitable?\n\nThere have been a few times in the last decade that the level of bearish conviction has been as high as it is right now. Predictions of an economic recession continues to build, the uncertainty related to trade is causing a high level of volatility, and interest rates are falling to historic lows as growth fears take hold.\n\nThe bearish narrative has seldom been as easy to articulate as it is right now. The arguments are obvious and compelling.\n\nThe problem is that obviousness is often a trap. When everyone sees something and acts on it, then the likelihood of it occurring is diminished. The bearish argument is nearly perfect and now there is the seasonal negativity of September to make it even more obvious.\n\nThis high level of negativity is pushing some market strategists to take a contrary view. J.P. Morgan issued a positive view of the market on Monday. That strategist believes there is a \"wild card\" related to tariff negotiations, but technical indicators and monetary easing outweigh the trade risk.\n\nThe bullish argument holds appeal in view of the high level of bearish conviction that exists, but the best course of action isn't to try to predict what will happen but to react as events unfold. It is possible the bears build further traction, but the chances of a bear trap are high.\n\nWhen dealing with a hurricane we must be prepared to deal with the worse, but we also must be aware there is a good chance the predictions will be wrong and that we will needlessly cost ourselves time and money if we are inflexible in our preparations.\n\nMany are certain the economic hurricane is going to hit the market hard in September, but as we've learned from Hurricane Dorian and its many predecessors it is extremely difficult to predict how disaster may unfold.\n\nMy game plan continues to be a high level of cash, a few select stock picks, and some index shorts. I'll be closing out some of those index shorts into the open here on Tuesday morning.", "description": "Economic forecasting is even more difficult than forecasting hurricanes such as Hurricane Dorian; the goal of investors and traders isn't to predict what is going to happen but to navigate events as they unfold.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Economic Forecasting Is Even More Difficult Than Forecasting Hurricanes", "Our Goal As Investors", "Traders Isn'T To Predict What Is Going To Happen But To Navigate Events As They Unfold.", "Kevin Curran", "Bruce Kamich", "Timothy Collins", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/b6af13b4-ccd8-11e9-848d-ffe9b9924135.jpg"}
