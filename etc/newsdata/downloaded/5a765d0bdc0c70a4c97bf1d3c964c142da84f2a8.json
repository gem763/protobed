Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Democratic presidential candidates debate in Westerville, Ohio, October 15, 2019. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nThe CNN and New York Times journalists who moderated Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic-primary debate didn\u2019t ask a single question about China during the foreign-policy segment of the evening, despite the ongoing scandal involving the NBA\u2019s response to Chinese censorship.\n\nThe topic of China came up just once during the debate, when South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg criticized President Trump for failing to express solidarity with Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters as China tries to tighten its control over the city.\n\nInstead, the foreign-policy questions focused mostly on Trump\u2019s handling of the American withdrawal from Syria, as well as his relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have criticized Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops from the Syrian-Turkish border in advance of Turkey\u2019s invasion of northeast Syria, saying it constitutes an abandonment of Kurdish allies that were instrumental in the fight against ISIS.\n\nThe NBA has been embroiled in controversy since Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted on October 4, \u201cFight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d The Chinese Basketball Association immediately cut all ties with the Rockets, and Rockets merchandise was removed from Nike stores in major Chinese cities.\n\nMorey deleted his tweet and apologized to Chinese fans. The NBA was widely pilloried by U.S. elected officials for kowtowing to China after issuing an apologetic statement calling Morey\u2019s remarks \u201cinappropriate.\u201d In the latest development, Los Angeles Lakers star Lebron James criticized Morey for sending the tweet, saying Morey was not \u201ceducated\u201d about the situation in Hong Kong.", "description": "Instead, questions focused mostly on Trump's handling of Syria, as well as his relationship with Vladimir Putin.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
