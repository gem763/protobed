The company has taken other steps to increasing shareholder returns,\" Gammel said in a note.\n\n\n\n\n\n(GRAPHIC: BP Q3 profits - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/7111/7093/Pasted%20Image.jpg )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Ron Bousso, editing by Louise Heavens)", "description": "Its shares, however, sank 3.8% after Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary indicated in an analyst call that the company could delay a decision on boosting dividends to next year.
