Marcus Rashford (new entry)\n\nPOWER RANKINGS Throughout the 2019-20 season, each week Sportsmail will bring you a Power Rankings table, listing the top 10 hottest players in the Premier League. As the stories of the season unravel, the rankings will provide a form guide with players moving in and out of the top 10 depending on both their performances in the previous week and also in recent weeks.\n\nIt's amazing what a week in different surroundings can do for someone and Marcus Rashford definitely benefited from a change of scenery.\n\nThe 21-year-old looked fatigue and sluggish in recent weeks, but returned to Manchester United rejuvenated after impressing for England over the international break.\n\nRashford barely stopped running and was a constant threat to Liverpool on the break at the weekend. He capped off a quick counter-attacking move by turning in Daniel James' pinpoint cross in the first half and was overall United's standout performer. He deservedly breaks into our top 10 this week.\n\nMarcus Rashford breaks into the top 10 after scoring in Man United's 1-1 draw with Liverpool\n\n9. Jack Grealish (new entry)\n\nJack Grealish seems to be getting better and better as each week passes.\n\nHe had been waiting on the cusp after scoring in Aston Villa's thumping win over Norwich last time out and followed that performance up with another eye-catching display.\n\nThe midfielder scored the opener and set up Matthew Targett for a late winner against Brighton at the weekend as Villa grabbed a valuable three points. He slots in at No 9, replacing his team-mate Wesley.\n\nJack Grealish put in a man-of-the-match performance as Aston Villa beat Brighton on Saturday\n\n8. James Maddison (down one)\n\nIt is not surprising anymore that James Maddison is being eyed by some of the best teams in Europe.\n\nThe midfielder has been one of the most consistent performers this season and is one of the key reasons behind Leicester's superb start.\n\nNo goals or assists this week, though he did come close on several occasions to finding the back of the net against Burnley, sees Maddison drop down one place into eighth.\n\nJames Maddison helped Leicester beat Burnley, but could't score or register assist in the game\n\nLAST WEEK'S POWER RANKINGS 10. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang 9. Wesley 8. Willy Boly 7. James Maddison 6. Sergio Aguero 5. Raheem Sterling 4. Callum Wilson 3. Kevin De Bruyne 2. Tammy Abraham 1. Sadio Mane\n\n7. Youri Tielemans (new entry)\n\nHad VAR not chalked off a Burnley equaliser, Youri Tielemans would likely have not found himself this high in our rankings.\n\nThe Belgian, for the majority of the match, completely controlled the midfield, but almost cost his side three points when he was pinched of possession and Chris Wood was sent through to bundle home.\n\nFortunately for him, VAR ruled it out. Aside from that hiccup, Tielemans was brilliant, effortlessly gliding past players and setting up attacks for his side almost at will. He also showed a composed head to strike the winner for Leicester.\n\nYouri Tielemans showed a composed head to thump in the winning goal on the weekend\n\n6. Callum Wilson (down two)\n\nBournemouth vs Norwich, we all thought had goals written all over it. How wrong we were.\n\nCallum Wilson would have been licking his lips when the Premier League's worst defence came to town, but he was largely limited to half chances.\n\nThe Bournemouth striker drops down another two places after failing to find the back of the net for successive games and will face a battle to stay in next week unless he can get back to scoring ways.\n\nCallum Wilson forgot his shooting boots on the weekend as he drew a blank against Norwich\n\n5. Marcos Alonso (new entry)\n\nThe Spaniard appears to have rediscovered his best form.\n\nIt seemed as if Marcos Alonso was going to get used to playing second fiddle to Emerson Palmieri this season under Frank Lampard but has recently shown his worth.\n\nHe was solid in defence and proved to be the unlikely hero on the weekend, driving in a late winner for Chelsea against Newcastle. A clean sheet and a goal, can't ask for much more than that from your full-back.\n\nMarcos Alonso helped Chelsea keep a clean sheet and scored the winner against Newcastle\n\n4. Raheem Sterling (up one)\n\nRaheem Sterling moves up one place this week after helping Manchester City return to winning ways at Crystal Palace.\n\nThe England forward's general play was good and he provided a delicious, deft chip for David Silva to lash through Wayne Hennessey's leg for City's second.\n\nAston Villa up next for City. Sterling will fancy his chances of moving up the rankings again this weekend.\n\nRaheem Sterling had a quiet game but showed his class with a lovely assist for David Silva\n\n3. Tammy Abraham (down one)\n\nTammy Abraham has been lethal in front of goal this season but drew a blank on Saturday.\n\nThe striker would have had high hopes of adding to his tally but couldn't find a way through the Newcastle defence.\n\nIt's cost him his place at No 2 as he drops down our list after failing to find the net.\n\nTammy Abraham has been on a terrific run of goalscoring form but couldn't add to his tally\n\n2. Kevin De Bruyne (up one)\n\nCity may have managed without Kevin De Bruyne for the majority of last season, but there can be no disputing that they are a much better team when he is playing.\n\nAlready this season, the Belgian has registered eight assists and two goals in the Premier League.\n\nHe pulled the strings from midfield against Palace on the weekend and nearly got on the scoresheet, but his header bounced back out off the post. He moves up one behind our top spot.\n\nKevin De Bruyne pulled the strings from midfield and helped City to ease past Crystal Palace\n\n1. Sadio Mane (no change)\n\nOn another week, Sadio Mane probably wouldn't find himself still in top spot.\n\nBut, after none of the chasing pack set the world alight this weekend, the Liverpool man has managed to clutch on to No 1.\n\nThe forward was decent at Old Trafford, but couldn't impact the game. He did have the ball in the back of the net, but VAR ruled it out for handball to the dismay of Jurgen Klopp. He will need a better performance next time out if he is to consolidate his place at the top of the pile.", "description": "Each week throughout the 2019-20 season, Sportsmail will bring you a Power Rankings table, listing the top 10 hottest players in the Premier League.
