REUTERS/Omar Sobhani\n\nGhani\u2019s comments, to a meeting of military leaders in Kabul, came amid uncertainty over the future of efforts to end 18 years of war in Afghanistan after U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt cancellation of talks with the Taliban at the weekend.\n\n\u201cWe are ready for peace talks but if the Taliban think they can scare us, look at these warriors,\u201d Ghani said, declaring that peace could not be unconditional as he repeated demands for a ceasefire that the Taliban have so far refused.\n\n\u201cPeace without a ceasefire is impossible.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s refusal to meet the Taliban has left it unclear whether talks can be revived or whether the two sides, locked in a broad stalemate, will continue fighting.\n\nThe insurgents\u2019 determination to step up both attacks on provincial centres and suicide bombings even as peace talks were taking place was a key factor in pushing Trump to cancel talks days after a U.S. soldier was killed in the capital Kabul.\n\nThe end of the talks has fuelled fears of a further increase in violence across Afghanistan, with heightened security warnings in the Kabul and other centres ahead of a presidential election scheduled for Sept. 28.\n\nThe talks, which had been secret until Trump unexpectedly announced their cancellation on Saturday, would have brought the U.S. president face-to-face with senior Taliban leaders at the presidential compound in Camp David, Maryland.\n\nWITHDRAWAL TIMETABLE\n\nGhani, who was sidelined from months of negotiations between U.S. officials and Taliban representatives, had been deeply suspicious of the talks, which sought to agree a timetable for a withdrawal of thousands of U.S. troops.\n\nA draft accord agreed last week would have seen some 5,000 U.S. troops withdrawn over coming months in exchange for guarantees that Afghanistan would not be used as a base for militant attacks on the United States or its allies.\n\nAfghan officials had argued for months that it was a mistake for the United States to agree a deal on troop withdrawals separately from a broader peace accord.\n\nThe collapse of the talks appears to have strengthened Ghani\u2019s position, in part by removing lingering doubts over whether the twice-delayed election - in which he is favourite to win a second five-year term - would go ahead.\n\nUntil Saturday\u2019s surprise announcement by Trump, many politicians and Western diplomats had argued that peace talks should take priority over an election seen as a potential obstacle to a deal with the Taliban.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nNow officials say there is no excuse for the vote not to be held, with election authorities promising that the problems that dogged parliamentary elections last year will not be repeated.\n\nGhani, a former World Bank official who came to power after a bitterly disputed election in 2014, has kept up campaigning even as the talks went on, adapting to the worsening security situation by holding \u201cvirtual rallies\u201d that address supporters in various provinces through a video link-up.\n\n\u201cAfghanistan is now at a critical juncture because of the election and the peace process,\u201d he said.", "description": "Afghan President Ashraf Ghani made a renewed call for peace on Monday but insisted the Taliban must observe a ceasefire, as he sought to regain a hold on the peace process following the surprise collapse of talks between the United States and the militants.", "authors": ["Hamid Shalizi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428013306&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881G9", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
