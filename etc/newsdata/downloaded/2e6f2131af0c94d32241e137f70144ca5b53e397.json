There was a great deal of preparatory work that was done before the call. There was a lot of follow-up work done after the call,\" he said.\n\n- Ukraine pressure like a 'drug deal' -\n\nSchiff spoke a day after former White House Russia expert Fiona Hill reportedly told Congressional investigators in closed-door testimony that several high-level aides reported the Trump-Zelinsky phone call to a White House lawyer as possible wrongdoing by the president.\n\nHill said her own boss, then-national security advisor John Bolton, characterized Trump's pressure on Zelensky together with Giuliani and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as akin to a narcotics transaction.\n\n\"I am not part of whatever drug deal Rudy and Mulvaney are cooking up,\" Bolton said, according to Hill's testimony as reported by the New York Times.\n\nHill said Bolton also warned that Giuliani, who is reportedly under federal investigation over his Ukraine dealings, is \"a hand grenade who's going to blow everyone up.\"\n\n- Out of the loop -\n\nHouse Democrats on Tuesday interviewed a top State Department official responsible for Ukraine, George Kent, about his role between the White House, Giuliani and Kiev, and prepared to question three more diplomats this week.\n\nKent told lawmakers that Mulvaney arranged for him to be cut out of decision making on Ukraine in favor of three officials close to Trump, The Washington Post reported, particularly his energy secretary, ambassador to the European Union and special envoy to Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile on Twitter, Trump lashed out at lawmakers, saying \"Democrats are allowing no transparency at the Witch Hunt hearings.\"\n\nDemocrats are seeking to prove Trump sought foreign aid to boost his reelection next year, violating US election laws.\n\nTrump has admitted asking Zelensky for help to investigate Biden, but said it was for legitimate suspicions of corruption and not political reasons.\n\nThe White House meanwhile Tuesday questioned the investigation's legitimacy by refusing to turn over budget office, Pentagon and vice presidential documents related to the Ukraine dealings.\n\nAnd Giuliani brushed off a subpoena, branding the inquiry \"illegitimate\" and \"unconstitutional,\" as he risked being declared in contempt of Congress.\n\n- Schiff: White House 'stonewalling' -\n\nSchiff accused the White House of stonewalling the investigation and said that could be added to impeachment charges.\n\n\"The case for obstruction of Congress continues to build,\" he said.\n\nSchiff said the committees involved in the inquiry would continue to collect evidence in private depositions, but were prepared to release the testimony once it was all complete.\n\nDemocrats involved in the process suggested that articles of impeachment could come by the end of the year.\n\nDemocratic congressman Eric Swalwell told CNN Hill's deposition had bolstered the argument for removing Trump, and said his party would be swift and \"surgical\" in building the case.\n\n\"Every arrow continues to point in the same direction,\" he said.\n\n\"We already have a motive, we have a crime, we have a confession and we have evidence,\" Democrat Mark Pocan told Wisconsin Public Radio.", "description": "The leader of the impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump said Tuesday that witnesses had provided substantial support for allegations that Trump illegally tried to force Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.
