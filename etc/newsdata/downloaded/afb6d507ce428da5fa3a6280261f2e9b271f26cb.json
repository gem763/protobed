So Apple Removed It.", "language": "en", "text": "Apple has removed an app from its Hong Kong app store that residents used to help avoid tear gas hours, after Chinese officials criticized the company.\n\nThe company claimed it made the decision to remove the HKMap.live app on Thursday because it was being used to \u201ctarget and ambush police.\u201d But the makers of the app say there is \u201czero evidence\u201d to back up this claim, and that the app was primarily used by residents to stay safe and avoid tear gas.\n\nThe decision to remove the app puts Apple on a growing list of U.S. companies, including the NBA, Blizzard and Tiffany, that have kowtowed to Chinese pressure over Hong Kong in order to avoid sanctions from Beijing.\n\nHKMap.live crowdsourced the location of police and anti-government protesters. It was initially rejected by Apple but the company reversed that decision on Oct. 4, with the app going live on the App Store a day later.\n\nThe app, which was available in the Hong Kong version of the App Store but not the Chinese version, quickly became Hong Kong\u2019s most downloaded app in the travel category.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece the People\u2019s Daily hit out at Apple in a piece titled: \u201cProtecting rioters \u2013 Has Apple thought clearly about this?\u201d\n\n\u201cAllowing the \u2018poisonous\u2019 app to flourish is a betrayal of the Chinese people\u2019s feelings [and allowed] Hong Kong rioters to openly commit crime while openly escaping arrests,\u201d the editorial said, without naming the app specifically.\n\nWithin hours, Apple responded.\n\n\u201cWe have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app [HKmap.Live] has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement. This app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store,\u201d the company said in a statement to VICE News.\n\nREAD: An NBA fan was ejected from a game in Philly for yelling 'free Hong Kong'\n\nThe makers of the app, who have remained anonymous to protect themselves, slammed Apple for its decision, saying there is \u201czero evidence\u201d to back up the claims by the Hong Kong authorities that the app was used \u201cto target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement.\u201d\n\nThe developers pointed out that moderators deleted any user-generated content that solicited, promoted, or encouraged criminal activity and that repeat offenders were banned from the platform. The HKMap.live website remains accessible on iPhones.\n\nREAD: One tweet from the Rockets\u2019 GM proved just how desperate the NBA is for China\u2019s money\n\n\u201cWe once believed the app rejection is simply a bureaucratic f-up, but now it is clearly a political decision to suppress freedom and human right in #HongKong,\u201d the developers tweeted.\n\nBut the removal of the HKMap.live app isn\u2019t the only action Apple has taken at the request of the Chinese government this week.\n\nThe company also removed the Quartz app from its Chinese app store and deleted the Taiwan flag emoji from iPhone keyboards for Hong Kong users in its latest software update.\n\nCritics claim companies like Apple are simply bowing to Chinese pressure because they are worried about the possible loss of revenue caused by angering Beijing.\n\nREAD: Blizzard's Hong Kong screw-up is officially an international incident\n\nThe NBA has distanced itself from the tweet sent by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey showing support of the protests after Chinese authorities reacted angrily. Games studio Blizzard banned a Hong Kong-based player of its popular game Hearthstone game after he said: \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u201d in a live-streamed interview. And Tiffany removed a tweet showing a model covering one eye, thought to be a gesture of solidarity with Hong Kong demonstrators.\n\n\u201cHistory will remember all this groveling to authoritarians,\u201d Zeynep Tufekci, a writer who is chronicling the protests in Hong Kong, said on Thursday.\n\nCover: Supporters of Hong Kong activist Edward Leung gather outside the High Court in Hong Kong, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2019.
