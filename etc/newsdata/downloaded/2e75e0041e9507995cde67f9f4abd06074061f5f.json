He was doing well in the fight until the final seconds of Round 1, when he was dropped. \u201cThe Last Stylebender\u201d came on in the second and found his opening to finish the fight.\n\nLosing the title is an obvious setback for Whittaker, but he\u2019s keeping his head held high. To him, he was simply caught on the wrong end of the game of inches that is MMA.\n\n\u201cObviously I\u2019m disappointed, but I took the fight to him,\u201d Whittaker told reporters, including MMA Junkie, post-fight at UFC 243. \u201cMe and him are two of the best strikers in the world, and it was tit for tat, and I got caught. It happens. He beat me tonight, but I\u2019m 28. This is my first loss in the division and trust me when I say I\u2019m not going anywhere.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t in awe of his striking, and I was confident in my own, and I was having great success. I need to work on that check-hook defense. We went out there and put our hearts on it, and it happens. We\u2019re two of the best strikers in the world together, and that\u2019s what happens. Someone is going to get caught, and unfortunately tonight it was me.\u201d\n\nPrior to UFC 243, Whittaker hadn\u2019t lost since February 2014. He clearly took confidence from the fact the fight was competitive and still believes he can get the better of Adesanya.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see on another night, let\u2019s go at it again,\u201d Whittaker said. \u201cI think I can do that. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so disappointing, I guess. I feel like I can beat him. I feel like I have the skillset to beat him. But we clashed heads, and I came off second best. I got caught. Hats off to him. He\u2019s a great striker and congratulations. But like I said: I\u2019m not going nowhere. I\u2019m still one of the best in the world. I\u2019ve always claimed that title. I\u2019m one of the best in the world. I got the title once.\u201d\n\nWith Paulo Costa lined up as the No. 1 contender at 185 pounds, it\u2019s likely Whittaker will have to win at least one fight before he\u2019s competing for a belt again. Whittaker expressed relief that he came out of the octagon unscathed outside of the knockout and said he will be thinking about his next fight not long after returning home to Sydney.\n\n\u201cThank God I\u2019m not injured,\u201d Whittaker said. \u201cI took the knockout, but I\u2019m healthy. I\u2019m just going to come home and see my family, get training, I\u2019m going to do my podcast, and I\u2019m coming back to work in a couple months.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the market. I\u2019m here to fight. I\u2019m back to work, and I felt great out there. This is the best I\u2019ve ever been. Honest to God, this is the best I\u2019ve ever been. I just got caught, and that\u2019s what happens.\u201d", "description": "Robert Whittaker is in positive spirits despite losing the middleweight title to Israel Adesanya at UFC 243.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Ken Hathaway", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Blue Corner", "Dave Doyle", "Mmajunkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/robert-whittaker-ufc-243-post-fight.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
