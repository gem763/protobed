Overall, those two holes just destroyed my day.\u201d\n\nIn third on his own, three shots behind the leaders is Australia\u2019s Cameron Smith who had a 68 to reach 12-under for the tournament.\n\nA shot further back are former world number one Jordan Spieth who battled to a two-under 70 after bogeying his two opening holes, and young American Wyndham Clark who carded a fine 67.\n\nBefore the third round started world number one and defending champion Brooks Koepka withdrew with a recurrence of a long-standing knee injury.\n\nThe American had struggled to a three over 75 Friday and was already out of contention.\n\nThe lowest score of the day was shared by young star Collin Morikawa and US Open champions Gary Woodland, who both carded fine seven-under par 65s.", "description": "Jeju (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 Justin Thomas saw a three-stroke advantage disappear in a crazy final-hole swing Saturday as Danny Lee grabbed a share of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/83defe_justin-thomas-us-hits-his-shot-on-ninth-hole-cj-cup-thomas-blows-stroke-cj-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
