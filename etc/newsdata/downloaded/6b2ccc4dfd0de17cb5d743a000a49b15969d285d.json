Midfielders Mason Mount and Ross Barkley are also in Gareth Southgate's 25.\n\nThe call-up is reward for a fine start to the season for both Abraham and Tomori and speaking ahead of Sunday's clash with Southampton, Lampard revealed they had 'big smiles on their faces' at training.\n\nFrank Lampard has urged Abraham and Tomori to up their game after their England call-ups\n\nLampard congratulates centre-back Tomori after beating Lille in the Champions League\n\nThe Chelsea boss shakes hands with Abraham, who scored the first goal of the game\n\nBut the Chelsea boss warned them: 'It is great news for them, but as I keep saying that it is just the start. The minute any standards drop or complacency kicks in then they will all suffer. I am pleased they smile, they need to take this now, something to add to their armoury and say, 'Okay I am an England player, I am in the England squad.

I want to see him continue in the same vein for Chelsea and to keep scoring goals.\n\n'Naturally when he goes to the England squad he has the attributes to go there and be successful.
