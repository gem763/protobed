We are surprised by the Proposed Decision that we received this morning. Whilst our legal counsels are now studying the Proposed Decision, we believe that it is common practice for businesses to decide upon the availability and type of third-party advertising on their respective platforms, tailored according to consumers\u2019 needs and feedback.\"\n\nThe company said it will be submitting a \"written representation\" to MyCC by November 27.\n\nIskandar said Grab has 30 working days to make its representations to the commission before a final decision will be made.\n\nThe regulator said last year it would monitor Grab for possible anti-competitive behaviour after its acquisition of rival Uber Technologies Inc's Southeast Asian business in March 2018.\n\nMalaysia would be the third country in the region to penalise Grab after the deal with Uber.\n\nLast year, both firms were fined by anti-trust watchdogs in Singapore and the Philippines for their merger. Singapore said the deal had driven up prices, while the Philippines criticised the firms for completing the merger too soon and for a dip in quality of service.\n\nHowever, Iskandar said the Malaysian regulator's investigations were based on complaints received against the ride-hailing firm, and not due to its near monopoly of the market after the Uber deal.\n\nUnder Malaysia's Competition Act, a monopoly or dominant player in the market is not an infringement of the law, unless it abuses its position in the market.\n\n\"MyCC does not have mergers powers. We cannot unscramble the egg,\" Iskandar said.", "description": "Malaysian regulator says Grab 'created barriers to entry' against competitors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/3/a29c078d8bcc428da009c4b20f3b9f63_18.jpg"}
