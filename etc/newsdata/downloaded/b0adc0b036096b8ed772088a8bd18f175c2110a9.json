New York is just one of hundreds of cities in 156 countries and regions (including Antarctica) with thousands of protesters filling the streets. For the most part, they've all been students.\n\nNew York's Education Department let students skip class to join the ranks in the march, which began at 12:30 pm, making its way down Broadway toward Battery Park.
