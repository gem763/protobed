The public is being told, both in the news and entertainment media, that there is a White House-instigated constitutional crisis in Washington, the economy is rushing headlong into an inevitable recession and that other nations, especially our allies, despise us. The country\u2019s collective nervous breakdown includes a belief that the Earth itself is on the verge of becoming unlivable.\n\nNone of that is accurate.\n\nIt is true that the opposition to the Trump presidency is unprecedented. Other than the election of Abraham Lincoln, no other transition of power has led to more extraordinary reactions from the opposition party and the bureaucracy. This is not, however, the result of anything the 45th president has done or promised to do in terms of public policy, other than promising to run the nation as the U.S. Constitution mandates.\n\nI covered the inauguration in 2017. There were protesters calling for his impeachment even before he was sworn in. The \u201ccrisis\u201d is the result of the refusal by professional Washington to accept the will of the people, eerily misusing the resources of the intelligence services to pursue their partisan purpose.\n\nYes, President Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord. The reality is that even if every tenet of that agreement were fully complied with it would make almost no impact on the environment. More to the point, despite the rantings and dire predictions of those who seek to use \u201cMan Made Climate Change\u201d as an excuse to revamp world economics into a socialist model, there remains no convincing evidence that any changes will be severely detrimental or that humans are responsible.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the U.S. economy improved dramatically since this administration assumed power, and that it is the result of its policies. It\u2019s particularly evident in manufacturing, and in the employment statistics, especially for minorities.\n\nThe only option for criticism, then, is to predict that it will all soon end in an inevitable recession. Yes, cyclical recessions can and do occur, but the strengthening of America\u2019s financial status, particularly due to President Trump\u2019s energy policies, is solid and enduring.\n\nThe nightly news regularly paints a portrait of Washington being isolated from its allies. The reality is far different. Shortly after taking office, the new president received a hero\u2019s reception in Eastern Europe, a region that was deeply relieved to be delivered from President Obama\u2019s appeasement policy in the face of Russian rearmament and its invasions of Georgia and Ukraine. Relations with key allies in the Middle East, especially Israel and Saudi Arabia, have never been better.\n\nRather than ignore the issue as his predecessors have done, Mr. Trump has confronted China about both its imperialistic designs in the Pacific and its rapacious trade policies. Nations such as Australia, Japan, India and, somewhat reluctantly, the Philippines, have taken notice and are moving closer to the United States.\n\nThe administration faces daily charges of racism about its logical stance on enforcing immigration and visa laws by those who ignore the alternative of soaring expense, crime and danger of terrorism.\n\nA Studyfinds survey found that about two in five Americans are stressed out by the political climate, one in five say they\u2019re losing sleep and nearly a third of those surveyed feel views expressed on cable news channels are driving them \u201ccrazy.\u201d It termed the impact similar to a public health crisis.\n\nPolitics is, of course, a blood sport, not meant for the feint of heart. However, the hyperbolic rhetoric, relentless assaults and frankly misleading allegations that characterize the opposition to the current White House are deeply damaging to the nation. It is a degree of partisanship that puts party gain far over the good of the nation.\n\n\u2022 Frank V.
