It\u2019s a very strange posture to be sure.\u201d\n\nCornyn explained that impeachment is a political process as opposed to a criminal proceeding, like the Muller investigation.\n\nHasty asked Cornyn how he thought this impeachment circus would impact the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a high-risk gamble by Nancy Pelosi to start this just 13 months before the election,\u201d the senator responded. \u201cWhy they didn\u2019t just decide to try and beat the president in 2020, but apparently they\u2019re losing confidence they can actually do that.\u201d\n\nCornyn said he believes the campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden is going to fade and that Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) will win the Democrat Party\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cThis (the impeachment) could well boomerang on them,\u201d Coryn explained, \u201cand it may just look to the American people like a continuation of this resistance to a Trump presidency even after he was duly elected in 2016. And if the Democrats put up somebody like Elizabeth Warren, a truly radical candidate, I think that bodes well for the president\u2019s re-election. \u201d", "description": "U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) said the Democrat's impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump is a \"desperate act.\"", "authors": ["Bob Price"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/04/Senate-Majority-Whip-John-Cornyn-closeup-getty-image.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
