He pulled out of the Iran nuclear agreement and the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, both of which Barack Obama had negotiated. He\u2019s questioned whether the NATO military alliance is worth the price. \u201cAmerica first\u201d was the slogan that helped Trump win the presidency. But he doesn\u2019t seem to believe it\u2019s the tactic that will help him keep it.\n\nRead: Republicans don\u2019t want to talk about it\n\nTrump sees foreign-policy priorities as bargaining chips, advancing or discarding them as his needs change. In an example from 2017, he dialed back public criticism of China because he wanted the country\u2019s help ending North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. That summer, his aides had drafted a speech aimed at intellectual-property theft, which they viewed as a bedrock Chinese trade practice. At Trump\u2019s insistence, they eliminated virtually all references to China in hopes of not offending its leadership at a time when he was coaxing them to lean on North Korea.\n\nThese sorts of calculations fall within the bounds of traditional statecraft. What happens, though, when Trump tosses domestic politics into the mix? What if China agreed to plow forward with an investigation into the Bidens at Trump\u2019s behest? Could that induce Trump to go softer in U.S.-China trade talks\u2014negotiations that influence the price of consumer goods, the livelihood of American farmers, and employment levels? When a president conflates personal politics with the national interest, we\u2019re left to wonder.\n\nIf Trump was worried about possible corruption involving Americans overseas, he could turn to his own country\u2019s investigators for help examining their dealings. There is, of course, a law-enforcement agency with a long tradition of investigatory work here in the sovereign United States: the FBI. It would be an abuse of power for Trump to order the FBI or the Justice Department to fast-track an investigation into any political opponent, but he would be within his rights to pass along what information he may have, Richard Painter, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, told me.\n\nBut Trump doesn\u2019t want the bureau on the case. He\u2019s spent much of his presidency savaging the FBI and the broader U.S. intelligence community, airing baseless accusations that they spied on him during the 2016 election. In an interview with ABC News in June, Trump was dismissive of the notion that it\u2019s wrong for foreign governments to provide dirt on political opponents, and that the right thing for campaigns to do when they\u2019re contacted is to involve the FBI.\n\n\u201cBut when somebody comes up with oppo research, right, they come up with oppo research, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s call the FBI.\u2019 The FBI doesn\u2019t have enough agents to take care of it,\u201d Trump told the network\u2019s George Stephanopoulos.", "description": "\u201cAmerica first\u201d was the slogan that helped Trump win the presidency.
