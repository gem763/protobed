But the exclusions are less about placating Beijing than they are an effort to provide relief to some U.S. companies who say they have been harmed by Trump's tariffs and can't find an alternative source of supply.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative did not respond to a request for an estimate of the value of trade represented by the exclusions.\n\nOther products on the three lists of tariff exclusions include certain single-speed bikes, water drinking fountains for pets, various types of pumps, heat exchangers, compressors, chest-type coolers, upright freezers, household water filter cartridges, anesthesia masks, electric-powered skateboards, three-wheeled carriages used by people with disabilities, chain-link fence panels, tractor-trailer skirts, x-ray tables, wick-burning torches for outdoor use, and dog harnesses and dog leashes.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce in partnership with RSM US LLP, an audit and tax consulting firm, released a quarterly survey report on Thursday showing that 40 percent of midsize company leaders say Trump's tariffs on imported goods are posing challenges for their business. Twenty-six percent also reported being hurt by retaliatory tariffs that China and other countries have imposed in response to Trump's duties over the last two years.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

But when Beijing retaliated, Trump expanded his action to include products outside his original target zone.\n\nBy the end of the year, Trump will have imposed either a 30 percent or a 15 percent duty on as much as $550 billion worth of Chinese goods as a result of tariff hikes set to take effect in October and December.\n\nThe pending tariff exclusions USTR will publish on Friday fall into three batches, based on when duties first went into effect in 2018. Exclusions from a total product list of $34 billion will apply retroactively from July 6, 2018; exclusions from a $16 billion list will apply retroactively from Aug. 23, 2018; and exclusions from a $200 billion list will apply retroactively from Sept. 24, 2018.\n\nThe exclusions will last for a year for products from the $34 billion and $16 billion product lists, but only until Aug. 7, 2020 for products from the $200 billion product list, USTR said.", "description": "Christmas tree lights, plastic drinking straws and hundreds of other Chinese products will be exempted from a 25 percent tariff.", "authors": ["Doug Palmer"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9e/67/62f617dc4658b35bf030d4734d36/190531-chinese-flag-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
