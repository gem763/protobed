He was at a gas station in San Jose, the country\u2019s 10th-largest city, filling up a five-gallon container with gasoline for a generator he was on his way to buy from a friend. He and his wife, an executive assistant at Intel, spent Tuesday calling nearby stores for new generators but the closest store that had one was an hour and a half away in California\u2019s Central Valley.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing what we can to keep our refrigerator and our freezer going,\u201d he said.\n\nFor many, the power shutdown was a reminder of how helpless they were without electricity. While wealthier residents were able to fall back on solar panels and battery systems for electricity, living off the grid was not an option for Sharmaine Lindahl.\n\nThe power outage had cascading consequences for Ms. Lindahl and her husband, who live in Arcata, nearly 300 miles north of San Francisco. On Tuesday night, she received a text message from PG&E warning her of the impending power shut-off. Five hours later the lights went out and all of the electrical appliances in her kitchen, the only way she can cook, were useless.\n\nMost businesses were closed in Arcata on Wednesday, she said, and gasoline was scarce.\n\nWednesday was also her husband\u2019s payday, but the bank was closed and his company paid him in cash because it could not print out checks.\n\n\u201cOur bank account is going to be overdrawn,\u201d Ms. Lindahl said. \u201cWe live paycheck to paycheck. So this is going to hit us very hard.\u201d\n\nThe Lindahls felt like their city was collateral damage: The fire risk is low in Arcata, a city along the coast whose weather this time of year is most often fog and rain.", "description": "A deliberate power outage by the state\u2019s largest utility sent residents scrambling \u2014 and debating whether it was worth it.", "authors": ["Thomas Fuller"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/us/00blackout-sonoma/00blackout-sonoma-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
