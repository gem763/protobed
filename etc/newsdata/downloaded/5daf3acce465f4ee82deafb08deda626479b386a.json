According to The Hill and Politico, Joe Biden will offer a conditional endorsement of impeachment at campaign event in Delaware within the hour. If Donald Trump refuses to cooperate with Congress on his July conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the front-runner will declare, then the House will have no option but to proceed with impeachment.\n\nIf being the operative word:\n\nFormer Vice President Biden is slated to announce on Tuesday that he will support impeaching President Trump if the White House does not cooperate in Congress\u2019 whistleblower inquiry. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make the point that Trump\u2019s latest abuses are on top of all of his prior abuses,\u201d a campaign spokesman told The Hill. \u201cHe\u2019s going to call on Trump to comply with all of Congress\u2019 outstanding, lawful requests for information \u2013 in the Ukraine matter, and in the other investigations \u2014 and if Trump does not comply, Congress has no choice but to impeach.\u201d\n\nAllahpundit mentioned this as breaking news in our previous post, but it\u2019s worth exploring in a little more depth. Biden\u2019s endorsement will almost certainly help Pelosi out in corralling the more reluctant members of her caucus. Other presidential candidates have already demanded Trump\u2019s impeachment for this issue and for obstruction in Russiagate, but Biden has been more cautious. He knows he has to appeal to precincts where Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 and where his party made cautious gains in 2018. As an establishmentarian, Biden also has a temperamental bias toward resolving this in an election, especially when the Senate won\u2019t act anyway.\n\nIn a sense, Biden\u2019s about to transfer the risk of impeachment to himself in more ways than one. Electorally, whoever the nominee is will have to deal with an impeachment (and the lack of one too, for that matter), so this isn\u2019t too much of a change on that point. However, the issue of Ukraine is an added risk for Biden, as his 2016 intervention in Ukraine\u2019s internal politics while his son Hunter was making a whole lotta money in Kyiv with a corrupt oligarch still raises questions, as Time\u2019s Ian Bremmer pointed out today:\n\nComplicating matters for Pelosi, Biden, and Trump is what might be coming from Ukraine. Allahpundit shot me this late-breaking news from The Daily Beast reporting that the Zelenskiy government is likely to pursue the case against Burisma. The probe will be conducted on Ukraine\u2019s terms, however:\n\nThe Daily Beast has learned from an influential member of Ukraine\u2019s parliament, from one of the country\u2019s prosecutors, and from a center combating corruption that the government here is likely to pursue the cases that President Donald Trump urged on President Volodymyr Zelensky in a controversial phone call last July. But not the way Trump intends, and not necessarily to the detriment of Trump challenger Joe Biden. The investigations and possible prosecutions, if they happen, would take place in the context of a new law signed by Zelensky just before his departure for the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where he is expected to meet face to face with Trump for the first time. \u2026 Nalyvaichenko said his country will be best served by pursuing an investigation related to Burisma\u2019s alleged multimillion-dollar corruption deals, not because of Trump\u2019s pressure but because Ukraine wants to know the truth about its own corruption, whether the founder of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s ex-minister of natural resources Mykola Zlochevsky from 2010 to 2012, had paid to quash the earlier investigations into the way he acquired gas licenses. \u2026 Prosecutor Sergiy Gorbatyuk investigated the founder of Burisma company, Zlochevsky, for three months in 2016, until Prosecutor General Lutsenko made a decision to drop the probe. First, Lutsenko took the case away from the investigators, then closed it down illegally, Gorbatyuk told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. \u201cThere would not have been any question [about pursuing] such cases today, if Lutsenko did not interfere in the investigations,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cI hope that with the change of management at the prosecutor general\u2019s office there will be no illegal interferences and this case as well as other probes will be investigated strictly in accordance with the law.\u201d\n\nIt was that 2016 interference that Trump alleges was motivated by Biden\u2019s intervention, and which Biden\u2019s defenders say had nothing to do with it. Lutsenko was the prosecutor appointed after Biden forced Petro Poroshenko to fire Viktor Shokin, who either was dragging his heels on all corruption probes including Burisma\u2019s (Biden\u2019s defense) or digging into Burisma too deeply and endangering Hunter Biden\u2019s golden goose (Trump\u2019s claims).\n\nDo Ukraine\u2019s actions help or hurt Trump? It might look like Zelenskiy buckled under pressure to restart the Burisma probe in order to attack Biden. Also, if Biden\u2019s defenders and other analysts are correct, it might end up vindicating Biden, especially if it turns out that Shokin really was tanking the Burisma probe. However, if the new prosecutors turn up corruption involving the 2016 firing of Shokin, that\u2019ll make Trump\u2019s case.\n\nAll of that is down the road, however. The more immediate questions are: will Trump release the transcript of the conversation, and what does it say? Lindsey Graham thinks it\u2019s a nothingburger, but if that\u2019s the case, then Trump won\u2019t release it until he can use it to embarrass Democrats. If the conversation is more ambiguous, Trump might need to pre-empt the momentum with a quick release along with explanations for whatever the transcript states. If it\u2019s bad \u2014 as in nice foreign aid ya got there, shame if anything happened to it bad \u2014 then we\u2019re on our way to impeachment either way and Trump has no incentive at all to release it. Best to keep everyone guessing than to hang yourself, one could argue, although it might not stay quiet for long if the intelligence community has the transcript.\n\nOverall, though, one has to figure that Biden hopes Trump will cooperate rather than stick both of them in the middle of a messy probe on Ukraine. It\u2019s a tossup as to which man takes more damage in that instance.", "description": "\"Biden does have a problem.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/biden-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
