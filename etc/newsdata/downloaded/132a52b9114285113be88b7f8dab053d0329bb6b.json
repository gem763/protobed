The Bears have the longest winning streak among Big 12 teams at eight in a row, but suffered a big loss last week when senior middle linebacker Clay Johnston sustained a season-ending knee injury when making an interception. Baylor has the league\u2019s best scoring defense, allowing only 17.8 points a game. Oklahoma State has averaged 39.8 points and 528.3 yards per game with the Big 12\u2019s leading rusher (Chuba Hubbard, 182.3 yards rushing per game and 13 TDs) and leading receiver (Tylan Wallace, 117.2 yards receiving per game). Baylor\u2019s 43-point loss in its last trip to Stillwater two years ago was the most lopsided in a 1-11 season, but the Bears did beat Oklahoma State at home last year.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nKansas State\u2019s run-heavy offense against TCU defense. The Wildcats spread the carries around and average about 218 yards rushing per game. The Horned Frogs lead the Big 12, allowing only 101.2 yards rushing per game. \u201cThey want to control the clock. They\u2019re going to try to come right at you in the running game and then big plays with play action,\u201d TCU coach Gary Patterson said.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS\n\nBig 12 defenses average giving up 376 total yards per game, the best by league teams since 2009. \u2026 Texas (4-2, 2-1) is 8-0 at home against Kansas (2-4), which has dropped its first three Big 12 games under coach Les Miles - the last two by a combined 62 points - since that 48-24 upset win at Boston College. \u2026 TCU at Kansas State is a matchup of 3-2 teams both coming off open dates. \u2026 Five Big 12 quarterbacks have had multiple games this season with at least 200 yards passing and 50 yards rushing. They are Oklahoma\u2019s Jalen Hurts (five), Oklahoma State\u2019s Spencer Sanders (three), and Baylor\u2019s Charlie Brewer, Iowa State\u2019s Brock Purdy and Texas\u2019 Sam Ehlinger with two each.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nFifth-ranked Oklahoma (6-0, 3-0) beat West Virginia in a 59-56 shootout last season. This time, the Sooners, with dual-threat graduate transfer quarterback Hurts, are a nearly five-touchdown favorite at home. Oklahoma is 7-0 in the series since WVU joined the Big 12. Former Oklahoma QB Austin Kendall is now the Mountaineers starter, though he got banged up in their last game.\n\nIMPACT PERFORMER\n\nTexas Tech senior linebacker Jordyn Brooks leads the Big 12 with 11.3 tackles per game, and is tied for the league lead with 11\u00bd tackles for loss. He has had at least 11 tackles in four games, with a season-high 19 against Oklahoma State two weeks ago.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Some things to watch Saturday, when Big 12 teams go into the second half of their regular season:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Hawkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/baylor_revival_football_12191_c0-124-3690-2276_s1200x700.jpg?446aa7e824259d919337190f2dd98e9d4da37e01", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
