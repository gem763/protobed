It\u2019s calculated by dividing a child\u2019s weight (in kilograms) by her height (in meters) squared. It\u2019s not meant to be a diagnostic tool, and using it is so controversial for kids under 6 that experts do not agree on its efficacy. A 2017 study of 663 overweight and obese children, for example, found that B.M.I. poorly predicted the total fat mass and body fat percentage in children under 9.\n\nSo what do you do if a medical professional sounds the alarm about your young child\u2019s weight? I spoke with a childhood feeding specialist, a psychotherapist and an eating disorder specialist about how to know if your child\u2019s weight is truly a cause for concern, and what to do if there has been a dramatic and unexplained shift in your child\u2019s size.\n\nFocus on the growth chart. At your child\u2019s well checkups, her pediatrician will plot her height, weight and head circumference on a series of curves to compare her growth to the average growth of other children her age. Such comparisons will tell you what percentile she\u2019s in. If she\u2019s in the 45th percentile for height and the 38th percentile for weight, for example, that means that out of 100 children her age, she\u2019s taller than 45 kids and shorter than 55; and heavier than 38 kids and lighter than 62.\n\nKeira Oseroff, a psychotherapist and certified eating disorder specialist based in the Atlanta area, said that it\u2019s most important to pay attention to changes in \u2014 rather than placement on \u2014 the growth chart. For example, if your child has been at the 95th or 5th percentile for weight for years, and continues at that percentile each year, she is growing appropriately for her body, so it should not be cause for concern. But, if she goes from the 50th percentile to the 75th percentile to the 95th percentile (or down to 25th and then to the 5th), that may be something to investigate.\n\nIf your pediatrician flags your child\u2019s weight, the first question should be: Is this a change on his chart, and can we have a conversation about that? If it isn\u2019t a change, ask your doctor why she\u2019s concerned. Weight should not be taken alone as a measure of health \u2014 your child\u2019s sleep, eating and activity levels should also be taken into account. If your child is eating an array of healthy foods, knows when she is full and is active, you should be confident in pushing back. If your doctor will not have a real conversation with you, it may be time for a new doctor. On the flip side, if your child is not eating well and isn\u2019t active, it may be time to reassess your family\u2019s habits.", "description": "Don\u2019t panic.
