Ron Kind (Wis.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) have little in common. Kind is a 12-term veteran of Congress, a leader of the Democratic caucus\u2019s moderate wing. Tlaib is an unabashed liberal in the self-proclaimed \u201cSquad\u201d of young first-term Democrats.\n\nNeither Democrat shows up on anyone\u2019s radar for key battlegrounds next year \u2014 but both their districts are critical to the broader outcome in 2020.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the key findings of an intensive report by Third Way, a center-left think tank that analyzed all 235 districts held by House Democrats to look at where the fault lines were not just for the House but also the Senate majority and the presidency in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nThe result is a portrait of the Democratic coalition, from the rural edge of Kind\u2019s western Wisconsin district to the inner-city neighborhoods of Tlaib\u2019s Detroit-based district, that shows the path to victory at every level of power in Washington.\n\nKind, for example, sits in a district that flipped from supporting Barack Obama in 2012 to backing Donald Trump in 2016, a year in which Wisconsin narrowly sided with the GOP nominee. And poor turnout in Tlaib\u2019s hometown helped Trump put Michigan in his win column.\n\nEven as Kind, 56, and Tlaib, 43, presumably cruise to reelection next year, the margins they run up might prove decisive to their states\u2019 critical total of 26 electoral votes. They have the potential to help boost, or deflate, the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, a sign of how Democrats need to push to get every vote possible next year.\n\n\u201cJust focusing on one thing is not going to be enough. You need all of it,\u201d David de la Fuente, the author of the Third Way report, said in an interview.\n\nHe mapped out which seats are key to victories that will enable Democrats to retain the House majority as well as win back the Senate and the presidency.\n\n[\u2018It ain\u2019t going to be easy\u2019: Freshman House Democrats learn the limits of Washington in border bill fight]\n\nIn all, de la Fuente\u2019s report focused on 99 House districts that had at least one of five attributes: the 43 freshman Democrats who flipped a Republican seat in 2018; any Democrat whose margin of victory last year was in single digits; the 31 districts that Trump won in 2016; any seat in a presidential battleground; and any seat in a state with a key Senate race.\n\nThird Way, created in the \u201cNew Democrat\u201d mold of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, often clashes with more liberal activists over party ideology, but in this report the group has tried to illustrate the range of political geography Democrats need to focus their energy on to ensure a broad victory.\n\nSo, in this regard, Third Way places double the value on Tlaib, whose staunchly liberal positions would be out of place with the group\u2019s moderate policy prescriptions. But her seat could prove critical to building turnout for the presidential race and to reelect Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), one of the few incumbent Democrats that Republicans want to target in a year the GOP will mostly be on defense.\n\nHere\u2019s why: In 2016, Tlaib\u2019s district gave Hillary Clinton a margin of victory of almost 61 percentage points, which might seem staggering. But four years earlier, that district gave Obama a nearly 71-point margin.\n\nTrump won Michigan by fewer than 11,000 votes, making that small drop in Detroit critical to Clinton\u2019s defeat statewide.\n\nDown in North Carolina, Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D) has easily won for 15 years, but the former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus has a district that might be key to tipping the state\u2019s 15 electoral votes to Democrats.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Butterfield could help the Democratic nominee for the Senate race against Sen. Thom Tillis (R), a contest that could serve as a tipping point for control of the Senate.\n\nWithout a comprehensive effort, Democrats fear a new president would be stymied if Republicans still control the Senate, where the GOP could block or water down the Democratic agenda, similar to Obama\u2019s second term.\n\n\u201cIt determines whether Democrats can accomplish anything in 2021,\u201d said Lanae Erickson, the group\u2019s senior vice president and a policy expert.\n\nSome obviously important Democratic seats are even more critical when looking up and down the ballot in their respective states. These are what de la Fuente calls \u201cfive point races\u201d: freshman Democrats who narrowly won a GOP-held seat in 2018, running for reelection in districts that Trump won two years before, whose states will also be battlegrounds in the presidential and Senate contests.\n\nThere are eight \u201cfive-point\u201d Democrats: Reps. Abby Finkenauer (Iowa), Cindy Axne (Iowa), Angie Craig (Minn.), Jared Golden (Maine), Elaine Luria (Va.), Elissa Slotkin (Mich.), Abigail Spanberger (Va.), and Haley Stevens (Mich.).\n\n[Two Democrats from Pennsylvania exemplify the diversity of the freshman class]\n\nGolden carries even more value because Maine allocates some of its electoral votes based on performance within congressional districts, allowing Trump to claim an extra vote for winning the northern Maine district despite losing narrowly statewide.\n\nIf Golden, a Marine veteran from Iraq and Afghanistan, can win next year by a sizable margin, he could secure the state for the Democratic nominee and also help knock off Sen. Susan Collins (R) in another critical race.\n\nSome House Democrats understand the dynamics. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of updraft,\u201d said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (Pa.).\n\nIn 2018, after state courts drew new districts, Scanlon won a competitive primary and coasted to a nearly 2-to-1 margin of victory in the general election. Republicans have no intention of fighting to regain that district, but Scanlon fully intends to run as robust a campaign as possible to drive up the turnout in suburban Delaware County and Philadelphia\u2019s southern neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the country. I ran thinking about the country,\u201d she said, explaining her initial rationale for running was to provide a broad Democratic victory. \u201cI think people are undercounting the passion in places like my district, particularly among women.\u201d\n\nBut after the disappointment of 2016, many Democrats are afraid to be confident. They fear that Trump will win reelection by the narrowest of margins again, or that even if he loses, the new Democratic president will face a divided Congress that leaves the new agenda completely stalled.\n\nSome are warning that it\u2019s time for a broad focus, from the dairy farms outside Eau Claire to the heart of Detroit.\n\n\u201cEverything is so siloed in this town,\u201d said Erickson, of Third Way. \u201cThere are voters that matter in each of these districts.\u201d\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "An analysis by Third Way of all 235 districts held by Democrats identified the high-value political targets for the party \u2014 for the presidency and control of the House and Senate.", "authors": ["Paul Kane", "Senior Congressional Correspondent", "September At Am", "Paul Kane Is The Washington Post'S Senior Congressional Correspondent", "Columnist.
