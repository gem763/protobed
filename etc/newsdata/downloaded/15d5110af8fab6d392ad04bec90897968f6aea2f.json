You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe official Madame Tussauds Twitter account also shared a photograph of the waxwork taking centre stage alongside members of the royal family with a crown on her head, tweeting the caption: \u201cTake your throne, Queen Bey.\u201d\n\nThe museum explained that the \u201conly fitting way to laud official music royalty\u201d was to \u201cposition her on the most regal of all stages alongside her royal pals, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u201d.\n\nThe waxwork for Queen Elizabeth II was temporarily moved for one day in order to make room for the 23-time Grammy Award-winning artist.\n\n\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 is a living legend, rightly crowned Queen Bey by her legions of fans and industry insiders,\u201d said Steve Davies, general manager at Madame Tussauds London.\n\n\u201cIf anyone is fitting of a claim to the Queen\u2019s spot in our attraction for the very first time, it\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d\n\nDavies added that he thinks the monarch would find the temporary replacement of her waxwork amusing.\n\n\u201cIn the words of Beyonc\u00e9 herself, Her Majesty is most definitely \u2018irreplaceable\u2019 so Queen Bey will take her spot for one day only before her figure moves to own our music stage,\u201d the manager stated.\n\nThe new Beyonc\u00e9 waxwork has proven immensely popular among her fans, particularly due to the fact that previous wax depictions of the singer have been far less accurate.\n\n\u201cDid they 3D print this one? Because the previous ones were made by people who clearly had never seen Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s face. Well done, Madame Tussauds,\u201d one person tweeted.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
