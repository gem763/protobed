At that point, the U.K. was on the verge of crashing out of the E.U. without basic rules in place, having treated the world to a spectacular display of self-delusion and parliamentary dysfunction. And yet it turns out that all of that was only a warmup. Boris Johnson, who replaced Theresa May as Prime Minister last month, has applied all of his cleverness to move the definition and practice of time-wasting to new extremes. In a particularly patience-smashing move, earlier this week, he requested and received Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s consent for a \u201cprorogation\u201d of the current session of the House of Commons, which means that it would be suspended as soon as September 9th, with no parliamentary business to be conducted between then and October 14th. The practical effect is that Parliament will have even less time to do anything before the October 31st deadline, such as blocking a no-deal Brexit. And some of the scarce remaining time will be filled with the centuries-old rituals that attend the reopening of Parliament\u2014waste camouflaged by ceremonial frippery.\n\nJohnson claimed that proroguing Parliament was just an efficient way to get the government organized regarding its domestic agenda, such as new plans for the National Health Service and strategies for fighting crime. It had nothing to do, he claimed, with his stated intention to take the U.K. out of the E.U. on October 31st, \u201ccome what may.\u201d Very few people buy this explanation (only about thirteen per cent of the public, according to an Ipsos MORI poll). And so a certain amount of time is also due to be expended arguing a point that is already clear: Boris Johnson is a liar. This is not simply a matter of honor. Prime Ministers have a lot of latitude in proroguing Parliament, but doing so in bad faith, for false reasons that hide the true goal of evading Parliament in order to carry out a program that runs against the wishes of a majority of M.P.s, may well violate the strictures of British constitutionalism. (Johnson\u2019s cynical maneuver parallels the Trump Administration\u2019s attempt to use a made-up pretext to insert a citizenship question from the census, which the Supreme Court rejected.)\n\nJohn Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, has called the move a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d; Jacob Rees-Mogg, an arch Brexiteer who is now the leader of the House of Commons, said that Bercow and others were \u201ccrying Constitutional wolf,\u201d whatever that means. Because the U.K.\u2019s constitution is largely uncodified, and reliant on practice and precedent, there is some genuine uncertainty about what is being set in motion. The Prime Minister\u2019s power relies on the presumption that he can, when it comes down to it, muster a majority in Parliament, and it\u2019s not at all clear that Johnson does. Possible outcomes include a no-confidence vote or a new general election, at some point\u2014but, meanwhile, October 31st is getting closer.\n\nThree major court challenges to the prorogation have already been launched in separate courts in three of the U.K.\u2019s constituent parts: England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The case in Scotland was brought by Joanna Cherry, an M.P. with the Scottish National Party, who was joined by dozens of other legislators. On Friday, a judge denied them an immediate injunction but set a further hearing for Tuesday, saying that it was \u201cin the interest of justice that it proceeds sooner rather than later.\u201d The English plaintiffs include John Major, a former Prime Minister from Johnson\u2019s own party, and Jo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats; they\u2019ll have a hearing on Thursday. And there will be yet another hearing on Friday, in Belfast; there, the case has been brought by Raymond McCord, a peace activist who argues that a no-deal Brexit would violate the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. (He has a point.)\n\nIreland remains at the heart of the problem, because Brexiteers can\u2019t seem to accept that leaving the E.U. will also change the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the Republic of Ireland, which will remain an E.U. member, and thus change the nature of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The agreement that Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, negotiated with the E.U. included what is called the \u201cIrish backstop\u201d\u2014basically, it allowed time to figure out how the border would work, and put in place what amounted to an insurance policy to make sure it would get done. This would involve keeping the U.K. in line with the E.U.\u2019s customs regime and rules until a final deal is worked out. Johnson insists that the backstop be scrapped but has no plan to replace it with anything but an assurance that, with a little time, he\u2019ll figure it all out. On Friday, Ireland\u2019s deputy Prime Minister observed that this was not a serious suggestion. Johnson, he said, had yet to offer \u201cany credible\u201d alternative to the backstop.\n\nThe Johnson government protests that it has lots of proposals and plans and negotiations in the works. The Transportation Secretary, Grant Shapps, though, undercut that message, on Friday, by saying that he doubted there would be \u201csomething new\u201d for M.P.s to discuss until the next summit of E.U. leaders, on October 17th\u2014and so proroguing Parliament was no big deal. Members of Parliament, in both parties, are likely to disagree. The House of Commons reconvenes next week, after its summer recess, and the days it has left are likely to be furious ones.
