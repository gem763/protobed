Amazon says it\u2019s one of the most commonly asked questions to its Echo smart speakers. So the new Echo Dot comes with a built-in clock that saves me some of that grief. It\u2019s a simple addition: some LEDs embedded under the Dot\u2019s fabric-coated rim that can display the time all of the time.\n\nThe $59.99 Echo Dot with clock (yes, that\u2019s the real name) is a 360-degree omnidirectional speaker, and the only thing that makes it different from last year\u2019s Echo Dot are the LEDs that occupy a small area on its front, opposite the power plug, facing you head-on. In addition to telling the time, it can also display info to complement a few other basic verbal requests. If you ask for the temperature, it will briefly show the current temperature in place of the time while Alexa\u2019s voice provides a more detailed breakdown of the weather. If you set a timer, this Echo Dot will show you a countdown clock, which is great because it reminds you that, no, you didn\u2019t forget to set a timer for your cookies in the oven. One other great feature is that, after setting an alarm, a little dot will appear next to the time to remind you that it\u2019s set.\n\nOur review of Amazon Echo Dot Clock Verge Score 8.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Powerful sound for the price\n\nYou\u2019ll no longer have to ask for the time\n\nCan also display weather info and timers Bad Stuff The clock adds $10 to the price\n\nCan\u2019t be mounted without additional accessories like the Nest Mini\n\nDisplay could use a scheduling tool Buy for $59.99 from Amazon\n\nAmazon makes several Echo smart displays and smart speaker devices, and so far, the divide between the two has been distinct: if you want to look at stuff on a screen, get the Echo Show. But if you want to hear stuff, save some of that money and just get an Echo speaker. The new Echo Dot with clock ever so slightly blurs the line between the two. Adding a clock to a speaker is such a basic addition, and it\u2019s by no means alluring to look at, but that\u2019s the point. It\u2019s meant to reduce the friction that can sometimes bubble up while using a display-free device. Beyond being a nice quality-of-life tweak, this visual info is a useful accessibility feature that makes Amazon\u2019s most affordable Echo easy to recommend if you hate asking your smart speaker for the time.\n\nAs I mentioned, nothing else about this new Echo Dot has changed, but that\u2019s not such a bad thing. It has the same living room-friendly charm as the third-generation speaker that released last year. It technically is a third-gen Dot, just with a clock. Like the other Echo speakers, this one has the signature blue ring of LEDs around its top that illuminate when Alexa is beckoned. Amazon didn\u2019t take the year between releases to improve the sound quality at all \u2014 at least, not in a noticeable way. This speaker still sounds good for its price, though it\u2019s now up against some improved competition, namely Google\u2019s new second-generation Nest Mini.\n\nThe Amazon Echo Dot\u2019s side-firing speakers push out decent sound when it\u2019s set on a table, unlike the Nest Mini\u2019s upward-firing speakers, which sound comparatively flat sitting next to it. If you just want a speaker that lays on your desk, kitchen table, or countertop, Amazon\u2019s speaker is the preferable choice. Also, this is the mini smart speaker to buy if you want a 3.5mm audio jack that allows you to plug into a more powerful sound system.\n\nBoth speakers support Bluetooth for pairing up a phone or connecting to a better-sounding Bluetooth speaker if you\u2019d prefer just to use the Echo Dot for voice commands. The biggest downside to Amazon\u2019s speaker is that, unlike the Nest Mini, it can\u2019t be easily mounted to your wall, and judging from its speaker arrangement (as well as the clock), it just isn\u2019t engineered to accommodate being flat on your wall. When Google\u2019s speaker is mounted, that upward-firing speaker turns into an outward-firing speaker, and it results in a big lift for its sound output, offering warmer and more expressive sound pushed out at eye-level.\n\nThe clock is by no means alluring to look at, but that\u2019s the point\n\nAs my colleague Dan Seifert noted in his review of last year\u2019s Echo Dot, you can buy two of them and pair them for proper stereo playback. They can pair wirelessly via the Alexa app, and you can tweak their sound settings (bass, treble, and midrange) verbally or through the Alexa app. If you go this route, you\u2019ll probably want some extra power in the bass department. Amazon sells the Echo Sub for $129, and it\u2019s a suitably compact and somewhat affordable way to bring the bass to your setup. But for the $250 you\u2019ll spend for this whole setup, you\u2019re probably better off getting the Echo Studio instead, saving $50.\n\nHere\u2019s what you might be thinking at this point: having two Echo Dots in the same room displaying the time will look pretty stupid. The good news is that you can customize its display through the app or verbally. As far as settings go, you can adjust the brightness and whether it\u2019s on or off, in general. The speaker has an ambient sensor that automatically adjusts the display\u2019s brightness depending on the amount of light in the room so that it\u2019s not too bright at night or too dim during the day. It\u2019d be better if Amazon offered a scheduling tool for the display, but the ambient sensor works well enough.\n\nAGREE TO CONTINUE: AMAZON ECHO DOT WITH CLOCK Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we\u2019re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. In order to use the Echo Dot with clock, you\u2019ll need to download the Alexa app for iOS and Android. An Amazon account is required to sign in. By signing up for one of those, you must agree to its conditions of use. After that, the Alexa app will ask what sort of device you want to connect with. Just know that once you click on the device, you agree to a whole host of mandatory terms. In Amazon\u2019s own words: \u201cBy proceeding, you agree to Amazon\u2019s conditions of use and all of the terms found here.\u201d You can explore the documentation at that link, but below, we\u2019ve listed the 12 terms that you must agree to. Alexa Terms of Use\n\nAmazon Conditions of Use\n\nAmazon Privacy Policy\n\nChildren\u2019s Privacy Disclosure\n\nAmazon Prime Terms\n\nAmazon Music Terms of Use\n\nKindle Store Terms of Use\n\nAudible Service Conditions of Use\n\nAmazon Dash Replenishment Terms of Use\n\nAmazon FreeTime Unlimited Terms & Conditions, and Kindle FreeTime Unlimited T&C\n\nAmazon Photos Terms of Use\n\nAmazon Device Terms of Use Final tally: 13 mandatory agreements\n\nEven though the Amazon Echo Dot with clock works off of last year\u2019s speaker technology, the addition of a clock is as convenient an upgrade as you might expect. A feature like this lets me get on with my life without having to ask life\u2019s most mundane queries, then wait for Alexa to reply. And since I\u2019m better at absorbing visual information than I am with auditory cues, seeing the time sticks in my mind more so than hearing Alexa rattle it off.\n\nAmazon thinks this added convenience is worth an extra $10 over the regular price of the third-generation Echo Dot, which it somewhat confusingly continues to sell. If you\u2019re thinking of upgrading, there are cheaper ways to get a clock in your home. And if you wait, it\u2019s highly likely that Amazon will discount it in time for the holidays. But considering this clock just so happens to come with a good speaker and an intelligent voice assistant makes $59 seem like a reasonable cost.", "description": "Amazon\u2019s new Echo Dot with clock changes almost nothing about 2018\u2019s third-generation smart speaker, except it added a clock to the side.
