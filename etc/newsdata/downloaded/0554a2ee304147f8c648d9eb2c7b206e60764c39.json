China\u2019s Manufacturing Sector Keeps Getting Whacked by Trump\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The outlook for China\u2019s manufacturing sector deteriorated further in August, underlining the weakness in the domestic economy just as a new round of tariffs kicks in.\n\nThe manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index dropped to 49.5, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Saturday, with sub-gauges showing that domestic and new overseas orders contracted. On Sunday, higher U.S. tariffs on roughly $110 billion in Chinese imports took effect, as did Beijing\u2019s retaliatory duties on U.S. goods coming the other way.\n\nU.S President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war continues to heap pressure on China\u2019s economy and policy makers at a time when economic output is already in a long-term deceleration. Until now, officials have stuck doggedly to a relatively limited roster of stimulus measures out of concern that more ambitious support would further swell indebtedness and over-inflate the frothy property market.\n\n\u201cWhile we find Beijing\u2019s self-restraint admirable, we are unsure whether this well-intended master plan could be put into practice, as the risks to growth may have been underestimated,\u201d analysts at Nomura International Ltd including Lu Ting wrote in a note. Toward the end of the year the government \u201cmay be compelled to increase credit growth and ease its tightening measures on property markets again.\u201d\n\nThe government is not sounding the alarm just yet. Late Sunday, the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, released a statement saying that overall risks are \u201ccontrollable\u201d and the economy is stable. At the same time, counter-cyclical adjustments in economic policy will be increased, according to the statement.\n\nExport Contraction\n\nThe sub-index gauging new export orders rose to 47.2, but was still in contraction, while new orders contracted further. The extra tariffs will now hit manufacturers harder.\n\nA 15% additional U.S. duty hit consumer goods ranging from footwear and apparel to home textiles and certain technology products like the Apple (NASDAQ: ) Watch. A separate batch of about $160 billion in Chinese goods -- including laptops and cellphones -- will be hit with 15% tariffs on Dec. 15.\n\nIn turn, China targeted U.S. agricultural and manufacturing centers in the Midwest and South, with higher tariffs on soybeans and other farm goods plus the ramping up of charges on U.S. autos -- where duties can now total as much as 50%.\n\nIn the PMI report, the index showing prices at the factory door continue to decline, although the renewed contraction of input prices should relieve some of the pressure on company profits.\n\nThe economy slowed in July and a set of early data collated by Bloomberg showed the trend continuing in August, with poor sales managers\u2019 sentiment and falling trade. However, an improvement in small business confidence is a sign that earlier pro-growth measures may be having an effect.\n\nSmall Business Glimmer\n\nEconomists continue to warn that the trade war risks dragging the global economy into recession, a development that would ultimately feed through into Chinese domestic demand. For now, officials may take some encouragement from the relative strength of the services and construction PMI index, which rose marginally in August and remains in expansion.\n\nThat partly reflects the long-term shift of the economy away from investment and exports and toward a consumption-led growth model.\n\nThere are signs that the rapid escalation in the trade war in recent weeks could be topping out. Last week China indicated that it wouldn\u2019t immediately retaliate against the next round of higher U.S. duties. Trump indicated Friday that negotiations between the two nations slated for September are still going ahead.\n\nHowever with each new downbeat data release, Chinese policy makers face greater pressure to abandon their restrained stimulus approach.\n\n\u201cIn a macro environment with a weaker credit cycle and falling nominal growth, there is room and urgency for monetary policy to loosen, in order to prevent real interest rates from rising further,\u201d economists at China International Capital Corp. led by Yue wrote.", "description": "China\u2019s Manufacturing Sector Keeps Getting Whacked by Trump", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEBBS012_L.jpg"}
