Sessions, who eventually was fired by Trump in 2018, ultimately did not meet with Lewandowski.\n\nThe committee\u2019s Democratic chairman, Jerrold Nadler, called Lewandowski\u2019s conduct at the hearing \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and was considering seeking to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nLewandowski appeared at the panel\u2019s first hearing since it made clear last week it is actively considering articles of impeachment against Trump. Mueller told the panel in July about his inquiry that detailed Russian interference in the 2016 election to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy, the Trump campaign\u2019s willingness to accept Moscow\u2019s help and the president\u2019s actions to impede the investigation.\n\n\u201cWe as a nation, would be better served if elected officials like yourselves concentrated your efforts to combat the true crises facing our country as opposed to going down rabbit holes like this hearing,\u201d Lewandowski said in his opening statement.\n\nNadler began the hearing, focussed on \u201cpresidential obstruction of justice and abuse of power,\u201d by slamming the White House for instructing Lewandowski on Monday not to discuss conversations with Trump after he became president by invoking a doctrine called executive privilege.\n\n\u201cWe should call this what it is: an absolute cover-up by the White House,\u201d Nadler said.\n\n\u201cThe White House is advancing a new and dangerous theory: the crony privilege,\u201d Nadler added.\n\nA group of White House lawyers sat behind Lewandowski during the hearing, a fact noted by Democratic lawmakers who repeatedly hammered the former campaign manager. Trump fired Lewandowski in June 2016 but remained close to him in subsequent years.\n\nCorey Lewandowski, U.S. President Donald Trump's former campaign manager and close confidant, is sworn in to testify at the start of the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment investigation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 17, 2019. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the House has the power to vote to impeach a president while the Senate then would hold a trial on whether to remove him from office. The House is controlled by Democrats and the Senate by Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans.\n\n\u2018ABSOLUTELY IMMUNE\u2019\n\nTwo other witnesses - former Trump White House aides Rob Porter and Rick Dearborn - had been scheduled to appear but the White House directed them not to testify, contending they were \u201cabsolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony with respect to matters related to their service as senior advisers to the President.\u201d\n\nLewandowski confirmed Mueller\u2019s account of a June 2017 meeting at the White House in which Trump asked him to deliver a message to Sessions that the attorney general should shift the Russia probe\u2019s focus to future elections despite his recusal from the investigation due to his own contacts with Russia\u2019s former U.S. ambassador.\n\nAt times Lewandowski provided details not included in Mueller\u2019s investigative report released in April, despite the White House\u2019s instructions to limit his testimony. Lewandowski, for example, said he never delivered the message to Sessions because he went on a beach vacation with his children.\n\nAt a second meeting a month later, Trump asked about the status of his message and said Lewandowski should \u201ctell Sessions he was fired\u201d if he would not meet with Lewandowski, according to the Mueller report.\n\n\u201cI took that as a joke,\u201d Lewandowski testified about the firing threat.\n\nLewandowski also acknowledged he did not want to confer with Sessions at the Justice Department, which would have created a public record of his planned meeting.\n\nLewandowski faced friendlier questions from Republican lawmakers, who unsuccessfully sought to have the hearing adjourned early on and accused Democrats of pursuing an endless and fruitless investigation of Trump for political purposes.\n\nTrump on Twitter called Lewandowski\u2019s testimony \u201cbeautiful.\u201d\n\nLewandowski assailed the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear the investigation was populated by many Trump haters who had their own agenda - to try and take down a duly elected president of the United States. As for actual \u2018collusion\u2019 or \u2018conspiracy,\u2019 there was none. What there has been however, is harassment of the president from the day he won the election,\u201d Lewandowski testified.\n\nLewandowski testified that while he had not read the Mueller report and he never called into questions its findings. Lewandowski also acknowledged attending an event where he signed copies of the report.\n\nSlideshow (20 Images)\n\nBarry Berke, a lawyer for the House Democrats, questioned Lewandowski about an appearance on the MSNBC news channel in which he made comments that contradicted his testimony to Mueller.\n\n\u201cPerhaps I was inaccurate at the time,\u201d Lewandowski testified, adding that \u201cI have no obligation to have a candid conversation with the media.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump's former campaign manager on Tuesday acknowledged that his former boss enlisted him to try to limit the Russia election interference inquiry but defended Trump and tangled with Democrats during pugnacious testimony to a U.S. congressional panel mulling whether to impeach the president.", "authors": ["David Morgan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430945472&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1LG", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
