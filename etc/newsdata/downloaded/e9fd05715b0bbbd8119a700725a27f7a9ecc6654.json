The new 11.6-inch Chromebook 4 has been released today for a starting price of $229.99, along with the larger 15.6-inch Chromebook 4 Plus that starts at $299.99.\n\nA lot has changed in the Chrome OS market since the Chromebook 3 was introduced, and the Chromebook 4 reflects several of those changes, starting with a slightly more modern, high-end look that\u2019s akin to the Asus Chromebook Flip C302. Samsung went with Intel Celeron N4000 processors across the line, and both Chromebook 4s charge via USB-C: the 11.6-inch model has a single USB-C port, while the 15.6-inch model has two, one on each side. Both also include a 30W USB-C power adapter in the box and a single USB Type-A port and headphone / microphone-in jack.\n\nSamsung notes that the USB-C port isn\u2019t just for powering the laptop. You can transfer data at speeds up to 5Gb/s, and connect to a 4K monitor as well. Another welcome improvement is out-of-the-box support for Android apps.\n\nMultiple configurations in both sizes will be available, differing in RAM (4GB or 6GB LPDDR4) and onboard storage available (32GB or 64GB eMMC); all configs feature a microSD card slot. The screen resolution of the 11.6-inch Chromebook 4\u2019s LED screen is unchanged from its predecessor\u2019s 1366 x 768. The 15.6-inch Chromebook 4 Plus\u2019 LED display offers 1080p resolution.\n\nThe same 39Wh battery is used for both devices\n\nSamsung estimates that the smaller Chromebook 4 will yield 12.5 hours of battery life, while the 15.6-inch model will last up to 10.5 hours per charge. Instead of putting a larger battery into the Chromebook 4 Plus, the same 39Wh battery is used for both devices.\n\nRelated The best Chromebook you can buy right now\n\nLike its predecessor, the Chromebook 4 looks to be a relatively no-frills, but competent addition to the selection of Chrome OS devices. There\u2019s no touchscreen, it\u2019s not a 2-in-1 device, and it doesn\u2019t include a pull-out stylus, but for what it offers, $229 seems to be a good value.\n\nThe Chromebook 4 and 4 Plus are available today from Samsung.com and Best Buy.", "description": "If you\u2019re looking for an affordable Chromebook with USB-C charging and Google Play Store support, Samsung\u2019s new Chromebook 4 and Chromebook 4 Plus may be a good fit. They release today, October 7th, starting at $229.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7HM79287dTi7mNgM6qGzEGu8fX4=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19260562/samsunghero.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
