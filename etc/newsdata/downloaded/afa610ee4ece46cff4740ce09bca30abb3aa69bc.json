He also said he was unaware Mr Trump had raised the matter with Mr Morrison.\n\n\"I had a conversation with this guy and I passed on one element of the conversation to the Americans. There's just nothing more to it,\" Mr Downer said.\n\n\"I know nothing about conversations that Scott Morrison has had with the Americans, including President Trump, about this.\"\n\nThe departments of Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs and the Attorney-General declined to say whether they have subsequently been contacted by the Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe request by Mr Trump has embroiled Australia in the impeachment scandal surrounding the President after he enlisted the Ukrainians to try to damage potential presidential rival Joe Biden.\n\nIt \"shows the extent to which Mr Trump sees the attorney-general as a critical partner in his goal to show that the Mueller investigation had corrupt and partisan origins,\" The New York Times reported.\n\nIt also shows \"the extent that Mr Trump sees the Justice Department inquiry as a potential way to gain leverage over America\u2019s closest allies.\n\n\"And like the call with the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, the discussion with Mr Morrison shows the President using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests.\"", "description": "Scott Morrison is under pressure to explain what, if any, assistance Australia provided to help Donald Trump try to torpedo the Mueller probe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4182%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_220%2C$y_103/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7a34448508d1dc379f5e99c14b9acc8c944d7e9c", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
