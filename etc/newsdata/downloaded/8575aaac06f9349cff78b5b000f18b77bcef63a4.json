Elizabeth Warren is the front-runner now and these double-digit candidates and multi-hour yak fests make the Academy Awards look like the Indianapolis 500.\n\nThe former may be a true upturning of conventional wisdom, but the latter is becoming mind-numbingly irrelevant.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nYes, a thankful Sen. Bernie Sanders may be \u201cfeeling great\u201d in his return to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack two weeks ago today, but most of the rest of the contenders right now look like they are slow walking themselves to potential cabinet gigs in a Warren or Joe Biden cabinet.\n\nBy the last half hour of the three-hour affair Tuesday night, the debate co-hosted by CNN and the New York Times seemed to exhaust the participants, the moderators and the relatively quiet audience \u2013 which is likely not how FDR or JFK would have played it. By the time it got to the imaginary friends question launching off the recent in-the-news relationship between Ellen DeGeneres and the once toxically unpopular George W. Bush, late-night hosts must have been screaming at their writers for not thinking of that for their monologues.\n\nEven small-screen addict Donald Trump must have zoned out and decided tonight to center his Twitter ire on House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff instead of those out for his job.\n\nIn case you didn\u2019t know, appearing tonight at Ohio\u2019s Otterbein University were, in alphabetical order, ex-VP Biden, Sen. Cory Booker, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, IN, ex-HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, ex-congressman and Texas Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, Vermont\u2019s Sanders, longtime impeachment-advocating businessman Tom Steyer, Warren, and former tech executive Andrew Yang.\n\nFollowing an anti-climactic Capitol Hill press conference from Speaker Nancy Pelosi and another fiery prologue by DNC boss Tom Perez, Warren came onstage to the largest applause of the 12 contenders. In a tightly run show on the Jeff Zucker-run outlet, only Mayor Pete garnered a similar roar, which may tell you a lot about how enthusiastic Democrats are about their own candidates.\n\nFamiliar domestic policy for Democrats like healthcare, taxing the rich, damning Amazon and Facebook, and reproductive rights were on the agenda from CNN moderators Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett and the NYT\u2019s National Editor Marc Lacey, as was a dollop of foreign policy. Still, with a new face like the soon-forgotten Steyer and the absence of hecklers for once, fundamentally this debate was like every other debate the Democrats have had this year. The wannabes tried to punch up and Warren, Sanders, and Biden held the top spots \u2013 which to quote Johnny Rotten was just boring.\n\nIt was also a truly kamikaze outcome in fast-moving times and a failure of the format, once again.\n\nOn a stage stuffed with more candidates that any previous debate, the rules gave each participant 75 seconds to answer questions, 45 seconds for their responses and rebuttals and a swift 15 seconds for clarification \u2013 which is not a debate by any measure. It\u2019s a slug match of pitches looking for cracks to shine some policy or personality sunshine through. Or to paraphrase Sanders, it was \u201cthe same old same old.\u201d\n\nThe fact is America and the world right now are not the same old same old.\n\nSince the last time the contenders to replace Trump gathered, on September 24, the incumbent has been tangled in an impeachment inquiry after leaning on the Ukrainian leadership to dig up dirt on Biden and his family.\n\nAdd to the pedal to the speed metal of American politics in 2019, the blast radius from Trump\u2019s heavy handedness has permeated almost every aspect of the Executive Branch, Warren has taken the lead in the polls and in fundraising. Also, 78-year old Sanders had that health scare two week ago, the ex-Celebrity Apprentice host dropped the Kurds into the jaws of Erdogan\u2019s Turkey and upended the Middle East, and a trade deal with China may or may not be happening.\n\nEven with Tuesday\u2019s debate dragging out, the volcanic nature of those occurrences received relatively short shrift. It is not hyperbole to say that America is in the cultural equivalent of Stranger Things\u2019 Upside Down. Yet, tonight\u2019s grouping skipped along like it was just another laugh-track filled sitcom, if you know what I mean?\n\nStory continues", "description": "If there are two things that we learned tonight from the fourth Democratic debate of this primary season, it is that Sen.
