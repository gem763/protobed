We have unlimited potential, only held back by the Federal Reserve,\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nTrump, in a departure from his White House predecessors who refrained from commenting on Fed policy, has made a habit of criticizing the U.S. central bank for decisions he says kept borrowing costs too high for too long.\n\nIn September, he began to argue the Fed needed to push borrowing costs into negative territory, a step reluctantly pursued by some other central banks battling weak economic growth.\n\nFed officials are expected to announce a quarter-percentage point rate cut at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Wednesday after they wrap up their meeting. That would push the benchmark federal funds rate down to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%.
