There has to be some signal that they are working together. If there is no coordination the situation could quickly get even worse.\u201d\n\nThe return to power of protectionist Peronists comes amid a lengthy recession and a debt crunch, raising market fears of a possible default on a $57 billion IMF loan.\n\nThe peso fell 5.86 percent in the week before the elections, and the week ended with the dollar at 65 pesos.\n\n\u2013 Outright win \u2013\n\nFernandez, a 60-year-old law professor, had 48 percent of the votes \u2014 easily crossing the threshold for outright victory \u2014 after 99 percent of the votes had been counted, with center-right incumbent Macri trailing at 40.44 percent.\n\nHis win also caps a remarkable political comeback for his running mate, ex-president Cristina Kirchner, who will be his vice-president despite facing a slew of trials over graft stemming for her 2007-2015 presidency.\n\nMacri, 60, pledged \u201ca healthy and constructive opposition.\u201d\n\nHe told his supporters he had spoken by phone to Fernandez and had \u201cinvited him to breakfast tomorrow at the Casa Rosada because he has to start a period of orderly transition that will bring tranquility to Argentines.\u201d\n\nFernandez earlier vowed to end the polarization which has long divided Argentine politics between his Peronist movement and supporters of the business-friendly incumbent.\n\n\u201cThe days of \u2018Us\u2019 and \u2018Them\u2019 are over,\u201d the mustachioed leftist leader said after voting in the swanky Puerto Madero neighborhood of Buenos Aires. \u201cWe are in an enormous crisis. Everyone has to take responsibility for what\u2019s ahead.\u201d\n\nThousands of ecstatic Fernandez supporters cheered and danced outside his Frente de Todos party headquarters in Buenos Aires even before the results were announced.\n\nAt Fernandez\u2019s side, Kirchner called on Macri in the last days of his rule \u201cto take all necessary measures to alleviate this dramatic situation.\u201d\n\nArgentina\u2019s poverty rate has risen to more than 35 percent, inflation for the year to September was at almost 38 percent, while the peso has depreciated 70 percent since January 2018.\n\nMacri, whose popularity has fallen sharply in the last year as Argentina battled recession and market turmoil, said after he voted that competing \u201cvisions of the future\u201d were at stake in the polls.\n\nOn a night of disappointment for the center-right, there was some consolation when the candidate for Macri\u2019s Together for Change coalition easily won the mayorship of the city of Buenos Aires.\n\n\u2013 Regional tensions \u2013\n\nThe election came amid high tensions in the region, with massive protests in neighboring Chile and Bolivia, as well as recent unrest over inequality in Ecuador.\n\nFernandez paid tribute to Evo Morales for his election victory in neighboring Bolivia to win a fourth term, and wished jailed ex-Brazil president Luis Inacio Lula da Silva \u2014 74 on Sunday \u2014 a happy birthday.\n\nTurnout in Sunday\u2019s general election was over 80 percent after a campaign dominated by the crippling economic crisis affecting Latin America\u2019s second-biggest economy.\n\nMacri had called for a massive turnout, which analysts saw as his main hope of closing a large opinion poll deficit on Fernandez and forcing a second round.\n\nFernandez has insisted his government would not default but rather seek to renegotiate the terms of the loan, and sought to reassure voters that their bank deposits would be safe under his administration.\n\nSince Fernandez\u2019s crushing victory in August primaries, Argentine savers have withdrawn around $12 billion from their accounts.", "description": "Buenos Aires (AFP) \u2013 President-elect Alberto Fernandez has barely time to savour his emphatic triumph in Argentina\u2019s elections before facing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/34878e_supporters-argentina-presidential-election-winner-alberto-fernandez-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
