Numerous talks and performances will be held alongside the blockading actions.\n\nExtinction Rebellion have issued a map showing 22 sites to be occupied, including 11 roads into Westminster and numerous government departments.\n\nPolice arrest a climate change activist blockading Waterloo bridge during April\u2019s Extinction Rebellion protest (Picture: AFP)\n\nThe group has been stockpiling equipment including stages and sound systems at secret locations in central London before the protest.\n\nThey have spent \u00a3300,000 on equipment, lavatories, food for up to 30,000 protesters and expenses for organisers, as well as \u00a3200,000 on \u2018arts and actions\u2019.\n\nAnother \u00a3150,000 will be spent on transporting groups to the protests and \u00a375,000 on training to help protesters know their rights if arrested.\n\nExtinction Rebellion spokesperson Zoe Jones, 24, said: \u2018The public perception of XR is that we\u2019re disrupting ordinary people\u2019s lives by blocking roads and that\u2019s why this time we\u2019re taking our protests to the seat of power and taking it to Westminster.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We are on the public\u2019s side and we are ordinary people who are extremely concerned.\u2019\n\nThe group has told its activists not to cooperate with police so that they use up cells and officers\u2019 time which could be spent arresting other protesters.\n\nA boat is placed in the centre of Oxford Circus during during April\u2019s demonstration (Picture: GETTY IMAGES)\n\nThey wrote on their website: \u2018Police could often only arrest 100-200 people a day because the cells were full. If we fill them every day \u2013 the streets will remain ours.\n\n\u2018That it is why we refuse bail, to fill up the cells and to show our open defiance of the system that is killing us.\u2019\n\nMs Jones added: \u2018There is a misconception with Extinction Rebellion that to be involved you have to be arrested but that is not the case.\u2019\n\nPolicing the protests in April cost \u00a316 million.\n\nActions have now begun in Guwahati, India, and Wellington New Zealand, where it is already October 7.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
