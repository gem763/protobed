This is an outcome, regardless of how the press would like to damp it down, this was something they were trying to get for 10 years.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s joy may reflect a very different worldview than that of his military, his diplomats or the Republican leaders who say he has damaged America\u2019s reputation and influence. While his party, and Democrats, accused him of betraying allies and aiding Russia, Mr. Trump insisted he was simply making good on a campaign promise to bring troops home from \u201cendless wars.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, as Mr. Pence and Mr. Pompeo were flying to Ankara, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was challenging the president on whether there was any strategic logic to his withdrawal from Syria \u2014 especially if it resulted in freeing detained ISIS fighters who might now attack in the region or on the United States.\n\nOn Thursday, recounting her heated discussion with the president at the White House the previous day, she said she asked him how his strategy fit with his announcement last Friday that nearly 3,000 more troops were being deployed to Saudi Arabia. The president responded that the Saudis were paying the cost of that deployment \u2014 suggesting that Mr. Trump was happy to commit troops to the highest bidder among American allies, rather than make an independent judgment about their strategic importance.\n\nRepublicans also challenged the agreement reached in Ankara.\n\n\u201cThe announcement today is being portrayed as a victory. It is far from a victory,\u201d Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, said on the Senate floor Thursday. \u201cGiven the initial details of the cease-fire agreement, the administration must also explain what America\u2019s future role will be in the region, what happens now to the Kurds and why Turkey will face no apparent consequences.\u201d\n\nAnd Mr. Romney noted, \u201cThe cease-fire does not change the fact that America has abandoned an ally.\u201d\n\nAt the Pentagon on Thursday afternoon, senior officials scrambled to understand how they were supposed to carry out the agreement Mr. Pence and Mr. Erdogan had negotiated.", "description": "The agreement, announced by Vice President Mike Pence, may stop the killing in the Kurdish enclave in northern Syria.
