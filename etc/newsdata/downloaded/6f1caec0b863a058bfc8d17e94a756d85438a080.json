For those who are unfortunate enough to remember the last Addams Family movie, the dreadful Addams Family Reunion from way back in 1998, this is also a very fine return to form.\n\nFor those, however, who know of the Addams Family from the two films from the early \u201890s \u2013 The Addams Family and its superior sequel, Addams Family Values \u2013 this latest version is a far harder sell. Unfortunately, this is very much where I\u2019m coming from. I recall seeing some of the animated series from around the same time but, to me, the Addams Family is all about those two films from my late childhood that made so strong an impact that I remember them even now, literal decades since I last saw them.\n\nDo they still stand up? I have no idea, and I\u2019m somewhat reluctant to find out. In my mind, though, they\u2019re as fantastic as ever. Armed with a spectacular cast and a wonderfully twisted aesthetic, these films with their mix of unabashed sentimentality, unforgettable characters and a hilariously dark and demented sense of humour, were a left-field treat that couldn\u2019t not stand out from the more conventional fair that I was undoubtedly subjected to at the time.\n\nGoing in with this sort of sentimental attachment and a head full of still pretty vivid memories of a couple of my favourite films from when I was a kid/ young teen, certainly doesn\u2019t do this reboot many favours. Mind you, though that is countered somewhat by just how nostalgic a trip it turned out to be as it was, at the very least, a blast to be hanging out with some old favourites that I hadn\u2019t really thought about for years. Sure, they look and sound a lot different, and they are stuck in an unfortunately fairly blah plot but, even in their new form, the likes of Thing, Cousin It, Lurch, Morticia and Gomez and, most especially, Wednesday Addams (who all but walks away with the entire film) are as good company as ever.\n\nI also certainly appreciated that in an era of tetchy \"outrage culture\" and, worst of all, the unbearably sanctimonious \"anti-indecency group\", One Million Moms, it\u2019s hard not to love a movie that is as macabre, comedically violent (yup, Wednesday and Pugsley are still trying to kill each other, and their parents in an increasingly ludicrous manner and all is still right in the world) and anti-conformist as this. It\u2019s not a complete outlier, of course, as Laika Studios, in particular, has recently given us some fantastically ghoulish and often thematically mature \"kids films\" in recent years, but this is still very much the Addams Family as I remember them and not some boringly PC \"update\".\n\nAll that said, though, it\u2019s hard to fully recommend the film and harder still not be disappointed by it \u2013 and that despite my going in expecting the worst. The film has a seriously top-notch voice cast but none of them come close to capturing that quintessential Addams Family vibe in the way that the likes of Raul Julia (RIP), Christopher Lloyd, Anjelica Huston and Christina Ricci did, and the art design and animation is never as consistent as I might like (inspired touches mix with run-of-the-mill modern animation tropes).\n\nMore even than just not feeling like this depiction of the Addams Family wasn\u2019t quite right, though, which is unquestionably my own baggage, is that the plot is incredibly lacking and the storytelling basically fairly half-hearted. When there are so many outre pleasures to be had in the film\u2019s black-comedy, its embrace of the weird, and, most especially, in its timeless characters, it\u2019s crushingly disappointing that so much about the film just comes across as incredibly... rote. It all plays out with such bland predictability that when you reach the end of its snappy, 90-minute runtime, it\u2019s hard not to think, \u201cwait, was that it?\u201d as the credits begin to roll.\n\nSo, yes, if your (older) kids haven\u2019t seen the Addams Family before, you could do far worse than taking them to see this \u2013 though, of course, you could do far better by just showing them those \u201890s classics \u2013 but while older fans can breathe a sigh of relief that it doesn\u2019t entirely let the side down, it\u2019s certainly not going to replace most previous versions as the definitive take on these characters.\n\nJust a quick post-script, apropos of not very much, but is it just me, or did the Addams Family convert to Judaism somewhere along the way? The \"accepting the strangers in your mist\" moral applies to any minority group living in a wider culture but between Pugsley\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony coming across like the world\u2019s most demented bar mitzvah ceremony (including reading from the Torah, er, sorry, the \"Terror\"), Bette Midler playing Grandma Addams with a healthy dollop of yiddishe mama about her and Nick Kroll playing Fester as a very slightly more cartoony version of his \"Oh Hello\" character, Gil Faizon (charmed, I\u2019m sure), I would swear that the Addams clan are now \"members of the tribe\". Can\u2019t say I saw that coming and I may be way off base, but if not, we\u2019ll take \u2018em!", "description": "This animated reboot may not find the Addams Family at their very best but after far too many years away, it\u2019s nice to see that they haven\u2019t changed all that much.", "authors": ["Ilan Preskovsky"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2858/71066a658d3b42ada6f1adb56e87b0a0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
