Starting now, you can register your music class or classes for a chance to win one of our amazing prizes. If you register before Sept. 11, you could also win a Marshall Bluetooth speaker for your classroom.\n\nSign up here.\n\nEvery fall season, CBC Music and MusiCounts \u2014 the charity of the Juno Awards \u2014 launch this contest to engage music classes across the country.\n\nOur goals are threefold:\n\nWe want kids to learn Canadian music in the classroom. We want to draw attention to the exceptional work of music teachers in this country. We want to reinforce the importance of music in a well-rounded education.\n\nHow the challenge works\n\nEach year we pre-approve a list of Canadian songs and ask music teachers to pick one and have their class (or classes) learn a cover version. Once a class performance of the song has been captured on video, you send it to us and we post it on our YouTube channel. Our judges choose the winners.\n\nVideo submissions begin on Oct. 1. The deadline to submit your video (or videos) is Nov. 27. The top 10s in each of our main categories will be announced on Tuesday, Dec. 10. Winners will be announced one week later on Dec. 17.\n\nWho can enter?\n\nLast year, more than 1,000 music classes entered from every province and territory in Canada. And by music class we mean music clubs, after-school music programs and traditional school-board programs.\n\nWe encourage teachers to enter the challenge no matter what the playing level of their class is from kindergarten to Grade 12. Through CBC Radio, TV and digital, we will proudly showcase a variety of playing abilities, and tell the stories of communities enriched by music.\n\nIf you have any questions, read through our FAQs, and please don't hesitate to contact us at musicclass@cbc.ca.", "description": "Is your music class ready to take our challenge?
