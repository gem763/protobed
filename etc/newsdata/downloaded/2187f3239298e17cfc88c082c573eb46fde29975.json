It also said that tourism has been recognized as the most important industry helping people shake off poverty, especially in central and western provinces.\n\nFor example, Tianxi village in Liuyang, Hunan province, has transformed itself from an economic backwater into a charming tourism town.\n\nIn 2014, 212 of Tianxi's 1,415 households were in financial straits, and many others lost their livelihood when tree-felling was prohibited in the province in early 2016.\n\nTourism has since become a source of income with offerings including rural homestays and leisure activities such as fruit and vegetable picking. Moreover, the village used crowdfunding to raise 1.32 million yuan to build tourism facilities.\n\nBy the end of 2018, only 10 poor households had yet to be lifted out of poverty, and by June this year, about 90,000 travelers had generated revenue of 7 million yuan.\n\nLi Jinzao, vice-minister of culture and tourism, said tourism-driven poverty alleviation work can bring positive results to both the economic and spiritual sectors.\n\n\"Rural tourism has become the strongest force helping villagers get out of poverty,\" he said. \"About 4,800 people in 101 poor villages nationwide have shaken off poverty by being actively involved in rural tourism, accounting for 30.4 percent of those lifted out of poverty.\"\n\nThe tourism-driven poverty alleviation work has also received assistance from international organizations. For example, the World Bank financed tourism projects in provinces such as Gansu and Guizhou.\n\nIn 2008, the World Bank invested $52 million in six cities in Gansu to help develop attractions including the Great Wall in Jiayuguan Pass; Maiji Mountain, featuring grottoes and wall painting; and Yadan National Geological Park.\n\nAhmed Eiweida, World Bank global coordinator for cultural heritage and sustainable tourism, said that the organization provided support ranging from the construction of small-and medium-scale cultural infrastructure facilities and renovation of villages, to strengthening capacity and capability in the high-value agriculture and tourism sectors, which will bring new jobs, higher incomes and better living conditions.\n\n\"I believe China's experience in tourism-driven poverty reduction is valuable and applicable to many countries,\" he said. \"We need to continue working together in documenting global best practices in poverty reduction through sustainable tourism.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/10/5d9e8a97a310cf3e97a06a8d.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
