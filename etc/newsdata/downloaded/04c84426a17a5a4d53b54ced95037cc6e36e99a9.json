The last four years have also been the hottest on record. The massive United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has repeatedly warned about the rising risks of man-made climate change. A study of two decades\u2019 worth of peer-reviewed scientific research on the subject found just 1% expressed any doubt at all about man-made climate change.\n\nSo it isn\u2019t surprising there\u2019s been a surge in interest in \u201csocially responsible investing,\u201d including funds which avoid major polluters like the fossil-fuel industry.\n\nBut so far that\u2019s involved a lot more talk than action, industry data show.\n\nJust 4% of company 401(k) retirement plans offer the choice of a \u201csocially responsible\u201d mutual fund as one of its investment options, the Plan Sponsors Council of America, a trade body, tells MarketWatch.\n\nAnd just 9% of those who are offered such a fund invest in it, said Fidelity Investments, a major plan administrator. (Fidelity also said a many as a third of the plans it runs offer a socially responsible fund among its options, but could not account for the big difference with the data from the Plan Sponsors\u2019 Council).\n\nMeanwhile research by Morningstar says that despite a surge in interest in ethical investing and socially responsible mutual funds, the total amounts invested remain small.\n\nThe number of funds jumped 50% last year to 351, says the research company, and fund flows were a \u201crecord\u201d $5.5 billion.\n\nTotal assets invested in socially responsible funds? Just $161 billion at year-end, it said.\n\nThat\u2019s not even a rounding error compared with the $18 trillion invested in all stock and bond funds, as reported by the Investment Company Institute, the trade association for the mutual-fund industry.\n\nThe surprising numbers suggest that the socially responsible investment or SRI trend has a lot further to go than the headlines and industry attention would suggest.\n\n\u201cInvesting in a simple index fund is immoral,\u201d says Matt Patsky, CEO of socially responsible investment company Trillium. He says people are routinely shocked when he uses that word to refer to ordinary mutual funds, but he is sticking with it.\n\nIndex funds invest passively across the board, he says. They make no ethical distinctions between companies based on how they act. He urges those \u201cwith a conscience\u201d to move their dollars to funds that incorporate ethical screens.\n\nSocially responsible funds take account of various social factors before choosing whether to invest in a company. Some activist funds invest in companies they consider bad actors to pressure the management to change. Others avoid investing in certain companies, whether it be tobacco stocks, or defense contractors, or fossil fuel companies.\n\nSome argue that if you sell stocks in companies you dislike, you just leave the profits to somebody else. Patsky argues that this policy of divestment works over time, by making it harder for those companies to raise money and raising their cost of capital. He adds that \u201csocially responsible investing\u201d has also produced higher returns with lower volatility than passive investing.\n\nOne good reason of late: The energy sector has been a terrible performer. In the past 10 years the S&P 500 Energy sector SP500.10, +0.00% has produced total returns of just 44%. The broader S&P 500 SPX, -0.53% : 242%.
