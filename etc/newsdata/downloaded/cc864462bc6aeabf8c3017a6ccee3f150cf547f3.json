At least not in corporeal form. He is apparently a figment of Navarro\u2019s imagination \u2014 an anagram of Navarro\u2019s surname that the trade adviser created as a Hitchcockian writing device and stuck with as something of an inside joke with himself.\n\nNavarro\u2019s imaginary source surfaced this week when The Chronicle of Higher Education published some of the findings of Tessa Morris-Suzuki, an emeritus professor at Australian National University.\n\nMorris-Suzuki, concerned about Navarro\u2019s statements on China, started digging into his earlier work. She unearthed about a dozen instances when Navarro, previously a business school professor at the University of California, Irvine, had invoked Ron Vara. Curious why she could find no record of such a person, she soon discovered he was not real.\n\nPeter Navarro, a China hawk and top trade adviser to President Donald Trump, walks to the West Wing of the White House in Washington, June 5, 2019. (Erin Schaff/The New York Times) More\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a very strange thing for an academic to do in books that he is presenting as factual,\u201d Morris-Suzuki said in an email. \u201cIt might be different if a writer \u2014 even a university-based one \u2014 were writing something that was obviously lighthearted and comical and in a nonacademic context.\u201d\n\nNavarro holds a doctorate in economics from Harvard University. His interests shifted from utility regulation to investment strategy before he latched on to China, becoming a notorious hawk whose anti-China screeds like his book and documentary film \u201cDeath by China\u201d caught the eye of Trump.\n\nRon Vara first appeared in Navarro\u2019s 2001 book, \u201cIf It\u2019s Raining in Brazil, Buy Starbucks.\u201d He was described as a Gulf War reservist who, like Navarro, had studied economics at Harvard.\n\nSome of Navarro\u2019s insights in that book are attributed to Ron Vara in later works, Morris-Suzuki said. For instance, Navarro advised in his 2001 book, \u201cDon\u2019t play checkers in a chess world.\u201d That same wisdom is attributed to Ron Vara in \u201cThe Well-Timed Strategy\u201d (2006) and \u201cAlways a Winner\u201d (2009).\n\nFar from an investing oracle, Ron Vara tended to offer advice in bite-size clich\u00e9s, such as \u201cRide the stock market cycle \u2014 or be run over,\u201d which appeared in Navarro\u2019s book \u201cWhen the Market Moves, Will You Be Ready?\u201d\n\nBy the time Navarro\u2019s musings turned to China, so did, naturally, those of Ron Vara. In \u201cThe Coming China Wars,\u201d a section about China\u2019s \u201cpoisoned food chain\u201d warned about toxic Chinese fish being exported to the United States. A quote from Ron Vara drove the point home: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be nuts to eat Chinese food.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeath by China,\u201d Navarro\u2019s seminal book, which he wrote with Greg Autry, used a Ron Vara quote to set up a section about how the American eagle had become the world\u2019s biggest pigeon: \u201cThe Manufacturing Dragon is voracious. The Colonial Dragon is relentless. The American Eagle is asleep at the wheel.\u201d", "description": "Peter Navarro, a top White House trade adviser, has developed a reputation in Washington as a Rasputin-like China hawk who whispers anti-China musings in President Donald Trump's ear.This week, Washington learned about the mysterious anti-China voice that has long whispered in Navarro's ear:", "authors": ["Alan Rappeport"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TUL1WC649wkpminwlRp7XQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/40854d52a426d70f9fc3a10dde4ae673", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
