The vast majority were on Chinese goods, though Trump's White House also has imposed duties on steel, aluminum, solar panels and washing machines and threatened others.\n\nThe resulting surge in costs for supplies is forcing many business owners to choose between raising prices and laying off workers, and the pain is likely to worsen, with Trump boosting tariffs on some $200 billion in goods to 30 percent after Beijing pushed back against previous duties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe trade war is already in its second year and with every escalation, the more it permanently impairs confidence,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, an economist with Bank of America. \u201cThe unpredictable nature of the trade war will keep businesses, at best, in wait-and-see mode.\u201d\n\nThat outlook jibes with the assessments of manufacturers, retailers and some lawmakers who have long warned that the White House risks undermining growth from a 2017 tax cut with the duties, which Trump says are a useful tool in forcing concessions from China.\n\nThe country has taken advantage of the U.S. for decades, the president has said repeatedly, and hurting its exports with tariffs will ultimately yield a trade deal that allows American companies broader access to the world\u2019s second-largest economy and ends Beijing\u2019s appropriation of trade secrets as a condition of doing business in the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a great position,\u201d Trump said at the G-7 summit in Biarritz in late August. \u201cIf they don\u2019t make a deal, it\u2019s going to be very bad for China.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Hardwood Federation, a Washington-based trade group representing the $210 billion industry, are eager for such an agreement, though they believe it will still take considerable time to rebuild the ground they have lost in China, president Dana Cole told FOX Business.\n\nWhile a swath of companies have complained about the difficulty of developing and maintaining supply chains -- a process that often takes years -- when they\u2019re uncertain which countries might be affected by future U.S. tariffs, the situation is even more complicated for hardwood firms.\n\nThe industry is agricultural, Cole explained, but relies on a crop that can take 30 years to mature as opposed to a single growing season.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t know what the prices are going to be, what the tariffs are going to be,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know when to buy, and when people are going to be willing to sell.\u201d\n\nDeliveries of red oak and cherry wood \u00ad\u2013 which were popular with Chinese consumers \u2013 dropped 36 percent and 28 percent, respectively, in the first six months of this year amid Beijing\u2019s retaliatory tariffs.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, people will say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you find different markets for these types of wood that China\u2019s not buying?\u2019\u201d Cole said. The answer is that there are none large enough to absorb such quantities.\n\nAcross all industries, U.S. shipments to China have sunk by $615 million since the trade war began, according to Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, whose supporters include the National Retail Federation and the Consumer Technology Association.\n\nThroughout, executives have chafed under the White House\u2019s insistence that China is paying for the tariffs. The decline in value of the yuan doesn\u2019t come close to making up for the duties, they say, which American importers must pay to customs officials when goods arrive in U.S. ports.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe levies paid in July, which were the highest in U.S. history, rose 62 percent from the year before, according to Tariffs Hurt the Heartland.\n\nLearning of changes via 280-character Twitter posts from the president made the changes even confusing for some businesses, since administration offices weren't always up to speed and couldn't answer questions such as whether effective dates applied to shipments already in transit.\n\n\u201cThese historic tariff increases are what\u2019s causing significant uncertainty for American employers, leading to less investment, higher prices and fewer job opportunities,\u201d Tariffs Hurt the Heartland spokesman Jonathan Gold said. \u201cYou can\u2019t budget for a double-digit tariff increase, and you can\u2019t plan a business when you\u2019re living tweet-by-tweet. .\u201d", "description": "The resulting surge in costs for supplies is forcing many business owners to choose between raising prices and laying off workers.", "authors": ["James Langford"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/port-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
