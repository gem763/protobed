The procedures are to be conducted by a disciplinary chamber made up of judges chosen by the National Council of the Judiciary, a body picked by the parliament in which PiS has an absolute majority.\n\nThe minister of justice, Zbigniew Ziobro, who is also the chief prosecutor, has enormous influence over the disciplinary procedures.\n\nThe Commission addressed its worries to Warsaw, but said that the Polish government's explanations \"did not alleviate the legal concerns.\"\n\nThis is the third case filed by the Commission against Poland to the CJEU. It also referred a law forcing Supreme Court judges into early retirement (the EU court found it was illegal) and another one on retirement provisions for ordinary judges.\n\nThe Commission has also launched an Article 7 procedure against Poland over concerns that it is violating the EU's democratic standards.\n\nThe Polish government insists it is simply cleaning out judges with ties to the communist regime that ended in 1989 and making the judicial system more efficient.\n\nThe tensions between Brussels and Warsaw are unlikely to subside if PiS remains in power after Sunday's vote.\n\nJaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the leader of PiS and Poland's de facto ruler, admitted earlier this week in an interview with Polsat television that there had been \"difficulties\" in pushing through legal reforms, although he insisted that the government hadn't violated the Polish constitution. He promised even deeper changes to the legal system in the future.\n\n\"If society trusts us, we will return to this,\" he said, adding, \"Repairing the country is difficult without a deep reform of the courts, because they are in a way the final barricade, the last decision-making level in many issues \u2014 civil, criminal and administrative.\"", "description": "The Commission worries that the government is undermining judicial independence.", "authors": ["Jan Cienski", "Zosia Wanat"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/h_54832090-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
