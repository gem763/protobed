you go to a Snakehead to say you want to be trafficked to an economic opportunity and usually you'll borrow quite a significant amount of money,\" he said.\n\nBelgian officials said the trailer arrived at Zeebrugge at 2.49pm on Tuesday and left the port the same day en route to Purfleet.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nJoachim Coens, chief executive of Zeebrugge port, said it was unlikely people were loaded into the container at the Belgian site, while mayor Dirk De Fauw, who is also the chairman of the port, said it was \"virtually impossible\" the victims went into the trailer at the Belgian border.\n\nThe trailer arrived at Purfleet at around 12.30am on Wednesday, and the front section to which it was attached, known as the tractor, came from Northern Ireland via Holyhead in north Wales on Sunday.\n\nIrish company Global Trailer Rentals Ltd (GTR) confirmed it owned the refrigerated part of the lorry and a spokesman said the company was \"shellshocked\" and \"gutted\" by the news.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: Skty News)\n\nThe firm said the trailer had been leased on October 15 from its rentals yard in Co Monaghan, in the Republic of Ireland, at a rate of 275 euro (\u00a3237) a week.\n\nIt said it provided police with information about the person and company that leased the trailer, as well as offering to make tracking data available.\n\nThree addresses have been searched in Northern Ireland as part of the probe, while warrants were also carried out in Cheshire.\n\nChina has called for joint efforts to counter human smuggling, while vigils have been held in London and Belfast to pay tribute to the victims.", "description": "Joanna Maher, 38, and her\u00a0husband Thomas, also 38, from Warrington, were arrested today in connection with the deaths of 39 migrants in a lorry container in Grays, Essex", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Facebook", "Peter Powell", "Pa", "Skty News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20724591.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-25-at-161548JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
