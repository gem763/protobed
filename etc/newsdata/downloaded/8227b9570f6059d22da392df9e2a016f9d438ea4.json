(Scott Taetsch/Getty Images)\n\nA few weeks ago, the Miami Dolphins appeared to be alone in their quest to become one of the worst teams in NFL history. Not anymore. The winless Washington Redskins just fired their head coach. The winless Cincinnati Bengals have a stalling offense. And the New York Jets, still without a win, have joined the Dolphins in the cellar of the AFC East.\n\nThe Redskins and Dolphins will meet at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday, giving one of those teams a first victory (unless they manage to tie), but there won\u2019t be many other bright spots on the docket this season for those two ailing franchises.\n\nHowever, finishing with one of the NFL\u2019s two worst records this season has one huge benefit: the option to select either Alabama\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa or Oregon\u2019s Justin Herbert, two highly coveted college quarterbacks, in the 2020 NFL draft.\n\n[Bill Callahan wants the Redskins to focus on the run. It won\u2019t help.]\n\nTagovailoa came off the bench to lead Alabama to a national title as a true freshman in 2018 and is the top-ranked quarterback in college football this season, according to the game charters at Pro Football Focus. Herbert, meanwhile, has one of the highest adjusted completion rates of 2019 (81 percent, fourth highest), and is reportedly preferred by some pro scouts.\n\nDespite their upstart challengers, the Dolphins still have the inside track for the top spot. Based on their true talent level \u2014 derived by looking at actual win rate, projected win rate based on total points scored and allowed, and a regressed win rate that accounts for the small sample size of four or five games \u2014 we can project the season 1,000 times and find that the Dolphins are most likely to finish the 2019 campaign with three wins or fewer. Using that projection model, they also have the highest chance among all NFL teams to go 0-16 this year (eight percent), well above the Redskins and Bengals.\n\nMiami\u2019s deficiencies appear irreparable, at least this season. The Dolphins are scoring a paltry 0.6 points per drive and converting just 17 percent of their red-zone opportunities into touchdowns (the league average is 55 percent). Their defense is allowing a league-high 3.5 points per drive, with a whopping 75 percent red-zone efficiency rate. They are, in short, a complete disaster on both sides of the field. As a result, we would expect them to finish with the league\u2019s worst record -- and the No. 1 pick -- in almost half of our simulations (42 percent).\n\n[Falcons Coach Dan Quinn now has the NFL\u2019s hottest seat]\n\nAfter that, the race to the bottom is a virtual toss up between the Bengals and Redskins. Cincinnati is scoring just 1.5 points per drive, fifth lowest in the league, while allowing 2.3 points per drive. Quarterback Andy Dalton is also on the decline; heading into Week 6, Dalton is one of the least-valuable passers of 2019, per ESPN\u2019s Total Quarterback Rating, with a performance only good enough to win 5 or 6 games in a 16-game season (a 35.1 QBR).\n\nFormer Redskins starting quarterback Case Keenum has battled injuries this season, but he hasn\u2019t been much better (46.2 QBR, 22nd out of 33 qualified passers). He was benched in favor of Dwayne Haskins in Week 4, and then replaced in the starting lineup by Colt McCoy last week. To be fair, Washington\u2019s passers are also navigating through the season without their Pro Bowl left tackle (Trent Williams, who is holding out) and right guard (Brandon Scherff, who is injured). They\u2019re without their presumed top running back (Derrius Guice, who is injured) and playmaking tight end (Jordan Reed, who is in the concussion protocol).\n\nThe Jets at least expect to see their starting quarterback, Sam Darnold, back on the field this weekend after he missed the last three games due to mononucleosis. Darnold completed more than 68 percent of his passes in New York\u2019s season opener before being sidelined.\n\nAt the very least, we can likely pencil in Miami for one of the two top draft spots. The race for the No. 2 pick appears close, but Washington is the leader in the clubhouse, even if you think the Redskins will beat the Dolphins this weekend.\n\nConfidence in that, incidentally, is waning among the oddsmakers. The early line for this game opened with Washington as a 6\u00bd-point favorite, a number that has since been bet down to 3\u00bd points. That corresponds to a drop in implied win rate from 70 percent to 60 percent.\n\nAfter the trip to Miami, the Redskins host the undefeated San Francisco 49ers (coached by former Redskins assistant Kyle Shanahan) before playing the Minnesota Vikings (3-2) and Buffalo Bills (4-1) in back-to-back road games. Maybe they get a win or two after their bye, with home games against the Jets and Detroit Lions followed by a road game at the Carolina Panthers in Week 13. But then they close the season with games against the Packers in Green Bay, the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants at home, and then the Cowboys in Dallas. That is, by far, the most challenging remaining schedule among the league\u2019s worst teams. Against that slate of games, we can expect the Redskins to finish 4-12 or worse.\n\nAnd so, even with the winless Dolphins looming, the Redskins have the second-best chance at landing either Tagovailoa or Herbert.\n\nRead more on the NFL from The Post:\n\nAnalysis: Kyle Shanahan is getting it done in San Francisco, adding to the Redskins\u2019 embarrassment\n\nRichard Sherman calls out Baker Mayfield for \u2018bush league\u2019 handshake snub\n\nNFL power rankings Week 6: Saints move up to No. 2 and the Chiefs fall\n\nWho will be the Redskins\u2019 next coach?
