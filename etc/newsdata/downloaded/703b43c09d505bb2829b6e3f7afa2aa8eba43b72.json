But even they were surprised by the searing temperatures that greet their arrival in the Far East, which has seen temperatures of well above 30 degrees Celsius feel even hotter with the lack of wind and high humidity, with Japan\u2019s baking summer lasting longer than usual.\n\nIn contrast to that, New Zealand and Ireland have based themselves near Tokyo in central Japan, where the humidity is not quite so bad even in the hot temperatures that have struck the city this year.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The players feel like they've adapted to the environment as well as they can and now they're ready to begin the serious preparation for the World Cup.\u201d\n\nAfter three days of conditioning that Jones described as something akin to a pre-season programme, the squad will be put through their paces in their first full training session on Saturday afternoon.\n\nEngland captain Owen Farrell believes that the work the squad put in during their two summer camps in Treviso will put them in good stead to make the most of the broiling conditions, backing up Jones\u2019s claim that they will be better prepared than their World Cup opponents.\n\n\u201cIt's humid,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cWe haven't trained too much in it yet. We did a lot of preparation in Treviso which was also very humid, so we feel like we've built up a decent base before coming to Japan. We've expected it about training here and playing in our first Test.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the extremely hot weather, the Australian has been delighted with how the squad have settled in Miyazaki, having endured a disrupted start to the campaign after finding themselves on the end of a five-hour delay upon their arrival in Tokyo. The after-effects of last weekend\u2019s Typhoon Faxai caused travel chaos across the capital city that meant the team bus was unable to make its way to Narita International, though their journey down to Miyazaki the following day was far smoother.\n\n\u201cThe first part of the World Cup is always dependent on your travel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a vigorous travel schedule, but we've settled in well now and have got used to the conditions. Players have been out and about a bit. We've deliberately had quite an easy training week but we'll increase that starting today.\n\nDespite Jones\u2019s obvious connections with the nation through his Japanese mother and historic 2015 victory as head coach of the Brave Blossoms over the Springboks, he does not believe that England will be adopted as the locals\u2019 second team over the next seven weeks \u2013 but does hope that any they do receive could give them an added advantage.\n\n\u201cThe Japanese love the All Blacks and that isn't going to change, but I'm sure we'll get our fair share of support,\u201d Jones added. \u201cOur sponsor Canterbury must be so happy about the number of English jerseys we've seen in Miyazaki, it's been quite incredible.\n\n\u201cWe'll get some good support and it will make a difference because as you know Japanese rugby crowds can be quite quiet so if we've got a number of people supporting us, it could make a difference.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones believes England\u2019s pre-Rugby World Cup training camp in Miyazaki will give them an early advantage over their rivals, having begun their Japanese campaign in extreme humidity and sweltering heat.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/14/07/eddie-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
