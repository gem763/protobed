However, the business faces intense competition from Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill said Microsoft\u2019s results \u201cwere strong across the board with nearly all key metrics beating consensus.\u201d\n\nBut Azure was the key metric that missed slightly, said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company.\n\n\u201cAzure came in at 59 per cent (revenue growth) and consensus was at 60 per cent,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than that, it was a good quarter, but if you want to throw rocks at it, that is how you would do it.\u201d\n\nWorldwide spending on cloud infrastructure services grew nearly 38 per cent year-on-year in the calendar second quarter to US$26.3 billion, according to data from research firm Canalys. Amazon Web Services still dominates the market with a 31.5 per cent share, followed by Microsoft with 18.1 per cent.\n\nMicrosoft shares, up 34 per cent for the year, were 0.25 per cent lower at US$136.90 in after-market trading.\n\nThe technology company\u2019s personal computing division accounted for the largest share of its revenue, rising four per cent to US$11.13 billion. The unit includes Windows software, Xbox gaming consoles, online search advertising and Surface personal computers.\n\nWindows results were boosted by 19 per cent revenue growth for business computers, which was offset by a seven per cent decline for consumer PCs.\n\nMike Spencer, head of investor relations for Microsoft, said Google Chromebooks continued eat into Windows revenue for entry-level laptops.\n\nNet income rose 21 per cent to US$10.68 billion, or $1.38 per share, while total revenue rose 14 per cent to US$33.06 billion.\n\nAnalysts had expected a profit of $1.25 per share on revenue of US$32.23 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "Azure revenue up a strong 59 per cent, but that's a considerable slump from last year's 76 per cent gain", "authors": ["Noor Zainab Hussain", "Stephen Nellis"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/microsoft.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
