Republicans, meanwhile, did not want to entertain questions about the contents of the report, though some urged caution and admitted the allegations were concerning.\n\n\"I found the allegations deeply disturbing. I also found them very credible,\" Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff said after reading the report. He added that the complaint \"was an urgent matter and is an urgent matter.\"\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., said he found the complaint to be \"well-written\" and called it a \"travesty\" that it was withheld from Congress for so long, as it was filed Aug. 12. He would not detail the contents of the complaint, nor the subject of it.\n\nThroughout Tuesday afternoon, members of the House Intelligence Committee descended down a spiral, marble staircase one-by-one to view the whistleblower complaint. They viewed the document in a private room located behind two oak doors marked with red signs reading \u201cRestricted Area.\"\n\nSenators on the Intelligence Committee gathered around the same time in a room in the basement of the Capitol. After reading the complaint, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and a member of the committee, said there were perhaps \"two conflicting views\" of the report within the intelligence community and he was \"looking forward\" to hearing from both the acting intelligence chief and its watchdog on Thursday.\n\n\"There was a classified and unclassified portion,\" he said, not elaborating on the length or contents of the complaint. Blunt said his level of concern was unchanged after reading the report. \"It\u2019s no higher than it was before.\"\n\nMore: 'I would like you to do us a favor.'

Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., told reporters after viewing the complaint \"there's obviously lots that's very troubling there.\"\n\nHe said both Democrats and his Republican colleagues needed to slow down and refrain from playing politics.\n\n\"Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons to say there's no there there when there's obviously lots that's very troubling there,\" Sasse said. He added that the Trump administration shouldn't be \"attacking the whistleblower as some talking points suggest\" they would.\n\nThe anonymous whistleblower complaint from an intelligence official, which was initially withheld from Congress by acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, is at the center of the worsening scandal involving Trump's interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Maguire argued that the complaint did not address concerns of a member of the intelligence community so disclosing it to Congress was not required, even though the intelligence community's Inspector General Michael Atkinson found the complaint to be urgent.\n\nDemocrats have accused the president of abusing his power by pressuring Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, during a July phone call with Zelensky. The allegations spurred House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to officially announce the House would pursue an inquiry into the impeachment of Trump, uniting her caucus after months of investigations into the president.\n\nWhile Democrats and Republicans have disagreed on such a move, members of both parties agreed the complaint should be made available to the public.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speak during a meeting in New York on September 25, 2019, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.
