Some readers have retained access, while still others are seeing periodic outages on Cointelegraph\u2019s site, suggesting that not all ISPs have fully implemented the updated XML file.\n\nFor its part, Roskomnadzor and regulators at large have not provided an explanation as to why they recently decided to enforce the block on Cointelegraph, but it follows a general trend of a more assertive internet censorship policy.\n\nOther blocks from Roskomnadzor\n\nIn April of last year, Roskomnadzor took issue with encrypted messaging application Telegram, blocking 20 million IP addresses in the Russian Federation in an effort to stamp out use of the app. Those efforts were largely regarded as unsuccessful.\n\nJohann Bihr explained to Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cSince their largely failed Telegram blocking last year, the Russian authorities have been actively working to enhance their online censorship system. A major turning point was the \u2018Sovereign Internet\u2019 law signed by President Putin on 1 May, which is taking Russia much closer to the Chinese model. This law will be implemented gradually from 1 November onwards, and Roskomnadzor has been installing and testing these new tools in the past few months.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Roskomnadzor blocked seven websites involved in crypto, including bitcoin.org.\n\nA 2016 ruling against storage of Russian citizens\u2019 data outside of the country led to a Roskomnadzor block on LinkedIn that continues to this day.", "description": "Russian regulator Roskomnadzor institutes a block on Cointelegraph\u2019s website in the Russian Federation", "authors": ["Kollen Post"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9mNGJmZWM0MWE1YjYzNjAxMGZhMGYxY2YwMjA5MmEyMS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
