I don't want to speak, I want to show by action.\n\n'I don't care who is coming up. Our actions have to speak.\n\n'We never want to be in this position again or anywhere near it. We have to get back up and make sure this never happens again.\n\nThe 9-0 defeat created a list of new records and was the heaviest in Southampton's 134 history\n\n'We can put quotes out, apologise and say something, but the only thing that's the real deal now is actions.\n\n'Actions that are nowhere near what they were against Leicester. We can never show our faces like this again.'\n\nSouthampton's first-team players and coaching staff will each donate one day's wages to the Saints Foundation after capitulating to the joint worst loss of the Premier League era.\n\nBoss Hasenhuttl says his team cannot dwell on the Leicester fiasco and need to concentrate 'entire energy' on Guardiola's reigning champions and League Cup holders.\n\nJamie Vardy and Ayoze Perez both went home with match balls after the thumping win\n\n'After this, no more talking from us, no more messages - the time for that is over,' he said in a message posted on the club Twitter account.\n\n'Our only focus is working towards Manchester City.\n\n'This is where we must direct our entire energy, and this is what we owe to our fans.'\n\nSaints have not won away to City for more than 15 years.\n\nTheir most recent victory came in April 2004 when a goal from James Beattie and Kevin Phillips' second-half double secured a 3-1 success over Kevin Keegan's hosts.\n\nLeft-back Ryan Bertrand begins a three-match ban following his sending off against Leicester, while full-back Cedric Soares (calf) and winger Moussa Djenepo (hip/thigh) are not expected to return.", "description": "Captain Hojbjerg has apologised and vowed to prevent a repeat of the heaviest defeat in the south coast club's 134-year history, while manager Ralph Hasenhuttl took full responsibility.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/12/20278072-0-image-a-104_1572266060728.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
