Not these First Ladies, writes PATRICK MARMION", "language": "en", "text": "Two Ladies\n\n(Bridge Theatre, London)\n\nVerdict: Two talented actors wasted\n\nRating:\n\nWhat might happen if two First Ladies were left alone at an international summit while their President husbands discussed military retaliation for a terrorist atrocity?\n\nThat\u2019s the subject of a new play by Irish writer Nancy Harris, starring theatrical powerhouse Zoe Wanamaker and Croatian beauty Zrinka Cvitesic.\n\nThe first big test of belief is the idea that the two close allies are America and France. But their respective First Ladies are even more unlikely combinations of real First Ladies. In the French corner, we have Helen (Wanamaker) who\u2019s an English journalist version of Brigitte Macron.\n\nWhat might happen if two First Ladies were left alone at an international summit while their President husbands discussed military retaliation for a terrorist atrocity?\n\nYou may need a glass of water with that, but she\u2019s also etched with traces of Cherie Blair and Hillary Clinton. To her infinite chagrin, her once puppy-dog husband has grown up to become a cheating chien.\n\nIn the American corner, we have Cvitesic as Sophia, a Croatian trophy wife to America\u2019s apparently closet-homosexual Republican President whom she bills as a religious hypocrite and vicious bully. Once again, she\u2019s an unlikely confection of Veronica Berlusconi, Carla Bruni and, most of all, Melania Trump.\n\nOn their own, each woman beggars belief. Together, as Homer Simpson might have said, they\u2019re harder to swallow than creationism.\n\nMost disappointingly, all the women seem to do is whinge about their husbands\u2019 sexual failings. Every time we get close to bigger issues, it\u2019s back to moaning about how frightful chaps are \u2014 and Cvitesic\u2019s Sophia is fitted with a horrible history to prove it. Warming to her theme, she bitterly asserts that all men want is control, before contradicting herself by claiming \u2018we have the real power\u2019. Either way, no attempt is made to debate what power means, or if it\u2019s worth holding.\n\nAt a push, Harris\u2019s play could be considered a Greek tragedy where the action takes place off stage, and those who remain on stage find themselves crushed by events.\n\nBut there\u2019s no great dilemma and no dramatic momentum.\n\nThe two women merely bicker over their relative victimhood in a race to the bottom.\n\nI don\u2019t normally think of Wanamaker as the type for playing a defeated appendage to an oafish alpha-male.\n\nIndeed, she is much more like Anne Robinson \u2014 never more so than when she snarls: \u2018Whatever happened to a knee in the balls?\u2019\n\nBut although she tries to make Helen a gutsy, clever, hardboiled hack, she describes herself nebulously as \u2018the editor of a wonderful publication\u2019.\n\nCvitesic\u2019s character is, likewise, meant to show us the resilient Wonder Woman inside the pampered Barbie doll.\n\nBut the actress, best known for her performance in the hit Irish musical Once, is reduced to spouting platitudes \u2014 including one about how wars are started by men, and suffered by women.\n\nSomeone had better tell her about the battle of the Somme et al. Unlike Anna Fleischle\u2019s bland, conference centre set design rendered in pink and cadaver green, both women are at least eminently watchable.\n\nBut to see two such fine actors working on such meagre material is a bit like using a Montblanc pen to write a shopping list.\n\nI simply couldn\u2019t fathom what director Nicholas Hytner saw in this play.\n\nIt almost reminded me of my favourite Jo Brand joke about the fastest way to a man\u2019s heart being with a bread knife, through his breast pocket. But Harris\u2019s characters don\u2019t have the wit, or courage, to talk like that.\n\nIf they\u2019d been written by a man, I fear they\u2019d be dismissed as misogynistic stereotypes.\n\nBlood Wedding (Young Vic Theatre, London)\n\nVerdict: Celtic blood ritual with nuts on top\n\nRating:\n\nYou can always count on South African director Yael Farber to lay it on thick. Here she goes again, with a supremely solemn account of Federico Garcia Lorca\u2019s 1933 drama about a Spanish peasant wedding corrupted by a blood feud. It\u2019s a world of sexual yearning and earthen symbolism, populated with savage women, macho men and \u2018horses that know where you want to go\u2019.\n\nSignificantly, Marina Carr\u2019s new version of the story sets the action in rural Ireland of an indeterminate period. Irish blarney soaked in centuries of Catholicism stands in for the rich imagery of Lorca\u2019s poetry.\n\nCarr\u2019s language, though, is much harsher. Her doom-laden turns of phrase provoke chuckles of excitement by referring to \u2018this God-forsaken hole of the fallen world\u2019, while a mother\u2019s snarl that \u2018marriage is no place for the weak\u2019 is greeted as almost light-hearted humour.\n\nYou can always count on South African director Yael Farber to lay it on thick. Here she goes again, with a supremely solemn account of Federico Garcia Lorca\u2019s 1933 drama about a Spanish peasant wedding corrupted by a blood feud\n\nIntense is too whimsical a word to catch the pagan atmosphere of religious sacrifice that pervades the Stygian gloom of Susan Hilferty\u2019s set. It\u2019s a cross between a Methodist church hall and an anatomical dissection theatre.\n\nAdd to this doomy music composed by Isobel Waller-Bridge (yes, Fleabag\u2019s sister), which supplies a primal wail for Thalissa Teixeira, who prowls the stage in a white suit as The Moon, serenading the descent into madness.\n\nSome of the acting is magnificently brutal. Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9, as the blood-sucking mother of the play\u2019s groom, is as cold as a corpse and sour as a gooseberry, while Brid Brennan, as a mouldering agent of death, vies with her for sardonic dourness.\n\nAoife Duffin, as the bride, is a slightly mousey nymphomaniac, but she\u2019s also impressively stroppy.\n\nOpposite her, Gavin Drea adds 50 shades of Poldarkian frisson as her topless lover, who gallops about the stage like a thoroughbred assisted by a trapeze.\n\nOverdone? You betcha \u2014 with nuts on top. After two hours without an interval I felt worn out. There\u2019s only so much soil worship I can take without recourse to the bar.\n\nBut spare a thought for the cast, who have to go through this eight times a week.\n\nFour shows but just one corker\n\nGlass. Kill. Bluebeard. Imp.\n\n(Royal Court, London)\n\nVerdict: A game of two halves.\n\nRating:\n\nWhat a mushy theatrical medley: a starter of three strange short plays; then, after an interval, a witty and chewy main course. Result: a totally lopsided night.\n\nThe first half of this collection of new Caryl Churchill weirdness is unforgivably odd and dull. The gentleman to my right was going through the REM cycle before we\u2019d even got halfway through \u2018Glass\u2019 \u2013 a tale of teenage anxieties and depressions from a girl made entirely of glass.\n\nWe then had \u2018Kill\u2019 \u2014 a management consultant-style God sitting on a cloud, talking us through classical myths (\u2018we like a curse\u2019); and \u2018Bluebeard\u2019s Friends\u2019 \u2014 two couples at a dinner party glibly discussing the bloody murder of a friend (\u2018he played the piano beautifully\u2019). Sounds exciting. But stripped of dramatic flair, engaging character and any kind of a coherent point, it\u2019s actually hard work.\n\nWhat a mushy theatrical medley: a starter of three strange short plays, then a witty and chewy main course. Result: a totally lopsided night\n\nThe supposedly artistic confusion is, I suspect, meant to tickle us. But the writing is stilted and the performances play like each person is trying to tell a ghost story.\n\nLouisa Harland (of Derry Girls fame) shines early on, though; and it\u2019s a relief to have Toby Jones inject a bit of actual humanity to the dialogue in Bluebeard\u2019s Friends.\n\nCircus performers distract us between each offering. It says a lot about the quality of the fare when it\u2019s blown out of the water by a woman who can just about juggle four batons.\n\nThankfully we returned after the interval to jokes, meaty characters and stirring drama. Imp, the fourth and final playlet of the night, takes us to the sitting room of two late middle-aged cousins, Toby Jones and Deborah Findlay. They snipe, with gags straight out of a Coronation Street parody. They pour love over their niece (Harland again, on fine form). But there\u2019s a brilliantly surreal and genuinely dark twist.\n\nA bottle next to Findlay\u2019s chair, she says, contains an imp: one that grants wishes, good and evil. The storyline, wandering but warm, draws you in with great naturalism \u2014 a welcome break from the surreal nightmares we\u2019d trekked through to get here.\n\nLUKE JONES\n\nOPERA\n\nCurtain up on a trio of treats at Covent Garden!\n\nBy Tully Potter\n\nWerther (Royal Opera House)\n\nRating: 5 Star Rating\n\nThis superbly natural 2004 production by Benoit Jacquot is beautifully revived, with outstanding singing from the entire cast. If conductor Edward Gardner would moderate the orchestra\u2019s volume a tad, our joy would be unalloyed.\n\nJules Massenet\u2019s masterpiece, based on Goethe\u2019s famous novel, provides one of the great tenor roles in opera. For the Peruvian star Juan Diego Florez it represents a deepening of his artistic persona, as he sings his heart out in perfect French lyric style. His arias in Acts 1 and 3 could hardly be more passionately done.\n\nThis superbly natural 2004 production by Benoit Jacquot is beautifully revived, with outstanding singing from the entire cast\n\nAmerican mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard inhabits the role of Charlotte completely, rising to tremendous heights in her Letter Scene. The other man in the tragic triangle, Albert, is sensitively sung by South African baritone Jacques Imbrailo and American soprano Heather Engebretson is ideal as Charlotte\u2019s younger sister Sophie.\n\nBritish bass Alastair Miles is luxury casting for the girls\u2019 father, other small roles are convincingly taken and the children are delightful. In the Radio 3 broadcast on November 30 you will not be able to see Charles Edwards\u2019s fine sets or Christian Gasc\u2019s period costumes, but the engineers should rectify the balance.\n\nDon Giovanni (Royal Opera House)\n\nRating:\n\nWith so many things going for it, Mozart\u2019s dramatic comedy should be a knock-out, but a patchy cast and Kasper Holten\u2019s fidgety, often silly production make for an unsettling evening.\n\nOn the plus side in this revival are the finest Don Giovanni of our time, Erwin Schrott; a terrific Donna Anna, Malin Bystrom; a nonpareil Don Ottavio, Daniel Behle; a lovely Zerlina, Louise Alder; and a sonorous Commendatore, Brindley Sherratt.\n\nBut for the second time in a row, we have a totally unfunny Leporello \u2013 from Italy, too! Making his house debut, Roberto Tagliavini is so straitlaced that his scenes with his master lack the essential contrast. Greek soprano Myrto Papatanasiu, a late replacement, is a shrill Donna Elvira and the ROH has gone to the trouble of importing an ineffectual Croatian baritone, Leon Kosavic, as Masetto.\n\nHartmut Haenchen conducts strongly but sometimes slowly, so that you have all the more time to be irritated by the production. He restores the final sextet, which should never have been cut, but it makes Holten\u2019s idiotic treatment of the finale even worse.\n\nAs Giovanni and Leporello eat their supper \u2013 with no table \u2013 the Don throws his meal away and you hear the unmistakable sound of a melamine plate hitting the floor.\n\nSee it for yourself in cinemas on October 7, repeated on the 13th.\n\nWith so many things going for it, Don Giovanni should be a knock-out, but a patchy cast and Kasper Holten\u2019s fidgety, often silly production make for an unsettling evening\n\nAgrippina (Royal Opera House)\n\nRating:\n\nStone the crows, they have delivered this masterpiece into the sticky hands of that Aussie king of kitsch, Barrie Kosky! It is a toss-up whether Handel\u2019s glorious melodies will survive the barrage of cheap gags.\n\nThat the music does come across is due to magnificent performances by American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, British soprano Lucy Crowe and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment under dynamic young Russian conductor Maxim Emelyanychev.\n\nDiDonato\u2019s scheming Agrippina dominates every scene she is in, singing with rare technique and tone. Crowe sparkles as Poppea, Gianluca Buratti as Claudio is the pick of the basses, Franco Fagiola as Nerone stands out among a crop of countertenors.\n\nRebecca Ringst\u2019s steel cage of a set needs only a fork-lift truck to transport us into the nearest warehouse.\n\nThe male characters wear boring suits and three have shaven heads \u2014 have the wigmakers gone on holiday?\n\nIt would be tedious to detail Kosky\u2019s inappropriate, offputting interventions, which do their best to detract from the main reasons for being in an opera house: singing and drama. We even have a scene change during a duet.\n\nYou can hear the opera de-Koskified on Radio 3 on October 19.
