Because, look, the Bahamas had some tremendous problems with people going to the Bahamas that weren\u2019t supposed to be there.\u201d\n\nThe president added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to allow people that weren\u2019t supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States \u2014 including some very bad people and very bad gang members.\u201d\n\nSo, shortly after Morgan said people didn\u2019t need to have documents, Trump said they did. And shortly after Morgan emphasized a quick process, Trump suggested it would need to be very thorough.\n\nThe president\u2019s comments shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. This is his default response, after all, to accepting people into the United States on humanitarian grounds. He did it during the 2016 campaign, arguing against welcoming refugees from Syria and even calling for a complete ban on Muslim immigration. When he came into office, he privately railed against a deal between the Obama administration and Australia on taking in other refugees.\n\nMore recently, this has been Trump\u2019s attitude toward asylum seekers, suggesting that gang members and even terrorists are exploiting the process to gain access to the United States.\n\nTrump emphasized Monday that, \u201cbelieve it or not,\u201d many parts of the Bahamas were not hit hard by Dorian, suggesting the humanitarian need isn\u2019t that great. The capital of Nassau and southern parts of the Bahamas sustained significantly less damage.\n\nHis comments, notably, suggest not just that some refugees are gang members but that they might pose other problems. He even seems to suggest that people might have gone to the Bahamas so they could pose as refugees to gain admission to the United States. Trump has often spoken in this manner about potential terrorists. It\u2019s not clear whether he was saying they went to the Bahamas before the hurricane or somehow got there afterward.\n\nThe Bahamas, notably, contain many people of Haitian descent -- as many as 1 in 10 residents -- and they tend to be among the island nation\u2019s poorest residents. Trump has in the past privately referred to Haiti as a \u201cshithole country\" while deriding protections for immigrants from it.\n\nOther Republicans \u2014 particularly in Florida \u2014 have taken a more compassionate tone when it comes to welcoming Bahamians. \u201cAs hundreds of thousands of Bahamians seek refuge or start to rebuild after Hurricane Dorian, we cannot have the kind of confusion that occurred last night in Freeport,\u201d Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has encouraged Trump to waive some visa requirements.", "description": "Mixed messages from the White House, again.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jW4d9qGHC7Qpro4bQ-cQwTHAwJw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6BZYCHWTHAI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
