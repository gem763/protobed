Their goal? \u2018A full belly laugh.\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nMuriel Klein and comedian Michael Piper-Younie in July 2019 (Jeneta St. Clair)\n\nAbout a year after Dani Klein Modisett moved her mother from Manhattan to an Alzheimer\u2019s care center near her Los Angeles home in 2016, she noticed that her mom, then 84, was sad and withdrawn.\n\nMuriel Klein, once the life of the party (even with her memory loss), was no longer talkative or interested in food. She kept her head down and slept a lot.\n\n\u201cI was really upset, thinking, \u2018What have I done? Why did I take her from everything she loved in Manhattan?\u2019 \u201d Modisett said.\n\nDuring a dental exam one afternoon, Modisett, an author and former stand-up comedian, tearfully told her dentist about her mother, saying she wished she could hire a comedian for her.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d her dentist replied.\n\nModisett went home and made a few calls, and soon she had hired a stand-up comedian to visit her mom eight hours a week.\n\nThe very first day, the comedian told Klein: \u201cSome days, I don\u2019t want to talk either, Muriel. When someone gets in my face, I think, \u2018[expletive], do I look like I want to talk?\u2019 \u201d\n\nKlein repeated the expletive \u2014 a Yiddish word \u2014 laughing. Then she repeated it again. She lit up.\n\n\u201cAfter that visit, my mom became more engaged and started eating and laughing again,\u201d said Modisett, who has taught comedy classes at the University of California at Los Angeles. \u201cShe felt that she was being seen.\u201d\n\nIn early 2017, realizing that other seniors with memory loss could also benefit from some slapstick and one-liners, Modisett launched Laughter on Call, an organization that pairs comedians with dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s patients. The group also puts on laughter workshops and live comedy shows at care centers.\n\n\n\nDani Klein Modisett with her mother, Muriel Klein, in Los Angeles in April 2017.

Modisett said she has gotten inquiries from memory care centers across the country.\n\nIn Los Angeles, comedian Marty Ross, 79, took up comedy 15 years ago after nearly five decades in retail.\n\n\u201cBringing laughter to seniors, especially seniors with Alzheimer\u2019s, is so heartwarming,\u201d said Ross, who lives in Santa Clarita, Calif. \u201cThe realization that many of these people don\u2019t have regular visits from family makes [it] even more special.\u201d\n\nModisett\u2019s mother now receives twice-weekly visits from Michael Piper-Younie, 40, a stand-up comedian from Los Angeles who said he has developed more empathy and patience since joining Laughter on Call.\n\n\u201cSpending time with Muriel genuinely makes me feel better about my own day-to-day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she sees me, the excitement in her face is palpable. She beams a huge smile and reaches out her hand to mine.\"\n\nFor two hours, Piper-Younie tells funny stories and makes silly faces, he said, and sometimes, he and Klein will listen to music or dance. During their time together, she never lets go of his hand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed a special bond that is beneficial for both of us,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel honored to be doing this beautiful work and to be Muriel\u2019s companion. When I get her to a full belly laugh, it really makes my heart sing.\u201d\n\n[Why this man has become internationally beloved for his dad jokes on a roadside sign]\n\nModisett said she knew it was time to move her mother to California when a friend from New York called in 2016 and said that Klein\u2019s memory loss had worsened.\n\nDiagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s in 2011, Klein initially argued with waiters and had difficulty filling out a bank deposit slip, Modisett said.\n\n\u201cAs time went on, I knew in my heart it wasn\u2019t right to leave her in Manhattan,\u201d she said.\n\nThe various caregivers and helpers were costing $15,000 to $17,000 a month, she said, and the level of help still wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nNow 87, Klein seems more at peace with herself, said Modisett. She smiles when she wakes up at her care center.\n\nCare center employees who have hired Laughter on Call comedians to put on group shows say they\u2019ve noticed changes in memory-loss residents who watch the routines.\n\n\u201cIt helps them with their health \u2014 not just the mind, but the mind, body and soul,\u201d said Juliana Rocha, director of resident engagement and a board-certified music therapist for a Silverado Alzheimer\u2019s care center in Los Angeles.\n\nEvery Friday, after two or three comedians get residents involved in interactive storytelling, the seniors seem less anxious and more focused, Rocha said.\n\n\u201cThey're smiling, they're engaging,\u201d she said. \u201cThat kind of connection helps to build brain cells and helps to slow the progression of dementia.\u201d\n\nAlthough many memory-care patients can\u2019t communicate the way they used to, the person that families and friends knew and loved is still in there, Modisett added.\n\n\u201cThrough laughter, we can start a conversation and draw those personalities out,\u201d she said. \u201cComedians in particular have the charisma, courage and fearlessness to engage someone who might be feeling confused, isolated or lonely.\u201d\n\nShe recalled a recent afternoon when a team of her comedians put on a \u201cTitanic Remembrance Day\u201d show for several dozen people with dementia.\n\n\n\nSome of Laughter on Call\u2019s comedians in August 2019. (Olivia Saperstein)\n\n\u201cAll of the residents were made shipmates, and the band started leading them in singing \u2018Amazing Grace,\u2019 \u201d Modisett said. \u201cI looked around and saw that everyone in the room was smiling and laughing, and I knew that I was witnessing something remarkable.\u201d\n\nFor that hour, she said, \u201cthere was no anxiety, stress or sadness. Only happiness.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAlabama restaurant has no prices on the menu, just a box for diners to drop in any amount they want\n\nA trailblazing professor turns 100 next month.
