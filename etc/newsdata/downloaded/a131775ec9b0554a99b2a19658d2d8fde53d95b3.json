(Scott Morgan/Reuters)\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden apologized Tuesday night for calling Bill Clinton\u2019s 1998 impeachment a \u201cpartisan lynching.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s comments were unearthed after President Trump faced criticism Tuesday for characterizing House Democrats\u2019 impeachment efforts as a \u201clynching\u201d on Twitter.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments sparked a bipartisan controversy. Senator Susan Collins (R., Maine) responded by saying \u201cthe President never should have made that comparison,\u201d while Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) called the use of the term \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) defended Trump, calling the impeachment inquiry \u201ca lynching in every sense\u201d and \u201cun-American.\u201d\n\nBiden joined in and tweeted a response to Trump, calling the president\u2019s comments \u201cdespicable.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpeachment is not \u2018lynching,\u2019 it is part of our Constitution. Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent,\u201d Biden said.\n\nLater, CNN unearthed a video from a 1998 interview with anchor Wolf Blitzer in which Biden called the potential impeachment of former President Bill Clinton \u201ca partisan lynching.\u201d\n\nAfter the Biden campaign initially declined to comment, Biden tweeted an apology before pivoting to attack Trump, saying \u201cThis wasn\u2019t the right word to use and I\u2019m sorry about that. Trump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily.\u201d", "description": "Biden\u2019s comments were unearthed after President Trump faced criticism for characterizing House Democrats' impeachment efforts as a \"lynching\" on Twitter.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
