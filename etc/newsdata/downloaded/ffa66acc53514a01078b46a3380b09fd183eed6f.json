With these traits, we can always push ourselves to do more \u00ad\u2013 or so the thinking goes.\n\nResearch on working hours, however, suggests that overwork leads to being less productive, not more. It is also associated with increases in cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other negative health effects, all of which can take a toll on work-related output.\n\nSo how many working hours is too many? And by how much does productivity drop after a certain point? The only way to know is to measure the output of real workers. A 2015 analysis of unusual worker data from World War One can offer some concrete answers.\n\nSweet spot?\n\nDuring the war, Britain needed to manufacture weapons and ammunition quickly. Because so many men were off fighting, women \u2013 who had not typically worked in factories at the time \u2013 were called into service as \"munitionettes\".
