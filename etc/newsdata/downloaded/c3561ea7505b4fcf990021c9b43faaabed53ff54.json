I hope the @NBA can learn from that courage and not abandon those values for the sake of their bottom line,\u201d McConnell wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe people of Hong Kong have risked much more than money to defend their freedom of expression, human rights, and autonomy. I hope the @NBA can learn from that courage and not abandon those values for the sake of their bottom line. \u2014 Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) October 8, 2019\n\nMcConnell\u2019s condemnation is especially significant not only because he is one of Washington\u2019s most powerful lawmakers, but because his wife, Elaine Chao, who serves as Trump\u2019s Transportation Secretary, is Chinese-American. As senior Breitbart News contributor Peter Schweizer writes in his #1 New York Times bestselling book Secret Empires, McConnell and Chao\u2019s financial ties to China run deep. Notably, the couple has received between $5 million to $25 million from her Chao\u2019s father, James Chao, whose shipping firm, Foremost Group, has done business with the Chinese government.\n\nHouston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey set off a firestorm over his deleted tweet in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nA short time after Morey posted that statement, the NBA said it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that the deleted tweet offended many in China. And all that followed several companies in China, including some of the NBA\u2019s major business partners there, lashing out over Morey\u2019s original tweet.\n\nMorey tweeted an image that read \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d referring to the four-month-old protests in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. That led to Houston owner Tilman Fertitta turning to Twitter to say that Morey does not speak for the Rockets, and sparking an outcry that included the Chinese Basketball Association \u2014 whose president is Yao Ming, the former Rockets star center \u2014 saying it was suspending its relationship with the team.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d Morey wrote on Twitter Monday. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\n\n2/ I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\n\u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA,\u201d he added.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) on Monday sent a letter to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver blasting the league\u2019s apology to the Chinese government and demanded it cancels its upcoming exhibition games in the country.\n\n\u201cI write today to express my disgust about the position of the National Basketball Association (NBA) with respect to Hong Kong and the freedom of the Chinese people. Doing business in China is one thing, but for the NBA to kowtow to the demands of one of the world\u2019s most brutal regimes in the pursuit of profit is, frankly, revolting. You know better. And the people of this country deserve better,\u201d the senator wrote.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) joined the chorus of lawmakers condemning the NBA for apologizing to China.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-631479342-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
