Sometimes you have to hold your hands up to the opposition. We had our own opportunities as well.\u201d", "description": "Burnley substitute Jeff Hendrick grabbed a 90th minute equaliser as the visitors held Brighton & Hove Albion to a 1-1 draw at the Amex Stadium in the Premier League on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429834766&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0KB", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
