An electioneering stunt rather than a budget to rebuild our stalling economy and reset the direction of our country,' the top Labour MP said.\n\nEarlier this year, Javid revealed the biggest increase in day-to-day public spending in 15 years\n\nIn a short speech earlier this year, Javid announced the biggest increase in day-to-day public spending in 15 years and implied he is prepared to borrow more in the future to take advantage of record-low borrowing costs.\n\nThrough a decade of austerity, Britain has shrunk its budget deficit from almost 10 per cent of GDP to just under 2 per cent now.\n\nPublic debt has more than doubled since before the financial crisis to more than 80 per cent of GDP.", "description": "Chancellor Sajid Javid revealed on Monday that he plans to deliver Britain's first post-Brexit budget statement on 6th November - just a few days after the deadline for leaving.", "authors": ["Emily Hardy For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
