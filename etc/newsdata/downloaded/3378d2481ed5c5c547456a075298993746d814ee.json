They add to tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports from the E.U. in place since 2018.\n\nThe U.S. is the E.U.\u2019s biggest export market for food and drink, with 16% of all exports flowing there.\n\nThe E.U. responded by saying it would impose its own tariffs \u201cin due course\u201d on the U.S. airplane manufacturer Boeing.\n\nHere are some products targeted by the new tariffs\n\nThe list of products released by the U.S. Trade Representative runs to 20 pages, and includes very specific descriptions of products targeted. Here is a generalized list of some of them. All tariffs are 25% and apply to the whole E.U. except where otherwise specified:\n\nSingle-malt whiskies from Scotland and Ireland\n\nAirplanes heavier than 30,000 kg (10%)\n\nMen\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing from the U.K.\n\nDairy products, including butter, yogurt, and cheeses including parmesan\n\nFruit, including fresh fruit, dried fruit and fruit juice\n\nPork, including prepared or preserved pork\n\nOlives and olive oil from France, Germany, Spain and the U.K.\n\nWine from France, Germany, Spain and the U.K.\n\nMussels and clams\n\nCoffee\u2014including decaf\u2014from Germany\n\nMetal tools, including pneumatic hand tools, from Germany\n\nBooks from Germany and the U.K.\n\nBiscuits, waffles and wafers from Germany and the U.K.\n\nClothing and bed linen from the U.K.\n\nThe U.K. is scheduled to leave the E.U. on Oct. 31, but because each country is named individually in the Trade Representative\u2019s notice, the tariffs will continue to apply.\n\nWhy did Trump impose the tariffs?\n\nThe new tariffs stem from a 15-year-old case that concluded earlier this month when the World Trade Organization ruled that the U.S. could attempt to recoup damages of $7.5 billion stemming from what it called unfair state subsidies given to airplane manufacturer Airbus by the E.U.\n\n\u201cImposing tariffs on each other serves nobody\u2019s long term interest,\u201d the E.U. trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said in a statement announcing retaliatory tariffs. She called for the U.S. and the E.U. to sit down and negotiate a \u201cbalanced and compliant\u201d settlement.\n\nThe tariffs hit only a small fraction of the total trade between the U.S. and the E.U.; the total value of E.U. goods imported by the U.S. last year was $688 billion.\n\nBut they\u2019re just the latest in an escalation of transatlantic tit-for-tat taxes. After Trump imposed the tariffs on steel and aluminum in 2018, the E.U. laid down a 25% tariff on some U.S. exports including bourbon whiskey.\n\nOn Friday, a group of 15 spirits associations from the U.S. and E.U. called for an immediate end to all the current tariffs, saying they could cost as many as 8,000 jobs in the U.S. alcohol sector. \u201cSince the E.U.\u2019s imposition of tariffs, American Whiskey exports to the EU have decreased nearly 21%,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cOur industries are collateral damage in trade disputes that have nothing to do with the beverage alcohol sector.\u201d", "description": "President Trump imposed some $7.5 billion worth of tariffs on E.U. goods including Scotch whisky, French wine and Italian cheeses.", "authors": ["Billy Perrigo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hlWG6d8KESSaLxn7LpZnlg--~B/aD0xMzg4O3c9MjE1OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/f677c4a0e8bab71c9e67a7498ac59d15", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
