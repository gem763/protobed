The goal is to see that those who were harmed by the strict \u201cwar on drugs\u201d policies of the past can now benefit from the money made in the marijuana business.\n\n\u201cWe need to not only end the prohibition on marijuana, but also repair the damage done to the communities of color disproportionately locked up in our criminal justice system or locked out of opportunity because of the War on Drugs,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in a statement.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s tax would seek to fund a monthly grant program he\u2019s calling the \u201cdrug war justice grant,\u201d which would be given to people who were incarcerated for marijuana offenses for a period of time based on how long they were in prison. The tax money would also support substance abuse treatment programs and assist those affected by marijuana laws with housing and job support, as well as provide help for breaking into the marijuana business.\n\nMost of the Democratic primary field supports legalization of marijuana, reflecting a sea change in public opinion on the issue. Yet O\u2019Rourke goes even further, joining Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) in calling for those convicted of marijuana possession to have their criminal records expunged.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan would also no longer allow marijuana charges to be considered grounds for denying citizenship or deporting immigrants.\n\nThe presidential candidate regularly talks about legalization on the campaign trail. O\u2019Rourke publicly supported decriminalizing marijuana long before it was considered politically advantageous. As an El Paso city councilor in 2009, he sponsored a resolution calling on Congress to have a debate about legalizing narcotics, and later wrote a book with a fellow councilor explaining their support for marijuana legalization through the lens of living across the border from Juarez, Mexico.", "description": "O\u2019Rourke would give out \u201cdrug war justice grants\u201d to former prisoners arrested on nonviolent marijuana charges.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/M6lENX2-FfmhPysMHFAOAOcoQi4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KZZ5SDG2PMI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
