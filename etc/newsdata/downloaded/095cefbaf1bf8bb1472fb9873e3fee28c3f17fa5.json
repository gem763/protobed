There\u2019s some good, and there\u2019s some stuff we\u2019ve got to get cleaned up.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys piled up 494 yards, including 405 yards passing and a career-high four touchdowns by Prescott. Dallas scored touchdowns on five consecutive drives, all of them at least 75 yards, and led 35-10 early in the second half.\n\nNew York did finish with 470 yards, but was 2 of 11 on third downs and lost two fumbles - Manning had one on a fourth-down play inside the Dallas 10 late in the third quarter, and Jones had the ball knocked loose when he was scrambling for a first on his only drive after the two-minute warning.\n\n\u201cWe moved the ball well, did a lot of good things, just didn\u2019t play well enough, and just keep up with what Dallas was doing,\u201d Manning said. \u201cAnd the second half kind of got out of hand.\u201d\n\nWhen New York won the first regular-season game the Cowboys played in their showplace stadium in 2009, a then-28-year-old Manning supposedly left his signature on the wall, noting the score (33-31) along with the fact that it was the first game there.\n\nThat was the start of the second season after Manning\u2019s first Super Bowl title with New York, and two years before he got another one during the 2011 season. The Giants have been to the playoffs only once since then, and have an 8-25 record since the start of 2017.\n\nJones was the NFL\u2019s leading passer in the preseason with a 137.3 passer rating (29 of 34 for 416 yards and two touchdowns) while the Giants won all of those games.\n\n\u201cJust it being a regular-season game has a different feel to it. I think the circumstance in the game also felt a lot different,\u201d Jones said. \u201cStill exciting to run out there.\u201d\n\nWhile Jones was the holder on kicks, his first regular-season snaps at quarterback came with 1:46 remaining, which Shurmur called \u201can obvious situation\u201d to get him in the game. The kid from Duke completed three short passes for 17 yards before his first incompletion, then fumbled when pushing forward for first-down yardage on a third-and-4 play.\n\n\u201cYou can see he\u2019s a competitive guy. He\u2019ll learn to run out of bounds. In his mind, he competes and he said I wanted to guarantee we got the first. You\u2019ve just got to secure the ball,\u201d Shurmur said. \u201cFor the rest of it, I felt like it was important to get him some work.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A decade after a signature victory for Eli Manning in the same building, the writing on the wall will only get more pronounced for the two-time Super Bowl MVP quarterback with each loss the New York Giants have like their opener.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Hawkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/giants_cowboys_football_87237_c0-204-4630-2903_s1770x1032.jpg?3a21cbcb2e0c12d3f5ba319aaacef302cc3617ee", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
