Especially in important games for Juventus. And I also played well there,\" he said. \"I haven't had a chance this season.\n\n\"But now I think, when I come back to the club, I will get chances again.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"I am definitely grateful to Joachim Low.

That's why I was simply happy that I played again.\"\n\nJuventus are next in action against Bologna, seeking to extend a one-point gap at the head of Serie A.\n\nBut Can's long-term future is anything but secure, with him being mooted in numerous reports as a potential makeweight in a move from Juve for Pogba.\n\nCan has also been linked with a switch to Spain.", "description": "The German star moved to Italy in 2018 on a free transfer but is enduring a nightmare second season at the Allianz Stadium", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19122174.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Italy-Juventus-v-Genoa-CFC-Serie-A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
