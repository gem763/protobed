It also revealed how it intends to punish them should they step over the line\u2026 but it\u2019s probably not the punishment critics are hoping for.\n\nIn a new post to its blog, Twitter addressed a topic that\u2019s been the center of much controversy: how much punitive action can (or should) Twitter take against important public figures when they violate the platform rules. It pleaded for sympathy, saying \u201cWe understand the desire for our decisions to be \u201cyes/no\u201d binaries, but it\u2019s not that simple. The actions we take and policies we develop will set precedent around online speech and we owe it to the people we serve to be deliberate and considered in what we do.\u201d\n\nThere continues to be meaningful public conversation about how we think about Tweets from world leaders on our service. We welcome the conversation and want to share more context on our principles and process for reviewing Tweets from these accounts. https://t.co/UlbdUVIeV9 \u2014 Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 15, 2019\n\nSpecifically, it said that it would \u201cfocus on the language of reported Tweets and do not attempt to determine all potential interpretations of the content or its intent\u201d and that, even if the tweet violates the rules, it might still be left up if there\u2019s a \u201cclear public interest value\u201d in it.\n\nTwitter did go out of its way to say that world leaders \u201care not above our policies entirely\u201d (emphasis Twitter\u2019s), and that it would censure world leaders if they crossed very particular lines. So in order for Twitter to crack the whip, the figurative world leader would have to:\n\nPromote terrorism\n\nEngage in child sexual abuse or exploitation\n\nPromote self-harm\n\nShare intimate pictures of someone taken or distributed without the subject\u2019s consent\n\nPost private info like addresses or phone numbers\n\nUse clear and direct threats of violence against an individual\n\nThat last rule has some leeway to it. According to Twitter, \u201cdirect interactions with fellow public figures and/or commentary on political and foreign policy issues would likely not result in enforcement,\u201d and \u201cdirect interactions with fellow public figures, comments on political issues of the day, or foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues are generally not in violation of the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nStill, for all those garden-variety tweets that might violate Twitter\u2018s rules, Twitter is apparently implementing a \u201cquiet\u201d policy. According to the post, it\u2019ll put the offending tweets behind a notice letting users know what they\u2019re about to see breaks the site\u2019s rules. It also said in a follow-up tweet that \u201cyou will not be able to like, reply, share, or Retweet the Tweet in question. You will still be able to express your opinion with Retweet with Comment.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t envy the position Twitter finds itself in. It\u2019s one of the most popular spaces for public discussion in the world \u2014 and that world leaders want space to speak there too. You could just ban them, but in today\u2019s political and social climate, that seems like a foolish thing to do. As pointed out in the blog, \u201c[We] recognize that this is largely new ground and unprecedented.\n\nStill, it\u2019s odd to see that the answer to, \u201cWhat should we do when a world leader gets a little out of hand?\u201d is \u201cRestrict everyone else from reacting to them directly.\u201d\n\nWe wish them the best of luck with this method. They\u2019re going to need it once someone decides to test it.\n\nWorld Leaders on Twitter: principles & approach on Twitter", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FTwitter-Safety.jpg&signature=29e8827b86396fd3f404dce1c494e7d9", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
