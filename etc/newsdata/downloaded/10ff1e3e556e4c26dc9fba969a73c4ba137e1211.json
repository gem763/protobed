REUTERS/Annegret Hilse\n\nTwo-time defending champions New Zealand are expected to win the pool after beating South Africa in their first game and have planned to use the matches against Canada, Namibia and Italy to finetune their game ahead of the quarter-finals.\n\n\u201cWe just have to keep building combinations, keep building the attacking side of our game, keep learning about the conditions, which have influenced some of the games with the humidity,\u201d assistant coach Ian Foster said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIdeally the Canada game gives us a fantastic opportunity to grow where we\u2019re at. But for us it\u2019s also a test match so we want to go out and get a result and get a performance we want.\u201d\n\nIdeally a bonus-point victory against a side ranked 22nd in the world and who were the last to qualify for the tournament, no injuries and no-one falling foul of the disciplinary committee would be more than enough.\n\nThe match under the retractable roof at Oita Stadium, however, could see the All Blacks run up the score although lock Sam Whitelock said that was not their goal and they had to treat the game like another test match.\n\n\u201cAs All Blacks there is no such thing as tier one or tier two (teams),\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t show respect to any side then you\u2019re going to get hurt.\n\n\u201cThis week is one that we\u2019re definitely looking at ourselves, trying to get better from where we were against South Africa.\n\n\u201cThere is always something to work on.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks have their shortest turnaround in the tournament after the Canada game, having to travel to Tokyo for their clash with Namibia on Sunday and Hansen has recognized the need to juggle the team selections.\n\nHe made 11 changes from the starting side that beat South Africa on Sept. 21 and one player he will take note of is winger Rieko Ioane, who was dropped for the Bledisloe Cup match in Auckland in August.\n\nGeorge Bridge and Sevu Reece have cemented themselves as the first-choice wingers and Hansen is convinced that Ioane can return to form against Canada.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult when you are the top dog and someone comes through ... and puts you under pressure,\u201d Hansen said of Ioane, who has scored 23 tries in 26 tests and was the World Breakthrough Player of the Year in 2017.\n\n\u201cI have been impressed with him. He has been working hard and is just waiting for his opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe know that he can also play wonderful rugby. Once he does that the pressure will come back on to the selectors to pick him.\u201d", "description": "While the All Blacks are expected to run up a big score against Canada in their World Cup Pool B clash in Oita on Wednesday, Steve Hansen and his coaching staff just want to make sure they are moving forward with their game.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435758153&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF901XH-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
