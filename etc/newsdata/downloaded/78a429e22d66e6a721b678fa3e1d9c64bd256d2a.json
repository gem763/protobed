Giuliani for taking \u201cFredo to the cleaners\u201d in an interview with Mr. Cuomo.\n\nMr. Giuliani denied then admitted to Mr. Cuomo that he pushed Ukraine toward starting investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, the Democratic presidential front-runner, and his son Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t watch CNN because it is fake news, but I watched Rudy take apart Fredo,\u201d he said. \u201cFredo\u2019s performance was incompetent. The press doesn\u2019t give him credit, because they take little tiny snippets wherever Rudy was a little bit \u2014 if he mispronounces a word they\u2019ll show that, they won\u2019t show the whole. Rudy Giuliani took Fredo to the cleaners.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst time I watched CNN in a long time,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cI hate to watch because it\u2019s so fake.\u201d\n\nThe nickname Fredo comes from a video that went viral in August where the \u201cCuomo Prime Time\u201d host goes on a profanity-laced tirade after an unknown person who repeatedly referred to him as \u201cFredo.\u201d\n\nMr. Cuomo responds by saying only \u201cf\u2014ass bitches from the right call me Fredo\u201d and calling the word \u2014 which references a film character who betrays his family in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d \u2014 \u201clike the n-word for us.\u201d\n\nMr. Cuomo decried his tirade, saying in a statement he \u201cshould be better than the guys baiting me,\u201d and he \u201cshould be better than what\u201d he opposes.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
