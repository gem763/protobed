I assigned a crack team of investigators to find out what happened to it.'\n\nThe footage shows two workmen move the bin to the rear of the bin lorry, ready for it to be emptied.\n\nThe bin is then hoisted into the air but slips out of its mountings and ends up inside the lorry.\n\nThe worker with his hand on the operating button makes an exasperated hand gesture, but its too late and the bin is crushed.\n\nA number of people have commented on the footage, including Dean Sleight, who said: 'Could of hit the emergency stop that's what it's there for.'\n\nWhile Andy Folgate criticised the refuse collectors for not stopping the bin in time - and suggested a bar on the lorry could have stopped in falling in.\n\nIn the footage, the bin is hoisted into the air but slips out of its mountings and ends up inside the lorry\n\nThe worker with his hand on the operating button makes an exasperated hand gesture, but its too late and the bin is crushed\n\nOthers were more sympthatic to the refuse collectors, with one saying: 'If the bin goes in the back they're not aloud to go an retrieve it.\n\n'Its part of health an safety. If it can do that to bins imagine what it can do to bones.'\n\nWhile Kev Lid said: 'It does happen. I've worked on the bins. There's nothing you can do really. If the bucket is automatic you do have to be quick.'\n\nSpeaking today, LARP Inn owner Mr Blakeman said: 'We turned up for work and noticed the bin had disappeared. We decided to look at the CCTV and we all had a great laugh at it. It's hilarious!'\n\nMr Blakeman's contract is with Liverpool-based waste management firm Gaskells.\n\nHe added: 'I complained to Gaskells about it, then a week later I got a new bin with the invoice attached to it.\n\n'It was only \u00a310 but I decided to argue my case for not paying it.\n\n'We have been arguing about it then I mentioned that I had CCTV of what happened and then they decided to put it down as a dispute. I haven't heard a word from them since.'\n\nA spokeswoman for Gaskell Waste Services said: 'Our drivers and crew are highly professional and when an incident like this occurs they follow company procedure as they did in this case.\n\n'They immediately made us aware and we spoke to the customer regarding the delivery of a replacement container.\n\n'Our system had incorrectly generated a replacement bin delivery charge invoice which wasn\u2019t paid and was subsequently credited.'", "description": "Jamie Blakeman, who owns LARP Inn in Telford, Shropshire reviewed CCTV footage after a bin went missing from outside his shop last month.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/16/20091344-0-image-a-61_1571846181932.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
