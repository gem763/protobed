(then) maybe you want to cut rates,\" Marks told CNBC's Tanvir Gill on Thursday.\n\nBut the U.S. economy is doing \"pretty well,\" Marks said, with sources of strength which could be mostly attributed to the American consumer.\n\nWhen asked if a recession was about to his the U.S., he replied: \"It doesn't feel to me like a recession is imminent. I don't think we're going to go 5 years without it, so some time two years from now \u2014 something like that.\"\n\nCentral banks usually cut rates to get the economy going, he said, citing that the Fed's rate cuts 10 years ago helped stall global financial crisis.\n\n\"Ten years later, do you want to cut rates to extend an economic expansion which is the longest in history?\" he asked. \"I question whether that's a legitimate goal.\"\n\nIn July, the U.S. Fed cut rates for the first time since 2008, when the economy was going through the great financial crisis. July also marked the 121st month of the economic expansion since the 2008 recession, making it the longest run on record going back to 1854.\n\nThe expansion keeps trucking along, getting its latest boost from the Trump tax cut of 2018 along with an easing in business regulations, according to economists.\n\nThis week, the Fed cut interest rates again for the second time this year, despite some members voting against the cuts. Their concerns underscore a dilemma the central bank faces: While economic data in the U.S. has been stronger than expected, the Fed is also trying to trim rates in case of a slowdown triggered by external shocks, such as trade wars or Brexit.\n\nBut the work of preventing the next recession from happening isn't the Fed's job, Marks said. Traditionally, the Fed's role was to control inflation, and in the past few decades, it was to support growth so that jobs would be created, he pointed out.\n\n\"But this idea of preventing the next recession is neither of those two things, and it is a job that the Fed seems to have taken on now,\" Marks said.\n\nAs it stands, he said, while there are pockets of weakness in the U.S. economy \u2014 such as the manufacturing sector which has been hit by the U.S.-China trade war \u2014 it is still the \"best performing in the world.\"\n\n\"So I'm happy with it, and I don't think I'd be stimulating it at this point in time,\" Marks stressed.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Yun Li and Patti Domm contributed to this report.", "description": "Billionaire investor Howard Marks, the co-chairman of Oaktree Capital, predicts there won't be a recession in the U.S. for another two years.", "authors": ["Weizhen Tan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105111664-20180123-0454-2548.jpg?v=1568948954", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
