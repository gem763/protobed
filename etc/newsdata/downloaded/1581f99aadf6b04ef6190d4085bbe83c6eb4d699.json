The S&P 500 index climbed 0.6%, or 18.73 points, to 2,938.13. The Nasdaq Composite Index picked up 47.04 points, or 0.6%, to finish at 7,950.78.\n\nAt session highs, the Dow was up 257.30 points, the S&P 500 had risen 28.98 points and the Nasdaq had gained 79.1 points, all of which amounted to advances of about 1%.\n\nDespite two days of gains, the Dow has lost 0.3% week-to-date, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are on pace to post 0.5% and 0.4% weekly losses, respectively.\n\nWhat drove the stock market?\n\nTrump tweeted that (link) he would meet Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Friday to advance a trade deal, bolstering hopes that the U.S. was looking to strike a resolution soon.\n\nLiu is meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington, with the hope that the parties can resolve, at least partially, tensions over trade that have stoked anxieties on Wall Street, though it is unclear if a substantive agreement can be achieved.\n\nIf Trump's meeting with Liu takes place, it could assuage concerns among market participants who were whipsawed by conflicting overnight headlines on Thursday, including reports from the South China Morning Post suggesting that the China delegation would leave Washington on Thursday, a day earlier than had been planned. However, a White House spokesperson later told CNBC that no change of plans had occurred (link) with Beijing's representatives.\n\nBloomberg News (link) reported that the White House may implement a previously agreed upon currency deal with China ahead of schedule, and suspend tariff hikes to 30% from 25% scheduled to take effect Oct. 15 on some $250 billion in Chinese products. Those moves would be part of a first-phase agreement with China, the report said, with negotiations on critical issues such as intellectual-property rights and forced technology transfers coming at a later time.\n\nSeparately, the New York Times reported (link) Wednesday night that Trump had approved issuing licenses to some U.S. companies to conduct business with Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies. The U.S. blacklisted Huawei earlier this year, and allowing sales of non-sensitive products could help defuse trade tensions.\n\n\"If Trump and Liu He do meet, it's clearly a positive to the market,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"At this point, the market would be satisfied with the continuation of talks as long as tariffs do not increase next week. But we've had dress rehearsals for this where the meetings don't take place.\"\n\n\"Last night's headlines was reminiscent of the chaos around the Chinese delegation canceling their visit to farms in the heartland. Like then, we had different explanations for that,\" said Krosby.\n\nIn economic data, U.S. consumer price inflation was little changed in September, (link) giving the Federal Reserve room to cut interest rates in late October. Weekly jobless claims (link) fell in early October.\n\nInvestors also saw some comfort in commentary from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, who said he's (link) open-minded on the outlook for further rate cuts. The central bank has already cut its benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point this year.\n\nWhich stocks were in focus?\n\nPG&E Corp.'s stock (PCG) plunged 29.1% after a judge ruled to allow for a competitive bankruptcy plan (link), opening up the path for Elliott Management Group and other bondholders to push for their own chapter 11 plan. Their proposal would involve raising new money and using most of PG&E's equity to pay off the utility firm's debts. The utility also faced intense criticism over pre-emptive power cuts in Northern California (link), where more than 1.5 million people were without power Thursday.\n\nDelta Air Lines Inc.'s (DAL) shares fell 1.5% after profit forecasts for the fourth quarter (link) were less upbeat than expected. Still, the airline's third-quarter results beat earnings expectations.\n\nShares for Ra Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RARX) surged 101.1% after Belgian biopharma company UCB agreed to acquire the Massachusetts-based biopharma company (link)for $2.5 billion.\n\nKroger Co.'s stock (KR) retreated 2.8% after a Jefferies analyst called the grocer's tech investment into Ocado a \"misstep,\" downgrading the company to hold from buy (link).\n\nShares of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) rallied 21.6% after it announced (link) that former Target Corp. (TGT) head of merchandise Mark Tritton will take over as chief executive officer.\n\nHow did other assets trade?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed (link) 6.4 basis points to 1.649%.\n\n(link)Gold futures fell (link) after posting small gains on Wednesday. December gold was down $11.90, or 0.8% to settle at $1,501.20 an ounce.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery (link) rose 96 cents, or 1.8%, to settle at $53.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nIn Asia overnight Thursday, trade was mixed, as Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 0.1% to 25,707.93, the China CSI 300 rose 0.8% to reach 3,874.64, and Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.5% to 21,551.98. The Stoxx Europe 600, meanwhile, closed 0.7% higher to 382.76.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 10, 2019 16:21 ET (20:21 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
