At the time of writing, the Kiwi Dollar up by 0.24% to $0.6313.\n\nThe Day Ahead:\n\nFor the EUR\n\nIt\u2019s a particularly quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. With no material stats due out of the Eurozone in the day ahead.\n\nA lack of stats will leave the EUR in the hands of Brexit chatter and market risk sentiment throughout the day.\n\nFollowing softer nonfarm payroll numbers on Friday, JOLT job openings could spook the markets should quit rates slide in August.\n\nAt the time of writing, the EUR was up by 0.05% to $1.0962.\n\nFor the Pound\n\nIt\u2019s also particularly quiet day ahead on the data front, with no material stats due out of the UK to provide the Pound with direction.\n\nThe lack of stats will leave Brexit and UK politics to provide direction on the day. Barring particularly good news on the deal front, any upside for the Pound would be limited.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Pound was down by 0.03% to $1.2215.\n\nAcross the Pond\n\nIt\u2019s a relatively quiet day ahead on the economic calendar, August\u2019s JOLTs job opening figures due out of the U.S later today.\n\nWhilst the headline number will influence, following last week\u2019s NFP numbers, expect quit rates to have a greater impact on the day.\n\nA fall in openings, with a steady quit rate, would reflect stable labor market conditions that would support the Greenback.\n\nOn the geopolitical front, it\u2019s all about the trade talks with China. Expect updates from Washington and Beijing to drive the Dollar.\n\nThe Dollar Spot Index was down by 0.03% to 99.103 at the time of writing.\n\nFor the Loonie\n\nIt\u2019s a quiet day on the economic calendar.
