Your own employees appear to state that CNN is focused on trying to \u2018take down President Trump,\u2019 driven by a \u2018personal vendetta\u2019 that Mr. Zucker purportedly has against him, rather than reporting the news in an objective manner,\u201d the lawyer wrote.\n\nThe Trump re-election campaign\u2019s letter to CNN was first reported by the Washington Examiner.", "description": "The Trump campaign vows to sue CNN in the wake of undercover videos showing bias against the president inside the network.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_19227561408847-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
