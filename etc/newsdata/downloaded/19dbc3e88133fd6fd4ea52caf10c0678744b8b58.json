He spoke Thursday during an unusual, all-day \u201cmedia marathon\u201d in a Kyiv food court amid growing questions about his actions as president.\n\nZelensky, at the start of his marathon Q+A session said Trump call did not influence relations, said only aim was to secure meeting. \"We knew before that the relations were tired. They wanted to know where their cash had gone to.\" Insists no blackmail involved \u2014 Oliver Carroll (@olliecarroll) October 10, 2019\n\nTrump asked Zelenskiy during the call to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, according to a rough White House transcript. Congressional Democrats believe Trump was holding up the aid to use as leverage to pressure Ukraine and advance his domestic political interests ahead of next year\u2019s U.S. presidential election.\n\nTrump said the military aid was frozen because of concerns about corruption in Ukraine, but the move prompted congressional outcry and the money was released in September.\n\nThe July call is central to the impeachment inquiry, and embarrassed Zelenskiy because it showed him as eager to please Trump and critical of European partners.\n\nZelenskiy wouldn\u2019t say whether the Ukrainians have a different version of the transcript or whether the White House version accurately reflects the content of the leaders\u2019 conversation.\n\nZelenskiy said he thought the call would lead to an in-person meeting with Trump, and wanted the American leader to come to Ukraine. Zelenskiy said the \u201ckey question\u201d for him was to try to persuade the White House to \u201cchange its rhetoric\u201d about Ukraine as a corrupt and untrustworthy country.\n\nHe said he had \u201cseveral calls\u201d with Trump, but bristled at repeated questions about their relationship. \u201cWe are an independent country, we have relations with many countries,\u201d not just the U.S.\n\nZelenskiy is notably trying to end a five-year conflict with Russia-backed separatist in eastern Ukraine, and is treading carefully to ensure continued support from the U.S. while trying to make peace with powerful neighbor Russia.\n\nIn the July call, Trump sought help on two fronts. The first involves Trump\u2019s claims that Ukraine allied with the Democrats in a plot to derail his 2016 presidential campaign. No evidence of such a plot has emerged.\n\nAt the same time, Trump is also pushing Ukraine to investigate any potential wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Trump has said the United States has an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to ask foreign leaders to investigate corruption cases, though no one has produced evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the Bidens.", "description": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Thursday that the U.S. president had not blackmailed him during the call, which helped trigger an impeachment inquiry into Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9ef6ea210000290734372c.jpeg?cache=ek3xjauwug&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
