I mean I spent years living in fear of speaking up or saying things and I guess that's just the people pleaser in me.\n\n'And there was a huge moment where I just stopped caring and I can't tell you when that moment was, I really can't. I don't want to not express what I feel because I know there's millions of people who feel the exact same way.'\n\nSelena found fame starring on the Disney Channel series Wizards of Waverly Place in 2007 and released her debut album with the band Selena Gomez & The Scene in 2009.\n\nThe actress told how becoming well known at a young age was 'weird' for her and she also believes she 'probably hated' most of it.\n\nCareer: Selena found fame on the series Wizards of Waverly Place in 2007 and released her debut album with the band Selena Gomez & The Scene in 2009 (pictured in September 2009)\n\nShe said: 'It's more my life. It's more actually working since I was seven, being away from my family, moving from Texas to here, experiencing fame, being confused by what that means.\n\n'Trying to grow up, being in such a weird position where people are actually caring and being awkward because you're growing up. And I think I was scared of it and I probably hated most of it.\n\n'But with that time that I've been given, I've just been able to come out on the other side and be okay. And I don't really know how other than all the work that I did, meaning friends, therapy, taking time off, going back to Texas, just enjoying what's right in front of me.'\n\nSelena told the radio show how she began to feel a positive change in her life earlier this year.\n\nSelena said: 'I've been doing this for a while and I've learned very quickly that people are going to narrate your life and that's not always necessarily the best thing' (pictured in October 2019)\n\nShe said: 'I feel this huge shift. At the beginning of the year it's when it all started changing. I started seeing things differently and I just think I needed a little more braking. And then I found it.\n\n'Because you know when you're with someone and it's your best friend or they're talking about their boyfriend or their best friend or whatever, it's that exact feeling of just you got to go through it and you can't tell someone what to do. You just can't.\n\n'I had millions of people around me telling me all kinds of things and it didn't matter because it was what I wanted and I needed that.\n\n'And I feel that way about everyone in my life. You have to have that moment.

Her mom and Taylor started crying.\n\n'It wasn't because the song was emotional, it was just because the first thing they said to me was, \"We're so happy that you're here. After seeing all of that, this is such a cool moment.\" That's a huge thing for me.'\n\nPal: Selena played some of her new music for her close friend Taylor Swift who had an emotional reaction (pictured in October 2019)\n\nSpeaking about her new album, Selena said: 'I can't wait for people to hear it. I really am excited for people to hear it. I wonder what they're going to feel and think.\n\n'It's done at the end of the day, so that's all I can do with it. I think the first two songs were important for me to kind of release. And then the rest of it is very much, it's very much where I am and however that looks.\n\n'And it's actually really cool because even down to the track list and putting them in order, it actually goes really well with one another.'", "description": "Speaking to Zane Lowe on Apple Music's Beats 1, Selena, 27, told how she feels she was previously a 'people pleaser' until she had a 'huge moment' where she 'stopped caring'.", "authors": ["Sean O'Grady For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/17/20290550-0-image-a-9_1572285021643.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
