While that\u2019s down from last month, August\u2019s number was revised sharply higher to 168,000.\n\nAt the same time, though, average hourly earnings stagnated over the month, breaking a string of solid gains in recent months. They\u2019re now up only 2.9% on the year, having run north of 3% for most of 2019.\n\nIn all, the figures were enough to make market participants trim the bets on future interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which they had made earlier in the week on a succession of dire-looking business surveys.\n\nAccording to Investing.com\u2019s , the implied odds of another 25 basis-point cut at this month\u2019s Fed policy meeting retraced to 77%, after rising to nearly 87% in the aftermath of the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s monthly purchasing manager indices earlier in the week. Those had both fallen to multi-year lows.\n\n\u201cThe issue is not that the U.S. economy and labour markets are weak, but that a collapse in confidence slows activity below the economy\u2019s historically low stall speed,\u201d Lena Komileva, managing director of the G+ economics consultancy, said via Twitter. That triggers \u201ca recessionary vicious cycle in confidence, capital market (volatility) and U.S. balance sheet health.\u201d\n\nWhether this week\u2019s numbers have been enough to change the Fed\u2019s thinking about the need for further interest rate cuts may become a little clearer at 2 PM ET, when Chairman is due to speak.\n\nAmong other haven assets, fell 1.0% to $17.51 an ounce, while fell 1.4% to $882.15 an ounce.", "description": "Gold Prices Fall as Market Trims Rate Cut Bets After Jobs Data", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF410GC_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
