Gates was bombarded by people speaking on Epstein's behalf, CNBC reported.\n\nSometime afterward, Gates used one of Epstein's private planes to fly to Palm Beach, Florida, according to CNBC, where the financier was convicted of two counts of soliciting prostitution from a minor five years earlier. And a year later, emails obtained by The New Yorker show MIT Media Lab directors saying Gates was \"directed by\" Epstein to donate $2 million to the research lab.\n\nA spokesperson for Gates confirmed to Business Insider that both the tech titan and Epstein were present at a meeting \"focused on philanthropy,\" but said Epstein \"never provided services of any type to Bill.\" The spokesperson also contradicted the emails sent by MIT Media Lab directors, saying, \"Any claim that Epstein directed any programmatic or personal grantmaking for Bill Gates is completely false.\"\n\nGates' spokesperson also told CNBC that Epstein was introduced to Gates as someone who wanted to boost philanthropic spending, which was the nature of the meeting the two held with other philanthropists in 2013.\n\nGates and Jeffrey Epstein.

He died by suicide in jail in August before his trial could begin.\n\nEvidence of the apparent connection between Epstein and Gates mounted in The New Yorker's coverage of the former MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito and Epstein, which included the October 2014 email from Ito saying that Gates' donation was influenced directly by the sex offender. Ito resigned on Saturday after the article's publication.\n\nMIT recorded Gates' donation at the time but not influence from Epstein. According to The New Yorker, the lab and Ito had a quiet arrangement with Epstein. At another point, Epstein emailed Ito, saying, \"GAtes [sic] would like a write up on our one science program for tues next week.\" When Ito asked what kind of write-up, Epstein replied, \"more specofic [sic] so that he can fund.\"\n\nThe Media Lab was eventually able to secure $7.5 million from Gates and Leon Black, a high-profile investor, seemingly by way of Epstein. Gates' spokesperson denies this narrative.\n\n\"Although Epstein pursued Bill Gates aggressively, any account of a business partnership or personal relationship between the two is categorically false,\" the Gates spokesperson told Business Insider. \"Epstein never provided tax or estate services to Bill Gates.\"", "description": "A spokesperson for Bill Gates confirmed that Jeffrey Epstein \"worked aggressively\" to meet with him in 2013, a year before giving $2 million to MIT.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d76adca2e22af0458391d32-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
