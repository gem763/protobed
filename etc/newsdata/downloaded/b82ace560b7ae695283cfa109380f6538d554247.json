We deserved the three points, so disappointed...\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMoenchengladbach didn't wait too long to poke fun at the decision, tweeting a picture of character with a hand for a head along with the message: 'Too soon?'\n\nBut Scottish football fans were quick to sympathise with Smalling, with many criticising the standard of refereeing in the Scottish pyramid.\n\nOne said: \"That\u2019s the kind of sh**e we need to deal with in Scotland every week.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"Scottish refs. We get it every week.\"\n\nAnd another posted: \"Sorry Chris @ScottishFA think he\u2019s our best ref.\"\n\nVAR is not in use in this season's Europa League until the final, so there was no opportunity for the decision to be overturned.\n\nRoma still topped Group J following the draw, but only by a point from Istanbul Basaksehir with three games left.", "description": "Roma's on-loan Manchester United defender got hit in the face by the ball - and it cost his side victory", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20719986.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-EUR-C3-ROMA-MOENCHENGLADBACH.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
