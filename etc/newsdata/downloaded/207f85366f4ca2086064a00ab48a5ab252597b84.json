Lufthansa claims the union\u2019s new leadership team that took office earlier this year was not elected in a way that met legal requirements.", "description": "German flight attendants' union UFO on Sunday said it would stage an all-day strike at smaller German divisions of airline group Lufthansa in an escalating row over workers' pay and pensions.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
