Mothers rallied outside the governor's office and marched through Capitol corridors chanting \u201cNo segregation, no discrimination, yes on education for all!\" Some wore T-shirts that read \u201cFreedom Keepers.\"\n\nBut this wasn't about racial equality. In the nation's most diverse state, protesters opposed to childhood vaccine mandates \u2014 many from affluent coastal areas \u2014 had co-opted the civil rights mantle from the 1960s, insisting that their plight is comparable to what African Americans have suffered from segregationist policies.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe approach reflected the level of desperation among families staunchly opposed to vaccinating their children \u2014 a desperation that peaked Friday night when an activist threw a menstrual cup with what appeared to be blood at several state senators during floor session.\n\nBut the civil rights claim shocked lawmakers, especially those representing minority communities that have suffered generations of racism and economic injustice. Assemblywoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Los Angeles) called it \"borderline racist\" and said vaccine protesters need to revisit their history books.\n\n\u201cThis is misappropriation of a movement that really is not over and proves to be challenging to overcome,\u201d said Kamlager-Dove, a member of the California Legislative Black Caucus. \u201cThe whole conversation around vaccinations is actually one about privilege and opportunity. It\u2019s a personal choice. It's a luxury to be able to have a conversation about medical exemptions and about whether or not you think your child should be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on politics and government in the Golden State.

Four years ago, California eliminated personal belief and religious exemptions, which had long been the most common ways to avoid vaccines and still enroll children in school.\n\nNow, California was taking aim at the last option for families deeply opposed to vaccinating their children, following a wave of measles outbreaks across the country. A handful of doctors sympathetic to their beliefs had been providing waivers that allowed parents to keep their kids unvaccinated, including Robert Sears, a member of the famed Sears medical family that had dispensed pediatric advice to parents for decades.\n\nAccording to the California Department of Public Health, the number of unvaccinated children in homeschooling has skyrocketed since the state banned personal belief and religious exemptions in 2015. Students with personal belief exemptions in California schools were predominantly white and wealthy, according to a study by the American Public Health Association in 2015. Medical exemptions, intended for children with weakened immune systems, have surged since then \u2014 and are disproportionately white.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom gave the anti-vaccine movement a brief window of hope in the penultimate week of legislative session when he demanded late amendments to the main medical exemption crackdown bill, Senate Bill 276. But the governor ultimately signed two measures to implement the law, which added fuel to the anger of the anti-vaccine movement. Protests continued for four days after Newsom signed the bills, with rhetoric growing ever more extreme.\n\nActivists had earlier rolled out a sign during bill hearings that said \u201cWelcome to Calabama, y\u2019all\u201d \u2014 a reference comparing Newsom, a liberal Democrat, to former Alabama Governor George Wallace, a Republican infamous for his defiance against desegregation. After the bills were approved, some held signs stating, \"Welcome to Nazifornia,\" complete with the Nazi symbol.\n\nThe new restrictions target schools with an immunization rate below 95 percent, the level health experts consider to offer \"herd immunity.\" Anything below that percentage poses a public health risk, making children more vulnerable in the instance of a measles outbreak or exposure to other diseases.\n\nWhile leaders of the protest movement insist that their ranks are ethnically diverse, data suggest that the schools likeliest to face state scrutiny have a greater share of white students than the California public school average. The 50 public schools with the lowest kindergarten vaccination rates in the state \u2014 all less than 50 percent \u2014 are disproportionately white, according to an analysis by POLITICO. While less than 25 percent of California public school students are white, an average of 55 percent of students are white across the state's 50 least vaccinated campuses.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nAt Valiant Academy of Southern California, less than 5 percent of its 300-plus students have all their required vaccinations, designating it as one of the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d schools according to the Department of Public Health. At the El Cajon school, nearly 70 percent of students are white, according to the California Department of Education.\n\nCommunity Outreach Academy, a charter school near Sacramento, has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the state, with less than half of its students fully vaccinated. There, 98 percent of students are white.\n\nChristina Hildebrand, president and founder of A Voice for Choice, condemned the protester who is facing assault charges for throwing the menstrual cup on the Senate floor. But she defended those who compare the issue to the civil rights movement. She pointed to the gay rights movement and women's suffrage, asserting that this is about bodily autonomy and parental rights.\n\n\"The Legislature is equating it to the black civil rights movement but to me, civil rights movements have happened throughout our history in the U.S.,\" she said. \"To me, do I think it is comparable to MLK and the civil rights movement? I think we're probably in the beginning stages of getting to something like that.\"\n\nHildebrand pushed back against those who see a lack of diversity in the movement, saying that has changed significantly since protests began over a similar law in 2015.\n\nPOLITICO Pro Cannabis High-quality coverage of one of the fastest growing industries in the country.

It was people that could afford to come to Sacramento. The middle to lower class can't afford to take a day off,\" she said. \"But now I'm surprised they feel it's white privilege. If you look at the pictures of who came and protested, there was every race and every color there.\"\n\nOther political juxtapositions have sparked outrage. After some women were arrested, Assemblyman Devon Mathis (R-Visalia) joined protesters in comparing the issue to the separation of immigrant parents and children at the border.\n\nSome protesters donned red capes and white bonnets, borrowing a tactic from abortion advocates who compare themselves to characters in \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\" \u2014 a dystopian future where women have no rights.\n\nLawmakers wondered if reactions to the protests would have been different if the participants weren\u2019t mostly white women. What would have happened if, instead, it was dozens of black men standing on chairs, refusing to leave hearing rooms and beating on the doors of the Senate chambers? Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) said on Twitter she\u2019s \u201cnever seen so much privilege.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want to point out, if constituents from my district waged months-long social harassment campaigns against a member, threatened them with death, harassed and threatened their family\u2026 then came to the Capitol and disrupted session for hours\u2026 they would definitely be arrested,\u201d she said in another tweet.\n\nIn addition to being threatened online and physically pushed by an anti-vaccine protester, Sen. Richard Pan (D-Sacramento), a Taiwanese American doctor who wrote the legislation, faced racist slurs.\n\nOne Twitter post included Pan\u2019s head shot in a lineup of three other Asian doctors who are pro-vaccine with the phrase \u201cAuthoritarians Unite!\u201d \u201cNotice anything else about them?\u201d the image said.\n\nActor Rob Schneider, one of several celebrity vaccination opponents, compared Pan to former Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong. \"My congratulations to the People\u2019s Republic of Chinafornia Chairman Mao Jr.,\u201d Schneider said in a tweet to Pan.\n\nThe California Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus condemned the attacks. \u201cFor too long, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have been seen as perpetual foreigners and generations of contributions from our communities have been ignored. We call on SB 276 opponents to publicly condemn the racism expressed by members of the anti-vaccination movement,\u201d said Assemblyman David Chiu (D-San Francisco), caucus chairman, in a statement.\n\nPan said he and his colleagues have faced escalating harassment this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that\u2019s the kind of tactics the opponents have decided to resort to, perhaps because they don\u2019t have science and facts on their side, so they resort to personal threats and harassment,\u201d Pan told reporters. \"I think it\u2019s disappointing that that's what they have to engage in.\"\n\nAngela Hart contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "The approach reflected the level of desperation among families staunchly opposed to vaccinating their children.", "authors": ["Mackenzie Mays"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b1/62/7ad296e241e5920d9cc1e60bfc85/190917-anti-vaccine-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
