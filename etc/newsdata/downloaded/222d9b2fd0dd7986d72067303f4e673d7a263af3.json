Although Erasmus has overseen notable improvements since being handed the reins, he has maintained that the team is a long way off the finished product.\n\nKey player\n\nSouth Africa have a host of world-class players among their ranks, including Siya Kolisi, South Africa\u2019s first ever black captain, and Wasps\u2019 Willie le Roux. But it\u2019s Faf de Klerk who could prove to be the difference in Japan. Described as a \u201clittle buzzsaw\u201d by Eddie Jones, the nine has hit new heights since moving to Sale in 2017, with his energy, decision-making and wide-ranging set of skills set to terrorise opposition defences.\n\nPast record\n\nThe Springboks are two-time winners, having lifted the trophy on home soil in 1995 and in France in 2007.\n\nPrediction\n\nSouth Africa should easily qualify for the knockout stages but given the strength of their rivals, I can see their World Cup campaign coming to an end in the semi-finals.\n\nFixtures\n\nSaturday 21 September \u2013 New Zealand v South Africa (Yokohama), 10.45am (BST)\n\nSaturday 28 September \u2013 South Africa v Namibia (Toyota), 10.45am\n\nFriday 4 October \u2013 South Africa v Italy (Shizuoka), 10.45am\n\nTuesday 8 October \u2013 South Africa v Canada (Kobe), 11.15am\n\nOdds\n\nSouth Africa to win the World Cup: 9/2", "description": "Fresh off the back of winning their maiden Rugby Championship title, South Africa\u00a0head to Japan among the favourites to lift the World Cup on 2 November.
