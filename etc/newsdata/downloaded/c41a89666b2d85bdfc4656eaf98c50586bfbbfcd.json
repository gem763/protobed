I'm Ellen Mitchell, and here's your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. CLICK HERE to subscribe to the newsletter.\n\nTHE TOPLINE: The House on Wednesday approved a resolution formally rebuking President Trump over his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria.\n\nThe measure passed in a 354-60 vote, with four lawmakers voting present. All 60 votes against the resolution came from Republicans, with the present votes coming from three GOP lawmakers and Rep. Justin Amash Justin AmashAmash says he's happy not feeling 'bound to a particular party' Amash on Syria: Trump's not ending anything Trump says House Democrats 'unfortunately' have the votes to impeach MORE (I-Mich.). The top three House Republicans supported the motion in a rare split from the president.\n\nWhat the resolution does: The resolution -- which was sponsored by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel Eliot Lance EngelTrump-GOP tensions over Syria show signs of easing Trump invites congressional leaders to meeting on Turkey House to vote on resolution condemning Trump's Syria pullback MORE (D-N.Y.) and the panel's top Republican, Rep. Michael McCaul Michael Thomas McCaulTrump-GOP tensions over Syria show signs of easing Trump invites congressional leaders to meeting on Turkey Pelosi: No House vote on impeachment inquiry MORE (Texas), \"opposes the decision to end certain United States efforts to prevent Turkish military operations against Syrian Kurdish forces in Northeast Syria.\"\n\nThe measure also calls on Turkey to end its military action, calls on the United States to protect the Kurds and calls on the White House \"to present a clear and specific plan for the enduring defeat of ISIS.\"\n\n\"The measure we're considering today will send an unambiguous bipartisan, hopefully bicameral rejection of Trump's policy in Syria,\" Engel said ahead of the vote.\n\nThe background: Trump has ordered all U.S. troops in northern Syria to pull back, paving the way for Turkey to launch an offensive against Kurdish forces that were instrumental in the U.S.-led fight against the ISIS.\n\nThe decision was swiftly condemned by lawmakers in both parties as abandoning the Kurds, signaling to future partners the United States is untrustworthy and enabling ISIS to resurge in the chaos.\n\nThe House's resolution came to the floor under suspension of the rules, meaning it needed two-thirds approval to pass. The measure garnered support from all Democrats and 129 Republicans.\n\nWhile the resolution breaks with Trump's decision, Trump is named just once in the measure when it notes he spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Oct. 6.\n\nMore action coming: The vote on the House resolution comes as lawmakers are crafting sanctions legislation against Turkey. Engel and McCaul have said they plan to introduce a bill to sanction Turkey, and Rep. Liz Cheney Elizabeth (Liz) Lynn CheneyThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Hunter Biden speaks out amid Ukraine controversy Fury over Trump Syria decision grows George Conway hits Republicans for not saying Trump's name while criticizing policy MORE (R-Wyo.) on Wednesday unveiled the text of her Turkey sanctions bill with more than 90 Republican co-sponsors.\n\nIn the Senate, Sens. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamTrump-GOP tensions over Syria show signs of easing Trump invites congressional leaders to meeting on Turkey Graham opens door to calling Hunter Biden to testify MORE (R-S.C.) and Chris Van Hollen Christopher (Chris) Van HollenTrump-GOP tensions over Syria show signs of easing Trump invites congressional leaders to meeting on Turkey House to vote on resolution condemning Trump's Syria pullback MORE (D-Md.) are expected to introduce sanctions legislation on Thursday.\n\nThe push for sanctions comes even after Trump levied sanctions on top Turkish officials, including the defense minister, interior minister and energy minister. Lawmakers have said Trump's sanctions did not go far enough to convince Turkey to change course.\n\nTrump's reasoning: Trump said Wednesday that Turkey's offensive against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in northern Syria has \"has nothing to do with us,\" defending his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the region amid criticism.\n\n\"It's not our land,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\n\"If Turkey goes into Syria that's between Turkey and Syria,\" he added. \"That's not between Turkey and the United States, like a lot of stupid people would like you to believe.\"\n\nTrump reiterated his plan to withdraw the United States from \"endless wars.\"\n\n\"Our soldiers are not in harm's way, as they shouldn't be, as two countries fight over land,\" Trump told reporters. \"That has nothing to do with us.\"\n\nTrump also downplayed the U.S. alliance with the Kurds, calling them \"no angels\" and saying the U.S. \"paid a lot of money\" for the Syrian Kurdish forces to fight alongside U.S. troops against ISIS.\n\nMore criticism from Graham: Graham said Wednesday that Trump appears \"hell-bent\" on repeating former President Obama's mistakes in Iraq after Trump said Graham should focus on investigating the 2016 election rather than the Middle East.\n\n\"President Trump Donald John TrumpWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Five takeaways from the Democratic debate in Ohio Democrats debate in Ohio: Who came out on top? MORE is being told EXACTLY what President Obama was told before he withdrew from Iraq. He appears to be hell-bent on making the same mistakes in Syria as President Obama made in Iraq,\" Graham tweeted.\n\n\"The worst thing any Commander in Chief can do is to give land back to the enemy that was taken through blood and sacrifice. I fear those are the consequences of the actions being taken right now,\" he added.\n\nTRUMP URGED TURKISH PRESIDENT TO MAKE A DEAL ON SYRIA IN LETTER: Trump sent a letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan urging him to make a deal with the U.S. on Syria, according to a letter obtained by Fox Business.\n\nIn the letter, sent ahead of the U.S. delegation meeting with Erdo\u011fan on Thursday, Trump warned the Turkish president that \"you don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy--and I will.\"\n\nVice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoOvernight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Trump isolated amid Syria furor | Pompeo, Pence to visit Turkey in push for ceasefire | Turkish troops advance in Syria | Graham throws support behind Trump's sanctions Graham: Erdo\u011fan pledged to Trump to stay away from Kurdish territory in Syria Trump honors Stanley Cup champions, talks impeachment, Turkey MORE are on their way to Turkey to convince Erdo\u011fan to call a cease-fire in his country's offensive against the Kurds in Syria. Trump announced the removal of U.S. troops from Syria last week, prompting Turkey's action.\n\n\"History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!\" Trump's letter reads.\n\nA meeting gone awry: The letter was released following a meeting between Trump and Democratic and Republican leaders at the White House to discuss Turkey's incursion into northern Syria.\n\nDuring the meeting, Trump called his former Defense secretary, Jim Mattis, \"the world's most overrated general,\" after Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerTrump defends 'crime buster' Giuliani amid reported probe Louisiana voters head to the polls in governor's race as Trump urges GOP support Trump urges Louisiana voters to back GOP in governor's race then 'enjoy the game' MORE (D-N.Y.) read a quote from Mattis's appearance Sunday on \"Meet the Press,\" where he warned that \"ISIS will resurge\" if the U.S. does not keep the pressure on in that region.\n\nTrump cut Schumer off, according to two Democratic aides, and said that Mattis was \"the world's most overrated general.\"\n\n\"You know why? He wasn't tough enough,\" Trump said, according to the aides. \"I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in 1 month.\"\n\nA 'meltdown': The meeting ended in conflict after Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiTrump-GOP tensions over Syria show signs of easing Democratic debate starts with immediate question on Trump impeachment White House, Pentagon, Giuliani reject House subpoenas MORE (D-Calif.) said Trump had a \"meltdown.\" Democrats claimed that the president disparaged Pelosi as a \"third-rate politician,\" and the party's leaders walked out soon after.\n\nThe meeting was intended to focus on the response to Turkey as it carries out an offensive in northern Syria that has led to the bloodshed and uncertainty in the region. Trump has dug in on his decision earlier this month to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria, even as lawmakers in both parties have warned him against the consequences of the move.\n\nRead about what the members of the Democratic primary field think about Trump's Syria decision here and here.\n\nAnd here are Five unintended consequences of Trump's Syria withdrawal\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT - BOEING\n\nNext-gen technology for missions of the future:\n\nSupporting the H-47 Chinook Block II enhancements will lift the nation above any challenge for decades to come.
