Now it\u2019s very clear that Britain\u2019s going to be a third country and we will quickly begin negotiating a free trade agreement with that third country, Great Britain,\u201d she said.\n\nThe shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, dubbed the deal a \u201csellout\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the DUP \u2013 he\u2019s sold out virtually every sector of our economy and all those who may have voted to leave believing a deal could be secured that protected their jobs.\u201d\n\nHowever, some of the so-called \u201cSpartans\u201d on the right wing of the Conservative party appeared ready to abandon the DUP and support Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nAndrew Bridgen told Channel 4: \u201cThis is far more palatable to me. It looks like Brexit, it smells like Brexit, that\u2019s Brexit for me, and I\u2019m willing to suck up quite a lot in the withdrawal agreement that I don\u2019t like in order to get to Brexit.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, MPs backing a second referendum appeared to be backing away from tabling an amendment aimed at attaching a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d to the deal, as Jeremy Corbyn declined to say whether Labour would back it. They are expected to decide on Friday how to proceed.\n\nEU sources said Johnson had not directly asked leaders to rule out an extension during his address to them on Thursday afternoon, but that he had \u201cmade very clear his intention was to be out by 31 October\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister had been helped in his attempts to create a cliff-edge by comments from Jean-Claude Juncker casting doubt on the possibility of a further Brexit delay, but the heads of state and government did not follow the European commission president\u2019s lead.\n\nJuncker had told reporters earlier in the day that he was \u201cruling out\u201d a \u201cprolongation\u201d, although the decision is outside his remit as commission president. \u201cIf we have a deal, we have a deal, and there is no need for prolongation,\u201d he said. But one EU official conceded that the comments were \u201cfake news\u201d and that the view was not widely shared among the leaders.\n\nA summit communique issued after two hours of discussion simply tasked the commission and European parliament with taking \u201cthe necessary steps to ensure that the agreement can enter into force on 1 November\u201d.\n\nDonald Tusk, the president of the European council, who will provide guidance on the options in the event of another rejection of a deal, said the issue of an extension was for a later date.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur intention is to work towards ratification. We support a deal and this was a clear decision of the 27 member states. And we prepared for this ratification, politically, logistically, technically.\n\n\u201cNow the ball is in the court of the UK. I have no idea what will be the result of the debate in the House of Commons on Saturday. It isn\u2019t for me to comment on political developments in the UK. But if there is a request for an extension, I will consult member states to see how they react.\u201d\n\nA senior EU official said that the leaders would follow events on Saturday, and reflect on the next steps if they were in a \u201cdifferent situation\u201d.\n\nA second diplomatic source said they had chosen not to interfere in a \u201csensitive domestic debate \u2026 but they leave the door open to the possibility of an extension, to be discussed at a later stage \u2013 if required\u201d.\n\nIn a joint press conference, Tusk, Juncker, the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, spoke of their \u201csadness\u201d over Brexit.\n\n\u201cWhat I feel today is sadness,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cBecause in my heart, I will always be a remainer. And I hope that if our British friends decide to return one day, our door will always be open.\u201d\n\nVaradkar said: \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like an old friend that\u2019s going on a journey or an adventure without us, and we really hope it works out for them. But I think there will always be a place at the table for the United Kingdom if they ever chose to come back.\u201d\n\nMerkel said EU leaders had not focused on the question of extending Brexit talks, if the House of Commons voted down the deal on Saturday: \u201cWe have not taken any position \u2026 should A, B or C happen.\u201d She added that it was \u201cnot a happy day for us\u201d.\n\nThe PM is widely expected to make another bid to secure an early general election, whether or not his deal is endorsed on Saturday.\n\nIf MPs reject it, he is legally obliged under the Benn act to request a delay to Brexit \u2013 though senior government officials insisted again on Thursday that Johnson was determined to leave the EU on 31 October.\n\nIf he tries to frustrate the act \u2013 for example by sending a second, contradictory letter, that would set up a constitutional crisis that would have to be resolved in the courts.\n\nBut with an extension secured, he would then be likely to press for an election \u2013 and he devoted part of his short speech in Brussels to setting out manifesto-friendly pledges.", "description": "PM insists he is \u2018very confident\u2019 his deal will be approved by parliament on Saturday", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Daniel Boffey", "Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b8ffbcf76aa66fb5707d78cb0442c21092f280d/0_7_4229_2538/master/4229.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c242a26b44546ef390336f0723629bf5", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
