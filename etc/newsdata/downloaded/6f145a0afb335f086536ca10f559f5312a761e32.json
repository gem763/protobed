As of Thursday, a majority of the 435-seat House of Representatives, 218 Democrats and one independent, said they supported the probe.\n\nIn private remarks to staff at the US mission to the United Nations, Trump attacked the intelligence officer as \"almost a spy\" and likened the whistleblower complaint to treason.\n\nDemocrats suggested such attacks broke the law.\n\n\"The president's comments today constitute reprehensible witness intimidation and an attempt to obstruct Congress' impeachment inquiry,\" the chairmen of three House committees investigating the whistleblower complaint said in a joint statement.\n\nThe whistleblower presented the nine-page complaint on August 12 to the inspector general of the intelligence community.\n\nThat official, a Trump appointee, found it credible and of \"urgent concern\" and forwarded it to Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence.\n\nMaguire initially refused to deliver the complaint to Congress, but it was ultimately declassified, and Congress released it Thursday.\n\nTrump acknowledges he urged Ukraine to launch an anti-corruption probe against Biden -- a frontrunner in the race to take on the president in the 2020 election -- and Biden's son.\n\nOn the call, Trump said he was enlisting US Attorney General Bill Barr and personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani -- a private citizen -- to coordinate with Ukrainian officials on the investigation.\n\nTrump has said he exerted \"no pressure\" on Kiev, a claim echoed by Zelensky.\n\nBut critics maintain that the president held up $400 million in military aid to Ukraine, to be released only if it investigated the Bidens.\n\nAt a fundraiser in California on Thursday, Biden said Trump would \"like to get foreign help to win elections.\"\n\nBiden added there's not been \"one shred of evidence\" showing wrongdoing by his family.\n\n- 'Nothing improper' -\n\nThe non-verbatim record of the call did not show Trump explicitly tying aid to Zelensky's probing Biden, and the White House said the complaint showed Trump did \"nothing improper.\"\n\nSoliciting foreign help in a US election is illegal, whether or not inducements are offered.\n\nMaguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee that he earlier withheld the complaint because Trump's call was subject to executive privilege.\n\nBut Maguire also said he thought the whistleblower \"did the right thing.\"\n\nWhile several Republicans including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy defended Trump and condemned the whistleblower complaint, some said they were deeply troubled.\n\n\"There is a lot in the whistleblower complaint that is concerning,\" House Republican Will Hurd tweeted Thursday. \"We need to fully investigate all of the allegations.\"\n\nMaguire insisted he does not know the whistleblower's identity.\n\nOn Thursday The New York Times reported that he is a male CIA officer who was detailed to the White House.\n\nThat prompted his lawyer to warn that any decision to report identifying information would be \"reckless, as it can place the individual in harm's way.\"\n\nThe Times defended its decision to publish limited details about the whistleblower's identity, citing the need to establish his credibility.", "description": "The White House scrambled to \"lock down\" records of President Donald Trump's phone call pressing for Ukraine's interference in next year's US election, according to an incendiary whistleblower complaint released Thursday, in the latest episode of an intensifying impeachment drama", "authors": ["Michael Mathes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ba6.MLrOXOdA30GVQX_cOw--~B/aD01MTI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/dc51338bc78d29e7342171b75f120f2fbbb7d10c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
