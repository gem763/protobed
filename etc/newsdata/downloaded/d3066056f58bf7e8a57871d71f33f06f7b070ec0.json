None of the three had won on the PGA Tour.\n\nHubbard had the lead until he missed his only fairway of the final round on the par five 15th, into the high grass of a hazard. He was able to chop out across the fairway into more thick grass, hit his third into a fairway bunker and missed an eight-foot par putt.\n\nHarrington, who took 16 years to reach the PGA Tour and gave up a year to be with his wife, who had cancer, birdied the 15th with a two-putt from 10 feet, hit his tee shot to three feet for birdie on the 16th and was tied for the lead until a three-putt from 45 feet up the ridge on the 17th hole. Harrington missed a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th and shot 67.\n\nHubbard had one last chance with a bold tee shot on the 18th, one of the toughest driving holes on the PGA Tour with water down the left side and a large bunker to the right. That set him up with a short iron to 25 feet, but his putt to at least force a playoff stayed left. Hubbard closed with a 69.", "description": "Lanto Griffin took the lead with a 35-foot birdie putt on the 16th hole before winning the Houston Open on Sunday with a one-shot victory that sends him to the Masters.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "James Corrigan"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
