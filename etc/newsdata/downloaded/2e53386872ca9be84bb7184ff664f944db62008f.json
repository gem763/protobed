They yelled \u201cGangster cops, death to your whole family.\u201d\n\nPolice have faced criticism for using heavy-headed tactics including tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and a water cannon to subdue protesters. On occasion they have fired live rounds, wounding a teenage activist in the chest last month. But police say they\u2019re the ones who are victims of violence, having been on the receiving end of hurled bricks and firebombs.\n\nThis month, an 18-year-old was charged with intentional wounding for a slashing attack on a riot officer.\n\nAt Sunday\u2019s rally, some protesters threw umbrellas and other objects at riot police, who responded with tear gas, bringing traffic on a main road to a standstill.\n\nProtesters ripped up bricks from the sidewalk and scattered them on the streets to block cars.\n\nSome protesters reportedly took refuge across the street in the luxury Peninsula Hotel, which promptly lowered its shutters.\n\nMany protesters moved to the nearby Chungking Mansions, a focal point for South Asian residents and businesses, where they continued to face off with police, bringing the normally bustling Nathan Road tourist strip to a standstill.\n\nThey were showing support for the former British colony\u2019s ethnic and religious minorities \u2014 another aim of the rally \u2014 after police used a water cannon to spray a mosque and bystanders with a stinging blue-dyed liquid the previous weekend.\n\nPolice briefly used the cannon on a nearby street, but it appeared to be filled with ordinary water this time. The police dispersal operation lasted late into the night, as police engulfed streets in tear gas and called the protesters \u201crioters\u201d for taking part in an \u201cunauthorized assembly.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s protest movement shows no signs of cooling even after the government formally withdrew the unpopular China extradition bill on Wednesday, giving in to one of the movement\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cBecause the problem is much more than before,\u201d said a protester who only gave his name as Nephets, citing heavy-handed police tactics. \u201cWe can see the future is controlled by China. We can see all the rules and even the law is starting to be controlled by the China government. For the Hong Kong people, there\u2019s no say over our land and that is the problem.\u201d\n\nNephets, who said he was 40 and worked in media, said he attended protests in support of younger hardcore protesters who have led violent confrontations with police.\n\nDespite repeated government appeals for people not to side with mobs involved in vandalism, throwing gasoline bombs and other violence, the protest movement is still rousing determined support from more moderate demonstrators. They\u2019re broadly worried about the future and freedoms of the city that reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, with promises from Beijing that it would largely be its own boss, its way of life unchanged.", "description": "An unauthorized anti-government rally in Hong Kong quickly turned chaotic on Sunday as police used tear gas to disperse protesters on a major tourist strip,...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU074_hkprot_ZG_20191027164002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
