Keep an eye on this small-school QB", "language": "en", "text": "When I wrote my \u201c5 NFL draft prospects to watch\u201d story for this week, I neglected to spotlight an FCS passer who has been rippling just beneath the surface in NFL draft circles recently.\n\nHis name is Case Cookus, which you might already be vaguely familiar with. He was involved in a viral play a few years ago that reached national audiences. (More on that tidbit in a bit.)\n\nBut first, let\u2019s tell you a little about the Northern Arizona quarterback prospect who has overcome quite a bit to get to where he is now as a pro prospect. This season is the second time the 6-4, 210-pound passer has overcome a season-ending injury.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFirst, Cookus suffered a shoulder injury that shut down his 2016 campaign a year after setting an FCS freshman record with 37 TD passes in 2015. Then last season, Cookus suffered a broken collarbone on his right side \u2014 the arm he throws with \u2014 and was shut down after only five quarters of play in 2018.\n\nNow Cookus, who turns 23 years old in a few weeks, is one of only five passers in FCS this season to surpass the 1,000-yard mark through three games. And he\u2019s got a big test Saturday against another FCS program with a legitimate NFL prospect.\n\nFor a player who has played at a lower level of competition, overcome a few major injuries and one who almost gave up football to become a fireman, that\u2019s pretty impressive.\n\nNorthern Arizona QB Case Cookus has shown enough skill and resilience to be on NFL scouts' radars. (Getty Images)\n\nThe best since Jimmy Garoppolo? One opposing coach thinks so\n\nThis season, Cookus has completed 58-of-98 passes for 1,020 yards with eight TDs and two INTs. Both picks came in the Lumberjacks\u2019 63-41 loss at Arizona two weeks ago, but Cookus kept firing away and throwing for 373 yards.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the picks came when Cookus was pressured and hit. The other came in a jump-ball situation. But in that Arizona game there were enough high-level throws \u2014 even if they came against some reserves \u2014 to open eyes. He\u2019s got legitimate arm talent, nice athletic traits and some moxie.\n\nThere are warts to his game, too, such as taking too many sacks, missing open targets at times and believing he can make almost any throw. But Cookus is going to be looked at by NFL scouts as a fascinating project for the next draft cycle. Don\u2019t be shocked if he\u2019s picked late.\n\nFCS No. 15 NAU heads into a nice test this weekend against No. 10 Illinois State that will be attended by NFL scouts. And Illinois State head coach Brock Spack gave a preview of what his team will be up against vs. Cookus.\n\n\"[Cookus] throws people open,\u201d Spack said. \u201cHe's very accurate. He's really good. We've seen an NFL quarterback; [Cookus] is one. \u201cHe's the best guy I've seen since [Jimmy] Garoppolo at this level.\"\n\nThe Redbirds also have a highly respected NFL draft prospect in the game \u2014 RB James Robinson. The hard-running Robinson figures to be the highest-drafted FCS prospect this coming spring, carrying a solid Day 3 grade entering the season and doing good work in the two games this season since he was held in check by Northern Illinois in the opener.\n\nThis game is a rare FCS regular-season contest with a pair of legitimate NFL prospects, one on each sideline. And don\u2019t rule out the idea of Cookus continuing to elevate his stock. He was named to the Senior Bowl preseason watch list, and he\u2019s also going to be a target of other pre-draft All-Star games such as the East-West Shrine game and the NFLPA game.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of his health and durability that must pass scouts\u2019 muster, and he\u2019s no guarantee to receive one of the coveted QB invites to the NFL scouting combine. But as he keeps racking up the numbers in his NAU career despite the setbacks, Cookus will be harder to ignore.\n\nWill he be a second-round pick, a la Garoppolo? Not likely. But a seventh-round selection? It wouldn\u2019t be stunning.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that Cookus will surpass the 9,000-yard career passing mark (he\u2019s 18 yards short) in the game and could end up surpassing former NFL QB Travis Brown\u2019s school record for pass yards in a career (11,400). Cookus also is only 12 TD passes shy of breaking the school\u2019s record, held by Jason Murrietta.\n\nAnd despite Cookus\u2019 two-pick game at Arizona (plus another two-INT game against the Wildcats two years ago), he has thrown only 16 interceptions in 1,047 attempts in his career.\n\nAfter his brilliant freshman season in 2015, Cookus was named the Jerry Rice Award winner, given each year to the most outstanding FCS freshman in the country. The winner the year before? Eastern Washington\u2019s Cooper Kupp, who is now a standout receiver for the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nA QB called for targeting? Whoa\n\nCookus\u2019 name first entered the national discussion late in the 2017 college football season. The red-hot Lumberjacks had won six straight heading into a game at Montana.\n\nAbout halfway through the first quarter, this happened:\n\nHere is a look at the play that caused NAU QB Case Cookus to be ejected from the game for targeting.\n\n\n\nCourtesy @ROOTSPORTS_NW pic.twitter.com/vVmHgn1A3B \u2014 Montana Griz Football (@MontanaGrizFB) November 4, 2017\n\nA quarterback! The targeting rule already was a hot topic that season before this call, and Twitter was ablaze with shock over Cookus being called for it. Some observers had never seen a QB flagged and ejected for such a call; some haven\u2019t seen it since.\n\nBut since then, Cookus has made a name for himself for less ignominious reasons \u2014 as a draft prospect we need to keep close track of over the coming months.\n\nHere are a few clips of Cookus in action:\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Case Cookus has suffered two season-ending injuries in his prolific career.
