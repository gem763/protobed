He was convicted of drug conspiracy, weapons charges and lying to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nThe two-week trial put a spotlight on the lucrative drug trade between the United States and Honduras, where poverty, violence and corruption have driven thousands of migrants to flee north through Mexico.\n\nUS prosecutors say the drug conspiracy was protected by the Central American country\u2019s government. The trial featured testimony that the convicted Mexican drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n gave $1m in bribes to Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez to pass along to his brother.\n\nThe defense lawyer Michael Tein had argued that prosecutors had insufficient evidence and that five turncoat witnesses who admitted to dozens of killings were \u201cliars, losers and murderers\u201d.\n\nThe Honduran president was not charged in the case but was labeled a co-conspirator. The president tweeted during the trial that the prosecution\u2019s allegations were \u201c100% false, absurd and ridiculous\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez speaks during a rally in his brother\u2019s support in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, on 9 October.

And with that level of power and control, the defendant was virtually untouchable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe results of that are astonishing.\n\n\u201cBeginning in 2010, the defendant worked on massive cocaine shipments sent to the United States on a monthly basis. The president of Honduras deployed the military to the border with Guatemala to protect the defendant\u2019s drug turf. The defendant used the national police to murder one of his drug rivals. And the ringleader in that murder was later promoted to become the chief of the entire police force,\u201d Bove said.\n\nTrump's plan for those seeking safe haven: a ticket to the violent heart of Central America Read more\n\nMeanwhile, the prosecutor said, Guzm\u00e1n was able to travel to Honduras in 2013 twice despite being one of the most wanted people in the world.\n\n\u201cAnd during the second meeting, he handed the defendant a million dollars in cash, drug money, to help the defendant\u2019s brother, Juan Orlando, get elected president so he could keep protecting them,\u201d the prosecutor said.\n\nJuan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez has been seen as a key regional ally by Washington, which was quick to recognize his re-election in December despite widespread allegations of fraud. Last month, Honduras agreed to allow the US to return asylum seekers from third countries to the violence-stricken Central American nation.", "description": "Prosecutors said the president, Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, enabled his brother\u2019s trafficking", "authors": ["Staff", "Agencies In New York"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f07688003a8faf7ee41ff0a812a28c1fc91cb4ca/0_0_2484_1491/master/2484.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=13ef88fa1dc1abef926b80b1a660b09e", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
