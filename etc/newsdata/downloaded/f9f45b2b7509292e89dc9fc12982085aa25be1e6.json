Ultimately, the data is going to decide what something is or what something isn't.\"\n\nIt's not clear precisely who's working for DeLonge's group, or whether their research will be peer-reviewed, so we'd take this claim with a pinch of salt for now.\n\nAll we know is that it's an eclectic mix of scholars and pop stars.\n\nAccording to its website, the academy is a \u201ccollaboration between academia, industry and pop culture to advance society\u2019s understanding of scientific phenomena and its technological implications.\"\n\nMost famously, the group got the US Navy to admit to several UFO sightings near US military institutions going back several years.\n\nThey led to the astonishing reports which in May revealed Navy pilots had near-daily interactions with mysterious flying objects in 2014 and 2015.\n\nAcross several interviews, pilots described objects moving at hypersonic speeds and performing acts \"beyond the physical limits of a human crew\".\n\nLieutenant Ryan Graves said he saw \u201cstrange objects\u201d with \u201cno visible engine or infrared exhaust plumes\u201d reaching at least 30,000 feet and flying at hypersonic speeds almost daily while training off the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nGraves, an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot who has been with the Navy for 10 years, told The New York Times: \u201cThese things would be out there all day.\n\n\u201cKeeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy.\n\n\u201cWith the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we\u2019d expect.\u201d\n\nThis story originally appeared in The Sun.", "description": "A band of alien hunters led by an ex-punk rocker claim they've found evidence of UFOs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/05/29/694940094001_6042129620001_6042123044001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
