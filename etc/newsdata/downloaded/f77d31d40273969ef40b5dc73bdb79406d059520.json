The clip starts off with the Galaxy Fold flipping open and closing again before transitioning to a new model that shuts in half like a clamshell.\n\nIt's a brief teaser for what's to come as Samsung and some other phone makers race to find new ways of innovating in smartphone design. Huawei recently released its folding phone, the Mate X, in China, while fellow Chinese firm Xiaomi has previously teased a gadget that folds backwards from a tablet into a phone that can be held with one hand.\n\nIt isn't yet clear whether Samsung plans on releasing the device commercially. According to Reuters, the firm said in a statement that it couldn't comment on future products but is \"committed to pioneering the foldable category, including investing in the development of new form factors.\"\n\nA Samsung spokesperson wasn't immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.", "description": "Samsung showed off the foldable flip phone concept in a video at its developer conference on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Ryan Browne"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106212078-1572424512156samsungfoldablephoneconceptflipphone.jpg?v=1572424580", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
