Carter, who had fallen in Plains, Ga., the day before, wore a white bandage on his head and had a bruise over his left eye.\n\nCarter, the longest living U.S. president, required stitches above his brow after the fall.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, despite the injuries he was still found at a Habitat for Humanity event helping rally volunteers ahead of the upcoming building project later on Sunday.\n\nHe told the audience at the event that even though he had to go to the hospital earlier, he \u201chad a No. 1 priority and that was to come to Nashville and build houses.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s build in Nashville is set to run from Oct. 6-11.
