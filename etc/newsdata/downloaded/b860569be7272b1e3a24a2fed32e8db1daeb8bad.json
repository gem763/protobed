Lindsey Graham put it.\n\nIt's correct that the whistleblower was not present for the phone call in which Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, but the summary of the call released by the White House largely corroborates the account detailed in the complaint.\n\nIn addition, both the Trump-appointed intelligence community inspector general and acting director of intelligence deemed the complaint to be credible. The acting DNI, Joseph Maguire, said in a hearing last week that the whistleblower \"followed the law every step of the way\" and \"did the right thing.\"\n\nAs for House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, whom Trump is accusing of \"treason,\" he has received criticism for paraphrasing Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president during the same hearing.\n\nSchiff has been tapped by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to lead House Democrats' impeachment investigation, which will largely center around Trump's alleged efforts to solicit election interference from Ukraine.\n\nGo deeper: Schiff says House Intel has reached agreement for whistleblower testimony", "description": "\"Was this person SPYING on the U.S. President?
