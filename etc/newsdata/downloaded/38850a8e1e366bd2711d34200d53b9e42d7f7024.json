But given the lack of either protest or accountability, why would he stop?\n\nAny other politician would have been crippled by even glancing at this type of intermingling of her public and private interests.\n\nTake for example, the political family most dogged by scandals of this nature\u2014the Clintons.\n\nThe Trump family\u2019s double-dealing is light years ahead (below?) the worst of the Clintons\u2019 grifting. Yet for some reason it\u2019s treated with only a fraction of the seriousness.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tim Miller", "Thebulwark.Com Trumps-Doonbegdoggle"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
