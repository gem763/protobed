Together with Lamont Dozier, the Hollands formed the legendary Holland-Dozier-Holland (HDH), the crack songwriting-production team whose songs for the likes of the Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, the Temptations and Marvin Gaye made them, in Stevie Wonder\u2019s words, \u201cthe foundations of Motown\u201d.\n\nThey went mostly unnoticed compared with the stars, but seven years ago, a church minister convinced the siblings that, now they were in their 70s, it was time to tell their story. \u201cHe told me: \u2018If you don\u2019t write a book, someone else will, and they\u2019re not going to write what you want them to,\u2019\u201d Eddie, 79, says. Thus, the Hollands have penned a revealing autobiography. Named after a song they wrote for the Vandellas, Come and Get These Memories shows how so much era-defining pop music came out of Motown boss Berry Gordy\u2019s small house and studios on 2648 West Grand Boulevard in Detroit.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019d been in New York, we\u2019d have had all these places to go,\u201d Eddie muses. \u201cBut in Detroit there wasn\u2019t anywhere, so we ended up at Motown. It was our club. People could converse, play cards, but Brian and I had our own office because Berry didn\u2019t want anything getting in the way of those hits.\u201d Thirteen of them reached No 1 in the US, and many more remain radio and wedding-disco staples. Brian, 78, admits they never expected such longevity. \u201cAs we\u2019ve got older, it feels like it was a miracle.\u201d Here, they talk through some of those imperishable tunes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Martha and the Vandellas.

As teenagers, they came to the attention of Gordy, who had founded Tamla Records in 1959 and sister label Motown Records (short for \u201cmotor town\u201d) the following year, housing both under the name Motown Record Corporation. A local singer friend recommended Eddie, who then told him about Brian\u2019s blossoming musical talents. After Brian\u2019s taste of success co-writing on the Marvelettes\u2019 1961 No 1 Please Mr Postman, he wanted more.\n\nEddie had started making music as a singer but was more interested in writing lyrics \u2013 and the greater riches in songwriting. Dozier was a Motown artist/arranger/songwriter/producer, but the trio realised that by pooling their talents \u2013 Eddie on lyrics, the others music \u2013 they could be greater than the sum of their parts. \u201cWe were young, aggressive and inspired,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cOur music was different. In school, people would tell Brian: \u2018You can\u2019t do a chord like that.\u2019 He\u2019d go: \u2018But it sounds right.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe continues: \u201cI would always examine a song as it happened and say: \u2018Give me a few more bars on this.\u2019 Brian would ask me why and I\u2019d say: \u2018Because I need the verse part.\u2019 He was relating to it differently to how I was. He\u2019d say: \u2018Your lyrics are getting in the way of my instrumentation. Nobody listens to the lyrics anyway.\u2019 We used to get into long-drawn arguments about that, the importance of words versus music, but then we realised that they meshed together.\u201d\n\nHeat Wave, their first smash, a song about erupting love, giddily sung by Martha Reeves, embodies the era\u2019s spirit of excitement and liberation. \u201cI realised that females bought the most records, and they always seemed to be falling in love with somebody,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cI was drawn to that sensitivity. I felt the combination of the music and the female voice would work.\u201d It did. \u201cGirls would come from Cleveland, Chicago, all over the place,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cThey said: \u2018We want to meet you because you understand us.\u2019\u201d\n\nMartin Luther King\u2019s 1963 speech \u2013 \u201cI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will be judged not by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character\u201d \u2013 resonated at Motown. Gordy had his own vision, of a black-owned, black-artist record company making music for all races the world over. The primary vehicle for achieving this, and inspiring generations of black women, were all-female trio the Supremes, although initially their nickname at the company was \u201cthe no-hit Supremes\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey needed a hit and we felt we could give them one,\u201d says Eddie. \u201cThey weren\u2019t grown women. They were teenage girls, so we wanted a song about an adult situation with a teenage delivery, and Diana Ross had the perfect voice for that.\u201d\n\nThe inspiration for Baby Love, their second Supremes No 1 after Where Did Our Love Go, lay close to home. Brian, married with kids, had fallen for Ross, and the pair \u2013 as Eddie puts it \u2013 \u201ccried on each other\u2019s shoulders\u201d. Brian admits they dated and is teased by his older brother. \u201cCome on, Brian! You were in love with her!\u201d Brian corrects him: \u201cWe were in love with each other.\u201d\n\nAt the piano, Brian poured out his feelings for Ross and started singing \u201cBaby love, oh baby love.\u201d Eddie thought it was a silly title, but took it as the starting point for an exquisite tale of yearning that became a global smash. As for Ross\u2019s unwitting role in the song\u2019s conception, Brian chuckles: \u201cShe had no idea.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Four Tops on the TV show Ready, Steady, Go. Photograph: BIPS/Getty Images\n\nBrian\u2019s marriage to Sharon Pierce started as love at first sight when they were at school. They married when he was 18 and had two children, but she suffered from what we now call bipolar disorder, along with terrible mood swings and migraines. Sharon eventually killed herself, years after the pair had found themselves in a volatile, loveless marriage. \u201cIt was a very, very dark time,\u201d he says. Hurt and rejected, he poured out his pain at the piano: \u201cBaby I need your loving / Got to have all your loving \u2026\u201d Eddie, aware of the situation, wrote the remaining lyrics based upon his brother\u2019s feelings.\n\nThe song wasn\u2019t right for the Supremes or the Vandellas \u2013 \u201cBrian had such feeling for it, but I didn\u2019t know if anyone could sing it,\u201d Eddie says. It went unused for two years until Motown signed another vocal group. \u201cI remember it like yesterday,\u201d he reminisces. \u201cMickey Stevenson [Motown\u2019s A&R] came into the office and said: \u201cMan, you got anything for the Four Tops? I said: \u2018Yeah, we got something!\u2019\u201d Eddie had remembered this colossus of lyrical agony and melodic ecstasy, which Levi Stubbs sang perfectly to create the Tops\u2019 first hit.\n\nBaby Love starts with the distinctive \u201cOoh, ooh\u201d intro and piles into the chorus; the follow-up hits the chorus from the off. Brian explains: \u201cWe always tried to grab people in the first 10 seconds.\u201d\n\nDozier has said that he came up with the title of the Supremes\u2019 third consecutive US No 1 when he was seeing two women. One confronted the other and he yelled: \u201cStop! In the name of love \u2026\u201d For the lyrics, Eddie drew on his own experiences. Like Brian, he had married young. After getting a neighbour, Almetta Fordham, \u201cin trouble\u201d (ie pregnant) he agreed to marry her to \u201cget her stepfather off her back\u201d on condition that \u201cshe would let me lead a free life, doing what I wanted. I was 16 years old and didn\u2019t know who I was and she would agree with that.\u201d\n\nBy the time the couple were divorcing, Eddie had started dating his future second wife, Vernelle Craighead, which inspired this heartbreak classic. Eddie explains that the chorus and lines such as: \u201cBaby, I\u2019m aware of where you go\u201d represent his first wife, but the situation was further complicated by another girl who liked him and told Almetta about Vernelle to try and break them up. \u201cA complex situation, but it sure made a good song.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Supremes. Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nIn 2015, Dozier told the Guardian that he came up with the song\u2019s title after meeting a young soldier heading for Vietnam, who had had a premonition that he wouldn\u2019t be coming home \u2013 and was subsequently shipped back in a body bag. Eddie says he was unaware of this and wrote the lyrics about being unable to escape an unhealthy romantic situation. \u201cWhen people become emotionally involved, they have some kind of conflict with themselves,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo the protagonist can\u2019t run from her emotions.\u201d\n\nHDH generally tailored songs to an artist. This one was perfect for the emotional hurricane of Reeves\u2019s vocals; the trademark Motown pounding beat was augmented with stomping feet and snow chains thumped against the studio floor.\n\nThe Vietnam connection endured. In 1988, Nowhere to Run hit the charts again after being used in the Robin Williams film Good Morning, Vietnam.\n\nAlthough they mostly wrote songs in the office, HDH didn\u2019t keep regular hours and would work anywhere that inspiration struck. This 1965 chart-topper (which replaced the Supremes\u2019 HDH-penned Back in My Arms Again at No 1) derived from an expression Dozier\u2019s grandfather would use when he was a kid.\n\nBy now, the trio were feeling the pressure of matching their stellar standards and were, as Eddie notes, \u201cour own biggest critics\u201d. Thus, the brothers remain grateful to the Funk Brothers, the crack team of musicians recruited by Stevenson to lay down the instrumentation.\n\n\u201cMickey found them in the craziest places,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cBut they were talented jazz guys. At first, they thought our songs were junk. They\u2019d say: \u2018Oh, easy money for us. Those songs are nuthin!\u2019\u201d Brian remembers first seeing seminal bass player James Jamerson lugging his upright bass in school. \u201cI told him: \u2018Why are you lugging that damned thing around? It\u2019s the ugliest instrument I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019 But he was one of the greatest.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Holland Dozier Holland. Photograph: Redferns\n\nDisaster struck: the Supremes\u2019 1965 HDH-penned single Nothing But Heartaches only reached No 10 in the US. Gordy issued an astonishing memo that read: \u201cWe will release nothing less than Top 10 product on any artist and because the Supremes\u2019 worldwide acceptance is greater than the other artists, on them we will only release No 1 records.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gave us something to strive for,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cReach for the stars! It was a psychological trigger.\u201d It was one that worked. One night, Brian called Eddie to say he had come up with some elongated chords that \u201csounded sorta symphonic\u201d. He then explained that Gordy wanted the song, which had no lyrics, for the Supremes \u2013 and that he wanted it finished and recorded in the morning.\n\n\u201cI said: \u2018What?\u2019\u201d Eddie remembers. \u201cNormally, it took us weeks to write a song. Twice I gave up on it and was going to call Brian and tell him: \u2018I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m burnt out.\u2019 But I didn\u2019t have the heart.\u201d Instead, Eddie went to bed, gambling that he would write the lyrics in the morning. He finished it at noon. \u201cI was still writing the lyrics while we were rehearsing Diana. I swore that I would never put myself through that again.\u201d But it paid off with the Supremes\u2019 sixth US chart-topper.\n\nOne of the last big HDH hits before the start of legal wrangles with Motown and, much later, Dozier\u2019s exit from the team, this song\u2019s dramatic, hurtling soul is also rooted in the trio\u2019s colourful love lives. All three were seeing a different Bernadette (well, almost \u2013 Brian\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s middle name was Bernadette). So when Brian came up with an interesting melody and a title, Eddie said: \u201cAre you serious? You can\u2019t call it Bernadette!\u201d\n\nEddie based the words on his girlfriend, who was \u201cextremely attractive, with her own sense of style. The kind of girl that all the guys wanted. I was in love with her, but I didn\u2019t want it to overpower me.\u201d Thus, each Bernadette assumed the song was about them, and Eddie never confirmed the subject of his lyrics. \u201cI should call her and tell her,\u201d he jokes, and the septuagenarians hoot like teenagers.\n\n\u201cIt was a great feeling to be part of that whole echelon,\u201d sighs Brian. \u201cWe loved every minute of it.\u201d\n\nCome and Get These Memories is published on 18 October by Omnibus.
