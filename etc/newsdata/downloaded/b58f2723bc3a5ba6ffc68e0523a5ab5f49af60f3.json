Those rates would be halved for single individuals.\n\nThe new tax will partially fund Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan as well as his affordable housing and universal childcare plans.\n\nSanders argues there has been a \u201cmassive transfer of wealth from those who have too little to those who have too much\u201d over the last three decades.\n\n\u201cUnder this plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over 15 years which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class,\u201d the progressive candidate said.\n\nSanders\u2019 plan goes beyond Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax plan, which would impose just a 2 percent tax on families with $50 million and a 3 percent tax on those with $1 billion.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday rolled out his plan to levy an \"extreme wealth tax\" on millionaires and billionaires, which he plans to enforce through the creation of a \"national wealth registry.\"\"Today, the United States has more income and", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1u09XTOIgXEp5ihN8V8Dfg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/slick_thumb/yahooNews-308259-1569351980377.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
