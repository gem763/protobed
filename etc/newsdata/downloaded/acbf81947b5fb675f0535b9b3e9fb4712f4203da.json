(AP) - Deshaun Watson threw for 280 yards and a touchdown while running for two more, outdueling Chiefs counterpart Patrick Mahomes in a matchup of former first-round picks and leading the Houston Texans to a 31-24 victory over Kansas City on Sunday.\n\nCarlos Hyde added 116 yards rushing and a touchdown against the team that traded him to Houston (4-2) before the start of the season. DeAndre Hopkins hauled in nine passes for 55 yards.\n\nNone was bigger than his last, when the Texans star made a sliding grab on fourth-and-3 from the Kansas City 27 with just under 2 minutes to go. That allowed Houston to run out the clock and deal the Chiefs (4-2) their second consecutive loss - both at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nMahomes, who was selected two spots ahead of Watson in the 2017 draft, finished with 273 yards passing and three touchdowns, though he also threw his first interception of the season.\n\nStar wide receiver Tyreek Hill returned to action for the first time since Week 1, when he broke his collarbone, to catch five passes for 80 yards and two of the Chiefs\u2019 scores.\n\nSEAHAWKS 32, BROWNS 28\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) - Chris Carson scored on a 1-yard touchdown run with 3:30 left, Russell Wilson threw two TD passes and ran for one and Seattle rallied past mistake-prone Cleveland, improving to 3-0 on the road for the first time in 39 years.\n\nThe Seahawks (5-1) gave up touchdowns on Cleveland\u2019s first three possessions before storming back.\n\nWilson connected with Jaron Brown for two scores, and Seattle\u2019s cool quarterback scampered 16 yards for a TD. The Seahawks last won their first three road games in 1980, when they went 4-12.\n\nThe Browns (2-4) were hurt by their own miscues. They couldn\u2019t overcome four turnovers, a blocked punt or quarterback Baker Mayfield\u2019s hip injury and fell to 0-3 at FirstEnergy Stadium.\n\nMayfield threw three interceptions, raising his NFL-leading total to 11. Trying to bring the Browns back late, Mayfield, who went to the locker room in the third quarter to be evaluated, was picked off by Seattle\u2019s K.J. Wright with 2:41 remaining.\n\nSAINTS 13, JAGUARS 6\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) - Teddy Bridgewater found Jared Cook for a 4-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter, and New Orleans held on to beat Jacksonville and improve to 4-0 without injured starter Drew Brees.\n\nComing off a 300-yard, four-touchdown performance against Tampa Bay, Bridgewater was less effective against the Jaguars (2-4). But he did enough for New Orleans\u2019 defense.\n\nGardner Minshew was sacked twice, hurried often and threw his first interception as a starter. The rookie sensation completed 14 of 29 passes for 163 yards and was held without a touchdown for the first time this season.\n\nBridgewater was 24 of 36 passing for 240 yards for the Saints (5-1).\n\nMichael Thomas had eight receptions for 89 yards, and Alvin Kamara finished with 31 yards rushing while playing through an ankle injury.\n\nVIKINGS 38, EAGLES 20\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Kirk Cousins threw to Stefon Diggs for three of his four touchdowns, racking up a season-high 333 passing yards as Minnesota ravaged Philadelphia\u2019s secondary.\n\nDiggs scored on plays in the first half that covered 51 and 62 yards, becoming the first player since Randy Moss in 2000 to post two touchdown receptions of 50-plus yards in one game for the Vikings (4-2).\n\nHis most important catch came late in the third quarter, a double toe tap in the back of the end zone from 11 yards out that pushed the lead to 11 points after Carson Wentz and the Eagles (3-3) had pulled within 24-20 with 17 straight points.\n\nCousins went 22 for 29 with one sack and one interception on a deflected ball.\n\nThe Eagles have been badly missing starting cornerbacks Ronald Darby and Avonte Maddox, and Cousins took full advantage with a first half that looked at times like passing drills against the scout team.\n\nRAVENS 23, BENGALS 17\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) - Lamar Jackson ran for a career-high 152 yards and a touchdown, threw for 236 yards and guided Baltimore past hapless Cincinnati.\n\nJackson carried 19 times, including three kneel-downs, and finished tantalizingly short of Michael Vick\u2019s single-game record of 173 yards rushing by a quarterback.\n\nJackson now has three career 100-yard rushing games, tied with Billy Kilmer for most by a quarterback in his first two seasons since 1950.\n\nRegardless of where Jackson went, the Bengals (0-6) were usually a step behind. Jackson was also adept when throwing, going 21 for 33 without an interception.\n\nCincinnati jumped on top when Brandon Wilson took the opening kickoff 92 yards for a score, but Jackson responded quickly. Baltimore (4-2) finished with 497 yards of offense, and the Ravens retained sole possession of first place in the AFC North.\n\nPANTHERS 37, BUCCANEERS 26\n\nLONDON (AP) - Christian McCaffrey scored two touchdowns and Carolina turned five interceptions by Jameis Winston into 17 points as the Panthers beat Tampa Bay.\n\nAfter starting the season with two straight losses with hobbled Cam Newton at quarterback, the Panthers (4-2) have been on a roll with Kyle Allen at quarterback thanks to McCaffrey\u2019s big plays and an opportunistic defense that had a franchise record-tying seven takeaways on the day.\n\nBoth of those factors came up big on Carolina\u2019s first trip to London in front of a large contingent of Panthers fans for what was designated as a home game for the Bucs (2-4).\n\nWinston did most of his damage after the game got out of hand late, throwing for 400 yards with a 10-yard TD pass to Cameron Brate in the fourth quarter that gave him 100 touchdown passes in his career.\n\nREDSKINS 17, DOLPHINS 16\n\nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) - Rookie Terry McLaurin caught two touchdown passes and Washington stopped Miami\u2019s two-point conversion attempt with 6 seconds left in a matchup between winless teams.\n\nAdrian Peterson more than doubled his season rushing total with 118 yards for Bill Callahan in his first game as interim coach. Washington intercepted Josh Rosen twice and sacked him five times before he was benched at the start of the fourth quarter with the Dolphins trailing 17-3.\n\nRosen\u2019s replacement, Ryan Fitzpatrick, sparked a rally and led two touchdown drives, including a 75-yard march that began with 2:02 left. But after Fitzpatrick hit DeVante Parker for an 11-yard score to cut the deficit to one point, rookie coach Brian Flores decided to go for two.\n\nRunning back Kenyan Drake dropped Fitzpatrick\u2019s quick pass with several defenders between him and the goal line.\n\nWashington (1-5) looked like a different team after firing coach Jay Gruden, but the caliber of the opposition had something to do with that. The Dolphins (0-5) remained winless under Flores but helped their chances of securing the No. 1 draft pick in April.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Deshaun Watson threw for 280 yards and a touchdown while running for two more, outdueling Chiefs counterpart Patrick Mahomes in a matchup of former first-round picks and leading the Houston Texans to a 31-24 victory over Kansas City on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/texans_chiefs_football_78090_c0-186-4463-2789_s1200x700.jpg?23e3844cce3ad865201f7d89b797350e29582f81", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
