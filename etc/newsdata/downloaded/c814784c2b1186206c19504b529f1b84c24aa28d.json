And to do so, it collaborated with Amazon-popular tech brand Anker.\n\nThe Nebula soundbar joins Anker\u2019s Nebula product line, which thus far has focused on projectors. The Nebula Soundbar Fire TV Edition will be released Nov. 21 and you can pre-order it now for $230. With Alexa built-in and dual built-in subwoofers and a 2.1 channel design, this bar is going to fill your space with the perfect amount of sound. 4k HDR support means it can handle streaming up to 4k Ultra HD content through the easy-to-use Fire TV interface. This soundbar will essentially be an upgraded replacement for the all-new Fire TV Cube, which itself is an upgraded 2-in-1 replacement for both the Amazon Echo and Fire TV Stick. For a smart home entertainment upgrade that will elevate your smart assistant, smart audio, and smart streaming, the Nebula is the high-quality answer you\u2019ve been waiting for. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Scouted Newsletter Product recommendations that'll make your life better and tips to help you shop smarter.
