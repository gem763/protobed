Then he detonated his suicide vest, taking a few others with him, possibly members of his own family.\n\nTrump\u2019s performance was hardly dignified itself, but he was arguably fair to call the man an animal. Baghdadi was, after all, the most-wanted human rights criminal in the world, responsible for the murder, torture, rape and oppression of tens \u2013 even hundreds \u2013 of thousands of people.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe high profile cases of western aid workers and journalists were rightly mentioned \u2013 but Isis committed such acts on an industrial scale. And Isis was his creation as much as anyone\u2019s \u2013 the medieval caliphate with its gift for using cyberspace for propaganda was ruled by him. He sanctioned the beheadings broadcast live on the web. The world will be a better place without him.\n\nAnd yet we know, don\u2019t we, that the world will not be a safer place without him. Given the circumstances, it doesn\u2019t sound like it was possible to capture him and put him on trial for his crimes, which would have been far the better outcome. If America and the west believe in universal human rights, as Isis did not, then we could have set a new example to the world, demonstrating our superior, civilised standards. Instead, now the armed jihadists have another martyr.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Five things we know about Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Show all 5 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Indeed the very same vainglorious Donald Trump who took obscene personal credit for his death has put Isis back in business by his withdrawal of American forces from Syria and giving Erdogan the green light to beat the hell out of America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Now hundreds of hardened, trained, ruthless and cruel Isis fighters have been let loose in the region, at liberty to attack US forces and their allies wherever they find them, and to take fresh terror campaigns into Europe.\n\nIt is worth asking, then \u2013 is America at war with Isis or not? Does it want to defeat Islamist terror, or not? Why kill the leader but let his troops go free? Why thank the Kurds for their assistance in this targeted operation, yet betray them in their own homeland?\n\nFor Trump, it is all about Trump. In his sometimes bizarre press conference, he took excessive credit for the success of the operation, and lost no opportunity to put it in a favourable light compared to his predecessors. It was George W Bush\u2019s fault in the first place, supposedly, that Isis has gotten going because Bush ignored Trump\u2019s advice not to go into Iraq.\n\nThe death of Baghdadi is also supposed to be a bigger more prestigious deal than the assassination of Osama bin Laden in 2011 which was approved by Barack Obama. The truth of course is that neither Bush nor Obama eliminated the hydra of militant Islamist terror and aggression, and neither will Trump. Close down one organisation \u2013 the Taliban, Al-Qaeda \u2013 and a new one springs up; and sometimes the old ones go dormant and come back, \u201cfranchising\u201d their terror brand to volunteers anywhere on earth.\n\nThere was no such perspective for causation in Trump\u2019s windy bragging. The president even found the time to mention how successful his 12 books have been, to praise \u201ca canine\u201d, and, in return for their permission granted to America to act, to thank Putin and Erdogan. Yet Turkey and Russia are even now carving Syria up and persecuting the Kurds for their own amusement.\n\nAt such a moment, it is a reminder that Trump never rises to the occasion; the scale of even the most momentous of events will never be permitted to overshadow that vast ego if his.\n\nDepressingly, we also know that Trump will milk the death of Baghdadi for all it is worth, all the way to polling day: A great day for his country, Trump said, though he meant a great day for Trump.
