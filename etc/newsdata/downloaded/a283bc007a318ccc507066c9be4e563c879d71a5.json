I can't believe she's living with herself.\n\n\"We can't quite understand this is actually happening, or has been allowed to happen.\"\n\nFamily spokesman Radd Seiger said it is understood British authorities asked their US counterparts for immunity to be waived \"several times\".\n\nHe said: \"They've been told the answer is no, we've learnt via the police. The answer has come back as no.\"\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nIn a statement, the US Embassy in London said: \"We express our deepest sympathies and offer condolences to the family of the deceased in the tragic August 27 traffic accident involving a vehicle driven by the spouse of a US diplomat assigned to the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Embassy officials are in close contact with the appropriate British officials on this matter.\n\n\"Due to security and privacy considerations, we cannot confirm the identity of the individuals involved, but we can confirm the family has left the UK.\"", "description": "The suspect is said to have claimed diplomatic immunity and returned to the USA after Harry Dunn was killed outside RAF Croughton", "authors": ["Sam Elliott", "Image", "Universal News", "Europe", "Sky News", "Mark Thomas Rex", "Pa Archive Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20476486.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_US-diplomats-wife-leaves-UK-amid-police-probe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
