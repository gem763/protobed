No more baseball this season in Washington. You paid thousands of dollars to watch a World Series in this city for the first time in 86 years, and you got just that \u2014 the World Series.\n\nThere was no guarantee on your ticket that you would see the Washington Nationals actually WIN a World Series game.\n\nBut I\u2019m guessing you sort of expected the Nationals to win at least one of these three games. Instead, the local team went down in defeat for the third straight time Sunday night in Game 5 to the Houston Astros by the score of 7-1.\n\nThere was no guarantee that this Nationals offense that had gone through postseason opponents like a motorcycle gang wouldn\u2019t turn into offensive conscientious objectors \u2014 three runs in three games, a combined beating of 19-3\n\nI\u2019m guessing you expected more.\n\nNow you\u2019ll have to settle for long-distance hopes of survival, with Houston taking a 3-2 lead in the series and Game 6 Tuesday night at Minute Maid Park. Your hopes and dreams will be in the hands of Stephen Strasburg, Washington\u2019s Game 6 starter and postseason pitching icon. There are few better places for them to be.\n\nIf Washington manages to win the final two games of the series and clinches a World Series more than a thousand miles away in Houston, the memories of home field World Series disappointments will likely fade. After all, the Washington Capitals won their Stanley Cup in Las Vegas, and it didn\u2019t diminish the joy and celebration back here in Washington.\n\nBut if we\u2019re being honest \u2014 after the Nationals won the first two games of this series in Houston a combined score of 17-7, you had dreams of watching the Nationals win their first World Series title right here before your eyes, right? After all, you read about the overwhelming odds of teams with a 2-0 lead in a best-of-seven series going on to win the championship.\n\nNeed a reminder? 80 percent.\n\nOf course, those teams didn\u2019t have Max Scherzer scratched at the last minute from a start due to neck and back spasms.\n\nThe entire DMV may have suffered an earthquake-like spasm when the news broke around 4:30 Sunday afternoon that Scherzer would not be taking the mound against Gerritt Cole in Game 5.\n\nInstead it would be Joe Ross, who had Tommy John surgery at the end of 2017 and has been slowly recovering since, trying to find the form that showed promise when he was acquired in a trade, along with Trea Turner, from the San Diego Padres in December 2014. He went 4-4 this season with a 5.48 ERA in 27 appearances \u2014 nine as a starter.\n\nI\u2019m betting you didn\u2019t think you would be watching Joe Ross start the final game of this World Series to be played here in Washington. It went as you might have expected \u2014 four runs surrendered in five innings pitched.\n\nThere is still hope that the drugs and treatment that Scherzer is receiving will allow him to pitch in a Game 7 \u2014 if necessary.\n\nIf unnecessary, then the home field World Series disappointment of these three games will also likely fade \u2014 replaced by the jubilation of watching the Nationals clinch the National League pennant in Game 4 against the St. Louis Cardinals and the wonderful shock of seeing them come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Wild Card game against the Milwaukee Brewers to win 4-3. Those are Washington baseball moments that are lasting memories \u2014 new ones that haven\u2019t been experienced before.\n\nBut don\u2019t settle for those sweet dreams yet. Strasburg may have more good times in that golden arm of his, the one that has gone 3-0 this postseason and has established himself as one of the greatest playoff pitchers of all time \u2014 seven earned runs in 47 career postseason innings, a 1.34 ERA.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is to go out there and pound away and trust your stuff,\u201d Strasburg told reporters Sunday.\n\nPound away, baby. The last hopes and dreams of a magical season for Washington baseball fans will be riding on it.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
