It\u2019s scary.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think a lot of people realize how scary that can really be. You throw a baseball hard enough, hit somebody in the head when we\u2019re not looking, it can do some damage to you as a player. You throw a baseball from the third deck, it\u2019s got a little bit of movement on it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to see that as a player in the outfield. We\u2019re usually the ones throwing stuff at you.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely disrespectful, and at the same time, very unsafe.\u2019\u2019\n\nYankee fans jump on Astros right fielder Josh Reddick as he makes a catch.

Yet, it was no different, he said, than at any other time he has played at Yankee Stadium throughout his 12-year career.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all yelling at the same time so it all kind of mumbles together.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of expletives in there, but stuff I can\u2019t repeat.\u2019\u2019\n\nGAME 3: Cole magical again as Astros take 2-1 ALCS lead\n\nCORREA: Astros shortstop lost his mind saving Game 2\n\nReally, the only compliment Reddick could give the fans is their ability to navigate the internet and research his personal life.\n\n\u201cThey use Google really well,\u2019\u2019 said Reddick, with the fans knowing his wife\u2019s name, and even aware that they just had new twin sons. \u201cThey\u2019ve always been harsh on me. It\u2019s brutal.\u2019\u2019\n\nAstros manager A.J. Hinch informed the umpiring crew of the fan abuse, and the Yankees responded with a public-service announcement reminding the sell-out crowd of 48,998 that throwing objects on the field could result in ejections.\n\nStill, Reddick had his doubts that anything would happen, critical of security Monday in an interview with the Houston Chronicle.\n\n\u201cThe most frustrating part is there\u2019s no action taken,\u201d Reddick said. \u201cYou look at the security guards, they\u2019re just watching, not saying a thing to anybody. Hell, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they were the ones helping to say that. It\u2019s just a matter of circumstance to where they just let it ride.\u201d\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "Astros right fielder Josh Reddick was critical of the fans behavior at Yankees Stadium after Game 3 of the ALCS, calling it \"disrespectful.\"", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
