The Senate declared that the Russian activity online \u201cwas overtly and almost invariably supportive of then-candidate Trump, and to the detriment of Secretary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Russian activity was right up the Trump campaign\u2019s alley.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Election Day 2016, Trump campaign officials let on that they were surreptitiously undertaking a campaign to suppress the black vote, which heavily favored Clinton. Bloomberg reported a senior Trump campaign official acknowledging, \u201cWe have three major voter suppression operations under way.\u201d The official said the operations were targeted at three groups Clinton needed to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, African Americans and young women.\n\nBloomberg reported that on Oct. 24, a few weeks before the polls opened, the Trump campaign started placing spots on \u201cselect African American radio stations.\u201d The campaign produced a \u201cSouth Park\u201d-style animation of Clinton delivering her 1996 line about kids who join gangs, underscored with cartoon text: \u201cHillary Thinks African Americans are Super Predators.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe message went out to black voters via nonpublic Facebook \u201cdark posts\u201d \u2014 \u201conly the people we want to see it, see it,\u201d a campaign official said. The goal was to depress Clinton turnout, Bloomberg reported, and the campaign had the models to back up the plan.\n\nAnother example? Bloomberg also reported that the campaign tried to suppress black turnout in Miami\u2019s Little Haiti using messages related to the Clinton Foundation\u2019s operations in Haiti.\n\nThe confluence of the Russian operation with Trump\u2019s campaign was evident in the Senate committee\u2019s finding \u201cthat no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans. By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee was not alone in its findings.\n\nAD\n\nFormer special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who in 2018 filed a federal indictment on Russian activities as far back as 2014, also found that the Russians (like their Trump campaign counterparts) concentrated on encouraging blacks not to vote in the presidential election or to vote for a third-party candidate.\n\nOne example of a post to the Russia-controlled Instagram account \u201cWoke Blacks\u201d: \u201c[A] particular hype and hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we\u2019d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn the IRA\u2019s Instagram account \u201cBlacktivist\u201d: \u201cChoose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it\u2019s not a wasted vote.\u201d\n\nOn its \u201cUnited Muslims of America\u201d accounts: \u201cAmerican Muslims [are] boycotting elections today, most of the American Muslim voters refuse to vote for Hillary Clinton because she wants to continue the war on Muslims in the middle east and voted yes for invading Iraq.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDid the black-voter-suppression efforts of the Trump campaign and the Russians achieve the objective of reducing black voter turnout in 2016?\n\nFor the first time in 20 years, the black voter turnout rate in a presidential election declined. But Barack Obama wasn\u2019t on the ballot, and enthusiasm for Clinton was lukewarm \u2014 at best. A direct line between the Trump campaign and Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s operatives has not been established.\n\nAD\n\nBut this much is clear: No one could have appreciated the Russians\u2019 attempts at black voter suppression more than Trump.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t come out to vote for Hillary. They didn\u2019t come out. And that was a big \u2014 so thank you to the African American community,\u201d President-elect Trump taunted at a mostly white rally in Hershey, Pa., in December 2016.\n\nDoes Putin get a \u201cthank you,\u201d too?\n\nAD\n\nRead more from Colbert King\u2019s archive.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Both engaged in black-voter suppression efforts.", "authors": ["Colbert I.
