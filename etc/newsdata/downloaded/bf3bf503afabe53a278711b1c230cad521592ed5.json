James Paxton chilled Houston's bats and the bullpen followed with shutdown relief to beat the Astros 4-1 Friday night, cutting their AL Championship Series deficit to 3-2.\n\n\"I wasn't ready to go home yet,\" Paxton said, \"so I wanted to go out and give my team everything I had and just battle away.\"\n\nNow the teams rush to Texas, where the series resumes Saturday night without a day off. With pitching plans disrupted by a rainout earlier this week, both teams are expected to go all-bullpen in Game 6. But Gerrit Cole, 19-0 since May, looms as the Astros' starter on Sunday if New York manages to extend the matchup to the seven-game limit.\n\nPaxton, a fishing aficionado born outside Vancouver in Ladner, British Columbia, wore three-quarter-length sleeves on a night with a gametime temperature of 52 degrees. That was the coldest for a Verlander start since last year's ALCS opener at Boston \u2014 he had on long sleeves and half of Houston's fielders had hoodies or balaclavas.\n\nAfter lasting just 2 1/3 innings in Game 2, Paxton struck out nine in six innings, allowing four hits and four walks. Punching his pitching hand into his glove after big strikeouts, he saved his biggest emotion for his 112th and final pitch. Manager Aaron Boone had just made a trip to the mound, unsure whether he would make a change.\n\n\"He just said, 'Are you ready? Do you have anything more left in the tank?'\" Paxton said.\n\n\"And I said, 'Yeah, let's go. I want this.'\"\n\nRobinson Chirinos hit a first-pitch fastball that Brett Gardner caught in front of the left-field scoreboard with a runner on.\n\n\"When it first left the bat: 'Oh, no!'\" Boone remembered thinking to himself.\n\nAfter Tommy Kahnle allowed George Springer's one-out single in seventh and walked Jos\u00e9 Altuve, Zack Britton retired Michael Brantley and Alex Bregman. Britton struck out two in a perfect eighth, and Aroldis Chapman finished with a 1-2-3 ninth for the save.\n\nPaxton outpitched Verlander, an eight-time All-Star and former AL MVP and Cy Young Award winner. Verlander allowed a pair of first-inning homers for the first time in 28 postseason starts and gave up four runs in an inning for the first time since Houston acquired him from Detroit in August 2017.\n\n\"Fastball command wasn't very good, and the slider was just hanging,\" Verlander said.\n\nVerlander retired 10 in a row after Hicks' homer and wound up allowing five hits in seven innings with nine strikeouts and no walks.\n\nA night after the Yankees made four errors in one of their messier games of the season during an 8-3 loss, Paxton fell behind after 14 pitches. Springer reached on an infield hit, took second on Gary S\u00e1nchez's passed ball, advanced on a groundout and scored when Paxton bounced a breaking ball off S\u00e1nchez's glove for a wild pitch.\n\n\"A lot of nerves,\" Paxton said. \"I was just overthrowing a little bit early.\"\n\nNew York came out swinging against Verlander, who had been 4-0 with a 1.85 ERA against the Yankees in seven postseason starts.\n\nLeMahieu fouled off a pitch, then drove a fastball 355 feet to right-center for New York's first leadoff homer since Derek Jeter in 2009 ALCS against the Angels.\n\n\"LeMahieu took a couple big swings, hits the homer and woke up the building,\" Astros manager AJ Hinch said.\n\nAaron Judge singled and Gleyber Torres doubled. Verlander struck out Giancarlo Stanton, who went 0 for 3 without two strikeouts after missing three games with a strained right quadriceps.\n\nHicks, sidelined for more than two months by a right elbow injury that made his wonder whether he would need Tommy John surgery, made a surprise return for the ALCS and re-entered the starting lineup for Game 3. He fell behind 0-2, took three straight balls and sent a chest-high slider down the right-field line. He dropped his bat, turned and watched the ball, took a half-dozen slow steps toward first and started jogging after it clanked off the pole for his first home run since July 24.\n\n\"It curved a lot more than I thought it would,\" he said.\n\nNew York had never hit a pair of first-inning homers in 404 previous postseason games. Verlander could only crouch on the infield grass as Hicks circled the bases.\n\nHicks ended a stretch of 15 straight hitless at-bats for the Yankees with runners in scoring position. New York has relied on the long ball, scoring 12 of its 17 runs against the Astros on seven homers.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
