The Italian hooked at half time in a substitution surely done not in anger by boss Marco Silva, but in sympathy.\n\nEverton fans have clamoured to see more of Kean, but here we saw why he has been eased in gently.\n\nCombined, he and Alex Iwobi cost the Mersey club \u00a360m in the summer, but that is as far as their combination has gone so far.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHere, they were on such different wavelengths there weren\u2019t enough megahertz to cover the distance between them.\n\nThe home side were so lethargic, before the break, it even briefly encouraged Watford to conjure a chance of their own after 56 minutes when Andre Gray fired ferociously at Jordan Pickford.\n\nIn fact, the visitors should have been ahead by then, with Domingos Quina missing an easy chance when he shot wildly wide from a glorious position with time and space in front of goal.\n\nThe introduction of Walcott - how strange that he has gone from Goodison villain to hero in the space of a week - did inject some belief into the Blues, with a curling Andre Gomes left foot shot denied only by Adrian Mariappa on the line.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nThen Dominic Calvert-Lewin nodded cleverly down to Iwobi, whose sliced shot drifted onto the crossbar. Lucas Digne suffered the same fate soon after, when his deflected free kick also crashed against the woodwork.\n\nInevitably, it was Walcott who made the difference, his fine cross from the left, as Watford failed to clear a corner, was met with the force of a man who\u2019d had enough, as Holgate rammed his ferocious header home.\n\nRicharlison confirmed the victory when he raced from the half way line, as Watford finally pressed. And the over-riding emotion?
