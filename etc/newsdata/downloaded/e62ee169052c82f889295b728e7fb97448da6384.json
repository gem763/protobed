Kent said he tried to convey his opinion to Joe Biden\u2019s office, but that a staffer told him the vice president didn\u2019t have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d to address the issue because his other son, Beau, was battling cancer.\n\nThis is the first known instance in which a career diplomat tried to raise concerns regarding Hunter Biden\u2019s business holdings in Ukraine. Several of Joe Biden\u2019s former advisers also reportedly had discussions about whether his son\u2019s business dealings could be seen as a conflict of interest.\n\nA former senior Biden national-security aide dismissed the issue in comments to the Post.\n\n\u201cDid it have any effect on US policies, either on what we were doing or what the Ukrainians were doing? It didn\u2019t,\u201d the former aide said. \u201cIn the aggregate it didn\u2019t have any discernible effect.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have repeatedly urged Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens.\n\nHowever, Trump is currently the subject of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats into whether Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine to pressure the country to conduct the investigations.\n\nOn Thursday, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney appeared to confirm that the administration withheld aid to pressure Ukraine to look into interference in the 2016 presidential elections. Mulvaney quickly walked back his comments, denying there was a quid pro quo involved.", "description": "A former senior Biden national security aide dismissed the issue in comments to the\u00a0Washington Post.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
