It then intends spinning it off next year through a demerger, initial public offering or trade sale.\n\nOther companies who are part of the Lighter Wines push include Accolade Wines, owned by private equity giant Carlyle Group, Spy Valley Wines, Wither Hills, Villa Maria and Allan Scott Wines. Varieties include sauvignon blanc, pinot gris and rose\u2032.\n\nColes, through its First Choice and Liquorland stores, is also getting behind the Lighter Wines push.\n\nDr David Jordan, the program manager for NZ Lighter Wines, said the New Zealand grapegrowing climate meant that it had a head start.\n\n\"We have an advantage already,'' Dr Jordan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said customers were embracing the lower alcohol wines because they retained the full flavour and taste of higher alcohol content varieties.\n\n\"The full-strength equivalent would sit anywhere between 13 to 14.5 per cent,'' he said.\n\nHe said the reduction in alcohol level was between 25 to 30 per cent.\n\nThe beer industry in Australia had been a pioneer in introducing mid-strength and lower alcohol varieties and New Zealand wine producers aimed to replicate the success using lower alcohol wines.\n\n\"Australia has already been in this space with beer,'' Dr Jordan said.\n\nFigures from industry body Wine Australia show that over the past 20 years NZ wine exports to Australia have risen from 2.7 million litres to 56.5 million, with a large part of it stemming from sauvignon blanc from the Marlbough region.\n\nNew Zealand wine represents 56 per cent of Australia's total wine imports.\n\nThe 18 New Zealand producers who are part of the drive are aiming high, and aspire to capture 10 per cent market share of the global market between 2025 to 2030.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile most of the wines are centred on white wine varieties, Forrest Wines has been able to make a Pinot Noir with an alcohol content of 9.5 per cent.\n\nMainstream beer consumption in Australia is at 70-year lows, although the craft beer segment is growing strongly at between 15 to 20 per cent.", "description": "18 Kiwi wineries are cutting alcohol levels by up to 30 per cent in some varieties in a 'Lighter Wine' push taking off in Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_2.9505%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_71/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4d18b7a7cade7b73429b94d503137c08ca78dc2a", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
