It was the isolated leader\u2019s first appearance in the newly reopened legislature, refurbished to the tune of $5 million after protesters ransacked it in July.\n\nLegislative Council president Andrew Leung adjourned the meeting barely minutes after it had begun after opposition legislators started chanting slogans, hurling abuse and used a projector to beam slogans onto the chamber wall. Several legislators were ejected from the chamber and cries of \u201cCarrie Lam, step down!\u201d were heard.\n\nLam\u2019s speech was expected to focus on affordable housing\u2014the lack of which has helped fuel the raging discontent behind five months of anti-government protests. Her failure to give the address marks a sharp deterioration of Hong Kong\u2019s already fractious politics.\n\nSpeaking to reporters afterward, democratic lawmaker Tanya Chan said: \u201cI really urge [Lam], if she can\u2019t govern Hong Kong, and has no determination to govern Hong Kong, and no ability or even capability of administrating Hong Kong, to please step down. This is the only way we can have a good future, the only way Hong Kong can go forward. Please, please Carrie Lam, please don\u2019t let us suffer anymore. Please go.\u201d\n\nLegislator Claudia Mo, said, \u201cOne, she [Lam] has no more right, no more authority, to govern Hong Kong, and the second thing is that she doesn\u2019t understand Hong Kong. She is just a puppet on strings, being played by Beijing.\u201d\n\nAdded lawmaker Eddie Chu: \u201cHong Kong people can no longer tolerate such a legislature, such a chef executive. I am very happy that, together with the democrats, we were able to chase Carrie Lam out the chamber today.\u201d\n\nFearing disruptions, the Legislative Council had issued an amber alert prior to the the meeting, effectively barring the public from observing the proceedings and placing restrictions on the movements of lawmakers\u2019 staff within the building.\n\nA small group of protesters from the radical League of Social Democrats gathered outside the legislature beforehand. \u201cThe deep-rooted problem is that power lies in the hands of a small group of people, and that power is abused,\u201d said party figurehead and former legislator Leung Kwok-hung to assembled reporters. He repeated a demand for Lam to hold an independent probe into alleged police brutality, calling it \u201cthe most important thing at this moment.\u201d\n\nThe fiasco at the legislature comes at a time of sky-high political tensions in Hong Kong. More than 2,500 people have been arrested, and hundreds injured, since protests erupted over a controversial, but now withdrawn, extradition bill in June. Early demonstrations against the bill quickly escalated into a general rebellion against Lam\u2019s Beijing-backed administration. Many protesters are demanding full democracy and self-determination or even independence for the former British possession, which was retroceded to China in 1997 after 156 years of colonial rule.\n\nIn recent weeks, protesters have become increasingly violent, smashing government offices and mainland-Chinese owned businesses, paralyzing the city with sustained attacks on the subway system, and detonating, police say, an improvised explosive device. Police arrested two men Wednesday at an apartment where explosives were found.\n\nA high school student has also been arrested for slashing a policeman on the neck with a box cutter during a protest, and police have wounded two young protesters in separate shootings.\n\nIn an attempt to quell the protests, the government two weeks ago invoked emergency powers to ban the wearing of masks at public gatherings, but the measure has sparked even greater fury.\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing says it will respond forcefully if the U.S. Congress passes the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The measure allows for sanctions on Hong Kong officials who are held to be working against the enclave\u2019s \u201cfundamental freedoms and autonomy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis kind of behavior has grossly interfered in China\u2019s internal affairs and is openly adding support to the opposition forces and radical forces in Hong Kong,\u201d an official at the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reportedly stated.\n\nLam\u2019s administration voiced its \u201cregret\u201d at the passage of the act through the House of Representatives.\n\nStory continues", "description": "After months of violent anti-government protests, Hong Kong's political crisis shows no sign of abating", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0k02SvLcrBXA1.XVf4_Mzw--~B/aD01NTA0O3c9ODI1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/b2d3a01858892a2c1f1cf3c023ec2d73", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
