Historically it was spend in going emotionally overboard in turning Gandhi into a God he is not, and now there is clear shift of making a devil out of him that too, he surely is not.\n\nIf Gandhiji deserved a label, it is of an economist, an environmental economist, to be specific, and before he is buried under the confusion about his role in getting India freed from British rule, Gandhi the economist needs to be salvaged, for the world that needs him more than ever today.\n\nWe need Gandhi today, not for peace and not even for non-violence, not for civil liberties and not even for social reforms, as there are enough champions to each of these causes, but his one cause still lacks a champion, and that is a champion economist who understands that the role of economics is to help humans to form a society and not a market.\n\nAs I look around, we seem to be gripped by the strangest schizophrenia possible, because we have the same set of people crusading against climate change in one breath and complaining about world economy shading a point or two from its already rapid economic growth in the next.\n\nWe are worried about the planet dying of a fever and we are also upset if the fever comes down even a wee bit, and the reason behind it is the economists of the world.\n\nIf we look at Gandhian thoughts, they are not proposed by the Mahatma as part of economic theory, and yet they have more economics in them than an IMF conference room, only qualitatively different.\n\nGandhi has always talked about social action, and he has used economics for what it should be, i.e. a tool for building human and humane society.\n\nUnfortunately for us, as we move from Mohan to Rajan, we see a completely new direction of pursuit amongst the new age economists and that is not to look at human collective as a society with humane values but consider it worthy only to be turned into a market where market forces replace social values to provide it with a dynamics.\n\nToday, thanks to this new brand of economics now popular in Ivey league classrooms, we are now living in a society where the right or wrong is not linked with social morality because the new idea of freedom of choice demands that we now look at market forces to decide on our behalf.\n\nThe net result is, we sell and buy everything with no moral restriction in place. From naked female bodies to lung-wrecking cigarettes, from social inhibition-numbing alcohol to planet-wrecking pesticides, everything can be sold, and everyone successfully making a profitable deal is a hero.\n\nAs we move forward with what we like to call an age of freedom, we are making a strange mistake, and that is about the forum for expressing this freedom that we love so much.\n\nToday, the expression of choice of human society is done in a marketplace. Demand is a new truth, new morality and new driver of humanity.\n\nThis means that money is the new voice of the people and rich hold an obvious monopoly over it. The new human collective is now a market that wants to drink sugary drinks and eat fattening food and worlds best minds are engaging in ensuring that they are made available to people.\n\nWe have become blind to our irrationality that we have a planet with 30 million blind people who can\u2019t even move on their own and we are investing a fortune in self-driving cars that sighted don\u2019t actually need.\n\nWhile finding a technology to prevent rape would have changed the lives of half of humanity completely, we invest more money in making more and more cosmetics for women that don\u2019t even work.\n\nWe live in an age where business leaders have replaced moral leaders that the new-age youth hopes to emulate. We fail to recognise that a business leader has profit as his/her objective and not the social well-being of humanity.\n\nThis problem is not caused because of the masses, as they have little role to choose the direction of where we need to go, it is the job of the elites, the economists, to think about what should be the way we design economic policies that help us form equitable human society instead of a growing market and galloping index.\n\nWhile the world may feel the need for listening to the economic theories for growth, we in India need to start rethinking. A world where elites economists sit and theorise is not half as poor as our nation. We need to start thinking about Gandhian objective of economics to help us in preventing becoming a market place.\n\nWe need economics to serve humans as Mohan hoped for, instead of humans serving the economics of Rajan.\n\nWe need a rock star economist to arrive on the scene and bring a paradigm shift in economic policies of the world, just as Gandhi did in the age without mass communism purely by his authenticity.", "description": "Gandhi-Jayanti this year seems to have a different flavour.
