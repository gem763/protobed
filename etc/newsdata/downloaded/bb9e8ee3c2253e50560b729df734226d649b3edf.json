I mean, I mustn't suggest that the whole of the ERG [the Brexiteer European Research Group] is male. It\u2019s not, because there are plenty of women in it as well. But it did feel like we had a second female prime minister being pushed out by a group of men at the time.\"\n\n\u201cI think there absolutely is a whiff of sexism\" about May's departure, Rudd said. She said it was \"difficult\" to work out \"how much is about a more trusting relationship that they clearly have with Boris Johnson, because he himself was very much part of that ERG group in terms of wanting a harder Brexit than the former prime minister wanted, but I do feel as a woman who's active in politics myself, that there is a whiff of sexism, as you put it, as well.\u201d\n\nShe also said that Johnson's \"aggressive behavior ... may be the sort of thing that a group of ERG men, particularly, wanted to see.\u201d\n\nRudd, a former home secretary, resigned as secretary of state for work and pensions and quit the Conservative Party in July because of how Johnson approached Brexit and his decision to kick out 21 senior Tories who refused to back him in the House of Commons.\n\nShe told Barnett she hasn't decide whether or not to stand as an independent candidate in the next general election.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s \u2018aggressive behaviour\u2019 may appeal to men in the Brexiteer European Research Group, says Amber Rudd.", "authors": ["Paul Dallison", "Eleni Courea"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-687190208-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
