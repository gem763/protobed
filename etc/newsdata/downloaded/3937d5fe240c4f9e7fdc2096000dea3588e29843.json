But also why it chose to do so.\n\nIt\u2019s a question that\u2019s still unresolved despite a sea of focus groups and opinion polls, despite a swamp of articles about distant elites and \u201cleft behinds.\u201d Everyone has a theory, normally one that fits their world view \u2014 on immigration, on austerity, on sovereignty or whatever else.\n\nBut can any of them really explain why one of my older mates got himself registered, got out of his house and went and voted for the very first time in June 2016 (It was also his last trip to the ballot box, he said. \u201cI\u2019m 1-0 up and I\u2019m quitting while I\u2019m ahead.\u201d)\n\nWe\u2019d never even heard him mention the EU before. And there were millions like him. Friends of Dominic Cummings say the Brexit referendum was the first time the campaign director for Vote Leave and now chief adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson cast a ballot.\n\nWhy? What on earth happened?\n\nObviously, Britain\u2019s hopeless train service didn\u2019t actually trigger the Leave vote. But it might be indicative of a something broader.\n\nClues can be found in the soaraway success of Cummings\u2019 greatest work, a campaign slogan that resonated more strongly than any other in modern British political history: \u201cTake back control.\u201d\n\nInstead of spending three years throwing rocks at one another about backstops and people\u2019s votes, the political class would have been wise to do a little more thinking about just why Cummings\u2019 slogan worked so well.\n\nAcross the rest of Europe too, it feels like little of the hard thinking has been done. It\u2019s so much easier to blame lying Brexiteers than to consider why 17 million people in one of the bloc\u2019s richest member states were so disillusioned with the carefully constructed Union that they preferred a leap into the unknown.\n\nOf course, Brexit is complicated. People voted Leave for a multitude of reasons. But we do know one thing for sure: Whatever other motives they might have had, the British people voted to take back control.\n\nThree years on, is anybody doing anything about it?\n\nDisconnect\n\nTwo weeks touring Brexit-voting constituencies for London Playbook was never going to provide a pat answer, nor an easy solution to where we go from here. But it did offer up some nice lines to chuck into the bubbling pot.\n\nMy favorite came from Melanie Onn, the Remain-voting MP for the Brexit-backing port of Grimsby.\n\nShe grew up in the town; all her family live there; she knows the place inside out. Her theory is that when people voting to leave cast their ballots against the distant elites, their target was actually much closer to home.\n\n\u201cBefore I became MP here, I remember talking to people about how they felt things were stacked against them, a sense of unfairness,\u201d she told me.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get to see anybody face to face any more,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is done remotely, and there is a frustratingly long process of being put on hold, or you have to go through the internet, which was a bit of a battle for lots of people.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that fed all the way through, whether it was their council, their bank, their GP, their electric company,\u201d she said. \u201cOr whether it was their politicians.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the EU symbolized all of that remoteness \u2014 decisions being made on their behalf they didn\u2019t have any sense of connection to whatsoever,\u201d she continued. \u201cEven if the rules the EU brought in were relatively inconsequential to their lives, it didn\u2019t matter. They were making decisions that they felt should have been made closer to home and that they should have had some say over in some way.\u201d\n\nAngry and angsty\n\nI was pondering Onn\u2019s call-center theory while stuck on yet another overcrowded train across England a few days later.\n\nI stopped writing about every dire train journey in my daily Playbook dispatches because eventually it gets boring. But regular readers will know they were a dominant feature of the two-week tour.\n\nPopular perception here is the problem is all about delays. But it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s the multiple cancellations of services people depend on; it\u2019s the tiny little train crammed with far too many passengers, making everybody\u2019s journey miserable.\n\nAfter I\u2019d made this point in Playbook for the umpteenth time, a WhatsApp message arrived from a long-time reader up north: \u201cTheory: Brits are angry and angsty (see binge drinking and violence) because they have to suffer awful public transport experiences daily.\u201d \u201cI was just reading Playbook on a tiny, jam-packed, hot and stuffy, two-carriage Pacer train (around 30 years old) \u2014 you know the type with the benches that bounces around,\u201d the message continued. \u201cI\u2019d also been hoping to do some work on the way home ... no chance. Instead you just get angry and arrive feeling grim. No wonder everyone\u2019s depressed. And the alternative is sitting in traffic!\u201d\n\nObviously, Britain\u2019s hopeless train service didn\u2019t actually trigger the Leave vote. But it might be indicative of a something broader, something Cummings tapped into with such great effect.\n\nWhat could be more symbolic of an out-of-control era than the sight of Chris Grayling, the (now former) transport secretary, sitting before an elected body of MPs following a total network failure, calmly telling them he is not in charge of the railways?\n\nThere is no \u201ctaking back control\u201d of your daily commute. Somewhere, a faceless civil servant has agreed a complex contract with a multinational transport company. Your train driver is as angry and as helpless as you are. There\u2019s no alternative, and no way out. No wonder people are angry.\n\nLocal concerns\n\nThere is plenty the national government could do. Leave-voting Bradford has a council leader, Susan Hinchliffe, working night and day to bring her city up to speed with its wealthier (and Remain-voting) neighbors Leeds and Manchester. But she needs the tools to do it.\n\nA city center stop on the proposed new Leeds-Manchester rail line is essential to trigger real urban regeneration, she told me. But she is reduced to begging the Department for Transport to see sense.\n\nCivic leaders across Yorkshire would love to take back control; but for all the talk, meaningful devolution never reached these parts. And, of course, it\u2019s not just trains. From North Yorkshire to North Shropshire, I heard about campaigns to have key roads widened which have gone on for decades.\n\nThe lack of capacity is holding back economic development in areas that urgently need it. Yet nothing ever happens. Again, they are reduced to begging Westminster for support.\n\nThe Treasury\u2019s inflexible approach to project funding \u2014 the dreaded \u201cgreen book\u201d \u2014 was raised time and again by local politicians.\n\nWhitehall officials use this well-meaning system for cost-benefit analyses to ensure value for money and maximize GDP growth. The trouble is that it inevitably favors wealthier, more highly populated areas \u2014 basically London and the South East.\n\nThe sense of frustration is palpable when you speak to business leaders in other regions about this stuff \u2014 they are seething. They look at the \u00a318 billion Crossrail project being built across London and then read about developing plans for Crossrail 2, and they get angrier still.\n\nGhost towns\n\nAnother issue that came up time and again as I spoke to MPs and people in struggling towns around England was the state of the high street: boarded-up shops; rows of bookies and vape stores where there used to be a bustling town center.\n\nIn Westminster, this kind of stuff is far down the priority list. But in much of the country, it\u2019s something people talk about all the time. It\u2019s hard to see how the EU can be blamed \u2014 take a look instead at a flatlining economy and the rise of internet shopping. But it plays into a sense of declining civic pride, a feeling that things are not as good as they used to be.\n\nThere are efforts to push back against the decline. In the Pennine town of Halifax, local MP Holly Lynch showed me how a series of major regeneration projects have transformed the town center and brought tourists flocking in. People feel the place is on the up.\n\nBut in south Wales coalfield towns like Port Talbot and Blaenavon, in Yorkshire\u2019s more down-at-heel centers like Bradford and Grimsby, the opposite is true.\n\nMany saw it as their first opportunity to affect real change, and they may well have been right.\n\nLocal politicians showed me their big ideas \u2014 a regeneration project in Bradford, a ports revival in Grimsby, a cutting-edge art gallery in Port Talbot \u2014 but they do not have the power or the funding to implement them without serious Westminster support.\n\nSometimes it is forthcoming; mostly it is not. The dynamic leaves these towns at the mercy of market forces that have proven an incredible force for development and wealth creation overall, but which can leave people in struggling areas feeling utterly powerless when the tide turns against them.\n\nThere\u2019s a more fundamental issue, too, about trying to build up well-paid jobs in places where the industries of the 19th and 20th centuries have been lost.\n\nSpeak to the handful of engineering firms paying decent wages in low-pay places like Scarborough and they will tell you that training up local skills is key to their growth.\n\nBut there are few issues less glamorous on the political agenda. Neither Westminster nor Fleet Street seem to care. Again, local leaders say local control over training budgets is needed, to drive the workforce in a targeted direction. Some areas are making progress; others are not.\n\nUnaccountable elites\n\nNone of this is to suggest the Brexit vote was not a vote against the EU. Of course, it was. People know an unaccountable elite when they see one and are happy to vote against it, regardless of whether they actually care about the rules governing \u201cstandards of paint,\u201d as Melanie Onn puts it.\n\nMany saw it as their first opportunity to affect real change, and they may well have been right.\n\nBack in Leave-supporting North Shropshire, the Brexiteer MP Owen Paterson has a story he loves to tell about the day of the Brexit vote.\u201cOn polling day, I saw the returning officer and asked him how it was going,\u201d Paterson told me. \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s extraordinary.\u2019 I asked why. He said, \u2018I\u2019ve just never seen anything like it. It\u2019s quite unlike any election we\u2019ve ever had. We\u2019ve just never seen such numbers.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe official told Paterson how he literally had to show people how to vote. \u201c\u2018They\u2019ve never done it before,\u2019 Paterson was told. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nPaterson headed to a polling station to see for himself. \u201cI was there with my Vote Leave stickers on, and people were going in stern faced, but they were coming out beaming, \u2018We did it!\u2019,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd the best bit at the end was these guys coming off a building site. Boots covered in dust. No messing around. \u2018Good to see you Mr. Paterson, good to see you.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd then one of them said: \u2018It\u2019s about them, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u2019 And he\u2019s pointing outside. \u2018It\u2019s about them.\u2019 I said sorry, who\u2019s them?\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s about them. You can\u2019t do anything about them. They tell you what to do. We can get rid of you Mr. Paterson. But we can\u2019t get rid of them.\u2019\u201d\n\nPaterson shrugged. \u201cAnd in my view, it was as simple as that,\u201d he said.\n\nGive back control\n\nThere\u2019s nothing simple about Brexit, of course, as the past three years have conclusively shown.\n\nBut as the nation gears up for a final battle to the death over how and indeed whether Britain leaves the EU, all sides of this ugly debate need to start thinking seriously about this promise of control.\n\nBrexit, assuming it happens, can be used to reset the clock on some of Britain\u2019s ailments, but it\u2019s going to take bravery and imagination from national politicians and, crucially, a willingness to give away much of the power \u2014 the control \u2014 they spent their lifetime grasping to achieve.\n\nThe Whitehall machine clings tightly to the levers of state \u2014 the Treasury, the department for transport, the ministry of housing, communities and local government are all complicit.\n\nHow many politicians win power only to give it away?\n\nBy accident or design, Cummings struck a nerve with the British public like few campaigners before him.\n\nWhatever the outcome now \u2014 hard Brexit or soft; Leave or Remain \u2014 it is time for politicians to deliver.\n\nLondon Playbook is POLITICO\u2019s must-read daily briefing on what\u2019s driving the day in the U.K. capital.
