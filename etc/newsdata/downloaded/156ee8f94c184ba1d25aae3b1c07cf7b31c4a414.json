I talked about that as part of my mistake in the situation, but it was like a punch in the gut because I thought I had this trust for 12 years and love. It was the hardest thing of ever had to face, it was like someone calling you and telling you that a family member had tragically died.\n\nHowever, under the alienation of affection laws in North Carolina, cheating on a married person that ends up in divorce is considered illegal.\n\nThe laws, more commonly known as the \u201chomewrecker\u201d or \u201cheartbalm\u201d laws, are also held as sacred in Hawaii, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Dakota, and Utah.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s alienation of affection laws date back to the 1800s and follow English law from 1745 when wives were considered their husband\u2019s property.\n\nHoward\u2019s attorney, Cindy Mills, told reporters that the defendant laughed when the case was brought before the court:\n\nI said, \u2018Do you find something funny about this process?\u2019 That\u2019s very dangerous perception to have because the same person who laughed in that deposition, that defendant now has a $750,000 judgment against them, so I don\u2019t think he\u2019s laughing now.\n\nHoward said that the man who seduced his wife \u201ccame to my house and ate dinner with us,\u201d adding that they also talked about their personal lives.\n\n\u201cI believe in the sanctity of marriage,\u201d he noted. \u201cOther families should see what the consequences are to not only breaking the vow to whatever religion you subscribe to, but also your legal responsibilities.\u201d\n\nIn August, a Pitt County Superior judge ordered the defendant, Greg Jernigan, to pay Howard $750,000 in damages.\n\n\u201cI filed this case because I believe it\u2019s very important that people understand that sanctity of marriage is importan, especially in this day and age when people question everyone\u2019s morals, people questions everyone\u2019s liability of a person, and the state backed me up on it,\u201d Howard concluded.", "description": "A divorced man in Pitt County, North Carolina, won $750,000 after he sued the man he claimed broke up his marriage.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Homewrecker-Law-Suit-Awarded-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
