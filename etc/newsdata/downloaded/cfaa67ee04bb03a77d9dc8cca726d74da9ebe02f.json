It also hiked its price target on the Next shares from 5,600p to 6,000p.\n\nIn May, Next posted a 4.5% jump in overall sales for the first three months, which easily topped the 3.2% forecast. The company claimed the unusually warm weather over Easter assisted the business.\n\nBut the warm weather still wasn\u2019t enough to help out the high street division, which saw sales slide by 3.6%. Next isn\u2019t the only company suffering from poorer sales on the high street, it is in fact becoming the norm for the industry.\n\nOn a more positive note, online sales increased by more than 11% in the three month period, which is a clear sign the company is changing with the times. Next will release its first-half figures on Thursday, and traders will want to see if the positive run has been maintained.\n\nThe Next share price has been pushing higher throughout 2019, and good numbers on Thursday could see it retest the 6,227p area.\n\nThe retail sector has taken a knock recently, partially due to e-commerce, but also because of consumers spending less on account of the uncertainty over Brexit. The economic indicators show the jobs market is very strong \u2013 the jobless rate is the lowest since the 1970s, but people are curtailing their spending.\n\nIn recent months, Ted Baker (LON: ) issued a profit warning, Topshop and Topman posted an annual loss, in addition to Primark posting a quarterly fall in like-for-like sales. Looking away from the traditional fashion houses, Boohom (LON: ), the online retailer, registered a 40% jump in full-year profit in April, plus earlier this month it upped its revenue guidance.\n\nneed to take a leaf out of Boohoo\u2019s book, as online shopping is taking off. Footfall on the high street as well as at shopping centres is in decline, so perhaps Next might look to close underperforming stores.\n\nIf the business is able to successfully increase its online sales, it could further help the Next share price. Online shopping is attractive for businesses on account of the lower costs, but it must be run effectively, otherwise it can cause major headaches for management.\n\nASOS (LON: ) issued two profit warnings this year, which were partially triggered by an \u2018overhaul of the infrastructure\u2019. Investor confidence in the company suffered because of stock shortages in the US, as well as issues in the switching from manual orders to automated orders in Germany.\n\nOcado (LON: ), the online grocery, took a hit earlier this year when a fire broke out at its operating site in Andover. E-commerce has its advantages, but it also has its own issues, hence the smoother running of the business is essential.\n\nThe CEO Simon Wolfson confirmed the group is prepared for a no-deal Brexit, which has assured traders to some extent, as there is chatter that some businesses are nowhere near ready for such an event. Mr Wolfson feels the tariffs on EU imports will be balanced-out by the drop in levies from non-EU countries, so the blow might be cushioned.\n\nThe fashion house was hit hard by the slump in the pound on the back for the EU referendum in 2016. Sterling\u2019s sizeable fall paved the way for Next paying up to 12% more for goods. The Next share price was hit hard by the EU referendum result, but is now up over 13% from pre-referendum levels.\n\nThere is speculation a no-deal Brexit could hurt the pound once again, but no doubt the firm has learned its lesson from three years ago and will take this into account going forward.\n\nDISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution-only provider.
