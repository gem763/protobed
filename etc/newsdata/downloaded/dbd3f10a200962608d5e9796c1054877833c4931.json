I'm trying to look for simple jobs to get experience, but even simple jobs like some in retail or support work for basic pay, have been hard.\n\n\"I've gone to career services and they've told me my CV was fine but after a few applications I've become quite disheartened.\"\n\nImage caption Careers Wales' Denise Currell had not expected to be talking about bias in recruitment in 2019\n\nMohamad had started to get anxious about his appearance if he did get an interview.\n\n\"I've had family members telling me maybe it's your beard - maybe try shaving off your beard that might help,\" he said.\n\n\"But I don't want to shave my beard just to get a job. I don't want to change myself just for a job.\"\n\nChisomo Phiri, from the All Wales BAME Engagement Programme, believed she too had fallen victim to recruitment bias, before finding her current job though university contacts.\n\n\"I just wasn't hearing anything back,\" she said.\n\nThe only reason she could think of was her name.\n\n\"I think if you're from an ethnic minority background and you seek out employment then you already feel like you're in second place,\" she said.\n\nLegal and General employs about 1,800 people in Cardiff. Not being as representative of the community as it would like meant \"something is not working somewhere.\"\n\nImage caption Ali Abdi, of Cardiff Citizens, said residents were not getting a \"proper response\" when applying for jobs despite being qualified\n\nThe firm's Odessa Barthorpe said by working with groups like Cardiff Citizens it hoped it could improve recruitment methods to attract black and ethnic minority applicants.\n\nMs Barthorpe said: \"We have a responsibility, along with all the other companies in Cardiff, to make sure we are doing the things that we need to do to have a level playing field for everybody.\"\n\nMs Currell urged businesses to adopt blind application because she said a degree of unconscious bias is often unavoidable for any recruiter.\n\n\"It's completely unethical to allow those biases to spill into your recruitment practices, especially if you want to get the best candidate for the job,\" she said.\n\n\"We all have unconscious bias - we can't get away from that - so why not make it impossible to spill into your recruitment practices.\n\n\"There's no cost to this. I would have thought businesses, by now, would have understood that they get benefits from having this diverse workforce - and from having the best candidate for the role.\"", "description": "Young people from ethnic minority communities fear their names have led to them missing out on jobs.", "authors": ["Will Fyfe", "Bbc Wales News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C967/production/_108995515_de29.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
