Three Russian journalists were killed last year while investigating Wagner activities in the Central African Republic.\n\nWorking with data provided by Facebook, the observatory identified 73 pages that tried to \u201cfoster unity around Russia-aligned actors and politicians\u201d in the CAR, Libya, Sudan, Madagascar, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo. They were liked by more than 1.7 million accounts and had 9.7 million interactions on 48,800 post put up since December.", "description": "A Russia-linked Facebook influence campaign has targeted African countries where Russian military advisors, mercenaries and political consultants are reportedly operating, including Libya and Mozambique, according to cyber threat experts.", "authors": ["Alec Luhn", "Allister Heath", "David Goodhart", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000155305879-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwD2sfO9joeQ6RY-qlTATNHeLmk34TsuaM0PGdT5mR28.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
