Speaking with the New York Times about his upcoming memoir, Van Ness also opened up surviving sexual assault and overcoming his drug addiction.\n\n\"It's hard for me to be as open as I want to be when there are certain things I haven't shared publicly,\" he said. \"These are issues that need to be talked about.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old revealed he was diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25, after fainting at his job at a hair salon. He then went to Planned Parenthood with flu-like symptoms. \"That day was just as devastating as you would think it would be,\" he writes in his memoir, according to the Times.\n\nVan Ness' memoir, \"Over the Top,\" delves deeper into his life story, from struggling to accept himself as a kid in Illinois to eventually being cast on \"Queer Eye.\" He now describes himself as a proud \"member of the beautiful HIV-positive community.\"\n\nVan Ness also shared his story about being sexually abused at a young age by an older boy from church and experiencing homophobic bullying at school.\n\nThe \u201cQueer Eye\u201d star Jonathan Van Ness opens up to The New York Times about being an addict, a sexual abuse survivor and H.I.V. positive https://t.co/WdEJ6oQeGG \u2014 The New York Times (@nytimes) September 21, 2019\n\n\"For a lot of people who are survivors of sexual assault at a young age, we have a lot of compounded trauma,\" he said.\n\nAs a teenager, Van Ness said he would meet older men online for sex. He developed binge-eating disorder after the death of his stepfather. He exchanged sex for money in college to feed his cocaine habit.\n\nVan Ness said he flunked out of college after his freshman year, turning to beautician school instead.

I do feel the need to talk about this.\"", "description": "\"These are issues that need to be talked about,\" Van Ness said", "authors": ["Sophie Lewis"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/21/8de285a5-730b-4046-85c7-39cc8dd7d5a0/thumbnail/1200x630/1ed1e82e1cf8580d48c9e7dfd9191c2a/gettyimages-1164295667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
