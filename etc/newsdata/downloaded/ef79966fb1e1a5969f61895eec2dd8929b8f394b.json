Keith Wildhaber $19,970,000 in damages after he filed a lawsuit against the department that accused it of discrimination and retaliation.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to send a message,\u201d the jury foreman told reporters following the verdict, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \u201cIf you discriminate you are going to pay a big price. \u2026 You can\u2019t defend the indefensible.\u201d\n\nWildhaber was passed over 23 times for a promotion, despite \u201cstellar\u201d performance reviews and him qualifying for the lieutenant position based on the position\u2019s criteria, according to a copy of his lawsuit obtained by HuffPost.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS St. Louis County police Sgt. Keith Wildhaber is seen during the trial of his discrimination case against the county in Clayton, Missouri.\n\nIn 2014 he underwent a test and assessment for the position and was ranked No. 3 out of 26 total candidates. Of the top nine candidates to make consideration, seven of them were promoted, with Wildhaber being one of the two who were not. The other officer is said to have had disciplinary issues.\n\nWildhaber said he was eventually told by a member of the county\u2019s Board of Police Commissioners, which oversees the police chief, that his sexuality was holding him back and he\u2019d have to change to advance.\n\n\u201cThe command staff has a problem with your sexuality. If you ever want to see a white shirt [i.e. get a promotion], you should tone down your gayness,\u201d now-former Commissioner John Saracino is quoted as having told him.\n\nSaracino has denied having such a conversation with Wildhaber, according to St. Louis\u2019 Riverfront Times.\n\nWildhaber eventually filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a month later he said he was reassigned from his afternoon shift to an overnight one at a precinct that was nearly 30 miles from his home.\n\nHe went on to file another complaint, this one for unlawful retaliation. His complaint accused the department of punishing him because he \u201cdoes not fit the stereotypical norms of what a \u2018male\u2019 should be.\u201d\n\nKate Munsch / Reuters St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, seen in 2015, is facing calls to step down following allegations of homophobia within his department.\n\nSeveral witnesses during Wildhaber\u2019s trial also testified of having overheard and experienced similar homophobic comments and retaliation within the police department, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.\n\nSt. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, who over his six years as police chief has weathered heavy criticism and lawsuits over his department\u2019s handling of the Ferguson protests in 2014 and 2015, testified that Wildhaber\u2019s lawsuit was a factor in him not being promoted, according to the Post-Dispatch.\n\nCounty Councilwoman Lisa Clancy on Sunday called on Belmar to resign while accusing him of overseeing a \u201cculture of rampant racism and homophobia.\u201d\n\nThe following day, Roland Corvington, chairman of the county\u2019s Board of Police Commissioners, called Wildhaber\u2019s trial \u201cembarrassing\u201d and resigned after serving seven years on the board, the Dispatch reported.\n\nI sincerely believe the jury\u2019s decision to award this verdict was a wake-up call to the department and its leadership. Roland Corvington\n\n\u201cI sincerely believe the jury\u2019s decision to award this verdict was a wake-up call to the department and its leadership that they have to be mindful of what is said and how it\u2019s said and to be mindful of their conduct when engaging with their subordinates, their peers and the public for that matter,\u201d he said.\n\nThe five-member St. Louis County Board of Police Commissioners is a civilian oversight board that has the power to dismiss the police chief. It can also make recommendations on officer discipline, according to its website.\n\nSt. Louis County Executive Sam Page announced on Sunday that he will be naming new members to the St. Louis County Police Board this week.\n\n\u201cOur police department must be a place where every community member and every officer is respected and treated with dignity. Employment decisions in the department must be made on merit and who is best for the job,\u201d Page said.\n\nHe also defended Belmar, saying the police chief has \u201cserved the county faithfully for years.\u201d\n\nWildhaber\u2019s attorneys have meanwhile called Friday\u2019s verdict \u201chistoric.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis bravery and courage in standing up for what is right should be an inspiration for employees everywhere,\u201d they said in a statement obtained by HuffPost. \u201cWe sincerely hope that this matter is concluded so that our client can have the closure he deserves.\u201d\n\nHis attorneys declined to comment further on the verdict. A representative with the St. Louis County Police Department also declined to comment.\n\nCriticism and calls for Belmar to resign have dogged the police department for years over its handling of the 2014 shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown.\n\nLucas Jackson / Reuters St Louis County police officers interact with anti-police demonstrators during protests in Ferguson, Missouri in August 2015.\n\nThe Justice Department back in 2015 reported that the police force\u2019s \u201cmilitarized\u201d response to protests over Brown\u2019s death was \u201cinappropriate\u201d and overly aggressive.\n\nThe police force, which responded to the protesters with snipers, tear gas and armored vehicles, was cited as having lacked \u201cthe training, leadership and culture necessary to truly engender community policing, and to build and sustain trusting relationships with the community.\u201d\n\nMissouri State Senator Maria Chappelle Nadal, who was among those protesting over Brown\u2019s death, expressed disappointment on Monday that it took a $20 million settlement to make it \u201cokay to ask for Belmar\u2019s resignation.\u201d\n\n5 years after rubber and wooden bullets and 20-year old tear gas canisters were shot in Ferguson, it's now okay to ask for Belmar's resignation. The harm was already done to so many St. Louis County residents. It took a $20 million settlement. #SoStLouishttps://t.co/9YUgC3BHp2 \u2014 MariaChappelleNadal\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf7 (@MariaChappelleN) October 28, 2019", "description": "St. Louis County\u2019s police chief is now facing calls to resign after the jury's award to Sgt.
