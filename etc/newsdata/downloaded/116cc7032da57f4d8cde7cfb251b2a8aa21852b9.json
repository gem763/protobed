Jim Treacher\u2019s kidding about that, but he\u2019s not joking about the surprising rebuke offered by the former president to the idea of \u201cwokeness\u201d and to call-out culture, especially on college campuses. Obama accused the woke brigades of confusing hyper-judgmentalism with actual change, and call-out culture for being lazy.\n\nTo put it another way, this is not hope and change:\n\n\u201cThis idea of purity, and you\u2019re never compromised, and you\u2019re always politically woke and all that stuff. You should get over that quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws.\u201d Obama also called out what he perceived as a \u201cdanger\u201d among younger people. \u201cThere is this sense sometimes of \u2018the way of me making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people, and that\u2019s enough,\u2019\u201d he said, then offered an example: Like if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right or used the wrong verb. Then, I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself because, \u2018Man, you see how woke I was? I called you out.\u2019 I\u2019m gonna get on TV. Watch my show. Watch \u2018Grown-ish.\u2019 You know, that\u2019s not activism. That\u2019s not bringing about change. If all you\u2019re doing is casting stones, you\u2019re probably not going to get that far.\n\nThat\u2019s about as succinct a take-down as one might find of progressive cancel culture, and it\u2019s coming from one of its icons. That\u2019s almost literally true, thanks to Shepard Fairey and his \u201cHOPE\u201d iconography, which he had later cause to regret. Having the Left\u2019s Mr. Cool tell you that your woke posing and Robespierre-esque tactics are nothing but narcissism should put a damper on things. If this doesn\u2019t do it, nothing will.\n\nThis might be the best post-presidency speech Obama has given yet, but Treacher\u2019s not terribly impressed by it. After all, he argues, Obama may scorn the Woke Brigades and narcissistic Robespierres now, but Treacher writes that Obama built that:\n\nMan, this guy must\u2019ve hated the president we had before Trump. That guy was always talking about \u201cgetting in their faces\u201d and \u201cpunching back twice as hard.\u201d He thought anybody who disagreed with him was just \u201cclinging to their guns and religion.\u201d He was judgmental as hell about a plumber who asked him a question he wasn\u2019t prepared to answer without embarrassing himself. Past Obama was not at all the sort of person Present Obama is describing here. But hey, it\u2019s still good advice for young people. If you wait long enough, eventually Obama will say something true by accident.\n\nAnd maybe learn a hard lesson eventually, too:\n\nIs it just me, or does he really sound like a right-winger there? The 2016 election was, in part, a backlash against the exact sort of behavior Obama is criticizing. People are tired of being judged, getting called out for using the wrong verb and so forth, and they voted accordingly.\n\nNo, Obama doesn\u2019t sound like a right-winger, but the problem with rampant Robespierrism is that eventually everyone ends up looking like a reactionary in comparison, including the Robespierres \u2026 as the original Maxmilien Robespierre found out a wee bit too late. Obama\u2019s smart enough to understand the history of cancel culture, from its tragic first appearance to the farcical (so far) version of it we face today. The 2016 election was in part the counterreaction to cancel culture, and Obama wants to eliminate it to belatedly consolidate the gains he made in eight years.\n\nRegardless of the motive and of the hypocrisy, Obama\u2019s both correct and devastating in this clip. Let\u2019s hope it gets lots and lots of play among the Hopenchange crowd.", "description": "\"If all you're doing is casting stones ...\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/o-woke-broke.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
