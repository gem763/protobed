Well, if winning is getting everything he wants, or even the bulk of it, then no. Johnson has already conceded a lot of ground to keep the negotiations alive at all\u2014that much is already clear. And whatever happens, if there is to be a deal between the EU and the U.K. before the October 31 deadline by which Britain must leave the bloc, Brussels will have largely stuck to the red lines it drew before the negotiations even began. Indeed, even if an agreement is struck on Britain\u2019s exit at an upcoming meeting of EU leaders this week, a backstop of some sort will be included (whether in name or in substance).\n\nOr if winning is forcing the U.K. Parliament to blink in a way his predecessor never managed to, then, again, no, he is not winning. Lawmakers have so far refused to let Johnson have his own way at all. They have actually done the opposite, passing a law forcing him to request an extension to Britain\u2019s membership of the EU should no deal emerge at the summit in Brussels.\n\nRead: The never-ending Brexit crisis\n\nMight he be winning politically, though? This is a different question entirely.\n\nPolitically, winning is not about the score sheet of diplomatic concessions. Nor is it concerned with whether Brexit is sensible, stupid, visionary, or disastrous.\n\nPolitically, winning is short-term and transactional: It involves setting the question you want voters to answer\u2014and getting them to respond in the way you want, all in the service of winning elections. If successful, you gain the power necessary to achieve the things you want to do and to stop the things you do not. This is the game as played by political strategists across the world, including those most central to Johnson\u2019s electoral successes to date: Lynton Crosby and Dominic Cummings. With Brexit, it is no different. It\u2019s just that the stakes on the table are much higher.\n\nCrosby, the Australian strategist who helped mastermind David Cameron\u2019s election success in 2015 as well as Johnson\u2019s two poll victories in the London mayoralty, is rigid in his advice, urging candidates to frame the choice facing voters in the way most advantageous to them\u2014and to stick to that position.\n\nIn 2017, he counseled May to frame the election as a Brexit choice, between strength and weakness, leadership and chaos. May muddied the waters, asking voters to give her a mandate to deliver a Brexit while refusing to provide any details about what that meant (while also offering a sweep of radical domestic reforms). Into the confused mix stepped the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who happily turned the election into a referendum on austerity.", "description": "At least politically, if not diplomatically, the British prime minister appears to be making some progress.", "authors": ["Tom Mctague"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX75PSG/facebook.jpg?1571067583", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
