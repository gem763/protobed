I\u2019ve stopped performing because of my Parkinson\u2019s disease and I\u2019ve stopped touring. I may perform at some other point but I have no plans to,\u2019 he told Chris Evans on the Virgin Radio Breakfast show.\n\n\u2018And I\u2019m quite happy taking my medicine and getting along with it. I\u2019ve started to drool which is a new one on me.\n\n\u2018This disease it gives you a new thing every now and again that you have to deal with and drooling is my latest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I walk unsteadily and my hearing is going and it\u2019s bizarre that bits of me are falling off but it\u2019s interesting.\u2019\n\nBilly may not be touring any more but he is still making documentaries (Picture: ITV)\n\nAlthough he would never rule out coming back to the stage, Billy admitted that his performance would be quite different to what fans are used to.\n\nHe explained: \u2018It would affect my performance. I don\u2019t think the way I used to, I don\u2019t think at the same speed as I used to. And because I don\u2019t need to.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t really know if the performance bit has gone because I have to get into the performance mode to see that. I\u2019d have to walk onto the stage and I\u2019ve never done that.\n\n\u2018And steadily more symptoms come and it\u2019s incurable. It\u2019s not going to end. As a matter of fact I had a Russian doctor in New York who said you realize this is an incurable disease.\n\n\u2018And I said you got to get a grip of yourself, stop calling it an incurable disease say we have yet to find the cure. Give the guy a light in the tunnel. Incurable is such an awful thing to say to somebody.\u2019\n\nWhile there may be no cure for Parkinson\u2019s, Billy says he doesn\u2019t fear the future as his life is good, and that his wife looks after him at home, making him breakfast and plumping his pillows at night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBilly first revealed he was being treated for the first signs of Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2013 while undergoing minor surgery for early-stage prostate cancer, and had acknowledged he had started to forget his lines on stage.\n\nIn January 2019 he admitted that the progression of the condition may force him to retire from performing altogether.\n\nWhile he has stopped touring, he has continued to make documentary TV series including Billy Connolly\u2019s Great American Trail, following the migration of Scots through America.\n\nThe Chris Evans Virgin Radio Breakfast Show with Sky is on weekdays from 6:30am and 10am.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
