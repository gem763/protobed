Hahn plays her as commandingly passive, shrinking into situations even when she\u2019s seeking them out. In the novel, she\u2019s jolted into sexual awakening by a filthy text message she gets from an unknown number calling her a \u201cmilf.\u201d In the series, Eve Googles the term after her friend jokingly calls her the same name, which leads her to the internet\u2019s iceberg tip of online smut. In the book, Perrotta employs at least 100 pages of interior monologue to help Eve explain why she\u2019s so fascinated by what she finds at sites such as the \u201cmilfateria.\u201d In the series, he has to rely on Hahn\u2019s impassive expression as she blinks at her screen, her face illuminated by the light of her laptop. What remains clear is how porn starts to infiltrate Eve\u2019s imagination, sexualizing the mundane experiences she has in the grocery store or at work.\n\nHBO\u2019s Mrs. Fletcher allows Eve a few fantasy sequences, in which her real life and her online adventures collide. \u201cWhy\u2019d you wait so long?\u201d a \u201cdirector\u201d asks her in one interlude, when she\u2019s imagining starring in a threesome scene. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was allowed,\u201d Eve replies. In these flashes of insight, the show can make sense: It isn\u2019t porn that\u2019s fascinating Eve so much as the idea that, in her mid-40s, she can reject every assumption she or anyone else has ever had about herself and start over. For Eve, porn is freedom.\n\nBut without the benefit of interior monologues, the show can waft abstractly into incoherence. The novel is a bleak thesis on the way we live now: too busy tapping our phones to forge meaningful connections or even just finish Middlemarch. (\u201cEverybody always says how great it is,\u201d Eve says, defensively. \u201cBut it never seems like the right time to crack it open.\u201d) In the book, when Eve signs up for a class at the local community college after Brendan leaves, she ends up in a course titled \u201cGender and Society,\u201d which allows Perrotta to sketch out some ideas about identity, sexuality, and \u201cpost-feminist\u201d discourse. In the series, Eve takes a personal-essay class instead, where she establishes a dubious flirtation with a 19-year-old who went to high school with her son. But she never writes a word.\n\nThe last television show that Perrotta worked on, HBO\u2019s The Leftovers, was a gorgeous bundle of structural mysteries and emotional precision. The writers of the series could sidestep answering specific questions viewers might have had, because so much of it was about how differently individual souls respond to things. Mrs. Fletcher, though, is missing an opportunity to say something profound about people and the inconvenient discrepancies between what they want and what they need. The series benefits from two remarkably deft performers, who paint outside the lines of their characters. (All seven episodes are directed by women, including the veteran Nicole Holofcener and the performer and writer Carrie Brownstein.) But in the end, I wanted more\u2014more insight, more illumination, more interrogation of the differences between sexual freedom and freedom itself.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
