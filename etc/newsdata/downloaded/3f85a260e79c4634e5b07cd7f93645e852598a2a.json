While bank earnings (and dividends) have been under pressure, bank multiples have actually held steady or risen. Price-to-earnings multiples on any other measure (earnings per share or pre-provision operating earnings to smooth out bad and doubtful debt cycles) are well above historical averages.\n\nIt appears that while underperforming the index, bank valuations have nonetheless been dragged up materially by a surging market overall, given their size.\n\nSo, to answer the question on whether banks are cheap enough to buy now, you need a strong view on where bond yields go from here and how the rest of the market performs, because it is hard to see too many positives from an earnings point of view.\n\nWe are hardly about to enter an earnings upgrade cycle for banks. Even holding earnings here versus a falling market may be enough. However, it is increasingly becoming a relative call rather than a fundamental one.\n\nThe key issue for banks is that their earnings remain under pressure on both revenues and costs. Very low and falling interest rates are making life very tough, with much of that yet to play out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, low interest rates mean people pay down their loans faster, further pressuring net volumes. Should supply and demand improve further and prove sustainable (rather than just a short-term bounce off low levels), that could be a positive change for the banks relative to recent history.\n\nIf low volumes weren\u2019t tough enough, the banks are having to contend with heavy competitive pressures on their margins.\n\nIn trying to compete for a slower growing pool of net new mortgages, the banks are pricing very keenly to attract the marginal dollar. What\u2019s more, with a large gap between front book pricing and back book pricing (new lenders get a better deal than those that already hold a mortgage), the target for the second-tier lenders is enticing.\n\nBanks also invest capital balances in interest rate products which will be getting a lower return. There continues to be more chance of rates falling rather than rising, keeping the pressure on.\n\nEither the banks lower mortgage rates as cash rates fall, to stay on-side of the government and community, and suffer a margin squeeze as a result, or they hold ground and risk customer backlash and market share loss from the smaller players and non-banks (something that is already happening). Not an enviable position.\n\nWe would note that many banks are trying hard to respond with cost and efficiency programs to offset rising regulatory costs and falling revenue growth \u2013 however these programs themselves require upfront investments with benefits only further down the track.\n\nCredit quality is the final issue to consider. All the banks are currently reporting significantly lower losses than normal. At some point those losses will deteriorate. Even if only marginally, given very low earnings growth, some deterioration will be a decent headwind to growth.\n\nWe remain underweight the sector for now. Attractive relative valuations restrain us from becoming too negative, as you likely get occasional bouts of bank relative performance on valuation or defensive grounds.\n\nWe would prefer to buy when absolute valuations look more attractive, rather than just relying on relative ones, but at the very least we need the news flow and negative environment to change.\n\nAndrew Martin is a portfolio manager at Alphinity Investment Management.", "description": "The answer is not simple, but it requires an assessment on bonds and the equity market because it's hard to see how earnings improve.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8011%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_126/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d000537d19be553845bb7f7b15fd3968149d13e6", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
