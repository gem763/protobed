With Monday\u2019s gains, both stocks have more than doubled this year.\n\nA sense of \u201curgency\u201d is taking hold in Washington after federal appeals court judges overturned a ruling that backed the government\u2019s right to take all of the companies\u2019 profits and concluded that structure of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, which regulates the two mortgage giants, is unconstitutional, Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky said by email. That urgency was evident during Mnuchin\u2019s interview with Fox Business where he stated that \u201cnow is the time to recapitalize\u201d the GSEs, Boltansky said.\n\nInvestors and analysts will keep a close eye on testimony from Mnuchin and FHFA director Mark Calabria on housing finance reform at a Sept. 10 Senate Banking Committee hearing.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample of some of the latest commentary:\n\nCompass Point, Isaac Boltansky\n\n\u201cIf the ruling stands, then the election next November stands as a de facto deadline for administrative action and nothing catalyzes action in Washington quite like a deadline,\u201d Boltansky said. \u201cAs we see it, the near-term road map is becoming clearer with a letter agreement allowing some degree of capital retention as early as this month, a PSPA amendment in the fourth quarter or first quarter of 2020, and additional administrative steps in 2020.\u201d PSPA refers to \u201csenior preferred stock purchase agreements.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Compass Point raised Fannie and Freddie common shares to buy from neutral after the Fifth Circuit decision delivered shareholders a \u201csignificant victory that will almost certainly influence the forthcoming administrative reform effort,\u201d analyst Chris Gamaitoni wrote in a note.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence, Elliott Stein\n\n\u201cThough Mnuchin wouldn\u2019t comment on the court case, we think the Sept. 6 court ruling in the 5th Circuit undercuts the legality of the sweep of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac profits to Treasury, while boosting GSE shareholders\u2019 leverage in anticipated negotiations to end it and eliminate some or all of Treasury\u2019s senior preferred liquidation preference. The decision also makes it easier for a president to fire the FHFA and CFPB director without cause.\u201d\n\nKBW, Brian Gardner\n\nThe court decision was only a \u201cpartial victory for GSE shareholders,\u201d Gardner cautioned in a note. \u201cDespite being one of the shareholders\u2019 few wins in court, we urge investors not to overreact to the headlines.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because \u201cthe decision was a mixed bag and increases the chances that the litigation reaches the U.S. Supreme Court since there apparently will be a split among different federal appellate courts -- something the Supreme Court will want to resolve.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe case is still far from settled and we think the government could still prevail on the merits,\u201d he said.\n\nCowen, Jaret Seiberg\n\n\u201cTuesday\u2019s Senate Banking hearing is the critical next step in the push for Fannie and Freddie to exit conservatorship,\u201d Seiberg wrote. \u201cWe will watch the reaction of Democrats, especially if Elizabeth Warren attends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat becomes even more important as the Fifth Circuit decision on Friday gives a new president the right to replace the FHFA director. So a Democratic win in 2020 could impact recap and release.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecap and release\u201d refers to the process of bolstering Fannie and Freddie\u2019s ability to absorb losses and then returning them to private shareholder ownership.\n\n(Updates share trading in second paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Richard Richtmyer\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Freddie Mac surged to their highest levels since February 2017 as analysts weighed in with an optimistic assessment after a double blast of good news rekindled this year\u2019s rebound.Fannie and Freddie shares both rallied as much as 35%, reaching session highs in afternoon", "authors": ["Felice Maranz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uCqu.QUtmShUH7S186nJiA--~B/aD0xNDk5O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/2b890a9c828af750b04ffdeaaa9a9d5d", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
