Only one in 10 countries have even a 50% chance of meeting the World Health Organization target of no rise in child obesity from 2010 to 2025.\n\nThe chances of 156 of the 191 countries studied achieving the target are less than 10%, according to the World Obesity Federation, which has compiled the data in the first Childhood Obesity Atlas.\n\nChildren who are obese often become adults with obesity, and are likely to develop serious health problems that will shorten their lives, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\n\n\u201cThe continuing increase in childhood obesity will overwhelm the health services of many countries. The increase shows a critical failure of government to respect and protect our children\u2019s rights to good health,\u201d said Donna Ryan, president of the federation, and Johanna Ralston, its chief executive, in a call to action in the Atlas.\n\nSome countries have low levels of obesity but will not escape the global surge without drastic action. Other countries have moderate or high levels and are not doing enough to stem the tide.\n\nThere will be nearly 62 million obese children aged five to 19 in China by 2030, 27 million in India and 17 million in the US. Obesity is damaging the health prospects for rich and poor countries alike. The Democratic Republic of the Congo will have 2.4 million children with obesity, and Tanzania and Vietnam will have 2 million each.\n\nThe federation calculated a risk score of an obesity crisis in the coming decade for each of the 191 countries with full data. Highest scoring were some of the Pacific islands, such as the Cook Islands and Palau, with the maximum risk score of 11 points. Puerto Rico and Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, also scored 11 and just behind them was New Zealand with 10.5 points.\n\nBut all countries have serious problems to address. Ukraine has the highest proportion of overweight infants, at 26%. In the Cook Islands 40.7% of children aged five to 19 are obese. The US is in the top 20, with a quarter of its children and one in five of its adolescents obese.\n\nThe federation\u2019s score cards for each country, colour coded red, green and amber for risk levels, factor in government policies as well as obesity rates, maternal smoking, infant stunting \u2013 which often leads to abdominal obesity as children later gain weight but not height \u2013 and inactivity in boys and girls.\n\nIn the UK, the prediction is that 1.3 million children and adolescents will be obese by 2030, even though it is doing better than most, with policies to restrict marketing of junk food to children and to tackle inactivity and unhealthy diets. Its chances of meeting the WHO target of no rise from 2010 to 2025 are 37%, which is at the high end. In the US, the chances of meeting the target are 17%.\n\nMany countries are given zero chance of reaching the target. The likelihood of an obesity problem in the UK in the 2020s is 7.5 in 11 and 8.5 for the US \u2013 both of them are in the red zone.\n\nTim Lobstein, the federation\u2019s policy director and one of the authors of the report, said: \u201cWhat we are seeing is a rising tide that has not been addressed in the policy world sufficiently. We see statements from policymakers and some countries beginning to take it seriously. A bit like the climate crisis and global overheating, we see resistance to intervene in what are otherwise free markets in order to improve people\u2019s and the planet\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nGovernments were acting slowly or not at all, he said, and there was strong resistance to intervening against commercial interests.\n\nUp to one in five of the 250 million children will be suffering from severe obesity, with a BMI equivalent \u2013 measured differently in children \u2013 of 35 or more. They may need medical help, such as bariatric surgery, and are at risk even in childhood of type 2 diabetes, which used to be an entirely adult disease. They will also be at risk as adults from cancers and heart disease.\n\n\u201cIn many countries, the health services won\u2019t cope,\u201d said Lobstein. \u201cThere may be a certain fatigue in listening to these figures getting worse and worse, but doing nothing is going to cost an awful lot more than making serious interventions in the marketplace to reduce the global marketing of soft drinks and ultra-processed foods.\u201d\n\nMultinational companies worldwide are making cheap food in bulk that has pushed out more nutritious foods from the market place, he said.\n\nLouise Baur, consultant paediatrician and head of child and adolescent health at the University of Sydney, who is the federation\u2019s childhood obesity ambassador, said that no one thing was responsible for the rise of childhood obesity, which began in the mid 1980s and had yet to be checked.\n\n\u201cWhat we were seeing was the rise of more convenience foods, more motorised less active transport, fewer kids biking and walking, the rise of sedentary pursuits and the use of [computer] screens by children. The world is so different,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have seen neighbourhoods change. Urban environments have lost walkability and green spaces. The car rules.\u201d\n\nThe problem began in more affluent countries but has spread everywhere. \u201cIn China, Vietnam, S\u00e3o Paulo, we see cars and motorbikes everywhere and no cycling or walking,\u201d Baur, added. As the WHO described it, she said, obesity was \u201cone of the most blatantly visible and yet most neglected [of] public health problems\u201d.", "description": "Exclusive: experts say obesity rates soaring as governments fail to tackle junk food adverts", "authors": ["Sarah Boseley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d842f6e63ca80a283cf44a7126172e84b3d441d1/0_200_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=09d8bca25c3b716767c7ebfc245056bd"}
