Kamala Harris, who has won three statewide elections in the nation\u2019s biggest state.\n\nIt\u2019s a show of force from the first-time political candidate \u2014 one that casts doubt on the viability of the dozen-plus other Democrats who have yet to build that kind of support or momentum so far in this presidential race. Yang\u2019s $10 million haul is at least double the amount raised last quarter by 16 other presidential candidates, among them five U.S. senators who had years to build email lists and mingle with the donor class before running for president. (Most candidates have not disclosed their fundraising for this quarter.)\n\nAnd Yang\u2019s fundraising stood in especially large contrast to prominent Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s third-quarter fundraising announcement. Booker\u2019s campaign announced this week that he raised $6 million, following a theatrical, last-minute fundraising drive in September, when his campaign manager warned supporters that Booker might have to drop out unless donors sent in an extra $1.7 million right away.\n\nMeanwhile, Yang \u2014 who started the campaign completely unknown, without political aides and with an email list composed of his Gmail contacts, as he tweeted Wednesday \u2014 is one of a handful of presidential candidates who have improved their standing, either financially or in polls, since the beginning of the year. Only Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Harris have posted a better single fundraising quarter than Yang so far this year.\n\nPresidential campaign veterans called Yang\u2019s third-quarter fundraising haul a dividing line for the Democratic field \u2014 one that separates the candidates with the resources to run national campaigns from those who have to bunker down in an early state and hope to generate a surprise there.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re one of the other candidates, you look at your resources. You\u2019ve got to be looking to do something to make a big mark on the scene,\u201d said Ed Brookover, who managed Ben Carson\u2019s insurgent campaign for president in 2016 and later became a senior adviser to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cThat could be a surprise finish in an early primary.\u201d\n\nYang\u2019s fundraising guarantees him nothing when the voting starts, and he trails far behind the front-runners in every poll so far. But he has mobilized a large number of dedicated supporters, something many other candidates lack: the \u201cYang Gang,\u201d which is especially active online.\n\nThat includes a large number of small-dollar givers. The details in Yang\u2019s most recent fundraising report will not be released for two weeks, but in his most recent Federal Election Commission disclosure, Yang raised 69 percent of his funds from donors who contributed $200 or less.\n\nThe bottom line of Yang\u2019s $10 million cash haul, said Joe Trippi, who managed Howard Dean\u2019s trailblazing 2004 presidential campaign, is that \u201cyou now have the resources to do something.\u201d\n\nCandidates without those finances will need to make difficult choices in the fall, as they try to concentrate their resources in ways that could still help them make an impact on the 2020 race.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep waiting for next month\u2019s debate as your moment. That\u2019s the mistake the entire field\u2019s made. If they don\u2019t put the organizational stuff together and make their stand, there won\u2019t be a stand to make,\" Trippi said.\n\nDean raised major sums as the first candidate to tap into online grassroots fundraising and organizing. But those throngs of online supporters, of course, did not translate into votes. Dean headed into the Iowa Caucus an energetic front-runner but lost unexpectedly to John Kerry, and soon after his campaign had gone kaput.\n\nYang now averages 3 percent support in national polls, according to RealClearPolitics \u2014 good for sixth in the Democratic field. While Yang\u2019s financial support has gone up dramatically, the people supporting him in polls has slowly expanded beyond his core group to a broader anti-establishment electorate, said Patrick Murray, director of polling at Monmouth University.", "description": "Andrew Yang likes to joke about being a math guy, and right now, the numbers are on his side.
