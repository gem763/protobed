REUTERS/Chris Helgren\n\nWhile Tesla delivered a record 97,000 cars, it missed Wall Street estimates of 97,477 vehicles and - more importantly - fell short of 100,000 deliveries that CEO Elon Musk said the company had \u201ca shot\u201d at in an email leaked last week.\n\nTesla has set a target to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019, which means it must deliver almost 105,000 vehicles in its final quarter to meet the low end of its full-year forecast.\n\nWhile supporters view Tesla as a growth stock, analysts on average expect the company to report a 7% drop in revenue and a non-GAAP loss of $82 million for the September quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Full-year revenue is seen increasing 15%, far less than Tesla\u2019s revenue growth of over 80% in 2018.\n\n\u201cGiven the decelerating revenue growth in 2019 and ongoing gross margin pressure, we expect net losses to exceed the losses in 2018, placing more pressure on what we see as an already expensive valuation,\u201d Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill wrote in a client note on Thursday.\n\nThe Model 3 sedan was meant to propel Tesla to sustainable profitability, but that has yet to happen during the car\u2019s two years on the market. While production problems initially hampered sales, some investors now worry about soft demand for the vehicle, as well as waning sales of its higher-end vehicles that are more profitable for Tesla.\n\nMusk has pushed back his target of turning a profit a number of times, most recently targeting the fourth quarter of 2019, with the September quarter to be break-even.\n\nMany on Wall Street have grown skeptical of Musk\u2019s pronouncements, such as his prediction last April that self-driving Tesla taxis would be available in some U.S. markets next year.\n\nUnderscoring investors\u2019 doubts about Tesla\u2019s progress with autonomous-driving technology, a U.S. regulator said on Wednesday it was looking into parking lot crashes involving Tesla cars driving themselves to their owners using a recently launched Smart Summon feature.\n\nAfter slumping in early 2019, Tesla\u2019s stock has stabilized since June, but it remains down 31% year to date.\n\nTo turn profitable, Musk has put a lid on costs while investing in initiatives such as building a $2 billion factory in Shanghai, as well as planned future models, such as the Model Y SUV and a commercial truck.\n\nTesla aims to start production at its China factory this month, but it is unclear when it will meet year-end production targets due to uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe company has yet to prove it can produce its vehicles at scale profitability, and we question management\u2019s projections of what the steady state of demand is for the current product lineup and roadmap,\u201d Cowen analysts wrote in a note to clients.", "description": "Tesla's stock dropped 6% on Thursday after the electric car maker's quarterly deliveries underwhelmed investors already concerned about slowing revenue growth and ongoing losses.", "authors": ["Noel Randewich", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436807798&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921UV"}
