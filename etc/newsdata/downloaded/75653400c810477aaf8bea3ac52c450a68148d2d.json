Mbappe knew all the results of the second division in France.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Nicolas Pepe is like that.

Now he\u02bcs champion of Europe. It\u2019s amazing.\n\nCampos signed Fabinho when he was at Real Madrid and again at Monaco (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I went to Brazil to watch Fluminese because they had some good players, they played Paulinia, the first team of Fabinho.\n\n\u2018Paulinia lost three or four-nil.
