He suffered the injury during the 49ers\u2019 31-3 victory over the Cleveland Browns on Monday night.\n\nThe second-year offensive lineman played 65 of a possible 71 offensive snaps in the win over the Browns. He was replaced by Daniel Brunskill late in the fourth quarter.\n\nMcGlinchey\u2019s knee issue marks the second injury to the 49ers\u2019 offensive line this season. Pro Bowl left tackle Joe Staley sustained a fractured fibula last month and is expected to return midway through the season after a multi-week absence.\n\nRookie offensive tackle Justin Skule has filled in for Staley since his injury. He played 100 percent of the 49ers\u2019 offensive snaps over the last two weeks.\n\nThe 49ers also lost starting fullback Kyle Juszczyk for up to six weeks because of an MCL sprain. Despite the team\u2019s injury woes, San Francisco has cruised to a 4-0 record for the first time since 1990.", "description": "Oct. 9 (UPI) \u2014 The San Francisco 49ers will be without starting right tackle Mike McGlinchey due to a knee injury, the team announced Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
