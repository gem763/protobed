Shadow Resources Minister Joel Fitzgibbon will use a speech in Sydney on Wednesday night to call on his colleagues to endorse the Coalition's 2030 emissions reduction target. Mr Fitzgibbon will argue the party should aim to reduce carbon emissions by 28 per cent of 2005 levels within 11 years. Energy Minister Angus Taylor has seized on the call, saying Labor was \u201cnow clearly recognising the error of their ways.\u201d \u201cLabor went to the last election with a 45 percent emission reduction target which was going to slash jobs, slash wages, and slash the economy,\u201d Mr Taylor said.
