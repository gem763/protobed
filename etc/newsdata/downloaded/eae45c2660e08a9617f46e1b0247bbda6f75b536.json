REUTERS/Maxim Zmeyev\n\n(Reuters) - Russian Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin said the country is considering alternatives to the U.S. dollar for energy transactions and is exploring currency settlements in euros and roubles for energy exports to minimize U.S. exposure.\n\n\u201cWe have a very good currency, it\u2019s stable. Why not use it for global transactions?\u201d Oreshkin said in an interview with the Financial Times on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe want (oil and gas sales) in roubles at some point,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cThe question here is not to have any excessive costs from doing it that way, but if the broad ... financial infrastructure is created, if the initial costs are very low, then why not?\u201d\n\nOreshkin said that Russia will be able to sell its energy exports in local currency given the popularity of the country\u2019s domestic bonds among foreign investors, who own 29% of its rouble debt.\n\nRussia has attempted to reduce its exposure to the U.S. through a \u201cde-dollarisation\u201d policy to offset the impact of U.S. sanctions.\n\nRussian assets came under pressure after the first round of western sanctions were imposed in 2014 for annexing Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nSubsequently, Washington imposed further sanctions on allegations of interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections and the poisoning of a former spy in Britain, accusations denied by Russia.\n\nIn August, the U.S. banned its banks from buying sovereign Eurobonds directly from Russia. Russia\u2019s finance ministry said last month that the country will focus more on selling its debt to investors from Asia and Europe and may adjust the currencies of its bond issues.\n\nOreshkin told FT Russia was aiming to boost its bilateral trade with the European Union, but it is unlikely to readmit EU food exports unless the bloc eases Russia\u2019s access to its market.", "description": "Russian Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin said the country is considering alternatives to the U.S. dollar for energy transactions and is exploring currency settlements in euros and roubles for energy exports to minimize U.S. exposure.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440283891&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C05H", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
