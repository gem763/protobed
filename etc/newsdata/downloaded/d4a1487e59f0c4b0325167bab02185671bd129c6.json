A doctor who performed Park's autopsy revealed the cause of death to the public, sparking massive outcry and protests.\n\nRelated content Lotte World Tower opens in Seoul setting world records\n\nUltimately, this event was the turning point that led to the June Democratic Movement (June 10-29) in 1989, which eventually resulted in general suffrage for South Koreans.\n\nThe building, located in central Seoul near the Namyeong subway station, has recently taken on a new life.\n\nIt's owned and managed by the Korea Democracy Foundation , which states that the museum will serve as \"a site for learning to expand democracy and planting its roots, and a point of solidarity where many nations and peoples from around the globe can strive for democracy together.\"\n\nRelated content 50 beautiful places to visit in South Korea\n\nMuseum displays also focus on global democracy, with a particular focus on Asia.
