Hanger steak is quickly seared in a drizzle of oil, and once done, the bok choy is cooked in the residual fat left behind, leaving you with one less pan to wash. This flexible dish also works well with seared or grilled shrimp or chicken. Shredded cabbage or tender broccolini could also be swapped in for the bok choy. Soft herbs like basil or cilantro would also be nice. The only thing you need to round out this meal is wine, preferably chilled and pink.", "description": "Soba, which are buckwheat noodles common in Japanese cooking, work well for a weeknight meal: They take just a few minutes to cook and can be served warm or at room temperature (which means they make great leftovers) Hanger steak is quickly seared in a drizzle of oil, and once done, the bok choy is cooked in the residual fat left behind, leaving you with one less pan to wash This flexible dish also works well with seared or grilled shrimp or chicken", "authors": ["Colu Henry", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Sarah Digregorio", "Ali Slagle", "Kay Chun", "Claire Saffitz", "Melissa Clark", "Julia Moskin", "Sam Sifton"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/28/dining/aw-soba-noodle-and-steak-salad/aw-soba-noodle-and-steak-salad-articleLarge-v2.jpg"}
