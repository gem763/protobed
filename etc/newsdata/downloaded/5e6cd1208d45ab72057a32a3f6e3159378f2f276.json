(Lauren Foster-Macleod/Reuters)\n\nCanadian authorities are working with allies to contain the potential damage after a top intelligence official was charged with violations of the nation\u2019s rarely used secrets law.\n\nAs director general of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police National Intelligence Coordination Center, Cameron Ortis had access to high-level intelligence from the nation\u2019s international allies, officials said Monday. The center addresses such national security risks as financing terrorism and nuclear threats.\n\nOrtis, 47, was arrested last week and charged with offenses including obtaining information to give to a foreign entity or terrorist group, communicating or confirming \u201cspecial operational information\u201d and breach of trust.\n\nRCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki, in her first public comments on the case, said Monday that the \u201cunsettling\u201d allegations had \u201cshaken\u201d many in Canada\u2019s federal police agency.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the potential risk to agency operations of our partners in Canada and abroad, and we thank them for their continued collaboration,\u201d Lucki said in a statement. She said \u201cmitigation strategies are being put in place as required.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, asked about the case while campaigning Monday in Waterloo, Ontario, said \u201cthis is something that the responsible authorities are engaged with at the highest levels, including with our allies.\u201d\n\n[Trudeau launches Canada\u2019s election season dogged by scandal, Scheer]\n\nOfficials have disclosed few details about the case that could have wide-ranging implications for Canada and its allies. The country is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network with the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nWithout more details about what information Ortis is accused of trying to leak, who the recipients might have been or whether he was successful, the potential damage is difficult to assess. But Canada is a net consumer of intelligence \u2014 it receives more from its allies than it provides \u2014 and will probably come under pressure now to ensure that measures are put in place to prevent future breaches.\n\n\u201cThe Five Eyes and really the international community are fairly well versed in dealing with this kind of breach,\u201d said Jessica Davis, a former analyst with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Canada\u2019s national security agency. \u201cAt the same time, the RCMP and Canada need to reassure our allies that steps have been taken to ensure that this kind of thing does not happen again.\u201d\n\nLucki said Ortis joined the RCMP in 2007 and worked in operations research and national security criminal investigations. That gave him \u201caccess to information the Canadian intelligence community possessed\u201d and \u201cto intelligence coming from our allies both domestically and internationally.\u201d\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Ortis earned a doctorate in international relations at the University of British Columbia in 2006 and speaks Mandarin Chinese. His doctoral thesis was \u201cBowing to Quirinus: Compromised Nodes and Cyber Security in East Asia.\u201d\n\nThe charges stem from activities alleged to have occurred between 2015 and 2019.\n\n[Canadian public inquiry: If serial killer nurse hadn\u2019t confessed, she wouldn\u2019t have been caught]\n\nDavis said Ortis was \u201cvery well known\u201d within Canada\u2019s small intelligence and security community and would often act as a liaison between agencies. She said she was surprised to learn of the charges.\n\n\u201cHis access was relatively unparalleled within the RCMP,\u201d she said, and would have included special operations material. That includes \u201cthe most sensitive of secrets,\u201d she said, such as human sources, methods of collection and information safeguarding procedures.\n\nThe Security of Information Act, the law under which Ortis was charged, was established at the outset of World War II and updated after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It addresses espionage and the protection of government secrets.\n\nThe law was used to convict Sub-Lt. Jeffrey Paul Delisle, a navy officer who pleaded guilty in 2012 to selling secrets to the Russian military. Russia paid him $71,000 over nearly five years for secrets that he smuggled out on a memory stick he kept in his pocket. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was granted full parole this year.\n\nStephanie Carvin, a professor of international relations at Ottawa\u2019s Carleton University, said U.S. officials were displeased with Canada following the Delisle case. But they soon found themselves embroiled in a crisis of their own when Edward Snowden leaked details of National Security Agency and Five Eyes surveillance programs.\n\n\u201cThe potential here for damage is far worse than the Delisle case,\u201d Carvin said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, she said, national security officials are left with uncomfortable questions: \u201cShould we be better at this? Why was this person not caught? This person would have had to have gone through multiple security clearances, including when he was promoted, so how was this missed?\u201d\n\nOrtis is due to appear Friday in court in Ottawa. Prosecutor John MacFarlane said last week that the government will ask that his request for bail be denied.\n\nRead more:\n\nAn oil pipeline expansion is dividing Canada\u2019s indigenous peoples\n\nMonths before Canada\u2019s election, Justin Trudeau\u2019s colorful mother takes the stage to tell all\n\nAs price of insulin soars, Americans caravan to Canada for lifesaving medicine\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Cameron Ortis served as director general of the National Intelligence Coordination Center.", "authors": ["Amanda Coletta", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QlEfV71xJariZYJaJpefeRLF5Cw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IEILPZWYUEI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
