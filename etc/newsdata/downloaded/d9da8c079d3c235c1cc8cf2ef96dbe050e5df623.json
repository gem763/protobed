Appearing as the network\u2019s latest pro-Trump talking head last week, the former Wisconsin congressman (and Real World: Boston castmember) claimed that the hacking of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election was a false flag operation conducted by Ukrainians, not the Russians. The rest of the panel on State of the Union practically shouted him down: \u201cThis is a disputed, absurd conspiracy theory that you\u2019re talking about right now,\u201d conservative pundit Amanda Carpenter said.\n\n\n\nDuffy tried his luck again the next day, suggesting that all Donald Trump wanted was to find the \u201creal\u201d DNC hackers, i.e. anybody but the Russians. CNN host Alisyn Camerota cut him off. \u201cThat\u2019s a conspiracy theory,\u201d she said indignantly.\n\n\n\nCNN executives certainly knew what they were getting into when they hired Duffy. A five-term congressman and Tea Party darling, Duffy has a long, well-documented history of making inflammatory and dishonest comments. Appearing on the network in February of 2017, Duffy defended Trump\u2019s Muslim ban by saying Middle Eastern terrorists are a more significant threat than white domestic terrorists because the latter commit \u201cone-off\u201d attacks. In the same interview he cited the \u201cgood things\u201d that stemmed from Dylann Roof\u2019s massacre of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. He has also suggested that George Soros was rigging elections, that Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin has \u201cties to the Muslim Brotherhood,\u201d and that the Democratic Party\u2019s pro-choice policies intentionally targeted black communities and amounted to \u201cinfanticide.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnfortunately for CNN and any other organization that clinging to a both-sides model of journalism, Duffy is probably the best the network can get. Call it asymmetric punditry: As Republicans become more extreme, it\u2019s become near-impossible to find non-loony ones to fill airtime on cable news.\n\n", "description": "The former congressman's turn as a pundit is a measure of the bankruptcy of both-sides journalism in the Trump era.", "authors": ["Alex Shephard"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/3bd3be686b4ed52833e2ad5309b95364c726c5d0.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
