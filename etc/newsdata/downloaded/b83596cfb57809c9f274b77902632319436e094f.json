They just made me feel so comfortable in the process. I\u2019m so glad that I\u2019ve ended up here now.\n\n\u201cThe brownies were just Woolies\u2019 packet mix. They can be my specialty now.\u201d\n\nNewton, 18, admitted she had been \u201ca bit grumpy at times\u201d in recent weeks and joked that her family would be glad the draft is finally over.\n\nShe prefers to play in the midfield but at 175cm could prove a handy target with former Dogs goalkicker Katie Brennan now at Richmond.\n\nHer two best friends Nell Morris-Dalton and Isabella Grant were also selected by the Dogs with pick six and a father-daughter pick at 47 respectively.\n\nThe Northern Knights skipper and two-time Under 18 All-Australian has spent two years in the AFL Academy after shifting her focus to football.\n\nShe had juggled the two sports until she was forced out of football in her early teens due to being unable to play alongside the junior boys.\n\nBasketball had her focus, playing NBL1 for the Southern Sabres and Vic Metro, before making the ultimate decision to turn back to the Sherrin last year.\n\nNewton hasn\u2019t ruled out a return to the court \u2014 just not yet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gradually been coming over the years (the choice),\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a few instances \u2014 in the All-Australian game last year, I missed a basketball final for it. That was the first thing where it was like \u2018footy is my passion\u2019. But this year when I just made the focus footy \u2014 I still played basketball, and I enjoyed so much playing with the NBL1 team at Southern Sabres, but footy was definitely the priority.\u201d\n\nIt has paid off.\n\nBurke said Newton was \u201cone of the best handballers \u2014 male or female \u2014 that I\u2019ve seen play the game\u201d and \u201cthe way that she brings her teammates into the game is a special talent\u201d.\n\nNewton couldn\u2019t contain her excitement in the chaotic few hours that followed, but said returning to her studies would be a quick transition as VCE exams loom.\n\nMORE AFLW\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of used to always being on the go,\u201d she said, having already secured early entry to a Bachelor of Science at Latrobe University.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll celebrate for a little bit and then be hitting the books tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAFL WOMEN\u2019S DRAFT 2019\n\n1 Gabby Newton (Western Bulldogs)\n\n2 Lucy McEvoy (Carlton)\n\n3 Lily Postlethwaite (Brisbane)\n\n4 Maggie Gorham (GWS)\n\n5 Georgia Patrikios (St Kilda)\n\n6 Nell Morris-Dalton (Western Bulldogs)\n\n7 Sophie Molan (Richmond)\n\n8 Gemma Lagioia (Western Bulldogs)\n\n9 Elisabeth Georgostathis (Western Bulldogs)\n\n10 Ellie Gavalas (North Melbourne)", "description": "Gabby Newton thanks the home brand brownie mix.", "authors": ["Lauren Wood"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/eb7c27bc6e8abb3c3fb3f44d4820b0d6?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
