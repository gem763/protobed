On the same night, Japan also experienced an earthquake and a deadly tornado, adding to the already utter fear that much of what we own could be wiped away in seconds. In preparation for the typhoon, news warned of blackouts, water outage, and limited access to food or daily supplies. Indeed, supermarkets ran out of products before most of them closed as the typhoon approached.\n\nAt times like these, more than fearing for your own life, the fear of not being able to meet the needs of your baby in case your home runs out of electricity, gas, and hot water, becomes immeasurable. The only way we can lessen the damage caused by natural disasters is to be prepared. The following Japanese products can help any mom and her babies in case of an emergency, so if you\u2019re caring for a little one, stock up on a few of those at home and rest assured that you\u2019re well prepared for the next time nature shuts out our access to normal life.\n\n1. Icreo and Rakuraku ready-to-drink liquid baby formula\n\nGlico\u2019s Icreo Akachan Milk and Meiji\u2019s Hohoemi Rakuraku Milk are Japan\u2019s first ready-to-drink baby formulas. They were released on the market earlier this year (Glico\u2019s was first for the sake of accuracy) after the health ministry lifted the ban on liquid baby formula in August 2018. Glico\u2019s Icreo comes in a package of 125 ml, while Meiji\u2019s comes in a can of 240 ml. Both products can be stored at room temperature for six months (Glico) to a year (Meiji) and can be consumed whenever needed without the need for hot water. Apart from emergencies, these are also recommended for when traveling, leaving your baby in the care of other people, or for midnight feeding when your baby cries hysterically and you don\u2019t have the time to cool down the milk bottle.\n\nBuy at: Akachan Honpo, Nishimatsuya, other baby stores, drugstores, and online.\n\nPrice: Around \u00a5220 each. \u00a52,398 for a box of 12 Icreo on Amazon or \u00a55,095 for a box of 24 Hohoemi Rakuraku Milk on Amazon.\n\n2. Chu-bo\u2019s disposable baby bottles\n\nThis product is not entirely eco-friendly (although it doesn\u2019t contain BPA), but it\u2019s helpful when you don\u2019t have access to clean water or sanitizing tools to wash your regular feeding bottles. It comes in a package of four individually wrapped sanitized bottles that can fit up to 250 ml of milk. The teat has three hole sizes, fit for newborns to babies over seven months old, and is adjustable to the baby\u2019s sucking strength.\n\nBuy at: Akachan Honpo, Nishimatsuya, BabiesRUs, other baby stores, and online.\n\nPrice: Around \u00a51,300 for a pack of four.\n\n3. Water boiling kit\n\nFor moms who need to warm up baby food or make formula when there is no electricity or gas, DIY hot water kits are a lifesaver. All you need to do is pour water (so, make sure you have a stock-up of that) into the enclosed insulation bag and wait until it\u2019s ready in a few minutes. Shizuoka-born Try Company\u2019s kit can warm up to a liter of water, but it\u2019s faster if you warm up smaller quantities. It takes approximately 10 minutes to warm up 200 ml of water. Other similar kits include Morian Heatpack, which works on the same principle.\n\nBuy at: Buy online or at home supply stores such as Tokyu Hands.\n\nPrice: Around \u00a52,000. Morian Heatpack: Around \u00a51,000.\n\n4. Meiji Hohoemi RakuRaku Cube formula\n\nIf you have your water boiling kit at hand, this cube-shaped baby formula saves you from measuring formula spoons, and you can prepare the exact amount your baby needs. Each package contains four cubes, which altogether can make 160 ml of milk. If you need less or more, adjust the number of cubes you use. There are many formula products on the market, but most come in packages of 13 g, which can make 100 ml of milk \u2014 if your baby drinks less or more, it\u2019s harder to adjust, whereas this product allows you to make the exact amount your baby needs. Fit for newborns to up to one-year-olds.\n\nBuy at: Akachan Honpo, Nishimatsuya, BabiesRUs, other baby stores, and online.\n\nPrice: Around \u00a5460 for a box of five packages or \u00a51,600 for a box of 16.\n\n5. Pikimama baby sling\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Pikimama_official (@pikimama_official) on Sep 11, 2019 at 6:17pm PDT\n\nWe don\u2019t usually think of baby carriers as an emergency product, but they are, in fact, extremely practical if you need to hold your baby, make him feel comfortable and warm, and still move quickly while having freed both of your hands. Similar to Boba and Konny\u2019s baby carriers, Pikimama is a simple baby wrap founded by a Japan-based mom who could never find the perfect baby sling. Offered in a variety of colors and designs, Pikimama\u2019s wraps imitate a mother-to-child embrace but leaves you hands-free. Babies instantly fall asleep in this one, and it\u2019s effortless to wear. Made of two connected pieces of cloth and free of any buckles or attachments, the Pikimama wrap can also be used as an emergency blanket. Pikimama\u2019s wraps can be used from newborns to children up to 16 kg.\n\nBuy at: Pikimama online store\n\nPrice: \u00a56,500-\u00a58,000\n\n6. Furufuru baby bottle wash kit\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re in a situation where you don\u2019t have access to washing tools to clean your baby bottles (think an evacuation center, for example), this kit, containing a bottle and nipple brush, comes in handy. The special fiber threaded in the brush acts as a detergent, so all you have to do is put the brush into the bottle along with a bit of water, and shake for several seconds until clean. You get the same result as if you\u2019ve just washed the bottles with detergent. The brushes come in a small portable case, which can easily fit in any bag. This product also comes in handy when traveling.\n\nBuy at: Akachan Honpo, Nishimatsuya, Babies\u201cR\u201dUs, other baby stores, and online.\n\nPrice: Around \u00a5800\n\n7. Eightex\u2019s Carry Free portable baby chair harness\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by \u65e5\u672c\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \u516c\u5f0f\u30a2\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8 (@eightex_inc) on Jan 25, 2018 at 10:38pm PST\n\nSimply attach it to a chair or your body, and you can feed your child wherever you are. It is also practical if you need to sit your child for a second while you do something else. If you\u2019re forced to stay away from your home due to an emergency, take this harness with you as there may not be any chairs for your child there. Fit for babies who can sit without support (over five or six months, typically) until around three years old.\n\nBuy at: Akachan Honpo, Nishimatsuya, Babies\u201cR\u201dUs, other baby stores, and online.\n\nPrice: Around \u00a51,700\n\nAside from the products above, we would also recommend to stock up a bag of at least 20 diapers, water, a few pairs of clothes, and a blanket for your baby emergency kit. If you\u2019re forced to evacuate during a natural disaster, these are always products that are lacking at shelters. Meanwhile, let us all hope that there will never be the need to do that.\n\nWhat Japanese emergency baby products have been the most helpful to you?
