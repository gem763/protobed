The FDA said earlier this month it found unacceptable levels of NDMA in drugs containing ranitidine.\n\nBut FDA spokesman Jeremy Kahn said the regulator is now 'working to understand what happens to NDMA levels in the body, after ranitidine has been exposed to acid in the stomach.'\n\nZantac has been on the market for more than 35 years and was originally sold by Glaxo Holdings Ltd, now a part of GlaxoSmithKline PLC.\n\nAt one point it was the top-selling drug in the world.\n\nRepresentatives of GSK and Sanofi were not immediately available for comment.\n\nValisure's Chief Executive David Light said it was important that the FDA is investigating the issue because the company's data suggests the NDMA levels that can be formed in the body 'are many magnitudes of order higher than what's been talked about in the contamination.'\n\n'This is one of the main red flags we've raised the whole time - not just contamination but the fact that this is happening in the human body,' Light said.\n\nSanofi said last week it would recall the drug in the United States and Canada. Other drugmakers including GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis have recalled or halted distribution of their versions of the drug.\n\nRetailers including Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid have stopped selling ranitidine.\n\nThe FDA said on Wednesday that early tests of alternatives to Zantac such as Pepcid, Tagamet, Nexium, Prevacid and Prilosec have not been found to contain NDMA.\n\nNDMA had previously been found in some blood pressure medicines from a class of drugs known as angiotensin II receptor blockers.\n\nThose impurities are believed to have been introduced by recent changes in the manufacturing process.\n\nNDMA has been shown to cause colorectal, stomach, liver and kidney cancers in animal studies, and is suspected to raise risks of these diseases in humans, too.\n\nThe FDA did not issue a mandatory recall of Zantac or its generics, but rather warned the public of the finding.\n\nZantac's American seller, Sanofi, held off recalling its product for nearly a month after the FDA's September 13 warning.\n\nThe company called its volutary recall 'precautionary' and has said it's working closely with health officials to work out the levels of the contaminant in its products.\n\nIt says that producers of the active ingredient are conducting tests to be reported to both Sanofi and the FDA.\n\nScientists have noted that organ changes are apparent very soon after animals ingest highly concentrated NDMA.\n\nBut the chemical does breakdown in the environment, and it's not clear whether it persists in the human body or how it might accumulate over time in someone who took Zantac regularly for years, for example.\n\nThe FDA's ongoing investigation will aim to provide some clarity about these exposures and reactions and their potential risks.", "description": "The US Food and Drug Administration is doing further tests to see how NDMA, the carcinogen found in Zantac, acts inside the body after experts warned it could reach higher levels.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/14/19107402-0-image-a-6_1572271543741.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
