Getty Images 3/26 Reiss Nelson, Arsenal Nelson has been restricted to a bit-part role in the Premier League this year, and will be looking to prove he is deserving of being in the Arsenal team. Arsenal FC via Getty Images 4/26 Robinho, Istanbul Basaksehir Yes, Robinho is still playing football. Now 35, the Brazilian counts Gael Clichy, Arda Turan and Demba Ba among his teammates at Istanbul Basaksehir AFP/Getty Images 5/26 Marcus Thuram, Borussia Monchengladbach Son of the famous Lilian Thuram, Marcus joined Monchengladbach in the summer from Guingamp. Unlike his father who was a fantastic defender, Marcus prefers scoring goals to preventing them. Bongarts/Getty Images 6/26 Andre Silva, Eintracht Frankfurt Andre Silva has yet to find a real home since leaving Porto in 2017 after a promising loan spell with Sevilla petered out last season. He will be tasked with replacing some of Luka Jovic\u2019s goals in Frankfurt. Getty Images 7/26 Bruno Fernandes, Sporting Lisbon One of the best players in this year's competition, Bruno Fernandes will be keen to further impress Europe\u2019s biggest clubs after a move out of Portugal failed to materialise this summer.

AFP/Getty Images 11/26 Viktor Tsygankov, Dynamo Kiev The young winger is highly rated in Ukraine and has already earned 15 caps for his country. At 21, now is the time to prove he can star in European competition. AFP/Getty Images 12/26 Daniel Sturridge, Trabzonspor The ex-Liverpool man is looking to get his career back on track in Turkey, and the chance to play in Europe was surely a factor in his move to Turkey. Liverpool FC via Getty Images 13/26 Enric Gallego, Getafe In the space of three years, Gallego has gone from part-time footballer/bricklayer to playing in a continental competition. The 33-year-old striker is a real feel-good story. AFP/Getty Images 14/26 Odsonne Edouard, Celtic The promising Frenchman has been linked with a move away from Celtic, and the Europa League is a great opportunity to showcase his talents to a wider audience. Getty Images 15/26 William Saliba, St Etienne Although he is currently injured, Arsenal fans will be keeping an eye on how their loan prospect does - especially given their own defensive frailties. Arsenal FC via Getty Images 16/26 Fyodor Chalov, CSKA Moscow Chalov is thought to be the future of the Russian national team, but at 21 is already a very capable goalscorer - he has 30 goals in 74 games for his club. Getty Images 17/26 Jerome Roussillon, Wolfsburg The wing-back has enjoyed a rise to prominence at Wolfsburg since joining from Montpellier last season, and is a standout player on their left flank. Bongarts/Getty Images 18/26 Wu Lei, Espanyol Wu Lei has over 60 caps for his China, and the winger became the first Chinese player to score in La Liga earlier this year for Espanyol. Getty Images 19/26 Asmir Begovic, Qarabag Begovic\u2019s stock plummeted last year at Bournemouth and the Bosnian is now looking for redemption in Azerbaijan. Getty Images 20/26 Eduardo Camavinga, Rennes The 16-year-old is one of Europe\u2019s hottest talents, and made headlines earlier this season for his standout performance in a 2-1 win over PSG back in August. AFP/Getty Images 21/26 Myron Boadu, AZ Alkmaar Boadu is just 18 but has netted three goals in five Eredivisie games for Alkmaar, and will be eager to put on a show when he travels to Old Trafford in a few weeks time. AFP/Getty Images 22/26 Morgan Gibbs-White, Wolves As Nuno Espirito Santo is yet to fully trust Gibbs-White with a significant role in the Premier League, the Englishman is another who will be keen to impress his manager. Getty Images 23/26 Moussa Marega, Porto Porto\u2019s main man is Moussa Marega, and the Malian boasts an impressive record of 33 goals in 67 Primeira Liga games. AFP/Getty Images 24/26 Nicolo Zaniolo, Roma The fleet-footed attacking midfielder is one of Italy\u2019s hottest prospects and arguably should be playing in the Champions League, given his talents. AFP/Getty Images 25/26 Lucas Ocampos, Sevilla The former Monaco prospect is just about getting his career back on track, and is part of Sevilla\u2019s rebuilding efforts for this season. AFP/Getty Images 26/26 Mason Greenwood, Manchester United The United prospect is set to be unleashed in the Europa League by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and will be determined to carry his youth team form into senior football.
