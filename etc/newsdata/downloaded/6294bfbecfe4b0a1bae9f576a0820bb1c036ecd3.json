Robust convention and room rate are likely to get reflected in the third-quarter results.\n\nThe company\u2019s Las Vegas operation is likely to have benefited from improving economic scenario and increased tourism numbers. Meanwhile, MGM Resorts has been consistently making important investments wherever it sees an opportunity.
