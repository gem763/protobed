She\u2019d chew the hell out of a sweet - broken bone or not! And crawl to get one with a broken leg!\"\n\nOthers went further to label the tip as 'dangerous'.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/Caiaimage)\n\n\"This post has to stop,\" wrote one. \"I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to work in A&E for most of my working life.\n\n\"Never, in my entire career if parent brought a child to me concerned about a facial fracture would I use a Haribo to make a diagnosis.\n\n\"Not at home, not in the playground, not with my own kids.\n\n\"If a child genuinely had a facial fracture, I would rather they didn\u2019t eat until they were assessed by a specialist. I would never, ever think you are wasting my time.\n\n\"Please let us support you being the parent, let us make the call and save the Haribos for after.\"", "description": "The nurse's advice has been widely shared online but another has urged parents to leave it to the professionals", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty Images Cultura Rf", "Men Media", "Getty Images Caiaimage"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543684.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Doctor-examining-young-girl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
