Production and sales of vehicles and home appliances have been plunging,\u201d said Richard Lu, an analyst with CRU in Beijing. He said steel firms had also underperformed due to rising raw material costs.\n\nLi said it was very difficult for the economy to grow at 6% or more and that it faced downward pressure.\n\nRetail sales missed expectations, with growth easing to 7.5%, from 7.6% in July. Car sales continued a year-long slide, dragging down the overall sales figures.\n\nCapital investment was another weak spot, dropping to 5.5% growth over the first eight months of the year from the same period in 2018, down from the 5.7% of the period between January and July.\n\nAnalysts Wei Yao and Michelle Lam at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said the lowering of the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by the central bank \u2013 the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) \u2013 allowed banks to lower their reserves, freeing up more funds for lending.\n\nBut the move is likely to be followed by more straightforward interest rate cuts. \u201cGiven the latest data, the rate cut last week now just seems a case of \u2018too little, too late\u2019,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cBefore the data came out we thought that one interest rate cut and one RRR cut in one month might be seen as too desperate. But now, we think that even a [small] rate cut tomorrow could look timid. A clear signal that the PBoC wants lower interest rates is all but necessary now,\u201d they added.\n\nSeveral analysts said in recent weeks that China\u2019s economic growth was already testing the lower end of Beijing\u2019s full-year target of about 6%-6.5%, which is likely to spur more policy easing. Second-quarter growth cooled to 6.2%, the weakest in nearly 30 years.\n\nLouis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said: \u201cThe key downside risk is the authorities not stepping up policy support sufficiently.\u201d\n\nThere is the prospect that Beijing will be forced to increase spending to supplement cuts in interest rates after figures showed that China\u2019s monthly crude steel output appeared to artificially boost overall production in August.\n\nSteel mills boosted output ahead of production cuts expected to kick in by October as part of Beijing\u2019s anti-pollution drive.\n\nTotal crude steel production was 87.25m tonnes last month, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, up 2.4% from 85.22m tonnes in July and up 9.3% from a year earlier.", "description": "Interest rate cuts may be necessary on top of central bank\u2019s recent move to ease lending restrictions", "authors": ["Phillip Inman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e5edb33c7d2778a1f93d297e7b0c40f9d70fc85/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5ebb924dfc59a4050e8d109625eb768b", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
