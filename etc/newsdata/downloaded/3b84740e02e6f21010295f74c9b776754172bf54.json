I think when an issue comes up, if you feel passionate about it or you feel like it's something you want to talk about, then so be it,' James said.\n\n'I also don't think that every issue should be everybody's problem as well.'\n\nLeBron James has spoken out again after sparking anger for suggesting Houston Rockets Daryl Morey 'wasn't educated' when he sent a tweet in support of protesters in Hong Kong earlier this month\n\nIn his comments on Monday, James said Morey was 'not really educated on the situation' when he sent out that since-deleted October 4 tweet showing support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests.\n\nMorey's tweet of support for the protests prompted Chinese sponsors and partners to cut ties with the league and forced the NBA to answer difficult questions about free speech.\n\nJames weighed in on the issue by telling reporters: 'We all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech. But at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others.\n\n'I don't want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl... But I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke.'\n\nIt unleashed an immediate backlash against James, who has often spoken out on social and political matters, with some expressing dismay that this time he seemed to be more concerned about protecting his own brand and financial interests in China, where he enjoys enormous popularity.\n\n'I've always been welcomed with open arms,' James said.\n\n'I've been to China probably 15 to 20 times... to have this beautiful game that we all love to be able to bring people together in the most positive way.'\n\nDemonstrators set a Lebron James jersey on fire during a rally in Hong Kong on Tuesday\n\nProtesters in Hong Kong on Tuesday trampled on James' jerseys, burning one, and threw basketballs at a photo of the four-time NBA MVP - a global sports icon whose image has taken a clear hit\n\nProtesters in Hong Kong on Tuesday trampled on James' jerseys, burning one, and threw basketballs at a photo of the four-time NBA MVP - a global sports icon whose image has taken a clear hit.\n\nAmong James' comments Monday night, his first publicly shared thoughts on the matter: 'So many people could have been harmed, not only financially but emotionally, physically and spiritually' by Morey's tweet.\n\nThat fanned the fallout fire, including from U.S. lawmakers who said they believed the NBA's primary goal had been to protect the league's massive financial interest when it comes to its relationship with China instead of more vigorously defending Morey's right to free speech.\n\nHouston Rockets' general manager, Daryl Morey, apologized for the now-deleted tweet in support of the Hong Kong protests\n\nSen. Rick Scott of Florida, a frequent critic of James, tweeted both Monday night and again Tuesday morning about the NBA star's comments, accusing him of 'kowtowing to Communist China.' The office of Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska also tweeted at James, saying 'you're parroting communist propaganda.'\n\nMorey has not apologized, and has not said anything publicly since two tweets on October 6 attempting to clarify his thinking.\n\nAt a media availability on Tuesday, several Rockets players and coach Mike D'Antoni declined to say much of anything about James' comments.\n\n'I haven't seen it,' Rockets star guard James Harden told reporters.\n\nRockets center Tyson Chandler, who was James' teammate on the Lakers last season, also passed on expressing an opinion.\n\n'I think again everybody's thoughts are their own,' Chandler told reporters. 'I think LeBron's (are) his, Daryl's (are) his and I like to stay out of people's thoughts.'\n\nTeammate forward Thabo Sefolosha, who was born in Switzerland and is in his first year with the Rockets, did touch briefly on the free-speech issue. 'Everybody is entitled to their opinion, entitled to what they want to say. That's the beauty about this country.'\n\nChina is considered the fastest-growing market for Nike, with whom James has a lifetime endorsement deal. In the most recent fiscal year, its revenue from China jumped 21% from the previous year, while overall, sales in China made up 16% of Nike's total revenue.\n\nHouston Rockets' general manager, Daryl Morey, apologized on Monday for the tweet he swiftly deleted over the weekend that included an image of the activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong'\n\nJames has often spoken out on issues he feels passionate about. When he played in Miami, he and other Heat players wore hoodies in reaction to the death of Trayvon Martin - an unarmed black teen who was wearing a hoodie when he was shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida in 2012.\n\nHe also has supported Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who began kneeling during the national anthem in an effort to raise awareness of racial oppression and police brutality.\n\nHe is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, campaigned for 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and most recently sat with California Gov. Gavin Newsom as the Democrat signed into law a bill that will allow college athletes in that state to hire agents and make money from endorsement deals.\n\nNewsom signed that bill while appearing on a special episode of HBO's 'The Shop: Uninterrupted' - part of James' off-court business empire. James is also the founder of a school for inner-city kids in his hometown of Akron, Ohio.\n\nJames said his reaction to Morey's tweet, which read 'Fight For Freedom: Stand With Hong Kong' before it was deleted within hours as the Chinese backlash grew, was not about its substance. Rather, he wrote, it was his belief that the Rockets' executive did not consider the ramifications - or the timing, while he and his teammates were in China.\n\n'My team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it,' he wrote on Twitter.", "description": "LeBron James has spoken out again after sparking anger for suggesting Houston Rockets\u00a0Daryl Morey 'wasn't educated' when he sent a tweet in support of protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/00/19764270-0-image-a-2_1571181739466.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
