REUTERS/Christopher Pike\n\nThe economy grew 1.7% in 2018, according to preliminary data released by the government.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s forecast is more cautious than the International Monetary Fund projection of 2.8% growth in 2019, supported by public spending as well as external factors.\n\nThe bank expects the oil sector to grow 5% in 2019, compared with 2.8% in 2018, while the non-oil sector will grow 1.4%, slightly faster than 2018.\n\nThe report also said the economy posted estimated growth of 2.2% in the second quarter compared to a year earlier, with non-oil real GDP up 1.5%.\n\n\u201cImproved outlook for growth is due to expected rising public and private spending at the Federal and Emirate\n\nlevels, higher investment ahead of the highly anticipated Expo 2020 and continued regional economic recovery, in light of the monetary policy easing in the U.S.,\u201d the central bank said.\n\nTotal government expenditure in the United Arab Emirates rose to 119 billion dirhams ($32.40 billion) in the first quarter of this year, the report said.\n\nThe oil sector is expected to grow, despite recent moves by oil producing nations to cut output, as the UAE benefits from Abu Dhabi National Oil Co\u2019s investment in value-added goods and services by more than 400 billion dirhams over five years, it said.\n\nEmployment in the private sector increased by 1.0% in the second-quarter of 2019 from a year earlier compared to an increase of 0.1% in the previous quarter, it said.", "description": "The United Arab Emirates expects its economy to grow 2.4% in 2019, driven by faster growth in the oil sector, the central bank said in a report on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432621864&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0DA", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
