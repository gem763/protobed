Many fear that a return to a visible 'hard' border could undermine a 1998 peace accord which mostly ended three decades of bloody, sectarian conflict that left some 3,600 people dead.\n\nWhen agreeing the deal, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that peace was what really mattered.\n\nThat is a sentiment shared by Derry native Richard Moore, who was blinded at the age of 10 when a British soldier fired a rubber bullet at him as he ran home from school, just a few months after Bloody Sunday.\n\n\"My children never really experienced the conflict the way I experienced it, they were born just around the time that peace was beginning to visit this part of the world,\" said Moore, who founded a charity to help children in impoverished countries.\n\nBut the three years of often acrimonious Brexit talks have been destabilising to the hard-won peace, he said.\n\n\"Now... young people are facing the same challenges and what you would be worried about is all the arguments presented over many years to support the peaceful approach and reject violence, all those arguments now will be lost and the people who want to support violence can attempt to justify their approach.\"\n\n\"If anything, I'm a living proof that violence is wrong. Let's not go back to that,\" he said.\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement settled the conflict between mainly Catholic Irish nationalists seeking union with Ireland and predominantly Protestant unionists wanting to remain part of the United Kingdom, creating a shared regional government and handing an economic lifeline to many. Former paramilitaries on both sides gave up their weapons, with some entering politics.\n\nIn 2013, the once-feared British army barracks became the headquarters of Derry-Londonderry's year as the UK City of Culture - a double-barrelled title reflecting the fact that many locals refer to their hometown simply as Derry.\n\nBut not everyone supported the peace deal and small hold-out militant groups still stage sporadic gun and bomb attacks. Recently, the city has witnessed an upsurge in violence, particularly among Irish nationalist youths in some of its poorest parts.\n\nThe high profile killing of 29-year-old journalist Lyra McKee in one of those areas in April during a riot sparked outrage.\n\nFew in the city predict a return to the kind of bloodshed of the past if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal and checks re-emerge in or around the border. However, those who lived through the decades of conflict do not want to put the fragile peace to the test.\n\n\"I think at times that it is blown out of perspective, that they (militant groups) are not as important as maybe they think they are,\" said Carita Kerr, who is in her 70s, at a cross-community women's book group for Catholics and Protestants.\n\nBut that is not to say that they could not do \"a lot of damage,\" she added.\n\n\"We came through it before and we don't want to go back to anything like that,\" she said.\n\n\"STILL DIVIDED\"\n\nThe Brexit deal reached between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the EU would keep Northern Ireland in the UK customs area, but tariffs would apply on goods crossing from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland if they are deemed to be headed into the bloc's single market.\n\nAmong those not happy with those terms are Johnson's Northern Irish allies in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), whose opposition complicates the task his minority government faces in ratifying the agreement.", "description": "Just a few kilometres from the border with Ireland, the people of Northern Ireland's second city of Londonderry know exactly what is at stake as Britain seeks to seal its departure from the European Union.
