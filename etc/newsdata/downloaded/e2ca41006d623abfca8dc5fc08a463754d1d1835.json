China accounts for just below half of the world\u2019s pork production and is also the top pork importing country. Basically, China consumes A LOT of pork. (For reference, the U.S. produces ~74 million pigs while China has 450-500 million; also, check out these \u201chigh-rise hog hotels\u201d in China).\n\nWe were noting back in April that ASF in China could erase between 20-40% of pigs in China, creating a huge deficit across the country, and additionally affecting the American market through the hog and corn markets.\n\nFast forward five months \u2013 and there\u2019s a bigger delay in the hog rally than we had expected, leading to a near full unwind of that Higdiculous move. Talk about buying the rumor and selling the news.\n\nSo what news are traders selling. Well, per National Hog Farmer (there really is a website for everything):\n\nProducers in China have been moving animals to market in panic type fashion for fear of experiencing an outbreak. This has contributed to overproduction and contributed to the placement of huge amounts of pork into frozen storage. Second, it appears that China was holding far more pork in frozen storage than anyone realized. They\u2019ve been pulling aggressively out of storage for a couple of months, again further delaying the acute production shortage that I expected to develop months ago\u2026.A major move upward in U.S. Hog prices will occur, likely at some point next year. (National Hog Farmer)\n\nThis is advanced supply/demand economics going on. There\u2019s likely to be a shortage of pork \u2013 but before we get there, there\u2019s likely to be an abundance of pork, because they are slaughtering pigs to eradicate the disease (and you can eat the pigs with the disease \u2013 no thanks, but they are in China). Throw the tariff equation (or lack thereof) on top of all this, with the possibility that American farmers won\u2019t even be able to sell their pork into China in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime shortage there, and you have one confused market.\n\nStay tuned.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Jeff Malec covering: .
