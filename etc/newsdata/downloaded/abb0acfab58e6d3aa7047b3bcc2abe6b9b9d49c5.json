It\u2019s Also Inevitable.", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: David Dow/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nLast Friday that Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted out an image that said \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d The NBA is still reeling from the ramifications.\n\nMorey\u2019s tweet, which has led to the Chinese government and the Chinese Basketball Association to cease cooperation with the Rockets and the league, has exposed a fault line in what had been (justifiably) considered professional sports\u2019 most progressive and forward-thinking league. Since the tweet, the NBA has called what Morey said \u201cregrettable\u201d and \u201coffensive,\u201d faced serious backlash from American legislators (if you ever wanted to know what would bring Beto O\u2019Rourke and Ted Cruz together, it\u2019s this), and then backtracked (sort of) in a statement early Tuesday morning, asserting its commitment to free speech, or something. But it has been undeniably jarring to see a major organization like the NBA kowtowing and pandering so shamelessly to the Chinese government. If you\u2019re wondering why NBA commissioner Adam Silver might feel like he has no choice, it doesn\u2019t entirely have to do with the league\u2019s business in China: It might have to do with China\u2019s business with its players.\n\nIf there has been one doctrine of the mostly successful so far Adam Silver era as commissioner of the NBA, it has not been raising revenue, social justice, or labor peace. It has been his insight \u2014 one still unshared by the commissioners of the other major North American professional sports \u2014 that the way you get owners and players to get along is to treat the players like owners. Every NBA player is a businessman by definition, but Silver\u2019s brilliance has been to treat them that way, like they are the power brokers they are all desperately eager to show they are. Silver has been able to treat the NBA\u2019s constant pursuit of every possible revenue stream as not only the norm, but in fact, in the players\u2019 absolute best interest. NBA players consider themselves entrepreneurs first and athletes second, and Silver has catered to that to his and the league\u2019s benefit at every turn, from his initial fateful decision to ban Donald Sterling from the league to his encouragement of his players\u2019 fights for social justice. Players feel Adam Silver is one of them because Silver has encouraged them to think of themselves almost as small-business affiliates within the larger NBA structure.\n\nIt is perhaps best to think of this specific strategy, then, when considering the backlash to the Morey tweet. Morey eventually deleted the tweet, saying, \u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China\u201d (which is very different than apologizing for what he said), but it was far too late for the Chinese, who, because of Yao Ming\u2019s longtime association with the Rockets, have been a supporter and broadcaster of the Rockets. Ming is the current president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which announced that it was immediately ending its association with the Rockets, and The People\u2019s Daily, the Chinese national newspaper, said, \u201c\u201dMorey\u2019s position is hurtful to Chinese basketball fans and is also an affront to the Chinese people\u201d and warned that corporations that have spoken up about Hong Kong have \u201cpaid a heavy price.\u201d That\u2019s probably why Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta immediately tweeted, \u201cMorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.\u201d But the NBA went even further, using the word \u201coffended.\u201d Considering China\u2019s history of human-rights abuses \u2014 not to mention the shooting of a 14-year-old boy during the Hong Kong protests this past weekend \u2014 the backlash to the NBA not standing behind Morey and against China has been swift.\n\nBut Silver knows what he\u2019s doing. He can side with China \u2014 which has increasingly become a vital business partner to the league, with an office in China, a Shanghai team in the NBA2K Gaming league, and of course, partnerships with countless apparel companies that have inextricable deals China \u2014 and not have to sweat a backlash from the one group of people who can cause him actual trouble: his players.\n\nI regret to inform you, America, but the senator from Florida is right here:\n\nAs #China strong arms the @NBA into silence still waiting for @Nike & their stable of \u201cwoke\u201d social justice warrior/athletes to speak out. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 7, 2019\n\nSure, Rubio is being inconsistent and weaselly and reliably Rubio-ish \u2014 hearing Marco Rubio argue that someone else should speak up about injustice in their own organization is quite a trip \u2014 but he is also \u2026 absolutely correct? NBA players have been trailblazers in recent years in their willingness, even their obligation, to speak up about social injustice, and, considering how much LeBron James himself has moved the needle on student athlete compensation (the California governor signed the Fair Pay for Play Bill on the set of LeBron\u2019s TV show), it\u2019s tough to argue they haven\u2019t made some legitimate breakthroughs. (Let us also never forget how LeBron called the President \u201cU Bum\u201d on Twitter \u2026 and it actually got Trump to shut up.) But getting them to speak up about China? James, Stephen Curry, and James Harden spent large chunks of their summer promoting their interests in China, and Dwyane Wade (one of the most activist athletes in all of sports) has a lifetime contract with Chinese sneaker company Li-Ning. As much as they have tied up with that nation in their personal brands and their shoe contracts? Yeah, mum\u2019s gonna be the word.\n\nActually, \u201cmum\u201d would be an improvement. Harden, who is only a Rocket because Morey traded for him, on Sunday stood with teammate Russell Westbrook (another Morey acquisition) and said, flat out, \u201cWe apologize. You know, we love China.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cno comment\u201d or \u201cI just want to stay out of it and play basketball.\u201d He said \u201cwe love China.\u201d Players know what side their bread is buttered on.\n\nPlayers might not be as shameless in their devotion to their Chinese interests as Harden or new Nets owner Joe Tsai, who just came out and said the hurt that Morey caused \u201cwill take a long time to repair\u201d after going on an odd mansplain-y detour about the Opium Wars. (Rich people!) But don\u2019t expect James to speak up on this one. It is one thing to speak out on injustice in our country; you can actually sell more Nike shoes that way. But going after China is just bad business. What NBA players have done by speaking out on social issues in the United States has made an important difference, and it will inspire future generations of players to do the same. But the bottom line is going to come first when it comes to China. Adam Silver has found another issue in which his interests and the interests of his players absolutely align. It won\u2019t do the people of Hong Kong any good. It might make him, and his players, look bad in the eyes of Beto O\u2019Rourke and Ted Cruz, but they don\u2019t buy, or make, enough shoes to matter.", "description": "Recently Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted out an image that said \u201cFight for Freedom.
