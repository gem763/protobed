Someone turned up to collect a chicken cake and they were here for 20 minutes and said they couldn\u2019t believe how realistic it looked.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really proud, it\u2019s brilliant to see peoples faces when they come and get it.\u2019\n\nIn fact, the mother-of-four\u2019s skills are so advance that her own children confuse the cakes for real takeaway meals.\n\nIt comes with all the sides (Picture: Caters)\n\nSelina\u2019s kids sometimes confuse the cakes for real meals (Picture: Caters)\n\nShe said: \u2018The kids often pick up chips and pieces of chicken thinking they\u2019re real.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re never very impressed when they turn out to be cake.\u2019\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling inspired to make your own fast food cakes, prepare to put in the work.\n\nThe minor details, such as chips and lettuce leafs, can take hours, while each cake takes days to finish.\n\nThe cakes takes days to make (Picture: Caters)\n\nThe cost of a takeaway creation varies depending on size, but ranges from \u00a3100 to \u00a3250 (Picture: Caters)\n\nSelina said: \u2018The batter for chicken or fish is made from rice krispies and marshmallows, which I\u2019ll then brush to add colour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I make the chips using shortbread and style them to make them look like they\u2019re fried.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re quite complex to make. Something like a burger is quite time-consuming as you have to make each lettuce leaf individually, as well as the burger buns.\u2019\n\nUnfortunately, the resemblance of the cakes doesn\u2019t stretch to the price.\n\nThe cost varies depending on the size of the treat, but ranges from \u00a3100 to \u00a3250.\n\nThen again, the look on your friends\u2019 faces as they bite into a cake chip will be priceless.\n\nMORE: Aldi\u2019s six-litre bottle of prosecco is back next week\n\nMORE: There\u2019s a bank that gives out ice cream with an ATM that dispenses free toppings\n\nMORE: Lidl launches wine tasting in the dark experiences across the UK\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Selina McCloud from Gosport, Hampshire has stunned the world with creations that resemble KFC and McDonald's meals.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_92182580_1571996567.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
