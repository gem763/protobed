Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry,\u201d the three chairmen wrote.\n\nThe three committees also want any information the State Department has about the involvement of Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Additionally, five senior State Department officials have been scheduled for depositions during the upcoming congressional recess.\n\n\u201cThe department has previously acknowledged that Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker played a direct role in arranging meetings between Rudy Giuliani, who has no official role in the U.S. government, and representatives of President Zelensky,\u201d the chairmen wrote to Pompeo on Friday.\n\nVolker resigned his post as the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine negotiations on Friday amid the increasing attention on his role in the controversy.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team agreed earlier this week to press ahead with an impeachment inquiry that\u2019s squarely focused on the Ukraine scandal engulfing Trump and some of his senior officials \u2014 allegations that have unified their fractious caucus against the president in a way that previous ones have not.\n\nThree members of the intelligence panel told POLITICO that they expect the committee to issue subpoenas for documents and witnesses as they work to corroborate the whistleblower\u2019s claims. Schiff later confirmed the action in his letter to colleagues.\n\nAtkinson, the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, previously said the complaint was both urgent and credible. The whistleblower, meanwhile, is awaiting legal guidance from the office of the director of national intelligence regarding what he or she is permitted to tell lawmakers. Democrats have accused Trump of abusing his power to pressure Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, and possibly withhold critical military aid to the Eastern European country.\n\nIn a separate letter to Democrats Friday afternoon, Pelosi reiterated that the impeachment investigation \u201cwill be centered\u201d in the Intelligence Committee, adding that Democrats will have \u201ca series of conference calls\u201d over the two-week recess to keep everyone updated.\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 campaign arm also sent lawmakers an internal poll conducted Thursday and Friday that showed likely voters more supportive of impeachment investigation than ever before. Fifty percent of likely voters said they would support \"impeaching Donald Trump and removing him from office\" and forty-nine percent of those surveyed said they were more likely to vote for a Democrat who backed an impeachment investigation versus thirty-eight percent who said they'd support a Republican opposed to the inquiry", "description": "Democrats are issuing new subpoenas and some lawmakers are planning to return to Washington despite a scheduled congressional recess.", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Heather Caygle", "Sarah Ferris"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7ZEd6L0lZ04rrRYxFSyGJw--~B/aD0zMjY0O3c9NDg5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/c2b5a8c0-e14c-11e9-97b6-9fe5eab6c9eb", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
