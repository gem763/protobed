Trump, who denies Daniels\u2019 claim of a sexual relationship, has claimed any payments were a personal matter, not a campaign expense.\n\nThe court cannot square a vision of presidential immunity that would place the president above the law Judge Victor Marrero\n\nThe federal investigation wound up in July. Vance, a Democrat, launched a fresh investigation into whether the Trump Organization falsely listed its reimbursement of Cohen for the $130,000 (then \u00a393,000) payment to Daniels as a legal expense. That would be illegal in New York.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers argue the president is immune from such an investigation while in office and the US constitution requires Vance to wait until after Trump has left the White House.\n\nOn Monday, the US district judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan described the immunity argument as \u201cextraordinary\u201d and as \u201can overreach of executive power [that was] repugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values\u201d.\n\nIn a 75-page decision, the judge added: \u201cThe court cannot square a vision of presidential immunity that would place the president above the law.\u201d\n\nDespite the impeachment inquiry and a fresh political crisis over Syria, Trump still found time to address the decision on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts, so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close!\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyers immediately appealed to the second US circuit court of appeals, which granted a temporary stay of the ruling \u201cpending expedited review\u201d.\n\nSeparately, Trump is trying to block Deutsche Bank from handing over financial records, which the bank has said include tax returns and which are sought by multiple House committees.\n\nThe criminal investigation in New York is unfolding with Trump already under siege from an impeachment inquiry touched off by his efforts to get Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate the former vice-president Joe Biden, a potential opponent at the polls next year.\n\nTrump has accused the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, of handing out subpoenas \u201clike cookies\u201d. There was no let up on Monday as Democrats subpoenaed the heads of the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget for documents related to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to freeze aid to Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats said in a statement: \u201cThe enclosed subpoena demands documents that are necessary for the committees to examine this sequence of these events and the reasons behind the White House\u2019s decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression.\u201d\n\nThe deadline to comply is 15 October.\n\nWill swing voters who went from Obama to Trump stay loyal in 2020?

Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, will give his deposition on Tuesday. Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled early, is due to appear on Friday.\n\nA lawyer representing the original intelligence community whistleblower whose complaint launched the impeachment inquiry said on Sunday that a second whistleblower had come forward and spoken to the intelligence community\u2019s internal watchdog, further complicating the president\u2019s case.", "description": "Judge rules Manhattan\u2019s district attorney could subpoena eight years of Trump\u2019s personal and corporate returnsUS politics \u2013 live updates", "authors": ["David Smith", "Kate Aronoff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/783dd530dc4844697de65043e749cf4c472db748/0_144_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22ef8b0413ccec72cf6922ec31cc5fee", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
