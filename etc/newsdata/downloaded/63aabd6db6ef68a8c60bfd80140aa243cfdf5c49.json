He's never threatened to murder him, ridiculous.'\n\nMrs Fagan married her husband in Jim Kerr's Sicily hotel in 2014, and said that Kerr had accused the couple of 'trying to ask me to harm my brother at a Stone Roses concert'.\n\nThe couple are superfans of Jim Kerr (left) and were married at his hotel in Italy. In an undated family photograph (right) Jim Kerr (second left) stands next to his younger brother Paul (also in a striped shirt)\n\n'I think he's gone and made a whole new post, just featuring around John, saying 'here's a Simple Minds superfan and he has asked me to harm my brother'.'\n\nDescribing what was said about her husband, she said: 'Pure and utter filth and lies.\n\n'He found out that John was a nurse and he said that he sodomised a boy. He used to vary it but the bottom line was that he raped a nine year old boy and that he was on the run from Liverpool police.'\n\nAnd of the abuse against her, she claimed he had called her a prostitute.\n\n'He took a photograph of my wedding, taken with obviously John and Jim Kerr, he did some sort of caption.'\n\nToday Lewes Crown Court (pictured above) heard that Mrs Fagan, felt 'mortified' and 'afraid' after Kerr allegedly threatened to rape her\n\nShe claims the caption read: 'Here she is, the Fagan that had 20 Sicilian men who rammed her on her wedding night and she still wasn't satisfied.'.\n\n'The worse ones was when he was describing having sex with me. It is just disgusting and totally not true.\n\n'I felt humiliated, I felt sick, absolutely sick.\n\n'I kept thinking why would you react like that to people you don't even know.\n\n'The only thing I can think of is, because of the bitter dispute between himself and his brother - there's a lot of bitterness and hatred.\n\n'I think he saw me and John as being superfans and I think he saw there were photos of us and his brother and I think the thought he could get back at his brother by abusing us.'\n\nAddressing another post from Kerry Mrs Fagan added: 'He's just called John a pig there.'\n\nShe also hinted that he had called them worst names than pig.\n\nShe said she married her husband at the Hotel Villa Angela in Taormina and had returned to Jim Kerr's hotel every year since then.\n\nMr Fagan, who has been to 356 Simple Minds concerts in 35 years, last week told jurors: 'He threatened to murder us, he threatened to cripple us, threatened us with a bat.'\n\nKerr denies stalking the pair, causing fear of violence at least twice between January and November last year.\n\nHe also denies stalking causing alarm or distress to his ex Elizabeth Vanthof between April and November that year, who he claims conspired with the couple to frame him with fake Facebook profiles.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Paul Kerr is also claimed to have posted 'pure filth' about married couple John and Julie Fagan during an 11-month hate campaign aimed at the pair from Kent.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/17/19999442-0-image-a-2_1571676294748.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
