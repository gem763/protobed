After all, David Attenborough, Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo have all delivered similar messages, decrying our ecological apocalypse, and yet they receive so little of the hatred Greta receives. Perhaps the problem isn\u2019t so much the message but the messenger.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Either they play the doe-eyed innocent, ready to be lured into wickedness (think Britney Spears in that schoolgirl outfit), or they\u2019re a brazen women from the off (Rihanna was a child star, remember). Either way, the sexualisation is inescapable.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Global Climate Strike \u2013 Independent's best photos Show all 50 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

She has said: \"There\u2019s people out there saying, \u2018Dress like a girl for once. Wear tight clothes you\u2019d be much prettier and your career would be so much better\u2019. No it wouldn\u2019t. It literally would not.\" Her wishes were ignored; a magazine recently put a mocked-up topless image of her on its cover.\n\nWhy does this happen? Because young women are only granted a public platform if they are sufficiently sexualised\n\nAs for young women in the public eye that Joe Public decides it doesn't want to sexualise? Those present without a grinning, pouting gloss? They're ridiculed as well \u2013 just like young Greta has been. Emma Gonzalez, the survivor of the Parkland school shooting, was called a \"skinhead lesbian\" \u2013 in an insulting way, mind \u2013 by pro-gun lobbyists after calling for gun control.\n\nThe same has happened to others working with Thunberg to reverse climate change. Isra Hersi, the co-founder of the US climate strike and the daughter of Minnesota senator Ilhan Omar, is sidelined because, as a young black Muslim, she's deemed to \"unattractive\" to take any notice of.\n\nAs I was told when I pointed out this duplicity on Twitter this week, Malala Yousafzai seems like an exception to this rule, because Western society accepted her childhood and did not attempt to sexualise her when she spoke out. Her cause \u2013 educating girls and women \u2013 was relatively uncontroversial in the West. But remember why she ended up as a public figurehead in the first place. The Taliban\u2019s soldiers were so angry that the then-14-year-old wanted girls of menstruating age (there's the sexualisation and objectification) to attend school, they literally shot her in the head. Assassination attempts are a pretty low bar to set for comparison and it doesn't mean we're doing much better. Young women who dare to speak against the status quo deserve a hell of a lot more than the sexism they get.\n\nClimate will rightly remain Thunberg's focal point, but the way she and other young women are treated simply for reaching their public platform should be another priority issue for the rest of us. Our girls aren\u2019t going to stop having interesting things to say or fighting vital campaigns.\n\nSo it's up to us \u2013 and, in particular, adult men who are old enough to know better \u2013 to stop measuring their worth based on outdated and sordid expectations designed to smother our young women.", "description": "For the millions who have joined her\u00a0strike for climate justice, Greta Thunberg is an inspirational 16-year-old who\u00a0is rightly furious about the global disaster her generation is due to inherit.
