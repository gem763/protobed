The Rays headed to Oakland for Wednesday\u2019s matchup against the A\u2019s (97-65), when Charlie Morton (16-6) will start. The winner of that game starts the Division Series at AL West champion Houston on Friday.\n\nMaking his third appearance returning from elbow surgery, Snell (6-8) allowed two runs and three hits in 2 1/3 innings. Snell threw 37 of 62 pitches for strikes, up from 26 pitches in his first outing and 52 in his second.\n\nToronto went 67-95, six wins fewer than last year and the Blue Jays\u2019 first 90-loss season since they went 67-94 in 2004.\n\nTeoscar Hern\u00e1ndez homered for the third straight game, extending his career-best total to 26, as the Blue Jays won for the ninth time in their final 13 games.\n\nBreyvic Valera also homered for Toronto, the first of his big league career. Starting in place of Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (right knee), Valera connected off Yonny Chirinos to begin the sixth.\n\nToronto drew 25,738 and finished with home attendance of 1,750,144, down from 2,325,281 last year and 3,203,886 fans in 2017. They dropped below 2 million for the first time since in 2011.\n\nIn likely his final game with Toronto, Justin Smoak went 2 for 4 with two doubles and three RBIs. Eligible for free agency, Smoak left to a standing ovation when he was replaced by pinch-runner Billy McKinney in the seventh.\n\nClay Buchholz (2-5) allowed one run and four hits in five innings to win for the first time since Aug. 31 against Houston.\n\nBack in the lineup after missing the previous two games because of a sore left foot, Rays first baseman Ji-Man Choi doubled in the first and hit his 19th homer in the fourth. Choi left Wednesday\u2019s win over the Yankees after fouling a pitch off his right foot. Jes\u00fas Aguilar replaced Choi in the fourth.\n\nNO QUIT IN KK\n\nTwo-time Gold Glove winner Kevin Kiermaier made an outstanding diving catch in center to retire Richard Ure\u00f1a in the second.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRays: INF Yandy D\u00edaz (left foot) was activated off the 60-day IL and RHP Cole Sulser was designated for assignment. D\u00edaz started as the designated hitter and led off, going 0 for 3 before being replaced by a pinch hitter. D\u00edaz lined out in both the first and third innings, hitting the ball at more than 100 miles per hour each time. \u2026 INF Eric Sogard, sidelined since Sept. 15 because of a sore right foot and ankle, said he\u2019s optimistic he\u2019ll be available Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Blake Snell lost in a tuneup for a potential postseason outing, and the Tampa Bay Rays were beaten by the Toronto Blue Jays 8-3 Sunday in their last game before the wild card playoff against the Oakland Athletics.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ian Harrison"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/rays_blue_jays_baseball_86753_c0-279-3000-2028_s1770x1032.jpg?a8a3b15ff7f78e8cad0327c88de7f10da07640ee", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
