In contrast, Peterson won 83% of her first service points.\n\nPeterson was also aided by Rybakina\u2019s double fault in the opening game of the first set that immediately swung the momentum in the Swede\u2019s favour.\n\nAlthough Rybakina tried to dictate rallies using her power, it was Peterson who finished off points, winning nine straight games to bagel the fourth seed in the second set and clinch the title.", "description": "Sweden's Rebecca Peterson brushed aside Elena Rybakina 6-2 6-0 to win her maiden WTA title at the Jiangxi Open in Nanchang on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
