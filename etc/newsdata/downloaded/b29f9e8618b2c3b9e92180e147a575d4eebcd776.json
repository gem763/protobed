It seems the connection between this majestic lake and its inhabitants is almost inextricable, and 78-year-old Lyubov Morekhodova is living proof.\n\nLyubov Morekhodova watches her cows through binoculars so they don\u2019t roam too far from home.\n\nBorn on Olkhon Island, she retired to live on the Baikal shoreline. Lyubov chops wood and carries buckets of water from an ice hole, keeps cows and regularly hits the ice in a pair of skates made by her father 76 years ago. The Siberian woman has become an internet sensation after a video of her gliding gracefully across the ice went viral. Since then journalists and reporters have been flocking to Baikal to see the ice-skating \u2018babushka\u2019.\n\nThe pensioner lives alone in the hamlet of Sarma on the shore of Lake Baikal.\n\nDespite living alone since her husband\u2019s death, she says she won\u2019t move anywhere. Even the strong winds, unrelenting cold and constant hard work, don\u2019t deter Lyubov Morekhodova, whose name translates as \u2018love walking on the sea\u2019.\n\n\u201cTell your journalist friends, to stop coming here!\u201d the hardy Granny laughs.\n\nBaikal Babushka. Songs of Life tells the story of this vigorous lady as the film crew follows her for a few days: the daily chores, meeting unceasing journalists and singing songs \u2013 set against an unforgiving landscape of Baikal in early spring.", "description": "Meet 78-year-old Lyubov Morekhodova, an ice skater living on Lake Baikal and a Siberian internet sensation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni-rt.secure2.footprint.net/rtd-files/films/baikal-babushka-siberia-ice-skating-granny/baikal-babushka-siberia-ice-skating-granny_2-mail0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-12"}
