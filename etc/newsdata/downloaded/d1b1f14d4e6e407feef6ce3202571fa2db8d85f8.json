In the distance was Stora (or Great) Fj\u00e4derholmarna, the largest of the four \u201cFeather Islands\u201d, east of the city. Small ships had been shuttling back and forth from its harbour all morning.\n\nThe scent grew more pronounced the closer we got \u2013 never overpowering, but on a still, late-summer\u2019s day, decidedly unusual. One fellow passenger, a Russian food writer with a cigar clamped between his teeth, was quick to quip. \u201cThat\u2019s burning beech wood: Niklas Ekstedt must be close.\u201d\n\nEkstedt is one of Scandinavia\u2019s most-lauded chefs, and we were heading towards Foodstock, a new festival he has organised to celebrate the Nordic culinary arts. Ekstedt is something of a household name in Sweden: a check-shirted, charismatic primitivist who turned away from his classical training (in the kitchens of Ferran Adri\u00e0 and Heston Blumenthal) to cook exclusively over open fires.\n\nEkstedt\u2019s eponymous Stockholm restaurant has no gas hobs or hi-tech ovens. He cooks only with coals, cast-iron pans and the occasional grill \u2013 and with an elegance that belies the rugged unpredictability of open-fire cooking.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ekstedt\u2019s eponymous Stockholm restaurant is gas- and electricity-free. Photograph: Leisa Tyler/Getty Images\n\n\u201cA lot of the food festivals I\u2019ve been to have felt like they were organised by music people who now think food is trendy,\u201d says Ekstedt, \u201cI wanted a proper one, led by chefs.\u201d And so he spent a year hand-selecting talents from all corners of Scandinavia and beyond to take up a two-day residency in the archipelago, with licence to express themselves and display their craft to guests.\n\nIn among the hungry hordes (and hordes they were: an estimated 10,000 people visited), the woods were filled with fire-pits, foragers and roaring foundries. Out towards to the island\u2019s craggy coast a young axe maker, Julia Kalthoff, was carving rods of oak into axe handles, silently, as the soft breeze blew the shavings into the water.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In for the chop \u2026 axe maker Julia Kalthoff\n\nThe island has long been a summer retreat for Stockholmers. Its quaint, lush environs hosted some of Europe\u2019s first \u201cbooze cruises\u201d \u2013 in the 1870s, when bootleggers would run free ships twice an hour to sell brandy to the mainland.\n\nIn modern times, Fj\u00e4derholmarna is a little bit more respectable: the closest island of the 30,000 in Stockholm\u2019s archipelago to the city, it is a foodie haven all year round, with chocolatiers, a fruit and veg market, a bakery, and its own destination restaurant, Fj\u00e4derholmarnas Krog.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A ferry approaching Fj\u00e4derholmarna island\n\nFoodstock spread to Fj\u00e4derholmarna\u2019s every corner: its waterfront cafes became aquavit bars, its craft shops hosted knife makers and old boathouses were commandeered as classrooms where luminaries such as David Zilber, Noma\u2019s fermentation whizz, gave lectures on how best to preserve blueberries.\n\nI wandered for two days straight, finding surprises tucked away among the trees and hills. One memorable discovery was the Saemien Beapmoe stall, where a pair of chefs from Lapland were cooking traditional S\u00e1mi dishes, just as they had been prepared for the past two millennia by the indigenous people of Scandinavia\u2019s great white north.\n\nSitting on the rocks, looking out to sun-stippled cliffs with water lapping at my feet, I had a two-course reindeer lunch. First a patty, fried in its own fat on S\u00e1mi flatbread; then a slice of reindeer blood sausage spiked with cloudberries, sour cream and a few shavings of cured reindeer ham. It was a once-in-a-lifetime meal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Saemien Beapmoe Lapland food stall\n\nIn banqueting halls and dining rooms, some of the world\u2019s best young chefs displayed their own take on Ekstedt\u2019s open-fire philosophy. Tomos Parry, head chef of London\u2019s critically acclaimed Brat restaurant, used hay and rows of hot coals to smoke two dozen ducks; the team behind Berlin\u2019s most sought-after restaurant, the 12-seater Ernst, gave the same treatment to fat langoustines and lean loins of roe deer.\n\nThroughout the festival, Ekstedt mingled with the crowds, chatting to anyone who cared to stop him and making impromptu speeches while standing on the nearest chair, praising the virtues of the food and craftspeople around him.\n\nIt was this magnetism that had brought a lot of revellers to Foodstock. One such couple, Johanna and Viktor Winblad, typified the clientele. Self-described Ekstedt fanatics, they had been eagerly awaiting Foodstock all summer. \u201cWhen Viktor found out about the festival, he said we should go,\u201d Johanna told me. \u201cI had to say no at first \u2013 because I\u2019d already bought our tickets for a surprise birthday present!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The wild interior of Fj\u00e4derholmarna\n\nJohanna and Viktor had come with their four month-old daughter, as had dozens of other young couples \u2013 strollers were accommodated and food adapted for younger palates.\n\nDespite the flames, smoke and hunter-gatherer aesthetic, Foodstock felt inclusive and unpretentious. \u201cThis is what a proper food culture looks like,\u201d said Brat chef, Tomos Parry. \u201cThere\u2019s no VIP section or celebrity egos here, just people in the sun enjoying good food.\u201d\n\nEkstedt agreed: \u201cScandinavians usually find the idea of a celebrity chef kind of strange. We see ourselves as very j\u00e4mlik [equal]. But because of the past few years, our profession is now taken seriously, and as a result we can set up on an island and invite people to eat our food like this.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Festivalgoers gather round a firepit at Foodstock\n\nEkstedt compares the modern food movement to his favourite hobby, skating: \u201cSkaters have a do-it-yourself culture, and things are made by skaters, for skaters. I want to do the same with food, so we do things our way, for one another, as people who love good food.\u201d\n\nFoodstock is one of a constellation of initiatives across the Nordic region to celebrate its progress from unexpected upstart in the food world to established gastro-destination.\n\nSince 2011, another influential event \u2013 chef Rene Redzepi\u2019s MAD Symposium, in Copenhagen \u2013 has been the Glastonbury of food festivals; it is, however, a lot more difficult, and costly, to visit. The application process is lengthy, and a two-day ticket costs around \u00a3420, whereas a two-day Foodstock ticket is around \u00a363, including return ferry travel from Stockholm.\n\nThe festival drew to a close on the Sunday afternoon, with guests and chefs crowded under canopies by the shore, drinking Fernet Branca and grilling whole pike perch over the coals. By this point, there was no semblance of separation between who was serving and who was being served; chunks of smoky white fish were being passed around while everyone chatted.\n\nSuddenly, after two days of unremitting sunshine, the heavens opened and torrential rain battered the island for all of five minutes, drenching anyone not under canvas. For the briefest of moments, it felt like we were a long way from the mainland and the rest of the world \u2013 all stuck on Fj\u00e4derholmarna, but not really minding if we never went home. Doesn\u2019t that sound like a proper festival?\n\n\u2022 The trip was provided by Foodstock. Fj\u00e4derholmarna island is a 30-minute ferry ride from Stockholm\u2019s Strandv\u00e4gen quay, returns about \u00a313\n\nLooking for a holiday with a difference?
