USA TODAY\n\nHours after a Monday night beating that propelled their record to 7-0, the New England Patriots made a move to give quarterback Tom Brady another weapon.\n\nThe Patriots and Atlanta Falcons agreed to a trade that will send receiver Mohamed Sanu to New England for a second-round draft pick, a person with knowledge of the deal told USA TODAY Sports' Mike Jones. The person requested anonymity because the deal hasn't been officially announced.\n\nSanu, 30, was in his fourth season with the Falcons. Through six games, he had 33 catches for 313 yards and a touchdown. Sanu spent the first four seasons of his career with the Cincinnati Bengals after being taken out of Rutgers in the third round of the 2012 draft.\n\nThe Falcons traded Sanu to the Patriots early Tuesday.

They traded Demaryius Thomas to the Jets early in the season and released Antonio Brown less than two weeks after signing him, all of which contributed to New England's deficiency at wideout.\n\nSanu joins an offensive attack that, led by Brady and a disciplined run game, ranks fifth in passing yards per contest (279.7) and first in total points per game (31.9).\n\nThe Falcons fell to 1-6 over the weekend and are in last place in the AFC South. With coach Dan Quinn on the hot seat, the team could continue selling as the Oct. 29 trade deadline approaches.", "description": "The New England Patriots acquired Mohamed Sanu from the Atlanta Falcons for a second-round draft pick.
