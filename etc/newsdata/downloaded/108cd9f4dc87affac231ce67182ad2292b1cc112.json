Rugby World Cup time, and a couple of the teams who have battled in previous editions, but want to make an impression this time around. Namibia have always been an amateur team \u2013 see the story of Rudie Van Vuuren, who played for the country in the Cricket World Cup and the Rugby World Cup back to back in 2003. They\u2019ve never won a match in either tournament, but they\u2019ve had a long training camp this time and are hopeful of competing.\n\nItaly may not be the nation that you first think of when you think of rugby, but there is a tradition of the game in some parts.
