supporters amid an impeachment inquiry and concerns Mr Trump used his office to create trouble for a political rival.\n\nThe 30-second commercial claims that Mr Biden promised Ukraine $1bn (\u00a3810m) to fire a prosecutor looking into \"his son's company.\"\n\nHunter Biden sat on the board of energy firm Burisma but does not own it and while Mr Biden was key in the Obama administration's efforts to remove Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin using US aid as leverage, no evidence indicates that Mr Biden sought to help his son. Widely criticised for his handling of corruption cases, Mr Shokin was eventually voted out of office.\n\nThe ad goes on to criticise another common Trump target, accusing \"media lap dogs\" of aiding Democrats' impeachment efforts. It depicts prominent journalists bashed by Mr Trump: CNN hosts Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo, White House correspondent Jim Acosta and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.\n\nCNN said in a statement that \"in addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.\"\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Last year, channels including Fox News \u2013 the president's favoured news network \u2013 nixed an ad that CNN and others called racist for its depiction of immigrants as \"dangerous illegal criminals.\"\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "CNN will not run two Donald Trump campaign ads because they make \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d claims while discussing impeachment, the television channel said on Thursday. The network\u00a0added that the adverts disparage its journalists and push unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against former vice president Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/04/08/trump-impeachment.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
