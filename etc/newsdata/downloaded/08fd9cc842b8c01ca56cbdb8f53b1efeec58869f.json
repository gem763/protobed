Decimated by relentless arrests, weighed down by the recent economic crisis, short on cash and on foot soldiers, Cosa Nostra has become a paper tiger.\n\nDead? No, because it\u2019s still embedded in Sicilian society; but transformed, yes: reduced, according to many, to the level of a neighbourhood gang.\n\n\u201cIt is very probable that today\u2019s mafia is the weakest in its history,\u201d says Salvatore Lupo, a professor of contemporary history at Palermo University and a renowned expert in the history of Italy\u2019s Cosa Nostra. \u201cThe Italian state has obtained unprecedented results. Judicial pressure and the crisis it has caused in recent years is something that mafia bosses have never experienced in the organisation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nSince Falcone and Borsellino\u2019s deaths, the police have arrested more than 4,000 mafiosi, including 361 in 2011 and 300 in 2014.
