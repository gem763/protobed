Plaintiff will effectively be forced to adjudicate the Constitutional dispute himself, and if he judges wrongly, he will inflict grave Constitutional injury on either the House or the President,\" Cooper wrote in a court filing.\n\nKupperman pointed to what he described as the merits and drawbacks of both the White House and Congress' arguments.\n\nHe noted that a court ruled in 2008 that there are limits on claims of \"absolute immunity\" of presidential advisers to congressional testimony, even if those limits hadn't been tested. That court determined that President George W. Bush's counsel, Harriet Miers and other senior administration officials, did not enjoy \"absolute immunity.\" But the court left the guidelines ambiguous.\n\n\"The district court in Miers further concluded that the Counsel to the President was not entitled to absolute or qualified immunity because the inquiry did not \u201cinvolve the sensitive topics of national security or foreign affairs,\" Cooper noted. \"National security and foreign affairs are at the heart of the information that the House Defendants seek from Plaintiff in connection with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nFormer National Security Adviser John Bolton. | Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nBut Kupperman also raised questions about whether the House subpoena itself was valid, in part because of concerns raised by Republicans that the impeachment inquiry itself failed to comply with House rules.\n\n\"It is unclear whether a House committee has the authority to issue subpoenas to investigate potentially illegal conduct by an impeachable officer outside the scope of a properly authorized impeachment inquiry,\" Cooper argues.\n\nIn a rebuke of that position, however, a federal judge in a separate matter ruled earlier in the day that the House's impeachment inquiry is valid and constitutional, rejecting the Trump administration's claim that it's an illegitimate exercise of congressional power.\n\nRepublicans have contended that the House must hold a formal vote to launch an impeachment inquiry, but in her ruling, Judge Beryl Howell \u2014 chief judge of the federal District Court in Washington D.C. \u2014 said there is no requirement of a formal vote. Rather, Howell ruled, Speaker Nancy Pelosi's determination that several House committees were pursuing potential impeachment justifies the probe.\n\nIt's unclear how Howell's ruling might affect the immediate handling of Kupperman's case.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9b/f9/20ab7a0840bf990c3cbed2468505/190730-dc-court-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
