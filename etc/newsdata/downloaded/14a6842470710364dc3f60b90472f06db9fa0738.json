The manager\u2019s attempts to boost the mood of a beleaguered football nation were undermined by harsh reality. Romelu Lukaku set the tone for a dominant Belgian performance \u2013 in which Kevin De Bruyne was at the heart of everything positive \u2013 as the Scots endured yet another harrowing night.\n\nScotland teams, while unable to compete on technical terms with the world\u2019s best over a concerted period now, are now also apparently easy to beat. Clarke must have his sights on next year\u2019s Nations League play-offs as his only legitimate means of reaching Euro 2020 but he has a significant task in raising morale in the meantime. After years in the doldrums apathy reigns. Whether Clarke is any closer to finding solutions after four matches in charge is open to debate. Scotland have slipped to fifth in Group I.\n\n\u201cThe group is over in terms of qualification,\u201d Clarke admitted. \u201cWhat we have to do now, and we spoke about it after the game, is target third position. It doesn\u2019t look very good where we are in the table just now. There are 12 points up for grabs between now and the end of this campaign and we need to make sure we finish third.\u201d\n\nBelgium remain a joy to watch. The ease with which they dismantled Scotland was such that the teams could have been engaged in separate sports. And this was Belgium \u2013 who now have six wins out of six \u2013 minus Eden Hazard. \u201cI was very pleased with my experienced players,\u201d said Belgium\u2019s manager, Roberto Mart\u00ednez. \u201cThis was a fantastic result. We can improve, we can get better. There is a lot of growth to go.\u201d\n\nClarke had been critical of his players after Friday\u2019s 2-1 defeat by Russia, meaning that changes in the home line-up were altogether logical. There was symmetry between this encounter and the one with Russia in the sense that Scotland opened promisingly. Whereas Scotland were a goal to the good against Russia three days earlier, a ruthless Belgian counter-attack left the hosts chasing a deficit inside 10 minutes here. Scotland\u2019s flurry was also only that; blink and you missed it.\n\nFrom an attacking Scotland free-kick, a headed clearance fell to Dries Mertens. Stephen O\u2019Donnell should have halted potential danger there, with Mertens instead afforded ample time to whip a pass up the line to the marauding De Bruyne. Lukaku, in yards of space, was played in by De Bruyne and slotted home beneath the advancing David Marshall. It was a goal of blissful simplicity, if one Scotland should have averted just outside their opposition\u2019s penalty area.\n\nIt may be harsh to blame generous defending for Belgium\u2019s second, such was the quality of De Bruyne\u2019s cross from the right touchline. Thomas Meunier had flicked the ball back into the Manchester City man\u2019s path before this act of genius, with Thomas Vermaelen on hand to score from all of three yards. Scotland\u2019s fans do not seem to get angry about the gulf between their team and the world\u2019s best any more; the air of resignation was as palpable as it was familiar.\n\nWorse was to follow for Clarke before the interval. Charlie Mulgrew made a hash of trying to head a De Bruyne corner away, a situation that played out perfectly for Toby Alderweireld. The defender\u2019s header bounced in, via the crossbar, with the assistant referee due credit for the perfect call in awarding the goal. Thirty two minutes in, it was a question of how many Belgium felt like scoring. Scotland were not even competitive.\n\nA terrific Marshall save prevented Mertens from adding Belgium\u2019s fourth within two minutes of the re-start. Embarrassment followed for O\u2019Donnell as he incurred a booking for a penalty area dive with only Vermaelen in close proximity. De Bruyne got the goal his showing fully deserved, a first-time, curled finish after collection of a Lukaku pass. \u201cTo keep a clean sheet pleases me more than anything,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez. This somehow implied it was ever in doubt.", "description": "Kevin De Bruyne runs the show at Hampden as Scotland find no answer to the slick forward play of Belgium, who won their European Championship qualifier 4-0", "authors": ["Ewan Murray"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3fa283430f56757a2bb1b165dff2afe3280cb5e/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c9e1e4d848118cbd1589d89e340a5f8", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
