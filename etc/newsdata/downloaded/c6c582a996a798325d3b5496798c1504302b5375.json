It\u2019s probably the biggest challenge of Muller\u2019s career.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHatchard added: \u201cI still think he is a very, very good footballer and any top Premier League team would benefit from having him in the building.\n\n\u201cThe fluid nature of it would appeal to Muller, without question because his movement is incredible.\n\n\"He\u2019s so elusive, he picks up positions a lot of players simply don\u2019t and I think he\u2019d be a huge boost to Liverpool.\n\n\u201cI think Premier League clubs will be on alert.\u201d\n\n(Image: PETER POWELL/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nHowever, Muller would arguably find it just as difficult to break into the Liverpool team, with Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane established as their fearsome forward line.\n\nHatchard said: \u201cThey\u2019ll be monitoring his progress but that block remains, how can you persuade him that he can be a regular first team player.\u201d\n\nKlopp was keen on signing Muller in 2017 but Bayern refused to listen to offers at the time, according to German publication Bild .", "description": "Thomas Muller could be set for Bayern Munich exit after being kept out of the team by former Reds man", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa", "Peter Powell Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543022.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-GER-BUNDESLIGA-BAYERN-MUNICH-HOFFENHEIM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
