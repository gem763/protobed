But with the arrival of the Labor Day holiday comes a time-honored transition to a new and more volatile stage of the race. The field is narrowing, the competition growing more sharp.\n\nRelated: How Warren surged past Sanders \u2013 and how he fought back\n\nFormer vice-president Joe Biden has held his early lead despite a season of missteps and gaffes. He is trailed by Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who has staked out healthcare as his defining issue. But both have lost ground to Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who spent her summer churning out policy plans, working selfie lines and steadily climbing the polls.\n\nRounding out the top tier are the California senator Kamala Harris and South Bend\u2019s mayor, Pete Buttigieg, who used televised events to break through a congested field but have seen their progress stall.\n\nParty leaders and strategists say the race remains fluid at the top as the contenders prepare to share a debate stage in Houston in two weeks\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are higher now but the race is still open,\u201d said Tom Vilsack, secretary of agriculture under Barack Obama and former governor of Iowa. \u201cA spark or a moment during the debate could catapult one of them forward.\u201d\n\nI think Kamala Harris\u2019s supporters are wondering: does she have a second act after the first act was such a success? Bill Galston\n\nPolling last week showed Biden held a comfortable lead at 32%, with Warren and Sanders jostling for second. A USA Today/Suffolk University survey found Warren at 14% and Sanders at 12%; Quinnipiac showed Warren at 19%, four points ahead of Sanders. In both polls, Harris and Buttigieg were the other candidates to top 5%.\n\nBut as Barack Obama and Donald Trump showed in 2008 and 2016, early assumptions and public polling are not always good indicators of who voters will choose.\n\nBiden has an advantage among black voters but faces competition from Harris and the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, the most prominent African American contenders who have targeted his record on race.\n\n\u201cThe nightmare scenario for Joe Biden is that Kamala Harris or Cory Booker emerge very strong in the Iowa caucuses and that leads to an erosion of support among African Americans,\u201d said Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe biggest moment of Harris\u2019 campaign so far was the first debate, when she clashed with Biden. But she has faded since. Galston said: \u201cI think Kamala Harris\u2019s supporters are wondering: does she have a second act after the first act was such a success?\u201d\n\nJoe Biden in Prole, Iowa, on 20 August.

His first TV ad hammers the point: \u201cWe have to beat Donald Trump and all the polls agree, Joe Biden is the strongest Democrat to do the job.\u201d But many argue that electability, a calculus that can include gender and racial bias, is not enough on its own.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t nominate someone who we\u2019re not excited about just because we\u2019re afraid and then turn around and ask the rest of the country to get excited about them,\u201d said Heather McGhee, a fellow at the progressive thinktank Demos.\n\nDemocrats are looking for \u201can exciting alternative to not just the last four years but also the last 40 years of rising inequality and insecurity\u201d, McGhee said. \u201cWe need someone who can meet the populist moment.\u201d\n\nThe field crosses the ideological spectrum, from democratic socialist to conservative Democrat; spans four decades in age; includes several women, candidates of color and a gay mayor; and contains veterans and a diversity of faiths and socio-economic backgrounds. That, said Mar\u00eda Urbina, national political director for Indivisible, a progressive grassroots organization, has stoked a \u201creal contest of ideas\u201d.", "description": "With Labor Day comes a time-honored transition to a more volatile stage of the race \u2013 and Biden has held on to his lead, but Warren and Sanders are right behindElizabeth Warren in Atlanta, Georgia, on 17 August.
