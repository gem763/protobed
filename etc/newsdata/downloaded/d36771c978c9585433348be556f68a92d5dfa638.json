However, the pair reunited and said \u201cI do\u201d again in 2011, 26 years after their divorce.\n\n\u201cNothing is an accident,\u201d the entertainer told People on Wednesday. \u201cI am a spiritual person. So [I believe] God has his timing.\u201d\n\nMARIE OSMOND'S SON WAS BULLIED BEFORE HIS SUICIDE: 'I NEVER TOOK ACTION'\n\nAccording to the outlet, Osmond was just 22 and fresh off her popular variety series \u201cDonny & Marie\u201d when she first married Craig. The pair first met when she was a teen. Less than a year later, the couple welcomed their son Stephen, now 36. However, Osmond admitted married life wasn\u2019t so blissful \u2014 at least the first time around.\n\n\u201cEveryone was telling me my career was over,\u201d she recalled, adding that her marriage to Craig \u201chad some trouble.\u201d They ultimately divorced.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden I\u2019m a single mom and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to pay my rent, let alone feed my kid,\u201d said Osmond. \u201cSo I decided I had to get back to work.\u201d\n\nMARIE OSMOND OPENS UP ABOUT FAMILY'S HEALTH ISSUES, HOW FAITH GETS HER THROUGH TROUBLED TIMES\n\nThe magazine shared Osmond began buying potential stage outfits from the Limited Express and hand sewing sequins onto the costumes. Within two years later, Osmond was at the top of the country music charts and enjoying a thriving career. She also married her second husband Brian Blosil in 1986.\n\nOsmond admitted to the outlet that she rushed into that relationship.\n\n\u201cYou have to be so careful not to jump into a relationship after you\u2019ve been through a sad one,\u201d explained Osmond. \u201cYou really need time on your own. And you need to know that you\u2019re a good person in order to find a good person.\u201d\n\nOsmond and Blosil\u2019s marriage ended in 2007. The couple shares six children. Osmond\u2019s son Michael died in 2010 at age 19.\n\nMARIE OSMOND RECALLS THE \u2018RIPPLE EFFECT\u2019 SON MICHAEL\u2019S SUICIDE LEFT ON FAMILY NEARLY 10 YEARS LATER\n\n\u201cI never wanted to be married again,\u201d said Osmond. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m good!\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, Osmond wasn\u2019t prepared to reconnect with Craig again through their son Stephen.\n\n\u201cThe thing about a second marriage is that you realize things you thought were so important, aren\u2019t,\u201d said Osmond. \u201cI love being with my husband. He is the sweetest man I know. He lives to serve and really listens to people\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nDespite rekindling their relationship, their son Stephen was initially \u201ca little scared\u201d of his parents getting back together decades later.\n\nMARIE OSMOND REFLECTS ON DATING RUMORS, BODY SHAMING AND BULLYING\n\n\u201cStephen was getting married and we [realized] we can\u2019t go to our son\u2019s wedding and not be married,\u201d said Osmond. \u201cSo we got married a few months before he did. He joked that he never thought it would happen, but it did!\u201d\n\nOsmond is in a much happier place, all thanks to her children.\n\nBack in 2007, the star collapsed in front of a stunned audience after her samba routine at \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d At the time, People reported host Tom Bergeron quickly sent the show to commercial as two medics and Osmond\u2019s manager rushed to her side. The ballroom was silent for more than a minute before Osmond was helped to her feet.\n\nAt the time, Osmond told the magazine she knew something was wrong even before her fall.\n\nDONNY AND MARIE OSMOND EXPLAIN WHY THEY ARE ENDING THEIR LAS VEGAS RESIDENCY\n\n\u201cDoing rehearsals, I was out of breath,\u201d she recalled. Osmond added that during the previous five years, she gained 40 lbs. while caring for her parents, each of whom battled heart disease at the end of their lives, and struggled with her divorce of Blosil.\n\n\u201c[My son Stephen] said, \u2018Mom, it would really be nice if you were there for my kids,\u2019\u201d said Osmond.\n\nThat\u2019s when Osmond decided to embark on a weight-loss journey.
