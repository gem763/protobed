I explained to them many times, how can I have a criminal case in Iran when I've been living here?', she told the publication via phone.\n\nThe beauty queen also reportedly said she thinks she has been targeted because she showed support for the exiled Reza Pahlavi, the son of the Shah of Iran overthrown in the country's 1979 revolution.\n\nShe used an image of him and the flag of the former Iranian monarchy as props during a beauty contest 'to try and be the voice of my people.'\n\nShe claims if sent back to her homeland, 'They will kill me,' she told The Telegraph, 'There is no updating, no information about the reason why [they] keep me here so long.'\n\nShe denies committing any crimes in either the Philippines or Iran, where she has studied dentistry since 2014 (pictured representing Iran at a beauty pageant)\n\nThe Philippine authorities said she had been 'restrained' from entering their territory because of the Red Notice.\n\nThe charge against Ms Bahari is one of assault and battery and relates to an alleged incident with an Iranian national in the Philippines.\n\nHowever, Markk Perete of the Philippine department of justice, told The Telegraph: 'We don't have any cause for refusing her entry for violation of our laws.'\n\nThe 31-year-old beauty queen says the allegation against her is a 'big lie'\n\nMs Bahari said she was returning from Dubai when immigration authorities took her to a room at the airport in Manila.\n\nOfficials explained there was issue with her visa before telling her to take a flight back to Iran.\n\nShe claims she called a friend for help, and then she sat on the floor and told officials she wasn't moving,\n\nThe friend who was called to help reportedly began crying and shouting and was arrested, with the Bureau of Immigration describing him as 'unruly' and breaching airport security in order to 'fetch his compatriot.'\n\n'Foreign nationals should respect our laws when they are in our country.
