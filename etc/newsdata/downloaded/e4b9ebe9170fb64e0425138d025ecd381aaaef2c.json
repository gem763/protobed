Naturalist and Springwatch presenter Chris Packham has described it as a 'promising' sign for the species.\n\n'Painted Lady came top overall in big butterfly count 2019, and was also the most numerous species recorded in each of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Its previous best performance in the Count was coming 13th in 2018 and it is typically one of the least frequently seen of the 19 target species,' explains the results.\n\nThe last mass painted lady migration in 2008 saw 11 million of the species grace UK shores, but this year has experienced even higher figures.\n\nThe Big Butterfly Count results 2019\n\nPainted Lady, 420,841 Peacock, 207,814 Small White, 179,715\n\nGatekeeper, 161,987 Large White, 138,671\n\nMeadow Brown, 110,858 Red Admiral, 91,146\n\nSmall Tortoiseshell, 70,704 Speckled Wood, 33,015\n\nGreen-veined White, 32,965 Comma, 32,137 Ringlet, 31,580 Common Blue, 23,604 Six-spot Burnet, 12,483 Holly Blue, 11,814 Small Copper, 10,905 Marbled White, 10,402 Brimstone, 9,261 Silver Y, 5,662\n\nChris Packham describes these mass butterfly migrations as 'one of the wonders of the natural world,' reports the BBC.
