This is unacceptable. We stand for health, fitness and developing potential and smoking isn\u2019t compatible with this philosophy. We are banning it for recruits from next week and will be smoke free for all in 2020. pic.twitter.com/CoWjzxdaen \u2014 Lt Col Rich Hall MBE (@CO_AFC) September 7, 2019 Report\n\nThe decision has met with broad support on Twitter, although one post described it as denying trainees \"the right to choose when in a few years you will be expecting them to defend that right if called upon\".\n\nLt Col Hall said he \"expected critics\", but the decision had been \"discussed at length over many months\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @GrumpyNige Odd that you are denying them the right to choose when in a few years you will be expecting them to defend that right if called upon. \u2014 GrumpyNige (@GrumpyNige) September 7, 2019 Report\n\nThe college trains recruits between the ages of 16 and 17.\n\nThe Army's website says it \"plays a vital role in providing basic military training and developing future leadership\".\n\nThe military has a higher proportion of smokers than the civilian population.\n\nFigures supplied by the Ministry of Defence in 2013 showed 33% of Army personnel were regular smokers. In comparison, in the same year a NHS report found 19% of adults smoked regularly.\n\nSince then the number of civilian smokers has dropped further, with the latest NHS figures reporting 14.7% of adults smoking.\n\nIt is against the law for under 18s to buy tobacco in England and Wales, although it is not illegal to smoke under the age of 18.\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
