The center said they involved \"confirmed and probable\" lung-injury cases.\n\nThe 26 confirmed deaths were in 21 states: Alabama, California (3), Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia (2), Illinois, Indiana, Kansas (2), Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Oregon (2), Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia.\n\nAmong 573 of the lung-injury cases, 76% reported using products containing THC, with or without nicotine-containing products. THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the chemical responsible for most of the psychological effects of marijuana.\n\nIs vaping safer than smoking? Depends who you ask, and what scientific study they point to\n\nAmong 1,043 patients where data on age and sex were available, 70% are male, 80% are under 35, the CDC said.\n\nIn this Oct. 4, 2019, photo, a woman using an electronic cigarette in Mayfield Heights, Ohio.

Cities such as San Francisco banned the sale and distribution of vaping devices.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Vaping illness: Cases surge to 1,299; deaths rise to 26", "description": "The number of lung injury cases linked to vaping has jumped to 1,299\u00a0and deaths to 26, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.", "authors": ["Doug Stanglin", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pOuiYx0xKwRD74yUj566Ng--~B/aD0zMTc1O3c9NDg2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/1888f63e1337f847a3f879b5d8da00cc", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
