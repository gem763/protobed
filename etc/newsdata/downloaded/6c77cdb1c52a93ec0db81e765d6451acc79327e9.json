Job Wallace was taken into custody Saturday night by Naval Criminal Investigative Service and other law enforcement officers at a rest area in Navarro County, according to a NCIS statement cited by The San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\nThe 20-year-old had last been seen leaving a friend\u2019s house in Surprise, Arizona, on Monday night, his mother, Stacy Wallace, said.
