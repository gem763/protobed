Trump\u2019s suspicious view of Ukraine set the stage for events that led to the impeachment inquiry against him.\n\nThe visit by Orban, who is seen as an autocrat who has rolled back democracy, provoked a sharp dispute within the White House. John Bolton, then the president\u2019s national security adviser, and Fiona Hill, then the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for Eurasian and Russian affairs, opposed a White House invitation for the Hungarian leader, according to the people briefed on the matter. But they were outmaneuvered by Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who supported such a meeting.\n\nAs a result, Trump at a critical moment in the Ukraine saga sat down in the Oval Office with a European leader with a fiercely negative outlook on Ukraine that fortified opinions he had heard from his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and from President Vladimir Putin of Russia repeatedly over the months and years.\n\nEchoing Putin\u2019s view, Orban has publicly accused Ukraine of oppressing its Hungarian minority and has cast his eye on a section of Ukraine with a heavy Hungarian population. His government has accused Ukraine of being \u201csemi-fascist\u201d and sought to block important meetings for Ukraine with the European Union and NATO.\n\nTen days after his meeting with Orban, Trump met on May 23 with several of his top advisers returning from the inauguration of Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The advisers, including Rick Perry, the energy secretary; Kurt D. Volker, then the special envoy for Ukraine; and Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, reassured Trump that Zelenskiy was a reformer who deserved U.S. support. But Trump expressed deep doubt, saying that Ukrainians were \u201cterrible people\u201d who \u201ctried to take me down\u201d during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nOrban\u2019s visit came up during testimony to House investigators last week by George P. Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine policy. The meeting with Orban and a separate May 3 phone call between Trump and Putin are of intense interest to House investigators seeking to piece together the back story that led to the president\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate Democrats.\n\nKent testified behind closed doors that another government official had held the two episodes up to him as part of an explanation for Trump\u2019s darkening views of Zelenskiy last spring, according to a person familiar with his testimony. A third factor cited to him was Giuliani\u2019s influence.\n\nKent did not have firsthand knowledge of either discussion, and it was not clear if the person who cited them did either. But two other people briefed on the matter said in interviews that Orban used the opportunity to disparage Ukraine with the president. The Washington Post first reported on the meeting with Orban and the call with Putin.\n\nIt would not be surprising that Putin would fill Trump\u2019s ear with negative impressions of Ukraine or Zelenskiy. Putin has long denied that Ukraine even deserved to be a separate nation, and he sent undercover forces into Crimea in 2014 to set the stage to annex the Ukrainian territory. Putin\u2019s government has also armed Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, fomenting a civil war that has dragged on for five years.\n\nBut allowing Orban to add his voice to that chorus set off a fight inside the West Wing. Bolton and Hill believed that Orban did not deserve the honor of an Oval Office visit, which would be seen as a huge political coup for an autocratic leader ostracized by many of his peers in Europe.\n\nMulvaney, however, had come to respect Orban from his time as a member of Congress and his involvement with the International Catholic Legislators Network, according to an administration official close to the acting chief of staff. Orban has positioned himself as a champion of Christians in the Middle East, a position that earned him Mulvaney\u2019s admiration, the official said.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Just 10 days before a key meeting on Ukraine, President Donald Trump met, over the objections of his national security adviser, with one of the former Soviet republic's most virulent critics, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, and heard a sharp assessment that bolstered his hostility", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "Nicholas Fandos"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
