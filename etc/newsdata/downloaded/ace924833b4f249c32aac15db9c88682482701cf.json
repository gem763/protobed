TABLE-Toronto home sales, prices rise in August as listings fall OTTAWA, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Toronto's housing market tightened in August, with fewer new listings than a year earlier despite an increase in sales, the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) said on Thursday. Total home sales climbed 13.4% from a year earlier, while listings fell by 3%. The average home price rose by 3.6%. \"Our housing supply has not kept up with population growth, which has led to pent-up housing demand,\" TREB Chief Executive John DiMichele said in a release. Condominiums led in price growth, the real estate board said, followed by higher density low rise home types and finally detached houses.
