This is a significant achievement for the company, because all those simulated miles on the road for its self-driving software add up to considerable training experience.\n\nWaymo also probably has the most experience when it comes to actual, physical road miles driven \u2014 the company is always quick to point out that it\u2019s been doing this far longer than just about anyone else working in autonomous driving, thanks to its head start as Google\u2019s self-driving car moonshot project.\n\n\u201cAt Waymo, we\u2019ve driven more than 10 million miles in the real world, and over 10 billion miles in simulation,\u201d Waymo CTO Dmitri Dolgov told TechCrunch\u2019s Kirsten Korosec on the Sessions: Mobility stage. \u201cAnd the amount of driving you do in both of those is really a function of the maturity of your system, and the capability of your system. If you\u2019re just getting started, it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 you\u2019re working on the basics, you can drive a few miles or a few thousand or tens of thousands of miles in the real world, and that\u2019s plenty to tell you and give you information that you need to know to improve your system.\u201d\n\nDolgov\u2019s point is that the more advanced your autonomous driving system becomes, the more miles you actually need to drive to have impact, because you\u2019ve handled the basics and are moving on to edge cases, advanced navigation and ensuring that the software works in any and every scenario it encounters. Plus, your simulation becomes more sophisticated and more accurate as you accumulate real-world driving miles, which means the results of your virtual testing is more reliable for use back in your cars driving on actual roads.\n\nThis is what leads Dolgov to the conclusion that Waymo\u2019s simulation is likely better than a lot of comparable simulation training at other autonomous driving companies.\n\n\u201cI think what makes it a good simulator, and what makes it powerful is two things,\u201d Dolgov said onstage. \u201cOne [is] fidelity. And by fidelity, I mean, not how good it looks. It\u2019s how well it behaves, and how representative it is of what you will encounter in the real world. And then second is scale.\u201d\n\nIn other words, experience isn\u2019t beneficial in terms of volume \u2014 it\u2019s about sophistication, maturity and readiness for commercial deployment.", "description": "Alphabet\u2019s Waymo autonomous driving company announced a new milestone at TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility on Wednesday: 10 billion miles driving in simulation.
