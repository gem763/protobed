Ross tells ABC News she's excited for the series to pivot to Rainbow's life.\n\n\"On 'black-ish' we often get to flashback into Dre's childhood, but this is a show that is an opportunity for us to zoom back into a big flashback of where Bow comes from and who she is,\" Ross says. \"So, in essence is what the show is.\"\n\nFrom commune to cul-de-sac, #mixedish is coming Tuesdays this fall to ABC. pic.twitter.com/GdqCMUQsss \u2014 mixed-ish (@mixedishabc) August 5, 2019\n\nRoss says while the new series will offer plenty of laughs, it will also provide a deeply relatable subject matter.\n\n\"It's the story of being a fish out of water. It's the experience that all of us have in many different ways,\" she said. \"And for many different reasons, where we are the one that is not like everybody else for some reason. And what that experience creates for you as a person, and how the journey is usually that you get to become more yourself.\"\n\nOf course, Ross will still get to play a part in the \"mixed-ish\" experience as the show's narrator, so she will be the one to tell Bow's story.\n\n\"We get to follow through the eyes of Bow, her family and her childhood through the backdrop of the binary eighties, where people were using language that we all now know is not appropriate,\" Ross says. \"And being in that environment as she kind of walks her way through this coming off of the commune and into mainstream world.\"\n\nFitting in is never easy.

In fact, Bow and her siblings start off the series not knowing they're different.\n\nGosselaar gushed about how much he loved pretending to live on a commune and, especially, enjoyed the wardrobe.\n\n\"[The clothes] are comfortable, they are comfortable,\" he says. \"I get more compliments for those type of clothes than any other character I've ever played. I've played well dressed lawyers, I get more compliments for these clothes.\"\n\n\"mixed-ish\" premieres Tuesday night on ABC at 9 p.m. ET.", "description": "Tracee Ellis Ross and Mark Paul Gosselaar are ready for viewers to see the beginnings of Ross'", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/mixed-ish-abc-ps-190924_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
