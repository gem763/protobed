Critical illness cover, meanwhile, pays out a lump sum if you are diagnosed with one of a specified list of serious illnesses.\n\nFor many families, taking out life insurance is a sensible decision, as it provides your loved ones with piece of mind that the mortgage will be covered should you die.\n\nBut if you do not have children, you may find a policy that covers your income in the event you are unable to work more suitable.\n\nKevin Carr, chief executive of Protection Review, says: 'These days, people don't tend to die until they are much older, whereas they are more likely to be off work. Yet only 100,000 people a year buy income protection, while one million buy life insurance.'\n\nNone of these insurance policies is compulsory, however. Buildings insurance is the only cover typically required as a condition of obtaining a mortgage.\n\nIt is also vital that you do not accept the first deal you are offered without checking if you can get a better price elsewhere.\n\nResearch by comparison website ActiveQuote.com reveals that many people fail to do this. According to its survey of 2,000 UK adults, more than a third (35 per cent) say they bought life insurance from their mortgage provider or financial adviser.\n\nA further 8 per cent were unaware that they could even shop around for a cheaper deal (12 per cent in the case of income protection).\n\nRod Jones, head of partnerships at ActiveQuote.com, says: 'Our research highlights that there is still a lot of misinformation about what is required to get a mortgage, with one in five admitting they don't understand what life and income protection insurance covers.\n\n'While it is advisable to protect yourself when taking on a home loan, it is not a legal requirement.\n\n'Taking out a mortgage is a stressful process and, if you are being advised that you have to take something, you tend just to agree. A lot of the money brokers make is from added products.'\n\nAnthony Emmerson, director of Mayfair-based Trinity Financial, says brokers dealing in lower-value loans could earn far more from selling life insurance policies than from the mortgage itself.\n\nHe says: 'If the average house price is \u00a3200,000, the broker is going to earn three or four times as much commission on the insurance as they are on the mortgage. That might be a driver for them to say it was compulsory, but it would be mis-selling.'\n\nMike Begg, a former banker who now runs claims firm Beat The Banks, says: 'Most brokers, as well as banks, are tied to a single insurance provider and charge more than the base cost of the policy \u2014 known as the business partner rate. It could mean a mark-up of as much as 40 per cent.'\n\nWhen marketing executive Bethan Rees, 27, wanted to get a mortgage on a two-bedroom flat in Cardiff, she turned to her bank, Barclays.\n\nShe says: 'I spoke to an adviser and understood that to complete the mortgage, one of the requirements would be to take out life insurance. They said we could shop around, or they had a recommended product.'\n\nBuildings insurance is the only cover typically required as a condition of obtaining a mortgage\n\nShe and her partner, Peter, 26, agreed to take the \u00a3120,000 joint life and critical illness cover with Legal & General offered by the bank at \u00a332 a month.\n\nThey have since discovered on comparison site Confused.com that, had they gone direct to Legal & General, it would have cost just \u00a327 \u2014 nearly 16 per centless or a saving of \u00a31,500 over the 25-year loan.\n\nMs Rees says: 'As we were first-time buyers, everything was new to us, so, for the sake of ease, we opted for the policy provider the bank recommended. In hindsight, we would have preferred to shop around, but there is so much to consider when buying a house.'\n\nA Barclays spokesperson says: 'As a responsible lender, all customers are informed that when arranging a mortgage, life and critical illness protection is not a condition of a Barclays mortgage. The optional nature of mortgage protection is confirmed in documentation provided to customers.\n\n'After reviewing this case, we are satisfied that the protection sale aligns with our expected standards.'\n\nMr Carr says: 'When people are taking on a mortgage, they have got so much on their plate. They really need to revisit it a few months later when they are settled in.'\n\nNever pick a policy purely based on price without checking you have the level of cover you need.", "description": "Our research reveals more than three in ten borrowers have been told life insurance is a legal requirement, while a further third say they were advised that they couldn't get a loan without it.", "authors": ["Iona Bain For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
