Not governments. Not businesses. And certainly not the general public.\n\nAs parts of the state went dark, the California governor Gavin Newsom told reporters he was \u201coutraged because it didn\u2019t have to happen\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in bankruptcy due to their terrible management going back decades. They\u2019ve created these conditions, it was unnecessary,\u201d he said about PG&E. \u201cThis can\u2019t be the new normal.\u201d\n\nBut Newsom also called public safety power shutoffs in cases of potential wildfire risk \u201cnot novel\u201d. State regulators approved PG&E\u2019s plans. And the municipalities that called on vulnerable residents to use personal resources to preemptively evacuate knew this was coming.\n\nThe widescale public safety power shutdown revealed the depth of California\u2019s infrastructure problems amid a growing climate crisis, as \u201cde-energizing\u201d policy trades one possible disaster for another.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole series of missteps over a long period of time by PG&E and by a whole bunch of other actors that led us to this point,\u201d said Costa Samaras, a climate resilience researcher and analyst, and associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cWhat is clear is whatever this giant mess is, it\u2019s not in any way acceptable or sustainable.\u201d\n\nPG&E and de-energizing\n\nPG&E made shutting down its grid in dry, windy weather a core part of its wildfire management strategy in 2018, after the company faced $30bn in liabilities for their role in sparking two of the deadliest and costliest fires in California history. PG&E filed for bankruptcy shortly after.\n\nWith its new \u201csafety plan\u201d, the company essentially admitted that keeping the lights on was dangerous \u2013 and potentially very expensive for its own bottom line. By choosing to shut down the grid this week, the utility might have stopped another spark \u2013 and another massive bill.\n\nPG&E may be a public utility \u2013 the biggest electric utility in the US \u2013 and it may have been shutting off its lines to millions of people in the interest of public safety, but it is not, and has never been, owned by the public.\n\nWith their huge monopoly markets and guaranteed rates of return, California utilities are attractive businesses for investors. Earlier this year, utilities asked the state for an even bigger payday. Meanwhile, PG&E invested millions in state lobbying, paid out $4.5bn in profits to shareholders over the last five years, and millions in executive bonuses \u2013 all while deferring necessary maintenance and repairs to its system.\n\n\u201cA lot of money went to dividends that should\u2019ve gone to your trees,\u201d a federal judge told the company in April.\n\nPG&E equipment has been blamed for sparking 17 out of 23 major fires across the state in 2017, and the 2018 Camp fire that all but destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people. Following those two devastating fire seasons, PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection to cover its liability costs, which are expected to total upwards of $30bn, compared to the company\u2019s market cap of $20bn. Any liabilities incurred from a new, large, devastating wildfire might have impacted the company\u2019s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest PG&E shut off power to roughly 800,000 customers across 34 northern California counties this week.

There\u2019s lots of executive branch authority over this situation,\u201d said Leah Stokes, utilities researcher and political science professor at UC Santa Barbara. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a blunt instrument to use on the problem.\u201d\n\nAfter this week, there are many open questions as to how PG&E considers the problem and assesses fire risk.\n\n\u201cThe forecast didn\u2019t call for unprecedented extreme fire weather conditions. The power shutoff was unprecedented, but the weather conditions were not,\u201d said Daniel Swain, climate scientist at UCLA\u2019s Institute of the Environment and Sustainability. \u201cIt isn\u2019t entirely clear what did go into that decision. We don\u2019t know publicly what PG&E\u2019s thresholds are.\u201d\n\nState rules leave utilities to control when they\u2019ll shut down the power, and how they\u2019ll choose to do it. PG&E\u2019s de-energizing plan calls for the consideration of a variety of criteria and conditions when it comes to initiating a public safety power shutoff. According to the plan, \u201cNo single factor drives a Public Safety Power Shutoff.\u201d\n\nSome factors include: a national weather service \u201cred flag warning\u201d of high fire weather, low humidity levels, forecasted sustained winds, the availability of dry vegetation or fuels, and \u201con-the-ground, real-time observations from PG&E crews\u201d. But there are no hard rules or numbers by which PG&E abides when deciding whether or not to subjectively shut off the grid to millions of people in California.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest PG&E\u2019s de-energizing plan calls for a consideration of a variety of criteria and conditions. Photograph: Jeff Chiu/Associated Press\n\nCalifornia could easily meet those vague criteria a few times a year, said Swain.\n\n\u201cIf this is the risk aversion strategy that a private utility is going to take but we\u2019re going to be hitting those thresholds an awful lot in the present climate and might hit it even more frequently in a warmer future climate, that doesn\u2019t seem to be a very realistic longterm solution,\u201d said Swain. \u201cThe notion of doing this for anything short of a real emergency puts a huge burden on a lot of people.\u201d\n\nRegulatory and ownership solutions\n\nAnd even as a business decision, for PG&E, it\u2019s an inherently short-sighted one. \u201cYou\u2019re losing a lot of money by putting people out of power versus if you were undergrounding lines, or made microgrids, or solar and battery backup,\u201d said Stokes. \u201cYou could make those investments once and then have benefits in the future. Now you just have the costs without those investments.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this kind of management that\u2019s inspired a campaign to nationalize the electricity grid.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental contradiction between PG&E\u2019s mandate to make as much profit as they can for their shareholders and invest in the health and safety of Californians,\u201d said Keith Brower Brown, co-chair of the East Bay chapter of Democratic Socialists of America, which launched a campaign for the public takeover of PG&E in 2018. \u201cWe\u2019re not naive to the fact that there have been public utilities that have had problems too \u2013 just because something\u2019s public doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s run well. But there\u2019s a path to accountability when you have public control.\u201d\n\nBut more control and regulation alone won\u2019t necessarily fix PG&E\u2019s management, nor the grid itself.\n\n\u201cThe only way out of this bind is not only public ownership of the company but a massive scale public investment in building the kind of safe, clean energy infrastructure that we need,\u201d said Brown.\n\nAs it stands, those investments and priorities are controlled and directed by a profit-motivated PG&E. Newsom, the California governor, warned that changes to PG&E will come slowly \u2013 the company operates more than 125,000 transmission and distribution power lines across roughly 70,000 square miles of the state. PG&E previously put the cost of inspecting and repairing every bit of its grid at $150bn.\n\nSo the public is left to bear the costs and risks in the meantime of a new kind of disaster, along with the familiar ones.\n\n\u201cNobody is investing for climate resilience at the level that\u2019s necessary and that\u2019s really what\u2019s concerning about this incident \u2013 this is one of the richest areas of the country and if we can\u2019t even figure it out there, we\u2019re going to have problems,\u201d said Costa Samaras, a climate resilience researcher and analyst, and associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n\u201cTo me this is a real learning opportunity to find where the resilience gaps are, find out who\u2019s vulnerable, and fix it before it gets worse,\u201d said Samaras. \u201cThis is the challenge, not just for PG&E but for the whole ecosystem: businesses, municipalities, counties.
