It\u2019s time to close ranks on the ground!\u201d shouts Tori, an energetic 20-year-old organiser.\n\nA young Berliner, she and other activists prefer not to be named.\n\nOn this cold autumn morning, the XR group is training non-violent civil disobedience, a core technique of the movement since it was founded in Britain last year.\n\nAround 150 people, from dyed-in-the-wool supporters to total climate protest beginners, have gathered at the \u201cHouse of Statistics\u201d, a former East German government building close to the unmistakeable TV tower at Alexanderplatz.\n\nIn a crash course lasting just three hours, they are being integrated into a global environmentalist movement that has made itself felt across the world since Monday.\n\nThe roughly gender-balanced attendees are mostly young, between 20 and 30, and white.\n\nSitting on the ground wearing woollen hats and scarves against the long hours exposed to the chill, the would-be demonstrators fold their arms beneath their thighs.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Little package\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cTurn yourself into a little package,\u201d one of the organisers advises.\n\nHis dreadlocks tied into a bun, he encourages participants to come together in \u201cbuddy groups\u201d of ten or so strong to provide mutual support during the sit-ins.\n\nThen fellow activists playing the role of police begin lifting them from the ground to clear them away.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m arrested, should I let them take my photo and my fingerprints?\u201d asks one man.\n\n\u201cCan I wear an animal face mask?\u201d asks another.\n\nA third wonders \u201cCan I ask them for vegan food while I\u2019m in custody?\u201d\n\nNow the assembly have gathered around a disused dodgem car stand and are passing around a flask of hot tea.\n\n\u201cHide your face as little as possible during an action\u2026 keep ID on you\u2026 leave your mobile phone at home,\u201d Tori advises.\n\nEveryone should \u201cask themselves what their limits are\u201d before blocking a bridge or stopping car traffic, she adds, saying none of the 150 people present should feel bad about leaving a barricade before the police arrive or failing to expose themselves to arrest.\n\nA 28-year-old student calling himself \u201cthe lion\u201d tells AFP he\u2019s happy to go all the way.\n\n\u201cCivil disobedience is the only way to make my voice heard,\u201d he believes.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Pacifism\u2019 \u2013\n\nEven so, \u201cI\u2019m a pacifist, and I\u2019ve never been in a fight,\u201d the young man adds.\n\nNearby, two women are following XR\u2019s guidelines by marking a phone number for a legal advice service on their arms, giving them a contact in case they are arrested.\n\n\u201cExtinction Rebellion does not commit crimes,\u201d Tori tells her audience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that you don\u2019t attack anyone either. Our top priority is non-violence,\u201d she insists, repeating the message several times.\n\nAround 2:00 pm, the training is over, and there is no time for a break before another hundred-odd people arrive for the day\u2019s second session.\n\n\u201cBack when we started in February, we were doing one or two training sessions a month. Now it\u2019s three per week, and five per day these last few days,\u201d she tells AFP.\n\nAnother activist shows up asking \u201cif I\u2019m cleared out by the police, am I allowed to come back and rejoin the sit-in?\u201d, dragging the young trainer back into her work.", "description": "Berlin (AFP) \u2013 Seated on the floor, Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists are rehearsing blocking a street at the base of a disused building in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/e8c282_activists-extinction-rebellion-members-demonstrate-potsdamer-platz-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
