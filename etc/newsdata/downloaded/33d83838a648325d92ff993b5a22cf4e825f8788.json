The commission says it found that argument to be untrue.\n\nIran has already missed some events because it was provisionally suspended last month pending the full disciplinary ruling.\n\nThe IJF has previously said any measures taken against Iran won't apply directly to next year's Olympics, because athletes are technically entered by the Iranian Olympic Committee, not the national judo federation.\n\nHowever, qualifying for the Olympics depends in large part on world ranking points from IJF events.\n\nIran can appeal the IJF ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nThe measure comes at a time when the International Olympic Committee is pushing back against boycotts and other political demonstrations in sports.\n\nIn June, IOC President Thomas Bach criticized governments who \"clearly abuse sport for their political purposes,\" noting a case in May of a Tunisian court blocking four Israelis from competing at the taekwondo junior world championships.", "description": "Iran was banned from international judo competitions Tuesday for refusing to let its athletes fight Israeli opponents.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/JUDO-Iran.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
