There are $25 tickets at a refurbished standing room only area at the highest point inside the Wells Fargo Center and Comcast Spectacor installed a Kinetic 4K center-hung scoreboard that makes Gritty look like Godzilla on the big screen. There\u2019s even a sports book for fans who want to place a wager on the home team while they\u2019re sipping a craft cocktail called \u201cThe Sexy Franklin.\u201d\n\nBut the improvements to the arena the Flyers share with the 76ers hasn\u2019t exactly trickled down to the roster. Even with the top-shelf amenities, fireplaces and artwork, the Flyers are longshots to (+3600) to win it all.\n\nThey haven\u2019t won the Stanley Cup since 1974 and 1975, currently the fourth-longest drought in the NHL. The Flyers missed the playoffs for the fourth time in seven seasons, haven\u2019t made it to the second round since 2012 and will hit 10 years since their last Stanley Cup Final appearance.\n\nThe new addition the Flyers are really counting is the one on the bench.\n\nAlain Vigneault, known for quick fixes and who led Vancouver and the New York Rangers to the Stanley Cup Final, was hired as the latest coach. Vigneault certainly boasts the credentials that prove he\u2019s capable of turning the Flyers into winners. He has coached 16 NHL seasons for the Montreal Canadiens, Canucks and Rangers and his teams have made the playoffs 11 times.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a coach that knows what it takes to go far in the playoffs and win,\u201d Flyers center Sean Couturier said.\n\nThe Flyers gamble on college coach Dave Hakstol backfired and so did their commitment to former general manager Ron Hextall when he laid out a long-term rebuilding plan that was short on immediate playoff results. The Flyers hired Chuck Fletcher last December in hopes he can resuscitate the franchise and make the orange-and-black again known for more than their googly-eyed mascot.\n\nThe champion St. Louis Blues showed it could be done - they were the worst team in the NHL in January.\n\nThe Flyers hope their hectic early season travel schedule doesn\u2019t derail their efforts: Philadelphia plays a final preseason game in Switzerland, opens the season in the Czech Republic, plays one home game on Oct. 9 and then heads to Western Canada for three games in five days. Did someone say jet lag?\n\nWHO\u2019S HERE\n\nVigneault. F Kevin Hayes, D Matt Niskanen, D Justin Braun. Hayes signed a $50 million, seven-year contract that\u2019s worth $7.14 million a season. Hayes became the Flyers\u2018 third-highest paid player behind captain Claude Giroux and winger Jakub Voracek and steps in as their new No. 2 center behind Couturier. He\u2019s coming off a career-high 55 points last season with the Rangers and Jets.\n\nWHO\u2019S NOT\n\nKate Smith. Don\u2019t laugh. Smith\u2019s connection with the Flyers started in 1969 and her rendition of \u201cGod Bless America\u201d was a popular ritual through the years. She even had a statue across the street from the stadium in the sports complex. But the statue was yanked amid allegations of racism against the 1930s star and her video recording will not be played again. D Radko Gudas, C Jori Lehtera and D Andrew MacDonald are among the notable departures.\n\nKEY PLAYERS\n\nAll eyes are the 21-year-old Hart, who is expected to steady one of the shakiest positions throughout most of the franchise\u2019s history. He stopped his first 25 shots in preseason action and looks capable of becoming a top-tier goalie. The Flyers used an NHL-record eight goalies last season, but Carter was by far the best and showed enough flashes of promise that he could possibly steal a playoff spot for the Flyers.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nThe Flyers are trying to shift from building to trying to contend for a title. Hextall\u2019s regime was about drafting and developing, and Fletcher is turning his attention to making Philadelphia a playoff contender again. The Flyers should at least contend for one of the final playoff spots in the East and could snag one if once-prized prospects Shayne Gostisbehere and Nolan Patrick play to their potential.\n\nPREDICTION\n\nGritty will entertain the heck out of sports fans like no other mascot. As such, Gritty will continue to be must-see - but his postseason debut will have to wait at least one more season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The parent company of the Philadelphia Flyers has spent the weeks leading up to the season unveiling their best offseason acquisitions.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Gelston"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/flyers_preview_hockey_55611_c0-117-2787-1741_s1770x1032.jpg?ebbfce6751f32df028db241936b79ec69cb50dab", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
