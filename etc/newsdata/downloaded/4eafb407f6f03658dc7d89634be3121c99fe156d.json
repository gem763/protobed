Tracy was left feeling disgusted and shattered when a guilty Kerry admitted her role in the fire which killed Frank.\n\nUnable to take it anymore, Kerry came clean but Amy (Natalie Ann Jamieson) wasn\u2019t prepared for her to take the full fall and admitted to Tracy that she was to blame too. Tracy was horrified and decided that she would let the police made the decision.\n\nKerry made a grab for her phone and she and Amy tried to calm the situation down. But Tracy darted out the back door, pursued by a desperate Kerry. After Tracy pushed her away from her, Kerry fell to the ground, hitting her head on a pile of rocks.\n\nAs she was left motionless, Tracy and Amy were left shaken by the turn of events. As Kerry is rushed to hospital, it emerges that she is in a very serious condition \u2013 and about to take a turn for the worst.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what now?\n\nNatalie told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Kerry is really badly hurt and it\u2019s touch and so obviously now, there\u2019s not just the secret about the fire in the mix. Everyone here has made serious mistakes, and everyone could end up paying for them in some way. It\u2019ll be good to see how the audience takes to it because it could go a number of ways from here.\u2019\n\nAs emotions run high, next week things get even worse. As Vanessa Woodfield (Michelle Hardwick) argues with Amy in the hospital, she lashes out and accidentally hits a nurse. Vanessa is arrested and ends up in a cell \u2013 but could Amy and Tracy soon be locked up themselves for both the fire and Kerry\u2019s injuries?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Kerry is in a serious condition.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/03_10_coro_kerry_fall_2nd_ep_02-68be_1570120577.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
