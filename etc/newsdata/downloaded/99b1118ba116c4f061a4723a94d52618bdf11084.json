Elizabeth Warren went viral online Thursday for her hypothetical response to someone who doesn\u2019t agree with gay marriage.\n\nDuring a CNN town hall focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked what she would say to someone on the campaign trail who told her: \u201cI\u2019m old fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that, and I\u2019m going to say, \u2018Then just marry one woman. I\u2019m cool with that,\u2019\u201d Ms. Warren said.\n\nAfter letting the crowd laugh and applaud, she added, \u201cAssuming you can find one,\u201d which drew an even bigger response from the audience.\n\nMs. Warren has been steadily rising in Democratic polls over the last few months and has begun challenging Vice President Joseph R. Biden on his front-runner status.\n\nWhile many praised Ms. Warren\u2019s performance, Mr. Biden was heavily criticized for an odd reference to gay bathhouses while being asked about racial disparities in health care, including HIV.\n\n\u201cWe talked about this in San Francisco, it was all about, you know gay bathhouses. It\u2019s all about round the clock sex, it\u2019s all \u2026 c\u2019mon man!\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
