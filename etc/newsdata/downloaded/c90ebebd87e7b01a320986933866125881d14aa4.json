The lavish apartment with 360-degree views also comes fully furnished thanks to Los Angeles-based interior design team MASS Beverly.\n\n\n\nThe top apartment in the 55-unit new development floats 700 feet over San Francisco and boasts two-and-a-half tennis courts\u2019 worth of space.\n\n\n\nMore: With Possible U.S. Economic Downturn on the Horizon, It Pays to Take Out a Mortgage\n\nThe final design features pale hardwood floors, slab marble and a variety of modern light fixtures, which interior designers Mary Ta and Lars Hypko layered with a cornucopia of brand-name furnishings, from chairs by fashion house Bottega Veneta to a 400-liter freestanding tub by Antonio Lupi, according to an extensive fact sheet provided by the developer.\n\n\n\nFor instance, the elevator opens into a private walnut-panelled lobby with a sculptural, copper-finished bench by Mauro Mori Ioegio. A variety of cream- and khaki-colored sofas decorate the living room, from which the neighboring study is in full view due to a set of sliding glass doors.\n\n\n\nA copper-finished bench by Mauro Mori Ioegio Matthew Millman\n\nWhile technically a four-bedroom unit, it\u2019s currently configured with three bedrooms and a high-end home gym occupying the fourth. There\u2019s also a wine cellar and tasting bar, an informal dining room and a secondary family room.\n\nMASS Beverly, which has done homes for Beyonce and Calvin Klein, chose earthy tones for most of the home with the exception of blue accents\u2014such as a velvet armchair in one of the bedrooms\u2014a color that ties into the San Francisco Bay below.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the views are the home\u2019s main attraction, said Matt Lituchy, CIO of the Jay Paul Company, the developer.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are none better in San Francisco,\u201d Mr. Lituchy said. \u201cThey are 360 degrees and they include views of every major landmark in the San Francisco Bay area.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom a 12-seat dining room table, one has a straight shot view over the Golden Gate Bridge and across the bay to Mount Diablo.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Monet\u2019s \u2018Charing Cross Bridge\u2019 Could Fetch $30 Million at Sotheby\u2019s\n\nSafety was a chief concern in the construction of 181 Fremont, as one of the tallest skyscrapers in the earthquake-prone city. Mr. Lituchy called it \u201cthe most seismically sound residential buildings in the world,\u201d with 42 of the caissons drilled more than 260 feet into the bedrock.\n\n\n\nAt the moment, the grand penthouse also boasts some $7 million worth of contemporary artwork, which is for sale through separate negotiation, Mr. Lituchy said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-116338?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
