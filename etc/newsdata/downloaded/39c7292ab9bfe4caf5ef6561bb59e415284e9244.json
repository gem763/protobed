Trump has said the Turkish assault is a \u201cbad idea\u201d that he does not endorse, but that he does not want U.S. troops in its path.\n\nIn a tweet on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed solidarity with the Kurds, although he did not mention Trump\u2019s decision to withhold protection for them.\n\n\u201cIsrael strongly condemns the Turkish invasion of the Kurdish areas in Syria and warns against the ethnic cleansing of the Kurds by Turkey and its proxies,\u201d Netanyahu wrote. \u201cIsrael is prepared to extend humanitarian assistance to the gallant Kurdish people.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Syria about-face was the latest in recent steps that have stirred discomfort within Netanyahu\u2019s conservative cabinet, which had previously seen itself and the Trump administration as marching in lock-step.\n\nIn a speech on Thursday, Netanyahu stressed Israel\u2019s self-sufficiency - a change of tone from his promotion in two election campaigns this year of his personal rapport with Trump and of a proposed Israeli-U.S. defence treaty.\n\n\u201cWe very much appreciate the important U.S. backing, which has only increased greatly in recent years (but) we always remember and apply the basic rule that guides us: Israel will defend itself, by itself, against any threat,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nOfficials close to the prime minister are quick to talk up Trump\u2019s unprecedentedly pro-Israel policy moves, such as quitting the Iran nuclear deal and recognising Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and the Golan Heights as Israeli-annexed.\n\nLIABILITY\n\nBut, in private, few dispute that Trump\u2019s unpredictability and transactional attitude toward strategy can be a liability.\n\nA cartoon in the left-wing Israeli daily Haaretz showed Trump, from the safety of a trench, bidding Netanyahu \u201cso long!\u201d as the Israeli leader unhappily storms Iran alone.\n\nIn media interviews, Israeli officials were quizzed over whether Trump had \u201cbetrayed\u201d the Kurds - a term they seemed hard-put to deny.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to define it in words because it is not my job to educate the United States,\u201d Yuval Steinitz, a member of Netanyahu\u2019s security cabinet and Likud party, told Ynet TV.\n\nIsrael has maintained discreet military, intelligence and business ties with the Kurds since the 1960s, viewing the minority ethnic group \u2014 whose indigenous population is split between Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Iran \u2014 as a buffer against shared adversaries.\n\nIt sees the Kurds of Syria as a counterweight to Islamist insurgents and worries that other, Iranian-aligned foes might also fill the vacuum left by a disengaged United States.\n\nTrump\u2019s recent diplomatic outreach to Tehran, in parallel to his firing of hawkish National Security Adviser John Bolton, also gave Israelis pause.\n\n\u201cI think the U.S. isolationist approach is problematic for the entire world, and for our region as well,\u201d Steinitz said.\n\n\u201cHad the United States taken the same isolationist attitude in World War One and World War Two, it\u2019s possible that Germany would now be ruling the whole world.\u201d\n\nAn Israeli official close to Netanyahu hinted that any tensions over Trump\u2019s Syria decision were being addressed by the allies over private channels. These are abundant, and include Israel\u2019s envoy to Washington, who has an open door at the White House, and the U.S. envoy to Israel, a career Trump confidant.\n\n\u201cSome things are better dealt with away from the public eye,\u201d the Israeli official said on condition of anonymity.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to stand aside as Turkey sends troops into Syria and fights Kurds allied with Washington has some Israelis wondering whether they too might eventually pay a price for his impatience with Middle East engagements.", "authors": ["Dan Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
