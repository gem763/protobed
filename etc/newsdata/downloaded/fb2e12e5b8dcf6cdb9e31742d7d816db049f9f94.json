The Duke of Sussex candidly tackles the topic in ITV\u2019s new documentary Harry & Meghan: An African Journey, which airs in the U.S. on Wednesday. So, what\u2019s the verdict on Harry and William\u2019s supposed tension? Well, Harry doesn\u2019t exactly say he and William aren\u2019t on the outs but, regardless, he insists they\u2019ll \u201calways be brothers.\u201d\n\nThe reality is that being a royal comes with the kind of scrutiny most of us can\u2019t even fathom being subjected to, much less having to live with daily. Per People, the documentary sees Harry discussing the pressure of his and William\u2019s roles in the royal family when he opens up about the rumored sibling strife. \u201cInevitably stuff happens. But we\u2019re brothers, we\u2019ll always be brothers. We\u2019re certainly on different paths at the moment,\u201d Harry admitted, adding, \u201cI\u2019ll always be there for him and as I know, he\u2019ll always be there for me. We don\u2019t see each other as much as we used to because we\u2019re so busy, but I love him dearly.\u201d\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nHarry also pointed out, \u201cThe majority of stuff [about a rift] is created out of nothing. As brothers, we have good days and we have bad days.\u201d And, c\u2019mon, anyone who has a sibling knows the latter half of that statement tracks.\n\nSpeculation about bad blood between the brothers really started to take hold in April, when Harry and William formally and officially split their joint household. William and Kate Middleton stayed on at Kensington Palace and took over the @kensingtonroyal Instagram account. Harry and Meghan moved into Frogmore Cottage on the Queen\u2019s Windsor Castle estate, launching the new @sussexroyal Instagram account.\n\nHowever, the separation could very well have much less to do with Harry\u2019s relationship with William and much more to do with his (and Meghan\u2019s) relationship with the British media. In a clip from the documentary released earlier this week, Meghan admitted the intense scrutiny of the U.K. press has been extremely difficult, saying, \u201cNot many people have asked if I\u2019m okay, but it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nHappily, though, Harry and Meghan should soon be able to take a breather from sibling feud rumors and the British paparazzi \u2014 they\u2019re reportedly taking a six-week \u201cfamily time\u201d hiatus from royal responsibilities, and rumor has it they\u2019re headed to Meghan\u2019s hometown of L.A. for baby Archie\u2019s first Thanksgiving.\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
