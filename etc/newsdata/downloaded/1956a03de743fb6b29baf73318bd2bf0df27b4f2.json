There also was a scavenger hunt trash pickup throughout the park; mulching trees; and painting railings around a field house.\n\n\u201cDouglas is one of these big city parks where some areas have been done and some have not,\u201d said Anna Isaacson, the NFL\u2019s senior vice president of social responsibility. \u201cWe looked at what parts could use sprucing up, making it a better place for the kids, and making some new trails. They identified key areas that need touching up.\u201d\n\nThe NFL\u2019s goal is to get 100 million minutes of volunteer time for such causes and currently is almost at 20 million before the season has begun. The previous two national events were in Nashville around the draft , and in Canton, Ohio before the Pro Football Hall of Fame inductions.\n\n\u201cIf you have ever volunteered, you get a special high from being around people who share interest and share wanting to leave a legacy,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cWherever we do these projects, we know the NFL brings people together, and to be able to get them in volunteering is getting that special feeling.\u201d\n\nEach NFL team will be staging its own events as well; some already have. There is a monthly award for getting fans to donate the most volunteer time, with a $5,000 grant going to a community project. The club that has had the most volunteers for the 100th season will get $100,000 for similar projects.\n\nThree clubs have won local grants: the Rams, Seahawks and Vikings.\n\nAmong the national huddles ahead will be one in October during Breast Cancer Awareness month, and one in November, when the league salutes the military.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The NFL staged its third national NFL Huddle for 100 event Wednesday at Douglas Park, with beautifying areas of the park the main goal.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
