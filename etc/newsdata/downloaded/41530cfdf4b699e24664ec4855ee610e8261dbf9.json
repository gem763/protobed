Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) \u201cpromised\u201d Monday that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh won\u2019t be impeached following the revelation of another sexual misconduct allegation against him.\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee vowed in a tweet that Kavanaugh would not be brought down by these \u201cscurrilous accusations\u201d \u2014 despite mounting calls for his impeachment.\n\nAs Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I promise you Justice Kavanaugh will not be impeached over these scurrilous accusations.https://t.co/MBpW3G8zOk \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 16, 2019\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), head of the House Judiciary Committee, said Monday that his committee is too tied up \u2014 at least for now \u2014 with \u201cimpeaching the president\u201d to take immediate action concerning Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cWe have our hands full with impeaching the president right now, and that\u2019s going to take up our limited resources and time for a while,\u201d Nadler said on WNYC.\n\nThough the House would have to pass articles of impeachment against Kavanaugh, the Senate would conduct the trial.\n\nDemocratic presidential contenders, lawmakers and former U.S. attorneys are calling for a new investigation into Kavanaugh and the FBI investigation into his background that was conducted for his confirmation hearings.\n\nThis was almost a year ago.\n\n\n\nIt is unsurprising that Kavanaugh, credibly accused of sexual assault, would lie under oath to secure a Supreme Court seat.\n\n\n\nBecause sexual assault isn\u2019t a crime of passion - it\u2019s about the abuse of power.\n\n\n\nHe must be impeached.pic.twitter.com/9PhrgeYuHv \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 16, 2019\n\nKavanaugh college classmate Max Stier told two New York Times journalists that he saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at a drunken Yale University party where friends pushed Kavanaugh\u2019s penis into the hands of a female student, according to a report Saturday. The woman involved has said she did not recall the incident, but Stier said he was a witness, according to the Times.\n\nThe report was similar to an allegation lodged against Kavanaugh last year by former Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez. Stier informed senators and the FBI of the incident during Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings, but it was never investigated, the Times journalists reported.\n\nAt the time of Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination, a California psychology reseacher, Christine Blasey Ford, publicly accused Kavanaugh of pinning her to a bed and trying to take off her clothes at a party when they were both in high school. She testified about her experience before senators at the confirmation hearings.", "description": "And Democratic Rep.
