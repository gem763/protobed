Joao Cancelo - 4/10 He has only played 36 minutes in a City shirt despite being one of the best full backs in Europe. His time will come, but at the moment he is experiencing the same frustration Danilo endured behind Kyle Walker. Manchester City FC via Getty Ima 2/20 19. Moise Kean - 4/10 Last season he emerged as one of the best young forwards in Europe at Juventus. He has failed to live up to the hype so far at Everton, but it\u2019s still early in his Premier League career. Everton FC via Getty Images 3/20 18. David Luiz - 4/10 His move surprised many when he joined Arsenal from London rivals Chelsea. He has been at fault for numerous goals since his arrival, including a nightmare performance at Anfield. Improvement needed. Getty Images 4/20 17. Giovani Lo Celso - 5/10 The Argentinian's hotly anticipated arrival in London has been blighted by a hip injury that's restricted him to 44 minutes in the Premier League. Getty Images 5/20 16. Joelinton - 5.5/10 When Rondon left St James Park last season, fans were worried they\u2019d struggle to replace him. Joelinton has only managed one goal in his last seven game, however, there have been promising flashes from the Brazilian. Getty Images 6/20 15. Raul Jimenez - 6/10 After last season\u2019s 13 goals and 10 assists, Jimenez will no doubt prove a valuable acquisition for Wolves. Just two goals so far this season means he has been underwhelming. Getty Images 7/20 14. Adam Webster - 6/10 Duffy had been a stalwart in Brighton\u2019 side. Youngster Webster has managed to breakthrough in his place. Barring a poor lapse in concentration against Chelsea he has been solid. PA 8/20 13. Nicolas Pepe - 6/10 The \u00a372m winger is still adjusting to English football and has yet to recapture his goalscoring form at Lille. However, the signs of his quality are obvious for all to see. Getty Images 9/20 12. Sebastian Haller - 6.5/10 Haller started off slowly. But a brace at Watford set him on his way and he\u2019s now on three goals and one assist. If he can replicate his form from his time in Frankfurt, West Ham will be dangerous. Getty Images 10/20 11. Tyrone Mings - 6.5/10 Earned an England call-up through his performances, after making his loan spell permanent, but hasn't been able to totally sure up Villa's leaky defence. Aston Villa FC via Getty Images 11/20 10. Harry Maguire - 7/10 Has immediately improved United's defence since his impressive debut and adds leadership to a currently wildly inconsistent side. Getty Images 12/20 9. Moussa Djenepo - 7/10 Due to injury, Djenepo has only managed three appearances for Southampton. He has scored two goals though, and has brought pace and finishing ability reminiscent of Sadio Mane\u2019s time on the south coast. Action Images via Reuters 13/20 8. Aaron Wan-Bissaka - 7/10 With the most tackles in the league, Wan- Bissaka has been solid. The only criticism for the young full back? Going forward he could improve. Getty Images 14/20 7. Gary Cahill - 7.5/10 Has added some invaluable know-how to Palace\u2019s defence. A win at Old Trafford on debut and two clean sheets since then. Good start for the Champions League winner. REUTERS 15/20 6. Harry Wilson - 7.5/10 On loan from Liverpool, the young Welshman has produced moments of quality, including a long range strike (albeit deflected) at Villa Park and a delightful free kick against the Champions. Getty Images 16/20 5. Dani Ceballos - 7.5/10 The Spaniard has been superb for the most part. He has been instrumental in Arsenal\u2019s midfield. If you want to be cynical, it would be nice to see more in the goals and assist columns. UEFA via Getty Images 17/20 4. Rodrigo - 7.5/10 Has integrated relatively seamlessly into Guardiola's starting eleven and already feels as though he has been part of City's set up for a long time. Action Images via Reuters 18/20 3. Tanguy Ndombele - 7.5/10 Arguably one of the most well rounded midfielders in Europe. It\u2019s early days at Spurs but Ndombele has added goals and security in midfield. Getty Images 19/20 2. Daniel James - 8/10 What a bargain \u00a315 million was. Three goals this season and one of few causes for optimism in an abject Man Utd side. Potentially signing of the season if he keeps it up. Plus, he has all the time in the world to develop at 21 years of age. Getty Images 20/20 1. Youri Tielemans - 8.5/10 Superb start from Tielemans since joining the Foxes on a permanent basis. He is level with De Bruyne for completed through balls and has been a huge help to Maddison. Getty Images 1/20 20.

It was not a good day, we didn\u2019t play good.\u201d\n\nCity now trail Liverpool by eight points in the two-headed race for the title, however, Guardiola insisted that there is still \u201ca long way to go\u201d and is certain his side will stage a comeback.\n\n\u201cI know these guys, they can still do it. It was a bad day, a bad game. Credit to the opponent. What\u2019s happened has happened...\n\n\u201cToday was the day we were not on our level. The previous games were good. The distance is big, Liverpool have not dropped points.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to come back. The results will dictate the situation, but we are in October and there\u2019s a long way to go.", "description": "Pep Guardiola admitted his Manchester City side suffered from nerves during their derailing 2-0 defeat at home to Wolves.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/06/18/Pep-Guardiola.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
