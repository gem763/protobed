The research also is a grim indicator of the overall health of the environment and reflects what may be occurring in other less closely observed animals, said Ken Rosenberg, a conservation scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who was the study\u2019s lead author.\n\n\u201cBirds are literally the canary in the coal mine,\u201d he said.\n\nThe loss was particularly profound for grassland birds\u2014which include more common species like sparrows and finches\u2014with its population falling 53%. The decline of these birds, known for their adaptability to human landscapes, in particular surprised researchers.\n\nRelated Stories Manhattan\u2019s Hawk Population Is Soaring\n\nSystematic Estimates of Bird Populations Prove Challenging\n\nFlying High: Research Unveils Birds\u2019 Learning Power\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t keep those populations healthy, then something\u2019s really wrong,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said. \u201cIt puts a punctuation mark on it.\u201d\n\nThe reasons for the decline are hard to pinpoint because there may be many and the causes differ from one species to another, researchers have said. \u201cThere is no Holy Grail,\u201d said Nicole Michel, senior quantitative ecologist at the National Audubon Society, a nonprofit conservation group.\n\nBut generally speaking, researchers attribute the decline to the broader impact of climate change, deforestation and shifts in agricultural practices. Habitat loss and the use of pesticides had an impact on grassland birds in North America and their decline, the study says.\n\nA sparrow perches in a tree in New York's Central Park.

But, before now, they didn\u2019t have the numbers to prove it.\n\nResearchers tracked population changes for 529 bird species\u2014or, about 76% of breeding species\u2014in the continental U.S. and Canada using data that spanned up to nearly five decades. Of those species, 419 experienced population loss, while 100 showed small increases. To track these birds, researchers used several bird-monitoring data sets and, separately, 143 weather radars used to track their migrations.\n\nWhen they first discovered the net population loss through this process, \u201cit took a lot of work from that point on to make sure we could justify our numbers,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said.\n\nThe findings in North America reflect similar declines in bird populations globally, like those of farmland birds in Europe, the study said.\n\nPopulations for waterfowl and raptors instead saw increases over this nearly 50-year-period, likely due to changes in policy in hunting and for insecticides like DDT, the study said. The National Audubon Society is calling for the implementation of restoration acts and environmental protections in an effort to see similar rebounds among the rest of these bird populations.\n\nNow, researchers are shifting their focus on the specifics: where, how and why these bird species are declining\u2014and what can be done about it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really waking up the research community,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Calfas at Jennifer.Calfas@wsj.com", "description": "North American\u2019s bird population has dropped by about 3 billion since 1970, says new study, a grim indicator of environmental health", "authors": ["Jennifer Calfas", "Jennifer.Calfas Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108892/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
