REUTERS/Michele Tantussi/File Photo\n\nGermany\u2019s oldest party is hovering in the polls just above the all-time lows it hit in June after its worst-ever performance in a European election prompted its leader to quit.\n\nSince then, the SPD has been embroiled in a leadership race culminating in a membership ballot. If, as many pollsters tip, no candidate wins more than 50% on Saturday, a run-off vote will take place with the outcome expected at the end of November.\n\nIn December, a party conference will approve the choice. The SPD will also decide whether to abandon the coalition, a move that would probably trigger a snap election or minority government, both unsavoury options for stability-loving Germans.\n\nTwelve candidates are running on joint tickets.\n\nThe highest profile, and probable frontrunner, is Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz - with a partner from the formerly communist east of Germany. But his commitment to Merkel\u2019s coalition limits his appeal among the rank and file.\n\nMany of the SPD\u2019s 426,000 members are fed up with their party propping up Merkel, who has led Europe\u2019s biggest economy for 14 years - 10 of which have been with the SPD.\n\nThey believe the party has slumped badly in the polls by conceding too much to Merkel\u2019s conservatives on core policy and must reinvent itself in opposition.\n\nELEPHANT IN ROOM\n\nPolitics analyst Frank Decker at Bonn University said the SPD\u2019s efforts to play down discussion of the coalition during the leadership contest, which involved 23 hustings across Germany, was futile.\n\n\u201cHow things continue with the grand coalition is a big issue with members and has been the elephant in the room in the leadership race,\u201d said Decker, adding opinion was divided but more members probably preferred to quit government than stay.\n\nBoth the SPD and Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) stand to lose in a snap election, while support for the Greens has more than doubled since the 2017 vote.\n\nTwo of the SPD candidate pairs clearly favour staying in government to push their agenda of social justice - Scholz and a duo led by Lower Saxony interior minister Boris Pistorius.\n\nTwo others pairs are clearly against it, including one led by Norbert Walter-Borjans, a little-known politician from Germany\u2019s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia. The other two duos, while on the SPD\u2019s left, are less explicit.\n\nMost commentators tip the centrist Scholz, not known for his charisma, to win most votes thanks to his government experience and track record of winning elections in the city of Hamburg.\n\n\u201cI am from Hamburg, passion there is sometimes more sober. But I would not have stood if I didn\u2019t have passion. It is the passion for a fair, just society that has led me into the SPD,\u201d Scholz said in an interview with T-Online on Wednesday.\n\nForsa pollster Manfred Guellner said Scholz was probably ahead but doubted he would win outright on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe danger for him then is that members against him will back one leftist opponent in a run-off vote,\u201d said Guellner.\n\nWhoever wins has a mountain to climb to revive the SPD.\n\nJust off all-time lows, the pro-European SPD is languishing in polls at around 14%, way below Merkel\u2019s conservatives, on around 27%, and the resurgent Greens, and only just ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).", "description": "Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) will on Saturday announce the result of a ballot for a new leader to guide them out of months of turmoil and, in effect, decide whether to ditch their unloved coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives.", "authors": ["Madeline Chambers", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444138766&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1BY", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
