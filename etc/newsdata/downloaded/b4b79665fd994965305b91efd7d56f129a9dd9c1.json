Probably the worst moment for her to spill her coffee, tbh\u2026\n\nShe captioned the shot: \u2018Mornings at home.\u2019\n\nDon\u2019t spill the coffee! (Picture: @emrata)\n\nEveryone was getting into the spirit (Picture: @emrata)\n\nNot the kind of mornings at our home. We WISH we were this chilled about the upholstery.\n\nNaked caffeine wasn\u2019t the only thing running in the Ratajkowski household, as the 28-year-old hung out with her husband Sebastian Bear-McClard, 32, and their adorable dog.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeems the model, designer and actress was keen to shed her clothes after revealing on Instagram she\u2019d been wearing the same trackpants suit for 24 hours after travelling back to their swanky manor.\n\nWe can totally relate. Mind you, those tracksuits probably cost more than our most glamorous outfit\u2026\n\nEmily with husband Sebastian (Picture: Invision)\n\nThe star is often praised for unapologetically living her best life and getting her kit off as she sees fit.\n\nHear hear!\n\nEarlier this year she admitted she used to be \u2018ashamed\u2019 of her body, after hitting puberty a little earlier than her schoolmates.\n\nNow? It\u2019s evident she DGAF what people think and proudly does her thing.\n\nIncluding naked Mondays.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really about body positivity, for me I grew up and I developed super young. I was criticised at 13,\u2019 she explained in June.\n\n\u2018I felt really ashamed of my body but I\u2019ve come full circle, and now I\u2019m like, \u201cDo your thing!\u201d I really want young girls to see that and feel that way about themselves.\u2019\n\nKnowing her nekkid posts garner a whole lot of attention, negative and positive, Emily previously shared her thoughts on having inner confidence alongside Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nShe explained: \u2018[When I post nude pictures on Instagram] the initial reaction is, \u201cOh my god, naked again\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s so stupid\u201d and \u201cDo you have nothing else to offer?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But actually, I\u2019m running a business out of this.
