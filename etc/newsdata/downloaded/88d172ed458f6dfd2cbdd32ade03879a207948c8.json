Among its predecessors is Hunch, a company that delivered customized recommendations to users based on signals around the web (and sold to eBay in 2011). Another variation on the same theme can be traced back to the dot com era company Keen.com, a live answer community where people could get answers to their questions over the phone.\n\nStill, Curated makes enough sense in today\u2019s market that Forerunner Ventures, which has established a name for itself as the preeminent investor in e-commerce companies, just led its $22 million Series A round. It was the only venture firm in the round by design, says cofounder and CEO Eddie Vivas, who says the funding was filled out by the same friends and family who\u2019d participated in Curated\u2019s $5.5 million seed round.\n\nAs part of the deal, Forerunner founder Kirsten Green has also joined the board.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to appreciate the company\u2019s appeal. Curated works by matching bewildered shoppers with people who are passionate and knowledgeable and \u201cexpert\u201d in their fields. Right now, those experts are mostly athletes or coaches, as the platform is starting out with a handful of verticals, including golf, cycling, and a few winter sports. Longer term, the idea is to launch new sections on the site every six to eight weeks, including fly fishing, kiteboarding, camping and hiking.\n\nHow the economics work: Curated strikes deals with manufacturers \u2014 say makers of snowboard equipment or mountain bikes \u2014 that sell Curated their goods at wholesale prices. Curated can then sell them at retail prices to its customers. (Curated fulfills the order itself.)\n\nPart of that markup is used to pay its experts, who tend to be people who have jobs in related fields but could use more income and who love sharing what they know about a topic. To ensure that these experts know as much as they claim, they are vetted by other experts on the platform, answering a battery of questions as part of that process.\n\nVivas stresses that experts are in no way incentivized to recommend anything in particular to a customer, but he says customers can tip the experts if they wish. (Curated suggests tips of 5%, 7.5%, or 10%, and Vivas says they are sometimes given much more than that by shoppers who are thankful for their time and effort, especially when their interactions end up leading them to products that cost less than they might have paid otherwise.)\n\nThe end goal is for customers to complete transactions on the platform that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise feel comfortable completing at a site where they aren\u2019t actively educated.\n\nThe platform is seizing on a number of trends that make it a smart idea for this day and age. For one thing, it uses artificial intelligence to connect shoppers with the right advisors. Though everyone tosses around AI as a competitive advantage, Curated seemingly has a genuine competitive advantage on this front, owing to the background of Vivas, who sold to LinkedIn an earlier company that used AI to automate the recruiting process.\n\nAt the time, in 2014, it was LinkedIn\u2019s biggest acquisition ever. And Vivas stayed at LinkedIn for another 3.5 years as the head of product within its talent solutions business, which is where LinkedIn derives most of its revenue. (In fact, it\u2019s where he met some of the 32 people who now work at Curated.)\n\nCurated is also putting to work far-flung knowledge workers who, like a lot of Americans, increasingly work for themselves or in part-time roles that they\u2019re looking to supplement with other part-time roles.\n\nBut perhaps most meaningfully, Curated is a kind of antidote to Amazon, where shoppers can turn when they need something fast but that\u2019s incredibly limited when it comes to providing the kind of information needed to comfortably make big purchases. Consumers may pull the trigger on items anyway, but often, they end up with merchandise that they then have to send back or never wind up using.\n\nThe question now is whether the company can scale. To do so, it\u2019ll need to rise above the din of other e-commerce platforms to attract enough customers to support its network of experts (and vice versa), and it\u2019s a pretty crowded landscape out there, even with the magic of search-engine optimization and Facebook ads.\n\nCurated will also need to strike enough deals with goods manufacturers to make the platform compelling for shoppers, and to ensure that the level of the advice that\u2019s provided to those consumers is, and remains, high.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Vivas doesn\u2019t sound concerned. He thinks he\u2019s built a strong team. He\u2019s also excited about the growing network of experts the team has pieced together since founding the company in the summer of 2017.\n\n\u201cYou take someone who is passionate about something and you let them make money off it, and good things happen,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIn allowing people to monetize their knowledge, the unlock is just unbelievable.\u201d\n\nTime will tell.
