(Getty Images)\n\nIsrael Adesanya completed the quickest rise to stardom in modern UFC history on Saturday, knocking out Robert Whittaker with a two-punch combination in the second round in their unification bout at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, Australia, to become the undisputed middleweight champion in the main event of UFC 243.\n\nIn his seventh UFC fight, which have come in the last 20 months, Adesanya established himself as one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars with a devastating knockout of Whittaker.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhittaker was trying to leap in and land a shot throughout the fight to counteract Adesanya\u2019s height and reach advantage. Adesanya stayed cool and slipped out of punching range and consistently caught Whittaker.\n\nHe dropped Whittaker with a second left in the first round, and it seemed as if Whittaker were saved by the bell. But there was no saving him in the second round, as Adesanya not only showed good boxing skills but the power to go with it.\n\nWhittaker threw a hook and Adesanya ducked out of the way and landed a right hand that wobbled Whittaker. He came back with a left that dropped Whittaker and quickly finished it.\n\nIt was only a month shy of four years ago when Adesanya sat in the stands in the same venue and watched Holly Holm upset Ronda Rousey at UFC 193 in 2015. Adesanya imagined himself making the walkouts and hearing the crowd that night as a way to prepare for when he\u2019d fight for the belt himself.\n\nHe made that memory come true on Saturday with a magnificent performance.\n\n\u201c[In 2015], I was in the nose bleeds, and now I made his nose bleed,\u201d Adesanya said.\n\nWhittaker had questioned Adesanya\u2019s toughness before the fight and said Adesanya didn\u2019t like to get hit. Whittaker vowed he\u2019d put hands on Adesanya and it\u2019d be a different outcome than it had been previously.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdesanya, though, showed the chin that got him through a difficult outing with Kelvin Gastelum to win the interim title at UFC 236 in April.\n\n\u201cThat was a nice one he caught me with, but look at the return,\u201d Adesanya said in the Octagon as he watched a replay of the finish. \u201cI eat it and I give it back in return, two times. That\u2019s a two-piece right there. \u2026 I can take it and I can give it back. I don\u2019t like to get hit. He\u2019s right. It\u2019s stupid to get hit. I\u2019m not that dumb.\u201d\n\nWhittaker, who had to pull out of a fight in February because he underwent emergency surgery after the weigh-in for UFC 234, was fighting for the first time since a victory over Yoel Romero 16 months ago.\n\nHe was never really able to get on track.\n\n\u201cI thought I was doing pretty well until I got caught,\u201d Whittaker said.\n\nTo this point, Adesanya seems to catch them all. He\u2019s 18-0 with 14 knockouts overall and 7-0 with three KOs in the UFC.\n\nHe called out unbeaten Paola Costa for his first title defense.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "In his seventh UFC fight, which have come in the last 20 months, Adesanya established himself as one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars with a devastating knockout of Whittaker.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4C2SUaThgwcjKX0oSPC.KA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MTcuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4EeogUMw4_CpqEf6DoAF7g--~B/aD0yMTMzO3c9MzM0MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/6150cd80-e7f5-11e9-97dd-844c4420de1c", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
