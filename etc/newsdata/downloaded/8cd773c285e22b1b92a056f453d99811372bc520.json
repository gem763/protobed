Pro-Trump Teens Forced to Paint Over 'Keep America Great' Signs", "language": "en", "text": "The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com.\n\nThere\u2019s a long-standing tradition at many high schools across the fruited plain \u2013 when you become a senior you get to paint your parking spot.\n\nThis year that tradition is causing big problems, especially for teenage supporters of President Trump.\n\nAt Calhoun High School in Texas a teenage boy had decorated his parking spot with a painting of a John Deere tractor along with the words \u201cTrump 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy son was called into the principal\u2019s office and told to paint over the Trump 2020 on his spot,\u201d Krystal Stringham told ToddStarnes.com. \u201cHe asked the principal why, and was told it was against school policy and that they had received an email from the district office.\u201d\n\nMrs. Stringham provided me with video of a school worker painting over the parking spot. Click here to watch the video.\n\nMrs. Stringham\u2019s other son is captain of the cheer squad. He was part of a group of students who posed with a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d banner during homecoming spirit week.\n\nOne of the high school cheerleading coaches posted the innocent photo on Facebook leading to all sorts of outrage. The teacher was forced to take down the image.\n\nThe Victoria Advocate reports the photograph violated \u201cpolicies regarding political neutrality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe entire situation is unacceptable,\u201d Mrs. Stringham told ToddStarnes.com. \u201cWhat happened to freedom of speech or press?\u201d\n\nShe disputed any notion that the teachers were trying to sway the political viewpoints of the students.\n\n\u201cThe kids have formed their own opinion and have now been shown they can\u2019t express their opinion,\u201d Mrs. Stringham said.\n\nMeanwhile at West Virginia\u2019s Valley High School three students were ordered to paint over their parking spots because they wrote, \u201cKeep America Great.\u201d\n\nThe school district said the original painting violated a policy regarding political signs on school property.\n\nSupt. Ed Toman released a statement to television station WOWK:\n\n\u201cAdministration is not attempting to impede on any student\u2019s freedom of expression or political views. Students have such rights as initially determined years ago by the US Supreme Court. However, neither students nor employees are permitted to utilize board owned property (including the parking spaces at issue here) to promote partisan politics. That is not a proper or legal use of educational property.\u201d\n\nOver the past few months I have documented students across the nation who have faced attacks because they are underage deplorables. This sort of anti-Trump censorship is flat-out unconstitutional.\n\nContrary to what leftist administrators might say, Trump supporters do not have to leave their political beliefs at the schoolhouse door.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Sign up for a free subscription to Todd\u2019s weekly newsletter: a must read for Conservatives and people of faith!
