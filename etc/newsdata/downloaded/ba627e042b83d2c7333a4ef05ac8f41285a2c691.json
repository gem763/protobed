We will use whatever mechanism is necessary to achieve that.\u201d\n\nLabour is wary of calling a vote of no confidence in the PM until it is absolutely sure that Britain will not crash out of the EU during the election campaign it would trigger. And ministers have not yet ruled out requesting a second prorogation to run down the clock to Brexit day, which the Queen would by convention be expected to grant.\n\nBoth Labour and Lib Dems are expected to oppose any Conservative motion for an immediate short recess to allow them to hold the party\u2019s annual conference, due to start in Manchester on Sunday.\n\nIf Mr Johnson fails to win the support of enough independent MPs \u2013 including those who he expelled from the party for rebelling \u2013 to secure the recess, the conference may have to be cut short or take place with the bulk of his MPs in parliament. The early resumption of Commons sittings means that his next appearance at prime minister\u2019s questions could come next Wednesday, on the scheduled date of his first address to the conference as Conservative leader.", "description": "Boris Johnson flies back to Westminster facing calls for his resignation and an early election, after a historic Supreme Court ruling plunged his Brexit plans into disarray and his premiership into its deepest crisis yet.
