When Jon Rudnitsky was brought aboard in 2015, he was castigated for several ugly tweets in his past; while he weathered that storm, he only lasted a year on the show and largely as a background extra. Melissa Villase\u00f1or was similarly criticized for offensive jokes in her Twitter history, many of which she deleted; she later called the posts a failed attempt to be edgy. In both cases, the SNL producer and creator, Lorne Michaels, silently waited out the online blowback. But Gillis\u2019s case will be harder to ignore.\n\nMegh Wright of Vulture has already extensively reported on Gillis\u2019s history of lazily offensive comedy, most of it from podcast episodes as recent as 2018. A subreddit devoted to his podcast (which has already been locked from public viewing) is reportedly \u201cfilled with homophobic slurs,\u201d while one Philadelphia comedy-theater owner told Wright she had banned Gillis \u201cbecause of racist, homophobic, and sexist things he\u2019s said on and offstage.\u201d After years in the Philadelphia scene, Gillis moved to New York and was this year named one of the \u201cnew faces\u201d at Montreal\u2019s Just for Laughs festival, a crucial showcase for up-and-coming comedy talent.\n\nGillis\u2019s stand-up routines are, of course, far more polished than the podcast excerpts. One Comedy Central clip is about how white people like country music because \u201cyou can understand all the lyrics\u201d; Gillis later mocks the assumption that he\u2019d be a Trump voter (while saying he didn\u2019t actually vote for Donald Trump). Watching Gillis onstage, it\u2019s clear what might have appealed to Michaels and to SNL head writers Colin Jost and Michael Che; the latter, especially, is fond of prodding \u201cliberal kids [in] coastal cities\u201d and might have been drawn to Gillis\u2019s more \u201cred state\u201d mentality.\n\nGillis\u2019s defense that he\u2019s simply taking \u201crisks\u201d in the name of a good laugh is euphemistic and disingenuous at best. There are plenty of provocative comedians who do not have a bad-enough reputation to get banned from stand-up clubs, or episodes of podcasts dedicated to ranking which races are best at comedy. Aside from the racist remarks, what stands out most from this particular episode of Matt and Shane\u2019s Secret Podcast is a sense of resentment as the two hosts discuss their hatred of successful comics like Chris Gethard and Hasan Minhaj, and criticize a Rolling Stone list of comics to watch that doesn\u2019t include any straight white men.\n\nBackbiting in the comedy scene isn\u2019t a rare phenomenon, but Gillis\u2019s grousing underlines just how little respect he has for any diversity of voices in a medium whose purported values he\u2019s invoking to defend himself. His tweeted statement suggests anything terrible he might have said was all to help develop his craft, and yet his conception of that craft is frustratingly narrow. Decades after its debut, Saturday Night Live remains a career pinnacle that so many comedy professionals aspire to; the question now is whether Michaels and NBC will reflect on what it would mean for working and aspiring comics if the show included Gillis in the cast.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
