The White House has since tapped a number of federal spending accounts meant for disaster recovery and military construction projects, diverting that funding to his wall.\n\nLater Wednesday, Trump again dismissed the report while addressing reporters in the Oval Office, pleading ignorance and falsely claiming the forthcoming book had been written by reporters from The Washington Post.\n\nHe claimed that the first he'd heard of the notion was when his communications staff came to ask him about the allegations in the report, including the moat proposal. \"Whatever that is, it's not a word I use but they used it,\" he said.\n\nReenacting the moment he was asked about it, Trump told reporters he asked his staff why they were asking \"that stupid question\" about whether he wanted a moat, launching into a tirade about the Post.\n\n\"I said, obviously it's fake, because almost everything The Washington Post does is fake,\" he claimed, adding later: \"Never said it, never thought of it.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/56/d4/2002ee244224a479b1d1e9d07de1/19102-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg"}
