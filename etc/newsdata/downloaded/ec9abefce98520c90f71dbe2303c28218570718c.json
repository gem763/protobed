LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Eventually there will be Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, plus Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.\n\nThe NBA is stacked with elite duos that are NBA contenders, and figuring out which twosome will fit best together has become part of making a prediction for who will win the NBA title.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nKobe Bryant was asked that in an interview by ESPN and he went another direction (hat tip Hoop Rumors).\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I think it matters what they put around those two guys, and then what is the offensive and defensive system they\u2019re going to be executing. You could have marquee names and put those marquee names together, and guess if they could play together or not, but it ultimately comes down to what system do you have them in and how does that affect the rest of the guys.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right. The Warriors had a big three but do they win without Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, solid bigs, and everyone there buying into Steve Kerr\u2019s system? LeBron and Irving in Cleveland needed Kevin Love and J.R. Smith (pre-meltdown mistake) to win in 2016. The big three of LeBron/Dwyane Wade/Chris Bosh had Ray Allen and other guys to hit big shots, plus they lost before they all bought into Eric Spoelstra\u2019s system. The Spurs won five rings with Tim Duncan/Tony Parker/Manu Ginobili but always were the ultimate system team under Gregg Popovich.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s why a lot of pundits lean toward the Clippers when looking at the coming season \u2014 this was a 48-win, hard-to-play-against team well coached by Doc Rivers last season before Leonard and George showed up. But, will the Clippers be the same team and play with the same passion this season? Do the Lakers have the guard play needed to contend, and can Frank Vogel get them on the same page (can he keep his job)? Do the Rockets have the depth after their starting five? Will any of those teams fully buy into the coach\u2019s system?\n\nWhat makes this NBA season so fascinating and wide open is that every team has plenty of questions, there is no juggernaut. But next June, we may be talking less about the best duo and more about what Kobe said \u2014 which supporting cast and system worked best?", "description": "\"But it ultimately comes down to what system do you have them in and how does that affect the rest of the guys.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/M2ibUhzrLTBESWjDFuWyCw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNjg7aD02MDI-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sItCX0nJWVIzgaZkPk4CNw--~B/aD0zMDE7dz01MzQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/78150aaa4b48abdb0cfb9f00d79a4b37", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
