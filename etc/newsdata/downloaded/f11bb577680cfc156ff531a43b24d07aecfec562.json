Not always, of course; happily, irony still exists. Yet insincere sharing or retweeting is not the norm \u2014 as evidenced by the fact that most people feel obligated to signal that retweets aren\u2019t endorsements. That wouldn\u2019t make sense if the default wasn\u2019t that shares and retweets are endorsements.\n\nBut what if we are just confused about the way communication actually functions online? Clues can be found in both what we do and don\u2019t do when sharing content online.\n\nLet\u2019s start with what we don\u2019t do. Current research estimates that at least 60 percent of news stories shared online have not even been read by the person sharing them. As an author of one study summed up the matter, \u201cPeople are more willing to share an article than read it.\u201d On the other hand, what we do is share content that gets people riled up. Research has found that the best predictor of sharing is strong emotions \u2014 both emotions like affection (think posts about cute kittens) and emotions like moral outrage. Studies suggest that morally laden emotions are particularly effective: every moral sentiment in a tweet increases by 20 percent its chances of being shared. And social media may just pump up our feelings. Acts that don\u2019t elicit as much outrage offline, for example, elicit more online, perhaps because the social benefits of outrage still exist without the normal risks.\n\nThis should tell us that conveying knowledge isn\u2019t the primary reason news stories are shared. As the influential contemporary philosopher Ruth Millikan puts it, the stabilizing function of a communicative act is whatever explains why that act continues to persist. The stabilizing function of yelling \u201cAir ball!\u201d at a basketball player trying to make a free throw is to distract him. It may do other things too \u2014 amuse people, or even describe what, in fact, turns out to be an air ball. But the reason people continue to yell \u201cAir ball!\u201d it is that it is distracting. Someone new to the game could conceivably get this backward. They might think that people are warning the player or predicting how the shot is going to fall. Such interpretations would be a misunderstanding the act\u2019s stabilizing function.\n\nSomething like this is happening on a massive scale on social media. We are like the person just described, new to the game of basketball. We think we are sharing news stories in order to do one thing, like transfer knowledge, but much of the time aren\u2019t really trying to do that at all \u2014 whatever we may consciously think. If we were, we would presumably have read the piece that we\u2019re sharing. But most of us don\u2019t. So, what are we doing?", "description": "We think we are sharing facts, but we are really expressing emotions in the outrage factory.", "authors": ["Michael P.
