(Jeanette Chabalala,News24)\n\nJohannesburg \u2013 The scene where two female JMPD officers were killed was scattered with debris from the multiple vehicle collision.\n\nTheir families sat on the side of the road, tears streaming down their faces, during a wreath-laying ceremony, where the accident happened in Witkoppen Road in Fourways, Johannesburg on Thursday morning.\n\nAlinah Ngoasheng and Winnie Rakgolo met their untimely death on Monday when an alleged drunk driver drove into them and a group of officers, causing a multiple vehicle crash at a roadside checkpoint there.\n\nThe two officers were declared dead at the scene by Netcare 911 paramedics.\n\nDuring the ceremony, mourners broke down as they laid down flowers and some battled to stand.\n\n\"We are really distraught,\" Ngoasheng's husband, Andrew Damari, said.\n\n\"They [their sons] are left without a mother because of someone who [was] irresponsible on our roads.\n\n\"The boys are devastated - they no longer have a mother from now on. So, I am going to wear two caps \u2013 be a mother and a father to them,\" Damari said.\n\n'Everything to her kids'\n\nNgoasheng is survived by her husband and two sons aged 17 and 12.\n\nMeanwhile, Rakgolo's aunt Gloria Rakgolo said they lost a breadwinner.\n\n\"It is really tough for us. The kids are really going through a bad time at this stage.\n\nThey already went to counselling.\n\nRakgolo is survived by her three children aged 19, 16 and five.\n\n\"She was everything to her kids. I last saw her in December in Polokwane. She was kind and caring,\" she said, as she battled to hold back her tears.\n\nNews24 previously reported that two passengers and a driver in a separate car were seriously injured when the driver of the Toyota Hilux double cab bakkie drove into the group of officers, as well as a Hyundai.\n\nTwo other female officers, as well as the drivers of a BMW and Porsche \u2013 which had been stopped by the officers \u2013 were slightly injured.\n\nWhen the news broke, JMPD chief David Tembe said he was at a loss for words over the deaths of the officers.\n\n'Be strong'\n\nAfter the wreath laying ceremony, families and officials went to the JPMD academy in Johannesburg for the formal memorial service.\n\nDuring the memorial, Tembe also took the opportunity to comfort the families.\n\nAddressing different families, he said: \"To the family of Ngoasheng, we are sorry. Perhaps there is something that went wrong on that particular day.\n\n\"To the family of Mokgolo, be strong. Your daughter has served the city of Johannesburg with pride and dignity.\"\n\nMayor Herman Mashaba also paid tribute to the slain JMPD officers.\n\n\"My heart like yours, is filled with sorrow,\" he told those in attendance at JMPD academy in Johannesburg.\n\nMashaba said, when he received the news, he could not help but feel a deep sense of shock.\n\n\"Let me not mince my words. This was murder. A drunk driver with no regards of the lives of others with no regard for the law took the lives of these women. This was murder. I believe each of us are justified in anger towards this criminal,\" he said.", "description": "The families of two female JMPD officers, killed in a collision earlier this week, hold a wreath-lying ceremony for them", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7008/5bded4e3aa884afe8cd1995382b9b3ae.jpg", "published_at": "2018-02-01"}
