In fact, he shared a wide range of reasons for the inevitable undoing including: funding stresses, unprofitable companies selling at nosebleed valuations, structural imbalances, excess debt, and \"asinine monetary policy.\"\n\n\"All the makings of a crash are there,\" he mused.\n\nBut at the heart of the matter lies what he views of the real culprit underlying it all: the Federal Reserve. He thinks their loose monetary policies have resulted in an unsustainable environment.\n\n\"When you push liquidity through the system like they have the last ten years, you create a giant bubble,\" he relayed.\n\nRead more: The man who wrote the book on how to make 100 times your money with a single stock outlines the core principles of his investing approach \u2014 and shares his 2 top under-the-radar picks\n\nAnd he's just getting warmed up. To Kupperman, the Fed's actions have created a \"Ponzi sector.\"\n\n\"Ponzi stocks are things like WeWork or Tesla or other blatant frauds,\" he said. \"The Ponzi sector being all the companies that have no chance of ever earning a profit, yet they continue to grow revenue.\"\n\nThose are harsh words for investors who own a piece of these companies. But don't be so quick to dismiss his perspectives. Neither of these firms are anywhere close to turning a profit, and the former has experienced a CEO change, a failed IPO, and roughly a $40 billion cut to its valuation in the last six weeks.\n\n\"These things literally have no economic rationale to exist expect for the fact that liquidity has been pushed through the system, and people keep buying shares because they believe that there's some other sucker who's even dumber than they are,\" Kupperman said.\n\nAgainst that gloomy backdrop, Kupperman says he's looking for sectors that are widely hated and undervalued. He's built his success by going against the grain and waiting for an inflection point.\n\nSome of his favorite plays today are: shipping, energy, uranium, and the Greek economy \u2014 places a conventional investor wouldn't dream of touching in today's market environment.\n\nIf you agree with his thinking, an investor looking for broad exposure to these ideas could purchase:\n\nNow read: A self-taught hedge fund manager who's returned 19%-plus annually to investors since 2012 shares the 3 books that 'put it all together' for him", "description": "\"I've been through 2 crashes in my life, and I think this is the third one,\" said Harris Kupperman, the president of Praetorian Capital Management.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d975570591bb70c645d9623?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
