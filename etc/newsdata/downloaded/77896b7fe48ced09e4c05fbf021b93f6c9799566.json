Mack was also found guilty of racketeering conspiracy, assault, and narcotics conspiracy. They were acquitted on other charges.\n\nDuring Tekashi\u2019s three-day testimony, the rapper, who\u2019s known for his hyper-aggressive persona and rainbow hair, was visibly nervous as he told jurors he was first introduced Mack and Ellison\u2019s gang\u2014the Nine Trey Bloods\u2014while taping a music video in 2017 for his first hit single, \u201cGUMMO.\u201d\n\nWhen the video went viral, Tekashi said he developed a symbiotic relationship with the gang: They provided protection as his fame grew, and he provided a revenue stream for their illicit activities.\n\n\u201cI got the street credibility. I would say I got my career,\u201d the hip-hop star testified last week. \u201cI knew I had a winning formula for my music videos: repeat the gang image. That\u2019s what people liked.\u201d\n\nThe rapper, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, first became a viral social media star in 2014 with unabashedly raunchy Instagram and Youtube videos that often featured guns, drugs, and various references to the Nine Trey Bloods. The Brooklyn-born rapper, who hit the mainstream music scene two years later, is best known for his hit single last year with Nicki Minaj, \u201cFEFE.\u201d\n\nTekashi was arrested last November along with 11 other Nine Trey Bloods members and pleaded guilty in February to nine federal charges, including firearms offenses, racketeering, and drug counts. (The rapper also previously pleaded guilty in 2015 to child porn charges after filming a sexually explicit video with a 13-year-old girl\u2014a video he once said was intended to boost his \u201cscumbag\u201d persona.)\n\nAs part of the deal with prosecutors, Tekashi agreed to take the stand against Nine Trey Bloods members who opted for a trial, name-dropping famous rappers and alleged gang members, including Bronx natives Cardi B and Jim Jones. The decision to testify was heavily criticized by several of his music peers\u2014including Snoop Dogg and 50 Cent.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Rebold described Ellison as the \u201cmuscle and manager\u201d for Tekashi until he was ousted from the rapper\u2019s inner circle in July 2018\u2014a move that allegedly prompted Ellison to kidnap and rob Tekashi for revenge. While Tekashi and Mack were not as close, prosecutors showed jurors several photos of the two at New York City clubs and concerts.\n\nTekashi testified that Ellison first showed his loyalty during an orchestrated attack on rival rapper Trippie Redd at the Gansevoort hotel in Manhattan last year. After months of \u201congoing disputes,\u201d multiple diss tracks, and \u201ca lot of jealousy\u201d with Redd, Tekashi said he ordered several Nine Trey members to \u201cget something done.\u201d\n\nThe rapper said while he waited in a car around the corner, a Nine Trey quartet stormed Redd\u2019s hotel room\u2014fleeing after Ellison punched Redd in the mouth without warning. The attack, Tekashi said, instantly earned Ellison the rapper\u2019s trust\u2014and access to his bank account.\n\n\u201cAfter the incident with Trippie Redd, [Ellison] and I got super close,\u201d Tekashi said. \u201cI used him as an enforcer, for protection. He became a part of my entourage.\u201d\n\nThe relationship, however, fizzled after \u201cabout four months\u201d when Ellison started to exhibit \u201caggressive behavior\u201d Tekashi said.\n\n\u201cStop picking and choosing when you wanna be gangster,\u201d Ellison texted Tekashi, according to messages shown in court.\n\nThe rapper testified that by July 2018, the Nine Treys were consumed by infighting, and the gang had split into supporters and enemies of Tekashi.\n\n\u201cWe were all part of the same gang, but we were all attacking each other at the same time,\u201d he said.\n\nTekashi alleged the animosity between the two erupted later that month, when Ellison allegedly kidnapped him the night before he dropped his single \u201cFEFE.\u201d Video from Tekashi\u2019s driver\u2019s dash-cam played in court last week showed Tekashi pleading with Ellison to spare him, before reminding him: \u201cI\u2019ve always done right by you.\u201d\n\nEllison and another assailant, he said, beat him up before taking more than $300,000 in jewelry\u2014including a diamond pony necklace with rainbow hair that resembled his own and a spinning \u201c69\u201d chain.\n\n\u201cI was so humiliated,\u201d Tekashi said as he fiddled with the Dutch braid pigtails he wore everyday in court. \u201cHumiliated because I constantly brag that I am untouchable and invincible on Instagram. Then I get kidnapped by a brother.\u201d\n\nThe rapper\u2019s symbiotic relationship with the Nine Treys disintegrated shortly after the July robbery when he denounced the Brooklyn-based crew on the radio, calling them \u201cfrauds\u201d and \u201cdirty Blood members.\u201d\n\nWeeks later, a dozen alleged members were arrested, and the next day, Tekashi said he decided to cooperate with the feds to \u201cshed light on the whole operation.\u201d He now faces a minimum of 47 years in prison at his December sentencing.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in New York has indicated that while he may receive far less because of his cooperation, he could enter witness protection program after serving his sentence\u2014though it is not immediately clear if Tekashi has accepted the offer.", "description": "One of the Nine Trey Blood members was accused of kidnapping Tekashi last July and stealing his jewelry, including a diamond necklace of a pony with rainbow hair.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2295,w_4080,x_0,y_226/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570035571/GettyImages-1054810008_ze4mqn"}
