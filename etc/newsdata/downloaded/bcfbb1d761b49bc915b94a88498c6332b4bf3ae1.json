But I\u2019ve spoken to the police and some of the most harrowing experiences have been where women are completely isolated, in a wealthy house on a hill.'\n\nMs Duffield added that the abuse she suffered had not been physical, his temper 'was so bad on the phone' it would leave her too frightened to return home at night.\n\n'When they ask you out they don\u2019t present their rage and they don\u2019t tell you that they like the idea of strong, independent, successful women, but not the reality,' she said in a stirring address to the Commons.\n\nMs Duffield was a single mother of two sons when she met the man she would later fear, but at first said he would treat her regularly with gifts of jewelery, romantic walks and kept a protective attitude.\n\n'They don\u2019t threaten, criticise, control, yell or exert their physical strength in increasingly frightening ways. Not yet. Not at the start.\u2019\n\n'Every day is emotionally exhausting, working in a job that you love but putting on a brave face and pretending all is good, fine, wonderful in fact,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018Then the pretence and the public face start to drop completely. Being yelled at in the car with the windows down, no attempt to hide behaviour during constituency engagements. Humiliation and embarrassment now added to permanent trepidation and constant hurt.\u2019\n\nThe emotional intervention came as MPs debated the Domestic Abuse Bill, which has been championed by Theresa May.\n\nMs Duffield recalled how, while living in a flat that overlooked the Commons from which you could her office window, he would call and say he could the lights were still on, asking 'shall I come and get you?'.\n\nRosie Duffield silenced Parliamentary colleagues when she recalled her own harrowing story of how a 'coercive' partner left her 'emotionally exhausted'\n\nAfter one blazing row over a sofa that went on into the early hours, Ms Duffield realised she needed to escape from the relationship.\n\nShe recalled taking the keys out of her partners pocket as he went to the gym before locking him out of their flat and begging the estate agent not to give him a spare set of keys.\n\nAfter delivering a tirade of abuse, the partner vanished, and has not returned in 10 months.\n\nFormer Labour leader Harriet Harman paid tribute to Ms Duffield during the Commons debate.\n\n\u2018I too would like to pay tribute to my honourable friend, the member for Canterbury, because what she said just now will save lives. So we are incredibly proud of her today, and she should be incredibly proud of herself,' she said.\n\nDuring the debate, former Prime Minister Theresa May gave her first speech since becoming a backbencher, telling MPs the Bill was a 'landmark piece of legislation' but only 'the first step'.\n\n'Domestic abuse blights lives, it can destroy lives, and not just the life of the immediate victim, but of those children and other family members as well,' she said.\n\nThere are around two million victims of domestic abuse a year, and one in ten of all offences recorded by police are related to domestic abuse, according to Home Office figures.", "description": "Canterbury MP Rosie Duffield, 48, has insisted that domestic abuse is not just a 'working class problem' after revealing that she has been a victim herself in an emotional Commons speech.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/10/19916764-0-image-a-18_1571477687728.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
