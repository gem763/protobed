I hate Trump. In America, I supported Hillary Clinton and Obama \u2013 I\u2019m as liberal as they come. I just don\u2019t really like the really far, far, far left politics where everything is free.\n\n\u2018You need a balance to lead a country \u2013 good on LGBT rights but good on keeping the country safe, keeping the military and all that.\u2019\n\nBaga was never a fan of Corbyn, but after meeting the Labour leader at the Pink News Awards, she may have changed her mind.\n\nBaga is one of the frontrunners on Drag Race UK (Picture: BBC/ Leigh Keily / Matt Burlem)\n\nShe said: \u2018I love the Queen, and I don\u2019t think Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s a fan of the Queen.\u2019\n\n\u2018But I feel really bad, I\u2019ve met Jeremy now and he\u2019s a lovely man,\u2019 she laughed. \u2018I\u2019m now a Corbynista!\u2019\n\nAfter the event, Baga tweeted: \u2018I love this guy and I will vote for him in the next general election so kiss my fatty ass!!!!\u2019 \u2013 so it looks like Corbyn has bagged a new celebrity fan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drag queen also spoke about transgender rights, following the news that transgender hate crimes have risen in the UK by 37% over the past year.\n\nBaga said: \u2018I take my hat off to [the trans community]. They have to deal with so much crap and people shouldn\u2019t be judged for who they want to be. And it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business. Like my mum and my nan would say, if it don\u2019t affect you, bugger off.\u2019\n\nAlongside Baga in RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, Crystal, The Vivienne, Blu Hydrangea, Vinegar Strokes, Cheryl Hole, Sum Ting Wong and Divina De Campo are competing to be crowned the UK\u2019s next drag superstar.\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK is on Thursdays at 8pm on BBC Three.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
