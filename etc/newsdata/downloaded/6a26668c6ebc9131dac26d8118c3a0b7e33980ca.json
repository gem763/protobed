Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nWith Setco Automotive yielding 6.7% and having paid a dividend for over 10 years, many investors likely find the company quite interesting. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Setco Automotive for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Setco Automotive!\n\nNSEI:SETCO Historical Dividend Yield, October 29th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 428% of Setco Automotive's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A payout ratio above 100% is definitely an item of concern, unless there are some other circumstances that would justify it.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Setco Automotive paid out 14% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservative and suggests the dividend is sustainable. It's disappointing to see that the dividend was not covered by profits, but cash is more important from a dividend sustainability perspective, and Setco Automotive fortunately did generate enough cash to fund its dividend. Still, if the company repeatedly paid a dividend greater than its profits, we'd be concerned. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings.\n\nIs Setco Automotive's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Setco Automotive's dividend was not well covered by earnings, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). Setco Automotive is carrying net debt of 4.12 times its EBITDA, which is getting towards the upper limit of our comfort range on a dividend stock that the investor hopes will endure a wide range of economic circumstances.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. With EBIT of 1.22 times its interest expense, Setco Automotive's interest cover is starting to look a bit thin.\n\nWe update our data on Setco Automotive every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Setco Automotive's dividend payments. Its dividend payments have fallen by 20% or more on at least one occasion over the past ten years. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was \u20b90.17 in 2009, compared to \u20b91.00 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 20% a year over that time. Setco Automotive's dividend payments have fluctuated, so it hasn't grown 20% every year, but the CAGR is a useful rule of thumb for approximating the historical growth.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Setco Automotive Limited (NSE:SETCO) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul?
