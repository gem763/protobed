Very weird??? X factor seems to be on the way out.. . . . terrible TV \u2014 Ben Foden (@ben_foden) October 30, 2011\n\nOf course, opinions can change, but back in October 2011 Foden freely admitted on Twitter that the X Factor \u2018seems to be on the way out\u2019 \u2013 which, to be fair, isn\u2019t totally untrue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he also called it \u2018terrible TV\u2019, which might\u2019ve raised at least a few eyebrows at ITV when they booked Foden for the new celebrity version of the show.\n\nIt\u2019s not like Foden would\u2019ve known that, nearly 8 years to the day he tweeted the above post, he\u2019d be taking to the X Factor stage himself \u2013 but then look where we are now\u2026\n\nBen\u2019s on the mic (Picture: Tony Marshall/Getty Images)\n\nFoden\u2019s bandmate Evans recently explained that the two of them had been singing together since they first met at the age of 16.\n\n\u2018Ben and I have known each other since we were 16, and we were pretty much singing in the back of a car since 16, on our way to rugby training,\u2019 he explained.\n\n\u2018So, that dream started then.\u2019\n\nShould the Try Star dream disappear on The X Factor: Celebrity, though, you wouldn\u2019t put it past the likes of Simon Cowell to turn Foden\u2019s previous Twitter comments on their head\u2026\n\nX Factor: Celebrity starts this Saturday at 8.35pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
