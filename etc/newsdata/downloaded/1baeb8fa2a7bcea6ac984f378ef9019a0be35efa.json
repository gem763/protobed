But he may cooperate as a way to salvage his reputation before he departs, people who know him told POLITICO. He might have even more of an impetus after Trump last week blamed Perry for pushing him to make the phone call to Ukraine's president that provoked the impeachment inquiry, said one person from the energy industry who is close to the administration.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, he has a lot to lose by getting embroiled in this and he\u2019s not going to want to hide things,\u201d said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preserve relationships with administration officials. \u201cHe\u2019s going to want to extract himself as cleanly as he can from this snare.\u201d\n\nPerry has maintained that he never heard the Bidens\u2019 names come up in discussions of Ukrainian corruption. But he is one of three officials who have led Trump\u2019s outreach to Ukraine since last spring \u2014 along with State Department envoy Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who dubbed the group the \u201cthree amigos.\u201d Some witnesses testifying behind closed doors to the House have said Perry was present during or just before conversations in the White House turned to the president\u2019s interest in seeing the Ukrainians investigate Democrats, according to accounts in multiple news outlets.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters that the administration had in fact expected a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government, in which Trump would release military aid to the country in exchange for it looking into allegations of 2016 election fraud.\n\nLast week, Trump said Perry had pressed him to make his now-controversial July 25 telephone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Perry appeared to hit back this week, telling The Wall Street Journal that Trump had directed him to consult with the president\u2019s personal attorney, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, about Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani has repeatedly pushed unsubstantiated allegations against Democrats \u2014 including accusations that Hunter Biden was guilty of corruption for his role on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, or that Ukraine\u2019s government had fabricated evidence about Trump and his associates during the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether that was crap or what,\u201d Perry told the Journal, regarding the latter claim .\n\nTrump\u2019s account of Perry pressing him to make the phone call sounded odd to some politically experienced people close to Perry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of a president who would say that somebody made them do something. I find it hard to believe that a president can be made to say or do anything,\u201d said Joe Allbaugh, a longtime Perry friend who served as gubernatorial chief of staff, presidential campaign manager and FEMA director for George W. Bush. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand it. It\u2019s the most powerful position in the world.\u201d\n\nAllbaugh also managed Perry\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign and was an adviser to Giuliani\u2019s 2008 presidential bid.\n\nUntil this month, the former Texas governor had largely avoided the reputation-ruining scandals that plagued others in the administration, including former Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.\n\n\n\nNow, more than a half-dozen Democratic lawmakers have voiced interest in hearing from Perry directly, including Rep. Joaqu\u00edn Castro (D-Texas), a member of the Intelligence Committee, who told reporters: \u201cRick Perry needs to testify.\u201d\n\nBesides questions about his interactions with Giuliani, lawmakers are also interested in Perry's effort to place Houston oil and gas executives \u2014 including one who had donated to his Texas political campaigns \u2014 on the advisory board of Ukraine\u2019s state-owned oil and gas company, Naftogaz.\n\nMorning Energy The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a senior member of two of the committees leading the inquiry, said he wants to see Perry testify as part of the inquiry.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a material witness,\u201d Connolly said Wednesday. \u201cHe was one of the \u2018three amigos.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one, including Secretary Perry, who\u2019s above the law,\u201d Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), who chairs the Energy and Commerce subcommittee overseeing DOE, told POLITICO. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way. He has to honor that.\u201d\n\nDespite Perry's insistence that he never mentioned the Bidens to Ukraine officials in his entreaties that they fight \u201ccorruption\" or heard others bring up the Democratic presidential candidate or his family, NBC News reported that Perry was seen leaving a White House meeting as former State Department official Fiona Hill heard participants discussing Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company that had paid Hunter Biden $50,000 a month. Hill went to that meeting on the orders of her former boss, John Bolton, who broke up a separate meeting because of his objections to Giuliani's involvement, The New York Times reported this week.\n\nUp to now, Perry has been in lockstep with the president, even though he had assailed Trump as a \u201ccancer on conservatism\" during their brief time as GOP presidential rivals in 2015.\n\nAs secretary, Perry has led an ill-fated effort to pressure federal energy regulators to offer a financial lifeline to coal-fired power plants, an effort that would benefit coal magnates who were major Trump campaign contributors. And he has been the administration's energy pitchman overseas, touting U.S. exports of oil, natural gas and coal as well as a controversial nuclear power technology arrangement with Saudi Arabia.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/31/12/d027593e4a68a89d8089b23ea094/191017-rick-perry-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
