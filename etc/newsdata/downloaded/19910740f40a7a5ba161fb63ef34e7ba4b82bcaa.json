The hours, days, crosses are very specific and unique to the scalper. The main advantage is to reduce your timing exposure of a trade in the market. Market openings are ideal for scalpers, however, unlike other techniques here you will not be able to use stop loss. I will explain in this presentation how we trade scalping without stop loss taking losses at the exact moment an order expires.Currently the international market is not in bullish or bullish trend, on the contrary, buyers make quick movements and close on time.The indexes, on the other hand, are good for buyers and not so much for sellers.Assets to be used in this presentation with scalping: EURUSD GBPUSD XAUUSD DAX SP500Co-Founder of \"Watch My Trading\", the first Spanish-language platform for real-time currency trading with macroeconomic data scenarios.
