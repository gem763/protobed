He also went because he\u2019s not available to play.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think he ever speaks about leaving. When he is available he plays, that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d\n\nBale came close to a move to Chinese club Jiangsu Suning last summer after Zidane said it would be \u201cbest for everyone\u201d if he left Real Madrid.\n\nBut the deal fell through at the last minute due to a disagreement over the transfer fee and Zidane is not expecting any fresh offers in January.\n\n\u2013 Unimpressed \u2013\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be an offer and I haven\u2019t thought about it either. Gareth is a Real Madrid player,\u201d said Zidane.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in the summer was the situation at the time and in the end Gareth stayed and all the better for everyone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true what was said didn\u2019t help but for me the result is the most important thing. He\u2019s an important player and it\u2019s important he plays and he plays well.\n\n\u201cIf in January he says he\u2019ll stay, there will be talk about the transfer window in the summer. Unfortunately people will always speak about these things but he\u2019s here and everyone is happy he\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nZidane claimed he has a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with Bale but sources have told AFP the forward remains on bad terms with the Frenchman.\n\nBale was particularly unimpressed by his omission from Madrid\u2019s squad to face Club Brugge in the Champions League earlier this month.\n\nAfter the match, Zidane put his absence down to a fitness issue but those close to Bale insist he was fully fit.\n\n\u201cI spoke to him and I spoke to James (Rodriguez). Both of them weren\u2019t available to play against Brugge and they didn\u2019t play,\u201d said Zidane. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else to say about that.\u201d\n\nBale will miss Madrid\u2019s La Liga game at home to Leganes on Wednesday, along with Nacho, who has a knee problem, and Marco Asensio, who is recovering from a anterior cruciate ligament injury.\n\nJames Rodriguez is also unlikely to be involved as he missed training on Tuesday due to the birth of his child.\n\nReal Madrid are sixth in the table but only two points off the top, with a game in hand.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Zinedine Zidane insists Gareth Bale was given permission by Real Madrid to travel to London on Monday, and claims the Welshman never talks about leaving the club.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sp30-Gareth-Bale.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
