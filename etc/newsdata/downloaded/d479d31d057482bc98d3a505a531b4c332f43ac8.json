Shape Created with Sketch. 12 useful WhatsApp features you didn\u2019t know existed 1/12 Unsend messages You can unsend a message by tapping and holding it, hitting the Delete symbol and selecting Delete for Everyone. The feature works for all types of messages, but only if they were sent less than seven minutes ago. 2/12 Dodge the blue ticks WhatsApp\u2019s blue ticks show when sent messages have been read, but you can disable them buy going to Settings > Account > Privacy > Read Receipts. However, bear in mind that, by doing so, you\u2019ll lose the ability to see when your own sent messages have been read. Another, more fiddly way of reading your messages without triggering the blue ticks, is enabling Aeroplane Mode before opening your messages - just remember to close the app before switching Aeroplane Mode off again. 3/12 Hide your 'last seen' time Prevent your friends from finding out when you were last online by hiding your last seen time. Go to Settings > Account > Privacy > Last Seen. As is the case with disabling read receipts, hiding your \u2018last seen\u2019 time will also stop you from seeing anybody else\u2019s. 4/12 Limit data usage You can control how much data you munch through on WhatsApp by limiting the types of media you automatically download on a mobile connection. Go to Settings > Data Usage and choose the best option for you. 5/12 Customise notifications If you\u2019re expecting an important WhatsApp message from someone, set a custom notification for them by opening the chat, tapping their name at the top and hitting Custom Notifications. 6/12 Format your messages To jazz up any of your messages, simply highlight it by tapping and holding it, hit the More Options key on the pop-up menu and tap the formatting option you want - bold, italic, strikethrough or monospace. 7/12 Type hands-free You can get Siri or Google Assistant to type your WhatsApp messages out for you by saying either \u201cHey Siri\u201d or \u201cOkay Google\u201d, followed by the name of the person you want to message and the actual contents of the message. 8/12 Mark chats as unread When you\u2019ve read a message but can\u2019t reply to it straight away, you can set a visual reminder by marking it as unread. On Android, long-press the conversation, and on iOS, swipe from left to right on a chat. 9/12 Email entire conversations You almost certainly won\u2019t do this on a regular basis, but it\u2019s a handy option to have. You can export entire conversations - complete with emoji and media attachments - by hitting More inside a chat a selecting Email Chat. 10/12 Mass-message contacts You can send the same message to lots of your contacts without lumping them all into one group, much like the BCC option on email, by hitting the New Broadcast option on the app\u2019s main menu. 11/12 Pin conversations You pin up to three contacts and groups to the top of your WhatsApp conversation list by tapping and holding a chat, then hitting the pin icon. 12/12 Make things easier to find You can easily mark key messages with a star, allowing you to find them easily when you need to. Just tap and hold a message and hit the star icon to save it, and return to it later by selecting Starred Messages in WhatsApp\u2019s main menu. 1/12 Unsend messages You can unsend a message by tapping and holding it, hitting the Delete symbol and selecting Delete for Everyone.

The idea is to prevent users from copying or forwarding messages to other users.\n\nIt is currently only available in the beta version of WhatsApp, though features tested in this way often find heir way onto the consumer version of the app.\n\nWhatsApp could also be in line for a major upgrade next year with the expected introduction of support for Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency.\n\nThe technology giant still needs to overcome various regulatory hurdles before it launches Libra, however once implemented it could allow people to send funds to contacts across Facebook-owned apps like Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp.", "description": "An update to WhatsApp has finally fixed one of the most annoying features of the popular messaging app. The latest version of the iOS app for iPhones and iPads\u00a0will finally allow users to properly mute conversations that they do not want to receive notifications from.
