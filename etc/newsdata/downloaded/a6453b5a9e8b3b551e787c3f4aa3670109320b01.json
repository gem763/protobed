Auto Trader (AUTOA.L) gained 1%.\n\n\u201cGiven the largest commissions received by brokers tend to come via the models set to be banned, it will be interesting to see how lenders, brokers and dealerships react,\u201d said Sarah Nield, financial services risk and regulation director at PwC.\n\nThe FCA is also proposing changes to commission disclosure rules and guidance to give consumers more relevant information in all consumer credit markets.\n\nThe watchdog will consult on the rules until January 2020 and publish final rules later next year.\n\nIt estimates it would cost the industry 35 million pounds to implement the ban in the first year, and 5 million pounds annually thereafter.", "description": "Britain's markets watchdog has proposed banning auto dealers and brokers from receiving commission linked to interest rates on loans used to finance car purchases, a step it said would save consumers 165 million pounds ($208.4 million) annually.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
