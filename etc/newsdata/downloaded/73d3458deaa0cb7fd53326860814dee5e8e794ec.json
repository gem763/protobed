The others, Emily Batty and Haley Smith finished ninth and 12th respectively.\n\n\"Right now I am still the second ranked Canadian,\" said Pendrel, who won silver in Rio in 2016. \"We just all have to work hard this winter and whoever has the best World Cup next year that should be the person who should go. We're in a good spot, it's pretty exciting and it's going to be a good motivation for all of us.

She said she was \"so nervous\" going into the race.\n\n\"I've never started in the front row at a World Cup, let alone a world champs,\" she said.\n\nSmith praised the enthusiastic crowd and lauded the course, saying it was \"tacky and fast\" with no mud lingering after steady rain Friday.\n\nCanadian Sandra Walter, 39, finished 18th in the field of 61 riders for the best World Cup result of her career.\n\n\"My first world championship ever was here in 1998 when I was a junior,\" she said. \"I had really no idea what the sport was about until I came here and witnessed the best in the world. That fuelled my fire and now 20 odd years later I'm back.\"\n\nWhen asked if she'll retire, she joked \"how can I retire when I just keep getting better?\"\n\nFerrand Prevot bounced back from surgery on both her legs earlier in the season. Her comeback was signalled by a top finish in July in Italy. Ferrand Prevot has won world championships in three bike disciplines \u2014 road, cyclo-cross and mountain bike.
