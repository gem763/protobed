The league, which has a huge Chinese fanbase and was on the eve of a preseason trip to China, felt the immediate backlash. Morey issued subsequent tweets to try and stop the bleeding while Rockets star James Harden apologized for the tweet \u2014 but to no avail.\n\nChina began to crack down on the NBA almost immediately, as Chinese sportswear brands either suspended or severed ties with the Rockets. The Communist government also blacked out broadcasts of the league\u2019s preseason games in the country and canceled NBA Cares events and media availabilities ahead of the exhibition games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets.\n\nGINGRICH: WHAT CHINA'S NBA SMACKDOWN SHOWS\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver made clear that he in no way intends to distance from China, a decision which he claims to be in the best interest of the league. And while players remained silent while on mainland China, the league\u2019s most vocal critics of President Trump, his administration and societal issues also mostly chose to stay quiet, opting to either \u201clearn more\u201d about the situation \u2014 or take more shots at the White House.\n\nCommenting on the latest, Ingraham slammed the athletes for prioritizing their business agenda and called for the United States to step in and sever all ties with China if the NBA and U.S. athletes won't. Her bold call comes amid recent headway in trade negotiations between the two countries.\n\n\"They're a communist force, they're subjugating, oppressing, demonizing their own people and now they have so much outsized market influence, who's gonna say no to that,\" Ingraham said.\n\n\"They have a million people in concentration camps...I mean...somehow because China has all this coin they're a growing marketplace, and this is why it was so dangerous for the United States to allow China to become so powerful economically and to help them,\" she added.\n\nTo watch the full episode featuring Ingraham's take on China, adult tricker treating, and more, join Fox Nation and watch the latest episode of \"Laura and Raymond\" today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
