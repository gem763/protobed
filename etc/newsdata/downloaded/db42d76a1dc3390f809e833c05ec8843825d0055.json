Countless political operatives, journalists, actors and regular, concerned citizens all made it when President Trump tweeted a doctored video featuring Nickelback\u2019s song \u201cPhotograph\u201d on Oct. 2, and again when Twitter took down the meme, citing a potential copyright violation.\n\nAD\n\nThat eye-popping, three-figure sales percentage tied to Trump\u2019s missive is misleading, though: No one downloaded \u201cPhotograph\u201d during the four days before Trump\u2019s tweet. When the president tweeted the meme Wednesday, the song was downloaded 200 times that day and 300 times on Thursday, according to data from Nielsen Music, which tracks online sales. (For some reason, it was also downloaded 100 times on Sept. 27.)\n\nAD\n\nNielsen, which also monitors streaming services (but not Twitter), reported that video and audio streams of \u201cPhotograph\u201d increased by just 38 percent compared to the two days before Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\nBut never mind the details: The narrative of Trump boosting Nickelback was too good to ignore, just like after the president sent out the offending tweet the previous week. \u201cOverhea[r]d: Trump caused Nickelback to trend with a meme,\u201d tweeted actor and activist George Takei. \u201cI consider that an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump tweeting out a Nickelback video should be an impeachable offense. \u2014 Scott Dworkin (@funder) October 2, 2019\n\nBringing Nickelback into any fight in 2019 is an impeachable offense. \u2014 The Sklar Brothers (@SklarBrothers) October 3, 2019\n\nTrump getting Nickelback stuck in my head should be an impeachable offense \u2014 Thor Benson (@thor_benson) October 2, 2019\n\nTweeting Nickelback songs is *probably* an impeachable offense.#TrumpMeltdown \u2014 Grant Stern (@grantstern) October 2, 2019\n\nMaking #Nickelback even briefly relevant again is an impeachable offense. \u2014 Steve Persall (@StevePersall) October 3, 2019\n\nFor all the terrible things Donald Trump has done, now he\u2019s responsible for a Nickelback song being stuck in my head. If that\u2019s not an impeachable offense then nothing is. \u2014 Dan Merker (@danmerker) October 3, 2019\n\n'Another impeachable offense': Internet loses it when Trump tweets out Nickelback memehttps://t.co/nt2D43tgZx \u2014 Raw Story (@RawStory) October 2, 2019\n\nBeing accused of liking Nickelback became a common campaign insult years ago. But the \u201cimpeachable offense\u201d construction began last week and has shown no signs of going away anytime soon.\n\nStarting with the last presidential campaign cycle \u2014 and even after Trump\u2019s victory \u2014 conventional wisdom held that Trump would be good for comedy. How couldn\u2019t he be? Sure, late-night comedians had a penchant for making fun of politicians on the right, but the hyper-drive pace of news emanating from a former reality TV star turned unconventional president would have to create the perfect recipe for jokes. After all, when the president of the United States uses a 2005 song from a much-maligned Canadian band to attack a political rival as he faces an impeachment inquiry, it\u2019s now called \u201ca Wednesday.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe\u2019re now nearly three years into the Trump presidency, so we can survey the results. If political jokes are a biosphere, it does not feel like this moment is a rainforest teeming with various forms of life. Nope. We\u2019re closer to living in a desert with five kinds of weird shrubs to look at.\n\nBut that\u2019s not entirely due to a lack of creativity. Social media and particularly Twitter, which is Trump\u2019s preferred form of communication, have given anyone the ability to instantly comment on the latest outrageous news item. Sometimes there are only so many jokes that can be made about the same subject, no matter how outrageous it is. This is why you may hear late-night TV hosts all deliver a variation of the same joke, and why many professional comedians have said Trump is bad for comedy.\n\n\u201cIt makes for the same types of jokes all the time,\u201d said Michael Che, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d co-head writer and \u201cWeekend Update\u201d co-anchor, in an interview with The Post in 2017. \u201cWhen you talk about him, you\u2019re pretty much saying the same things about him.\u201d\n\nThat goes for nonprofessional joke-slingers, too.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Just like Nickelback.", "authors": ["Elahe Izadi", "Pop Culture Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/isdGbXGHWnteJmQx3NpCHJlR3SY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OCM53EHF5UI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
