WANG JIANG / FOR CHINA DAILY\n\nChina will intensify international cooperation with other countries to jointly fight hunger and ensure global good security, said a white paper released on Monday.\n\nThe country will also continue to expand and diversify sources of food imports to balance its own food security, said the white paper titled \u201cFood Security in China\u201d, released by the State Council Information Office.\n\nChina has successfully fed nearly 20 percent of the world\u2019s total population with just 9 percent of the world\u2019s farmland and 6 percent of the world\u2019s total freshwater resources, Zhang Wufeng, head of the National Food and Strategic\n\nReserves Administration, said at a news conference.\n\nWhile China\u2019s population accounts for nearly onefifth of the world\u2019s total, its food production accounts for a quarter of the world\u2019s total, according to the\n\nwhite paper.\n\nPer capita grain output in China is 470 kilograms, a rise of 14 percent\n\ncompared with 1996, and a rise of 126 percent compared with 1949, it said.\n\n\u201cWe will continue the efforts to ensure China\u2019s food security so the rice bowl remains firmly in our own hands,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nIn the meantime, China has been intensifying international cooperation in food and agriculture and opening up its domestic food market, especially since it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, the white paper said.\n\nLast year, China imported about 116 million metric tons of grains, including 88 million metric tons of soybeans, more than nine times the amount in 1996, it said.\n\nThe white paper also said that China will actively participate in global and regional food security governance, explore new models for international food cooperation and conduct comprehensive and high-standard international food\n\ncooperation.\n\n\u201cChina will keep opening up and intensifying international cooperation in food and agriculture,\u201d said Su Wei, deputy secretary-general of the National Development and Reform Commission, adding that China is willing to share with other countries its experiences in improving food security.\n\n\u201cWe hope to see hunger and poverty eradicated from the world as soon as possible,\u201d Su said.\n\nBy the end of 2016, China had helped more than 50 countries in Africa to carry out nearly 500 agricultural assistance programs, covering areas including farming, grain storage, agricultural machinery and agricultural product processing, according to the white paper.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/15/5da4ef8ca310cf3e97a13121.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
