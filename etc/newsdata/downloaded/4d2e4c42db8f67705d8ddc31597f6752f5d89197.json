Our media is filled with enthusiastic announcements about new fossil fuel projects, or the unveiling of the latest fossil-fuelled supercar, as if there\u2019s no relationship between such things and climate change.\n\nIn Australia, the disconnect among our political leaders on the deadly nature of fossil fuels is particularly breathtaking.\n\nI never thought I'd see the Australian rainforest burning. What will it take for us to wake up to the climate crisis? | Jo\u00eblle Gergis Read more\n\nPrime minister Scott Morrison continues to sing the praises of coal, while members of the government call for subsidies for coal-fired power plants. A few days ago, the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, urged that the nation\u2019s old and polluting coal-fired power plants be allowed to run \u201cat full tilt\u201d.\n\nIn the past, many of us have tolerated such pronouncements as the utterings of idiots \u2013 in the true, original Greek meaning of the word as one interested only in their own business. But the climate crisis has now grown so severe that the actions of the denialists have turned predatory: they are now an immediate threat to our children.\n\nA \u2018colossal failure\u2019 of climate activism\n\nEach year the situation becomes more critical. In 2018, global emissions of greenhouse gases rose by 1.7%, while the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere jumped by 3.5 parts per million \u2013 the largest ever observed increase.\n\nNo climate report or warning, no political agreement nor technological innovation has altered the ever-upward trajectory of the pollution. This simple fact forces me to look back on my 20 years of climate activism as a colossal failure.\n\nMany climate scientists think we are already so far down the path of destruction that it is impossible to stabilise the global temperature at 1.5\u2103 above the pre-industrial average without yet to be developed drawdown technologies such as those that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. On current trends, within a decade or so, stabilising at 2\u2103 will likewise be beyond our grasp.\n\nAnd on the other side of that threshold, nature\u2019s positive feedback loops promise to fling us into a hostile world. By 2100 \u2013 just 80 years away \u2013 if our trajectory does not change, it is estimated that Earth will be 4\u2103 warmer than it was before we began burning fossil fuels.\n\n'Going to the streets again': what you need to know about Friday's climate strike Read more\n\nFar fewer humans will survive on our warming planet\n\nThat future Earth may have enough resources to support far fewer people than the 7.6 billion it supports today. British scientist James Lovelock has predicted a future human population of just a billion people. Mass deaths are predicted to result from, among other causes, disease outbreaks, air pollution, malnutrition and starvation, heatwaves and suicide.\n\nMy children, and those of many prominent polluters and climate denialists, will probably live to be part of that grim winnowing \u2013 a world that the Alan Joneses and Andrew Bolts of the world have laboured so hard to create.\n\nHow should Australia\u2019s parents deal with those who labour so joyously to create a world in which a large portion of humanity will perish? As I have become ever more furious at the polluters and denialists, I have come to understand they are threatening my children\u2019s wellbeing as much as anyone who might seek to harm a child.\n\nYoung people themselves are now mobilising against the danger. Increasingly they\u2019re giving up on words and resorting to actions. Extinction Rebellion is the Anthropocene\u2019s answer to the UK working class Chartists, the US Declaration of Independence and the defenders of the Eureka Stockade.\n\nIts declaration states:\n\nThis is our darkest hour. Humanity finds itself embroiled in an event unprecedented in its history, one which, unless immediately addressed, will catapult us further into the destruction of all we hold dear [\u2026] The wilful complicity displayed by our government has shattered meaningful democracy and cast aside the common interest in favour of short-term gain and private profit [\u2026] We hereby declare the bonds of the social contract to be null and void.\n\nWords have not cut through. Is rebellion the only option?\n\nNot yet a year old, Extinction Rebellion has had an enormous impact. In April it shut down six critical locations in London, overwhelmed the police and justice system with 1,000 arrests and forced the British government to become the first nation ever to declare a climate emergency.\n\nSo unstable is our current societal response that a single young woman, Greta Thunberg, has been able to spark a profoundly powerful global movement. Less than a year ago she went on a one-person school strike. Today school strikes for climate action are a global phenomenon.\n\nTasmania is burning. The climate disaster future has arrived while those in power laugh at us | Richard Flanagan Read more\n\nOn Friday in Australia and elsewhere, school principals must decide whether they will allow their students to march in the global climate strike in an effort to save themselves from the climate predators in our midst, or force them to stay and study for a future that will not, on current trends, eventuate.\n\nI will be marching with the strikers in Melbourne, and I believe teachers should join their pupils on that day. After all, us older generation should be painfully aware that our efforts have not been enough to protect our children.\n\nThe new and carefully planned rebellion by the young generation forces us earlier generations of climate activists to re-examine our strategy. Should we continue to use words to try to win the debate? Or should we become climate rebels? Changing the language around climate denialism will, I hope, sharpen our focus as we ponder what comes next.", "description": "The climate crisis is so severe the actions of the denialists are now an immediate threat to our children", "authors": ["Tim Flannery"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81078dc199df1dacdd773846bf86ac0c60e16b0c/0_239_4066_2440/master/4066.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=15e5eb2de55c5d2abcd2b4a736450558", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
