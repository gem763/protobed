I don\u2019t know if it was the film company or the hire company, but someone reported the van.\u2019\n\nDaniel was seen bloodied on set last month (Picture: Splash News)\n\nThe source added: \u2018It is an unbelievable blunder to have caused such a massive security risk.\n\n\u2018I expect the film company will face a firm slap on the wrist but it won\u2019t stop film companies being allowed on base because it brings in a lot of money.\u2019\n\nThe site \u2013 which houses thousands of servicemen across 481 hectares \u2013 is often used for filming and was the set for parts of last year\u2019s Mission Impossible: Fallout, which starred Tom Cruise.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what members of cast and crew of Cary Fukunaga\u2019s Bond film were on set during these recently-shot scenes.\n\nNo Time To Die will be Daniel Craig\u2019s last outing as Bond and the 51-year-old has been joined by a string of famous faces, including Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch in the upcoming instalment, with Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw returning to the fold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has been intense speculation over just who would be stepping into his tux next \u2013 with Richard Madden, Idris Elba and Tom Hiddleston among those tipped for the role.\n\nMetro.co.uk contacted Bond reps for comment.\n\nNo Time To Die is released in UK cinemas on 2 April, 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
