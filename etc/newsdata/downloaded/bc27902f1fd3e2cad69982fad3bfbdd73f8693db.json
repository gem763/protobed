Cheri Bustos, who leads House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, advised the caucus\u2019 most vulnerable members to gauge support and test their message through polling in their respective districts \u2014 surveys that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee would help fund, according to multiple people on the call. She also said the campaign arm could deploy digital ads in the future.\n\nBustos also shared the results of the DCCC\u2019s first poll focused on impeachment since Pelosi formalized an inquiry last week. The poll found that 54 percent of likely voters support Democrats\u2019 inquiry, according to a summary obtained by POLITICO.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

It came after leaders faced blowback from some lawmakers, particularly those from swing districts, over past messaging stumbles.\n\nDemocratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries outlined a plan to message the issue with \u201crepetition,\u201d according to multiple people on the call. He named six words that Democrats will use \u2014 \u201cbetrayal, abuse of power, national security\u201d \u2014 as they make the case that Trump abused his office when he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, whose panel will be responsible for crafting any articles of impeachment, endorsed the strategy as outlined by Pelosi.\n\n\u201cIf we stick to the speaker\u2019s plan, we will prevail,\u201d Nadler said, according to a person on the call. A spokesman for Nadler confirmed that the chairman supports Pelosi\u2019s approach.\n\nHouse Democrats returned to their districts this weekend for a two-week recess, during which many will face pressure to carry the caucus\u2019 message in the nascent stages of its impeachment inquiry.\n\nSeveral freshman lawmakers from battleground districts asked Pelosi and other Democratic leaders before they left Washington for help handl ing their caucus\u2019 impeachment message at home.\n\nThe DCCC poll, conducted Sept. 26 - 27, showed voters support a pro-impeachment Democrat over an anti-impeachment Republican by 11 percentage points.\n\nINTERACTIVE: See where House lawmakers stand on impeachment\n\nBut Bustos cautioned that the DCCC poll reflected national support, not support from specific swing districts. She said members should deploy their own polls \u2014 with help from the campaign committee \u2014 and us e existing field staff to focus their messaging .\n\nA POLITICO/Morning Consult poll released last week also found that support for impeachment proceedings has risen since Pelosi announced plans to formalize the inquiry.\n\nPelosi, speaking this weekend in Texas, dismissed potential political consequences of impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't matter,\u201d Pelosi said in the wrap-up event of a Texas Tribune festival. \u201cOur first responsibility is to the Constitution.\u201d\n\nOn the call, Pelosi reiterated that Democrats would remain focused on their legislative agenda and said she hopes Trump doesn't walk away from a deal on trade or drug pricing \u2014 a dual approach that many moderates have said is key to keeping the House.\n\nLawmakers were also told on the conference call which committees will be handling which aspects of the investigation. The Intelligence Committee will focus on the substance of the president\u2019s alleged actions as outlined in a whistleblower complaint that the Trump administration initially withheld from Congress, while the Foreign Affairs Committee plans to probe the details of the State Department\u2019s possible involvement with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney.\n\nThe Oversight and Reform Committee, meanwhile, will look into the potential misuse of classification systems at the White House \u2014 an apparent reference to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, which alleged that White House officials sought to \u201clock down\u201d the transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine's president.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nThe Intelligence panel will reconvene in Washington this week despite the scheduled recess as it works to corroborate the whistleblower\u2019s allegations. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of that panel, announced on Friday that the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, will appear before the committee behind closed doors this coming Friday.\n\nAppearing on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday morning, Schiff said he expects the whistleblower to testify \u201cvery soon,\u201d adding that he is waiting for acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to grant security clearances to the whistleblower\u2019s legal team, which is being led by Andrew Bakaj, a veteran national security attorney.\n\nIn a statement later Sunday, Bakaj and his co-counsel I. Charles McCullough said no date or time had been set but \u201cdiscussions continue to occur to coordinate and finalize logistics.\u201d\n\n\u201cProtecting the whistleblower\u2019s identity is paramount,\u201d Bakaj said.\n\nDemocrats are also seeking information from the Trump administration about crucial military aid to Ukraine that was put on hold earlier this year around the same time that Trump asked Zelensky to look into Biden and his son Hunter. On Friday, the chiefs of the House Appropriations and Budget committees demanded documents as they seek to find out \u201cwhen, why, and how the president and [the Office of Management and Budget] withheld this funding.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats have suggested that Trump withheld the military aid in order to gain leverage over Zelensky, though there has been no clear link established between the aid and Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky.\n\nHeather Caygle contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e3/33/4eb4aa4d43ef8a725742a823ae0d/20190929-pelosi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
