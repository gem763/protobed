Photo: Pete Marovich/Getty Images\n\nYou\u2019d think Senator Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, would be particularly aware of the political risks of saying stupid things at obscure events. Her election in 2014 was immeasurably aided by a video that surfaced of her general-election opponent, Congressman Bruce Braley, telling a bunch of Texas trial lawyers that they should help him ensure a Democratic Senate to keep an \u201cIowa farmer,\u201d Chuck Grassley, from chairing the Judiciary Committee.\n\nNow, as Ernst approaches her own reelection challenge in 2020, a video has surfaced wherein she tells a town hall meeting that Democrats and Republicans need to get together \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d to deal with Social Security, which is universal Republican code for cutting benefits to curb spending on this and other safety-net programs to make room for tax cuts and higher defense spending. The pro-Democratic super-PAC American Bridge joyfully shared it with America:\n\nI\u2019m sure that Ernst will claim she didn\u2019t mean what she said, or that the solutions she had in mind might involve giving Social Security beneficiaries more money or Starbucks gift cards. But anyone even vaguely familiar with Republican thinking on \u201centitlement reform\u201d knows the drill: The GOP is terrified of intense public hostility to conservative schemes to \u201csave\u201d Social Security by reducing benefits (usually by privatizing them and then cutting them over time), and needs Democratic \u201ccover\u201d to get \u2019er done. But Democrats, you see, are as afraid of doing this as Republicans, which is why it needs to happen in private where those pesky seniors can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on.\n\nAs Iowa Starting Line pointed out, Ernst has in the past expressed interest in privatizing Social Security (the \u201csolution\u201d George W. Bush proposed in 2005, which was soon abandoned by Republicans alarmed by the backlash). Given her background as a wing nut in the Iowa legislature, that\u2019s hardly surprising, as Jamelle Bouie noted in 2014:\n\nAmong other stances, Ernst has endorsed impeachment for President Obama, expressed the belief that states could nullify federal laws, and supported \u201cpersonhood\u201d anti-abortion laws that would outlaw most forms of contraception. In addition, she\u2019s slammed Medicaid recipients for not taking \u201cpersonal responsibility for their health\u201d\u2014even though recipients have to apply for coverage\u2014and talked extensively about \u201cAgenda 21,\u201d a decades-old U.N. recommendation for environmental sustainability that forms the basis for conspiracy-mongering on the far right. \u201cThe United Nations has imposed this upon us, and as a U.S. senator, I would say, \u2018No more. No more Agenda 21,\u2019 \u201d she said during a January forum for GOP Senate candidates. Of all of Ernst\u2019s positions, her most mainstream is support for private accounts in Social Security, which has intellectual respectability in the GOP, even as it\u2019s opposed by most Americans.\n\nBut even if you are gullible enough to believe that she is looking at Social Security with anything other than bad intent, the \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d comment is a terrible look for her. She was first elected, after all, by campaigning as a hog-castratin\u2019, motorcycle-riding National Guard vet who operated purely on the basis of common sense and being totally in tune with The People (at the time I noted that \u201cissues are absolute kryptonite to her campaign\u201d). Treating Social Security as a \u201cproblem\u201d that can only be \u201csolved\u201d by going \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d has to make her campaign staff crazy. But she, of all people, deserves no slack or sympathy here. Just ask Bruce Braley.", "description": "Iowa senator Joni Ernst, who in the past has expressed affection for Social Security privatization, may have damaged her reelection big by suggesting Social Security was a \u201cproblem\u201d that Republicans and Democrats should \u201csolve\u201d behind closed doors.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/05/joni-ernst.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
