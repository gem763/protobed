And that is precisely what the Framers intended.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the decision \"a resounding victory for the rule of law, our Constitution and its system of checks and balances\" in a statement.\n\n\"It is a victory for our democracy, as the courts reaffirm the Congress's authority and responsibility to conduct oversight and consider legislation on behalf of the American people,\" she said.\n\n(MORE: Judge rules Trump must turn over tax returns for hush money investigation)\n\nThe ruling in D.C. comes at the end of a week that began with another ruling lost by Trump's team regarding his financial information. On Monday, Trump lost his bid to shield his tax returns from the Manhattan District Attorney's office, which subpoenaed them as part of an investigation into \"hush payments\" to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal.\n\nIn that case, Trump's legal team filed an immediate notice of appeal to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and the 2nd Circuit at least temporarily agreed to block the president's accounting firm from immediately having to hand over the requested tax returns in an emergency administrative stay.\n\nTrump has kept aspects of his financials more under wraps than have previous presidents. He's the first president in over 40 years not to release his tax returns.", "description": "The federal circuit of appeals in Washington, D.C., has affirmed a lower court order rejecting legal challenges from President Donald Trump's legal team to a subpoena from the House Oversight Committee regarding the president's financial records from Mazars, an accounting firm the Trump family", "authors": ["John Santucci", "Ali Dukakis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qg3lNw7NjvPPgprIxw6SPg--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.gma.com/trump-microphones-gty-ps-191011_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
