According to Ars Technica, a separate entity owned by Rothschild, called Rothschild Connected Devices Innovations (RCDI), raised a lawsuit in 2017 against GPS tech company Garmin for infringing a patent.\n\nGarmin's lawyers reportedly explained that Rothschild's patents for a \"system and method for creating a personalised consumer product\" weren't valid and breached US patent laws. RCDI eventually dropped the lawsuit while Garmin filed a counter-claim against the company to pay $20,000 for its legal fees.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nMicrosoft expands its patent protection program to include Azure-powered IoT devices\n\nMicrosoft is extending its Azure IP Advantage patent-protection program into the IoT space to help its customers fight patent trolls.\n\nSupreme Court puts new restriction on patent trolls\n\nThe high court unanimously curbs the use of \"forum shopping,\" limiting patent litigation to the judicial district where the defendant is incorporated.\n\nMicrosoft to aid Azure customers in taking on patent trolls\n\nMicrosoft's new Azure IP Advantage program is providing Microsoft cloud users with access to 10,000 Microsoft patents to help them fight 'baseless patent lawsuits.'\n\nGoogle holds patent giveaway for startups to ward off trolls\n\nGoogle wants to give two patent families to 50 startups to bolster a tech industry led anti-troll network.\n\nFujifilm announces first 30TB LTO-8 tapes following patent settlement, import ban (TechRepublic)\n\nDemand for tape backup remains strong, though sales were halted due to a recently settled patent dispute.", "description": "The patent is for a system and method for distributing digital photographic images.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/07/06/9f67e014-24d6-46cc-9610-47991fc17efb/thumbnail/770x578/bbbc86d405d4df9c7a3c9e1b11c8ca24/legal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
