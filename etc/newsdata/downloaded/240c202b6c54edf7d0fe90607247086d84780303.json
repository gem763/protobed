The forces backing impeachment, meanwhile, are telling us those same defendants are obstructing a lawful impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u2026\n\nMy discomfort in the last few years, first with Russiagate and now with Ukrainegate and impeachment, stems from the belief that the people pushing hardest for Trump\u2019s early removal are more dangerous than Trump. Many Americans don\u2019t see this because they\u2019re not used to waking up in a country where you\u2019re not sure who the president will be by nightfall. They don\u2019t understand that this predicament is worse than having a bad president.\n\nThe Trump presidency is the first to reveal a full-blown schism between the intelligence community and the White House. Senior figures in the CIA, NSA, FBI and other agencies made an open break from their would-be boss before Trump\u2019s inauguration, commencing a public war of leaks that has not stopped.\n\n\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t believe most Americans have thought through what a successful campaign to oust Donald Trump would look like. Most casual news consumers can only think of it in terms of Mike Pence becoming president. The real problem would be the precedent of a de facto intelligence community veto over elections, using the lunatic spookworld brand of politics that has dominated the last three years of anti-Trump agitation.\n\nCIA/FBI-backed impeachment could also be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If Donald Trump thinks he\u2019s going to be jailed upon leaving office, he\u2019ll sooner or later figure out that his only real move is to start acting like the \u201cdictator\u201d MSNBC and CNN keep insisting he is. Why give up the White House and wait to be arrested, when he still has theoretical authority to send Special Forces troops rappelling through the windows of every last Russiagate/Ukrainegate leaker? That would be the endgame in a third world country, and it\u2019s where we\u2019re headed, unless someone calls off this craziness.
