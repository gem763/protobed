General assembly certainly took some of the optimism out of the air,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.\n\nWall Street's major indexes opened higher on positive comments on trade talks from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin but slipped after data showed that U.S. consumer confidence for September fell by the most in nine months, to a reading of 125.1, well below economists' expectations of 133.5.\n\nThe retail index slipped 0.6%, while a 1.2% drop in ecommerce giant Amazon.com Inc was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 the Nasdaq.\n\nThe report is a bit of a concern, said Everett Millman, precious metals specialist at Gainesville Coins in Lutz, Florida, especially as \"consumer confidence has been pretty high at least in the U.S.\"\n\nInvestors will now look to other data due later this week, including the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation, for more clues on the strength of the U.S. economy.\n\nAt 12:17 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 12.19 points, or 0.05%, at 26,937.80, the S&P 500 was down 5.72 points, or 0.19%, at 2,986.06. The Nasdaq Composite was down 52.48 points, or 0.65%, at 8,059.98.\n\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the energy sector down 1.13%, tracking a drop in oil prices.\n\nOnly the defensive consumer staples, utilities and real estate were higher.\n\nApple Inc was a bright spot, gaining 0.4% after Jefferies assumed coverage with a \"buy\" rating and highlighted the iPhone maker's 5G potential.\n\nVideo streaming platform Netflix Inc dropped 3.4% to a near nine-month low after Pivotal Research cut its price target.\n\nNike Inc fell 0.4%, ahead of the world's largest sportswear maker's first-quarter results after the bell.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.31-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2.42-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 31 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 35 new highs and 68 new lows.
