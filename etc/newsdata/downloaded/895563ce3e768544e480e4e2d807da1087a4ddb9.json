What reasons should they have for investing in Stadia rather than a traditional console? And will Google follow through on their promise to \"disrupt\" the $170bn (\u00a3132bn) gaming industry?\n\n\u201cNetflix revolutionised the video rental business in two ways,\u201d Doronichev says. \u201cOne is they disrupted the technology and delivery methods. And they disrupted the business model with subscription. But they didn't do it overnight. That was a long journey to get there. And we're starting with disrupting the technology side of things.\n\n\u201cIt's a big enough disruption that even the most sophisticated technologists and game industry veterans are still needing time to understand how it's going to work. And what is the impact? To try to do all those things simultaneously is going to be too much and too hard for everyone to understand. Consumers, yes, but more importantly the industry itself.\u201d", "description": "As Google gears up to release Google Stadia on Nov 19, its potentially games industry shaking streaming service, product director Andrey Doronichev is keen to set the record straight.", "authors": ["Tom Hoggins", "Laurence Dodds"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gaming/2019/10/16/google-stadia-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwWbF8Ku0AbrLIonOnvugqhk.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
