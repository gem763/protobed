Photograph: H Richards\n\nPalorchestids were a sister family to the better-known Diprotodontidae and became extinct some time during the Late Pleistocene, probably as a result of human activity and climatic change.\n\nBut mystery has surrounded the exact make-up of palorchestids because very few fossils have been found.\n\nWhat is known is that they died out before other mega-fauna, said the Monash university researcher Hazel Richards.\n\n\u201cThe fact that there just aren\u2019t that many of these guys in the fossil record probably tells us something about the way they were distributed,\u201d Richards told Guardian Australia.\n\n\u201cWe find them all over Australia but the population size was probably quite small. And they were quite sparsely arranged. It\u2019s not like these guys were travelling in herds or in large numbers as has been kind of hypothesised for some of the other megafauna.\u201d\n\nThe study found that as they evolved, palorchestids grew larger and stranger. While they varied in size, the researchers said they were \u201cbigger than previously thought, with the largest species likely weighing over 1000 kg\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe used a method where you take the circumference of the bone and that tells you something about how much weight is being borne through each of the four legs,\u201d Richards said.\n\n\u201cWe came up with a number that was substantially larger than what has been estimated before and puts them some way up there among some of the the largest marsupials that we ever had in Australia.\u201d\n\nThe fossils were obtained from museums in Australia and London\u2019s Natural History Museum.\n\n\u201cWhat makes them so weird is the kind of combination of features that they have,\u201d Richards said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got an extremely long pointed face, really tiny little eyes, protrusible tongue, something maybe something a bit like a giraffe, and extremely muscular four quarters ... and huge claws.\n\n\u201cSome of the other large megafauna ... like diprotodon they\u2019re not as muscular proportionately as ... and also their claws are much smaller. So these guys were clearly specialised for doing something with their four limbs.\u201d\n\nTheir claws would have been made digging difficult, \u201clike trying to dig with a chef\u2019s knife\u201d, while their elbows, which could not \u201cbend or straighten, are \u201ctotally unheard of in any other mammal, living or extinct\u201d.\n\nRichards said future research would aim to determine why palorchestids came to be how they were.\n\n\u201cThe plan now is to zero in and conduct some functional, biomechanical analyses to try and understand exactly what they were adapted for,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat foods are they targeting, why would they have become so different from everything else?\u201d", "description": "Researchers are building a picture of palorchestids, which had tapir-like skulls and large scimitar-like claws", "authors": ["Luke Henriques-Gomes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23cfae1aa5733b8eebcdfe28affe25ddc6c971be/0_0_1745_1047/master/1745.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=15f70b2c60fb25d413e6430898da88a0", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
