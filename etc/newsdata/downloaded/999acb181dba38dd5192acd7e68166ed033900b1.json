(AP) - \"I'd like to thank the academy\" is a phrase many only ever get to say in front of their bathroom mirrors. But 16 student filmmakers actually got to utter those words on stage Thursday at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science in Beverly Hills.\n\nNot only that: They're all also eligible to compete in the 2020 Academy Awards. That's the power of the Student Academy Awards, an event that is now in its 46th year.\n\nIt was an emotional night for many, like Kalee McCollaum of Brigham Young University.\n\n\"I never thought those words would come out of my mouth,\" she said on the stage flanked by two giant Oscar statuettes in the Samuel L. Goldwyn theater. McCollaum won the gold medal for animation for her short, \"Grendel.\"\n\nWinners are now eligible for the animated short, live action short and documentary short categories at the Oscars.\n\nPhil Lord and Chris Miller, who co-directed \"The Lego Movie,\" presented the animation awards, deadpanning that \"no one ever thanks the presenter.\"\n\nFILE - In this Feb. 4, 2019 file photo, an Oscar statue appears at the 91st Academy Awards Nominees Luncheon in Beverly Hills, Calif.

Authenticity in casting was of utmost importance to Jelinsky.\n\n\"This film would have not been nearly as impactful without your talent,\" Jelinsky said to the film's star, Jesse James Keitel.\n\nThere were 1,615 entries from 360 colleges and universities around the world. Categories recognized include narrative, documentary, animated and alternative/experimental productions by American and international college students.\n\nWinners are voted on by members of the film academy.

Tickets to the ceremony are free to the public, who stand in line outside hoping to get a spot in the room.\n\n\"You are the future of film: a future that is diverse, international and very bright,\" said film academy president David Rubin. \"On behalf of all the members of the academy, we can't wait to see the stories you next tell.\"\n\nThe 2019 Student Academy Award winners:\n\n- \"Patron Saint,\" Georden West, Emerson College\n\n- \"Game Changer,\" Aviv Mano, Ringling College of Art and Design\n\n- \"Grendel,\" Kalee McCollaum, Brigham Young University\n\n- \"Two,\" Emre Okten, University of Southern California\n\n- \"Daughter,\" Daria Kashcheeva, Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts, Prague\n\n- \"All That Remains,\" Eva Rendle, University of California, Berkeley\n\n- \"Sankofa,\" Princess Garrett, Villanova University\n\n- \"Something to Say,\" Abby Lieberman and Joshua Lucas, Columbia University\n\n- \"Family,\" Yifan Sun, The Polish National Film, Television and Theatre School, Lodz\n\n- \"Miller & Son,\" Asher Jelinsky, American Film Institute\n\n- \"The Chef,\" Hao Zheng, American Film Institute\n\n- \"Tree #3,\" Omer Ben-Shachar, American Film Institute\n\n- \"Bonobo,\" Zoel Aeschbacher, Ecole Cantonale d'Art de Lausanne (ECAL)\n\n- \"Dog Eat Dog,\" Rikke Gregersen, Westerdals Kristiania University College\n\n- \"November 1st,\" Charlie Manton, National Film and Television School", "description": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.
