Pedestrians look both ways before crossing bike lanes and jaywalk far less frequently than they do in most American cities.\n\nLast summer, Berlin passed legislation mandating the city spend \u20ac51 million (about $56 million) per year on bike infrastructure. By 2025, Berlin wants one-third of all intra-city travel to be done on bike.\n\nMeanwhile, in New York City, cyclist fatalities have spiked, prompting the city to boost spending on bike infrastructure to $58 million over the next five years, about 20% of what Berlin spends annually.\n\nWhile Berlin's bike infrastructure is far superior to New York's, as bike traffic grows, Germans are quick to say it's far from perfect. Other smaller German cities are known for being even more bike-friendly. And some other European metropolises, like Copenhagen and Amsterdam, are even better places to cycle.\n\nHere's what my bicycle commute looks like in Berlin:", "description": "As a New Yorker living in Berlin, I can say definitively: biking in Berlin is a breeze compared to New York City.", "authors": ["Eliza Relman"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d912bef2e22af3b3c1fab56?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
