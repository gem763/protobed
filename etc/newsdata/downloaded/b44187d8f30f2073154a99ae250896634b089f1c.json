Sometimes they\u2019ll be from our own writers and photographers, often we\u2019ll highlight the work of others, but no matter what, you\u2019ll now be able to spend less time trying to get that iconic shot, and more enjoying the place you\u2019re visiting. (For last month\u2019s iteration on Paris, click here. For Mexico City, click here.) The list is by no means exhaustive, but it\u2019s certainly a great place to start.\n\nThe Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Maria Luisa e Oscar Americano's collection of antique colonial era furniture may not be the mid-century fantasy you were hoping to find inside, but the lush landscaping around the property and iconic house make for great photography.\n\nWhile the status of visitors going up to the top of the Edificio Martinelli (which is totally different from what you see on the street) is up in the air.

In many ways, they'd be better off heading to the Mosteiro de S\u00e3o Bento with geometric pattern-heavy Romanesque interior.\n\nWhile I usually try to avoid including drone photography on these lists (not all of us have access), I didn't bring my phone or camera the night I wandered the Minhoc\u00e3o, the highway that is transformed into a pedestrian-only walkway at night and all-day Sunday. And this photographer captures the eerie beauty of the space in the middle of this gigantic metropolis.\n\nWhile the view from the top of the Edificio Martinelli is truly spectacular, the early 20th century skyscraper is also beautiful from the street.\n\nIn case you haven't realized yet, Lina Bo Bardi is a big deal. And perhaps her greatest work (along with MASP, the city's art museum) is the complex she designed for Sesc Pompeia, the culture and leisure center in the city.\n\nThe other giant of architecture in S\u00e3o Paulo is Paulo Mendes da Rocha. His conscientious redesign of the Pinacoteca do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (the other major art museum in the city) that combined the historic with modern is stunning.", "description": "From lush house museums to the city's famed concrete wonders, a list to get you started in one of our favorite cities.", "authors": ["William O Connor", "Travel Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567387335/190830-O_Connor-IG-tease_eqzpj9"}
