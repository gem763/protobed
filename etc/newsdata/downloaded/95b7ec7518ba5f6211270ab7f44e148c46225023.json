The other two dissenters, Boston\u2019s Eric Rosengren and Kansas City\u2019s Esther George, preferred no rate change at all, underscoring the widening gap in Fed views on where to take monetary policy.\n\nFile Photo: The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's President and CEO Eric S.

REUTERS/Keith Bedford/File Photo More\n\nThe Federal Reserve has now cut by 25 basis points in back-to-back meetings.\n\nTwo reasons for a cut \u2014 trade and inflation\n\nBullard cited two key reasons for supporting a 50 basis point cut instead: trade and inflation.\n\nOn trade, Bullard appeared to see the impacts of rising tariffs as a more substantial risk to the U.S. economy, saying that U.S. manufacturing \u201calready appears in recession.\u201d Bullard also pointed to bond market signals flashing concerns over a recession.\n\n\u201c[T]he yield curve is inverted, and our policy rate remains above government bond yields for nearly every country in the G-7,\u201d Bullard wrote.\n\nOn inflation, Bullard cast doubt on the effectiveness of only a 25 basis point cut in July. He expressed worry that inflation readings continue to run below the Fed\u2019s 2% target despite the July cut and the high expectations for the 25 basis point cut this week. The Bureau of Economic Analysis\u2019s most recent reading on core personal consumption expenditures (the Fed\u2019s preferred measure, which strips out food and energy) showed inflation of 1.6% in the month of July.\n\nBullard said a 50 basis point cut would spur a \u201cmore rapid return\u201d of inflation and provide insurance for an \u201ceconomy subject to elevated downside risks.\u201d His dissent was not a surprise; Bullard had publicly called for a 50 basis point cut prior to the meeting.\n\n\u2018A time of difficult judgments\u2019\n\nFacing a record number of dissents in the Wednesday meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the diverging views and the challenges of corralling differing recommendations on policy.\n\n\u201cThis is a time of difficult judgments and, as you can see, disparate perspectives,\u201d Powell said Wednesday. \u201cI really do think that\u2019s nothing but healthy.\u201d\n\nBullard said he still has confidence that the Federal Open Market Committee will \u201crespond accordingly\u201d to economic developments. Rosengren and George have yet to comment on their decisions to dissent, but Rosengren could elaborate on his decision in a public appearance in New York scheduled for Friday morning.\n\nBrian Cheung is a reporter covering the banking industry and the intersection of finance and policy for Yahoo Finance.
