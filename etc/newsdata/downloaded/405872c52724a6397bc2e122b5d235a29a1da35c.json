This marks a return to the normal precrisis practice of allowing the Fed\u2019s balance sheet to grow in line with the broader economy.\n\nA decision to do so also wouldn\u2019t on its own fix recent cash shortages in money markets. The New York Fed has moved to inject up to $75 billion in those markets daily since Tuesday to help pull down interest rates and announced it will do so again on Friday.\n\nFed officials didn\u2019t decide the matter this week, instead preferring to study how the financial system is digesting their five-year effort to drain reservoirs of cash to reverse their crisis-era stimulus.\n\nAnalysts at Evercore ISI expect the Fed will need to buy $8 billion to $14 billion in Treasurys every month to prevent bank deposits, known as reserves, from declining; that is on top of around $35 billion in Treasurys it is buying to replace retiring bonds and mortgage-backed securities.\n\nCentral bank officials said this spring that they would stop shrinking their Treasury holdings, a decision that took effect last month. But they never said when they would allow their holdings to grow again.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s balance sheet is composed of $3.8 trillion in assets\u2014primarily Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities\u2014and liabilities, including the reserves that were created to purchase the assets.\n\nThe Fed stopped buying bonds to spur the economy in 2014 and began slowly shrinking the holdings in 2017 to reduce the stimulus, which drained reserves from the system. Reserves have fallen to less than $1.4 trillion from a high of $2.8 trillion in 2014.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet should grow to keep up with demand for the Fed\u2019s liabilities, which include currency in circulation and the Treasury\u2019s general financing account.\n\nThe amount of currency in circulation has grown to $1.7 trillion from less than $800 billion in 2007. During periods when the Fed has held its balance sheet steady, reserves decline if the Fed\u2019s other liabilities rise, removing cash from markets.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s balance sheet doubled between 1994 and 2007\u2014well before it started its bond-buying stimulus programs, sometimes called quantitative easing, or QE.\n\n\u201cBy expanding its balance sheet, the Fed would simply accommodate the market demand for liquidity, not provide excess liquidity, which is a characteristic implicit in QE,\u201d said Roberto Perli, an analyst at Cornerstone Macro, in a note to clients Tuesday.\n\nThe decision to resume growth of the balance sheet isn\u2019t a big surprise. Several Fed officials said earlier this year they didn\u2019t want to reduce reserves to levels that might fuel volatility in short-term money markets. A seasonal cash crunch on Monday, however, did just that.\n\nCorporate tax payments and settlements of government bond sales resulted in a large transfer of cash from the banking system to the Treasury, fueling a spike in overnight lending rates, including the Fed\u2019s benchmark federal-funds rate.\n\nThe fed-funds rate traded at 2.3% on Tuesday, according to the New York Fed, rising above the central bank\u2019s target range between 2% and 2.25%.\n\nSeparately, the Fed lowered the range by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday to cushion the economy against risks from trade policy uncertainty and slowing global growth.\n\nTuesday\u2019s rate jumps raise the possibility the Fed misjudged the appropriate level of reserves or that broader plumbing issues are interfering with the ability of banks and other broker-dealers to move cash, which could require a larger volume of reserves to keep markets running smoothly.\n\nDetermining when to stop the decline in reserves \u201cis probably more art than science,\u201d said Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren in an interview earlier this year.\n\nWhen it comes to determining the right point to stabilize reserves, \u201cwe\u2019ve always said that the level is uncertain,\u201d Mr. Powell said Wednesday. \u201cI think we\u2019ll learn quite a lot in the next six weeks.\u201d\n\nFed officials face other thorny questions after that, including whether to change the mix of the Treasury securities they are purchasing and whether to become more involved in money markets by creating a new standing facility that would reduce volatility in participants\u2019 demand for cash.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com", "description": "The central bank will study whether to increase its holdings of Treasury securities carefully before approving any action at its Oct. 29-30 meeting.", "authors": ["Nick Timiraos", "Nick.Timiraos Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108830/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
