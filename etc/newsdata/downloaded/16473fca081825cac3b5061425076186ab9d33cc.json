He has his own coalition to manage, as we saw with the pre-emptive letter from 26 Labour MPs opposed to the policy shift.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThey are right to be concerned, because the policy has shifted. Labour is now in favour of a public vote on any deal to take the UK out of the EU. Given that parliament is almost certain to prevent a new prime minister taking the UK out of the EU without a deal, this means that the official opposition favours a public vote on any likely Brexit.\n\nDeep textual analysis might suggest a \u201cpublic vote\u201d could include a general election, but what is more significant is that Mr Corbyn is now open to the possibility of a vote without having to go through the hoops of trying to force a general election first.\n\nEqually significant is that Labour policy now contains some clarity about what form a referendum should take: \u201cA ballot paper would need to contain real choices for both Leave and Remain voters.\u201d It is not explicit, but it is unavoidable, that \u201cRemain\u201d would have to be an option on the ballot paper. It is also strongly implied that a no-deal Brexit would have to be an option, as that is what many Leave voters regard as a \u201creal\u201d choice.\n\nThe policy is silent on the possibility of a three-option \u201cpreferendum\u201d, with a Brexit deal being the third choice, which is probably sensible at this stage, and it goes on to say: \u201cThis will of course depend on parliament.\u201d This is a mere statement of fact \u2013 the kind of fact that seems to have long ceased to trouble most of the candidates for the Conservative leadership. It raises the awkward question of whether parliament would be prepared to put a no-deal option on the ballot paper, but at least Labour policy seems to be based in the reality of a hung parliament.\n\nThe next stage of Labour\u2019s slow progress towards a democratic, reality-based position on Brexit is to consult members, supporters and trade unionists on developing the policy. In this, The Independent suggests that the party needs to take seriously the case made by the 26 Labour MPs against a referendum. Their strongest argument is that the party pledged to \u201crespect the outcome of the 2016 referendum and negotiate Brexit\u201d.\n\nMr Corbyn needs to respond to that by saying, loud and clear, that the Brexit terms negotiated by the prime minister were rejected \u2013 regardless of the Labour position \u2013 by a significant number of Brexiteers themselves. They stopped the UK leaving the EU because they were not prepared to vote for the only possible way it could have been done.\n\nThe only way to break the deadlock of the Brexiteers\u2019 own making is to go back to the people and give them the Final Say.", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn is still on the fence, but it seems as though he is set to put a foot down on the side of a Final Say referendum on membership of the European Union.
