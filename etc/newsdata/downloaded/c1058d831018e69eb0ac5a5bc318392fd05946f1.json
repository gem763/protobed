The company also removed BackupHK, a separate app that served as a mirror of the HKmap.live app.\n\n\u2018PRESSURE\u2019\n\nMaya Wang, a senior China researcher with Human Rights Watch, said there could be legitimate concerns of misuse of apps but that the statement from Apple was \u201cdisingenuous\u201d because it did not make any reference to pressure from Beijing in the People\u2019s Daily commentary.\n\n\u201cGiven the context of how (Apple) has over the years removed apps and removed access to news particularly inside mainland China that the Chinese government doesn\u2019t want, I think that the removal of this particular app strikes me as another shameful incident in which a multinational company bends to Chinese government pressure,\u201d she said.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment on Wang\u2019s remarks.\n\nOn Twitter, an account believed to be owned by the HKmap.live app\u2019s developer said it disagreed with Apple\u2019s decision and that there was no evidence to support the Hong Kong police\u2019s claims that the app had been used in ambushes.\n\n\u201cThe majority of user review(s) in App Store ... suggest HKmap IMPROVED public safety, not the opposite,\u201d it said.\n\nApple's new iPhone 11 phones are displayed at the Apple Store in IFC, Central district, Hong Kong, China October 10, 2019, after Apple Inc on Wednesday removed an app that protestors in Hong Kong have used to track police movements from its app store.

Hong Kong police also had no immediate comment.\n\nSeparately, Apple removed the Quartz news app from its App Store in China because authorities said it violated local laws.\n\nQuartz Chief Executive Zach Seward told technology publication The Verge in a statement: \u201cWe abhor this kind of government censorship of the internet, and have great coverage of how to get around such bans around the world.\u201d\n\nANGER IN HONG KONG\n\nThe People\u2019s Daily newspaper on Tuesday blasted Apple, saying it did not have a sense of right and wrong, and ignored the truth. Making the app available on Apple\u2019s Hong Kong App Store at this time was \u201copening the door\u201d to violent protesters in the former British colony, the newspaper wrote.\n\nThe HKmap.live app was taken down from Apple\u2019s App Store globally on Wednesday but continued to work for users who had previously downloaded it in Hong Kong, Reuters found. A web version was also still viewable on iPhones.\n\nWord of its removal spread quickly in Hong Kong, where residents had been campaigning for months, in sometimes violent demonstrations, initially to protest a now-withdrawn extradition bill and now in a broader push for democratic rights.\n\n\u201cDoes the entire world have to suck up to the garbage Communist Party?\u201d one commentator, Yip Lou Jie, said in an online forum, LIHKG, used by protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nBut Simon Young, associate dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Hong Kong, said Apple seemed to have a case, given the circumstances.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like they are being responsible. To do nothing when it\u2019s being used for a specific purpose that actually facilitates these protests, to do nothing would be rather irresponsible,\u201d he said.\n\nApple\u2019s action has come amid a furor surrounding the U.S. National Basketball Association after a team official tweeted in support of the protests in Hong Kong, which led Chinese sponsors and partners to cut ties with the NBA.\n\nCathay Pacific Airways, Hong Kong\u2019s flagship carrier, has also felt the wrath of China\u2019s aviation regulator, which has called for the suspension of staff who have taken part in the protests or expressed support.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s rules and policies, apps that meet its standards to appear in the App Store have sometimes been removed after their release if they were found to facilitate illegal activity or threaten public safety.\n\nIn 2011, Apple modified its App Store to remove apps that listed locations for drunken driving checkpoints not previously published by law enforcement officials.", "description": "Apple Inc has removed an app that helped Hong Kong protesters track police movements, saying it was used to ambush law enforcement, following sharp criticism of the U.S. tech giant by a Chinese state newspaper for allowing the software.", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439309396&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990MA", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
