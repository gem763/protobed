Thick haze from fires had drifted to neighboring countries at the height of the dry season last month, triggering a diplomatic dispute between Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nSome schools which had reopened after air quality improved, shut again this week.\n\nAuthorities in Palembang, the provincial capital of South Sumatra, closed schools for three days from Monday with an extension if conditions did not improve, state news agency Antara reported.\n\nResidents were advised to wear masks when going out.\n\nAn aerial photograph taken on Monday showing Palembang engulfed in thick, yellow haze featured on the front page of the Jakarta Post newspaper on Tuesday.\n\nJambi, another city in Sumatra, has closed kindergartens for three days, Antara reported, citing a city government official.\n\n\"As a protective measure against smog, all students, teachers, and administrative employees are urged to wear face masks while they are in schools and on the way to and from schools,\" Jambi government spokesman Abu Bakar, was quoted as saying.\n\nFor months, Indonesia has deployed thousands of personnel to fight the fires, utilizing dozens of aircraft to conduct water bombing and cloud-seeding efforts to trigger rain.\n\nIndonesia's disaster agency last month said it expected the arrival of the rainy season - due at this time - to end the fires, which have affected more than 320,000 hectares of forests.\n\n(Reporting by Gayatri Suroyo; Editing by Karishma Singh)", "description": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia warned its citizens of more choking smoke from forest fires on Tuesday as several provinces closed schools due to worsening air quality.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
