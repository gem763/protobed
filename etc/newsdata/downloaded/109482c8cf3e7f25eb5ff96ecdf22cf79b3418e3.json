Goicoechea.\n\nRELATED: Deer Crashes Through Long Island Salon Window \u2014 See the Startling Video\n\nStates have regulations on how meat captured in one state can be brought into another state, but Nevada\u2019s Department of Wildlife Chief Game Warden Tyler Turnipseed illustrated how even the most well-meaning hunters can unassumingly help the spread of CWD in a testimony for the new law passed earlier this year, according to the Sun.\n\n\u201cSomeone, for instance \u2026 shoots a deer in Colorado that is infected with chronic wasting disease,\u201d Turnipseed explained. \u201cThey\u2019re back home to California, (and) realize they will be in violation of California\u2019s law (banning certain carcass parts), so they stop and dump out their butchered carcass alongside the freeway.\u201c\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve taken their meat, they\u2019re legal on that part, but they leave the spine or part of the head,\u201d he continued. \u201cA raven comes along, or the deer that migrate down off the Sonoma Range to the Humboldt River, and comes into contact with this carcass, and all of a sudden we\u2019ve got chronic wasting disease (in Nevada).\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Pet Deer Shot Dead in Front of Horrified Family\n\nUSA Today reported Monday that Iowa, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania have also issued warnings to hunters about CWD. In addition to 25 U.S. states, the disease has also been recorded in Canada, Norway and South Korea, according to the CWD Alliance.\n\nCWD is a death sentence for animals that contract it, and there is currently no vaccine. It can take up to two years before the animals begin to show symptoms.\n\nAlthough there is no current proof that CWD is harmful to humans, it is recommended that people not eat meat infected with CWD.", "description": "Nevada Taking Steps to Prevent 'Zombie' Deer Disease", "authors": ["Ashley Boucher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8NGqGZWtUPuOLPAEnq.nqA--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjU5MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/865f6f9a1f83c7e739aaa6b2bef22386", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
