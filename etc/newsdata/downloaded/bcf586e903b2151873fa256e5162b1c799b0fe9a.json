For now, at least, horniness has prevailed in Britain.\n\nThe plan \u201cconcerning age verification for online pornography\u201d will not be enacted, the country\u2019s digital secretary announced on Thursday. Instead, she said, the government will pursue more comprehensive reforms aimed at \u201cprotecting children from online harms.\u201d\n\nFrom the very beginning, there were obvious flaws in Part 3 of the Digital Economy Act 2017, which required pornographic websites to verify the ages of visitors in the UK or face serious penalties. Even the basic mechanism of verification was left up to individual sites, resulting in a patchwork of worrisome ID systems that required the horny to give their private information to third parties.\n\nIt took officials longer to see the error of their prudish ways. In April, a government white paper determined that the plan contributed to \u201ca fragmented regulatory environment,\u201d making it harder to protect vulnerable internet users.\n\nThat same month, a spokesperson for the body charged with enforcing the law admitted that \u201cdetermined teenagers will find ways to access pornography.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Britain\u2019s digital ministry told TechCrunch that they plan to incorporate measures protecting kids from porn-viewing in future, more wide-ranging regulation of internet companies.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult, however, to imagine any law aimed at checking the IDs of everyone who wants to see boobs online working correctly. As the people who actually study this stuff can tell you, porn, uh, finds a way.", "description": "After several years and numerous delays, the UK government has quietly scrapped a scheme to make web users verify their ages and identities when visiting porn sites.
