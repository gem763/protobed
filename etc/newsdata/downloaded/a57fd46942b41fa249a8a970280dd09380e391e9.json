'Nobody ever talks about the victims. This poor girl's life has been ruined because they gave this guy another chance he didn't deserve.'\n\nCourt records show that it was Court Justice Craig Walker who set Johnson's bail at $6,000 the first time around. He has so far refused to state why he overruled the request for $225,000 bail.\n\n'We don't comment on these things,' Walker told The Post. 'I couldn't even tell you the facts of that case.'\n\nDefense lawyer Jay Schwitzman who is representing Johnson says his client 'maintains he is innocent and will fight the charges in court.'", "description": "Prosecutors asked for 17-year-old Tony Johnson, so have his bail set at $225,000.
