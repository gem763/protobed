There may have been enough bids to get to $1.04 billion - thanks to the retail offer and $200 million \"indication\" - but there were not the quality or quantity of bids to ensure Latitude a happy and safe market debut.\n\nThere was plenty of finger pointing on Wednesday, in the wake of the pulled deal, revealed by Street Talk.\n\nBankers were pointing to shareholders (KKR, Varde Partners and Deutsche Bank), shareholders were pointing to bankers, investors were pointing at management and the shareholders. Success has many fathers, as they say.\n\nWhat's clear is that there were plenty of people driving what ended up as a rushed run at the ASX-boards. It is understood the latest attempt started in the middle of the year when KKR, on behalf of the owners, invited Goldman Sachs to work on the narrative and early preparations, before the wider syndicate and lawyers were called in.\n\nFrom there, it was a speedy preparation.
