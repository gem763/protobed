The 58-year-old tenant of the farmhouse, an Austrian man, appeared before an examining judge on Thursday on similar charges and was ordered to be detained for two weeks.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with an exceptional situation in this case. These people may have lived with each other in the home since 2010, apart from society,\u201d police said in a statement.\n\nPolice said the group \u201cclaim to form a family\u201d, with the suspect arrested on Thursday as the father and the six young people \u2013 including one who raised the alarm after fleeing to a local pub \u2013 supposedly being his children.\n\n\u201cWe have reason to believe that the six people involved did not stay at the premises out of free will. We are investigating whether following a certain belief in life or faith has led to the living situation in which the people were found,\u201d the police statement said.\n\n\u201cThe situation encountered requires a careful approach whereby attention and care is given to the young adults found.\u201d\n\nThe family were discovered when the oldest son walked into a local bar in a confused state and raised concerns about the welfare of the others.\n\nThree other people who say they are the children of the 67-year-old man said they had left the family eight years ago, and had since heard no news of the others, in a statement reported by ANP news agency on Thursday.\n\nDutch media have said the family was \u201cwaiting for the end of time\u201d as part of a doomsday cult.\n\nLocal television station RTV Drenthe earlier said the Austrian man, identified only as Josef B, the father and the captive family were all part of South Korea\u2019s controversial Unification Church, dubbed \u201cMoonies\u201d after their late founder Sun Myung Moon.\n\nWim Koetsier, of the Universal Peace Federation, the name the church now goes by, confirmed that the father of the family was a member in the 1980s, before leaving for Germany where \u201cwe lost sight of him\u201d.\n\nHe said he believed the father \u201ctogether with someone else\u201d had since started their own group.\n\nJosef B, however, \u201cwas never a member\u201d, Koetsier told ANP.\n\nThe brother of Josef B separately said that the suspect had previously been in a cult after leaving military service, although he did not say which religious group.\n\n\u201cHe was in a sect. We\u2019ve had no contact with him for 10 years. I told him to get lost when he wanted me to become his financial guarantor,\u201d his brother Franz B told Kronen Zeitung newspaper.\n\nJosef B had twin daughters with a Japanese woman, Franz B added.\n\nHe had rented the farmhouse but did not live there, and ran a carpentry business in a nearby town.\n\nThe case has raised memories in Austria of a series of cases in which people were kept in secret rooms for years by sexual predators, including incest father Joseph Fritzl and Wolfgang Priklopil.\n\nPriklopil\u2019s victim Natascha Kampusch told Kronen Zeitung: \u201cIt\u2019s horrible, this case has reopened all my wounds.\n\n\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t surprise me. As we already knew, these kinds of terrible crimes don\u2019t only exist in Austria but across the world.\u201d", "description": "Man suspected of depriving people of their liberty and money laundering, police said", "authors": ["Afp In The Hague"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96b443db530c9cf05136eaec9fd984156b5513e3/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=77828f1465b02e063c8f282abcc3116c", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
