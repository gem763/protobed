Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.), left, and Bernie Sanders in New York City at Mr. Sanders\u2019s first major campaign rally since he suffered a heart attack earlier this month.\n\nLONG ISLAND CITY, N.Y.\u2014 Bernie Sanders is back on the campaign trail and looking to project confidence.\n\nStanding in front of what his campaign said was nearly 26,000 people here, Sen. Sanders (I., Vt.) said he was \u201cmore than ready to assume the office of president of United States\u201d following a heart attack Oct. 1.\n\nMr. Sanders and his campaign are hoping for a revival to tick up his sluggish poll numbers\u2014which show a notable lack of support among older voters\u2014following two weeks off the campaign trail that raised questions about the future of his bid. Aides and allies of Mr. Sanders said Saturday\u2019s event here, with the Queensboro Bridge in the background, is a sign of positive things to come.\n\nThe rally capped off a strong week back for Mr. Sanders, whose first public appearance was the debate Tuesday. Then fundraising numbers came out showing he had millions more dollars than his opponents. He also secured two major endorsements with progressive Democratic social-media stars New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez introduced Mr. Sanders Saturday.\n\n\u201cOvercoming adversity is built into the DNA of Bernie\u2019s campaign. We thrive in it,\u201d said Mike Casca, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders. (Mr. Sanders\u2019s long-shot bid against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 turned into a legitimate fight for the Democratic Party nomination.)\n\nThe Sanders campaign said nearly 26,000 people attended the rally on Saturday.

Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cBernie has shown a very quick rebound. He still has the same really aggressive, mental vitality that a lot of other candidates in the race haven\u2019t shown,\u201d said Katelin Penner, 19, a student at Wesleyan University, who coleads her university\u2019s group of Sanders supporters.\n\n\u201cThe only heart attack we should be talking about, is the one Wall Street is going to have when Bernie Sanders is president,\u201d said filmmaker Michael Moore, who spoke at the rally and endorsed Mr. Sanders Saturday.\n\nBut not everyone was as confident Mr. Sanders would win.\n\nMr. Sanders has remained stagnant in polls. Meanwhile, fellow progressive Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has risen, closing the gap with former Vice President Joe Biden, who has long been the front-runner.\n\nPat Maren, a 26-year-old financial analyst living in New York City, said he didn\u2019t see how Mr. Sanders would be able to make a comeback, even if his influence over the Democratic Party has been a victory on its own.\n\n\u201cYou have the gang here that are endorsing him, but that\u2019s not exactly broadening his base,\u201d said Mr. Maren. \u201cI think he\u2019s capped.\u201d\n\nAttendees at Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign rally on Saturday.

Mr. Biden had support from 17% of those surveyed under 50 and 42% of Democratic primary voters over.\n\nWhen voters\u2019 second choices were added into the poll, Mr. Sanders didn\u2019t do much better with older voters. September\u2019s poll followed trends in data consistent with polling done for The Wall Street Journal and NBC News throughout 2019.\n\nRepublican pollster Bill McInturff, who conducted this survey with the Democratic pollsters, said the data on older voters was devastating to Mr. Sanders and would be difficult to change because his name identification is already high.\n\n\u201cI believe that there\u2019s nothing in these current set of numbers that makes it look like he could be nominated by the Democratic Party,\u201d Mr. McInturff said. \u201cBut there\u2019s always an asterisk, which is weird stuff happens in Democratic primaries\u201d and Mr. Sanders has enough money and passionate supporters to remain in the race in case of an upset.\n\nMr. Sanders has nearly $34 million on hand, about $8 million ahead of Ms. Warren\u2019s nearly $26 million. He is $25 million ahead of Mr. Biden, who has just about $9 million on hand. He also has attracted over a million grass-roots donors.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), who is a co-chair of Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign, said Mr. Sanders simply needed to tell older, working class voters\u2014many of whom are currently supporting Mr. Biden\u2014that his economic record and policies are better for them.\n\n\u201cHe needs to share that Medicare for All plan that he\u2019s proposing is going to give seniors long-term care, is going to give them dental and vision, is really going to be something that is good for seniors,\u201d Mr. Khanna said.\n\nSome of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters say he is galvanizing a whole new section of the Democratic Party electorate. Photo: Natalie Keyssar for The Wall Street Journal\n\nBut some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters said he didn\u2019t need to focus on turning out traditional Democratic primary voters who weren\u2019t supporting him because he, with the help of allies of color like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar, was engaging a whole new section of the electorate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about mobilizing a sector of voters who have not traditionally been a part of the movement,\u201d said Honda Wang, 27, a Democratic Socialists of America member who works in sales and lives in Brooklyn.\n\n\u2014Aaron Zitner contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Eliza Collins at eliza.collins@wsj.com.", "description": "Sen.
