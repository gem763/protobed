Mananalu was launched by actor Jason Momoa, who played Aquaman, and Liquid Death was released to appeal to \u201cstraight-edge punks\u201d.\n\nEver and Ever says the brand is \u201ca love letter to aluminum\u201d, while British start-up CanO Water was founded by three friends in their 20s after seeing plastic waste on a Thai beach.\n\nBEER & WINE\n\nIn addition to the shift from plastic, cans have also been bolstered by moves from glass bottles. Craft beer firms like the ability to put bold graphics on cans and they also save on transport costs since trucks can carry about twice as many lightweight cans than glass bottles.\n\nSome wineries have also started using cans.", "description": "French food and drinks multinational Danone is the latest company shaking up the world's $19 billion bottled water industry by switching some of its plastic bottles, which pollute oceans, to aluminium cans.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
