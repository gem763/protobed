So far, the 18-year-olds have struggled to generate a lot of offense in the opening weeks of the season.\n\nKakko, selected second by the New York Rangers after New Jersey took Hughes at No. 1, broke through with his first NHL goal on Saturday. Hughes nearly got his first on Monday.\n\nNow, the two youngsters will get a close-up look at each other on Thursday night when the Rangers visit the Devils for the metropolitan-area teams\u2019 first matchup of the season.\n\nDespite Hughes\u2019 struggles getting on the scoresheet, Devils coach John Hynes likes the way the teenager is learning and working on improving his game.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really understanding how hard you need to compete in this game and how much puck battles matter, attention to detail when you don\u2019t have the puck, and he\u2019s making strides in those areas,\u201d Hynes said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a step away from really creating some pretty good offense.\u201d\n\nHall of Famer Wayne Gretzky, now part of the Oilers\u2019 front office, cautioned about the high expectations immediately placed on young players who come into the league as top draft picks. He pointed to Edmonton star Connor McDavid, who was a No. 1 pick in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder than people think,\u201d Gretzky said. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit more pressure on these young guys than people think. Connor\u2019s been in the league a few years, he\u2019s lived up to it. \u2026 Young Hughes is going to be a fine hockey player. I\u2019ve watched him play quite a bit. He\u2019s 18 years old, he\u2019s in the right situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just going to take him some time, he\u2019s going to get his feet wet, he\u2019s going to get some growing pains but all in all you can tell his skill level and his passion for the game.\u201d\n\nGretzky also talked about the adjustments a player like Hughes has to make as he adapts to the professional game and the higher level of competition.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re playing against men, you\u2019re playing against the best players in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, we had fun and we were pretty good but these kids today with the level of skill and size and speed, they\u2019re so much better than when we played. That\u2019s not a knock against us. That means the game is growing and getting better all the time.\u201d\n\nWith the Devils leading the Panthers 4-2 on Monday, Hughes had a chance to add to the lead. He got a bouncing puck on the left side of the goal, and batted it off the post and over the stick of goalie Sergei Bobrovsky, who was diving back, but the puck went along the goal line and hit the right post and stayed out.\n\nHughes, who had three goals and an assist in four preseason games, remained without a point in the regular season and New Jersey ended up squandering a three-goal lead in a 6-4 loss to Florida to fall to 0-4-2.\n\nTwo days earlier, Kakko got on the scoreboard with a nifty forehand-to-backhand move to give the Rangers an early lead in a 4-1 loss to Edmonton, New York\u2019s first loss after opening the season with two wins.\n\n\u201cIt was a special way for him to score,\u201d said linemate Ryan Strome, who set up Kakko on the rush. \u201cA great goal, a great move. Hopefully the floodgates are open for him. He\u2019s got all the tools to do it, so it should be fun to watch.\u201d\n\nRookies who have already stood out in the opening weeks of the season include:\n\n- Victor Olofsson, RW, Buffalo. The 24-year-old has five goals and two assists in six games and set an NHL record with his first seven goals all coming on the power play. He had two goals and two assists in six games last season. His record-setting goal got the Sabres started in a 4-0 win against Dallas on Monday that improved Buffalo to 5-0-1.\n\n- Cale Makar, D, Colorado. Selected No. 4 overall by the Avalanche in the 2017 draft, he has six assists in five games, with four coming on power-play goals. Makar, who will turn 21 on Oct. 30, has helped the Avalanche open the season with five wins for the franchise\u2019s best start since beginning with six wins in 2013-14.\n\n- Sam Lafferty, C, Pittsburgh. With the Penguins missing forwards Evgeni Malkin, Nick Bjugstad, Alex Galchenyuk and Bryan Rust, Lafferty has stepped up with three goals and two assists - all coming in the last two games, road wins against Minnesota and Winnipeg - to help push Pittsburgh to 4-2-0.\n\n- Ilya Mikheyev, RW, Toronto. The 25-year-old Russian, signed as a free agent in May, has two goals and three assists in seven games. Mikheyev had a sensational goal Saturday night against Detroit as he drew Jimmy Howard out far from the crease, went to his left and fired it into the wide-open goal.\n\n- Ilya Samsonov, G, Washington. After coming over from the KHL, Samsonov spent last season with Hershey of the AHL. As Braden Holtby\u2019s backup, the 22-year-old won his first two starts, limiting the Islanders and Stars to one goal each with a .961 save-percentage. In relief duty against Colorado on Monday, he gave up two goals on 21 shots and took his first loss.\n\nSTREAKING\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche have opened the season with five straight wins. \u2026 The Devils have started the season with six straight losses (0-4-2). \u2026 Buffalo\u2019s Carter Hutton, Nashville\u2019s Pekka Rinne and Colorado\u2019s Philipp Grubauer have won four straight starts to open the season, Carolina\u2019s Petr Mrazek and Boston\u2019s Tuukka have won their first three.\n\nSLUMPING\n\nMinnesota goalie Devan Dubnyk is 0-5-0 with a 4.44 goals-against average in five starts. \u2026 The Devils\u2019 Cory Schneider is 0-3-0 with a 4.08 GAA in four starts, and Los Angeles\u2019 Jonathan Quick is 0-3-0 with a 6.43 GAA in three starts.\n\nLEADERS\n\nGoals: James Neal (Edmonton), 8; Assists: John Carlson (Washington), Patrik Laine (Winnipeg) and Morgan Rielly (Toronto), 9; Points: Connor McDavid (Edmonton), Leon Draisaitl (Edmonton), Mark Scheifele (Winnipeg), and Laine, 12; Ice time: Brent Burns (San Jose), 26:32; Wins: Marc-Andre Fleury (Vegas), Carter Hutton (Buffalo), Philipp Grubauer (Colorado), Pekka Rinne (Nashville), and Frederik Andersen (Toronto), 4; Goals-Against Average: Alex Stalock (Minnesota), 0.71; Saves: Fleury, 202.\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n\nThe Boston Bruins visit the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Atlantic Division rivals\u2019 first matchup of the season, and the first of two meetings in four days. The Bruins knocked out the Maple Leafs in Game 7s in the postseason in each of the last two years.\n\n___\n\nFollow Vin Cherwoo at www.twitter.com/VinCherwooAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jack Hughes and Kaapo Kakko were the clear favorites all along to be the top two picks in this year's NHL draft.
