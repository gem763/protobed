We had a scan for her last year and she\u2019s fine.\u2019\n\nAfter her miscarriage, Elizabeth set up Speciallady, an organization dedicated to educating women and young girls on gynaecological conditions and menstrual hygiene.\n\nShe said: \u2018I always say that Speciallady is my second baby. I want to be the voice of the voiceless for every woman out there who is going through symptoms like what I went through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018My condition means that I am high risk of cervical cancer or ovarian cancer, so I decided I wanted to live out my dreams.\u2019\n\nShe also travels back to Ghana to work with women where talk of gynaecological issues can still be taboo.\n\nElizabeth with her daughter as a baby (Picture: Barcroft)\n\nShe said: \u2018As an African woman, a lot of mothers die needlessly or people think these conditions are witchcraft.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m now seeking Government agencies in Ghana to work with me now, I take sanitary towels and medical essentials in and talk to them about my experiences, and the response has been amazing.\n\n\u2018These conditions affect girls as young as nine or ten years old, and they keep it to themselves. And by the time they realize what\u2019s going on, it can be too late.\n\n\u2018Women shouldn\u2019t keep quiet. So my main focus is giving women that courage and that motivation they need for them to come out about their condition.\n\nDon\u2019t be quiet, don\u2019t keep it to yourself. Don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re the only one that\u2019s suffering. There are so many women out there in the same position.\u2019\n\nMORE: You could earn \u00a3100 to dress as Pennywise and scare your friends this Halloween\n\nMORE: Mum creates incredible under-the-stairs playhouse for under \u00a3100\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Elizabeth Amoaa has uterus didelphys and that means she has two vaginas, two cervixes and two wombs.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91175848_1571758642.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
