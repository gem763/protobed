The point to me, we are talking about now is not whether the game will take place on Sunday, that will be a purely meteorological issue. The issue will be if it can't take place then we're really, really pressing the point that we need to have to get this game delayed 24 hours later.'\n\nAnd Dodson confirmed the SRU are exploring legal options to ensure the game goes ahead.\n\nHe said: 'The first is and most important is that we look after the safety of the general public. The second thing is for World Rugby to just simply state that the game has to be cancelled goes against the whole sporting integrity of the tournament.\n\n'We have been preparing for this tournament now for four years, the guys have had over 100 days in camp, we've played games already and the fourth game in this particular case is pivotal.\n\nTV screens showed the path of the Super Typhoon as the tournament officials addressed issue\n\nSRU chiefs remain on a collision course with World Rugby over their Japan clash will take place\n\n'We've had consistent dialogue since the last three or four days around this with senior people at World Rugby, but World Rugby seem to be determined to stick to its plan that the match is either played on Sunday or indeed it is cancelled, and to have it cancelled and have our ability to progress from this group put at peril, we believe is absolutely unacceptable.\n\n'World Rugby is pointing us back to the participation agreement. We've had legal opinion - from a leading QC - that challenges World Rugby's interpretation.\n\n'We don't know that (it's too late) - we have to challenge it. But we should be talking about this from a rugby perspective, this is about the game and the rugby supporters across the world are absolutely astounded at this rigidity from World Rugby.\n\n'The common sense approach to this is to play the game 24 hours later on perfect safety where we can make sure that the pool stages are completed, and the sporting integrity of the tournament remains intact.'", "description": "SRU chief executive Mark Dodson says he will not allow Scotland to become the World Cup's 'collateral damage' as he vowed to fight off any moves to cancel Sunday's vital clash with Japan.", "authors": ["Andy Newport", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/09/19578108-0-image-a-18_1570781997353.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
