Nearby, there are dinosaurs' footprints!\n\nBut the main jewel is the Prometheus cave, with its breathtaking views of stalactites, stalagmites and underground rivers.\n\n\"We are in a spectacular spot here, at the heart of a labyrinth of caverns branching out for dozens of kilometres underground,\" said 'Postcards' reporter Claudio Rosmino.\n\n\"Just think, some of these rocks have taken up to 60 million years to form!\"\n\nToday, visitors to the Prometheus Cave Centre can enjoy a magnificent 1.2 km walk, but those who discovered this place, in 1984, reached it through a very narrow passage.\n\n\"We were literally in the mud up to our ears! When we arrived in this huge hall, this amazing underground system, we were bursting with happiness,\" remembered speleologist Amiran Jamrishvili.\n\n\"We could not wait to go out and share this with all the other speleologists!\"\n\nAnd no visit would be complete without a boat trip on an underground river in which the traveller can emerge from the magical cave - back into the outside world.", "description": "Natural treasures abound in these caverns, with the chance to see everything from underground rivers to dinosaurs' footprints nearby!", "authors": ["Claudio Rosmino"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/15/91/30/1000x563_cmsv2_67e41a46-7786-59a4-8dde-2d97803bad8d-3159130.jpg", "published_at": "2018-05-28"}
