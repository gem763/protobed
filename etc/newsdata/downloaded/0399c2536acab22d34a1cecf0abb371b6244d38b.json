Here's Mirror Football's team of the week...\n\nEderson (Manchester City)\n\nThe Brazilian produced two outstanding saves late in the day to ensure a clean sheet and a City victory in south London.\n\nHis finger-tip stop to deny Christian Benteke - tipping the Belgian\u2019s header onto the crossbar - was perhaps the best save of the season so far.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nJoao Cancelo (Manchester City)\n\nThe Portuguese international was given the nod at right-back for City at Selhurst Park and impressed as they returned to winning ways.\n\nCancelo, up against Wilf Zaha for large spells, produced a smart defensive display - winning more tackles than anyone else on the field - and offered an overlapping threat in attack also.\n\nChris Basham (Sheffield United)\n\nThe 31 year-old was the Blades\u2019 Mr. Versatile last season, operating wherever asked to by Chris Wilder.\n\nThis term he\u2019s made a spot on the right of the back three and was excellent in shackling Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on Monday night - as well as stepping into midfield and getting the Blades on the front foot.\n\n(Image: 2019 Getty Images)\n\nIbrahim Amadou (Norwich City)\n\nDaniel Farke\u2019s Canaries arrived at Bournemouth having failed to keep a clean sheet since returning to the Premier League.\n\nBut they managed to do just that on the south coast, keeping the Cherries quiet and Ibrahim Amadou was outstanding throughout; he made 10 interceptions and 12 clearances as they stood strong at the back.\n\nMarcos Alonso (Chelsea)\n\nThe Spaniard wasn\u2019t first choice when the season began but an injury to Emerson Palmieri has seen him get his spot back.\n\nAlways a fine attacking threat from deep, he score a well-struck winner to earn the Blues victory over Newcastle , while also helped nullify the threat of Miguel Almiron.\n\n(Image: 2019 Chelsea FC)\n\nJorginho (Chelsea)\n\nThe Italian midfielder isn\u2019t touching the ball as much under Frank Lampard as he did under Maurizio Sarri, but he remains vitally important, even as Chelsea \u2019s style changes.\n\nThe 27 year-old still made 101 passes on Saturday - his highest of the season, with a 93 per cent completion rate - with almost a quarter getting the Blues into the final third, as well as another five into the penalty area.\n\nAlways available to start moves and for teammates to bounce passes off, he was excellent.\n\nYouri Tielemans (Leicester City)\n\nThe Belgian creator has been an understated presence in the Foxes midfield so far this season - much of the focus being on James Maddison.\n\nBut the 22 year-old produced a classy display in the win over Burnley , scoring a fine winner and being the game\u2019s most decisive performer.\n\n(Image: 2019 Plumb Images)\n\nJohn Fleck (Sheffield United)\n\nThe Scotland international produced a fine display at the heart of midfield in the win over Arsenal .\n\nFleck stuck his foot in and got in Arsenal faces when necessary, but it was his use of the ball which stood out.\n\nHe dribbled smartly to ease pressure when necessary, kept play ticking over with intelligent passing and produced three key passes to create chances for his side.\n\nJack Grealish (Aston Villa)\n\nThe Villa skipper is really coming into his own after moving further forwards and he was a class apart in the 2-1 win over Brighton on Saturday.\n\nScore one, made another, and provided a cool head when those around him had grown frustrated by the resistance of the 10-man Seagulls.\n\nTheo Walcott (Everton)\n\nNow 30, Walcott has been in and out of the Toffees side this season, but when Marco Silva desperately needed a performance from his players, the ex-Arsenal man stepped up.\n\nOperating on the right wing, he produced an all-action display, claiming an assist, hitting the bar with a terrific long range effort, winning tackles in his own defensive third and having seven shots himself - while giving Arthur Masuaku a torrid time all afternoon.\n\nMarcus Rashford (Manchester United)\n\nAfter a pretty anonymous display against Newcastle last time for the Red Devils, Rashford appeared to be a man rejuvenated following the international break.\n\nScored a fine poacher\u2019s goal to give United the lead - his movement to lose Joel Matip was brilliant - and led the line well throughout.", "description": "Liverpool dropped points for the first time this season, allowing Manchester City to close the gap at the top", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters", "Chelsea Fc", "Plumb Images", "Offside Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20661223.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Liverpool-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
