Translated into the context of Brexit, this duty to \u201cdo no harm\u201d guaranteed that there would be no rollback of public health protections and standards now or in the future.\n\nIn a letter in the Guardian (21 April 2018), the FPH and others welcomed government reassurances that the public\u2019s health would be protected as we left the EU. We noted, though, that ministers could only speak for the government of the time.\n\nWe, the undersigned, express concern over the increasing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit and the risk this poses to public health. We have sought to mitigate the very real risk of Brexit exacerbating the devastating consequences of health inequalities, and are concerned about the impact that a no-deal Brexit would have on the public health of all four nations of the United Kingdom, including placing at risk the Good Friday agreement and the peace and stability it has brought to Ireland.\n\nBrexit is proceeding at a time when the long-term improvement in life expectancy has slowed and, for some age groups, gone into reverse, while the most vulnerable in our population face growing insecurity of income, employment and even food. We believe that all of these would be exacerbated by a no-deal Brexit.\n\nWe now look to the current government to:\n\n\u2022 Confirm its continued commitment to public health protections and standards as Britain leaves the EU, recognising that leaving without a deal is incompatible with its commitment to \u201cdo no harm\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Publish all assessments it has undertaken of the impact of different Brexit scenarios on health.\n\n\u2022 Establish a system for monitoring any impacts of Brexit on health going forward.\n\nProf Maggie Rae President, Faculty of Public Health\n\nDr Peter English Chair, BMA public health medicine committee\n\nAlison Cox Director of cancer prevention, Cancer Research UK\n\nPaul Farmer CEO, Mind\n\nChris Askew CEO, Diabetes UK\n\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard President, Royal College of General Practitioners\n\nShirley Cramer CEO, Royal Society of Public Health\n\nProf Jo Martin President, Royal College of Pathologists\n\nMichael Burdon President, Royal College of Ophthalmologists\n\nProf Michael Griffin President, Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh\n\nProf Jackie Taylor President, Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow\n\nGil Walton CEO, Royal College of Midwives\n\nDr Margaret Stark President, Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine\n\nDr Asha Kasliwal President, Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare\n\nDr Andrew Fraser Chair, Scottish Directors of Public Health\n\nProf Martin McKee Past president, European Public Health Association\n\nAndy Burman CEO, British Dietetic Association\n\nSharon White CEO, School and Public Health Nurses Association\n\nProf Hazel Inskip President, Society of Social Medicine\n\nProf Tamara Hervey Professor of law, Sheffield University\n\nAnne Godfrey CEO, Chartered Institute of Environmental Health\n\nKatherine Severi CEO, Institute of Alcohol Studies\n\nPamela Healy CEO, British Liver Trust\n\nPaul Bristow Acting CEO, Kidney Care UK\n\nSarah Hughes CEO, Centre for Mental Health\n\nKath Dalmeny CEO, Sustain\n\nJeremy Hughes CEO, Alzheimer\u2019s Society\n\nDeborah Arnott CEO, ASH\n\nSheila Duffy CEO, ASH Scotland\n\n\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n\n\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n\n\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?
