Iger said they made it clear to Lucas when they purchased the outlines that they would not be contractually obligated to use them. Lucas also agreed \u2015 \u201creluctantly\u201d \u2015 to act as a consultant on the new films.\n\nBut when the company\u2019s filmmakers finally met to discuss the new plot, Lucas was not happy.\n\n\u201cGeorge immediately got upset as they began to describe the plot and it dawned on him that we weren\u2019t using one of the stories he submitted during the negotiations,\u201d Iger wrote, adding:\n\nNow, in the first meeting with him about the future of Star Wars, George felt betrayed. And while this whole process would never have been easy for him, we\u2019d gotten off to an unnecessarily rocky start.\n\nThat was Lucas\u2019 first reaction to the ideas, and it seems his view didn\u2019t change much. Iger also wrote that Lucas \u201cdidn\u2019t hide his disappointment\u201d when he saw a screening of 2015\u2032s \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d and complained it had \u201cnothing new.\u201d\n\nLucas stirred controversy around that time when he described how it felt to sell his characters to Disney.\n\n\u201cI sold them to the white slavers that takes these things, and ...,\u201d he said in an interview with Charlie Rose, then laughed and didn\u2019t finish the thought.\n\nHe also said the Disney execs \u201cweren\u2019t that keen\u201d to have him involved in the franchise after they bought it.\n\n\u201cAnd so I said, \u2018OK, I will go my way and I\u2019ll let them go their way.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nLucas later apologized for the \u201cwhite slavers\u201d comment and said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d with the \u201cexciting directions\u201d of the franchise.\n\nIn his new book, Iger did not detail the plot of the treatments they bought; however, Lucas told fellow filmmaker James Cameron that he had wanted to explore the \u201cmicrobiotic world\u201d of \u201cStar Wars.\u201d In the companion book to the AMC series \u201cJames Cameron\u2019s Story of Science Fiction,\u201d Lucas said:\n\nThere\u2019s this world of creatures that operate differently than we do. I call them the Whills. And the Whills are the ones who actually control the universe. They feed off the Force.\n\nLucas used the analogy of people as vehicles for the Whills to travel in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re vessels for them. And the conduit is the midi-chlorians,\u201d he said. \u201cThe midi-chlorians are the ones that communicate with the Whills. The Whills, in a general sense, they are the Force.\u201d\n\nLucas predicted that, if his idea had been made, \u201ca lot of the fans would have hated it.\u201d\n\n\u201cStar Wars\u201d star Mark Hamill also detailed what he heard from Lucas about future films: Luke would\u2019ve died in Episode IX after training Leia to become a Jedi, he told IGN last year.\n\n\u201cThe Ride of a Lifetime\u201d hits bookstore shelves today.", "description": "The iconic filmmaker had some bad feelings about Disney's \"Star Wars\" plans.", "authors": ["Overnight Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d89d24323000032006cdf3a.jpeg?cache=j7rbxjjkzl&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
