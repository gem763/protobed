Qu Dongyu became director general of the Food and Agriculture Organization this month, raising the number of Chinese nationals leading a U.N. specialized agency to four.\n\nThis trend is concerning, because China is not a benign force internationally. It is seeking to shift the values, programs and policies of the U.N. in ways that benefit Chinese priorities and ideology and that undermine the values and practices that have underpinned the international system for decades.\n\nA spate of recent news articles highlighting Chinese influence in the U.N. system commonly attributes Beijing\u2019s ascension to a U.S. \u201cretreat from international leadership\u201d under President Trump. Yet the expansion of Chinese influence in the U.N. system is not a new phenomenon nor is it solely attributable to the current U.S. administration.\n\nThe first Chinese national to lead a U.N. specialized agency was Margaret Chan, who took the reins at the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2007. Six years later, Li Yong became director-general of the U.N. Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). In 2015, Houlin Zhao became secretary-general of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and Fang Liu became secretary-general of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2015. These last three appointments \u2014 all of whom continue to lead their organizations \u2014 occurred under President Obama\u2019s watch.\n\nIn short, Chinese influence in the United Nations was rising well before Mr. Trump entered the Oval Office. Regardless of why this development is now receiving attention when it did not under the previous administration, it is a legitimate concern deserving notice and response.\n\nAs Chinese influence has grown, so has its ability to assert policies at odds with American interests or designed to blunt U.N. mechanisms deemed troublesome or problematic by China.\n\nFor instance, China has used its veto to block U.N. Security Council resolutions only 12 times since 1971, when the United Nations recognized the People\u2019s Republic of China as the official government. All but three of those vetoes occurred since 2007. Moreover, those vetoes were cast to protect repressive governments in Burma, Syria, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe from U.N. sanctions and condemnation for their abuses.\n\nSince 2013, China has become increasingly assertive in U.N. human-rights institutions, promoting \u201cits own interpretation of international norms and mechanisms\u201d according to a study by the Brookings Institution. Human Rights Watch has reported Chinese officials intimidating U.N. staff in violation of U.N. rules and harassing non-governmental organizations critical of Chinese policies.\n\nIn addition, China expects its nationals working in international organizations to advance Chinese interests and policies, even though international civil servants are supposed to be neutral and independent. In October 2018, China arrested the president of Interpol, Meng Hongwei, and charged him with abuse of power and refusing to \u201cfollow party decisions.\u201d\n\nKnowing the potential consequences of not following Beijing\u2019s orders, it\u2019s no wonder Fang Liu has used her leadership position at ICAO to impede Taiwanese efforts to attend ICAO meetings, despite Taiwan being a major air traffic hub.\n\nAs China becomes more powerful economically and militarily, its influence and presence in the United Nations will likewise grow. The U.S. cannot reverse this trend entirely, which is based on political and financial realities. Given China\u2019s priorities, however, the U.S. and like-minded nations cannot neglect the ramifications of this trend.\n\nThe U.S. must take strategic steps to ensure that Chinese influence is reasonably contained and its leadership restricted and channeled to the parts of the organization that do not directly undermine U.S. interests. This requires a broad, comprehensive, long-term strategy based on a detailed assessment of Chinese interests and tactics, promoting U.S. and like-minded leadership in key international organizations, promoting U.S. employment in international organizations, and applying U.S. pressure purposefully and judiciously.", "description": "Chinese influence is on the rise within the United Nations system.
