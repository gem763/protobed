However the objects of mediated communication - such as the smartphone - still have a cold interface that doesn't allow natural interaction and input,\" he wrote on a website about the project.\n\nTickling the skin on the back of the phone could release a laughing emoji in a message, for example, while a pinch could result in an expression of anger.\n\nImage copyright Marc Teyssier\n\nThe skin consists of two different forms of silicone layers, and electrodes attached to a hardware controller.\n\nMr Teyssier told New Scientist that getting the right balance of materials was difficult.\n\n\"The constraint was to develop something that was stretchable and that can also detect touch,\" he said.\n\nHe also said that make-up or paint could be used in order to \"increase anthropomorphism\".\n\nThe team also adapted it to fit other portable electronics, such as a smart watch or companion robot, or a laptop launchpad.\n\nImage copyright Marc Tessier\n\nOn social media it has been greeted with a degree of fascination and horror, with many agreeing that the Skin-On case was decidedly \"creepy\".\n\n\"This is profoundly wrong and I want one immediately,\" tweeted lecturer Belinda Barnet.\n\nThe research paper on \"Skin-On interfaces\" has been published at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology, taking place in Louisiana.", "description": "Researchers have designed a case that looks and feels like human skin, and can activate controls via touch.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6F69/production/_109312582_mediaitem109312581.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
