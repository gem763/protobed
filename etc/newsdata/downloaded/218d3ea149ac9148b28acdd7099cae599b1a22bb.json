Trump\u2019s approach has been a real shock to the system,\u201d says one official.\n\nTrump seems hell-bent on putting the WTO\u2019s appeals body \u2013 the enforcer of dispute settlements, which gives the organisation its teeth \u2013 into an induced coma. He\u2019s taken his beef with China directly to Beijing, in effect sidelining the WTO as the arbiter of trade grievances. And he\u2019s slapping tariffs on countries using a WTO procedure meant for times of war.\n\nIf the rules are being deliberately broken, what happens to the body that makes the rules?\n\n\u201cThis is an existential attack on the WTO,\u201d former Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo fulminated during one forum meeting in Geneva.\n\nThe World Trade Organisation is said to be facing an existential threat. Getty\n\n\u201cThe first decisive battle to prove that we care about the multilateral system will have to be fought in this house. Let us not allow the United States to destroy the WTO!\u201d The room burst into applause.\n\nThe fierce battle between Washington and Beijing is the main conflagration in Trump\u2019s trade wars, so it\u2019s easy to overlook the fact that the WTO is fighting fires on many other fronts too.\n\nThe damage from this to businesses large and small is slower and more insidious than from the stoush with Beijing. A gradual return to the law of the jungle would end up raising barriers and costs to any company with a stake in the global economy. And the WTO can\u2019t play fireman in the world trade system while it\u2019s getting burnt itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrading blows\n\nTrump \u2013 and to be fair, many WTO forum participants \u2013 see a different bogyman. In his view, it is China that is flouting the rules, not the US. It has kept its classification as a developing country, which affords concessional treatment on trade barriers. And the WTO sits limply by while China subsidises its state-owned enterprises and forces foreign investors to hand over technology.\n\nAs far as he's concerned, if the WTO isn\u2019t with him, it\u2019s against him. The WTO has gone from being an umpire to a target. And this has put the organisation very much on the defensive.\n\nChange is needed ... WTO director-general Roberto Azevedo at the public forum. Keystone\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of members, not all, recognise the importance of the system. But there are growing voices saying the system is not perfect. It needs to change, it needs to update itself to face the realities of the 21st century,\u201d admits WTO director-general Roberto Azevedo.\n\nThere are a host of separate issues that Trump has kicked into the limelight. The first, and most urgent, is the imminent demise of the Appellate Body, the WTO\u2019s appeals tribunal. The US has been vetoing the appointment of new judges, shrinking the bench to just three members. It takes three to make a quorum, and the terms of two of the judges expire on December 16. If the clock runs down, the court stops working.\n\nZedillo described the US actions as \u201ca vicious attack\u201d that \u201cif not properly addressed within the next few weeks will take the organisation to the point of practical irrelevance\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has sometimes made out that his main complaint is simply that the Appellate Body doesn\u2019t always bend to America\u2019s will. But more level heads acknowledge that the US does have specific gripes \u2013 and has nurtured them since well before Trump took office. The chief one is that the Appellate Body has styled itself into a proper court, generating case law and precedent. And it has overreached, and it has become unwieldy.\n\nHow to fix it? The Americans just aren\u2019t engaging with any of the attempts, including by Australia, to find a solution. There are ideas for ad-hoc arbitration to replace appeals, but this wouldn\u2019t have the sharp teeth of the dispute settlement system.\n\nSome wonder whether it might be possible to change the way it operates, change the legalistic culture that has developed. But there\u2019s no concrete proposal, and very little time.\n\nWeaponising economics\n\nThe second issue that\u2019s furrowing brows at the WTO is Trump\u2019s use of a national security clause to levy tariffs on products like steel and aluminium \u2013 and possibly, in future, cars.\n\n\u201cTraditionally we think of the WTO as dealing with economic and commercial questions. For security and political matters we have the UN. The WTO is supposed to depoliticise,\u201d says Joost Pauwelyn, a professor of law at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.\n\n\u201cToday security and economic issues have joined and people are talking about a new geo-economic order. If you asked President Trump he would say the two are completely intertwined \u2026 they are weaponising economic policy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe US looks set to stand its ground, and former Costa Rican trade minister Anabel Gonzalez doesn't like what she sees.\n\n\u201cIf one country uses the security exemption to roll back its commitments, others will maybe follow and the system would quickly unravel,\" she says.\n\nSeeing red on China\n\nThen there is the spillover from Trump\u2019s trade war with China. Trump, in a complaint recently echoed by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, is bothered by China\u2019s status as a developing country in the WTO. He says it\u2019s unfair, allowing a rich G20 nation access to trade concessions that should be available only to genuinely poor and vulnerable countries.\n\nBut China won\u2019t give up the developing-country tag easily. It sees itself as a leader of the developing world.\n\n\u201cThe developing country hat is very dear. It\u2019s political. Xi Jinping said we are a developing country now and for the foreseeable future,\u201d says Lu Xiankun, a Geneva-based trade expert.\n\nGeneva officials reckon there\u2019s a way out of this one. In the Trade Facilitation Agreement of 2017, India, Brazil and China voluntarily renounced the \u201cspecial consideration\u201d they\u2019d normally get as developing countries. There are other non-plenary initiatives of this kind on the go now where China will likely again not get special and differential treatment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump is also irate that China can subsidise its state-owned enterprises and can force technology transfer from foreign companies to Chinese ones. And he is frustrated that the WTO won\u2019t take action.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s economic system has evolved in profoundly problematic ways that the WTO rule book can\u2019t always address. Chinese officials are really ingenious in exploiting loopholes and weaknesses,\u201d says Paul Blustein, author of the recent book Schism: China, America and the Fracturing of the Global Trading System.\n\nThe trouble is that it\u2019s hard to get the evidence, and mounting a challenging takes a long time. Even if the West wins at the WTO, the Chinese companies may already have grabbed a dominant market position.\n\nBlustein reckons a coalition of countries should still try to bring a case against China, using a broad provision called \"nullification and impairment\", even though no specific rule has been broken. He says China will be more likely to make concessions in the context of a WTO case than in response to Trump\u2019s threats.\n\n\u201cThe WTO should be the chief policy instrument for dealing with China. The WTO\u2019s authority should be nurtured to the maximum extent,\" he says \u2013 but instead, Trump is undermining the organisation.\n\nAustralia's role\n\nOne of the charges the US levels at the WTO is that it\u2019s not delivering anything. The only major negotiation under way is on ending fisheries subsidies, and that is mired over an argument about who should chair the negotiations.\n\nThe less heralded bad boys of the WTO, India and South Africa, repeatedly use the consensus system to stymie progress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat, along with the issue of China\u2019s developing country status and its economic iconoclasm, is pushing the drive towards \u201cplurilateralism\u201d: a bunch of countries coming together to strike a deal on an issue, bypassing the gridlock of the main arena.\n\nAustralia has initiated talks on e-commerce involving 80 nations, including China and the US, which is aiming to put an agreement on the table by mid-2020. It's not a WTO negotiation, but is taking place in the building. There are also plurilateral discussions on investment facilitation, domestic services regulation, and on supporting small to medium enterprises.\n\nThe move to revive the WTO through energising the plurilateral track is being driven by committed countries like Australia, one top official says. But they still want more from us.\n\n\u201cThe middle-sized nations, the Netherlands and the Australias of this world, have to do more to keep this multilateral trading system in place \u2026 they have to develop the critical mass to replace the weight of the hegemon,\u201d says Manfred Elsig, a political scientist at Bern University.\n\nOther middle-sized nations will be watching with interest as the Morrison government conducts its audit of multilateral engagement \u2013 and hoping Australia doesn\u2019t step away from the table.
