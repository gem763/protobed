In 2015, left-wing parties fractured the vote between them and none made it over the required threshold to win seats. That surprise failure was a big reason that PiS was able to win an absolute majority in parliament \u2014 the first party to do so since 1989.\n\nPOLAND NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\n\u201cWe combined three main waves of the Polish left into one, and the common goal is to bring the Polish left back to the Polish parliament,\u201d said Krzysztof Gawkowski, a 39-year-old professor.\n\nActivists are trying to persuade hesitant voters that the union of the three parties is permanent and that they won't each go their own way once in parliament.\n\nGawkowski's own journey reflects the soul-searching of the left during its four-year exile from parliament. He had been a member of the SLD for 18 years before quitting to join Wiosna earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWhen I left for Wiosna, I had a feeling that SLD can\u2019t evolve on its own. Today the cooperation of Razem, Wiosna and the SLD gives new social potential, I feel that in the streets,\u201d he said.\n\nOld reds\n\nThe SLD used to be one of the country's dominant political forces \u2014 twice forming governments (including the one that led Poland into the EU in 2004). But a series of scandals saw the party shrink and then collapse. The party's traditional electorate \u2014 the millions of people who still had fond memories of communist Poland \u2014 began to die off.\n\nThe resulting rump party was consumed with arcane ideological battles and personality fights while conservatives took power. Center-right or right-wing parties have ruled Poland since 2005.\n\nBut four years of PiS governments have led to a revival of the left.\n\nMagda Biejat, the leader of the Razem party in Warsaw, says that there\u2019s a \u201cgenerational change\u201d between Lewica and the left Poles used to know.\n\n\u201cWe brought many new people on the lists ... we travelled a lot around Europe, we understand the left as modern, pro-democratic, European left,\u201d she said.\n\nThe SLD was traditionally not all that left-wing, despite its communist roots. It supported liberal economic reforms, led Poland to invade Iraq alongside the U.S., and had close relations with the Catholic Church.\n\n\u201cThe SLD made mistakes that we\u2019re not going to repeat,\u201d Biejat said. \u201cTimes have changed, and the perception of how the left should function has changed too. A part of this older generation learns from their mistakes and learns a bit from us.\u201d\n\nBut in the intervening years, a lot of what had been traditional socialist programs have been appropriated by PiS. The ruling party's generous social welfare programs, lowering of the retirement age and promises to dramatically boost the minimum wage are all classic left-wing ideas.\n\nGay rights\n\nThat's forcing the Left to hunt around for policies that PiS won't touch.\n\nBiejat mentions a secular state \u2014 anathema to PiS which has built a tight and mutually beneficial alliance with the conservative wing of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Left also espouses LGBT rights, loosening Poland's restrictive abortion law and decarbonization by 2035 \u2014 all stark differences from PiS's program. Like all opposition parties, it vows not to take away the social benefits handed out by PiS.\n\n\"PiS proposes a conservative welfare state, and Lewica proposes a modern welfare state,\" Gawkowski said.\n\nThose policies also serve to differentiate the Left from the Civic Coalition, which has Christian Democratic roots, and from the smaller conservative Polish People's Party.\n\nBut all those groupings may have to work together, depending on the outcome of Sunday's vote. If PiS doesn't win an outright majority on its own, the opposition parties have talked of forming an anti-PiS coalition government.\n\nIf that happens, it will be the left's first taste of power in over a decade \u2014 and unlike in 2015, they'll have a seat at the table.\n\n\u201cWe learned what are the limitations and what are the necessities of the political fight. We became the political party to get to the parliament and to change the country from there,\" said Biejat. \"And we managed to do it, while being faithful to our values.\u201d\n\nBut she adds that any broad coalition has to have a positive program and not simply be anti-PiS. \"We\u2019re not going to do it [the coalition] at all costs. It can\u2019t be another action of 'Everyone against PiS,\u2019 because there\u2019s little behind it. We have to have a feeling that we can deliver on our promises.\"", "description": "Left-wing parties have been out of power since 2005 \u2014 Sunday\u2019s vote might give them a seat at the table.", "authors": ["Zosia Wanat", "Agnieszka Kolakowska"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173745980-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
