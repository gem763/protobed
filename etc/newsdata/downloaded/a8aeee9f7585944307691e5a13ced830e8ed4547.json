REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the United States does not want to discuss the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei Technologies with China as the two biggest world economies try to end escalating trade tensions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a national security concern,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cHuawei is a big concern of our military, of our intelligence agencies, and we are not doing business with Huawei.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll see what happens with respect to China, but Huawei has been not a player that we want to discuss, (that) we want to talk about right now.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear whether Trump\u2019s comments indicated a change on whether he would be open to discussing the Chinese tech giant in trade talks with Beijing.\n\nThe U.S. president in the past has said he would be open to including Huawei in talks to reach a trade deal with Beijing. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this summer agreed the United States would ease restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and China would make unspecified purchases of U.S. farm products.\n\nThe United States placed Huawei on the Commerce Department\u2019s so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns. U.S. parts and components generally cannot be sold to those on the list without special licenses.", "description": "President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the United States does not want to discuss the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei Technologies with China as the two biggest world economies try to end escalating trade tensions.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426229235&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831SK"}
