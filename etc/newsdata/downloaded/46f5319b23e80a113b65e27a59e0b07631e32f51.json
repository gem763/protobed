Yes, I invented it\n\nI\u2019m sure many governments wish they had prevented it\n\nTheir national cash is how they keep control\n\nBut freedom to the people was my ultimate goal\n\nAm I a pseudonym? A group of men? It doesn\u2019t even matter\n\nI invented Bitcoin cause fiat is a disaster\n\nA man from Japan or a damn hologram?\n\nI\u2019m the reason open season on crypto began\n\nHAMILTON\n\nDoes anybody know what this crypto-thing means?\n\nTo me, sounds like the new Get Broke Quick scheme\n\nA bunch of fools from across the land\n\nInvesting in something they don\u2019t even understand\n\nBuying Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Cash\n\nIt\u2019s all gonna crash, and be gone in a flash\n\nAll this unsupported money\u2019s an irrational prank\n\nAnd I\u2019ll be laughing all the way to my National Bank\n\nSATOSHI\n\nHahahahahah, yeah dude, super funny\n\nAs if banks these days still helped people make money\n\nThe rich get richer and we follow like we\u2019re all sheep\n\nThe banks serve Wall Street, crypto serves all streets\n\nThe interest in crypto\u2019s on rapid ascent\n\nWhat\u2019s your current interest? Half a percent?\n\nI\u2019m sorry, the bank\u2019s gone past its peak\n\nBut I want info encrypted, not hacked and leaked\n\nHAMILTON\n\nIf this crypto system will be our salvation\n\nIt needs to be centralized, needs regulation\n\nIf our central database gets\u2026 how you say, \u201chacked?\u201d\n\nInsurance will just make a case to get your money back\n\n\u2018Cause in fact, it\u2019s tracked, and the money leaves a trail\n\nCentral currency is strong, cryptocurrency is frail\n\nUntraceable money \u2014 wow, so clever\n\nOne typo in your address? Now it\u2019s gone forever\n\nSATOSHI\n\nCrypto is frail? That\u2019s the essence of your lesson?\n\nYour money leaves a trail? Yeah, a trail to a recession\n\nA buncha rich white guys made this system\n\nWhy would they ever change this, when It\u2019s made them rich men!\n\nMovie moguls fought hard against the VCR\n\nHorse and buggy manufacturers all hated the car\n\nSo why would I take my advice from the banks?\n\nI don\u2019t need a bailout to survive. Thanks\n\nSATOSHI BACKUP SINGER:\n\nThe system is so broken\n\nWe need that crypto token\n\nHAMILTON BACKUP SINGER:\n\nThe system isn\u2019t broken\n\nCan we trust crypto tokens?\n\nHAMILTON:\n\n(It\u2019s gotta be)\n\nCentralized!\n\nSATOSHI:\n\nDecentralized!\n\nHAMILTON:\n\nCentralized!\n\nSATOSHI:\n\nDecentralized!\n\nHAMILTON:\n\nWe need control!\n\nSATOSHI:\n\nFree enterprise!\n\nHOST / DEBATE MODERATOR:\n\nBring me the facts\n\nPlease testify...\n\nSATOSHI\n\nFiat's the way a government controls the populace\n\nHAMILTON\n\nGovernment protects its people. All of this is obvious\n\nThey keep the peace, and so they KEEP control\n\nYou want us ruled by crypto-miners no one even knows\n\nSATOSHI\n\nOh, it\u2019s that \"Strong Central Government\" bit again\n\nThey protect people, but only their citizens\n\nCrypto has no borders, it's a true global currency\n\nAnd censorship resistance for those who need it urgently\n\nHAMILTON\n\nBanks earn trust by assuming liability\n\nYou know a key, we know the customer explicitly\n\nWill the real Satoshi please stand up?\n\nNope, you\u2019ll still be hiding when crypto busts\n\nSATOSHI\n\nYou don\u2019t need to trust the people, you just need to trust the code\n\nEvery record\u2019s in the network, you\u2019re just one node\n\nAnd when you find a flaw, there\u2019s a software update\n\nNow try updating cash\u2026 go ahead, I\u2019ll wait\n\nHAMILTON\n\nWait? Cash works! You immediately pay\n\nCrypto's a far worse medium of exchange\n\nCan\u2019t bitcoin the dentist, can\u2019t bitcoin my breakfast\n\nCan\u2019t even use bitcoin at bitcoin conventions\n\nSATOSHI\n\nNo currency starts with universal adoption\n\nIt takes time for places to make it an option\n\nPlus billions of people don\u2019t have bank accounts\n\nNo savings, no interest, no checks to bounce\n\nHAMILTON\n\nYou\u2019re saving the world? But what\u2019s the price you\u2019re paying?\n\nThe only change you\u2019re creating is climate change\n\nPower grids spiking all across the land\n\nOverheated, no one needs it, hope it all is banned\n\nSATOSHI\n\nFrom the king of paper currency, the hypocrisy!\n\nFor bills and forms in triplicates, you\u2019re killing all the trees\n\nDon\u2019t like my power usage? Stop targeting my rights\n\nI own my purchased power and the market sets the price\n\nHAMILTON\n\nIt\u2019s gonna get real dark if this is crypto\u2019s night\n\nThey use your currency for crimes, that\u2019s your kryptonite\n\nSATOSHI\n\nMost crime is done with Benjamins, not the blockchain\n\nThere\u2019s a reason most dollars carry traces of cocaine\n\nHAMILTON\n\nWhere\u2019s your proof of work? That\u2019s pure speculation\n\nThose darknet black markets need more regulation\n\nSATOSHI\n\nThe world\u2019s fulla currencies. And this one makes it worse?\n\n1 hundred eighty now, Bitcoin\u2019s a hundred-eighty-first\n\nHAMILTON\n\nIt\u2019s not the currency itself, it\u2019s the method, man\n\nYou can\u2019t build things that last without a central plan\n\nSATOSHI\n\nCrypto is a balance to the centralized model\n\nCause things fall apart. The center cannot hodl\n\nHAMILTON\n\nIf you end up having problems, I\u2019ll feel bad for you, son\n\nSATOSHI\n\nI\u2019ve got 99 problems but a Bit ain\u2019t one", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/videos/0/5d7/1360c4de94.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
