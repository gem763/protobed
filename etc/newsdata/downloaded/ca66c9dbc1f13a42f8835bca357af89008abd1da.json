Mega-cap companies announcing include Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices, General Electric, Facebook, Starbucks, Apple, Lyft, Chevron and Exxon Mobil.\n\nGoogle-parent Alphabet\u2019s report Monday and Facebook and Apple\u2019s reports on Wednesday will be focal points for investors. With ongoing trade uncertainty and regulatory scrutiny, market participants will be looking to see how the tech giants fared in the challenging environment.\n\n\u201cFollowing persistent downgrades (-10% over 12 months for the S&P 500), Q3 earnings are beating at a slightly above average historical rate. Muted reactions to misses but strong reactions to beats suggests the slowdown was well priced in,\u201d Deutsche Bank wrote in a note Thursday. \u201cIn the US, companies that missed have been punished less severely than is typical (-0.8pp vs -1.6pp), while companies that beat have outperformed robustly (+1.7pps +0.5pp historically).\u201d\n\nFOMC meeting\n\nIn addition, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will be kicking off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. The central bank is widely expected to slash short-term interest rates by 25 basis points to a target range between 1.50% to 1.75%. If expectations come to fruition, it would be the FOMC\u2019s third consecutive rate cut this year.\n\n\u201cWith the markets still fully pricing in another 25bp rate cut at next week\u2019s FOMC meeting and officials doing nothing to push back against those expectations, there is little point trying to deny that reality,\u201d Capital Economics wrote in a note Friday. \u201cAlthough we had previously suspected that the Fed would opt to leave rates unchanged next week, we now anticipate two more 25bp rate cuts this year \u2013 one next week and one in December.\u201d\n\nThe macroeconomic research firm also estimated that incoming economic data will show increased deterioration and the positive noise coming from the U.S. and China on trade negotiations will not change much for the Fed.\n\n\u201cWhile progress towards an agreement reduces the risks of future tariffs being introduced, it has not yet reversed any of the tariffs already in place, the latest wave of which have yet to fully feed through to economic activity and inflation,\u201d the firm said. \u201cFed officials are also concerned about the impact of trade uncertainty on business investment, which remains elevated.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell attends a panel at the Federal Reserve Board Building, Friday, Oct. 4, 2019, in Washington.

Excluding the effects of strikes, private employment would have risen a bit more than 100k, a pace just ever-so-slightly weaker with the pace of employment growth over the past three months.\u201d", "description": "It is gearing up to be a busy week with plenty of events with market-moving potential including the October jobs report, Q3 GDP, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and a deluge of earnings reports.", "authors": ["Heidi Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AElQxMe8QRq56lDRw330iA--~B/aD0yNTI3O3c9Mzc5MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/49b97050-f8cb-11e9-9ff9-f7f81b9ff2fc", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
