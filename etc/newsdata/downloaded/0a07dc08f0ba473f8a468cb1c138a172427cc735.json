Arizona Republic\n\nDravon Ames thought he would be dead if it weren't for the cameras.\n\nHe said he feared for his life and the safety of his family as Phoenix police allegedly pointed a gun in his face and threatened to shoot him during their May 27 encounter with police in an apartment complex parking lot.\n\nHe couldn't help his six-month pregnant fiancee, Iesha Harper, as he followed an officer's order to lie face down on the hot pavement. He thought at least his death would mean something when he saw bystanders filming, Ames told The Arizona Republic during the couple's first extended interview Monday.\n\n\"At least it will be recorded and we can make a difference,\" Ames said he was thinking at the time. \"We're alive to tell the story. We're alive to let people know that this is going on.\"\n\nIesha Harper and Dravon Ames pose with their daughters. (Photo: Courtesy of the family)\n\nThe family's lives have been a flurry of raw emotions since the first video was released to the media last week. Harper said they're still trying to heal \u2014 physically and emotionally \u2014 as they publicly fight for justice.\n\nThe apologies of Mayor Kate Gallego and Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams aren't enough, they said. Pulling the officer who pointed a gun in their faces off the street and onto desk duty isn't either, Harper said.\n\nShe wants to see Officer Christopher Meyer and the others involved fired.\n\n\"Behind the desk isn't good enough for me,\" Harper said. \"Sooner or later, they're going to be right back out on the streets. They should be fired. Their job is to protect and serve.\"\n\n'I was just trying to survive'\n\nThe first time Ames saw Meyer was when he knocked on the driver's side window of his car in the parking lot of an apartment near 36th and Roosevelt streets on May 27, Ames said.\n\nThey had just left the Family Dollar and were planning to drop one of the children off at the babysitters' when they heard the knock.\n\nBoth Ames and Harper said they were surprised to see him. They said they didn't know their 4-year-old daughter had stolen a doll from the store.\n\n\"The next thing I know, the officer's outside of the car, banging on the window and telling us he's going to shoot us in our face,\" Ames told The Republic.\n\nIn one of the videos, Meyer can be seen pointing a gun into the car. An officer can be heard saying, \"You're going to get f--king shot!\"\n\nAmes said he immediately wondered whether he would make it out of this situation alive. He said he tried to remain calm and comply with the officer's orders. He said he tried to do whatever it took to make sure their family made it out of this situation safely.\n\nAmes said he was pulled out of the car and thrown to the ground, facedown onto the hot pavement. An officer pushed a knee into his back as Ames told the officer repeatedly that he was being compliant and doing nothing wrong. He asked the officer to calm down.\n\n\"I was just trying to survive,\" Ames said. \"They could kill us and get away with it.\"\n\nAmes was handcuffed and then pulled up from the pavement, he said. Meyer then slammed Ames' head into the door and closed it, Ames said. He then slammed him against the door again and told Ames to spread his legs.\n\n\"When I tell you to do something you f--king do it,\" Meyer can be heard yelling in the video.\n\nMeyer kicked out Ames' legs, causing Ames to buckle forward slightly. Ames said the officer then hit him in the back and told him he could have shot him in the head in front of his kids.\n\n'All I did was fear for my life'\n\nAnother officer came to where Harper was seated in the front passenger seat. She said she told him she was unarmed, her daughters were in the car and they were afraid.\n\nThe video shows the officer's gun drawn as he opened the door. Harper stepped out of the car, holding her 1-year-old in her arm and clutching the hand of her 4-year-old.\n\nCLOSE A Phoenix couple is demanding $10 million from the city of Phoenix after they say officers used excessive force and threatened to shoot them. Submitted Video\n\nHarper handed her children off to a stranger when she was ordered to place her baby on the hot pavement. The child's arm was hurt in the struggle, according to Harper.\n\n\"All I did was fear for my life with every second that went on,\" she said.\n\nAmes was in the back of a police car for about an hour and Harper was in a different car for about 15 minutes.\n\nAmes said he was asked whether he'd stolen the car they were in. He said he told the officers he owned the car.\n\nThey were released, and neither Ames nor Harper was charged in connection with the shoplifting allegations. Ames was issued a citation for driving on a suspended license.\n\nAmes said he was shocked by the use of force and the lack of respect.\n\n\"I've seen people shoot up schools and walk up to a police car, and they were treated with better respect than my family was,\" Ames said.\n\nWhat do police say?\n\nThe 16-page report the Phoenix Police Department released last week differs from the family's narrative in several ways.\n\nPolice said another woman in the couple's vehicle tried to steal aluminum foil from the store, but she dropped it after she saw Officer Nicholas Welch and fled. She was later arrested on three misdemeanor warrants.\n\nThe report also contends Ames admitted to stealing underwear from the dollar store and threw it out of the car window as they fled. Ames denied the allegation.\n\nThere's no mention of a gun being pointed at the couple or any explicit threats in the report.\n\nCLOSE A bystander shot video of Phoenix police detaining an African-American couple in front of their children. Courtesy of Jarrett Maupin, USA TODAY Handout\n\nPolice said the family was combative and refused to follow officers' commands. At one point, officers thought Ames was reaching for a weapon, according to the report.\n\nBritt London, president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, said any judgment should be withheld until the internal investigation into the officers' conduct is completed.\n\n\"To hold court using only emotion, without obtaining facts, or ignoring facts, does not benefit our community,\" London said in a statement. \"Every day, Phoenix police officers interact with thousands of members of the public in neighborhoods across the city. In each instance, we do our best to protect residents, uphold the law, and keep families and our community safe.\"\n\n'It can happen to anybody'\n\nAmes and Harper have maintained the police report is full of lies and omissions.\n\nAttorney Sandra Slayton said during a media briefing Monday that the \"barbaric actions\" of the officers still aren't justified, even if everything written in the report were true.\n\nThe Rev. Jarrett Maupin, who represents the family, urged Gallego and Williams to change policy and fire Meyer and the other officers involved.\n\nThe Arizona chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-AZ) is also calling for the officers to be fired.\n\n\"This incident is just the latest in a disturbing trend emanating from Phoenix Police Department,\" Imraan Siddiqi, CAIR-AZ executive director, said in a statement. \"There are clearly systemic issues at play here, ones that will not be solved merely through an apology. Marginalized communities have continuously been the target of disproportionate force by police, therefore drastic steps need to be taken to ensure that this will not happen in the future.\"\n\nThe couple filed a notice of claim \u2014 a precursor to a lawsuit \u2014 last week demanding $10 million from the city.\n\nThe incident has drawn national attention, but Ames said it's only the most recent example of the department's extreme use of force. He referenced the police shootings of Edward Brown, Jacob Harris and Michelle Cusseaux \u2014 who Ames said was his cousin.\n\n\"For it to happen to the same family ... it just speaks to how bad this stuff is,\" Ames said. \"This probably could happen again. If nothing gets done, it probably will. It happened to the same family, so it can happen to anybody.\"\n\nGallego has announced a community meeting, where Williams will answer questions and address residents' concerns. The meeting will be at 6 p.m. Tuesday at Pilgrim Rest Baptist Church, 1401 E. Jefferson St.\n\nReach public safety reporter Bree Burkitt at bburkitt@republicmedia.com or at 602-444-8515.
