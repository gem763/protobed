It\u2019s understandable that some current or would-be collectors are holding back, waiting to see how values will develop. To help them sort out the present market realities, Penta spoke with experts at three leading classic-car auction houses.\n\nSenior specialist in classic cars at Bonhams\n\nBMW M1: \u201cJust 453 of them were made, styled by Italdesign\u2019s Giorgetto Giugiaro and with a race-tuned chassis and the hottest motor out of BMW,\u201d Minoff says. The M1 was built between 1978 and 1981, and doesn\u2019t come up for sale very often. In 2015, a pristine 1980 M1, resplendent in orange, was sold by Bonhams for $530,396 in Belgium. Minoff also likes the lightweight BMW 3.0 CSL coupe, introduced in 1972. \u201cThey\u2019re not quite blue chip, but they\u2019re great cars to tour in,\u201d he says.\n\nMercedes-Benz SL65 AMG Black Series: \u201cThere were very few made, just 375,\u201d Minoff says. \u201cThere were substantial changes made to the bodywork, with a lot of carbon fiber used. The market favors them over regular SL65s. Cars don\u2019t have to be old to be valuable.\u201d An example from 2009 (the first year of production) sold for $189,750 by Bonhams at the Greenwich Concours d\u2019Elegance in 2017. The cars were $300,000 new, so some depreciation has occurred.\n\nSaab 900 Turbo: \u201cThese are just quirky enough, and there aren\u2019t that many good ones still out there,\u201d Minoff says. \u201cCars from that era, the 1980s, are hot right now. Buyers who were kids in that period can now afford to buy the car they had on their bedroom wall back then. These early turbo cars have good performance and fit that demographic.\u201d The pre\u2013General Motors Saab 900 Turbo\u2014in coupe, convertible (after 1986), and four-door\u2014was introduced in 1979. It sold in that C900 form until 1994, with a facelift in 1987.

Given the global appeal of the F1 sport, with more than 500 million fans watching worldwide, even buyers outside the car-collecting hobby have taken an interest.\u201d An example is RM Sotheby\u2019s sale of the Michael Schumacher championship\u2013winning Ferrari F2001 for a record $7,504,000 at Sotheby\u2019s Contemporary Art Evening Sale in 2017. It was the most ever paid for a modern Formula 1 car at auction. \u201cBidders outside the car world are interested in F1 cars as art and as alternative investments, further expanding the market,\u201d Duff says.\n\nPorsche 959: \u201cThese are good buys right now,\u201d Duff says. \u201cTheir values are relatively flat at the moment, and have strong potential as mid- to long-term investments. There were fewer than 350 built and they offer great value compared with their contemporaries: iconic looks, crazy performance, and nowhere to go but up, in my opinion.\u201d The Porsche 959 was manufactured from 1986 to 1993, first as a rally car then as a road car, and was the fastest production vehicle in the world at the time. A 1987 Porsche 959 Komfort sold for $1,150,000 at an RM Sotheby\u2019s sale in Arizona in 2018.\n\nFerrari SA 599 Aperta: \u201cThis Ferrari is in a slightly lower value segment of the market,\u201d Duff says. \u201cAs a modern, high-performance Ferrari with a slightly softer appearance and more comfortable driving, the 599 Aperta has wide appeal. Add in the fact that just 80 were built worldwide, and there is certain to be room to grow.\u201d The SA Aperta, the roadster version of the 599, was introduced in 2010. It can go from zero to 62 miles per hour in 3.6 seconds, to 202 mph. The model honored the 80th anniversary of the coach builder Pininfarina. A 2011 Ferrari SA 599 Aperta sold for 933,125 euros (US$1.03 million) in Paris at an RM Sotheby\u2019s auction in February.\n\nA 1947 Buick Super 8 Custom convertible. Photograph by Lucas Scarfone\n\nCraig Jackson\n\nChairman and CEO at Barrett-Jackson Auction Company\n\nRestomods [restored and modified]: \u201cThese are instant collector cars, and there\u2019s a lot of growth in the market as baby boomer buyers have been eclipsed by Gen Xers and Millennials,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cYounger collectors are acquiring discretionary money, and they like the idea of cars that look old but have modern drivetrains.\u201d Barrett-Jackson sold a 1947 Buick Super 8 Custom convertible that looked mostly original\u2014but with a brand-new 580-horsepower engine and automatic transmission, plus brakes with quick-response stopping power and many other options not available in 1947\u2014for $412,500 in Palm Beach, Fla., earlier this year.\n\nPorsche 911 Turbo S: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a spike in these cars, especially with six-speed transmissions,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cPeople really love them. We\u2019re seeing prices in the low hundreds for the Turbo S, depending on mileage. You want to see the maintenance history, because if they\u2019re neglected it can get very expensive.\u201d The 381-horsepower 911 Turbo S, turned into a lightweight through the removal of such creature comforts as electric windows, power steering, and air conditioning, debuted in 1992, weighing just 2,822 pounds. In 1998, the Turbo S\u2014restricted to just 199 cars\u2014upped the ante with 430 horsepower. The horsepower race continued, but the cars are still relative bargains: A 2004 Porsche Turbo S convertible sold for $35,200 at a Barrett-Jackson auction in Connecticut in 2017.\n\nFord Bronco: \u201cSUVs are strong across the board,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cA first-generation Bronco, built between 1966 and 1977, was worth $36,000 in 2014; now it\u2019s more than $60,000. They sell well in stock form, and also as restomods. More than 30% of them go to Gen Xers.\u201d To illustrate the strength of the new SUV market, Jackson points to a beautiful, highly customized and Corvette-powered black 1971 K5 Blazer that sold for $220,000 at his Palm Beach auction in 2017. \u201cThere were two bidders, both wanting a pristine example of their first car,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cIt was perfectly restored, and the buyers appreciated the workmanship. We said we couldn\u2019t guarantee that it would go over $100,000, but it blew past that immediately.\u201d", "description": "In a slower market, these models still have value", "authors": ["Jim Motavalli"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-101384/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
