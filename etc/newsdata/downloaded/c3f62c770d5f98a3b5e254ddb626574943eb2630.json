The arraignment follows delays in posting security for their $1 million bonds, which will allow them to remain free while the court case continues. A criminal indictment unsealed on Oct. 10 alleges that Parnas, a U.S. citizen born in Ukraine, and Fruman, a U.S. citizen born in Belarus, schemed to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal banned campaign contributions from foreign donors to U.S. officials, including Trump-supporting candidates and political action committees. The indictment of Parnas and Fruman drew the attention of the House's presidential impeachment inquiries, which issued subpoenas to both men hours after their arrests at Dulles International Airport in Virginia earlier this month.\n\nRound 2 of PG&E power outages likely\n\nLess than two weeks after California's largest utility shut off power to 2 million residents due to wildfire concerns, Pacific Gas & Electric says it could again leave up to 500,000 people in the dark beginning Wednesday night.
