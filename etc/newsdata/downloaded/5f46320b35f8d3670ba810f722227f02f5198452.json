Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.) and his wife, Amanda, were the target of an NRCC tweet that has some in the GOP leadership cringing. | Mic Smith/AP Photo\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nA BREAK FROM IMPEACHMENT \u2026 TODAY\u2019S NRCC \u2026 A FEW WEEKS AGO, Democratic South Carolina Rep. JOE CUNNINGHAM\u2019S wife, Amanda, complained on Instagram that the couple\u2019s health care -- which Cunningham gets through the government -- did not cover \u201cmental-health therapy\u201d and marriage counseling. The Post and Courier wrote a story and so did the Free Beacon, which has the video\n\nTHE NRCC -- which, as the NYT pointed out, has punched frequently this cycle -- pounced. The NRCC initially jumped on Cunningham\u2019s video (which, to be fair, many Republicans thought was a bit tone-deaf, given the generous health benefits afforded to members of Congress).\n\nBUT THAT WASN\u2019T ENOUGH for the folks on First Street SE. NRCC staffers decided to rib Amanda Cunningham for apparently being in marriage counseling. After she posted on Instagram that she appreciated Beto O\u2019Rourke \u201cgetting bolder,\u201d the NRCC went to town. Their broadside had nothing to do with insurance.\n\n-- @NRCC, at 12:45 p.m. Thursday: \u201cLooks like Mrs. Cunningham likes a man who supports baseless impeachment\u2026wonder if this will come up in @RepCunningham's marriage counseling?\u201d The accompanying news release: \u201cWill impeachment be discussed in Cunningham\u2019s marriage counseling?\u201d\n\nCHRIS PACK, the spokesman for the NRCC, said Cunningham gave them the opening for this attack: \u201cA few weeks ago, multiple outlets ran a story about Joe Cunningham\u2019s wife publicly complaining that her husband\u2019s taxpayer-funded health care plan doesn\u2019t cover her marriage counseling. We referenced that tone deaf complaint when she publicly praised Beto\u2019s support of impeachment. She is the one who first publicly brought up these issues, not us. And they aren\u2019t going to help Cunningham win re-election in SC-01.\u201d\n\n-- FOR CONTEXT: It wasn\u2019t the Democrats who pointed this out to us -- it was Republicans. (More on that soon.) People in the GOP leadership cringed when we showed them this tweet.\n\nGood Friday morning.

The lawyer shared the officer\u2019s concerns with White House and Justice Department officials, following policy. Around the same time, the officer separately filed the whistle-blower complaint.\u201d NYT\n\n-- KNIVES OUT FOR DOJ \u2026 AP: \u201cHow the White House, DOJ learned about the whistleblower\u201d: \u201c[O]n Aug. 14, White House counsel John Eisenberg and a CIA official alerted the head of DOJ\u2019s national security division about the original complaint to the CIA.\n\n\u201cJohn Demers, who leads the national security division, went to the White House the next day to review materials associated with the call. He then alerted people within the Justice Department, but it was unclear specifically who he told.\n\n\u201cIn the following weeks, Demers had discussions with other Justice Department officials about how to handle the CIA complaint, according to the person familiar with the matter. It was during that period that the Justice Department also received a notification from the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general about a whistleblower complaint.\u201d AP\n\n-- HMM \u2026 NYT\u2019S PETER BAKER: \u201c[O]ther officials amplified the narrative on Thursday with details that were not in the complaint. For instance, they said, at one point an order was given to not distribute the reconstructed transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s call electronically, as would be typical. Instead, copies were printed out and hand delivered to a select group.\u201d NYT\n\nWAPO: \u201cEffort to shield Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian leader was part of broader secrecy effort,\u201d by Josh Dawsey and Carol Leonnig: \u201cThe White House has taken extraordinary steps over the past two years to block details of President Trump\u2019s phone calls with foreign leaders from becoming public, following embarrassing disclosures early in his administration that enraged the president and created a sense of paranoia among his top aides.\n\n\u201cThe number of aides allowed to listen on secure \u2018drop\u2019 lines was slashed. The list of government officials who could review a memo of the call\u2019s contents was culled. Fewer copies of transcripts went to agencies, and they were stamped with \u2018EYES ONLY DO NOT COPY.\u2019 And some officials who deliver call memos had to sign for the records to create a custody record if they were to leak, according to people familiar with the moves who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe them.\n\n\u201cAt one point in 2018, Defense Department officials were asked to send back transcripts of calls to the White House after Trump aides grew worried they could be disclosed, according to former senior administration officials.\u201d WaPo\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Members said they were often dismayed to learn of major news through tweets or in news accounts \u2014 and some vented about leaks from internal caucus meetings.\u201d POLITICO\n\nWAPO: \u201cDemocrats eye quick impeachment probe of Trump as freshmen push for focus on Ukraine,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis: \u201cHouse Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced investigation into the possible impeachment of President Trump, instructing the committees handling the probe to wrap up their findings within weeks in hopes of concluding before the holiday season.\n\n\u201cMultiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the \u2018need for speed,\u2019 as one aide put it, comes as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. \u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018Very few hearings, if any,\u2019 said a senior Democratic aide, who said the coming investigative work will largely take place in closed-door interviews. The aide spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.\u201d\n\n-- FOR DEMOCRATS, THERE ARE MANY WAYS impeachment can go sideways politically. One of them is impeaching TRUMP without a bunch of hearings. Let us preview how Republican groups like the NRCC and Congressional Leadership Fund will take that into campaign season in every competitive district in America: \u201cCongressman X wanted to impeach Donald Trump without holding hearings. Impeach the president? Without hearings? Congressman X is too extreme for us.\u201d\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY, via NYT\u2019s Nick Fandos: \u201c\u2018We should be focused and not overthink this,\u2019 said Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California and a member of the intelligence panel. \u2018The guy has copped to this. If you are running an investigation, it is usually made a lot easier when the person admits to the crime. You can cross a lot of witnesses off the list that you might otherwise talk to.\u2019\u201d NYT\n\nNYT\u2019S DAVID BROOKS, in a column arguing impeachment is wrong: \u201cThis is completely elitist. We\u2019re in the middle of an election campaign. If Democrats proceed with the impeachment process, it will happen amid candidate debates, primaries and caucuses. Elections give millions and millions of Americans a voice in selecting the president. This process gives 100 mostly millionaire senators a voice in selecting the president.\u201d NYT\n\nANOTHER ONE? -- \u201cTrump\u2019s Pick to Head ATF Is in Jeopardy,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Sadie Gurman and Michelle Hackman: \u201cThe confirmation of President Trump\u2019s pick to head the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is in jeopardy as some Republican senators expressed concern that he would restrict the rights of gun owners, people familiar with the matter said.\n\n\u201cChuck Canterbury, the head of the national Fraternal Order of Police, doesn\u2019t have enough Republican support to advance beyond the Senate Judiciary Committee, the people said, and a Thursday vote on his nomination was indefinitely postponed.\u201d WSJ\n\nTHE JUICE \u2026\n\n-- FROM NANCY COOK \u2026 OMB STAFF DEPARTURES: Two top communications and press officials are leaving the Office of Management and Budget. Wesley Denton, who served as a senior adviser, has left the agency to return to the Conservative Partnership Institute. Jacob Wood, OMB\u2019s deputy director for communications, is leaving the agency today to go to the Millennium Challenge Corporation as a strategic communications adviser.\n\nNATASHA KORECKI: \u201cHow Trump\u2019s Biden mania led him to the brink of impeachment\u201d: \u201cThe cascade of tweets began at 4:56 AM on May 1, starting with the president\u2019s criticism of the nation\u2019s largest firefighters union\u2019s endorsement of Joe Biden. Over the next two hours, more than 60 retweets bashing Biden and the firefighters\u2019 decision would follow from Donald Trump's Twitter account.\n\n\u201cThe burst of activity came during a three-month period that reveals an extraordinary preoccupation with his potential general election rival, and provides a window into Trump\u2019s thinking in the run-up to his fateful July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cAt home and abroad, on Twitter, at campaign rallies, in interviews and even from the White House lawn, Trump spent an inordinate amount of time deriding Biden and insisting that the former vice president could not be ahead of him in polls \u2014 despite the fact that Biden has led the president in general election match-ups in every major poll conducted in 2019.\u201d POLITICO\n\n2020 WATCH \u2026 BIDEN ON THURSDAY NIGHT, in San Marino, Calif., via the L.A. Times\u2019 Matt Pearce: \u201cAt a private fundraiser in San Marino, Calif., on Thursday afternoon, former Vice President Joe Biden accused President Trump of trying to \u2018hijack an election\u2019 by seeking help from Ukraine to investigate Biden\u2019s family. \u2018He\u2019d like to get foreign help to win elections,\u2019 Biden told a few dozen attendees, adding a chuckle. \u2026\n\n\u201cBiden also hit themes of economic equality. He criticized Milton Friedman\u2019s theory of shareholder primacy for corporations and told the well heeled audience, \u2018Folks, if you\u2019re looking for a tax cut, I\u2019m not your guy.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- \u201cAnxious Biden Allies May Unleash Super PAC,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin\n\nSUNDAY SO FAR \u2026\n\n\n\nFOX \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: Highlights of Chris Wallace\u2019s interview with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani from earlier this week.

Prosecutors agreed not to enforce the subpoena until two business days after either Oct. 7 or Judge Marrero rules whether to at least temporarily block the subpoena, whichever comes first. Mazars agreed to gather and prepare documents, and hand deliver a batch by 4 p.m. on the day the agreement expires.\u201d WSJ\n\nVALLEY TALK \u2026 NYT\u2019S KEVIN ROOSE: \u201cThe last time America watched an impeachment inquiry, it was largely an analog affair. When the House voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton in 1998, only one in four American homes had internet access. AOL and Yahoo were the biggest websites in the world, and \u2018tweet\u2019 was a sound birds made.\n\n\u201cIf the inquiry opened by House Democrats this week results in a formal impeachment of Mr. Trump, it will be the first of the social media era. In many ways, it is a made-for-the-internet event. The political stakes are high, the dramatic story unspools tidbit by tidbit and the stark us-versus-them dynamics provide plenty of fodder for emotionally charged social media brawls.\u201d NYT\n\n-- OXFORD STUDY: \u201cEvidence of organized social media manipulation campaigns which have taken place in 70 countries, up from 48 countries in 2018 and 28 countries in 2017.
