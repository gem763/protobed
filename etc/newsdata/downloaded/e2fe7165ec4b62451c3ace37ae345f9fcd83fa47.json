Because of that, it\u2019s been hard to imagine what a kabuki version of anime director Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s landmark movie would look like. Will it ditch the classical garb and makeup associated with kabuki for a full-on cosplay route, or perhaps go in the opposite direction, maintaining as much as it can of orthodox kabuki aesthetics while adding only the bare minimum of token nods to its Ghibli source material?\n\nBut now we\u2019ve finally got a sneak peek, and it looks like the kabuki Nausicaa, much like its titular heroine, is rejecting extremes and walking a path of balance.\n\nA newly released poster image for the production shows star Kikunosuke Onoe in costume as Nausicaa for the first time, dressed in an innovative kimono that incorporates cues from the Ghibli heroine\u2019s iconic crest-emblazoned blue dress. Meanwhile, Onoe\u2019s posture and pose suggest that the centuries-old dancing motions of traditional kabuki will still be on full display, in an effort to also satisfy audience members who are kabuki fans first, and Ghibli fans second.\n\nAlso appearing on the poster is Shichinosuke Nakamura as Kushana, Nausicaa\u2019s antagonist in the Ghibli film.\n\nWhile Nausicaa and Kushana are the only two characters to have been shown so far, there are many more to come, as the kabuki play, which opens Dec 6, will be the first-ever complete adaptation of Miyazaki\u2019s original Nausicaa manga and include characters who only appear in the story after the events of the anime. If the quality of these first two costumes is anything to go by, though, the production looks like it\u2019s going to be something special to see, even if Miyazaki himself is adamant about not lending the producers a hand.\n\nSource: Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind kabuki official website via Livedoor News/Sports Hochi via Hachima Kiko\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- New Laputa amulet actually responds when you incant the anime\u2019s magic spells\n\n-- Anime fans pick which Ghibli heroine they\u2019d like to have as a girlfriend\n\n-- Japanese men pick their favorite Studio Ghibli anime heroine \u3010Survey\u3011\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/23/heres-what-studio-ghibli-heroine-nausicaa-will-look-like-in-her-live-action-kabuki-play/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "Opening night is just six weeks away for the kabuki adaptation of \"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.\" As one of the most widely respected works of not just anime, but Japanese film in general, anticipation for the production is incredibly high, and so is the degree of difficulty for the play\u2019s\u2026", "authors": ["Bugle Boy Of Company B"], "top_image": "https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/e3/93/a73b87ef2fe265d96bab72bb1bc929f65894/nk-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
