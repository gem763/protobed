That\u2019s why I love them | James Colley Read more\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we wanted to do this conference \u2013 to bring people together to look at how [U2 has] really influenced society, culture and music over the last 40 years. It\u2019s actually been huge.\u201d\n\nThe conference is the brainchild of US literary academic Scott Calhoun. Three editions of the conference have run in the past \u2013 in 2009 and 2013 in the US, and last year in the pop band\u2019s home town of Dublin, Ireland.\n\nAustralian film director Richard Lowenstein, behind the recent Michael Hutchence documentary, Mystify, will be a special guest at the conference. A friend of both Hutchence and U2 frontman Bono, Lowenstein\u2019s association with U2 goes back to his little-known documentary, U2 Lovetown, following the band\u2019s lengthy 1989 Australian tour.\n\nThe U2 Conference will host screenings of both U2 Lovetown and Mystify, the latter of which includes an interview with Bono.\n\nIt will be a day without the band itself \u2013 U2\u2019s members are not expected to make an appearance at the conference, except perhaps in the form of indelible ink: in what promises to be a conference highlight, University of North Florida associate professor Beth Nabi will present the results of almost five years of international research documenting hundreds of U2 fan tattoos.\n\nWith conference attendance capped at 100 guests, Dinnen told Guardian Australia she hoped the Sydney event would attract a local audience who wanted to be part of the conversation around U2\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cWithin academia, pop music is a relatively new discipline,\u201d Dinnen said. \u201cBecause U2 were so big in America there was a lot of focus on the theological aspect [of their music] in the 80s.\u201d\n\n\u2018I have a carpet Take That stood on\u2019: meet the ultimate superfans Read more\n\nAcademics in U2 studies have since looked at the band as a cultural phenomenon and how they\u2019ve changed or influenced concert culture, but there hadn\u2019t been a lot of study into the musicology of the band\u2019s work, she said.\n\nThe Sydney resident and former music journalist had been a fan of U2 \u201csince the beginning\u201d. One of her earliest memories of the band was catching the music video for Gloria on TV in the early 1980s.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve evolved and changed. They\u2019ve been through so many different stages with their music,\u201d Dinnen said. \u201cThey could just rest on their laurels and write another Beautiful Day, but they seem to be constantly pushing the boundaries and looking for different ways of doing music.\u201d\n\nDinnen\u2019s research focus is on the influence of the Hebrew Bible in U2\u2019s music.\n\nThe Antipodean leg of U2\u2019s Joshua Tree tour starts in New Zealand on 8 November before making its way to Australia for shows in Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney and Perth. The U2 Conference: the Australian Edition will take place on 21 November at Studios 301 in Sydney.", "description": "Film director Richard Lowenstein, academics and fans to attend Sydney edition of the U2 Conference \u2013 with or without the band", "authors": ["Stephanie Convery"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c94c44d8564bfbc4fab6c6400e22fbc50938151/0_104_2832_1699/master/2832.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1741048c353855be6e668fe0868ee999", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
