Make no mistake about what's happening here: this is a rolling coup attempt, organized by elements of the intelligence community, particularly CIA and NSA, abetted by Obama-era holdovers in the understaffed Justice Department (Sally Yates, take a bow) and the lickspittles of the leftist media, all of whom have signed on with the \"Resistance\" in order to overturn the results of the November election.\n\nMike Flynn, a good man who saw the enemy clearly, and had the courage to name it, saw Russia not as an enemy but a geopolitical adversary with whom we could make common cause against Islam -- and who also vowed to shake up a complacent and malfeasant IC -- was its first scalp, and an object lesson to new CIA Director Mike Pompeo should he have any reformist notions. As for the media, having previously failed to take down Trump aides Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, Flynn was the next best thing; their joy today is unbounded.\n\nIs this what you thought you voted for in November? Is this how you thought American democracy worked? Is this the country you want to live in?\n\nWelcome to the Deep State, the democracy-sapping embeds at the heart of our democracy who have not taken the expulsion of the Permanent Bipartisan Fusion Party lightly. They realize that the Trump administration poses a mortal threat to their hegemony, and so have enlisted an army of Democrats, some Republicans, the \"neverTrumpumpkin\" conservative die-hards, leftist thugs, Black Lives Matter and anybody else they can blackmail, browbeat or enlist. They mean business.\n\nWe've come to a pretty pass when Wikileaks now makes more sense than the New York Times, the Washington Post and other Democrat mouthpieces and house organs. Or when fugitive Julian Assange, holed up in London at the sufferance of the Ecuadorian government, appears to have more insight, integrity and curiosity than the entire Beltway media:\n\nTrump's National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigns after destabilization campaign by US spies, Democrats, press https://t.co/vKlX1Tqek1 \u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) February 14, 2017\n\nWe're in the midst of a rapidly moving spy game here, adrift in the famous Wilderness of Mirrors, and with the major players switching -- or appearing to switch -- sides in a flash. The CIA has never forgiven Ronald Reagan for taking down the Soviets and spoiling its extremely cozy relationship with the KGB. The two agencies had long since worked out a modus vivendi, under which rules they both did their best to keep the Berlin Wall standing, Eastern Europe locked away, and the postwar status quo in operation; it was only when one side or the other broke protocol that civilians ever heard a thing about them, as when the KGB arrested American journalist Nick Daniloff for allegedly spying in Moscow in 1986:\n\nAug. 30 Nicholas S. Daniloff, correspondent for U.S. News & World Report, is detained in Moscow after being handed a package by a Soviet acquaintance containing two maps marked ''top secret.'' The arrest follows by one week the arrest in New York of Gennadi F. Zakharov, a Soviet employee of the United Nations, on charges of espionage.\n\nDaniloff was eventually freed and left the Soviet Union at the end of September. You can read more about him here.\n\nNow, up is down, black is white, and in is out. This is, of course, how you play the game, to keep everyone in a state of maximum confusion. So let's cut to Main Narrative, as retailed by the MSM, with timely encouragement from the CIA and Democrat operatives masquerading as journalists:\n\nTrump is unfit to be president. Plus, Hillary is unbeatable, so give up already.\n\nOops -- Trump wins.\n\nThe Russians stole the election.\n\nTrump is too cozy with the Russians.\n\nTrump's people are too cozy with the Russians.\n\nNo wonder the Russians stole the election for Trump.\n\nFlynn called the Russian ambassador -- and lied about it!\n\nThe coverup is always worse than the crime! Flynn must go!\n\nFlynn's gone -- but here comes the ghost of Howard Baker --\n\n\"What did the president know and when did he know it?\"\n\nTrump is doomed.\n\nEnter now the usual sycophants and deracinated old men, such as war hero John McCain, his lovely sidekick Lindsey Graham and various other useful idiots, adding their capon voices to the leftist choir: let freedom ring!\n\nSo what must Trump do now? First, complete his cabinet. Second, fire every fireable federal employee in the leak-prone agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency. Third, start taking operational security seriously. Fourth, assume everything you say will leak to the media and be spun as malevolently as possible. Fifth, trust nobody.\n\nFinally, fight back, with all the powers of the presidency. And take every friend you can get:\n\nDo you have official, secret, unreleased documents about how intelligence agencies attempt to penetrate elections? https://t.co/cLRcuIiQXz \u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) February 6, 2017\n\nBecause, if you don't, you're going to get a lot more of this:\n\nAct accordingly\n\nFollow me on Twitter @dkahanerules.\n\nFor more about the NSA and its little-known baby sister, the Central Security Service, please read my Devlin Trilogy, available here.", "description": "American democracy is in peril", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.pjmedia.com/michaelwalsh/user-content/43/files/2017/02/AP_17033757695237.sized-770x415xc.jpg", "published_at": "2017-02-14"}
