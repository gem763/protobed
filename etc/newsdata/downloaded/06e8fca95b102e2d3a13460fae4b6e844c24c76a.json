He is coming to the U.S. as my guest on November 13th. #ENDENDLESSWARS,\u201d he added, referring to Erdogan.\n\nTrump then went on to defend his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, a move that would pave the way for Turkey to launch a long-threatened offensive that many worry could crush the U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria. Trump said on Twitter that \u201cin no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCritics also worry that Trump\u2019s plan could result in the Islamic State regaining strength in the region.\n\nAD\n\nBut Trump insisted that his administration would continue to help the Kurds.\n\n\u201cTurkey already has a large Kurdish population and fully understands that while we only had 50 soldiers remaining in that section of Syria, and they have been removed, any unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe are helping the Kurds financially/weapons!\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The announcement comes amid bipartisan backlash over Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dqU1UIf7LfqOsphpkYQSTHh6M84=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HKM7PHHJ4AI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
