Economic impact will probably be felt across business sectors, including restaurants, transportation and grocery stores.\n\nInsurance for stores like supermarkets doesn\u2019t typically cover planned power outages, only outages caused by natural disasters like earthquakes, Ronald Fong, CEO of the California Grocers Association, told the Associated Press. The stores will have to eat those costs.\n\nPortions of wine country north of San Francisco, torched by wildfires in 2017, stayed dark for most of the day Wednesday and Thursday. The county\u2019s economic development board is preparing to study the local costs of the shutdown and will send out a survey to area businesses once power is restored.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of precedent for how to calculate the impact,\u201d said Lauren Cartwright, a board spokesperson.\n\nShe said the closest study the group could find was a 2011 report that measured the economic losses of a blackout in San Diego that affected 2m customers and cost the region $97m to $118m \u2013 including $12m to $18m in perishable food loss and $70m in lost productivity.\n\nOther experts vary in their estimates.\n\nMichael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy program at Stanford University and a member of the state commission on wildfire cost and recovery, calculated the shutdown could cost residential customers $65m. Factor in small commercial and industrial customers and the cost jumps to $2.5bn, he wrote.\n\nMichael Wara (@MichaelWWara) I think it makes sense to exclude large C&I customers bc the areas being blacked out are suburban/rural and also steep terrain. If one sums residential and small C&I losses, the total is $2.5 billion in outage costs. If one assumes only residential customer impact, $65 million.\n\n\n\nWara based his estimate on the Interruption Cost Estimate Calculator, a tool developed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the San Francisco software and consulting firm Nexant. He excluded large commercial and industrial customers because the areas blacked out are largely suburban, rural and in steep terrain.\n\nJesse Jenkins, a Princeton energy systems engineering professor, came up with slightly lower amount, based on an average amount of energy a household uses.\n\n\u201cCall it a cool billion,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nJesseJenkins (@JesseJenkins) Quick order of magnitude cost calc: if we assume 1 kW avg load per household, 800,000 households, 5 days outage, and $10,000/MWh cost of non-served energy (aka blackout), this could cost customers $960 million. Call it a cool billion. https://t.co/vNS2SWSFu9\n\nAdam Rose, a professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Sol Price School of Public Policy and an expert in the economics of disaster, said the estimated $2.5bn pricetag was probably exaggerated, mostly because it did not account for the way people respond to crises.\n\n\u201cOutages of two or three days typically don\u2019t have a widespread impact because businesses typically can absorb the losses and recoup costs over time,\u201d Rose said.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy protection in January and said it was facing more than $30bn in liabilities after it was determined its power lines were responsible for sparking the fire.\n\nRose said it was possible that PG&E had run a cost-benefit analysis and chose to shut down the power out of an abundance of caution.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that PG&E has gotten skittish about their liability and is probably more likely to shut things down than they were a couple years ago. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to speculate that they overreacted. Unfortunately the prevalence of these events are going to increase with climate change,\u201d Rose said.\n\nStill, Rose said there was probably a more efficient way to deal with the risk, such as shutting off power more selectively or burying power lines.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said on Wednesday that the blackouts were an unfortunate but necessary step to prevent wind-driven wildfires like the deadly blaze in Paradise, California, that last year killed 85 people and scorched 150,000 acres.\n\n\u201cNo one is satisfied with this. But I do believe with the limited number of tools in the toolkit what they\u2019re doing is appropriate under the circumstances,\u201d Newsom said on Tuesday. \u201cI tell you what would not be appropriate. To not turn out the lights and literally turn our back to public safety and put the lives of thousands of people at risk. That is not a gross exaggeration.\u201d\n\nNewsom didn\u2019t mince words when it came to the utility company\u2019s management.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m outraged, because it didn\u2019t need to happen,\u201d he said on Wednesday in San Diego. \u201cThey\u2019re in bankruptcy because of their terrible management going back decades. They created these conditions.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, with classes canceled due to the blackout, all was quiet at the University of California, Berkeley. Across the street from campus, at the Ladle and Leaf sandwich shop, employee Ricky Alvarez said around noon that the business hadn\u2019t lost power but they were likely to lose food if they did.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see. If we lose power for an hour we\u2019ll be fine. But if we\u2019re talking four or more hours we\u2019re going to be throwing a lot away,\u201d Alvarez said.\n\n\ufeff", "description": "Precautionary cuts, meant to limit wildfire danger, has economic impact on businesses from restaurants to transit", "authors": ["Mario Koran"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47d08600e87549fe9c10e2bf2cf43c235296dc0a/0_160_4815_2889/master/4815.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=407f686052f57f9cf915e453a3741d0e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
