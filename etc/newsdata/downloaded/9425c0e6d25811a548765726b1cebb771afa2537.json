Their handling is extraordinary. They rarely flirt with \u2018flat\u2019 balls and forward passes, much preferring legal passes at a more acute angle with receivers lying slightly deeper with devastating results.\n\nThey are disciplined in defence and don\u2019t creep offside trying to nick metres. The box kick \u2014 which more than any other aspect of the game is killing it as a spectacle and is massively overused by the top nations \u2014 is anathema to Japan.\n\nThe box kick is the modus operandi of those who haven\u2019t got the skill or imagination to execute anything more ambitious. Japan\u2019s amazing fitness allows them to play the game differently from any team other than the All Blacks.\n\nThe amount of time the ball is in play has gone to a different level with Japan and it is compulsive watching for any sports fan.\n\nThey must be a complete nightmare to play against but just look at the sheer joy on the faces of players and fans alike when Japan take centre stage. I\u2019ve even seen them compared with the great Brazil football teams in their approach and impact.\n\nJapan produced a stunning display to become the first Asian team to reach the quarter-finals\n\nJapan are a team who we have all fallen in love with and who can make rugby a better and more inclusive game \u2014 one with genuine worldwide appeal.\n\nYet all of this will count for nothing if the closed shop of world rugby does not allow Japan to progress immediately.\n\nThe cosy club of nations \u2014 with long-shared commercial interests \u2014 continue to hijack and carve up the game in their interests and to finance their domestic games.\n\nThis cannot continue. It is the Six Nations and Rugby Championship \u2014 essentially private companies formed by the unions \u2014 who dictate how the global game is structured, who is and who is not allowed in, when clearly this has to be the job of World Rugby, the governing body.\n\nThe Six Nations and the Rugby Championship want to perpetuate the status quo. They don\u2019t want anybody else joining unless they increase the profitability of that club. That has to change.\n\nThey are a team that fans have all fallen in love with and who can make rugby a better game\n\nRugby has been shooting itself in the foot for too long. I am old enough to remember when an incredible touring Fiji team in 1970 destroyed the Barbarians at Gosforth \u2014 a Barbarians team that was basically the starting line-up of the Lions team of 1971.\n\nThey produced extraordinary rugby that would look spectacular even by today\u2019s standards and briefly became a TV sensation.\n\nBut they were also treated like a novelty act with no place at rugby\u2019s top table.\n\nIf there had been a World Cup in 1983, Romania might well have reached the semi-finals, but the old Five Nations would not contemplate them joining their tournament.\n\nSamoa, throughout the 1990s, were a major team. But the established southern hemisphere giants were terrified of letting this small but mighty rugby nation grow too big and successful.\n\nSo there has been no place for them in the Tri Nations or the Rugby Championship and no place in Super Rugby.\n\nSamoa are a rugby nation that have been prevented from growing too big and successful\n\nThey and other Pacific Island teams are viewed as being there to make up the numbers every four years.\n\nSamoa have withered on the vine, Tonga receive no encouragement, while Fiji somehow keep going on pure, natural talent despite having so many players lured away. They are offered no pathway to compete on equal terms with others.\n\nThere is a better way \u2014 and it is promotion and relegation.\n\nDivision One would start off as New Zealand, Australia, Argentina and South Africa, but one of those should be relegated every year to be replaced by the winner of a feeder tournament that would consist initially of Japan, Fiji, Tonga and Samoa.\n\nDitto the Six Nations. I look at Georgia and I see loads of potential in their players and domestic infrastructure, but I also see a team beginning to mark time and I fear they might \u2018do a Samoa\u2019 and go into decline.\n\nThey are being offered no route to improve.\n\nGeorgia \u2014 and the likes of Russia, Spain and perhaps Romania if it is not too late \u2014 need the incentive of promotion.\n\nGeorgia are a team with loads of potential but they need the incentive of promotion\n\nAnd let us be honest, some Six Nations countries would benefit from the kick up the backside the possibility of relegation might provide.\n\nIt would be a good thing for Italy who, compared with Japan, are so limited in their approach to the game.\n\nRugby must treat all nations equally. They must have an equal opportunity on the pitch and equal votes off the pitch. Their voice must carry equal weight and not be drowned out by the old boys\u2019 club carving up the game.\n\nThe sport is changing and that change must be for the better. Look at the focus on concussion and dangerous tackles. It should have taken place 30 years ago when the athletes playing rugby started to become so much bigger and more powerful.\n\nThe same must apply with the organisation of Test rugby. World Rugby need to take control and give us a coherent structure within which all the world\u2019s teams can operate and grow.\n\nFor a start let\u2019s ditch this horrible Tier One, Tier Two, Tier Three demarcation.\n\nThe big boys will hate this but they need to readjust to the new reality. If we don\u2019t change now \u2014 in the next couple of seasons \u2014 I fear Japan will become yet another lost opportunity.\n\nAnd what a ridiculous, insane waste that would be.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: Japan's march to the World Cup last eight and their magnificent wins over Ireland and Scotland have been a welcome wake-up call for the rugby world.", "authors": ["Sir Clive Woodward For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/21/19710086-0-image-a-12_1571086402031.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
