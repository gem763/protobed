The first line can be a beast to get right whether you\u2019re composing a dating profile or drafting a workplace pitch \u2013 but when it comes to longform fiction, the stakes are vertiginous. Think of all that goes into writing a novel, from conception to final edit and beyond; then picture a prospective reader, besieged by competing demands from rival books, never mind films and binge-worthy boxsets. Imagine next that reader miraculously reaching for our author\u2019s work, scanning its jacket blurb, opening the cover... Connections don\u2019t come much more intimate than that between an author and their reader, and the first sentence is the writer\u2019s chance to woo. Make it enticing enough \u2013 pack in sufficient intrigue, atmosphere and character, and do so in a voice that\u2019s compelling enough \u2013 and the reader will read on. It\u2019s no wonder Stephen King still spends months, sometimes years, getting his opening salvo exactly right.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- The cult books that lost their cool\n\n- Is failure the new literary success?\n\n- The story of cannibalism that came true\n\nOne writer who pulled off a hat-trick of near-ideal openers is Charles Dickens. There\u2019s David Copperfield, of course (\u201cWhether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show\u201d), and A Christmas Carol is succinct perfection (\u201cMarley was dead, to begin with\u201d), but the show-stealer remains A Tale of Two Cities. Parodied, imitated, enduringly familiar even to those who\u2019ve never read the novel, the line beginning \u201cIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times\u201d is a belter. A sustained rhetorical flourish, it primes us for the intensely contradictory world that characterises this story of love and revolution.\n\nWe frontload our expectations, insisting that a handful of words must contain the DNA of all that is to come\n\nA Tale of Two Cities turns 160 this November, but though its first sentence \u2013 all 119 words of it \u2013 is by far and away its most celebrated feature, beginnings weren\u2019t much dwelled upon when Dickens penned it. The earliest English-language novels tended to favour leisurely, not to say long-winded set-ups, often deferring the start with a preface. Contrast that with a style that\u2019s been dominant for around a century now, of arriving late and dropping the reader into the narrative in medias res \u2013 in the middle of things. These days, it\u2019s not just the style of opening sentences that is different, it\u2019s the weight we give them as critics, writers, even readers. We frontload our expectations, insisting that a handful of words must contain the DNA of all that is to come, encapsulating the conflict of a 300-page story.\n\nOf course, there are as many ways of beginning a novel as there are novels, and yet themes and trends are there for the spotting. There\u2019s the sweeping statement, for instance, provocative and seductive in its certainty, of which Leo Tolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina is surely the best-known example \u2013 \u201cAll happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\u201d is surely the best-known example. And LP Hartley\u2019s The Go-Between (\u201cThe past is a foreign country: they do things differently there\u201d) adds a plangent note that still reverberates, well over half a century on. Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice \u2013 an opener almost as famous as Dickens\u2019 \u2013 subverts this epigrammatic set-up with a layer of characteristic irony: \u201cIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife\u201d.\n\nAnother approach is to state plain \u2018facts\u2019. \u201cI am an invisible man\u201d makes a bluffly apt beginning to Ralph Ellison\u2019s The Invisible Man. Equally concise is the start of Renata Adler\u2019s cult classic, Speedboat: \u201cNobody died that year\u201d, a line that instantly prompts questions which can only be answered by reading on. Donna Tartt\u2019s The Secret History manipulates the reader still more deftly: \u201cThe snow in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead for several weeks before we came to understand the gravity of our situation\u201d.\n\nAnomalies can be especially alluring when paired with the humdrum, as George Orwell knew. \u201cIt was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen\u201d, begins Nineteen Eighty-Four. Or how about Jeffrey Eugenides\u2019 Middlesex? \u201cI was born twice: first, as a baby girl, on a remarkably smogless Detroit day of January 1960; and then again, as a teenage boy, in an emergency room near Petoskey, Michigan, in August of 1974\u201d.\n\nOther authors choose to accentuate the fictional nature of their work. Anne Tyler is among the multitude who\u2019ve used the four words that captivate every budding bookworm. \u201cOnce upon a time, there was a woman who discovered she had turned into the wrong person,\u201d opens Back When We Were Grownups. Similarly, Annie Proulx nods to her literary forbears when she declares in The Shipping News, \u201cHere is an account of a few years in the life of Quoyle, born in Brooklyn and raised in a shuffle of dreary upstate towns\u201d.\n\nIn the mood\n\nAnd then there\u2019s mood. You\u2019ll read a lot about voice in creative-writing primers but mood can be just as potent, as Proulx\u2019s opening line demonstrates with its \u201cshuffle of dreary upstate towns\u201d. Likewise, the first sentence of Sylvia Plath\u2019s only novel, The Bell Jar, locates its narrative in time, place and, most powerfully, mood: \u201cIt was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn\u2019t know what I was doing in New York.\u201d Its eerie aimlessness is made still more affecting for having been published less than a month before Plath\u2019s suicide.\n\nThe first sentence of The End of the Affair finds Graham Greene ruminating on the very nature of a tale\u2019s start: \u201cA story has no beginning or end; arbitrarily one chooses that moment of experience from which to look back or from which to look ahead\u201d. Meta much? Well, not compared with Italo Calvino, who started his 1979 novel If on a winter\u2019s night a traveller with the line: \u201cYou are about to begin reading Italo Calvino\u2019s new novel, If on a winter\u2019s night a traveller\u201d.\n\nSo what are the rules of writing a great opening line? Unsurprisingly, for writers with talent enough, there are none. Madeleine L\u2019Engle even got away with repurposing a clich\u00e9 so mocked that the author to whom it\u2019s been attributed (not altogether fairly) now has named after him a prize rewarding the very worst opening. I\u2019m referring to Edward Bulwer-Lytton and the rambling sentence that starts \u201cIt was a dark and stormy night\u2026\u201d. In his time, Bulwer-Lytton was more widely read than Dickens, also coining the phrase \u201cthe pen is mightier than the sword\u201d, but it\u2019s for his pilloried opener that he\u2019s best remembered, hence San Jose State University\u2019s annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, in which entrants submit dire opening sentences from non-existent works. And yet L\u2019Engle begins her zany \u2013 and much praised \u2013 YA classic, A Wrinkle in Time, with those same seven words. Fans of Charles M Schulz might recall that Snoopy was also fond of the formulation.\n\nSome of the most celebrated first lines owe their might largely to what follows\n\nEvery bibliophile has their own favourite first line (I\u2019m partial to Dodie Smith\u2019s I Capture the Castle, \u201cI write this sitting in the kitchen sink\u201d) and there\u2019s irresistible literary sport to be had from comparing lists. All the same, taking them in isolation does rather miss the point. After all, the chief function of a first sentence is to make you read on. It\u2019s true, too, that some of the most celebrated first lines owe their might largely to what follows. Consider, for instance, Charlotte Bronte\u2019s Jane Eyre: \u201cThere was no possibility of taking a walk that day\u201d. As sentences go, its charms are discreet to say the least. And yet those 10 words, as anyone who returns to them having reached the novel\u2019s end, capture so much about its eponymous heroine\u2019s character \u2013 her low expectations, her bottomless capacity for disappointment.\n\nShorter by a word is Daphne du Maurier\u2019s Rebecca. \u201cLast night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\u201d. Much of what makes it so evocative, so very intriguing, stems from what we subsequently learn about the narrator and Manderley. Since we\u2019re talking length, one of literature\u2019s most famous openers is just three words long. But isn\u2019t part of what makes Herman Melville\u2019s \u201cCall me Ishmael\u201d so startling to do with the digressive \u2013 and, yes, impressive \u2013 marathon that is the rest of Moby Dick?\n\nThere\u2019s a feeling that choosing a book by its opening line is somehow more respectable than judging it by its cover. But both are a form of advertising and just as there\u2019s something to be said for being swayed by a novel\u2019s jacket (an entire team of professionals have laboured to ensure that it sends precisely the right message), so we\u2019d be dolts to place too much emphasis on its opening sentence. After all, some excellent novels have entirely forgettable, if not actively off-putting, first lines. Here\u2019s Ian McEwan\u2019s feted The Child In Time: \u201cSubsidising public transport had long been associated in the minds of both Government and the majority of its public with the denial of individual liberty\u201d.\n\nIt seems fair to say that while we carry the best opening lines around with us, like locket-sized mementoes of dear friends, we are equally prepared to forgive all but the very worst. This isn\u2019t always so with last lines, and there\u2019s a strong case to be made for these being of equal if not greater importance. After all, a reader has invested time, thought and emotion in a book by the time they turn the final page. As for A Tale of Two Cities, no spoiler alerts are required to confirm that Dickens nailed his closing sentence, too: \u201cIt is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known\u201d.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
