(AP) - Some families go trick-or-treating for Halloween.\n\nNorah and Matt Mayers make a movie.\n\nEach Halloween, the father and daughter from Weehawken offer their own take on a scary film for the haunted season. Norah is always the star, and Matt is the director and co-star.\n\nThis year\u2019s pick: Stephen King\u2019s \u201cIt.\u201d\n\nIn the resulting short film, titled \u201cThat,\u201d Matt plays Pennywise the evil clown. Like King\u2019s demonic joker, he holds a cluster of red balloons. And forget dressing up for one night: this dad showed his dedication to the part by shaving his beard to make way for face paint.\n\nIt\u2019s all in service of adapting horror in a way that\u2019s not too gory or scary, Matt says. Plus, it\u2019s really just the ultimate father-daughter Halloween project.\n\nBill Skarsgard played Pennywise in the recent film \u201cIt Chapter Two\u201d and the 2017 movie \u201cIt.\u201d Tim Curry portrayed the maleficent clown in the 1990 miniseries.\n\nMatt, 40, says that since the recent films are not appropriate for Norah, 10, to watch, they saw the Tim Curry adaptation of the 1986 King novel, and formulated their version by combining elements from both takes.\n\nHe writes a script and storyboards each film before several days of shooting and editing.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of fun,\u201d Norah, who plans to be a gothic doll for Halloween, tells NJ Advance Media. \u201cThis is the first one where he had jump scares.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also the first film in which the cast of characters incorporates other children from the neighborhood.\n\nFor the Halloween shorts, Matt and Norah work under the banner Mayers Family Films. But Matt is also a professional filmmaker and has a production company, Mayers Films, with his brother Ryan. He normally works on commercials, advertising campaigns and documentaries.\n\n\u201cThis is our third year doing it,\u201d Matt says of the father-daughter Halloween tradition. He always tries to teach Norah a little about filmmaking in the process.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s really into sci-fi and horror,\u201d he tells NJ Advance Media. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up loving horror films. It\u2019s my passion.\u201d\n\nIt just so happens that he was reading King\u2019s novel before he staged a compressed version of the film with his daughter.\n\n\u201cEvery year we try to make it better than last,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the four-minute film, the Mayers emulate the look and feel of \u201cIt,\u201d setting their version Weehawken instead of King\u2019s fictional Derry, Maine - after, all, Matt says, in \u201cIt,\u201d the town itself acts as another character.\n\nIn one scene, Norah hears her name being called from a storm drain in a recreation of the famous scene from the story, albeit with a less gruesome result. Matt\u2019s Pennywise appears in the drain, thanks to some digital effects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our way to pay homage,\u201d he says.\n\nMatt and his wife, Stephanie, a publicist and agent who represents family-friendly entertainers, have lived in Weehawken for 13 years. They have two daughters - Norah and her sister, Hannah, 4 (who gets an assistant director credit in one of the films).\n\nIn the latest short film, local kids are hounded by Pennywise and find him in a book about Weehawken history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun and it show the kids the process of movie-making,\u201d Matt says. \u201cThey really get into it.\u201d\n\nPrevious Halloween efforts from the family have included a Freddy Krueger-themed romp (\u201cA Nightmare On Norah\u2019s Street,\u201d co-starring Stephanie Mayers) and a \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d-inspired short (\u201cNorah of the Living Dead\u201d) that ends up being a \u201cStar Wars\u201d mashup.\n\n\u201cThe one that we made this year is my favorite one,\u201d says Norah, who watches intently as her father edits each film.\n\nHe recently hosted a screening for the child actors and their parents, and has been generating good local buzz after posting the short film on social media Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time-consuming, but it totally paid off,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople expect them, they\u2019ve been waiting for them. We have a fan base.\u201d\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2PgkxBM\n\n___\n\nInformation from: NJ Advance Media.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Some families go trick-or-treating for Halloween.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Amy Kuperinsky"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
