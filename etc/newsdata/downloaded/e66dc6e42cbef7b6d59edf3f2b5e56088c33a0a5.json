(Photo: Gabriel Olsen/Getty Images)\n\nLashana Lynch is shaking up the James Bond franchise.\n\nThe actress, who\u2019s been cast in the upcoming James Bond movie, reportedly as 007, has been photographed for the first time on the set of Bond 25, officially titled No Time to Die, in Italy.\n\nLynch, already familiar to Captain Marvel fans, will give an historic performance, as she\u2019ll be the first woman to fill the iconic role. Her casting has divided fans, even though she\u2019ll only have Bond\u2019s old agent number. Daniel Craig will be back for one final outing as the suave spy, but the movie depicts a retired Bond being called back into service. He faces off against a villain played by Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019s Rami Malek.\n\nFirst look: Female 007 Lashana Lynch on James Bond set https://t.co/cnxeDxBwiG pic.twitter.com/VWzlvr6h1e \u2014 New York Post (@nypost) September 27, 2019\n\nA snapshot of Lynch at work on the set, published by the New York Post, shows her relaxed but ready to jump into the action.\n\nAlready, some fans were unhappy, and suggested or flat-out said they wouldn\u2019t see the movie.\n\nI guess 001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 006, 008, and 009 were all taken \u2014 Sith Khan (@sithkhan) September 27, 2019\n\nIt's gonna flop. Messing with my 007 movies. Dang. \u2014 Shawn Lloyd (@JediMasterMason) September 27, 2019\n\nThis movie will get 100% by the critics and 0% by the audience. This is a farce \u2014 Ryan (@ABCanada84) September 27, 2019\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge, who picked up three Emmys for her work on TV series Fleabag and Killing Eve last week, is one of the co-writers on the movie. She dismissed questions about whether Bond is still relevant in 2019 in a May interview.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s absolutely relevant now,\u201d Waller-Bridge told BBC America. \u201cIt has just got to grow. It has just got to evolve, and the important thing is that the film treats the women properly. He doesn\u2019t have to. He needs to be true to this character.\u201d\n\nThe movie is scheduled to debut in theaters on April 8, 2020.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
