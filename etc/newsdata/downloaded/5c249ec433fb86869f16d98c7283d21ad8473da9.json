Biden held a paid position on Burisma\u2019s board starting in 2014.\n\nA statement posted to the Ukrainian General Prosecutor\u2019s website on Friday said that 15 criminal procedures involving Zlochevsky, a former government minister, are up for review.\n\n\u201cIf it is found that the proceedings have been closed in violation of the law or other procedural violations have been committed, then we will take appropriate decisions,\u201d the statement said. \u201cNo procedural decisions related to the proceedings against the aforementioned person or any persons related to Mykola [Zlochevsky] or his companies have been taken at this time.\u201d\n\nUkrainian officials have said that earlier probes focused on a time period before Hunter Biden joined the company, and that there\u2019s no evidence that the former Vice President\u2019s son broke any laws.\n\nHouse Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry last week against Trump over his push for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, after Trump\u2019s actions were flagged by a still-anonymous intelligence community whistleblower who warned Trump seemed to be soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement suggests Ukrainian officials are struggling to find some kind of middle ground in a deep political crisis, said Volodymyr Fesenko a veteran political analyst in Kiev and head of the Penta think tank.\n\nREAD: Rudy and the Gang: Your Guide to the Cast of Trump's Ukraine Scandal\n\n\u201cThis is a flexible reaction to a very tricky situation,\u201d Fesenko said, adding that the announcement doesn\u2019t yet show Ukraine is yielding to Trump\u2019s demands, \u201cfor now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe key word is audit and not investigation,\u201d said David Szakonyi, an expert on the former Soviet Union at George Washington University in Washington DC. \u201cThe expected timeline or possible outcomes of such an audit are being left intentionally vague.\u201d\n\nSzakonyi said the Zelensky government appears to be calculating that the appearance of action, even if it\u2019s a half-measure, may buy room to maneuver from Trump\u2019s White House.\n\nUkrainian officials worry that leaning too far in favor of Trump or his opponents could disrupt the bipartisan American support Ukraine has relied on to continue fighting its bloody war with Russian-backed separatists on its eastern border, analysts said.\n\nREAD: Let\u2019s Check In on Ukraine\u2019s President, Who\u2019s Pretending None of This Is Really Happening\n\nUkraine\u2019s President Zelensky took office this year promising to fight his country\u2019s legacy of endemic corruption, and the prosecutor\u2019s statement appears in keeping with that broader campaign promise, analysts said.\n\n\u201cAs I understand it, it's an audit \u2014 they\u2019re not reopening cases,\u201d said Olga Oliker, European Program Director for the International Crisis Group. \u201cThey're trying to figure out just what their predecessors left them with.\u201d\n\nCover: President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the InterContinental Barclay New York hotel during the United Nations General Assembly, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2019, in New York.
