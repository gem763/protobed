The secretary was displeased that forecasters at the National Weather Service, which is overseen by NOAA, had contradicted President Trump\u2019s incorrect warning that Hurricane Dorian was on track to hit Alabama. The threat was an abuse of authority aimed at misleading the public to provide cover for the president.\n\nFor those not following the Hurricane Dorian controversy: On Sept. 1, Mr. Trump tweeted a warning to residents of several states, including Alabama, that they would \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d by the storm. A few minutes later, responding to inquiries from concerned Alabamians, the Birmingham office of the National Weather Service issued a tweet clarifying that the state would \u201cNOT see any impacts from Dorian.\u201d\n\nGovernment scientists attempting to stem the spread of bad information about a natural disaster should be seen as fulfilling their duty. A White House official suggested the correction was an attempt to show up the president. Mr. Trump then spent the next several days scrambling to prove he had been right, an increasingly embarrassing spectacle best captured by a media briefing on Sept. 4, at which he displayed a map that appeared to have been doctored with a Sharpie to show a sliver of Alabama in the storm\u2019s path. As the mockery grew louder, the White House decided to get serious.", "description": "The commerce secretary deceived Congress on the census and threatened those who told the truth about the weather.
