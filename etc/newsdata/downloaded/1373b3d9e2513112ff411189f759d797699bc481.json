As Trysta Krick details, Washington is brink while the Astros are one game away from a classic comeback. USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 There may not a soul who with more at stake in this World Series.\n\nBut he's not swinging a bat, throwing a ball or even managing a game.\n\nHe instead is watching from his Southern California home, insisting there is no rooting interest for either team.\n\nBut no matter who wins this World Series, with Game 6 on Tuesday between the Houston Astros and Washington Nationals, he will be the biggest winner of all.\n\nIt's super-agent Scott Boras. And he just so happens to represent the biggest stars in this World Series.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had prominent players playing in the World Series before,\u2019\u2019 Boras tells USA TODAY Sports, \u201cbut nothing quite like this.\"\n\nThe top position player eligible for free agency and in line for payday over $250 million, is third baseman Anthony Rendon.\n\nHe is represented by Boras.\n\nThe best pitcher eligible for free agency, and will almost certainly be provided the richest contract for a pitcher in history, perhaps even earning more than Rendon, is Astros starter Gerrit Cole.\n\nHis agent is Boras.\n\nStephen Strasburg, the Nationals' starting pitcher in Game 6, has an opt-out clause and can declare free agency.\n\nGuess who his agent is.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re about to make Scott richer than he already is,\u2019\u2019 Rendon said.\n\nWORLD SERIES: Nationals' hopes fade with three straight losses\n\nGERRIT COLE: Ace delivers one last gem for Astros\n\nBoras represents nine players on the 40-man roster on both teams, including ALCS MVP Jose Altuve of the Astros and 21-year-old sensation Juan Soto of the Nationals, has had a major impact in these teams\u2019 success.\n\nAnd may have even a greater influence for their future.\n\nIf the Nationals are going to make return trip to the World Series, they desperately could use Rendon.\n\nThey Nats already made Rendon a seven-year offer for about $210 million for before the playoffs.\n\nSorry, Boras says, not good enough.\n\nThe Nats desperately want Strasburg to stay, and co-anchor the rotation with Max Scherzer, another Boras client. Strasburg has four years and $100 million remaining on his contract, with $40 million deferred without interest. They have three days after the World Series to extend or re-work Strasburg\u2019s contract, or he could opt out and test the free-agent waters for the first time in his career.\n\n\u201cStephen Strasburg has had an amazing season,\u2019\u2019 Boras says, \u201cbut he has yet to make that decision. I haven\u2019t even talked to Stephen or [wife] Rachel about it. I haven\u2019t even addressed it. When the season ends, we will sit down and talk and see what he wants to do.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd if Strasburg doesn\u2019t want to opt out now, he can change his mind a year from now, Boras reminds everyone, with another opt-out after 2020.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a camel option,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u201cthere are two humps to it.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Astros would love to keep their prized pitching corps together for another World Series run.\n\nWell, unless they\u2019re ready to shell out at least $240 million, and perhaps as much as $275 million, Cole will be taking his talents elsewhere.\n\nSo, yes, Boras is going to be quite a popular man this winter, with a stable of free agents whose postseason performances only enhanced their value.\n\nCole, who has lost only one start since May 22, continued his fabulous postseason run by dominating the Nats in Game 5 of the World Series with a three-hitter over seven innings. He went 4-1 with a 1.72 ERA in the postseason, and saved the Astros\u2019 season with a brilliant Game 5 performance in the AL Division Series clincher against the Tampa Bay Rays. He will finish first or second in Cy Young voting after going 20-5 with a 2.50 ERA and 326 strikeouts in 212 \u2153 innings during the regular season.\n\nRendon has put on a clinic in the postseason, hitting .308 with seven extra-base hits and nine RBI, while being a human highlight reel in the field.\n\n\u201cEverybody is calling me and telling me what a great baseball player he is,\u2019\u2019 Boras said. \u201cI saw him play his freshman year at Rice. I know he was going to be a great baseball player.\n\n\u201cNow, everybody is understanding this guy is an MVP-type player. He hits for average. He hits home runs. He\u2019s a great baserunner. His defense is unbelievable. And his baseball IQ is off the charts.\n\n\u201cWhat more could you want?\u2019\u2019\n\nAnthony Rendon led the majors with 126 RBI in 2019. (Photo: Jeff Roberson, AP)\n\nStrasburg went 18-6 with a 3.52 ERA and career-high 251 strikeouts during the regular season, and has a 5-2 career postseason record and 1.34 ERA, with 64 strikeouts in 47 innings. He kept their season alive in Game 5 of the Division Series against the Dodgers and won Game 2 of the World Series.\n\n\u201cTo be dominant in the postseason, to win elimination games,\u2019\u2019 Boras says, \u201cfrankly, that greatness just adds to your resume, and makes you even more valuable. These guys that show they can do it, their pedigree is documented.\"\n\nIn other words, their stock price is soaring through the roof.\n\nBoras has a stranglehold on this year\u2019s free agent market. He also represents starters Hyun-Jin Ryu and Dallas Keuchel, infielder Mike Moustakas, and outfielders Nick Castellanos and J.D. Martinez, if he opts out.\n\nYet, for now, he\u2019s focusing his attention on his star attractions in the World Series, even though he insists he\u2019s staying neutral.\n\nStill, while he may have no public rooting interest, Boras is more closely aligned with the Nats than any team in baseball.\n\nWhen the Nationals had the first draft pick in the country in back-to-back years, they selected Strasburg and outfielder Bryce Harper, each represented by Boras.\n\nWhen Scherzer signed a seven-year, $210 million contract with the Nats, and outfielder Jayson Werth was their first big-free agent signing at $126 million in 2010, they were negotiated by Boras.\n\nAnd when Harper rejected a 10-year, $300 million contract from the Nats, eventually signing for $330 million over 13 years with the Philadelphia Phillies, Boras pulled the strings.\n\nNats owner Ted Lerner\u2019s relationship with Boras is legendary, and Boras and general manager Mike Rizzo are confidants.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Ted for a long time,\u2019\u2019 Boras says, \u201cand Rizzo is a very, very adept baseball man and a great scout. He knows the character of players. He really gets it. And he\u2019s not afraid to call us and ask about players in the draft.\n\n\u201cI still remember when they drafted Rendon. There were five teams that passed on him, and after they got him, I called Rizzo and said, 'How did you just get the best pick in the draft?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt was on Boras\u2019 advice, he proudly says, why the Nationals were even able to land Strasburg and Harper with back-to-back No. 1 picks in 2009 and 2010.\n\n\u201cI remember Ted was interested in signing Mark Teixeira (after the 2008 season), and I said, 'You shouldn\u2019t sign him,\u2019 \" Boras said. \u201c'It doesn\u2019t really work for him or you. It behooves you to do this slowly, and not win so much. You want to take advantage of some unique players coming out in those drafts.'\n\n\u201cThe Lerners looked at the big picture, it allowed them to build a core, and then signing Scherzer really developed some algorithms for Ted.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt was no different than lending advice to the Astros when Jim Crane bought the franchise in 2011.\n\n\u201cWhen Jim became owner,\u2019\u2019 Boras says, \u201che flew to my office, sat down, and said, 'I want to build this thing right.\u2019 \"\n\nAnd now, here are the Nats and Astros, the last teams standing.\n\nJust one will be holding the World Series trophy but Boras, along with his clients, will be walking away with the riches.", "description": "Baseball super-agent Scott Boras represents free-agents-to-be in Anthony Rendon, Gerrit Cole and Stephen Strasburg.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
