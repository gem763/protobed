Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-Mass.) recent rise in the polls, including her new status at the top of the most recent Quinnipiac University survey, is due to an increase in support for the lawmaker from several groups. But the biggest gain comes from white college-educated voters.\n\nWith 27 percent of the support of Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning voters, Warren is more or less tied with former vice president Joe Biden in Wednesday\u2019s Quinnipiac University national poll. He received 25 percent of the vote. The two percentage-point difference falls within the margin of error, but this is the first time Warren took the numerical lead in a Quinnipiac survey.\n\nThe next closest candidate is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) with 16 percent of the vote.\n\nMuch has been made about Warren\u2019s growing popularity with young voters \u2014 she stood in line for four hours earlier this month taking selfies with people who attended her speech near New York University. And while she is not polling as well with black voters as Biden or Sanders, she has growing support with the demographic according to other polls.\n\nAs another friend and respected colleague comes out in favor of Warren, I recognize the black folk they keep polling who support Biden. But I don\u2019t see them polling anyone who doesn\u2019t. And in my clergy and academic black women circles, Warren is the clear favorite. \u2014 Black in Paradise (@WilGafney) September 24, 2019\n\nBut the lawmaker\u2019s support grew from 25 percent in late August to 37 percent in late September with white college-educated voters, an influential group that largely voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nQuinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said: \u201cDig a little deeper, and the reasons behind Warren\u2019s rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee. On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes \u2014 even if it means things are harder along the way.\u201d\n\nSeven out of 10 Democrats said they would be excited if Warren became the Democratic nominee for president in 2020. Fewer \u2014 56 percent \u2014 said they would feel the same about Biden winning the nomination.\n\nAnd the excitement is rooted in Warren\u2019s left-of-center ideas \u2014 she has released dozens of plans on topics ranging from universal child care to getting rid of the electoral college. Because of her left-leaning politics, some assumed that Sanders would be most at risk of losing his support to Warren. But this poll suggests that Warren may mostly be taking support from Biden \u2014 and that could continue.\n\nWarren is less well known than Biden. Only 9 percent of those surveyed haven\u2019t heard of Biden, who served in Congress for three decades before becoming the vice president to America\u2019s first black president. Nearly 20 percent haven\u2019t heard of Warren.\n\nThis means there\u2019s a good chance for an uptick in support for Warren. As more people become aware of who she is, there\u2019s a chance of more people liking what she is saying \u2014 and keeping her at the top of the polls.", "description": "But the lawmaker\u2019s support grew from 25 percent in late August to 37 percent in late September with white college-educated voters in a Quinnipiac poll.", "authors": ["Eugene Scott", "Reporter Covering Identity Politics For The Fix", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OEhbnyK20cyHuxfc7XLPqnTtCmY=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-18-2019/t_c15fe3099d604062af457f22e8434a75_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_00_05_03_Still014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
