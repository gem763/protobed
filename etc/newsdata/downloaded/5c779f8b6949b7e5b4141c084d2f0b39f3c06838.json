Republican women like former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, presidential primary candidates Carly Fiorina and Rep. Michele Bachmann, and Trump White House officials Sarah Sanders and Kellyanne Conway have been targeted by other women for shocking attacks.\n\nLESLIE MARSHALL: HILLARY CLINTON-TULSI GABBARD FEUD IS A GIFT TO TRUMP \u2013 IT NEEDS TO END NOW\n\nBut now we see the contagion has spread. If Clinton \u2013 a woman who has been a first lady, senator, secretary of state, and presidential nominee \u2013 can viciously attack a woman of the same political party who has followed her lead and is running for president, we know no one is safe.\n\nGet ready for the 2024 elections. Former South Carolina Gov. and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley \u2013 or any other woman brave enough to run for president \u2013 will be savaged by other women with accusations of betrayal, incompetence and malfeasance.\n\nWhat has become clear is that if a woman is not in lockstep with Clinton and the establishment Democrats, they will oil her ladder to the final glass ceiling.\n\nThe accusation that Gabbard \u2013 who represents Hawaii in the U.S. House and has been decorated for her service in the Army National Guard \u2013 could be working for a hostile foreign power should not be taken seriously.\n\nSo what on Earth has Gabbard done to attract Clinton\u2019s scorn?\n\nPerhaps Gabbard was attacked because while she says she is pro-choice she holds a marginally more nuanced view on abortion than Clinton.\n\nOr perhaps Gabbard was attacked because she openly declares her love for our country, which undermines the leftist narrative that America is inherently evil and should be fundamentally transformed.\n\nI don\u2019t support Gabbard. But her treatment by the Clinton Machine should be called out.\n\nOf course, the leftist media wants in on the fun. They have a long history of unjustly attacking women who disagree with them on issues, while not going after women more sympathetic to their views.\n\nFor example, feminist Tina Fey was eager to portray Sarah Palin on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d as a mindless puppet of the Republican Party. When Fey said \u201cI can see Russia from my house\u201d \u2013 in her role portraying Palin \u2013 the media practically treated the line as if Palin had actually said those words (she never did).\n\nThere has yet to be a similarly caustic depiction of far-left Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., on \u201cSNL.\u201d\n\nInstead, we have a very public transformation by Clinton into the character Regina George, the female antagonist who torments anyone who doesn\u2019t conform to her standards, brought to life in Fey\u2019s \u201cMean Girls,\u201d a film whose purpose was to push sisterly bonds of feminism.\n\nHollywood loves to pile on. After Trump was elected, Madonna chimed in by saying that \u201cit feels like women betrayed us.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Democrats asked women to elect Hillary Clinton as the first woman president. If Clinton supporters were met by any reluctance \u2013 including on issues of policy from both their own base or by Republicans \u2013 they quoted former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who said: \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for women who don\u2019t help each other.\u201d\n\nHowever, this sisterly solidarity was ignored in 2018, when feminists offered no assistance to Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn when she successfully campaigned to become the first woman senator from Tennessee.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nRather than support Blackburn, the feminists campaigned for a 74-year-old man dusted off from the shelf of retirement because they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to support a woman with whom they disagreed on important issues.\n\nVoting on a candidate\u2019s policy positions rather than gender is fair enough and makes sense. But why on Earth should Democrats be surprised when women do the exact same thing when voting for a Republican?\n\nWhat should worry American women isn\u2019t the feigned surprise when Democrats are confronted with the fact that women have a diverse range of thought. What should worry us is the accusation that those of us whose views include supporting President Trump are either disloyal to our sex or unintelligent and incapable of discerning the \u201ctruth\u201d and victims of \u201cinternalized misogyny.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTruthfully, doesn\u2019t the view by some women that other women can\u2019t look at the facts and legitimately come to a different conclusion meet the definition of internalized misogyny? This is the natural consequence of dividing people into identity groups, certainly, but it\u2019s also an unmasking of feminist hypocrisy.\n\nI truly believe the first woman president will be a Republican, and she will get elected running on issues and by casting vision for the nation \u2013 not by suggesting we all fall in line and say \u201cI\u2019m With Her.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY PENNY YOUNG NANCE", "description": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s claim that presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard is \u201cthe favorite of the Russians\u201d in the Democratic primary and her implication that Gabbard is \u201ca Russian asset\u201d show that the former Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s talk of sisterhood and solidarity with other women is hogwash.", "authors": ["Penny Young Nance"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/22/694940094001_6096618438001_6096617801001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
