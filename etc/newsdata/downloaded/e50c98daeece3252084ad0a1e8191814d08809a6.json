The hosts chased Sri Lanka\u2019s 195-8 with ease on Wednesday at Allan Border Field, losing just one wicket as they reached the target in the 27th over.\n\nHealy (112no from 76 balls) brought up her third ODI hundred, but first on home soil, in 71 balls while last-game century maker Rachael Haynes (63 from 74) stuck with her in a 159-run opening stand. The wicketkeeper sealed the contest with a cleanly-hit six over long-on to cap a dominant run against the tourists, highlighted by a T20 record unbeaten 148 off just 61 balls last week in Sydney.\n\nECB launches \u00a320m plan to transform women\u2019s cricket and emulate Australia Read more\n\nThe victory continued Australia\u2019s two-year unbeaten streak in the format and saw them go past the 17-game record set by Belinda Clark\u2019s Australian team in the late 1990s. The national squad will now break for the WBBL, which begins next Friday, before the T20 World Cup on home soil next year.\n\nAustralia\u2019s men own the outright ODI record with 21 straight victories, set in 2003. But Lanning\u2019s side can match that streak with a clean-sweep of their three-game series in South Africa in March, when they next play 50-over cricket.\n\nAustralia were clinical against the world No 8 side, the gap in class obvious as both openers preyed on the visitor\u2019s pace attack in ideal batting conditions. Sri Lanka weren\u2019t completely powerless though, with standout Chamari Atapattu backing up her brilliant T20 century from earlier in the tour with another hundred after her side won the toss.\n\nThe opener hung in as wickets fell around her and the run-rate slowed, finishing with 103 from 128 balls in an innings that featured some exquisite cover driving. A collapse of 3-2, triggered by leg-spinner Georgia Wareham\u2019s (2-18) probing four-over spell, halted Sri Lanka\u2019s bright start though and the Australians didn\u2019t look back.", "description": "Alyssa Healy posted another unbeaten century against Sri Lanka to ensure Australia easily claimed a women\u2019s ODI world record 18th consecutive victory", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ef28d685e215eec3dbd8f4f87091d0739387273/0_50_1039_623/master/1039.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d8854a215d370d20d25ed8aac0bdb25b", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
