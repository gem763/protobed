Despite their seeming omnipresence, bicycles remained financially out of reach for many, including Ai's family.\n\nHis father, poet Ai Qing, was denounced by China's Communist Party in 1958 and his family was sent to labour camps, first near the North Korean border and then eventually in Xinjiang province.\n\nThey returned to Beijing in 1976 after the end of the cultural revolution.\n\nThe sculpture alludes to the bikes that flooded the streets of China, Ai Weiwei's home country, during his childhood. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC)\n\nThe Forks was seen as a perfect location for the piece because of its history, the number and diversity of its visitors, its accessibility to the public and its focus on public art, a news release from The Forks says.\n\nThe view from Forever Bicycles to the human rights museum is intentional. Ai is known for his human rights-related activism; he's openly critical of the Chinese government's stance on that topic and democracy.\n\nMuch of his work focuses on similar issues in other parts of the world as well. He was awarded the Adrienne Clarkson Prize for Global Citizenship in 2017.\n\nAi Weiwei is known for his human rights-related activism, being openly critical of the Chinese government's stance on that topic and democracy. (Ben Shannon/CBC)\n\nHis artwork and films have been displayed in Tokyo, Washington, New York, Israel, Mexico City and Inner Mongolia, among many other locations.\n\nThis is the first time it has been in Winnipeg.\n\n\"This is one of the most significant examples of contemporary public art in the world today. Its message is both profound and timely,\" Winnipeg philanthropist and arts patron Michael Nesbitt said in the news release. Nesbitt's donation to The Forks Foundation funded the loan and installation of Forever Bicycles.\n\n\"It's important that this work is being displayed at such a historic Canadian venue.\"\n\nThe mesmerizing pattern of 1,254 bicycles is being assembled this week in CN Field at The Forks. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC)\n\nThe Forks CEO Paul Jordan said art helps fulfil the mission and purpose of the historic public space, which is used for celebrations and recreation.\n\n\"Our role is to be a meeting place, open and accessible to everyone. Everything we do is run through that filter,\" he said.\n\n\"Art is often seen as inaccessible to many. With the works coming to us, we are able to offer a space that's not only fun to visit, but thought-provoking, challenging and interesting for everyone.\"\n\nAi's sculpture will be at The Forks site for two years, with a potential extension of one year.", "description": "A\u00a030-foot sculptural piece created from\u00a01,254 bicycles by internationally acclaimed\u00a0artist and activist Ai Weiwei is under construction in Winnipeg.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5295561.1569347533!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/forever-bicycles-sculpture-by-ai-weiwei.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
