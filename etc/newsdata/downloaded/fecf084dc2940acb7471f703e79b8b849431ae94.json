Her only move now is to take this to court and to prove that she is not guilty of what she\u2019s charged with.\"\n\nBut what, exactly, does she think that Felicity's sentence means for her? Well, the source adds:\n\nIf she\u2019s found guilty, she will go to jail; that is clear. And if another deal is offered to her, which I don\u2019t think it will be, she will go to jail. Her only chance of avoiding jail is to beat these charges. Lori is a smart woman; she understands that. She\u2019s scared and upset, but she\u2019s resolved to be strong and to fight this. She will do what she has to do to protect herself and her family...Lori is going to move forward as best as she can, but now she has a little more clarity about what will happen next.\n\nSo, uh, looks like Lori is still just *really* hoping that she's not found guilty!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "\"She\u2019s scared and upset.\"", "authors": ["Alanna Lauren Greco"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lUrOh7lLH62YvjXohXmWJA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/63d58ca31676504e05bf1542b4ff2d7b", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
