USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 Welcome to the marquee matchup of the postseason.\n\nHouston Astros vs. the New York Yankees.\n\nThe series America has been craving starts Saturday at 8:08 p.m. ET at Minute Maid Park in Houston.\n\nThese two teams combined for 210 victories during the regular season, marking only the seventh time in history that two 100-victory teams will meet in a series before the Fall Classic.\n\nThere will be plenty of star power with 11 players in the All-Star Game, and everywhere you look, there are MVPs, Cy Young winners and rookies of the year.\n\nWhy, the Astros could run the table in the individual awards just this year with Justin Verlander winning the American League Cy Young award, Alex Bregman winning the MVP award, and Yordan Alvarez winning the Rookie of the Year.\n\nIt has been that kind of year for the Astros.\n\nIncredibly, the one guy who won\u2019t win an award, likely losing out to Verlander in the Cy Young race, is Gerrit Cole.\n\nHe just so happens to be the most indispensable player in this ALCS.\n\nHouston Astros starting pitcher Gerrit Cole reacts after a double play.

They somehow were swept by the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nThe Yankees hope to pull off the sequel.\n\nThey don\u2019t have the starting pitching to match up, but intend to dominate the Astros with their star-studded cast in the bullpen, led by All-Star Aroldis Chapman. The Yankees aren\u2019t going to use eight relievers in a game like Tampa Bay Rays manager Kevin Cash did in Game 5, but they are well-rested. Chapman has pitched only seven times spanning seven innings and 114 pitches since Sept. 1. If they have a lead in the fifth inning, they believe they\u2019ll close the door for the final 12 outs with a combination of Chad Green, Zack Britton, Adam Ottavino and Tommy Kahnle.\n\n\u201cI think it's clear the bullpens will have to get important outs,\u2019\u2019 Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cYou would expect some close games. Some games that come down to the end where if you're going to be able to win a ball game you're going to have to close it out. So obviously we lean on our bullpen heavily.\n\n\u201cEven though starting pitching is obviously very important \u2026but usually when we look back at the end of these things the teams that are able to close out leads keep on advancing.\u2019\u2019\n\nALCS REMATCH: 'It's been brewing'\n\nNLCS: Why Cardinals will beat Nationals in NLCS\n\nAnd, yes, the Astros are well aware of the Astros\u2019 bullpen prowess.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good one,\u2019\u2019 Astros All-Star outfielder George Springer said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be a grind. They can control the zone. They all throw very, very hard, have good secondary pitches, and they\u2019re smart. So it\u2019s not going to be an easy task by any stretch of the imagination.\u2019\u2019\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON\n\nMinute Maid Park and Yankee Stadium\n\nMinute Maid Park can be a house of horrors for visiting teams. The Astros went a franchise-record 60-21 at home, and won 32 of their last 40 games at home. They also have been accused of espionage at their digs, and maybe it was just a coincidence, but Rays starter Tyler Glasnow believes he tipped pitches that resulted in four first-innings runs.\n\nThe Yankees lost all three postseason games at Minute Maid Park in 2017, and were winless again in Houston in their three regular-season games.\n\n\u201cClearly the Astros have obviously shown that they have a real home-field advantage here,\u2019\u2019 Boone said, \u201cnot only this year but even going back now a few years. And I think a lot of us are aware of how loud this place can be.\"\n\nThen again, it\u2019s hardly a treat playing at Yankee Stadium, where the Yankees went 57-24, including an insane 20-0-3 in their last 23 home series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to play there at any time of year, let alone October,\u2019\u2019 Springer said. \u201cIt's a crazy atmosphere. I'll never forget when Gary Sanchez hit a bases-clearing double or close to that (in the 2017 ALCS), and I honestly thought the stadium was going to fall over. It was loud.\"\n\nNo one will confuse Yankee Stadium with Minute Maid Park, but those folks can get awfully loud with the roof closed and 43,000 screaming fans waving orange towels all game.\n\nMasahiro Tanaka, who will start Game 1 for the Yankees, says he\u2019s already prepared for the crowd noise.\n\n\u201cOne thing I can say is that we\u2019ve been here in 2017,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe know what it\u2019s like in here. So I think that experience will definitely help going into the game.\u2019\u2019\n\nTHE X FACTOR\n\nZack Greinke.\n\nThe Astros made the biggest splash at the trade deadline by acquiring Greinke from the Diamondbacks, believing he would put them over the top. Greinke, a six-time All-Star, immediately delivered, going 8-1 with a 3.02 ERA, winding up with 18 victories.\n\nHe was hammered in his first postseason start in Game 3 of the Division Series, yielding six runs in 3 \u2154 innings, but now they need him the most. He\u2019ll be starting Game 1 simply because the Astros weren\u2019t about to start Verlander on short rest, and Cole pitched on Thursday.\n\n\u201cObviously, he didn\u2019t have the start he wanted, or we wanted in the Tampa series,\u2019\u2019 Astros outfielder Josh Reddick said, \u201cbut if there\u2019s anybody that doesn\u2019t show anything that fazes him, it\u2019s Zack Greinke. He\u2019s as cool and calm and collected as can be. I have all of the confidence in the world in him. He\u2019s done well against those guys this year (1-0, 2.13 ERA, with 14 strikeouts in 2 \u2154 innings in two starts).\n\n\u201cHe has the confidence and we have the confidence as well.\u2019\u2019\n\nIf Greinke gets into early trouble, Astros manager A.J. Hinch says, he\u2019ll still be given plenty of leeway to get out of it.\n\n\u201cAs far as margin of error,\u2019\u2019 Hinch said, \u201che\u2019s got the same margin for error that he\u2019s had for having a league-leading ERA the last few years, approaching 20 wins and Cy Youngs. And his margin for error the last 100 starts that he\u2019s made has been the same. What I\u2019ve learned over the last few years here is every pitcher has a smaller margin for error that you can possibly imagine against elite teams.\u2019\u2019\n\nIN THE END\n\nThe Yankees have a big, powerful, strong and scary starting lineup who can beat you 1-9. They led the major leagues with 943 runs with 306 homers, the second-most in MLB history.\n\nThe Astros have a big, powerful, strong and scary starting rotation who can beat you 1-3. The Astros struck out the most hitters in baseball, 1,671, and permitted the second-fewest runs (640).\n\nThe Yankees and Astros have met three times in the last five years in the postseason, and during those five years, the Astros lead the series, 22-20, with the Yankees outscoring then, 105-102.\n\nThis year, the Astros won four of seven games against the Yankees, winning all three at Minute Maid Park in April, while the Yankees won three of four at Yankee Stadium.\n\nSo the biggest difference in this series may be the fact the Astros have home-field advantage, just like in 2017, when they lost all three road games, but won all four games in Houston.\n\nThe Astros are trying to make history while the Yankees are trying to buck history.\n\nThe Yankees last won the World Series in 2009, and if they don\u2019t reach the World Series, it will be the first decade in franchise history they haven\u2019t played in the Fall Classic.\n\nASTROS IN 6.", "description": "This is the series America has been waiting for.
