And we didn\u2019t have him.\n\n\u201cHowever, Romelu as well was very committed today, he tried to do his best, and now let\u2019s hope he can leave these little issues behind him and be at his 100 per cent.\u201d\n\nLukaku was accused of being overweight towards the end of last season as he struggled for goals and impact at Old Trafford\n\nGary Neville was among those to criticise the striker, questioning his attitude and professionalism.\n\nAt the time Lukaku hit back at Neville, posting a topless photo to social media showing that he was very much in shape.\n\n\u201cHe [Neville] can talk about my fitness but he should never say anything about my professionalism, that I don\u2019t work hard enough,\u201d Lukaku said. \u201cThat is something he cannot say.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe new diet that Lukaku has adopted cuts out alcohol and fried foods. He has appeared leaner and quicker at the start of the new season, helping his club get off to a good start with three Serie A goals.\n\nInter Milan were knocked off the top of the table by Juventus after losing to their rivals.\n\nLautaro Martinez scored from the penalty spot but goals from Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain secured Juventus victory at the San Siro.", "description": "Inter Milan manager Antonio Conte has suggested that Romelu Lukaku needs to train more to keep his \u201cmassive body\u201d in shape.
