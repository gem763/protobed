In terms of plot, that\u2019s all there is to it. But when I say that those two men could be Captain Ahab from Moby Dick and Daniel Plainview from There Will Be Blood, and that they are trapped in what could be the holiday cottage from Withnail and I, and that their stir-craziness recalls Jack Torrance from The Shining, you\u2019ll get some sense of how exhilaratingly strange and violent their ordeal is.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Film review: The Irishman\n\n- Can cinema still shock?\n\n- Film review: Ad Astra\n\nSet in the late-19th Century, The Lighthouse is Eggers\u2019 second film, following his acclaimed debut, The Witch. Like that film, The Lighthouse balances horror and history: both dramas concern either the supernatural, or the psychological effects of being isolated in a remote, rugged setting. But The Lighthouse is a bolder and more skilful film. Some sequences build to such overwhelming intensity that you grip your seat as if you\u2019re on the deck of a sailing ship during a savage storm. You realise that absolutely anything could happen \u2013 that there is nowhere the story won\u2019t go and nothing the actors won\u2019t do.\n\nThe actors in question, almost the only people in the whole film, are Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe, who seem to be competing to see who can have the most gaunt and hollow face. Both of them could use their cheekbones as deadly weapons. Dafoe plays Thomas Wake, a veteran \u2018wickie\u2019 (lighthouse keeper) with a bushy beard, a clay pipe, a wooden leg and a plentiful supply of rum. Pattinson is Ephraim Winslow, a taciturn drifter who comes to Thomas\u2019s wave-bashed little island to help him tend to its squat lighthouse.\n\nWhen Ephraim starts glimpsing slimy monsters, it isn\u2019t clear if they are products of his fevered imagination or the lighthouse\u2019s mystic power, or both\n\nDuring their four-week stint together, far from the New England coast, they will have no one else for company except a flock of aggressive seagulls: the souls of dead seamen, insists Thomas. The cottage they share isn\u2019t too small, but they sleep side by side in a narrow garret room. You can tell that Ephraim is going to have a bad time when he first peeks into the room, bumps his head on the ceiling, and hears Thomas peeing into a chamber pot for what seems like ten straight minutes. The other bodily noises made by the old salt are repulsive, too, although none of them is as infuriating as what he says. He recites the same poetic toast before each of the men\u2019s evening meals (the rich archaic dialogue was drawn from Herman Melville\u2019s writings and from real lighthouse-keepers\u2019 journals). And after Ephraim has been slaving away for hours \u2013 wheelbarrowing coal through the lashing rain, hefting barrels of oil up the winding stairs \u2013 his boss will stomp up to him and bark: \u201cYou\u2019ve been neglecting your duties, lad!\u201d\n\nWavering drunkenly between tyrannical wrath and wheedling neediness, Thomas reveals that his previous right-hand man went mad and killed himself. And while Ephraim suspects that this mangy sea dog is spinning one of his tall tales, it certainly seems possible. There are moments when Ephraim warms to Thomas, and doesn\u2019t mind labouring on the lonely rock. But there are other moments when he loses track of time and reality. As if to add to his disorientation, the cinematographer, Jarin Blaschke, has shot the film in inky black and white, with an aspect ratio so narrow that the screen is pretty much square. The two lighthouse-keepers seem to be squeezed together, with darkness on either side of them. Then there is Mark Korven\u2019s music, which is not so much music as a deluge of unearthly throbs, squawks and groans, counterpointed by the cry of those pesky gulls and the deafening drone of the foghorn. When Ephraim starts glimpsing slimy monsters, it isn\u2019t clear if they are products of his fevered imagination or the lighthouse\u2019s mystic power, or both.\n\nThe Lighthouse is yet another example of Pattinson\u2019s willingness to take on the riskiest art-house projects he can\n\nCo-written by Eggers and his brother Max, the film doesn\u2019t have a conventional narrative or a neat resolution, but there is always something happening. Every scene includes another shocking discovery, another potentially crippling accident, another suspicious and possibly magical occurrence, so the viewer seems to be getting more and more pieces of an increasingly surreal puzzle, even if that puzzle is never quite complete. The Lighthouse is yet another example of Pattinson\u2019s willingness to take on the riskiest art-house projects he can \u2013 and the ones which make the most humiliating demands of him. I\u2019m not at all sure which accent he was going for, but there is no denying his goggle-eyed gusto, whether he is using a mermaid figurine as a masturbatory aid, or being soaked to the skin by sea spray (and worse).\n\nIt could all be too bizarre and alienating to bear if it weren\u2019t for one crucial factor: The Lighthouse is funny. Eggers balances its nightmarish grimness with humour in the bleak tradition of a British kitchen-sink sitcom, a Beckett play, and the aforementioned Withnail and I. You half-expect Ephraim to bleat, \u201cWe\u2019ve gone on lighthouse-keeping duty by mistake!\u201d And what a mistake it was.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nLove film?
