It's typhoon season here and you've got to be prepared for it.\n\n\"We had an idea it could happen and therefore you have to accumulate points in your games to put yourself in the right position in case that happened.\"\n\nJones said that his own team, who top Pool C with 17 points, wanted to make sure that their campaign was unaffected by external factors when they entered the tournament.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"We just knew that there was the possibility of a game like this during the tournament so we just wanted to put ourselves in the best position we could,\" he added.\n\n\"This is supposed to be a big typhoon, so I don't see any other option that the organisers had.\n\n\"That's why we're not concerned at all about the comings and goings of it, we think it's the right decision.\"\n\nWith Scotland currently third in Pool A, behind Japan and Ireland, they need a win against the hosts to have any chance of reaching the next round.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nCoach Townsend says he is hopeful Sunday's will go ahead, while Scottish Rugby has called on organisers to prepare \"contingency plans\" to ensure the match is played.\n\nA statement released on Thursday read: \u201cWe are in regular dialogue with World Rugby at all levels to work to ensure our fixture against Japan on Sunday can be played as planned. Public safety is the clear priority.\n\n\u201cWith potential impact on our last Pool A fixture, Scottish Rugby fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals on the pitch, and will be flexible to accommodate this.\u201d", "description": "Scotland's decisive Pool A match against Japan is currently under review as a result of Typhoon Hagibis", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Nasa Earth Observatory Handout Epa-Efe Rex", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20399569.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-Media-Access.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
