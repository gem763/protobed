But now I have to go as far as 40 km to come across a decent hunting ground,' said 61-year-old Matongu.\n\nWhen he goes hunting, he rents a dugout canoe and a couple of paddles, and packs a homemade rifle, a dozen cartridges and enough kwanga, a traditional bread made from cassava, to last a few days.\n\nHe stays in a cabin on a tributary of the Congo river and roams the forest day and night in search of whatever quarry he can find, including monkeys, forest antelopes, crocodiles, pythons and river hogs.\n\nOnce a month, Mohamed Esimbo Matongu (pictured) leaves his home in the western Congolese city of Mbandaka and hunts for wild animals\n\nMohamed Esimbo Matongu and his family eat the monkey that was killed in the forest, at their home in Mbandaka on April 5.

After a few days hunting in the forest, Matongu sells most of what he killed - making from 5,000 to 100,000 Congolese francs (around $7 to $60) - and keeps just enough meat for his family for a couple of days\n\nA poacher carrying bushmeat on his back is detained by park rangers in Salonga National Park on July 10, 2018\n\n'Our surveys show that animals from many species are disappearing around villages,' said Michel Bakanza, who works on community forests for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in Mbandaka.\n\nMany animals, including bonobo apes and pangolins, are protected by international law, but a lack of government oversight means these endangered species are regularly killed.\n\nPascal aims his gun at a monkey as he hunts in the forest near the city of Mbandaka\n\nMohamed Esimbo Matongu, Sadate and Papy return to their campsite empty-handed after a night of hunting\n\nPapy holds a baby red-tailed monkey which a hunter caught after killing its mother\n\nMohamed eviscerates a monkey that was killed by his cousin Pascal in the forest on April 4\n\nFishermen paddle along the Ruki river, a tributary to the Congo river, near the village of Bantoyi in the Democratic Republic of Congo on April 9, 2019\n\nMatongu says his monthly salary of about $75 is not enough to cover the needs of his wife, four daughters, two brothers and nephew who live under his roof.\n\n'How am I supposed to provide for so many people? Sometimes I don't even get paid at the end of the month,' he said. 'This is Congo: we try to do whatever we can to make it.'\n\nFor other hunters, like Celestin, a conservation student in Mbandaka who asked not to be named in full, the need to make ends meet in one of the world's poorest countries can override concerns about the animals.\n\nThree poachers sit on the floor after being detained by park rangers in Salonga National Park, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo on July 10\n\nMohamed Esimbo Matongu carries thatch, which he will use for the roof of his hut, back to his campsite which lies deep in the forest near the city of Mbandaka on April 3, 2018\n\nA man eats a python meat dish in a restaurant in Mbandaka on October 18\n\nA man cuts off the head of a crocodile he bought at the market before holding a barbecue with friends at his house in Kinshasa on December 9, 2018\n\nBoats filled with bushmeat arrive at Lingunda market on October 19, 2018.
