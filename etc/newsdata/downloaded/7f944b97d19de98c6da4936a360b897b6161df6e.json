The exchange \u201cwas most likely over\u201d, he said.\n\nHezbollah, the pro-Iran Lebanese militant group, claimed the attack. It said its fighters had destroyed an Israeli army vehicle near the frontier in the same area. It said it had killed and wounded people inside, contradicting Israeli claims.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if there had been casualties on the Lebanese side.\n\nTelevision channels in Israel said the army had ordered residents near the border to remain inside and for bomb shelters to be opened.\n\nIsraeli forces along the frontier have been bracing all week for a possible attack by Hezbollah. The organisation\u2019s leadership accused Israel of attempting to attack it with two drones last Sunday in its stronghold of southern Beirut.\n\nHezbollah\u2019s deputy leader had said his forces would launch a surprise retaliatory strike against Israel. \u201cI rule out that the atmosphere is one of war \u2013 it is one of a response to an attack,\u201d Sheikh Naim Qassem said in a TV interview on Tuesday night. \u201cEverything will be decided at its time.\u201d\n\nIsrael has not claimed the Beirut strikes, but two western diplomats said the rare operation may have been an assassination attempt or an effort to destroy equipment for fitting advanced guidance systems to rudimentary rockets.\n\nIsrael also said last week it had intelligence that Iran was helping Hezbollah to build guided missiles in Lebanon, something it said it would not tolerate. Guided missiles rather than the imprecise rockets it has used in the past would allow Hezbollah to target vital Israeli infrastructure in any future conflict.\n\nNeither Israel nor Hezbollah has expressed an interest in a return to war, having fought a deadly month-long conflict in 2006 that killed about 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and roughly 160 in Israel.\n\nThey have largely refrained from direct fighting for the past 13 years, save a few isolated flareups. Hezbollah fired an anti-tank missile in 2015 that killed two Israeli soldiers. Israel responded by shelling the area, killing a UN peacekeeping soldier.\n\nHowever, tensions between Israel and Iran, Hezbollah\u2019s founder and patron, have peaked recently and threatened to drag Lebanon and Israel into renewed conflict.\n\nThe Israeli air force has bombed Iranian military assets in Syria, saying its arch-enemy is using the country as a base to attack it.\n\nIt has also been accused of bombing Hezbollah forces operating in Syria, where the group is allied with the country\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. Until last week, Israel appeared to have avoided striking Hezbollah on home soil in Lebanon, fearing it may lead to reprisal attacks.\n\nFollowing Sunday\u2019s violence, Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, said the country was \u201cready and willing to defend Israel\u2019s citizens wherever they are, without hesitation. We are prepared and do not want to show just how well-prepared we are.\u201d\n\nIsrael positioned mannequins of soldiers in 4x4s along the Lebanon border this week as the army braced itself for an expected attack.\n\nHezbollah is a powerful Shia Islamist political and military organisation based in Lebanon that emerged as a force when Israel first invaded the country in the 1980s.", "description": "Tensions between Israel and Iran threaten to drag Lebanon into renewed conflict", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f66c31efb1f9f506946028c5df70c8a58d30de5/0_20_3827_2297/master/3827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c4c8dd54ea9518b33254e815a7db637e"}
