In the meantime, the Carpoffs and the Department of Justice agreed to hold an interlocutory sale and put the proceeds into a seized asset account, rather than continue to incur expenses for the storage and maintenance of the vehicles. The sale is being handled by the U.S. Marshals Service and Apple Auctioneering Co. in Woodland, Calif.\n\n\u201cIt is rare for the U.S. Marshals to hold an auction of such a stunning collection of vehicles,\u201d said Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Lasha Boyden of the Sacramento office.\n\nDC Solar was a NASCAR sponsor for some time, and the collection reflects an interest in gas-guzzling American performance cars old and new. Along with a 1969 Dodge Daytona and three 1970 Plymouth Superbirds, there\u2019s a 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon and six Ford Mustangs from the 1960s.\n\nNevertheless, there are two Teslas and five Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrids among the lots.\n\nThey also include plenty of vintage pickup trucks, four Hummer H1s and a 1965 Plymouth Fury LAPD tribute car, but it\u2019s one from the other side of the law that\u2019s the most unique model in the bunch.\n\nIt\u2019s a 1978 Pontiac Trans Am that\u2019s not just customized to look like the one from the \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d film, but was once owned by Burt Reynolds himself.\n\nOnline bidding for the cars is already underway and will run through a live event in Woodland on Oct. 26.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Conflicted history.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
