She sent me a photo of something that had just come up as my profile photo,' she told 9News.\n\nShe reported the hack to the Australian Federal Police - who told her the thieves may have used the ISIS flag to get the account deleted as quickly as possible.\n\nHer Instagram account, which was linked to her Facebook, was also deleted.\n\nIt was only after days of messaging the social media giants, as well an online petition and support from well-known blogger Constance Hall, that her accounts were restored.\n\nThe floral designer turned her hobby into a living when she started combining shells, flowers and gemstones to make an elegant goddess-style crown\n\n'I checked my Instagram accounts and they were both gone. It happened within seconds. It was really upsetting,' she said.\n\n'It just showed how quickly you can lose everything. It's like being fired from a job \u2026 it was pretty full on.'\n\nMs Shiels sells her head garlands as well as decorated sunglasses for between $168 and $550 on online marketplace Etsy.\n\nThe hackers took control of her account and changed her profile picture to terrorist organisation ISIS' black-and-white flag (pictured), causing Facebook to delete her account\n\nThe designer, who has 177,000 followers on Instagram, was refunded the $420 and Instagram also admitted they had made an error.\n\nA Facebook spokesman said they restored access to Ms Sheils' account as soon as they could - while verifying it was really her.\n\n'We're committed to safeguarding the integrity of our services, and work hard to protect our community from hackers, fake accounts and other inauthentic behaviour,' the spokesperson said.\n\n'I got a message from my cousin which said, 'I think you've been hacked'. She sent me a photo of something that had just come up as my profile photo,' she said\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted Instagram and Facebook for further comment.\n\nIn 2016 Ms Shiels told Daily Mail Australia she started selling her crowns after overcoming her shyness to turn her talent into a living.\n\n'I was so nervous what people would think, though. Like, why would you wear shells on your head, right?' she said.", "description": "Gold Coast florist Chelsea Shiels makes elegant goddess-style crowns - but saw her livelihood disappear after hackers broke into her social media accounts earlier this month.", "authors": ["Charlie Co\u00eb For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/04/20311562-0-image-a-52_1572324899838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
