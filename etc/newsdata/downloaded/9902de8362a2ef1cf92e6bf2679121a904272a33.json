A further four, representing northern Leave-voting seats, abstained.\n\nJust six Labour MPs defied the party whip to support the Government, with a further four abstaining\n\nBoris Johnson vowed not to 'negotiate a delay' to Brexit today after his moment of triumph on a deal was dramatically snatched away.\n\nDespite frantic efforts, the PM failed to fend off the amendment tabled by former Cabinet minister Sir Oliver, which prevented his new package being put to a formal vote this afternoon.\n\nMr Johnson now faces being compelled by the Benn Act to ask the EU for a Brexit extension tonight - but he defiantly insisted he would not change his stance.\n\nResponding to the result, he raged: 'The best thing for the UK and for the whole of Europe is for us to leave with this new deal on October 31.\n\n'I will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so.'\n\nHe added: 'No delays, and I will continue to do all I can to get Brexit done on October 31.'\n\nMr Johnson said his deal is not dead and he is expected to bring forward implementation legislation and hold a new vote on Tuesday.\n\nHe swiped: 'The meaningful vote has been voided of meaning.'\n\nBut Jeremy Corbyn demanded the PM 'obeys the law' and asked the EU for an extension. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson urged Speaker John Bercow to suspend the sitting so the PM could go and write the letter, and return to inform them it can be sent.\n\nGovernment whips had admitted they were not hopeful of defeating the Letwin amendment - which he insists is only intended to stave off the threat of No Deal.
