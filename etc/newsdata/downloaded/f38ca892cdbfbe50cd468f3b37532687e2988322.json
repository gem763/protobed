Making constant submissions covering the same issues to the minister is inefficient and onerous,\" Allsop said.\n\nIn its own submission to the committee, Telstra said some agencies have skirted the metadata laws and are not paying for access. The incumbent telco also questioning whether the regime was operating effectively in its submission.\n\nGenerally agreeing with the submission by the Communications Alliance, Telstra echoed that non-enforcement agencies often request large amounts of data and are unable to interpret it.\n\nTelstra added that non-enforcement agencies might not be encrypting data received from telcos.\n\n\"We believe there is a need for the introduction of appropriate oversight mechanisms to ensure measures are in place to securely protect disclosed data and to control who can/can't access the data,\" Telstra said.\n\nIn July, ACT Policing confessed that it found 3,249 extra times it accessed metadata without proper authorisation during 2015, on top of the 116 requests disclosed earlier in the year.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "ATO claims a lack of access to retained metadata of Australians has impacted its criminal cases to the tune of an average AU$10,770 per investigation.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/25/e016d370-e69b-4995-b2e2-d4c46794fdc6/thumbnail/770x578/517e1e046d719e40ff3ad7e486be2447/data-protection-and-cyber-security.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
