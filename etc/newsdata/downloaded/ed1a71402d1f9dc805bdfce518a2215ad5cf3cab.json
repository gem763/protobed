Furthermore, companies are prohibited from using blockchain to \u201cproduce, duplicate, publish, or disseminate\u201d any data that could be declared a threat to national security.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported previously, the Chinese regulator\u2019s first list of registered blockchain service providers included 197 companies and was published on March 30.", "description": "The Cyberspace Administration of China adds 309 more companies to its list of registered blockchain service providers", "authors": ["Liam Frost"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZWYxMjdhOTQ5ZTcxMjQ4MjMzNzlmOGRkY2Q0NzM2ZmUuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
