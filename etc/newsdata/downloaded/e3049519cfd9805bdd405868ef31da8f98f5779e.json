He added that it might prove useful to Trump \u201cwhen you formulate climate policy\u201d to a bit of laughter and applause on the General Assembly floor.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the Climate Action Summit on Monday by saying: \u201cEarth is issuing a chilling cry: Stop.\u201d\n\nGuterres told world leaders that it\u2019s not a time to negotiate but to act to make the world carbon neutral by 2050. He wants to limit global temperature increases to a few more tenths of a degree, and he said the world can do it.\n\nMore than 60 world leaders are set to speak, kicking off with leaders from New Zealand, the hard-hit Marshall Islands, India and Germany.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Tackling the climate peril will grab the spotlight as world leaders gather for their annual meeting at the United Nations this week.", "authors": ["Edith M.
