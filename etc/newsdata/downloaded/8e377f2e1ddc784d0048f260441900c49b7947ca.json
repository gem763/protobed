She is a fugitive from this country and she is on the run.\n\n\"We appeal to her to come back to this country and face the music.\"\n\nMr Seiger also questioned if Ms Sacoolas was entitled to diplomatic immunity through family links, adding: \"This person, whoever he is, was not a diplomat and therefore does not have the benefit of diplomatic immunity and nor does his family.\n\n\"The other thing that we are going to be doing shortly is, unfortunately, referring Northamptonshire Police to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.\n\n\"Although they (Northamptonshire Police) have not disclosed all the information this family are entitled to, we have deep concerns about the manner in which this investigation was conducted, and simply adding insult to injury to this family at their darkest hour.\"\n\n(Image: SKY NEWS)\n\nThe news comes as the row over the Foreign Office\u2019s handling of the case deepened earlier this week over claims a legal \u00adloophole allowed Ms Sacoolas to obtain diplomatic immunity.\n\nIn 1995, the UK agreed all US staff and their families at RAF Croughton spy base would be protected from prosecution under the Vienna Convention.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab revealed on Tuesday that this was later dropped for workers but records were not changed for spouses so they were still protected.\n\nHe described it as an \u201canomaly\u201d and ordered an urgent review.\n\nShadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry, who met Harry's parents, said: \u201cWe smell a rat, and we need to find out what really happened. It is dubious and concerning that Mrs Sacoolas was able to claim full diplomatic immunity.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe FCO and CPS should have \u00adchallenged the legal basis of her immunity, rather than just blaming it on an anomaly.\u201d\n\nMs Sacoolas told police she was entitled to immunity.\n\nThe Foreign Office asked for it to be waived on September 5 but the US refused and she flew home on September 16. Police did not inform Harry\u2019s family until a week later.\n\nChief Constable Nick Adderley claimed the Foreign Office asked him to delay telling the family while officials worked out the \u201clegal steps\u201d.\n\nA Foreign Office spokesman told Mirror Online: \u201cWe have done everything we can properly to clear a path so that justice can be done for Harry\u2019s family.\n\n\"As the Foreign Secretary set out in Parliament, the individual involved had diplomatic immunity whilst in the country under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. We will respond to any legal action in due course.\u201d", "description": "Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn have instructed a top-level legal team to review how son Harry's case was handled after suspect Anne Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity and left the country", "authors": ["Amber Hicks", "Image", "Reach Plc", "Reuters", "Pa", "Sky News", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20642174.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS194969190.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
