Berger was detained and shot during the Pinochet era.\n\n\"The desert returned to us pieces of his back and his jaw,\" Hertz wrote in a grim post on Twitter, adding that \"his murderers have enjoyed decades of impunity.\"", "description": "Thousands of demonstrators poured into the streets of Santiago on Sunday to honor the victims of General Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, in a march that started peacefully but ended in violence.
