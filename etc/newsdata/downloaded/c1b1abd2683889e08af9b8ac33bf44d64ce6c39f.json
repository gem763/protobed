She\u2019s been living off of bologna sandwiches, instant noodles and frozen vegetables.\n\n\u201cI try to make salads, but the lettuce or spinach I buy goes bad really quickly and these days a thing of lettuce is shockingly expensive, same with a bag of spinach,\u201d she writes. \u201cEven freaking cucumber is expensive now.\u201d\n\nHer post \u201cWhat are poor people meals that won\u2019t help me gain weight?\u201d has become a veritable recipe book of budget shopping tips and cooking hacks, as hundreds of readers have weighed in over the last 24 hours.\n\nRelated: You spend 41% more at the supermarket if you keep checking your phone\n\nMany suggest making swaps, such as exchanging the quick-to-spoil spinach and lettuce for cabbage. Many comments highlighted the humble green\u2019s versatility as a base in salads and slaws, not to mention as a taco or sandwich topping, or simply drizzled in olive oil and roasted as a side dish. \u201cIt lasts practically forever and is inexpensive\u201d is the general consensus.\n\nSeveral Redditors also called for ditching the bologna slices for chicken. \u201cLunchmeat is expensive,\u201d wrote one, while chicken is generally a cheaper form of lean protein that can be more filling (and certainly less salty than processed deli meat.) Chicken is also known for being versatile, and the poultry use suggestions have poured in: steaming or saut\u00e9ing the chicken breasts; roasting the legs and thighs; slicing cheap cuts up for stir fry and fajitas; or baking the whole bird and using the carcass as a base for soups.\n\nSome other common ingredients that crop up over and over again include proteins like beans and eggs, carbs like rice and oatmeal, as well as frozen vegetables and potatoes. Several also suggested shopping at the Germany-based discount grocery chain Aldi, which has been expanding across the U.S., citing 69-cent cucumbers and $1.19 bags of spinach.\n\nKeri Glassman, a registered dietitian and founder of Nutritious Life, also gives staples such as frozen vegetables, brown rice, eggs, canned salmon and legumes (beans and chickpeas) a thumbs-up. \u201cThey\u2019re inexpensive, can be bought in bulk, last a long time so they won\u2019t go to waste, and they\u2019re nutrient-dense,\u201d she told MarketWatch.\n\nRelated: How prescribing healthy food could save billions of dollars in health-care costs\n\nAnd many of the comments suggested taking advantage of services such as local food banks and food pantries, as well as unemployment benefits and SNAP (the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program). \u201cPlease don\u2019t feel you can\u2019t use a food bank or food stamps,\u201d said one user, who had used food stamps while unemployed for 10 months in 2009. \u201cPay it forward when you are back on your feet.\u201d\n\nOthers cited online resources such as Reddit\u2019s r/eatcheapandhealthy and r/eatcheapandvegan threads, and many called out the BudgetBytes.com blog, which lays out the cost per meal for every recipe.\n\nIndeed, Budget Bytes founder Beth Moncel recently dished out some of her own lean budget tricks for MarketWatch, such as freezing leftover ingredients and using them as creative pizza toppings or sandwich fillings. After all, the U.S. tosses out up to 40% of its food every year, amounting to $165 billion in food waste, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council \u2014 even as one in eight Americans struggles to put food on the table.\n\nMoncel also centers her meals around cheap and filling (yet still nutritious) staples like sweet potatoes, beans and lentils that she can buy in bulk. She also stocks up on basic, inexpensive vegetables such as cabbage, potatoes, onions, bell peppers and carrots \u2014 but she dresses them up with small splurges such as cheeses, nuts and meats to satisfy her taste buds.

But grocery tabs aren\u2019t rising nearly as fast as the cost of eating out. So these tips and tricks make great budget hacks even if you\u2019re not strapped for cash \u2014 especially considering one in five Americans isn\u2019t saving any money at all.", "description": "Here\u2019s what Reddit users and nutrition experts say she should eat on a budget", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT538_grocer_ZG_20191017133322.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
