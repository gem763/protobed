It\u2019s what helped him \u2013 and his team \u2013 survive an abysmal start this season and eventually capture a playoff berth.\n\nThe Nationals were coming off back-to-back first-round flameouts when Martinez replaced Dusty Baker \u2013 who himself inherited a club that failed to advance in its two previous postseason appearances.\n\nWashington\u2019s reputation was such that being 0-4 all-time in National League Division Series shared equal billing with its four NL East titles in six years.\n\nSensing a team under pressure last year, in his first spring training as a manager, Martinez sought to replace the steam with a cool breeze. He instilled a light and loose tone, heavy on fun. There were team relay races, walk-off practices and golf-chipping contests. There was a Circle of Trust, a la \u201cMeet the Parents,\u201d including skits and funny speeches.\n\nOf all the gimmicks Martinez implemented, none was more noteworthy than the three camels. He brought them to camp so his team could face the elephant in the clubhouse, the Nationals\u2018 inability to get \u201cover the hump\u201d and win a playoff series.\n\n\u201cMy intentions were to bring the hump to us \u2013 the proverbial hump question that we all try to answer,\u201d Martinez told reporters that day in February 2018. \u201cFor me, as I thought about it, the hump is every day. And I want them to embrace it, not fear it. And have fun with it.\n\n\u201cWe all know why we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nThe answer, then and now, remains the same. Ownership and general manager Mike Rizzo confirmed as much upon hiring Martinez, and the rookie manager bought into the thought process during his introductory news conference. \u201cWe\u2019re not here just to win a playoff game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to win the World Series.\u201d\n\nNo pressure, there, huh?\n\nMartinez\u2019s attempts to make the Nationals an easy-going, laid-back bunch didn\u2019t bear fruit last year, as they failed to reach the playoffs and barely topped .500 (82-80). When his second season featured 31 losses in the first 50 games, questions about his suitability for the job were rampant.\n\nStaying loose and having fun doesn\u2019t quite jibe with a .380 winning percentage.\n\nBut Martinez and the Nationals pulled it off until consistent victories made the task simple.\n\nThe skipper can never receive enough credit for keeping morale high while losses piled up, leading observers to call for his dismissal and a fire sale. Newcomers like Gerardo Parra, Asdrubal Cabrera and Brian Dozier helped by providing levity and veteran savvy, complementing the youthful exuberance of Juan Soto and Victor Robles. After faltering in early September, the Nationals ripped through the season\u2019s most intense segment, winning their last eight games and 12 of their last 15.\n\nConsidering that several prognostications tabbed Washington for the World Series, winning a wild card could be viewed as underachieving. Then again, reaching the playoffs at all is a massive accomplishment for a club that was a dozen games under .500 in late May.\n\n\u201cNo matter how you start, the objective is to get to the postseason,\u201d Martinez told reporters Sunday after the regular-season finale. \u201cThe boys did that. We can all sit here and say it was ugly in the beginning, but they stepped up and endured a lot, and we\u2019re going to the postseason.\u201d\n\nThat typically would force the franchise to face its NLDS demons.\n\nBut there\u2019s no guarantee of even accepting that challenge, not with the red-hot Milwaukee Brewers (13-5 down the stretch) in town for Tuesday\u2019s winner-take-all wild card game. Washington clinched home-field advantage on Friday, which historically has offered no edge: The Nationals are 4-4 in playoff games on the road.\n\nThey\u2019re 3-8 in playoff games at Nationals Park.\n\nWashington can begin rewriting its history by beating Milwaukee. That would qualify as advancing in the postseason \u2013 a first for the Nationals \u2013 even though it wouldn\u2019t meet the standard for winning a playoff series. They\u2019d have to topple the two-time defending NL champion Los Angeles Dodgers to remove that unwelcome asterisk.\n\nGiven everything they\u2019ve been through, the Nationals are more than capable of fulfilling preseason expectations. They\u2019re positioned to deliver a return on their manager\u2019s investment, the months devoted to building a relaxed and resilient culture.\n\nHowever, Tuesday\u2019s matchup doesn\u2019t represent the obstacle Martinez had in mind when he brought three camels to spring training last season. The wild card game is a start.\n\nBut it\u2019s also just a hindrance before the hump.\n\nBrooklyn-born and Howard-educated, Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
