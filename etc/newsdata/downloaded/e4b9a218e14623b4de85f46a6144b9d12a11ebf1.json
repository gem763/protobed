The book was first announced in June 2019.\n\nThe initial worldwide print run for the English version of the book will be 2.5 million copies, the books' Canadian publisher, Scholastic Canada, said in a press release.\n\nCollins said in June 2019 that she would go back to the years following the so-called \"Dark Days,\" the failed rebellion in Panem. Collins set the Hunger Games books in a post-apocalyptic dystopia where young people must fight and kill each other, on live television.\n\n\"With this book, I wanted to explore the state of nature, who we are, and what we perceive is required for our survival,\" she said. \"The reconstruction period 10 years after the war, commonly referred to as the Dark Days \u2014 as the country of Panem struggles back to its feet \u2014 provides fertile ground for characters to grapple with these questions and thereby define their views of humanity.\"\n\nThe first three Hunger Games books \u2014 The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay \u2014 have sold more than 100 million copies and have been translated into more than 50 languages.\n\nCollins has cited her father as a reason for her lifelong studies of war, and cited both contemporary and classical culture as inspirations for The Hunger Games. She named the country Panem as a reference to the Roman expression \"panem et circenses,\" meaning bread and circuses, diversions for the masses.\n\nIn a 2010 interview with the Associated Press, she recalled watching television one night, switching channels, and becoming momentarily disoriented by going back and forth between a reality program and the Iraq War.\n\n\"We have so much programming coming at us all the time. Is it too much? Are we becoming desensitized to the entire experience?\" she said.\n\n\"Dystopian stories are places where you can play out the scenarios in your head \u2014 your anxieties \u2014 and see what might come of them. And, hopefully, as a young person, with the possibilities of the future waiting for you, you're thinking about how to head these things off.\"\n\nWith files from the Associated Press.", "description": "The fourth title in the bestselling series is a prequel, set 64 years before the original trilogy.
