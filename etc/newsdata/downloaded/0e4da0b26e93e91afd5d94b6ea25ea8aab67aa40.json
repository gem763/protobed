Early in their new book, Justice on Trial, Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino inform us that the future justice was a habitual church-goer. He was so committed, in fact, that he served as a lector in his local parish. On the day that would change his life, Providence had queued up a timely Scripture reading for Mass. It was Second Corinthians 12:7\u201310. In this passage, the Apostle Paul recounts the tribulations he has suffered for the Lord: \u201cI am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and constraints, for the sake of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am strong.\u201d\n\nThus Hemingway and Severino signal their purpose early: Justice on Trial is not a work of balanced reporting, as Hemingway, a senior editor at The Federalist insists. Severino, her co-author, is a former clerk for Clarence Thomas and the chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network \u2014 the same organization behind confirmkavanaugh.com, which was set up in 2018 to defend the nominee. The book serves much the same purpose as JCN\u2019s old website. It sets out to exonerate not just Kavanaugh but the president who nominated him. If the press is willing to smear Kavanaugh with tales of sexual misconduct, reports of Trump\u2019s sexual violence become that much more difficult to believe. And so their Trump is a thoughtful man, committed to originalist interpretations of the Constitution. They even make his White House look functional, which is a feat. Kavanaugh, meanwhile, nearly glows with sainthood. At Georgetown Prep, we learn, the justice was a diligent student. At Yale, he was a virginal intellectual. If he drank too much sometimes, it was only because he worked so hard. The poor boy just needed a release. When he tried to woo his wife, Ashley, she almost rejected him \u2014 but not because he was a creep! No, he was almost too nice for his own good.\n\nIt\u2019s dreck, all of it. Nobody\u2019s so spotless that an investigation of his or her life would be universally positive. Even public figures who aren\u2019t moral monsters must own moments of cruelty or at least incompetence. And here, Hemingway and Severino\u2019s reportage of the inner workings of the White House is a tell. We know the Trump White House is dysfunctional, prone to leaks and staff turnover and surprise executive decisions announced on Twitter. None of these qualities appear in their book. As for Kavanaugh himself, he may well have been as studious as the authors claim. But it\u2019s his character, not his study habits, that are in question, and on those grounds, he becomes much trickier to defend. It\u2019s at least evident that he misled the Senate about the extent of his drinking problems in college and high school, to say nothing of the statistical rarity of false assault accusations. Assuming, generously, that Severino and Hemingway did seek to fairly report the story of the confirmation fight, it\u2019s clear that neither had sources willing to criticize Kavanaugh, and neither questioned whether the story they put together might possibly be skewed. But really, who expected anything better from Hemingway? She flipped from Trump skeptic to Trump superfan almost as soon as the president took office. This isn\u2019t hypocrisy but a professional calculation; it\u2019s difficult to be a conservative media critic in opposition to a Republican president, especially one who\u2019s constantly in the news for public acts of corruption. Her principal occupation since January 2017 has been to defend his administration at all costs on Fox and at The Federalist. It\u2019s busy work, but she carries out her responsibilities with gusto.\n\nTrump, as always, recognizes a job well done:\n\nGreat new book, \u201cJustice On Trial, The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court.\u201d Fantastic job by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2019\n\nBut the fantastical character of Justice on Trial is not a reason to dismiss it. It matters for what its contents tell us about conservative media in the era of Trump. Though Hemingway and Severino try to undermine the women who accused Kavanaugh of misconduct, the women themselves are secondary casualties. The authors work toward a goal bigger than Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s individual ruin. They want to discredit the press itself, an ambition with an additional benefit for commentators like Hemingway: It\u2019s much easier to convince the public to listen to you, to prioritize you, if your competitors are all fake news.\n\nAs Hemingway and Severino tell it, journalists were so eager to discredit Kavanaugh that they latched onto any thin proof of his sins. Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s memory was so shoddy, her account so \u201cimprobable,\u201d they write, that Kavanaugh\u2019s innocence should have been obvious to all. And Ford herself was no innocent. In fact, classmates say her school nickname was \u201ca riff on her maiden name and a sexual act,\u201d the authors state. The implication \u2013 that Ford was slutty, and therefore difficult to believe \u2013 is as rancid as it is obvious. Ford\u2019s own father is pleased that Kavanaugh is on the court, they\u2019ve since reported. Leland Keyser, Ford\u2019s high school friend, doesn\u2019t recall the party where Ford says Kavanaugh assaulted her. She says doesn\u2019t even remember Kavanaugh, despite going out with his best friend, and doesn\u2019t believe he assaulted Ford. Deborah Ramirez, who says that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a Yale party, isn\u2019t credible either, the authors insist. Her classmates said her story was bunk and she was drunk, a double blow. \u201cRamirez admitted that she \u2018quickly became inebriated,\u2019 at the party, ending up \u2018on the floor, foggy and slurring her words,\u201d they write. Some drinking problems, evidently, matter more than others.\n\nThe narrative thread that binds Justice on Trial together is that of media failure. The New Yorker\u2019s Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow reported Ramirez\u2019s story \u201cin a breathless style that gave it a sense of significance, even though it betrayed more than a hint of desperation.\u201d Unnamed reporters \u201chounded\u201d Kavanaugh\u2019s female defenders; the Times and the Washington Post became \u201cthe public-relations arm of the anti-Kavanaugh movement.\u201d As Hemingway and Severino are at least pretending to see it, the press united in an effort to block Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court. To accomplish its objective, it smeared him, just as previous generations of reporters had done to Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork. (Bork\u2019s son even contributed a blurb for the book.) The complete effect is that of a Jon McNaughton painting: a muscular, beatific Kavanaugh standing athwart the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh, Trump, and conservatives in general all stand in the center of a gathering mob. Around them stands the liberal press, ready to martyr Paul all over again.\n\nThe press is not always its own best ally. As Hemingway and Severino note, the Washington Post did erroneously report that Kavanaugh\u2019s beleaguered alma mater, Georgetown Prep, had published a job ad for a new director of alumni relations in October, well after the media onslaught began; in fact, the school had listed the job in July. And when Michael Avenatti, erstwhile attorney to the stars, introduced his new client, Julie Swetnick, some columnists did seize on the story as further evidence of Kavanaugh\u2019s failings. Swetnick told a terrible story \u2014 that Kavanaugh had spiked the punch at a party so other boys could gang-rape her and other girls in attendance. But the story later collapsed, as Swetnick eventually contradicted parts of her own statement and an alleged witness told NBC that Avenatti had \u201ctwisted her words.\u201d These failures give conservative commentators like Hemingway an important opening.\n\nSo did the Times\u2019 recent publication of an excerpt from another book on the Kavanaugh confirmation. Published by two of its own reporters, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh helped corroborate Ramirez\u2019s account of misconduct and confirmed earlier reports that the FBI had failed to investigate key tips about Kavanaugh\u2019s behavior. They also reported for the first time that a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh and Ramirez \u2014 Max Stier, founder of the Partnership for Public Service \u2014 had told the FBI about another possible Kavanaugh incident. The future justice allegedly exposed himself to a second woman, Tracy Harmon Joyce.\n\nAnd if you\u2019d read only the section published by the Times, that\u2019s really all you\u2019d know. But it wasn\u2019t the full story. The excerpt omitted some key details that appear earlier in the book: that Harmon Joyce, a close friend of Ramirez, had declined to speak to Pogrebin and Kelly and that \u201cseveral\u201d of her friends said she did not recall the event.\n\nCue Hemingway.\n\nBOMBSHELL: New York Times corrects Kavanaugh smear to note alleged victim does not recall any such incident. pic.twitter.com/yigeOyOCzo \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 16, 2019\n\nHemingway even dismissed the excerpt\u2019s characterization of Ramirez as a Yale outsider from a working-class background:\n\nI\u2019m now reading about how a woman raised in Connecticut WHO WENT TO YALE lacked privilege. I get the authors are super-elites but uh ....this rural Colorado girl who went to a state school on her own dime would like a word. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s self-evident that the yacht-faring residents of Greenwich do not represent the whole of Connecticut. The town of New Haven itself is heavily working-class, which is apparent to anyone who visits it and spends more than ten minutes off the Yale campus. The paper\u2019s update, meanwhile, didn\u2019t correct a reporting error, so it\u2019s not much of a bombshell. It simply included information located elsewhere in the excerpted book. But the Times wounded itself, its reporters, and Ramirez herself by publishing that section over other possibilities. The story became a story about standards at the Times. The paper delivered Hemingway her talking points in a gift-wrapped package.\n\nBut these instances of press failure do not necessarily support the sweeping assertion made by Hemingway and Severino that the press, in its liberal zeal, categorically botched its coverage of the Kavanaugh hearing. The examples they offer as proof are not really as damning as they say. Plenty of news outlets produced sober-minded coverage of the Swetnick story, though Hemingway and Severino omit those details from their book. They criticize NBC for running a story on a Facebook post created by a high-school classmate of Blasey Ford\u2019s. The classmate, Cristina King Miranda, claimed the assault \u201cDID happen\u201d as she heard about it at the time. She later deleted her post after clarifying that she had no firsthand knowledge of the attack. \u201cThat it happened or not, I have no idea,\u201d she told NPR. NBC, Hemingway and Severino insist, erred by covering Miranda\u2019s post after she had deleted it, under the following headline: \u201cAccuser\u2019s Schoolmate Says She Recalls Hearing of Alleged Kavanaugh Incident.\u201d But that\u2019s an accurate headline, and the story itself makes no explosive claims. In fact, the story states outright that NBC could not confirm Miranda\u2019s story, and the claim itself was newsworthy.\n\nThe real story of the Kavanaugh confirmation isn\u2019t so easy to dismiss. The Harmon Joyce story isn\u2019t just newsworthy because of what it suggests about Kavanaugh\u2019s behavior at Yale. The life cycle of this subplot does not end with Stier\u2019s recollection but with the FBI\u2019s failure to investigate the tip. And this is a key difference between the books. Pogrebin and Kelly don\u2019t dispute the fact that many of Kavanaugh\u2019s friends and professional acquaintances rave about him. Or that Avenatti, to cite another example in both books, accomplished significantly more harm than good. What Pogrebin and Kelly make clear instead is that Kavanaugh\u2019s protectors had more power than his detractors. The Establishment didn\u2019t victimize Kavanaugh; it protected him, just as it had protected Thomas from Anita Hill more than two decades ago. Bork, the book\u2019s other example of liberal overreach, was less fortunate, but his record makes him a uniquely difficult character to defend. As Jane Coaston noted for Vox last year, the failed Supreme Court nominee once \u201cruled that making sterilization a policy for a job didn\u2019t violate the Occupational Safety and Health Act,\u201d and wrote that the Civil Rights Act of 1963 expressed \u201ca principle of unsurpassed ugliness.\u201d Some things even the U.S. Senate can\u2019t stomach \u2014 at least, it couldn\u2019t back then. If Bork has his defenders now, perhaps that\u2019s a sign that his nomination would fare much differently if it occurred today.\n\nBy the time of his martyrdom, Paul helped fling a new faith across the face of a changing world. Kavanaugh is no martyr. He rose to a worldlier form of power. But in its own way, the story of his nomination helps shape another, secularized faith. Its ambitions are radical. In Justice on Trial, Hemingway and Severino insist with the conviction of disciples that conservatives are victims of a press and Democratic party without scruples. Conservative media is a necessary corrective force, they suggest. To them, investigation is unwelcome and criticism unwarranted. They accept without question the version of events furnished by the Trump White House; they do not question the official narrative once in their 300-plus-page book. They give the appearance, then, that they accept Kavanaugh\u2019s suitability as if it were received wisdom, and they proceed from that basis \u2014 an anti-democratic impulse that brings their attacks on the press into focus. Good people, they write, may still volunteer for public service because they believe the wicked press will spare them a smear campaign. \u201cBut it can happen, it does happen, and it just happened,\u201d they warn. \u201cThe big unknown is whether America will let it happen again.\u201d Hemingway and Severino would rather \u201cit\u201d didn\u2019t. They prefer gentle coverage, a tamed public square.
