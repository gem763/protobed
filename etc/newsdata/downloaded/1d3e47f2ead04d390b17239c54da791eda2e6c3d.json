The map \u201csays to me he has more support from cows than people,\u201d sniffs the longtime Democratic strategist Tad Devine. \u201cIt\u2019s not a representation of the population of the United States. It is a classic example of how he tries to mislead people.\u201d\n\nMaps that measure the 2016 result by population\u2014particularly the so-called prism map that displays huge vertical bars over the major urban centers that backed Clinton\u2014show the nation much more evenly balanced. That reflects the reality that while Trump won far more counties, Clinton won substantially more votes\u2014nearly 3 million more in total, a margin roughly equal to President George W. Bush\u2019s popular-vote victory in 2004.\n\n(ArcGIS)\n\nBut those aren\u2019t the only options for measuring the red-blue divide. While the population maps show a close partisan split, a map tying the election results to economic vitality would tilt toward Democrats nearly as much as the county map leans toward Republicans. Although Clinton carried fewer than one-sixth of the nation\u2019s counties, the places she won in 2016 accounted for nearly two-thirds of the nation\u2019s total economic output, according to calculations by the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.\n\nEach of these maps reveals a different aspect of the same larger story: a widening geographic, demographic, and economic separation between a Republican Party centered on the places that reflect what America has been and a Democratic Party rooted in the places that embody what it is becoming.\n\nRead: The real culprit behind geographic polarization\n\nWith Trump on the ticket, as these maps suggest, the GOP has consolidated its control over exurban areas, small towns, and rural communities still heavily reliant on agriculture, energy production, and manufacturing\u2014the powerhouse industries of the 20th century. But that dominance has come at the price of bleeding support in bustling urban centers and inner suburbs leading the transition into the 21st-century information-age economy. The 2018 midterm elections showed the same pattern, as Democrats snatched a majority in the House by making sweeping gains in metropolitan areas but barely dented the Republican fortress in nonmetro America.\n\nAt both the presidential and congressional level, write Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton of Brookings in a recent study, \u201cthe Democratic Party is now anchored in the nation\u2019s booming, but highly unequal, metro areas, while the GOP relies on aging and economically stagnant manufacturing-reliant rural and exurban communities.\u201d\n\nOver time, this geographic realignment will benefit Democrats, because those metropolitan centers are growing in population and especially in economic clout as the nation transitions into the information-age economy. But in the near term, the trench between metro and nonmetro America that\u2019s been widened by Trump is creating anxieties for both sides. It reduces the odds of Republicans winning the presidential popular vote or a majority in the House of Representatives. Simultaneously, it diminishes the Democrats\u2019 chances of controlling the Senate and many state legislatures, and leaves them with only a narrow pathway to an Electoral College majority.", "description": "Dirt doesn\u2019t vote.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX2NONC/facebook.jpg?1570117239"}
