We have to make ourselves stronger and make friends with the world to face this problem together.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong protesters are furious at what they see as creeping Chinese interference in the former British colony, which returned to China in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland for 50 years.\n\nChina says it is committed to the arrangement and denies meddling. It has also suggested the same formula for Taiwan, which it considers a recalcitrant, breakaway province.\n\n\"If Taiwan doesn\u2019t care about its democracy and its freedom and sacrifices its own future to do business in China, I think it is very likely that Taiwan will find itself in a similar situation,\" Ko said.\n\n(Writing by Nick Macfie; Editing by Bernadette Baum)", "description": "A church in Taiwan said on Wednesday it had collected more than 4,000 gas masks and 600 helmets to send to anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, saying the fight for democracy was crucial in the face of increased meddling by Beijing.
