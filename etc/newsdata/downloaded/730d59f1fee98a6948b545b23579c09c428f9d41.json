I\u2019m already familiar with the contents.\n\nIndeed, the whole world knows what\u2019s inside \u2014 the gist of it, anyway, which is compiled from readily accessible public information. Still, the way Kane pushes the file toward me, fingers outstretched, has a cinematic flair. It\u2019s as if the drab Excel sheets inside constitute a bombshell.\n\nIn a way, they do. The neatly arranged columns of numbers break down the vote in Wisconsin in the 2016 election, when American politics exploded. A small number of Americans living in the upper Midwest, about 78,000 across three states, detonated a bomb that\u2019s still rattling the world.\n\nAlmost 3 million voters in Wisconsin cast ballots for president in 2016. Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the state by 22,748 \u2014 a margin of about three-quarters of 1%. The election was so narrow that either Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate for president, or Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, might\u2019ve tripped the state results. Johnson received 106,674 votes, and Stein 31,072.\n\nKane and I are in an Italian restaurant 5 miles east of the Mississippi River, just outside La Crosse, Wisconsin. Of Wisconsin\u2019s 72 counties, 23 switched from voting for Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016. Half a dozen of those pivot counties are here in southwestern Wisconsin near the river. If you follow the Mississippi south, you pass a series of counties in northwest Iowa that similarly switched from Democrat to Republican in 2016.\n\nSomething went awry in this region. Understanding what it was has been a near-obsession for Democrats such as Kane, who want to ensure the calamity is not repeated. A former Democratic politician in both Illinois and Wisconsin, Kane is married to Kathleen Vinehout, a former Democratic state senator from rural Buffalo County, which borders the river north of La Crosse. Buffalo, too, switched from Democrat to Republican in 2016.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s victorious Election Day model for Wisconsin was wrong. But her mistake was widely shared. The weekend before the 2016 election, a knowledgeable pollster unaffiliated with Clinton assured me that Wisconsin would be closer than many supposed \u2014 but Democrats would prevail nonetheless.\n\nWisconsin is not a Democratic bastion, despite presidential victories that stretched from 1988 until 2016. Obama\u2019s solid wins in 2008 and 2012 were solid exceptions (and solid evidence of what an exceptional politician he was). Obama\u2019s comfortable margins in the state obscured other, perhaps more relevant, data points. In 2004, John Kerry defeated George W. Bush in Wisconsin by little more than 11,000 votes \u2013 less than four-tenths of 1%. Al Gore won the state over Bush in 2000 by fewer than 6,000 votes.\n\nBetween its warm embraces of Obama, Wisconsin elected Scott Walker, an aggressive Republican partisan, as governor in 2010, again in 2012 in a recall election and once more in 2014. After going for Trump in 2016, the state voted for liberal Democrat Tammy Baldwin, the nation\u2019s first openly gay U.S. senator, in a landslide in 2018, and also elected Democrat Tony Evers for governor over Walker by a very slim margin. Wisconsin is home to Obama-Walker-Trump-Baldwin voters, political shape-shifters who seem to defy reason as well as partisanship.\n\nAfter the 2016 debacle, Vinehout and Kane zeroed in on another species of voter who contributed to the surprise: rural white men who were not regular voters. \u201cI called up the clerks. I called up the poll workers. I wanted to know what happened,\u201d recalled Vinehout in a telephone interview. What the clerks and poll workers told her was that a number of Wisconsinites who voted in 2016 were new faces. In rural counties like Buffalo, Vinehout said, \u201cward-level data shows that a lot of people came to the polls for the first time.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats fear that Trump has the equivalent of reserve troops \u2014 non-college-educated white males who didn\u2019t vote in 2016 but who, after four years of Trump\u2019s domination of media, political culture and the very oxygen we all breathe, might turn out in 2020.\n\nYou can register and vote in Wisconsin on Election Day. In three counties in this southwest corner of the state, each of which flipped from Democrat to Republican, same-day registration jumped from 2012 to 2016 \u2014 up 22% in Vernon County, up 40% in Crawford, up 54% in Grant. \u201cThey were in their 20s, 30s and 40s, and they were farmers and they were mostly men,\u201d Vinehout said of the new voters. \u201cAnd they voted for Trump.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWisconsin is not certain to be the pivotal state in the 2020 election. American politics retains ample capacity to surprise. But it\u2019s the state most likely to put one candidate or another over the 270 threshold in the Electoral College.\n\n\u201cIf you take all the states where Trump is less popular than Wisconsin, that\u2019s not enough to win the Electoral College,\u201d said state Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler. \u201cAll the states where he\u2019s more popular than Wisconsin, not enough to win the Electoral College. So whoever wins Wisconsin essentially will be president.\u201d\n\nThere are two main analytical schools among Democrats preparing for 2020. The first interprets Trump\u2019s 2016 victory as a final, desperate lunge by white Christian conservatives seeking to retain the racial, sexual and class hierarchies of the 20th century. Pollster Stanley Greenberg is prominent in this camp, arguing that Trump\u2019s coalition is tapped out and that the erosion of his support since 2016 among educated whites and non-college-educated white women dooms him in 2020. Greenberg titled his new book, \u201cGOP RIP.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a less sanguine view of the landscape, as well. One strategist I\u2019ve spoken to in recent weeks believes that the shock of 2016 proved that political professionals simply don\u2019t have a handle on a volatile new environment, which could shift again.\n\nIn a pre-Trump, conventional political universe, the Democratic response to 2016 is both obvious and mundane: Do a little better in the right places. Given the narrow margin of the 2016 defeat \u2014 a function solely of the Electoral College since Clinton won the national popular vote by almost 3 million \u2014 there\u2019s a demographic smorgasbord of targets for Democrats in 2020. Everyone knows what they are in Wisconsin.\n\nDiminish Trump\u2019s margins in rural Wisconsin, where he ran up the score in 2016 and where the farm economy going into 2020 is far from great. Increase turnout among black voters in Milwaukee, where a sizable dip from the 2012 vote was devastating to Clinton. Push college-educated white voters in the Republican suburbs, especially the densely populated rim above Milwaukee, to act on their discomfort with Trump, preferably by voting Democratic. These voters have been slower than suburban voters in other states to leave the GOP. Rally young voters to oust a president whose policies appear designed to punish them for the rest of their lives with carbon and debt. Persuade more married white women without college educations, arguably the electoral hinge on which the fate of the nation will hang, to vote against Trump (and against their many MAGA husbands).\n\nMarginal gains among a few of these groups could turn Wisconsin blue in 2020, and make a Democrat the next president. But there are a couple of catches.\n\nFirst, what if Trump represents not a last gasp of cultural and racial revanchism but a new wave? What if the trickle of white men who voted for the first time in years in Wisconsin in 2016, despite widespread predictions that Trump\u2019s candidacy was doomed, is followed in 2020 by a wave of previously nonvoting white males who conclude that Trump\u2019s brand of tribal aggression is at last something worth voting for?\n\nThe universe of nonvoters is vast. Nationwide, 4 in 10 of those eligible did not vote in 2016. According to Brookings Institution demographer William Frey, more than 21 million nonvoters in 2016 were non-college-educated white men, Trump\u2019s base. In Wisconsin, which is 81% non-Hispanic white, 459,000 non-college-educated white men didn\u2019t vote in 2016. Trump won non-college-educated white men nationwide by an astounding 50 points. A modest rise in their turnout in key states in 2020 could swamp the Democratic nominee.\n\nPolitical campaigns are generally organized to appeal to voters, not nonvoters. Strategists know much more about the former than the latter. Low-propensity voters tend to be low-information voters with weak or nonexistent ties to political institutions and limited interest in politics. But Trump has been politicizing every corner of American life, from consumer brands to social media and even football. With politics inescapable, how many more nonvoters might join the fray?\n\nThat question leads to a second catch: In a nation in which confidence in political institutions, including political parties, is grievously injured; in which once-trusted mediating institutions, such as unions, are depleted; and in which millions of voters reject legitimate news and information sources in favor of propaganda (domestic and foreign) \u2014 how do you effectively rebut Trump\u2019s appeal to low-information voters and encourage them to embrace a Democratic alternative? Or even to accept basic facts about the contours of reality?\n\nOn the opposite side of the state from La Crosse, on the second floor of a Milwaukee church, Angela Lang supervises a team of paid canvassers seeking to put the jagged pieces of representative democracy back together.\n\nLang, 30, knocked on her first door to get out the vote for Barack Obama in 2008. Now she runs Black Leaders Organizing Communities, or BLOC, which sends canvassers into mostly poor black neighborhoods in the city to knock on thousands of doors and engage residents.\n\n\u201cWe knocked on our first door November 29th of 2017,\u201d said Lang, \u201cand essentially haven\u2019t stopped knocking since \u2014 outside of maybe a week or two here or there for the holidays or to regroup.\u201d\n\nIn a digital age, \u201cknocking on doors\u201d is perhaps the crudest means of political organizing. Conversations with two dozen Democratic activists left little doubt, however, that Democrats are measuring their preparations for 2020 in doorways as well as in dollars. The state party brags that it already has 13 organizers on the ground and has dispatched volunteers to knock on more than 200,000 Wisconsin doors \u2013 more than a year before the election.\n\nIt\u2019s not a project solely to encourage black voter turnout. On a Thursday night in Green Bay, as the Packers played the Philadelphia Eagles at nearby Lambeau Field, three dozen local Democrats, almost all of them white, attended a meeting with Wikler, the state party chair.\n\nKnocking on doors, canvassing, listening and connecting personally with voters were the primary themes of discussion, punctuated by updates on the Packers score. \u201cWe have canvassing shifts the first weekend of November,\u201d announced Mike Moran, the second vice chair of the Brown County Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go out and talk to our neighbors.\u201d\n\nSome call this \u201crelational organizing.\u201d The idea is to leverage personal networks to break through the cacophony and cynicism of contemporary politics, build trust and attach free-range citizens to both a data base and a progressive base. \"For years we've been sending strangers to knock on doors,\" said Joe Zepecki, a strategist at For Our Future, a liberal super-PAC in Wisconsin. Relational organizing, he said, is \u201ca friends-and-family approach to ground-level organizing. Those conversations are so much more impactful at turning people out to vote.\"\n\nThe goal remains the same as ever: Identify voters, win over the persuadable ones, turn them out.\n\n\u201cThe vector is low-tech, face-to-face, old school,\u201d said Matt Morrison, the executive director of Working America, a union-backed group in Washington that\u2019s dedicated to mobilizing support for progressive causes. Democratic consultant Doug Sosnik, White House political director for President Bill Clinton, said, \u201cIn an era now of alienation from institutions \u2014 nobody trusts anybody \u2014 I think peer-group conversations back and forth are by far the most persuasive.\u201d\n\nAt BLOC, canvassers are trained to listen more than talk, asking residents what their concerns are. At times, the interaction veers from outreach toward constituent service. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re connecting them, and we\u2019re teaching them how to look up their representatives,\u201d Lang said of BLOC\u2019s canvassing in poor Milwaukee neighborhoods. \u201cDo you know who your alderperson is? And they\u2019re like, \u2018Actually, no.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe political intelligence such conversations yield can be useful.\n\nMaletha Jones, a BLOC canvasser, said that when she knocked on doors in 2016, a majority of the people she talked to said they supported Trump. \u201cI guess they really didn\u2019t like Hillary because of her background,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey wanted to give Trump a try.\u201d\n\nJones said many of the black residents she spoke with in Milwaukee in 2016 had heard that Trump at one time had had a black girlfriend. Based on that, she said, many concluded he was probably not racist. Keisha Robinson, program director at BLOC, said she had personally reached the same conclusion about Trump, for the same reason.\n\nAs both the Mueller report and the Senate Intelligence Committee report on the 2016 election confirmed, black voters were targeted with propaganda from Russian agents during the presidential campaign. Much of it was dedicated to disparaging Clinton with the goal of suppressing turnout. According to both Jones and Robinson, many black voters they encountered in Milwaukee were both extremely distrustful of Clinton and favorably disposed toward Trump. \u201cSome people were actually excited at the idea of Trump,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nTwo-thirds of Wisconsin\u2019s black population resides in the city of Milwaukee. Trump ultimately received few votes from blacks in the state. But the shape of that vote was hugely significant. From 2012 to 2016, the black vote margin in Wisconsin shifted a little more than 6 points from Democrat to Republican. A vote analysis by the liberal Center for American Progress found that black turnout fell 19 points from 2012 to 2016. Clinton, the report stated, \u201cwould have emerged victorious \u2013 though just barely \u2013 if she had retained Obama\u2019s black support.\u201d\n\nWisconsin is typically a high-turnout state. It seems to be getting higher, measured by the 2018 election. Scott Walker received more votes in defeat than he received in victory four years earlier. The Democrat who beat him, Tony Evers, got almost as many votes as Clinton received for president in 2016.\n\nPresuming Trump survives his sprawling scandals and impending impeachment, he will be an even more polarizing figure in 2020 than he was in 2016. In addition, with GOP donors fully servicing his campaign, which many refused to do in 2016, he will have essentially unlimited funds. While Democrats compete for their party\u2019s presidential nomination, the Trump campaign has been spending heavily on digital advertising, identifying voters and testing messages for next year.\n\n\u201cI expect Trump to smash his turnout numbers from 2016,\u201d said Wikler, the Wisconisn Democratic chair. \u201cWe\u2019re building to make sure that his vote share is lower. But we\u2019re expecting his total number of votes to be higher.\u201d\n\nSome elements of the Democratic Party, generally on the left, have argued that its best shot is to focus on casual voters and nonvoters, who tend to be supportive of activist government. A 2018 report for the left-wing Justice Democrats urged the party to stop appealing to the \u201cmushy middle\u201d and focus instead on nonvoters and marginal voters. Those groups, the report stated, \u201chave a preference for Democrats while the most consistent voters have a preference for Republicans. Democrats will do better if they get individuals who voted in only one election (mostly 2012) to become excited and turn out.\u201d\n\nOthers are convinced that the choice between turning out the base and corralling persuadable voters is no choice at all, said Democratic pollster Paul Maslin, who is based in Madison. \u201cI have been in the camp from Day One that it\u2019s a false choice,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe have to do everything.\u201d\n\nRuy Teixeira, one of the authors of the Center for American Progress analysis, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s clear you can\u2019t put all your eggs in the \u2018Let\u2019s turn \u2019em out\u2019 basket,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cI think this is going to be a dogfight.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know if the identity of the eventual Democratic nominee will be a decisive factor in Wisconsin, or anywhere. Other, far less visible inputs, could matter more. For example, one of Walker\u2019s primary objectives in office was to damage the political power of unions in the state, undermining Democratic fundraising, organizing and performance. By all accounts he succeeded.\n\nWalker attacked unions early and often, signing Republican legislation in 2011 to limit collective-bargaining rights and in 2015 to make Wisconsin a right-to-work state. A team of scholars calculated that when a state adopts right-to-work, Democratic candidates suffer. In presidential elections, they estimated, \u201cthese laws cost Democratic candidates two to five percentage points in right-to-work counties.\u201d\n\nMajor Democratic groups are already at work in Wisconsin, preparing for 2020. The super-PAC American Bridge has announced that it plans to spend $50 million trying to shave the edge off Trump\u2019s huge winning margin among rural and small-town white voters in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. A poll memo the group released in June stated that many of these voters have \u201cconcerns about Trump\u2019s honesty and deep concerns regarding Trump\u2019s record on important issues like health care.\u201d\n\nThe group already has paid staff in Wisconsin, as does Priorities USA, another leading Democratic super-PAC. Though it used to be known for opposition research, candidate tracking and rapid response, American Bridge is now collecting personal stories about the impact of Trump policy failures.\n\nIn a kind of \u201crelational media\u201d parallel to \u201crelational organizing,\u201d the group is hunting for people who previously supported Trump but no longer do, for example, after losing the sort of factory job that Trump vowed to save. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the state lost about 5,200 manufacturing jobs between August 2018 and August 2019.\n\nAfter initially targeting Wisconsin\u2019s 23 Obama-to-Trump counties, American Bridge has expanded its target list to 30. \u201cWe want to identify potential Trump defectors who will share their stories and elevate their voices,\u201d said American Bridge spokesman Jeb Fain. \u201cFolks are a lot more likely to be responsive to a message like that from their friends and neighbors.\u201d\n\nPriorities USA plans to spend tens of millions on local research and advertising, highlighting Wisconsinites who have \u201cfelt the negative impact of living in Trump\u2019s economy.\u201d The group has so far spent about $3 million on digital ads in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAs many as three dozen other liberal and Democratic groups are expected to descend on Wisconsin in 2020, spending tens of millions in a frantic effort to enlist new voters and flip Obama-Trump voters back to the Democratic column.\n\nThe Analyst Institute, a labor-backed research organization in Washington, works with progressive groups to test political messages and means of mobilization. One project the institute has supported seems well-suited to the Democratic task of 2020, especially in Wisconsin. A pilot project in Virginia in 2017 targeted women with weak partisan ties who live outside major cities and are unmoved by political arguments typically associated with feminism.\n\nLike the canvassers for BLOC in Milwaukee, those seeking out these whiter, more suburban voters in Virginia faced a wall of indifference. \u201cThe response rate is incredibly low,\u201d said Lisa Guide, who oversaw the project for Women Effect Action Fund, which worked with the Analyst Institute. \u201cThey don\u2019t answer the phone. They don\u2019t answer the door.\u201d\n\nWhen canvassers found a woman willing to talk, they invested in a 10- to 15-minute discussion about policies that would make it easier to raise a family \u2013 paid family and medical leave; affordable, high-quality child care, good public schools, secure health care. Voters who were open to the discussion received follow-up mail about a \u201cfamily-friendly economy.\u201d\n\nPost-election research suggested that the mailings were unpersuasive. But it also concluded that the canvass itself \u2013 the personal interaction \u2013 had added to the vote margin of successful Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam, and had led some among the target group to cite \u201cfamily-friendly economy\u201d as an important election issue. A similar pilot program is scheduled to roll out in Wisconsin before the end of this year.\n\nWhite women have been souring on Trump. These include non-college-educated white women, who, according to the Pew Research Center, Trump won by 23 points in 2016. Such women are less supportive of Trump\u2019s racial aggression than white men without a college degree, and less inclined to view him as a successful steward of the economy.\n\nWhites without a college degree cast about three-fifths of the total vote in the state in 2018. If Democrats are going to prevail in Wisconsin in 2020, they will likely have to peel a sizable number of non-college-educated white women away from Trump. As Ronald Brownstein wrote in the Atlantic:\n\nIn the Rust Belt states that tipped the 2016 election to Trump \u2014 Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin \u2014 few things may matter more than whether Democrats can fan doubts about Trump that have surfaced among blue-collar white women or whether the president can rebuild his margins among them with his polarizing racial and ideological attacks.\n\nBeneath the surface of daily politics, in the back of the minds of Democratic operatives, is a nagging question: How far will Trump go this time? And will Republicans, the news media or other institutions be willing or able to constrain his behavior and that of his campaign?\n\nTrump\u2019s corruption, demagogy and foreign intrigue are simply outside the experience of modern American politics. Even American political strategists who have worked abroad in compromised democracies have no experience with authoritarian corruption in an American context. Trump\u2019s willingness to do vast damage to democratic norms and institutions adds layers of uncertainty and risk to an already unsettled landscape.\n\nHe is, of course, not the only mystery factor. Russia, which contributed to Trump\u2019s victory in 2016, has seen its efforts at election sabotage spectacularly rewarded, with Trump advancing Russian strategic aims in the Middle East and Europe while weakening U.S. alliances. Former special counsel Robert Mueller warned that Russia is actively working to repeat its 2016 success. Facebook has already cited disinformation on its platform from Russia and others. How does a political party prepare for that?\n\nEvery Democrat I listened to in recent weeks insisted that the party\u2019s donors and activists are highly motivated. \u201cThe donors are so fired up on this that I think there are going to be resources that are duplications of other efforts,\u201d said Tom Russell, a Madison-based Democratic consultant.\n\nBut motivation is only part of the equation. This election is not just another partisan contest between Democrats and Republicans, as those identities were long understood. In 2016, a remarkably small number of Americans living in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin threw the Electoral College to a man uniquely unsuited to presidential powers.\n\nIn 2020, a similarly small number could determine the fate of democracy itself. Those few voters are astonishingly powerful. We just don\u2019t know who they are. Neither do they.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Francis Wilkinson at fwilkinson1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Katy Roberts at kroberts29@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nFrancis Wilkinson writes editorials on politics and U.S. domestic policy for Bloomberg Opinion.
