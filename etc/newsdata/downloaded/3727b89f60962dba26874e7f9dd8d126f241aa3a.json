The sex scenes \"went far beyond the standards in the industry\", the women said.\n\nThose who performed were led to believe parts in Franco's films would be made available, the legal papers say.\n\n'Debunked'\n\nTither-Kaplan had previously come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against the actor/director, shortly after he won a Golden Globe Award for his film The Disaster Artist last year.\n\nWhen the allegations first surfaced, Franco said they were \"not accurate\".\n\nIn response to the new case, his lawyer Michael Plonsker said: \"This is not the first time that these claims have been made and they have already been debunked.\n\n\"We have not had an opportunity to review the ill-informed complaint in depth since it was leaked to the press before it was filed and our client has yet to even be served.\n\n\"James will not only fully defend himself, but will also seek damages from the plaintiffs and their attorneys for filing this scurrilous publicity-seeking lawsuit.\"\n\nThe two women accused Franco, his production company and his two business partners of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, fraud and other wrongdoing. They are seeking unspecified damages and for any video recordings of the sex scenes to be destroyed.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
