REUTERS/Megan Lewis/File Photo\n\n\u201cMystify: Michael Hutchence\u201d features interviews with family members, colleagues and former partners - including singer Kylie Minogue and model Helena Christensen - about the rock singer, who was found dead in a Sydney hotel room in 1997 aged 37.\n\nA coroner ruled he had committed suicide.\n\nHutchence found fame as the charismatic singer and lyricist of Australian rock band INXS, which formed in the late 1970s and is known for songs like \u201cNeed You Tonight\u201d, \u201cNever Tear Us Apart\u201d, \u201cMystify\u201d and \u201cSuicide Blonde\u201d.\n\nDirector Richard Lowenstein, who knew Hutchence on a professional and personal level, said he wanted to provide \u201ca compassionate and authentic record left behind of a very important part of the history of popular music\u201d.\n\n\u201cOther documentaries had been made, there was a drama series in Australia ... and nothing I recognised in the character even in the documentaries or the drama reminded me of anything I knew about the real person,\u201d Lowenstein told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\u201cThere should be a proper record instead of these rumours and tabloid headlines.\u201d\n\nLowenstein, who directed several of Hutchence\u2019s music videos and the singer\u2019s 1986 film \u201cDogs in Space\u201d, uses personal narratives as well as archive footage, photographs and videos to recount his childhood, band days, personal troubles and untimely death.\n\nHutchence\u2019s romances also feature, including his relationship with late British television presenter Paula Yates, with whom he had a daughter.\n\n\u201cI met a person who was completely humble and shy and just quite normal in real life but on stage would put on this rock star cloak and become this ... long-haired sex god,\u201d Lowenstein said.\n\nThe documentary, screening at the BFI London Film Festival, also focuses on a brain injury Hutchence sustained during an attack in Copenhagen.\n\nHutchence lost his sense of smell and taste, something that affected him deeply, the documentary shows, with Christensen recounting that night and its aftermath.\n\n\u201cIt really was about understanding mental health and chronicling this story that just because someone\u2019s rich and famous it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve got it all sorted and everything\u2019s going to fine. There\u2019s troubles along the way,\u201d Lowenstein said.\n\nLowenstein said he had shown the film to Hutchence\u2019s daughter, Tiger Lily, who he said \u201cseemed to like it\u201d.", "description": "A new documentary seeks to move away from \"rumours and tabloid headlines\" to paint an intimate portrait of late INXS frontman Michael Hutchence, charting his rise to global stardom and personal troubles.", "authors": ["Lisa Keddie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437074309&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9317E", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
