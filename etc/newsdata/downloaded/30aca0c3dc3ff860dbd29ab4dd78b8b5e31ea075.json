Michel Spingler/Pool via REUTERS/Files\n\nModi will be speaking at the investment summit organized by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund. The event is popularly known as Davos of the Deserts.\n\n\u201cWe are well on our way to transforming the buyer-seller relation in this sector to a larger strategic partnership,\u201d said T.S. Tirumurti, a top official who handles economic relations at India\u2019s foreign ministry.\n\nIndia, which imports more than 80% of its oil needs, is keen to strengthen its relations with Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, from just being an oil buyer.\n\nIndia, the world\u2019s third-biggest oil consumer, is a key client of Saudi Arabia. In September, Saudi Arabia emerged as top oil supplier to Indian after a gap of over a year, data obtained for shipping and industry showed.\n\n\u201cWe have also invited the Saudi side to participate in India\u2019s strategic (oil) storage and we hope to finalize an MOU during this visit\u201d of the prime minister, said Tirumurti.\n\nSeparately another official said that ISPRL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of India\u2019s Oil Industry Development Board, will sign an agreement with Saudi Aramco to lease part of the 2.5 million-tonne Padur storage, in southern Karnataka state.\n\nIndia has built underground emergency storage in three places to protect itself from any disruption.\n\nSo far, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) is the only foreign company that is storing oil in India\u2019s strategic reserve at Mangalore in southern Karnataka state. Last year it signed a preliminary agreement to use half of the Padur strategic reserve.\n\nGlobal oil producers, seeking a stable outlet for their output, are also eager to gain a foothold in India, where fuel demand would continue to rise in years to come.\n\nSaudi Aramco along with ADNOC has signed a preliminary deal with Indian state run companies for a 50% stake in the planned 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) mega refinery on the country\u2019s west coast.\n\nAramco is also eyeing a 20% stake in the petrochemical and refining business of Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) in a multibillion-dollar deal.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a visit to New Delhi in February said the kingdom sees investment opportunities worth more than $100 billion in India over the next two years.\n\n\u201cOur collaboration with Saudi Arabia in the energy front has been intensified further and the two sides are set to finalize and move ahead on the west coast refinery,\u201d Tirumurti said without elaborating if a final agreement would be signed during Modi\u2019s visit.\n\nThe Middle East unit of India\u2019s top refiner and fuel retailer, Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS), will sign a preliminary deal with Saudi Arabia\u2019s\u2019 Al Jeri company for cooperation in the downstream sector, including setting up fuel stations in the kingdom, he said.\n\n(This story corrects day Thursday from Wednesday in paragraph 1)", "description": "India hopes to sign energy deals with Saudi Arabia that include its participation in India's strategic petroleum reserve, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the kingdom next week, a government official said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Nidhi Verma", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444501826&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N159", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
