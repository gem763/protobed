Fossil animal droppings, charcoal from ancient fires and bone fragments litter the ground at the site\n\nFossil animal droppings, charcoal from ancient fires and bone fragments litter the ground at the site, which provided the first ever physical evidence of Denisovans.\n\nThe latest evidence from southern Siberia in Russia shows that large cave-dwelling beasts competed with ancient tribes for prime space in cave shelters.\n\nProfessor Roberts, of the University of Wollongong, said: 'Using microscopic analyses, our latest study shows sporadic hominin visits, illustrated by traces of the use of fire such as miniscule fragments, but with continuous use of the site by cave-dwelling carnivores such as hyaenas and wolves.\n\nProfiles of sediment showing a Denisova fossil poo gallery, including hyena, wolf and others. this, the researchers say, is evidence the humans were regularly uprooted by the animals wanting to use the cave\n\nStudies of the famed Denisova cave (pictured) in Siberia has revealed Homo sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans all inhabited the cave at some point\n\n'Fossil droppings indicate the persistent presence of non-human cave dwellers, which are very unlikely to have co-habited with humans using the cave for shelter.'\n\nHe said that implies that ancient groups probably came and went for short-lived episodes, and at all other times the cave was occupied by these large predators.\n\nA team of Russian and Australian scientists have used state of the art geo-archaeological techniques to unearth new details of day-to-day life in the Denisova Cave complex hidden in its dirt.\n\nLarge carnivores and the early humans used the site for thousands of years.\n\nStudy lead author Dr Mike Morley, of Flinders University in Australia, said: 'These hominin groups and large carnivores such as hyenas and wolves left a wealth of microscopic traces that illuminate the use of the cave over the last three glacial-interglacial cycles.\n\nMicroscopic studies of sediment left in the cave includes fossil droppings left by predatory animals such as hyenas and wolves (pictured)\n\nThe Siberian site first came to prominence more than a decade ago with the discovery of the fossil remains of a previously unknown human group, dubbed the Denisovans(pictured, artist's impression) after the local name for the cave\n\n'Our results complement previous work by some of our colleagues at the site that has identified ancient DNA in the same dirt, belonging to Neanderthals and a previously unknown human group, the Denisovans, as well as a wide range of other animals.'\n\nBut it now seems that it was the animals that mostly ruled the cave space back then.\n\nMicroscopic studies of 13 feet of sediment in the cave network revealed fossil droppings left by predatory animals.\n\nThis corroborates cave paintings around ancient Eurasia showing what are thought to be prehistoric animals which likely preyed on humans.\n\nFrom their 'micromorphology' examination of the dirt found in Denisova Cave, the team discovered clues about the use of the cave, including fire-use by ancient humans and the presence of other animals.\n\nThe Siberian site first came to prominence more than a decade ago with the discovery of the fossil remains of a previously unknown human group, dubbed the Denisovans after the local name for the cave.\n\nIn a surprising twist, the recent discovery of a bone fragment in the cave sediments showed that a teenage girl was born of a Neanderthal mother and Denisovan father more than 90,000 years ago.\n\nDenisovans and Neanderthals inhabited parts of Eurasia until 40,000 or 50,000 years ago, when they were replaced by modern humans.\n\nThe findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\nStudy lead author Dr Mike Morley (pictured) of Flinders University in Australia, said that large humans and prehistoric carnivores fought over the cave for thousands of years", "description": "Studies of the famed Denisova cave in Siberia has revealed Homo sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans all inhabited the cave at some point.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/11/18958158-0-image-a-17_1569492606483.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
