I think we're playing some good footy and this is another chance for guys, who didn't play in the last game, to do the same.\n\nI know different teams have different strategies on how they want to approach it. Some want to go with the same players all the time, maybe rest out (players for easier games).\n\nOn Matt Toomua starting at fly-half:\n\nI don't think Christian's [Lealiifano] done anything particularly deserving of saying 'no you're not going to play'. We're just taking a look and understand that in tournament play you have the opportunity to change the picture a little bit.\n\nThis is how we think this squad [works] best, to keep giving opportunity to guys, keeping the contest alive, so if we do the right thing and get through to knockout stages, we know everyone has been doing their bit and we've got multiple options in different positions.\n\nWe don't know what's going to happen with anything along the way, with injury, suspension. We feel like we're pretty clear with how we're operating and it's up to players then, on the field, to own that and say 'you've got to pick me because I'm playing so good'.", "description": "What is it?", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Paul Hayward", "Mick Cleary"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000212042227-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
