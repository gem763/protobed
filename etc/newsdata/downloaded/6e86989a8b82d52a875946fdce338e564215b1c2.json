The senator could have begun by acknowledging that the DOJ report was correct and that she was mistaken in calling Brown\u2019s death a murder. Then she could have proceeded to the rest of the story: that the Ferguson police had a pattern of \u201cunlawful bias\u201d against blacks\u2014documented by the Justice Department in a separate report issued on the same day the department cleared Wilson\u2014and that a number of cases, including the deaths of Scott, Garner, and McDonald, underscored the persistent problem of police violence against black men.\n\nInstead, Warren conceded nothing. \u201cWhat matters,\u201d she told Haslett, \u201cis that a man was shot, an unarmed man, in the middle of the street by police officers and left to die. And I think that\u2019s where our focus should be.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s answer compounded her initial falsehood by adding a second myth. As awful as it was that Brown\u2019s body lay in the street for four hours\u2014an affront that even Ferguson\u2019s police chief acknowledged and regretted\u2014it isn\u2019t true that Brown was left to die. (According to the DOJ report on Brown\u2019s death, Wilson\u2019s final shot killed him \u201cwhere he stood.\u201d) But what\u2019s most concerning is Warren\u2019s failure to admit error, particularly when the error is an accusation of murder. Does she respect facts that don\u2019t fit her narrative? If she becomes the Democratic nominee, will voters see her as a truth teller in the face of Donald Trump\u2019s lies, or as an ideologue? If she becomes president, will she listen to information that complicates her plans? Or will she plow ahead?\n\nCandidates should talk about police bias. They should honor the memory of those whose lives have been taken. There\u2019s no need to rely on a false narrative to tell the truth that black lives matter.", "description": "", "authors": ["William Saletan", "Slate.Com News-And-Politics Warren-Michael-Brown-Ferguson-Misrepresenting-Death.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
