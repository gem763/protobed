The subpoena indicates that police are investigating potential child sex abuse but provides no details of the alleged encounter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe subpoena, signed by a Superior Court judge, also asks for Bransfield\u2019s personnel file and for records related to his travel around the time of the pilgrimage.\n\nThe criminal investigation adds new gravity to a scandal that has roiled the Catholic Church in recent months.\n\nBransfield was a bishop with strong ties to Catholic leaders in the United States and the Vatican before he was ousted last September over allegations that he sexually harassed and touched young priests and spent millions of dollars in church money to maintain an extravagant lifestyle. Bransfield has denied those allegations.\n\nOn Thursday, he also denied the sexual abuse allegation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOh my God. Oh no, that\u2019s horrible,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cThat did not happen. Somebody has imagined this. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting attacked from people I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nLisa Manning, an attorney for Bransfield, said: \u201cThe allegations against him are not true. Bishop Bransfield has full faith that the investigation will conclude that the claim against him is unfounded.\u201d\n\nA lawyer representing the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston said it was cooperating. \u201cThe Diocese was made aware of a complaint against former Bishop Bransfield of an incident alleged to have occurred in Washington, D.C. some years ago, involving a minor and it promptly reported the matter to the appropriate civil authorities in Washington, D.C.,\u201d James C. Gardill said in a statement. \u201cAs is the Diocese\u2019s policy, it has deferred to such authorities to pursue their investigation before invoking its own process. The Diocese is cooperating with the investigation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAsked about the investigation of Bransfield\u2019s actions during the National Shrine trip, D.C. police spokeswoman Kristen Metzger said, \u201cAt this time the case is still under active investigation and we don\u2019t have any further details to release.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn June, The Post reported that a confidential investigation commissioned by the Vatican found that Bransfield engaged in years of predatory behavior with young seminarians and priests. A report of the investigation\u2019s findings, which church officials have not released, expressed concern that Bransfield might also have behaved improperly with children.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe did not find conclusive evidence that Bishop Bransfield committed sexual misconduct with minors; however, there is significant reason for concern that this occurred,\u201d the report stated, citing \u201cseveral troubling incidents\u201d involving altar servers.\n\nAD\n\nA lay assistant to Bransfield told investigators that he had recommended that church officials warn parents not to allow their children to serve as altar servers, the report said. A top aide, Monsignor Kevin Quirk, told investigators that Bransfield \u201cdid not want female servers assisting him,\u201d according to the report.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nBransfield allegedly exposed his erect penis to a young man who was about to enter the seminary, the young man told lay investigators. Assistants to Bransfield told the investigators that he also touched them in inappropriate ways and sometimes kissed them on the mouth or neck, the report says.\n\nTwo former seminarians have sued the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston, claiming they were harassed by Bransfield.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nIn 2018, Quirk wrote in a letter to Baltimore Archbishop William Lori that Bransfield\u2019s \u201cinappropriate touches\u201d had become \u201ccommonplace,\u201d according to a letter obtained by The Post.\n\nQuirk wrote that Bransfield often caressed the faces of young seminarians or priests as they received Communion.\n\n\u201cThis action is so remarkable and disturbing that priests usually remark upon it among themselves and I personally have found it unsettling each time I have seen it,\u201d Quirk wrote.\n\nAD\n\nBransfield has denied misconduct, telling The Post in June that people were trying to destroy his reputation. \u201cNone of it is true,\u201d he said about the investigative report.\n\nBransfield faced a public allegation of abuse during his tenure in West Virginia. He vehemently denied ever abusing anyone, and nothing came of the case.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2007, a student at a Catholic high school near Philadelphia where Bransfield taught in the 1970s accused the cleric of fondling him. At the time, church officials said the claim was not credible.\n\nDuring his tenure in West Virginia, Bransfield regularly called on the state\u2019s parishioners to travel on a pilgrimage to worship at the National Shrine, where he formerly served as rector and finance director.\n\nDuring the September 2012 trip, organizers arranged bus rides for parishioners who paid $30. Bransfield did not ride on the buses. Instead, as he did in at least one other instance, he charted a private jet and took a limousine from Dulles International Airport to the shrine, according to internal church records obtained by The Post.\n\nAD", "description": "A subpoena delivered to church officials this week seeks any abuse complaints against Bransfield as well as documents related to a 2012 pilgrimage to the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in D.C.", "authors": ["Shawn Boburg", "Investigative Reporter", "Robert O'Harrow Jr.", "Investigative Reporter Covering The Trump Administration", "Technology"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BZFBNcyBb9mmoOn-1ZkOVc5RScQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HPMZJUXGDMI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg"}
