Its employees were informed of the decision on Friday. The company continues to struggle, as consumers increasingly shop online without going into traditional brick-and-mortar department stores.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nMacy's has had its name on the Seattle store -- which takes up an entire city block and is located at 300 Pine Street -- since 2003.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % M MACY'S INC. 15.29 +0.04 +0.26%\n\n\u201cAfter careful consideration, Macy\u2019s, Inc. has decided to sell the Downtown Seattle Macy\u2019s building,\u201d Blair Rosenberg, director of corporate communications for Macy's, told the Seattle Times. \u201cThe decision to close a store is always difficult, and we look forward to continuing to serve our customers at nearby Macy\u2019s Bellevue Square, Alderwood, Southcenter, and the Redmond Furniture Gallery, and online at macys.com.\u201d\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % AMZN AMAZON.COM INC. 1,725.45 -14.39 -0.83%\n\nStarwood Capital Group bought four floors in the eight-story building for $65 million in 2015 and added two other floors in 2017, leaving Macy's the two bottom floors and the basement. Two years ago, Amazon said it was leasing the top six floors of the building. The leased space is enough to hold about 1,500 employees. Macy's still has a presence in a south Seattle mall and malls in surrounding suburbs.\n\nThe disclosure was followed by another retail bankruptcy, Forever 21 which announced plans late Sunday to file Chapter 11 capping a long list of retailers that have made that choice, along with those closing stores.\n\nSeveral Macy's shoppers spoke with The Seattle Times about their feelings on the store's imminent closing: \"I come in (to Macy\u2019s) when I get prompted, like when there\u2019s a gift with purchasing makeup,\u201d Laura Heydrich said. \u201cThe homeless people outside deter you from coming in. I feel safer at home (shopping online).\u201d May Gerstle added: \u201cThey\u2019re being put out of business by Amazon. It\u2019s sad. Too bad.\u201d\n\nThe company said that, despite the bad news, it still intends to go forward its traditional Macy's Holiday Parade and fireworks show in Seattle on Nov. 29 for the twenty-ninth year.\n\nA Macy's spokesperson was not immediately available to comment on this report.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Macy's is closing one of its landmark stores in the Northwest.", "authors": ["Christian De La Chapelle"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/2017-06-06t170840z_1_lynxmped551jm_rtroptp_3_macys-results.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
