Intense competition continues to grip mattress industry", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Here are five ways to tell that you need a new mattress ASAP. Melissa Rorech, Reviewed\n\nFor the last few years, the mattress industry has been rocked by overexpansion, bankruptcies and digital threats.\n\nNow, as those competitive forces continue, some of the industry's biggest players are trying to stand out with the ultimate promotion: cheap, long-term financing deals. In some cases, these offers are more akin to financing a car than a mattress \u2013 up to six years with 0% interest, for example. And while zero percent interest loans can cut into profits, they serve to juice sales.\n\nThese promotions are the soft sell behind the softest of purchases. But if the customer doesn't pay on time, the rate typically spikes well into the double digits.\n\nA six-year loan to buy a mattress is longer than the average new-car loan, which was 69.7 months in September, according to car-research site Edmunds.\n\nMattress industry executives say they're not extending loans to borrowers who can't pay, so there's no reason to be concerned. But the strategy bears resemblance to how the automotive industry got overextended in the lead-up to the 2008-09 financial crisis, dishing out loans to keep sales humming until the industry collapsed under the weight of unsustainable practices.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"Things are getting so competitive in terms of pricing and promotion, it\u2019s about what else you can you offer?\" said Mike Akrop, chief financial officer of mattress start-up Leesa, which limits its loans to 36 months, sells mattresses online and sells in stores such as Macy's and Hudson's Bay.\n\nAt Mattress Firm, which remains the nation's leading retailer despite closing about 700 stores during its recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy, financing offers abound.\n\nThere's a fierce battle over your bed: Industry goes to the mattresses\n\nChapter 11: Mattress Firm files for bankruptcy protection\n\nThe company is currently offering what it calls \"special financing\" of 0% interest for up to six years on purchases of at least $3,999. The offer also extends to shorter-term 0% options, such as four years with a minimum purchase of $1,999 and three years with a minimum purchase of $1,299.\n\nMattress Firm did not respond to questions in time for this story.\n\nScott Thompson, CEO of Tempur Sealy, which sells the Tempur-Pedic and Sealy brands, estimated that up to 30% of high-end mattresses are purchased with financing. Mattress prices typically range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.\n\nCLOSE You probably didn't know you could clean your mattress. Well you can and you should! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to clean your bed! Melissa Rorech, Reviewed\n\nAt Tempur Sealy, offers for qualified customers include 0% interest for five years on $8,000 purchases, three years on $2,000 purchases and two years on $1,500 purchases. Tempur Sealy sells mattresses at Mattress Firm, other retailers, its own stores and online.\n\n\"Retailers have learned over time they need a call to action in their promotion to drive sales,\" Thompson said.\n\nAt Tempur Sealy rival Serta Simmons, qualified customers can get five-year loans at 0% interest on purchases of at least $3,000. Other offers include 0% for four years on purchases of at least $2,000 and three years on buys of at least $1,299.\n\nThompson rejected the suggestion that mattress companies are dabbling in the type of financing that got the car industry into trouble.\n\nTempur Sealy International recently introduced a new bed-in-a-box mattress called the Tempur Cloud. (Photo: Tempur Sealy International)\n\nHe said he did not believe the financing environment had entered an unsustainable phase like when the car industry doled out loans to subprime buyers, whose finances aren't as strong and are considered a greater risk to fail to pay when times get tough.\n\n\"This is not subprime,\" he said. \"It's quite frankly a great deal for the customer. The product doesn't go up in price. They just get free financing over the long term.\"\n\nJerry Epperson, a mattress industry veteran and managing director of investment banking and corporate advisory firm Mann, Armistead & Epperson, said more than half of all mattresses are purchased with credit.\n\n\"Traditional credit suppliers\" like Synchrony and Wells Fargo \"have been supplemented by a lot of private equity-backed consumer credit organizations\" that are now extending mattress loans, Epperson said. He estimated \"there are probably 25 of them now working with retailers in the furniture industry.\"\n\nEpperson said loans have gotten longer in recent years as competition intensified and mattresses got better. New technologies such as \"hybrid\" mattresses, which typically combine coils and foam, have caused some prices to reach into the several thousands.\n\nAlthough promotional interest rates are often 0%, they often bump up to 17% to 22% when the customer fails to pay on time, said Epperson, who has studied the industry for the International Sleep Products Association.\n\nTo keep sales humming, mattress retailers are tweaking loan offers to help customers achieve a specific monthly payment that works with their budget, he said.\n\nNeed a lower payment? Spread the loan out longer. Bigger payment affordable? Take out a shorter-term loan.\n\nAs a result, \"people are moving up in price points, moving up in quality,\" Epperson said.\n\nMeanwhile, the online startups that dominate the bed-in-a-box business have been \"slower to offer the options that the brick-and-mortar stores offer,\" Epperson said.\n\nLeesa, for example, currently extends loans up to 18 months at 0% interest. The company's longest financing offers go up to three years, and the company is unlikely to offer anything beyond four years, Akrop said.\n\n\"We want to balance that with creditworthiness,\" he said.\n\nCasper, which is often credited as the industry's leader in online bed-in-a-box sales, is also only offering 0% interest for up to 18 months.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/25/mattress-loans-mattress-financing-offers/4054792002/", "description": "As feverish competition continues to grip the mattress business, some of the industry's biggest players are now offering\u00a0cheap long-term loan deals.", "authors": ["Nathan Bomey", "Published A.M.
