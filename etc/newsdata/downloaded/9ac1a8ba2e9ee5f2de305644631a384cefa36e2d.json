Thomas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter a temporary hiccup, Iowa Democrats are back on track with a proposal to make their presidential caucuses comply with the national party\u2019s requirements to provide more accessibility to voters who struggle to attend the traditional multi-hour fixed-time-and-location events. A \u201csatellite caucuses\u201d add-on has been unanimously approved by the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Rules and Bylaws panel, which a few weeks ago killed plans from Iowa and Nevada to hold a \u201cvirtual caucus\u201d by phone.\n\nVirtual causes were ruled out because of fears about such a system\u2019s clear vulnerability to hacking. Other options Iowa Democrats considered (e.g., mail-in ballots or in-person early voting) would have taken the caucuses too far in the direction of primaries, which might have triggered New Hampshire\u2019s law requiring it to hold the first primary in the nation. Iowa and Nevada could simply have asked for, and probably have secured, a waiver for 2020 letting them go ahead with their past practices. But for Iowans paranoid about losing their first spot in the line of nominating contests, acknowledging an inability to make the caucuses more accessible seemed to give too much ammunition to those who want to blow up the whole calendar with its privileged early states (in order, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina).\n\nThe \u201csatellite caucuses\u201d approach is the \u201caccessibility reform\u201d that would least disrupt the traditional system. Here\u2019s how the Iowa Democratic Party describes it:\n\n\u2022 The 2020 satellite caucus proposal will allow for additional caucus locations on February 3 to expand participation for people who cannot attend their in-person precinct caucus \u2026 \u2022 Iowa Democrats can apply to hold a satellite site at places like factories, group homes, or community gathering places, to better accommodate people who cannot attend their in-person caucus. This option will be especially useful for shift workers, Iowans with disabilities, Iowans serving overseas, and students. \u2022 The IDP will create a special satellite-caucus review committee that will review applications and determine approval \u2026 \u2022 The results will be reported using the same method as precinct caucus locations. The satellite caucuses will create one additional county in each congressional district.\n\nThese satellite events will be live, not virtual, and will have to take place on the same day as the regular caucuses, February 3, though some provision will be made for variations in the exact starting times. Although giving virtual caucuses (depending on participation) ten percent of the state-delegate-equivalents awards, by which victory in the Iowa Caucuses is measured, had been contemplated, the satellite system will probably be less significant in affecting the outcome. What it most seems to resemble is the system already employed by Nevada in 2016 to accommodate casino and hotel workers who were on duty when the regular caucuses were held:\n\nThe Nevada Democratic Party set up six caucus locations on the Las Vegas strip to accommodate shift workers at the hotels and casinos so they don\u2019t have to travel to their home precincts to participate.\n\nPresumably, national party approval of Iowa\u2019s satellite-caucus proposal will make it easy for Nevada to reuse or expand its own 2016 system.\n\nAs for Iowa, the satellite caucuses will create an interesting organizational challenge for the various presidential campaigns \u2014 and for pollsters and journalists, too. Participation in the new Ann Selzer poll of Iowa, which is creating a buzz in political circles because it shows Elizabeth Warren in the lead, did not mention any options beyond the traditional caucuses (a June Selzer poll had been based on the availability of virtual caucuses \u201cto take place online or by phone on several days leading up to the traditional, in-person caucus meetings on February 3\u201d). It\u2019s possible that Selzer\u2019s sample had been too large in June and too small in September; that\u2019s entirely unclear. But at least now everyone can get onto the same page between now and November.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
