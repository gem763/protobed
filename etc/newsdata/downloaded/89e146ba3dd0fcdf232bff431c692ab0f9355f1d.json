(Spoiler: They\u2019re not.)\n\nIn order to provide evidence of insider trading, you need two key ingredients. You need to show that someone made a profit and you need to show that they had inside information. In this case, Cohan provides neither. He\u2019s basically p-hacking: He\u2019s saying that if the people doing these trades had been insider trading, then they would have been insider trading. Which doesn\u2019t really get us very far.\n\nCohan also tends to ignore the more obvious explanations for what is going on. The biggest trade he talks about took place \u201cin the last 30 minutes of trading on June 28\u201d\u2014which also happens to be the very end of the second quarter. Big trades always happen at the very end of the quarter; it would be more surprising if there wasn\u2019t a big trade around then.", "description": "", "authors": ["Felix Salmon", "Slate.Com Business Vanity-Fairs-Trump-Chaos-Trades-Story-Is-A-Fantasy.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
