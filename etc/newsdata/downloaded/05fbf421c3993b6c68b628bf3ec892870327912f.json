The couple spends about $165 a month on food, and use every penny to create colorful, pre-packaged meals.\n\nClark spends six hours every Sunday cooking a week's worth of meals and makes sure every breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack contains 400 calories.\n\nTheir diet even includes \u201cfakeaway\u201d (fake take-away) style foods like juicy burgers, spicy curries, big steaks and even chocolate donuts.\n\nFIELD TRIP TO MCDONALD'S? THIRD-GRADERS DITCH RECESS, HEAD TO FAST-FOOD JOINT OVER MILE AWAY FROM SCHOOL\n\nThe creative couple change their menu every week, and signature dishes include beef meatballs, veggie kebabs and chicken pizza. They also like Italian sausage and chickpea casserole, buffalo chicken-stuffed sweet potato skins with cheese, and double-chocolate protein donuts.\n\nProud of their colorful cooking, the couple shares their meal preps online, where they have thousands of followers.\n\nClark, a truck driver from Greater Manchester, England, who now weighs 187 pounds, said: \u201cWe make absolutely everything from scratch and we eat whatever we want. It\u2019s not a diet. I love what I eat and enjoy every mouthful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can be hard work. I do it on a Sunday and spend hours doing it. But I don\u2019t cook in the week at all. It\u2019s all done in one go,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s all about making sure your diet is balanced and sustainable. I cook really tasty food, even things that people usually think are unhealthy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a diet plan that allows you to eat whatever you want. What I cook are really nice meals. I\u2019d say it\u2019s the best diet in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nDeniz, who now weighs 136 pounds, added: \"The way we eat is amazing. It's a way of life that I couldn't live without now.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\"I used to eat food for convenience without realizing how bad it was for me. I started skipping meals as I thought that was the only way to lose weight,\u201d she said. \"I love our diet. We eat naughty foods too but it's all about moderation and balance.\"\n\nClark was the first to start meal prepping, and used it as a way to lose weight before he met Deniz.\n\nHe weighed 300 pounds thanks to a diet of burgers, sausage sandwiches and pub lunches he ate due to his truck-driving job 16 years ago. He would gorge on between 4,000 and 5,000 calories a day and was known to his friends as \u201cFat John.\u201d\n\nClark, then age 23, booked an appointment with his doctor when he started to struggle to buy clothes, and was told he was obese.\n\n\u201cI sat in my car outside desperate, alone and cried,\" he said. \u201cI was given some leaflets on what I should and shouldn\u2019t eat but I wasn\u2019t offered much help at all. I didn\u2019t know where to start. I found it really difficult.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nHe started working out up to five times a week and lost lots of weight \u2014 but hated the early daily workouts, so took up extreme meal prepping in 2004 after wanting to make a change.\n\nThe pounds \u201cjust dropped off\u201d and his weight plummeted to 178 in 2008, when he was in his best shape, after four years of preparing all his meals every Sunday.\n\nHe did this alone and in relative secret for years until he met his partner Deniz in 2017.\n\nShe weighed around 224 pounds, and while Clark loved her the way she was, she suffered from low confidence and self-esteem. She said she \"hated\" the way she looked.\n\nIn her 20s, the woman says she had an \"awful diet\" and didn't exercise, causing her to pile on the pounds. She recalls how she used to view food as her enemy and restrict herself to only one meal a day in desperation to lose weight.\n\nA regular day for her would see her gorge on junk food, like takeout, chips and burgers or pizzas, in one binge-eating sitting each day. But after meeting Clark she started to embrace his diet and in just a year dropped to 136 pounds, going from a size 18 to a size 8.\n\nDeniz, who only signed up to the gym after reaching her target weight, said: \"I wasn't eating right at all. It was unhealthy.\u201d\n\n\"John had gone through the same and related to what I was going through. I was determined to lose weight but I just didn't know how,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe was my coach. He still inspires me to this day.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor years, Clark prepped his own meals at home every Sunday, cooking more regular meals, but began experimenting with food to make dieting fun for Deniz. The two are now masters of eating well on a shoestring budget.\n\nHere's how it works: The couple bulk-buys all of their food for the next week on a Friday. They spend around $100 on 11 pounds of chicken, burgers, sausages, ground meat and fish online, $30 on fruit and vegetables at their local market, and get everything else from Aldi and Tesco. Clark then tires away in the kitchen on a Sunday, cooking up four meals per day for the next seven days, both for himself and accounts manager Deniz.\n\nThey then put it all in 56 individual containers, and share the ideas on Instagram under the name @themealprepking.\n\n\u201cI make a huge variety,\" Clark, a dad of two, said. \"I\u2019ve even done vegetarian and gluten-free meals at the requests of followers.\n\n\u201cWe have a very varied diet and the food we eat is amazing. Some people literally don\u2019t believe it when they see,\" he said. \u201cUnlike some diets these meals aren\u2019t grey and boring. It\u2019s all fun food and is all about moderation and variety.\"\n\nClark added that he \"wouldn\u2019t give it up for the world.\"\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to think of myself as having a diet plan. I eat what I want,\u201d he claimed. \u201cNow I just want to help other people too.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally published by SWNS.", "description": "Meet the meal-prep king and queen who have lost a combined 200 pounds by cooking the entire weeks' food in one go.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/meal-prep-king-queen-SWNS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
