The upcoming unveiling of virtual banking licences will bring even more opportunities for fintech startups and traditional banks to partner and cooperate.\"\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) chief fintech officer Sopnendu Mohanty said: \"Crossing a billion-Singapore-dollar investment threshold is recognition from investors around the world of the potential of Singapore\u2019s fintech ecosystem and the outlook for digital financial services not just in Singapore, but also in South-east Asia.\n\n\"It\u2019s encouraging to see the local startups financing their global growth from Singapore. Additionally, several global fintech companies with regional headquarters in Singapore have recently raised sizeable funds to fuel their Asian expansion.\"\n\nFor the report, Accenture Research worked with MAS to analyse fintech investment data from global venture-finance data and analytics providers CB Insights, Pitchbook and Tracxn.\n\nThe analysis included financing activity from venture capital and private equity firms, corporations and corporate venture capital divisions, hedge funds, accelerators and government-backed funds.\n\nThe investment data ranged from 2015 through the first nine months of 2019 and included equity and non-equity financing.\n\nA previous report by Accenture, which analysed data from CB Insights, showed fintech investments in Singapore nearly quadrupled to US$453 million in the first half of 2019, up from US$118 million in the year-ago period.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - FINTECH investments in Singapore for the nine months ended Sept 30 jumped 69 per cent to US$735 million from US$435 million in the same year-ago period, according to research from professional services firm Accenture. .
