The Angels\u2019 opening was filled when they announced the hiring of Joe Maddon on Wednesday. The Padres have been connected to a small handful of candidates, based on multiple reports, including Henley, interim manager Rod Barajas, Braves third base coach Ron Washington and former Angels manager Brad Ausmus, The Mets are expected to cast a wide net and go after a number of high-profile options. Those already include former Yankees manager Joe Girardi, Carlos Beltran and Eduardo Perez.\n\nHenley was already with the franchise when the Nationals moved from Montreal to Washington. He served in a number of minor-league roles in the 2000s, including six years as a manager and four more as a field coordinator. He was then named Nationals\u2019 third-base coach in 2014 and has held the job since. He also works with Washington\u2019s outfielders.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBogar joined the Nationals when Manager Dave Martinez pieced together his staff before the 2018 season. The two first connected with the Tampa Bay Rays and became close friends. He was one of Martinez\u2019s first calls when he was hired by the Nationals, and is a close confidant. Bogar served 22 games as the Texas Rangers\u2019 interim manager in 2014. He had a 14-8 record and, aside from that, has worked for the Rays, Boston Red Sox, Mariners and Nationals since 2008. He played for nine major league seasons and was a utility infielder with three clubs. He is now the Nationals\u2019 infield coach and is in charge of defensive alignments and base-running.\n\nNationals bench coach Chip Hale interviewed for the Baltimore Orioles\u2019 opening last winter. He did not get the job \u2014 Baltimore eventually went with Brandon Hyde \u2014 and Martinez\u2019s coaches all returned for a second season. There was a shake-up when pitching coach Derek Lilliquist was fired in late April, leading to the promotion of Paul Menhart, but Martinez has otherwise pointed to staff continuity as important to his team\u2019s success. But a World Series run is always bound to create interest for the coaches who helped make it possible.\n\nBarry Svrluga contributed to this report.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "Bob Henley recently interviewed for the San Diego Padres' managerial opening.
