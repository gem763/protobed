After that, the latest US jobs report will be released on Friday which also usually typically triggers volatility.\n\nBut ahead of that, there is some risk arising from Brexit developments that should not be ignored.\n\nYesterday, UK PM Johnson failed in an attempt to call for an election, but he will try again today.\n\nThe main difference is that he needed two-thirds of the parliament to agree to yesterday\u2019s vote where a simple majority will do today.\n\nThe opposition said they will support a new election although they have a few stipulations. The key one being that Johnson won\u2019t push to ratify the Brexit deal on the table ahead of the elections. Further, they need some reassurance that this does not put a no-deal Brexit back on the table.\n\nAlthough EUR/USD has been rising as of late on a few different drivers, I think the pair is at risk if the UK parliament decides to have an election. After all, Sterling is up nearly 5% month to date on Brexit optimism which has also kept the euro underpinned. A delay in ratifying the current Brexit deal stands to remove a lot of this optimism from the markets.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nA fairly well respected horizontal level is in play in the early week at 1.1072. The significance of it is best seen on a daily chart where it held EUR/USD higher for most of August and lower in September.\n\n[fx-image src=/2019/10/EURUSD-Daily-Chart-13.png originalWidth=916 ratio=2.4 data-zoom-target=https://responsive.fxempire.com/cdn/n/n/_fxempire_/2019/10/EURUSD-Daily-Chart-13.png]\n\nI suspect a break of this level could trigger a test of the 50-day moving average which currently falls just below 1.1050.\n\n[fx-image src=/2019/10/EURUSD-4-Hour-Chart-14.png originalWidth=916 ratio=2.13 data-zoom-target=https://responsive.fxempire.com/cdn/n/n/_fxempire_/2019/10/EURUSD-4-Hour-Chart-14.png]\n\nTo the upside, the 1.11 handle proved to be a hurdle yesterday. I expect that it will continue to do so. On a 4-hour chart, this level had a confluence of resistance yesterday as a recently broken rising trendline fell near the level.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe recovery in EUR/USD was short-lived, the pair appears to be making another run at support.\n\nVolatility is likely to increase late in the week as the Fed meets and the US jobs report is due. In the meantime, further political developments in the UK stand to move the pair.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "EUR/USD bounced from an important support level on Monday but is struggling to hold on to the gain.", "authors": ["Jignesh Davda"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XxWmvjEBJDxwQNsMukwrug--~B/aD00MTA7dz02MTU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/28fdc0b66ae68c16234e16b1898579a3", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
