Even a passing familiarity with the history of the 20th century would convince you that the opposite is true.\n\nNavarro knows the history, she\u2019s just pushing an agenda. Watch this 90-second display, one of the most embarrassing in the history of this frequently embarrassing show. The dumbest moment is when she appears to conclude that Rand Paul, libertarian, is *defending Maduro* and denying that he\u2019s a thug.\n\nObviously, when Paul says \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he\u2019s not denying that Maduro is an autocrat. He\u2019s denying Navarro\u2019s point that there\u2019s some either/or choice between \u201cautocrat\u201d and \u201csocialist\u201d when, again, basic political reality cuts the other way. Navarro is annoyed because her ardent anti-Trumpism has turned her into a Democratic voter, whether formally declared or not, and one of Trump\u2019s core attacks next fall on the Democratic nominee will be to call him or her a socialist. I\u2019m not being cute about her affiliation either \u2014 this was published just a few weeks ago:\n\nAna Navarro-C\u00e1rdenas, a Florida GOP operative who backed Jeb Bush in 2016 and has been close to Sen. Marco Rubio, attended a Biden campaign event last weekend, sitting on the front row stroking her dog Chacha. Biden turned to her and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to sort of genuflect in this direction here because I\u2019m afraid of her. No. I\u2019m embarrassing her, I know \u2014 that\u2019s my intention. We\u2019ve been good friends for a long time.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s the most centrist member of the Democratic top tier, but given Navarro\u2019s relentless antipathy to Trump it\u2019s a cinch that she\u2019ll end up supporting Elizabeth Warren or even Bernie Sanders in the name of ousting the president. All she\u2019s trying to do here with Paul is neutralize the coming GOP electoral argument that Bernie/AOC-style democratic socialism will lead to Maduro-style Chavista socialism in due time if it\u2019s granted power. Trump was elected once before as a lesser of two evils; if he can convince voters that he\u2019s the lesser of two evils again, he might get another four years. Paul was about to make the case that \u201cgood socialism\u201d and \u201cbad socialism\u201d are less distinct than we might hope so she started huffing about \u201cmansplaining\u201d and successfully shouted him down.\n\n.@ananavaro was shouting over my answer \u2013 which was Maduro\u2019s violence and thuggery is made possible by the centralized power of his socialist government. @TheView should let guests answer! \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) October 11, 2019\n\nWhy is Navarro even on this show? If they\u2019re looking for a Democrat, they have plenty of those already. If they\u2019re looking for a Republican who hates Trump, they have Meghan McCain.
