De Blasio announced he would drop out of the 2020 race during an interview on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.\n\n\u201cI feel like I have contributed all I can to this primary election. It\u2019s clearly not my time, so I\u2019m going to end my presidential campaign,\u201d de Blasio said.\n\nBreaking: Bill de Blasio announces he is ending his presidential campaign pic.twitter.com/vL8GcX3xV5 \u2014 Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) September 20, 2019\n\nDespite a list of progressive accomplishments in New York, such as universal pre-K and raising the minimum wage to $15, what de Blasio contributed to the primary race was mainly an opportunity to make jokes at his expense.\n\nWere people in Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th congressional district rolling their eyes when their former congressman, Joe Sestak, entered the race? Maybe, but his entry into the race wasn\u2019t met with this cover story from his hometown paper:\n\nOh no, really big political news, perhaps the biggest story in years! Part time Mayor of New York City, @BilldeBlasio, who was polling at a solid ZERO but had tremendous room for growth, has shocking dropped out of the Presidential race. NYC is devastated, he\u2019s coming home! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2019\n\nThis is a breaking story.
