It is the largest known canvas by the anonymous street artist whose controversial creations have earned him global renown. It will be on show at Sotheby's for several days before the sale, just one mile from Westminster, where political chaos continues to reign.\n\nThe painting was first unveiled in 2009 as part of the groundbreaking Banksy vs. Bristol Museum exhibition . Then, earlier this year, it returned to the spotlight for another showing in Bristol to mark the date originally intended for Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, March 29, 2019.\n\nAt the time, the artist, famed for his dark humor and political commentary, offered the following explanation on Instagram : \"I made this ten years ago. Bristol museum have just put it back on display to mark Brexit day.\n\n\"Laugh now, but one day no-one will be in charge.\"\n\nThe quote makes reference to the first time Banksy featured chimpanzees in his work. Back in 2002, he produced another large painting of a row of glum-looking chimps in aprons emblazoned with the words: \"Laugh now but one day we'll be in charge.\"\n\nBanksy's Brexit mural depicted a workman chipping away at one of the stars in the European Union flag.
