The star defensive back said he has dealt with back issues throughout his NFL career.\n\n\u201cI went 51 straight games [before missing last week\u2019s game] where I started and played the whole game,\u201d Ramsey said on the latest episode of The Uninterrupted\u2019s 17 Weeks podcast. \u201cMy body was banged up, my back being extremely tight. Having back issues is something I\u2019ve had to deal with over the course of my NFL career.\n\n\u201cAt times I\u2019ve played through extreme pain or not practiced for weeks and tried to go out there and play. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve dealt with.\u201d\n\nThe 24-year-old cornerback, who previously asked Jacksonville to trade him, hasn\u2019t practiced with the Jaguars since their Sept. 19 win over the Tennessee Titans because of the injury and leaving the team to celebrate the birth of his second child.\n\nJags head coach Doug Marrone told reporters Friday that Ramsey will see a specialist to address his back ailment within the next week.\n\n\u201cJalen\u2019s been working extremely hard to get back with this low-back issue and it hasn\u2019t been getting any better,\u201d Marrone said. \u201cJalen has always been someone that\u2019s extremely diligent in what he has to do to get back on the field. One of the toughest guys that I\u2019ve coached when it comes down to injuries and fighting back from it.\u201d\n\nRamsey rejoined the team last Saturday and flew on the team plane to Denver. He was ruled inactive for the game against the Broncos, the first contest he has missed since the Jaguars selected him with the No. 5 overall pick in 2016.", "description": "Oct. 4 (UPI) \u2014 Jacksonville Jaguars standout cornerback Jalen Ramsey will miss his second consecutive game Sunday against the Carolina Panthers.
