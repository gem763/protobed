The same is true of construction, 45 down from 45.3, and manufacturing, 47.4 down from 48. The difference is the latter two sectors are now shrinking, as is business activity overall. UK plc only avoided a cricketing hat-trick because the video replay umpire didn\u2019t overturn a marginal LBW decision made on the field after the third ball.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBusiness expectations are at their lowest for three years, with economists starting to pencil in the first recession since the financial crisis, unless there is a dramatic pick up in September. It\u2019s hard to see where the fairy dust might come from.\n\nThese are the sort of figures that should be of deep concern to any sane and sensible government of whatever hue, all the more so to a Conservative government with its much ballyhooed, and largely undeserved, reputation for economic competence. In more normal times, they\u2019d scare the pants off it.\n\nBut these are not normal times and this is not a normal government. It is run by a party that has completely lost its marbles, having been dragged to the edge of a cliff by gangsters who have just one policy of note.\n\nThe global situation mightn\u2019t be terribly cheery, but the contraction that is getting underway in Britain is an entirely self created one, a squeeze manufactured in Downing Street.\n\nAnd remember, this could just be a taste of what\u2019s to come, a red balloon or two of warning of what Johnnywise the dancing clown of Downing Street could yet brings down on us as he emerges from his sinister house.\n\nThis brings us to another set of figures published this morning. They concern household debt and come courtesy of the TUC ahead of its annual Congress.\n\nThey give voice to the disturbing level of unsecured borrowing engaged in by the average Briton before one even starts to consider things such as mortgages.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It shows unsecured debt per household rose to \u00a315,880 in the first quarter of 2019, up a staggering \u00a31,160 on a year earlier.\n\nCredit card debt is its biggest component, followed by overdrafts, personal loans and car finance.\n\nUnsurprisingly young people are more likely to be downing in it than are their elders.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
