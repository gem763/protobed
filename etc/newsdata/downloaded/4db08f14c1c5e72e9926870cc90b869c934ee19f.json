Adhering to them can improve your performance as well as your standing at the health club and your all-important relationship with your fitness instructors.\n\nGreater risk for injury\n\nFirst, use the minutes when you're getting dressed for class to focus mentally. Get psyched for a serious workout and remind yourself that fitness boosts your motivation and enthusiasm.\n\nBeing on time benefits everyone. Lateness is more than distracting to your instructor and classmates. You miss out on the important warmup segment, warns the American Council on Exercise, and that puts you at greater risk for injury. If you're late for a personal trainer session, it throws off the rest of your trainer's schedule and means less time for you.\n\nOn the other hand, don't be shy about asking questions that will help you improve and possibly avoid an injury. Don't grin and bear it if a move hurts or if you're unsure of how to do it. If you can't get the attention of the teacher during class, bring up your concerns afterward \u2013 staying silent could just build resentment and get in the way of your progress. Your teachers want you to learn correctly and it's their job to teach you in a way that will benefit you.\n\nImage credit: iStock\n\n", "description": "Good gym etiquette makes for a more enjoyable and productive session \u2013 for you and other gym users.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9487/8e1920765dd8447ba54e81893748b8c1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
