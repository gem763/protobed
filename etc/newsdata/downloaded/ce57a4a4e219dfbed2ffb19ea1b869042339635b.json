On Wednesday afternoon by a vote of 327 to 299, they pushed the bill through a second stage in the two-step process.\n\nThe bill now goes to the House of Lords, which must give its assent.\n\nAfter a night of extraordinary theater in Parliament, Mr. Johnson had confronted on Wednesday a bleak scene scattered with the remnants of his Brexit policy and raising the possibility that the issue could destroy his premiership just as it has the two previous Conservative prime ministers, but more rapidly.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com World Europe Brexit-Boris-Johnson-Parliament.Html Smid Tw-Nytimes Smtyp Cur"], "top_image": ""}
