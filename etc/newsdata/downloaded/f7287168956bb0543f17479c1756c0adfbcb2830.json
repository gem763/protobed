There, travelers can get a glimpse of the silk history of Nanzhang and modern silk production too.\n\nAt the park, mulberry tea, wine and noodles are also available for tasting.\n\nThe park received about 1,200 travelers daily since its opening, according to Jin Kun, a tourism manager with the park.\n\nTourism has also boosted the local silk textile industry, Jin says.\n\nEvery year the local government stages various cultural programs at major scenic spots.\n\nAt the peach garden in Nanzhang's Shuxiangwan village, a peach picking festival has been held since 2015, drawing in visitors from far and wide.\n\nThe garden has 15 hectares of peach trees and made 210,000 yuan last year, says Yang Guojun, the founder of the garden.\n\nThe county has also produced songs, books and films to introduce the distinctive local culture and folk customs of the area to the public.\n\nEfforts have also gone into giving the villages a facelift while preserving their traditions, says Chen Zhongwu, the head of Nanzhang county's culture and tourism bureau.", "description": "Performers nimbly danced using two tall wooden sticks that were strapped to their feet, taking the audience's breath away in Beijing in late August.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/02/5d94264aa310cf3e979f9251.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
