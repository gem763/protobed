I was booed away from home in Brazil. I played in France away from home and I was booed.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s sad, but I know that all the games from now on will be away games. I have nothing against the fans or PSG. I don\u2019t need them to cheer my name or be there for me.\n\n\u201cI want them to be there for PSG,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThey say PSG is bigger than any player. They need to forget that player and support the team, that is more important than booing.\n\n\"It didn\u2019t bother me at all. It\u2019s very sad.
