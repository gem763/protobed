Sign up here.\n\nCentral banker Jerzy Kropiwnicki, absent from Poland\u2019s last two monetary-policy meetings because of illness, quickly extinguished any lingering suggestions he\u2019d team up with a minority of his colleagues angling for an interest-rate hike.\n\nTwo of the 10-strong Monetary Policy Council had sought to raise record-low borrowing costs in July, ending an unprecedented pause. The concern stems from consumer-price growth hitting a seven-year high and forecasts that it will climb further.\n\nBut for Kropiwnicki, who speaks less publicly than other MPC members and last gave an interview in April, the data so far aren\u2019t compelling enough to change tack.\n\n\u201cAs long as inflation is purely cost-related, its level isn\u2019t threatening the economy -- I wouldn\u2019t support the hike motion,\u201d he said Tuesday in an interview in Warsaw. \u201cSince the MPC has no impact on food or energy prices, and the economy is clearly slowing, putting rates on hold is the best solution.\u201d\n\nKropiwnicki\u2019s stance bolsters the position of Governor Adam Glapinski, who favors keeping the central bank\u2019s benchmark at a 1.5% for the foreseeable future. Despite the surge in inflation, there are grounds to hold steady: the global economy is slowing, while the world\u2019s major central banks are striking a more dovish tone.\n\nRaising rates could also prove controversial as the government seeks re-election in the fall.\n\nKropiwnicki could be persuaded to shift his view.\n\n\u201cSince higher costs may eventually raise inflationary pressure, I\u2019d see inflation expectations growing in importance,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re staying stable now, but if inflation gets rolling, expectations may actually become more important than direct sources of price growth.\u201d\n\nKropiwnicki sees the deterioration in Germany\u2019s economy weighing on Poland next year, though not to the extent that would require lowering interest rates. Growth, which has been hovering around 5% for two years, may ease to 2.5% to 3%, he said.\n\nCalls to loosen monetary policy could build as other central banks take that course of action to buttress their economies. Kropiwnicki vowed to do his best to withstand such pressure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already proved that the wisest monetary policy in our case is the policy of stable rates,\u201d he said. \u201cThe National Bank of Poland has a good record of staying calm in hectic situations.\u201d\n\n(Updates with more comments after chart.
