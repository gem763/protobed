Based on the outcome of the tender offer, SoftBank could own between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of WeWork but will seek to avoid consolidating the company on its books, one of the sources added.\n\nSoftBank and its $US100 billion Vision Fund already own about a third of WeWork through previous investments totaling $US10.6 billion.\n\nNeumann could step down from The We Company's board as part of the deal with SoftBank and become an adviser, according to the sources. SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure would succeed Neumann as chairman, the sources said.\n\nWeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Neumann declined to comment.\n\nWeWork has lined up Mizuho Financial Group as part of its syndication of the $US5 billion debt package, one of the sources said. The package comprises letters of credit for more than $US1 billion, as well as senior secured and subordinated bonds, the source added.\n\nMizuho did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe We Company\u2019s seven-member board tasked two directors with representing the interests of all investors in the company by sitting on the special committee considering the financing plans, Reuters reported earlier this week.\n\nOne is Bruce Dunlevie, who is a general partner at WeWork shareholder Benchmark Capital. The other is Lew Frankfort, who is the former CEO of luxury handbag maker Coach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtie Minson, previously WeWork\u2019s chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, who was a vice-chairman at the company, are now serving as its co-chief executives.\n\nFacing a cash crunch, WeWork is seeking to slow down its expansion, reducing the number of new property leases it is taking on.\n\nThe We Company\u2019s board has also agreed on a cost-cutting plan that includes layoffs, Reuters reported last week. The cuts will occur over the coming weeks, the sources added.\n\nNeumann's exit from The We Company's board would represent a dramatic fall from grace, given Wall Street's expectations earlier this year that he would lead one of corporate America's most hotly-anticipated stock market debuts.\n\nWhile Neumann's investors were willing to entertain his eccentricities since co-founding WeWork in 2010, his free-wheeling ways and party-heavy lifestyle came into focus once he failed to get the company's IPO underway.\n\nDuring the attempts to woo IPO investors last month, Neumann was criticised by corporate governance experts for arrangements that went beyond the typical practice of having majority voting control through special categories of shares.\n\nThese included giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donates to charitable causes.\n\nNeumann had also entered several transactions with We Company, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent. He has also secured a $US500 million credit line from banks using company stock as collateral.\n\nNeumann, 40, is not the first founder of a major start-up to be forced to step down recently. Uber Technologies co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned as CEO of the ride-hailing start-up in 2017 after facing a rebellion from his board over a string of scandals, including allegations of enabling a chauvinistic and toxic work culture.\n\nReuters", "description": "The We Company's board will meet to evaluate SoftBank's offer against an alternative financing proposal from JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1961%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bfd7a902284d7e30e21afceb8185540b8b8ca069", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
