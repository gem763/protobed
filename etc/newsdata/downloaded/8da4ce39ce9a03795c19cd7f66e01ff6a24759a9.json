He also vehemently denied any accusations that his campaign had been racist.\n\nBut he later posted a photo of the Palestinian flag projected over a Tel Aviv skyscraper warning his supporters if did not go out to vote, \u201cthis is how it will end\u201d.\n\nAs voting was underway he ratcheted up the messaging in a slew of videos warning of high Arab turnout.\n\n\"[The media] says the percentage of voters is surprising. It's high among the Arab population. It's not surprising. The Palestinian Authority is coming out with an official statement and I quote, 'go out to vote and bring down Netanyahu\u2019\u201d, he said to a crowd at Jerusalem\u2019s central bus station.\n\nYousef Jabareen, an Arab MK in the Joint List told The Independent that \u201cincitement against Arabs reached another record low this election, it was intense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIronically it encouraged Arab voters to get more involved. The anger motivated the community to go out and try to vote for change\u201d he added.\n\nAyman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List, which is a hodgepodge amalgamation of all the Arab parties, echoed the same point in an interview with the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cThere is no other prime minister who incited against us like Netanyahu,\" he told the AP.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a limit. The Arab citizens undoubtedly felt that they became a persecuted minority, an endangered minority.\u201d\n\nHe told reporters on Wednesday that higher Arab turnout was a critical factor in \u201cpreventing the establishment of an extremist right-wing government headed by Benjamin Netanyahu.\u201d\n\nMr Gantz called Mr Odeh to congratulate him on his election gains. Israeli commentators pointed out this marked the first time a leader of Mr Gantz\u2019s stature had made that kind of gesture to an Arab party.\n\nIsrael\u2019s estimated 1.9 million Arab population makes up around 20 per cent of the country and is largely comprised of descendants of Palestinians who either stayed within their communities or were internally displaced after the 1948 war that surrounded the creation of Israel.\n\nThey officially enjoy full citizenship, including the right to vote, but lived under martial law until 1966 and still suffer widespread discrimination.\n\nThe Druze, a unique Arabic-speaking religious and ethnic group that practices an offshoot of Islam, however, traditionally serves in the army, often identifies as Israeli and is fiercely loyal to the state. Many within the Druze community even dispute the label of Arab.\n\nThe the Arab and Druze turnout soared from just 49 per cent in April to nearly 60 per cent this time around, according to a report by the Israel Democracy Institute, a think tank which analysed the partial results.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
