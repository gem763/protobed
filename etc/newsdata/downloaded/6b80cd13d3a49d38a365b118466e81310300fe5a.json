We will take a comprehensive look to uncover these core recommendations, factoring respective salaries into the analysis.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nWe have 10 games on the docket tonight.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nJustin Verlander \u2013 Houston Astros (at Angels)\n\nSelecting pitchers during the final weekend is always a challenge. Today it\u2019s made even more difficult by extremely aggressive (high) prices for most of the palatable arms. Verlander is set to make a tune-up outing versus a deeply diminished Angels lineup. I still expect at least six innings with around seven strikeouts. He\u2019s by far the safest pitching option despite the risk for early removal. Don\u2019t let the Angels reputation as a low-strikeout team dissuade you from using Verlander \u2013 many of their injury replacements are extremely strikeout prone.\n\nAlso Consider: Adam Wainwright, Robbie Ray, Steven Matz (value)\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nJosh VanMeter \u2013 Cincinnati Reds (at James Marvel)\n\nStory continues\n\nWith Verlander and a pricey Coors Field game on call tonight, a few bargain targets are necessary. VanMeter represents one of the more attractive options. He\u2019s frequently used as the Reds leadoff man versus right-handed pitchers. He features a well-rounded batting profile which includes plenty of hard-hit, pulled fly balls. Although he only has eight home runs in 254 plate appearances, his peripherals suggest we should expect more in the future. His opponent, Marvel, is a soft-tossing ground ball pitcher. VanMeter has around a one-in-five chance to homer with plenty of other ways to deliver value.\n\nAlso Consider: Yasmani Grandal, Wilson Ramos (value), Pete Alonso, Eric Thames, Joey Votto\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nKeston Hiura \u2013 Milwaukee Brewers (at Chi Chi Gonzalez)\n\nHiura is one of those expensive Coors Field picks. With Ryan Braun sidelined by a calf injury, Hiura may be used as the cleanup hitter. The dynamic hitter has gotten away with big whiff rates by punishing pitches when he connects. His all-fields approach should play up at the expansive park. Every type of hit is buffed by Coors Field. In addition to a one-in-three chance to homer, Hiura offers upside for multiple hits and big run production.\n\nAlso Consider: Mike Moustakas, Gleyber Torres, Jose Altuve, Garrett Hampson (value), DJ LeMahieu, Ty France (value)\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nNolan Arenado \u2013 Colorado Rockies (vs Gio Gonzalez)\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to pass up any opportunity to use Arenado against a left-handed pitcher at Coors Field. He\u2019s hitting an absurd .315/.416/.611 with the platoon advantage. At home, he\u2019s posted a .351/.412/.645 batting line. In short, conditions are very favorable. One thing to keep in mind is the Brewers September roster usage. Their starters typically throw three to four innings. Milwaukee relievers are the club\u2019s unsung heroes. Disclaimers aside, Arenado is plenty effective against righties to use in this scenario.\n\nAlso Consider: Mike Moustakas, DJ LeMahieu, Alex Bregman, Eugenio Suarez, Matt Chapman (value), Manny Machado (value), Ty France (value)\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nMarcus Semien \u2013 Oakland Athletics (at Marco Gonzales)\n\nSemien is another well-known platoon masher. His splits have narrowed during this breakout season, but he still prefers facing southpaws. For his part, Gonzales doesn\u2019t have notable platoon splits. In fact, he\u2019s had more issues with fellow lefties this season, although that appears to be a small sample artifact. Semien should comfortably deliver a high floor, high ceiling profile as the Athletics leadoff man. Oakland is currently tied with the Rays so winning tonight\u2019s game is paramount. That means Semien can safely be expected to play a full game.\n\nAlso Consider: Trevor Story, Gleyber Torres, Alex Bregman, Didi Gregorius, Manny Machado (value), Seth Mejias-Brean (value)\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nTrent Grisham \u2013 Milwaukee Brewers (at Chi Chi Gonzalez)\n\nThe Rockies initially had Gonzalez penciled in to pitch yesterday, but they bumped him to today. Everything we said about Grisham still applies. Even though he\u2019s one of the priciest hitters in the slate, he\u2019s a dollar-for-dollar bargain as the Brewers leadoff hitter. A patient approach should serve him well against a poor-command pitcher like Gonzalez. Grisham\u2019s high-quality contact and adequate power will play up at elevation.\n\nAaron Judge \u2013 New York Yankees (at Adrian Sampson)\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t focus too closely on the nominal matchup for Judge. The Rangers will use an opener, and Sampson can\u2019t be expected to last very long. As such, Judge may only face him one time. Any chances he does get against Sampson figure to be high value \u2013 Sampson is homer prone and Judge is... well\u2026 Judge. There\u2019s around a one-in-three chance the Yankees second hitter goes yard versus Sampson and friends. Even though it\u2019ll be a bullpen game of sorts, Texas lacks intimidating relievers (Emmanuel Classe notwithstanding).\n\nAlso Consider: Yordan Alvarez, Charlie Blackmon, Aristides Aquino, George Springer, Giancarlo Stanton, Michael Brantley (value), Manuel Margot (value), Josh VanMeter (value)", "description": "Brad Johnson finds the best MLB DFS Plays for Saturday, September 28.
