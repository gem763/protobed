Nevils told Farrow that Lauer penetrated her in his hotel room, despite her repeatedly declining sex.\n\nBehind Matt Lauer's lovable image, the TV host was a divisive figure Read more\n\nLauer, who was fired from NBC in November 2017 after the network received a complaint from one of his colleagues about inappropriate sexual behavior, denied the allegations in a statement, saying the report \u201cdefied common sense\u201d.\n\nThe allegations in Farrow\u2019s book are the first time the specific rape accusation has been reported. Variety obtained a copy of the book ahead of its release on 15 October.\n\nIn the book Farrow also alleges NBC News prevented him from publishing a story about alleged sexual abuse by former film executive Harvey Weinstein. Farrow ultimately published the story in the New Yorker in October 2017.\n\nNevils told Farrow that she was covering the Sochi Olympics when Lauer invited her to his hotel room. She had taken six shots of vodka, Farrow writes, but \u201chad no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience\u201d.\n\nOnce in the room, Nevils said Lauer pushed her onto the bed, \u201cflipping her over, asking if she liked anal sex\u201d. Farrow writes: \u201cShe said that she declined several times.\u201d\n\n\u201cLauer, she said, didn\u2019t use lubricant. The encounter was excruciatingly painful. \u2018It hurt so bad. I remember thinking, Is this normal?\u2019\u201d Farrow continues, according to Variety.\n\n\u201cShe told me she stopped saying no, but wept silently into a pillow.\u201d Lauer then asked her if she liked it. She told him yes. She claims that \u201cshe bled for days\u201d.\n\nNevils told Farrow that she had sex again with Lauer in New York after the alleged Sochi assault. She said she had told multiple people about the incident, but said she was concerned about the influence Lauer could have on her career.\n\nIn a letter provided to Variety and published elsewhere, Lauer denied Nevils\u2019 account.\n\n\u201cIt is categorically false, ignores the facts and defies common sense,\u201d Lauer said.\n\n\u201cI had an extramarital affair with Brooke Nevils in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts. We performed oral sex on each other, we had vaginal sex, and we had anal sex. Each act was mutual and completely consensual,\u201d Lauer said.\n\n\u201cThe story Brooke tells is filled with false details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\n\u201cThere was absolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter. Brooke did not do or say anything to object. She certainly did not cry. She was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner.\u201d\n\nFarrow writes that after Nevils reported the incident to NBC News, her \u201cwork life became torture\u201d. In a statement released on Wednesday, NBC News said it had acted swiftly after receiving a complaint in 2017.\n\n\u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague,\u201d it said.", "description": "Farrow reports in Catch and Kill that ex-Today show host assaulted former NBC News employee Brook Nevils at the Sochi Olympics", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/465caed1e7ba489a025d93e26ee069b0e5409227/0_49_2584_1550/master/2584.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8cce5cc68c54de6d9d5fb9c1e293ca67", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
