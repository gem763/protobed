Falling rates led several banks to bring in lower-than-expected interest income over recent months, according to several banks\u2019 quarterly filings.\n\n\u201cThere are businesses it doesn\u2019t affect at all. And there are businesses where it just sucks into your margin and there\u2019s very little you can do about it,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nMarkets Insider is looking for a panel of millennial investors.

Though the former prediction never game to be, markets saw wild swings through the summer as the US-China trade war raged on and key recession indicators flashed their first warnings in decades.\n\nThe JPMorgan executive isn\u2019t the only one keeping negative rates in the realm of possibilities. Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said in August he wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Treasury yields reach negative rates, adding that such a move wouldn\u2019t be very significant anyway.\n\n\u201cThere is no barrier for US Treasury yields going below zero,\u201d Greenspan said. \u201cZero has no meaning, besides being a certain level.\u201d\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nCITI: Gold could shatter $2,000, reach all-time high if recession risks continue\n\nWall Street\u2019s biggest Boeing bull breaks down why the 737 Max fiasco has created a great buying opportunity\n\nThe heads of recruiting at Salesforce and Facebook have both told us that \u2018best day\u2019 questions are frequently asked in interviews.
