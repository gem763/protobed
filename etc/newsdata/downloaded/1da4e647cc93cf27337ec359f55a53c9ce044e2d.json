Elizabeth Warren is targeted by rivals for a second day as candidates seek a post-debate advantage", "language": "en", "text": "Joe Biden lobbed some of his most biting charges at her, questioning her honesty and saying her Medicare-for-all health plan \u201cis ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous.\u201d South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) stepped forward more assertively against Warren in the wake of persistent questions about Biden\u2019s own strength as the more moderate standard-bearer.\n\n\u201cLast night she was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she\u2019s taken than about how her plan is going to be funded,\u201d Buttigieg said on CNN.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShow your math and say how you\u2019re going to pay for Medicare-for-all,\u201d Klobuchar said in a separate interview.\n\nAs the party\u2019s fourth debate concluded, the Democratic primary contest opened a more robust and unpredictable clash over the ideological direction of the party, with moderates attempting to ignite the kind of passion that the liberal candidates have harnessed with large crowds and grass-roots donor networks. After months in which the race was largely static amid a crowded, free-ranging field, the nomination fight is showing signs of narrowing its focus to fewer candidates, divided into parallel feuds in the liberal and moderate wings of the party.\n\nWarren (Mass.) is entering a crucial phase of her campaign, taking attacks from all sides for the first time since she ascended in popularity, and attempting to demonstrate she can withstand the kind of scrutiny that previously fell mostly on Biden, who until recently held an unchallenged lead in the polls. Yet as she attempts to coalesce support on the party\u2019s left flank, Warren faces a renewed challenge from liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whose debate appearance helped alleviate questions about his health and whose new endorsements and deep bank account have made clear he has no intention of leaving the race.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe left\u2019s feud is replicated in the center, where Biden faces challenges from Buttigieg, Klobuchar and others.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time the candidates admitted that Warren is the front-runner. Nobody had onstage, next to her, pressure-tested her policies and statements before,\u201d Ben LaBolt, the national press secretary for President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign, said of the debate. \u201cBiden has always been a fragile front-runner, and I don\u2019t think you would call him the front-runner anymore. So if you are Buttigieg or Klobuchar, the most obvious play was to try to go after Biden supporters who seem more gettable now than they were six months ago.\u201d\n\nBiden on Wednesday also faced a striking problem for a former vice president with decades of Democratic connections: a lack of money. He only had $9 million cash on hand at the end of the third quarter, figures released late Tuesday showed. That was less than a third of the stockpile enjoyed by Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg, and the gap elevated fears of allies about his ability to compete if a contentious primary fight runs deep into next spring.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBiden on Wednesday dismissed concerns about his financing, and he pointed toward the advantage Warren and Sanders had in transferring money from their Senate accounts. He gave no hint to any cutbacks in spending, which included nearly $1 million for private charter flights in the third quarter. (Warren on Wednesday was spotted flying in coach on a commercial airline.)\n\nThe former vice president sought to focus instead on the lively squabble over Warren\u2019s liberal policies, particularly on health care, where she has largely yielded to Sanders. As he and others did during the debate, Biden questioned how she would pay for Medicare-for-all\u2019s significant costs.\n\nSanders, the author of the Medicare-for-all plan, has acknowledged it will require increased taxes. Warren supports his plan to extend coverage to everyone in the United States and abolish the private health insurance industry, but unlike Sanders she has yet to provide details about how she would pay for a bill estimated to cost $30 trillion over a decade.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoth assert that middle-class Americans would see lower costs overall. But economists have said it is impossible to make that guarantee given the details the candidates have put forward so far.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that the person with a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential issue in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board,\u201d Biden told reporters here before heading into a union hall in Columbus. \u201cAnd you know, credibility matters. . . . She\u2019s going to have to tell the truth or the question will be raised about whether or not she\u2019s going to be candid and honest with the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to pick on Elizabeth Warren,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBiden and his allies also ramped up their criticism of an answer Warren gave during the debate in which she said, \u201cI think we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East.\u201d She later clarified that she meant only combat troops.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was surprised last night in the debate one of my colleagues said we should remove all troops from the Middle East,\u201d Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event in Davenport, Iowa. \u201cWe can be strong and smart at the same time.\u201d\n\nSen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), who has endorsed Biden, said after the debate that Warren\u2019s comment showed Biden was \u201cclearly the stronger candidate in terms of being able to be commander in chief. She\u2019s really not prepared for that role.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, Warren\u2019s chief campaign strategist, Joe Rospars, said the debate had illuminated Warren\u2019s rise.\n\n\u201cLast night, in the face of more attacks from more candidates than anyone\u2019s taken on any debate stage so far, Warren fought back by making her case for what really matters without descending into petty sniping,\u201d Rospars tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty rare thing to see in politics.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe also pointed to filings released Tuesday that showed Warren had $25.7 million on hand at the end of September: \u201cShe\u2019s talked one-on-one with more than 70,000 people and isn\u2019t funding her campaign by charging $1,000 to schmooze and take photos with rich people behind closed doors.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhile Biden was aiming directly at a candidate who has met and sometimes exceeded him in recent polls, the strategy for Butigieg and Klobuchar was somewhat more nuanced: to try to persuade voters who may be leaning toward Biden that they are better positioned to articulate a path forward for the party, first against the liberal candidates, and then against Trump.\n\nKlobuchar on Wednesday remained focused on Warren and her health care plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly expensive. And it cuts 149 million people off their current health insurance in four years,\u201d Klobuchar said in a CNN interview Wednesday, reprising her comments from the night before. \u201cShe just needs to come out and say how she\u2019s going to pay for it. That\u2019s all. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. And we\u2019re waiting to see it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKlobuchar also took issue with Warren\u2019s tone.\n\n\u201cShe has repeatedly said . . . things like, \u2018You have to show you\u2019re going to fight for things,\u2019 and implying very clearly that those of us who have different approaches aren\u2019t fighting,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m fighting. I just think I have a better way.\u201d\n\nAlthough Klobuchar is far behind many of the other candidates in the polls and fundraising, her hope lies in surveys that show most voters haven\u2019t yet made up their minds and are willing to continue considering candidates.\n\nThe senator from Minnesota pitches herself as pragmatic and realistic; someone who, like Biden, can connect with white blue-collar voters, especially those in the Midwest. She has been campaigning heavily in Iowa and recently did a \u201cBlue Wall Tour\u201d of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 states that voted for Trump in 2016 after having sided with Democratic nominees for decades.\n\nAD\n\nFor his part, Buttigieg has grown more direct in his criticism of Warren over the past several weeks as he too focuses tightly on Iowa, a state that has catapulted past candidates to the nomination, most recently Obama. He has remained in the middle of the pack, lacking the opening that Biden\u2019s stumbles could provide.\n\nBoth Buttigieg and Klobuchar claim to represent a sensible Midwestern approach, but from a younger generation than Biden\u2019s.\n\n\u201cRight now you have a group of candidates who are positioned to capitalize if one of the front-runners falters in the early states,\u201d said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic consultant and pollster who runs Global Strategy Group and previously served as an adviser to the presidential campaign of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).\n\n\u201cAn upset in Iowa or in New Hampshire or Nevada could reasonably open up a lane for someone new,\u201d he added, pointing toward Buttigieg as well as Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). \u201cAll will be looking to be the alternative in the reasonable common-sense candidate lane.\u201d\n\nThe focus on Warren defused for now a continuing issue for Biden beyond his relative lack of money and supporter passion \u2014 the impact of questions about his son Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to join the board of a Ukrainian gas company while Joe Biden served as the Obama administration\u2019s point man in the country. Trump\u2019s effort to prompt investigations of the Bidens is at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nJoe Biden said he wouldn\u2019t have changed anything about his actions, including discouraging his son from joining the board, and had no regrets.\n\n\u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cBecause I never discussed with my son anything having to do with what was going on in Ukraine. That\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\nSanders, meanwhile, enjoyed a positive jolt from the debate, his first formal appearance since having a heart attack two weeks ago. After the debate, two prominent congresswomen \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) \u2014 endorsed Sanders, giving him another boost.", "description": "After a fierce debate, the Democratic presidential race narrows its focus as challenges to the front-runners arise on the left and among moderates.", "authors": ["Matt Viser", "National Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lIPRKPMr9fFcu-5RPDrh2CaFWqE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NO3HTSHQI4I6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
