That needs to stop: The stability of the global economy, as well as of the Middle East, may depend on it.\n\nEver since President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal between the Islamic regime and the major world powers, the European signatories have allowed their sympathy for Iran to cloud their view of events unfolding in the Middle East.\n\nAt the time, they protested that the deal was serving its limited purpose of pausing Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons, and characterized the U.S. pullout as reckless. They also feared that the Trump administration was building a case for a war \u2014 it didn\u2019t help that John Bolton, a longtime advocate of bombing Iran, was Trump\u2019s national security adviser. They criticized American economic sanctions and tried to preserve the deal long past the point of futility.\n\nThese were all arguably valid concerns. Since then, however, the Europeans have turned a blind eye to Iran\u2019s increasingly dangerous behavior in its neighborhood, even after its forces and proxies stepped up attacks on civilian shipping in the Persian Gulf and destroyed Saudi oil installations. France and Germany refused to join a U.S.-led naval effort to protect shipping in those waters; even Britain hesitated.\n\nWhen the regime broke past the uranium-enrichment limits imposed by the nuclear deal, the Europeans should at a minimum have issued clear denunciations. Instead, French President Emmanuel Macron suggested the Iranians be given sanctions relief and a $15 billion line of credit \u2014 essentially, a bribe to encourage compliance.\n\nThis endless indulgence has only encouraged Iran\u2019s progressively provocative behavior, culminating in Sept. 14\u2019s brazen drone-and-missile assault on giant oil installations in northeastern Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Europeans are right to fear a conflagration in the Gulf region, but they should by now recognize that it is Iran, and not the U.S., that is most likely to spark a war. Bolton\u2019s removal from the White House should clarify their thinking. However deep their distaste for Trump, they can\u2019t ignore his repeated offers to negotiate. Nor can they deny that Iran\u2019s actions are endangering the global economy.\n\nThe most powerful signal of disapproval the Europeans could send to Tehran would be to supplement American economic sanctions with their own \u2014 the nuclear deal they are so eager to protect, in fact, requires punitive action for breaching enrichment limits. They should also contribute naval assets to help protect the shipping lanes of the Persian Gulf from marauding Iranian speedboats.\n\nIf the prospect of standing behind Trump is too much for Europe\u2019s leaders to stomach, the next best thing would be to get out of the way. They should communicate to the regime that all efforts to save the agreement are suspended until Iran ends its aggression against its neighbors and resumes compliance with the nuclear deal. There must be no more talk of lines of credit and sanctions waivers. Instead, they should press Iran to take up Trump\u2019s offer of negotiations \u2014 with European mediation, if that helps \u2014 or face the consequences without German, French and British support.\n\n--Editors: Bobby Ghosh, Timothy Lavin.\n\nTo contact the senior editor responsible for Bloomberg Opinion\u2019s editorials: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net, .\n\nEditorials are written by the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In recent weeks, as Iran has lashed out at its neighbors, rekindled its nuclear ambitions, violently disrupted regional commerce, and issued not-so-veiled threats to the world, Europe has done little more than mollify and coddle the regime.
