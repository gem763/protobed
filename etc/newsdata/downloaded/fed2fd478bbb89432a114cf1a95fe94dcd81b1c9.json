(Airman 1st Class Mandy Foster/U.S. Air Force)\n\nHe pulled a person from a flaming vehicle in South Korea, served on President Trump\u2019s security detail during the historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and played a pivotal role in the widely publicized rescue of junior Thai soccer players trapped in a cave, during which he saved the life of a Thai Navy SEAL.\n\nIn recognition of those acts, U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Kenneth O\u2019Brien was named one of a dozen outstanding airmen of the year. But the Japan-based airman\u2019s impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 didn\u2019t end there. On a Sept. 11 flight back to the United States to pick up the award, the Air Force said, O\u2019Brien squeezed in another heroic act: resuscitating a baby that had lost consciousness after choking.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t decide if he\u2019s Superman or Mayhem (the guy on the insurance commercials),\u201d Lt.

Posted by AFSOC Commander on Tuesday, September 17, 2019\n\nA native of Bunker Hill, Ind., O\u2019Brien began his Air Force career 12 years ago, leaving for basic training shortly after graduating from high school. He had dreamed of jumping out of planes and helping people since he was 12 years old, calling it his \u201conly goal,\u201d the Air Force reported.\n\nNow, as a special tactics section chief assigned to the 320th Special Tactics Squadron at Kadena Air Base in Japan, O\u2019Brien is constantly looking for opportunities to step up.\n\n[A mistaken text from a stranger led this man to raise money for a sick boy he didn\u2019t know]\n\n\u201cIf someone needs to go do something dangerous, I volunteer,\u201d he said in the Air Force interview. \u201cIf someone needs a leader, I volunteer. I happened to be in the right place at the right time, and that\u2019s what helped me stand out because I sought out key positions or responsibilities.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 2018, O\u2019Brien was instrumental in creating the plan to rescue the Thai soccer players and coach stranded inside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave, which made him the American farthest inside the cave, according to the Air Force. He was the first person to reach the children as they made their escape, and told the Air Force that getting the last one out was \u201ca big moment.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Time is running out\u2019: Inside the treacherous rescue of boys trapped in a Thai cave]\n\nDespite his many daring feats, O\u2019Brien said he was \u201cshocked\u201d to learn he had been named one of the outstanding airmen of the year for 2019.\n\nBut on his flight from Okinawa to Dallas to accept the award during the Air Force Association conference, he proved himself a hero once again. While on the plane with his family, he noticed a 1-year-old choking. He sprang into action, clearing the child\u2019s breathing passage and performing CPR, the Air Force said. He checked on the baby for the rest of the flight.\n\nO\u2019Brien, as usual, was modest about the lifesaving act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful that the child is okay and that I was able to help when the family needed support,\u201d he said. \u201cI happened to be in the right place at the right time.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHe disclosed his 2-year-old\u2019s cancer in a TED Talk.
