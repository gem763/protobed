We have seen this here in Melbourne.'\n\nJames Gargasoulas mowed down pedestrians in a stolen car (pictured) and killed six in January 2017\n\nThe new policy doesn't replace the current pursuit policy but acknowledges there may be circumstances where a pursuit evolves into a hostile vehicle attack.\n\nThe aim is to empower officers to take appropriate action and authority to act when lives are in danger.\n\n'Protecting the community is our number one priority and by releasing this policy we are trusting our officers to assess the situation and act accordingly,' Deputy Commissioner Paton said.\n\nPolice will undergo compulsory online and face-to-face training to ensure they're aware of their options and associated risks so they can make rapid decisions.\n\nAll officers are expected to have completed the training by mid next year.\n\nThe new policy was developed over the last 18 months in consultation with The Police Association of Victoria, which welcomed the new policy.\n\nSix pedestrians died and 27 were injured in a Bourke Street rampage in January 2017\n\n'It provides them with the confidence, clarity and support that they need to make sound decisions that will save lives and keep the community safe,' association secretary Wayne Gatt told The Herald Sun.\n\n'We have seen a rapid escalation in vehicular events in Victoria.'\n\n'They are extremely high risk to the safety of the community and they are among the most stressful and difficult situations for police and PSOs to contain and resolve.'\n\nGargasoulas was sentenced to life behind bars with a non-parole period of 46 years earlier this year.\n\nNoori was also sentenced to life behind bars with a non-parole period of 30 years.", "description": "Police in Victoria will get extra new powers to use drastic force and shoot at vehicles being used as  weapons in the wake of James Gargasoulas' deadly Bourke Street rampage in 2017", "authors": ["Kylie Stevens For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/23/20259792-0-image-a-33_1572218985521.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
