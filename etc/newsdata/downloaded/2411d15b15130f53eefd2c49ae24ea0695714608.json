At one point, court documents indicated that Uwanawich asked for jewelry. \u201cFailure to do so, the victim was led to believe, would result in harm to her and her family.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship continued even when Uwanawich moved to South Florida. All told, her services rung up a $1.6 million tab for the allegedly cursed woman.\n\nFederal prosecutors announced Monday that Uwanawich had been ordered to serve time and pay full restitution to her victim. She had previously pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.\n\nThe scheme came to an end in 2014, prosecutors say, when Uwanawich informed her victim that she could not, in fact, lift the curse.\n\nBut Uwanawich\u2019s lawyer, James Stewart Lewis, told The Washington Post that his client was forced into fortune telling by her family, who are members of the Romani community (also known as Roma). He also claimed that she had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which led her to believe that she had psychic abilities.\n\nCourt documents show a request for a psychiatric evaluation of Uwanawich, but Lewis said the actual evaluations are under seal.\n\n\u201cUnder all the circumstances I think her sentence is pretty harsh,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel bad for her.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA woman who ran for president in 1872 was compared to Satan and locked up.
