It\u2019s more than half of them. Some fine investigative work by Sludge in partnership with the Guardian has produced a deep dive into the investment portfolios of United States Senators and their spouses, finding troubling alignments between the companies they are profiting from and the ones they are charged with overseeing. Does that sound like it should be illegal to you? Would you be terribly shocked if I told you it wasn\u2019t? (insider.com)\n\nFifty-one US senators and their spouses have up to $96 million invested in corporate stocks, raising conflict of interest concerns because many of them could pass laws that help those businesses and thus enrich themselves. An analysis by Sludge and the Guardian \u2014 a deep dive you can check out here\u2014 looked at the senators\u2019 disclosed stakes totaling $28 million to $96 million across finance, defense, health, communications and electronics, and energy and natural resources companies. Members of Congress aren\u2019t legally barred from owning stock in companies they oversee, but having a vested interest in their success could affect their impartiality and willingness to pass laws that hurt those businesses.\n\nThis is not a red problem or a blue problem. It\u2019s a bipartisan green problem that spreads across both sides of the aisle. Alabama Republican Senator Sen. Richard Shelby comes in near the top of the pack (or should that be bottom?) with somewhere between one and five million dollars worth of stock in private real estate insurance firm Tuscaloosa Title Company. Shelby sits on both the Senate housing and insurance subcommittees, so he\u2019s responsible for oversight of that industry and his decisions have a direct impact on that company\u2019s fortunes.\n\nQuite a few members of the Senate Banking Committee hold stocks in the financial sector. The report lists Doug Jones (D-AL), John Kennedy (R-LA), and Robert Menendez (D-NJ).in that category. Really? Bob Menendez has this sort of potentially profitable conflict of interest? Who could have seen that one coming?\n\nWhat\u2019s rather ironic in this story is that some of these Senators are the same ones that have been very keen on investigating President Trump\u2019s business holdings to make sure that he\u2019s not profiting from being in office. Of course, that\u2019s a proper question to raise because of the emoluments clause if we\u2019re talking about foreign holdings or cash. But we don\u2019t seem to have a specific rule preventing the members of Congress from holding investments in the same industries they hold regulatory power over.\n\nEven if it\u2019s not technically illegal, that still doesn\u2019t mean you should do it, however. If you\u2019re voting on some new regulation that might directly impact the company\u2019s worth, causing the value of your stock to either rise or fall, that\u2019s got to be something that\u2019s taken into consideration, right? Take, for example, Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) who sits on the Senate Technology and Consumer Protection subcommittees. When she\u2019s making decisions about whether or not to clamp down on the tech sector, do her sizable investments in Microsoft, Intel, AT&T, and Verizon weigh on her mind?\n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019m not really sure what we do with this information. Since they aren\u2019t technically breaking the law, what\u2019s to be done aside from pushing for a change in the rules? Senators don\u2019t have to put their wealth in a blind trust as the President does. What would be really interesting to see is whether or not any of these Senators made any major buying or selling moves shortly before some bit of news broke that heavily impacted the companies in question. Perhaps some information that only the members of those committees would know because it was based on an upcoming vote? That\u2019s pretty much what got Congressman Chris Collins of New York in trouble as I recall.", "description": "Conflict of interest?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/RichardShelby.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
