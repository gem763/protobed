But they were destined to lay the foundation of the Roman Empire in Italy.\n\nThe vengeful goddess Juno, seeking to stop them, ordered Aeolus, the god of the winds, to hit them as hard as he could. Neptune, the god of the sea, stopped the storm and spared Aeneas -- and, according to Virgil's story, the future of Rome.\n\nThis line from Virgil occurred to me aboard a cruise ship, as we peacefully sailed from a port near Rome, past Sicily, toward Greece and Turkey -- heading in exactly the opposite direction as Aeneas.\n\nThe seas were calm. The skies were blue. It was hard to imagine what Aeneas went through.\n\nAs pantheistic as \"The Aeneid\" is, Virgil wrote it only decades before the birth of Christ -- the same century during which another great Roman, Cicero, wrote his \"Treatise on the Commonwealth,\" which has been quoted in this column.\n\n\"There is a true law, a right reason, conformable to nature, universal, unchangeable, eternal, whose commands urge us to duty, and whose prohibitions restrain us from evil,\" Cicero wrote. \"Whether it enjoins or forbids, the good respect its injunctions, and the wicked treat them with indifference. This law cannot be contradicted by any other law and is not liable either to derogation or abrogation.\"\n\n\"Neither the senate nor the people can give us any dispensation for not obeying this universal law of justice,\" Cicero said.\n\n\"It is not one thing at Rome and another at Athens; one thing today and another tomorrow; but in all times and nations this universal law must forever reign, eternal and imperishable,\" he wrote.\n\n\"It is the sovereign master and emperor of all beings,\" said Cicero. \"God himself is its author, its promulgator, its enforcer. He who obeys it not, flies from himself, and does violence to the very nature of man.\"\n\nAs these lines demonstrate, Cicero was not a pantheist. He wrote of one God, whose universal law applied to all human beings in all times and all places.\n\nIn Rome, the ruins of the Colosseum, built in the first century after the birth of Christ, are within walking distance of St. Peter's Basilica, whose dome was designed by Michelangelo in the 16th century and whose piazza was designed by Bernini in the 17th century.\n\nThe interior of the Colosseum may have witnessed hideous things, but its classical beauty is rooted in the same immutable rules of harmony and proportion that guided the designs of the Renaissance.\n\nA little more than a century after Bernini designed the Piazza San Pietro, our Founding Fathers declared the United States an independent nation, appealing as they did so to \"the Laws of Nature and Nature's God\" and stating that all men \"are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.\"\n\nThomas Jefferson later described the Declaration of Independence as \"an expression of the American mind\" and cited the writings of Cicero as one of its inspirations.\n\nThat new nation, which embraced the immutable principles articulated by Cicero, soon built a beautiful capital city, whose major structures, such as the Capitol and the White House, reflected the same basic architectural principles as classical -- and Renaissance -- Rome.\n\nBased on that same principle Cicero articulated two thousand years ago, America became the freest and greatest nation on Earth.\n\nIn 1969, two American astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, planted our flag on the moon -- a profoundly symbolic moment for a nation that had reached higher than any other both morally and physically.\n\nSince Apollo 17 in 1972, we have not returned to the moon.\n\nBut we have aborted many millions of babies, declared it a \"right\" for two people of the same sex to marry and begun a national debate about whether a young man can declare himself a young woman and begin using the ladies' room.\n\nAt the same time, our federal government has run up a debt of more than $22 trillion.\n\nThe advice Aeneas gave to his men in the wake of that fictional storm that Virgil put into verse more than two thousand years ago could never be applied to the cultural challenge America faces today.\n\nWe will never look back on these conflicts with any sort of mirth.\n\nBut, hopefully, someday soon we will look back and know that we not only weathered the storm but also turned the ship back in the right direction.", "description": "The always-amiable Father Andrew Gilligan, who for many years taught .09/18/2019 19:20:05PM EST.", "authors": ["Terry Jeffrey", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/3/95df72b5-c547-492f-ad1c-9cef0525a50c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
