Osteoarthritis - sometimes called 'wear and tear' - is a condition that occurs when the surfaces within joints become damaged. Cartilage covering the ends of bones gradually thin over time, and the bone thickens, according to Versus Arthritis. Around a third of people aged 45 years and over in the UK suffer from the condition. This equates to roughly 8.75 million people. At least 20 million are known to suffer in the US. It is different to rheumatoid arthritis, a long-term illness in which the immune system causes the body to attack itself, causing painful, swollen and stiff joints. Replacement joints are often necessary for osteoarthritis patients, because the joint has been worn down and causes agonising pain.\n\nProfessor Goodacre said: 'This work is very exciting because it involves scientists and clinicians working together as a team to develop an entirely new approach. Potentially, this could transform ways in which knee osteoarthritis is managed.\n\n'It will enable better diagnosis, and will enable treatments to be tailored more precisely according to individual knee condition.\n\n'It will also enable faster, bigger and better clinical trials of new treatments'.\n\nCurrently, osteoarthritis is diagnosed by X-Rays coupled with self-reported pain symptoms.\n\nBut the study's authors said that X-Rays correlate poorly with pain symptoms and cannot diagnose early knee osteoarthritis.\n\nOsteoarthritis can occur in any joint, but is usually present in knees, hips and hands.\n\nAround a third of people aged 45 years and over in the UK suffer from the condition.\n\nThis equates to roughly 8.75 million people. At least 20 million are known to suffer in the US.\n\nRegular exercise and losing weight if you are overweight is recommended as a treatment for arthritis.", "description": "A team of British scientists found that inaudible high-frequency sounds are emitted from a person's joints.
