Chi said Vietnam would be more resilient.\n\n\u201cWe are not the shooting star,\u201d she declared.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just come on the scene to stay for one year... in order for a grand prix to be successful, you have to be sustainable.\n\n\u201cHow do you stay in the business? That\u2019s what we can learn from the unsuccessful ones.\u201d\n\nChi said the key lay in creating a satisfying experience for fans and in the longer term growing motorsport\u2019s popularity among a local population more focused on soccer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a sense of pride, it\u2019s a sense of responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to deliver this event successfully.\u201d\n\nTOURISM BENEFIT\n\nFormula One considered racing in Vietnam when Bernie Ecclestone was the sport\u2019s commercial boss but the Briton ruled it out, despite significant sums on offer, because he felt the region had enough races already with Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nEcclestone was ousted in 2017 and a deal with Vietnam\u2019s largest conglomerate Vingroup JSC was signed last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that tourism will benefit,\u201d Chi said of the race. \u201cBut there are other things that we think it will bring, such as investment, promotion, technology, opportunities for businesses in Vietnam to connect with businesses in the world.\n\n\u201cBesides all that, we also want to showcase to the world that Vietnam and Hanoi can actually organise a world-class event.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Vietnamese Grand Prix - Hanoi circuit - Hanoi, Vietnam - April 20, 2019.

We are developing, we are moving forward very quickly, we are the new dragon of Asia.\u201d\n\nFormula One has long expanded from its European origins, with now-departed Malaysia added in 1999 as a second race in Asia after Japan.\n\nChina joined the list in 2004, Singapore in 2008 and there are now also two races in the Middle East.", "description": "Vietnam Grand Prix organisers are confident their race will join Singapore in lighting up the Formula One calendar for years to come, rather than adding to the list of Asian shooting stars, after it debuts in 2020.", "authors": ["Abhishek Takle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433019874&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1K2", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
