Dressed in a navy sports jacket, white shirt and gray slacks, he betrayed no emotion and only spoke twice, answering \u201cyes, your honor\u201d to Judge Sam Medrano when asked if his name was correct on the indictment, and \u201cnot guilty\u201d when asked for his plea. He was in and out of the courtroom in about three minutes.\n\n'We're heartbroken': El Paso mourns as funerals for shooting victims begin Read more\n\nSecurity had been beefed up in and around the courthouse. Sheriff\u2019s deputies set up metal detectors and x-ray machines to screen everyone entering the building. The courtroom seating 100 was packed.\n\nThe Texas killings were followed just 13 hours later by a mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, where a gunman wearing body armor and a mask killed nine people and wounded 27 others before he was shot dead by police.\n\nThe back-to-back massacres sparked a political outcry, with the El Paso native and Democratic party presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke demanding the mandatory confiscation of the assault-style rifles often used in mass shootings.\n\nThe El Paso shooting prompted powerful Texas Republicans including the governor, Greg Abbott, and the lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, to retreat somewhat on their staunch defense of gun rights.\n\nBoth floated the idea of requiring universal background checks on people seeking to buy guns and talked about \u201cred flag\u201d laws that would allow people to petition a court to have an individual\u2019s guns taken away. Even so, no concrete legislative action has yet taken place in Texas.\n\nCrusius is accused of driving 11 hours to El Paso from his hometown of Allen, near Dallas, on 3 August and firing at shoppers with an AK-47 rifle inside a Walmart store. He surrendered to officers who confronted him outside.\n\nCrusius confessed while surrendering and told police he was targeting Mexicans, according to an El Paso police affidavit released days after the shooting. Most of those killed were Latinos.\n\nA four-page statement believed to have been written by the suspect and posted on 8chan, an online message board often used by extremists, called the Walmart attack \u201ca response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas\u201d.", "description": "Patrick Crusius was indicted last month for capital murder and will face death penalty if convicted, said district attorney", "authors": ["Reuters In El Paso"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/127e2aa307c170da162f685fefba9d49aabd5bad/0_290_5046_3027/master/5046.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e0b60c18a4d28874a17946de1631fd71", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
