Among them was the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which subjects the city\u2019s special U.S. trading status to annual reviews and provides for sanctions against officials deemed responsible for undermining its \u201cfundamental freedoms and autonomy.\u201d\n\nWhile the legislation must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump to become law, it already has strong bipartisan support in the Republican-run upper chamber. The Hong Kong measures was passed by the Democrat-controlled House by unanimous voice votes Tuesday.\n\nChinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang warned American lawmakers to stop meddling in China\u2019s internal affairs \u201cbefore falling off the edge of the cliff,\u201d without specifying how it would retaliate. The House action \u201cfully exposes the shocking hypocrisy of some in the U.S. on human rights and democracy and their malicious intention to undermine Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability to contain China\u2019s development,\u201d Geng said.\n\nThe threat dented investor appetite for risk, with S&P 500 Index futures slipping 0.2%. The offshore yuan also dropped as much as 0.3% to 7.1049 against the dollar after the statement.\n\nBoth Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have so far prevented the international uproar over Hong Kong from scuttling their trade talks. The two sides went ahead with negotiations and reached some broad agreements last week, even though the House vote was widely expected at the time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this will undermine the prospect of signing a partial deal next month,\u201d said Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China\u2019s cabinet and founder of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing. \u201cThe Hong Kong bill is not a done deal and there is still room for redemption.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Hong Kong government \u201cexpressed regret\u201d over the House action, which came hours before Chief Executive Carrie Lam was slated to deliver her annual policy address. Earlier this week, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Hong Kong\u2019s central district urging the legislation\u2019s passage as sign of international support, many of them waving American flags.\n\nU.S. lawmakers have embraced the Hong Kong protesters\u2019 cause as the yearlong trade war fuels American support for pushing back against China, and they have hosted some of the city\u2019s activists on Capitol Hill in recent weeks. The National Basketball Association\u2019s struggle to manage Chinese backlash against a Houston Rockets executive\u2019s support for the movement has only focused wider attention on the debate.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House passed H.Res. 543, a resolution reaffirming the relationship between the U.S. and Hong Kong, condemning Chinese interference in the region and voicing support for protesters. Lawmakers also passed the Protect Hong Kong Act, H.R. 4270, which would halt the export to Hong Kong of crowd-control devices such as tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nRepresentative Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican and a sponsor of the main Hong Kong bill, predicted that the Senate would pass the legislation and dismissed the threats from Beijing.\n\n\u201cRetaliation, that\u2019s all they ever talk,\u201d Smith told Bloomberg TV. \u201cThey try to browbeat and cower people, countries, presidents, prime ministers and the like all over in order to get them to back off. We believe that human rights are so elemental, and so in need of protection. And that\u2019s why the students and the young people are out in the streets in Hong Kong virtually every day.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the House adopted a resolution by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel of New York and the panel\u2019s top Republican, Michael McCaul of Texas, urging Canada to start U.S. extradition proceedings against Huawei Technologies Co. executive Meng Wanzhou. The resolution, H.Res. 521, also calls for the release of two Canadians detained in China and due process for a third sentenced to death for drug smuggling.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- China threatened unspecified \u201cstrong countermeasures\u201d if the U.S. Congress enacts legislation supporting Hong Kong protesters, in a sign of the deepening strain between the world\u2019s two largest economies as they attempt to seal a trade deal.China\u2019s foreign ministry issued the warning Wednesday", "authors": ["Iain Marlow", "Daniel Flatley", "Dandan Li"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RCvtnaM8Yi6mp0jMdDBpGQ--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/76a21b9d5ae2f673dccbdda261b638b5", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
