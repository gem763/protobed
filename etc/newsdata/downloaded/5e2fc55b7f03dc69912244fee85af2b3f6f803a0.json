We\u2019re talking about human life. These are human beings.\u201d Glezman maintains that his brother-in-law has \u201cmanipulated\u201d and \u201cweaponized\u201d the Bible to appeal to a wider demographic of liberal Democrats, which makes him \u201ca false teacher,\u201d as far he\u2019s concerned.\n\n\u201cWhat we see is a modern-day Pharisee,\u201d said Glezman, referencing the 1st-century Jewish sect that was notorious for demanding its followers adhere to an exhaustive list of trivial laws to earn God\u2019s favor. \u201cButtigieg is a person who\u2019s making up their own rules and regulations and, basically, if we don\u2019t celebrate and endorse their interpretation of Scripture, our religion is fallible. And that\u2019s just not true.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Jon Brown", "Washingtonexaminer.Com News A-Modern-Day-Pharisee-Buttigiegs-Evangelical-Brother-In-Law-Urges-Him-To-Repent-Of-Abortion-Views"], "top_image": ""}
