As of the time of publication, Lambda School's website was still up and still included a form where students can apply for the school.\n\nLambda School disputes the comments made by the Department of Consumer Affairs, and says that it can operate as per usual while an appeal to the citation is pending. Lambda School first received the citation in March, which it appealed in April.\n\nWoodcheke says that the appeal from April was denied, and the citation was affirmed in July. He also says there is no appeal on the affirmed citation on file.\n\nHowever, Cecilia Ziniti, Lambda School's general counsel, says that its appeal is still pending, and that the company is awaiting a hearing. She said that while the citation was affirmed by an administrative chief, it has not been affirmed by an administrative judge, and thus hasn't come into effect.\n\n\"We're working with them and working to come into compliance,\" Ziniti told Business Insider. \"We're working diligently on the application and getting some questions answered. We expect this to resolve as quickly as we can.\"\n\nThe citation\n\nLambda School has attracted a lot of attention for its unconventional business model: Rather than pay tuition, most students learn the fundamentals of programming for free over the internet, and then Lambda School takes a percentage of their salary for the first two years after they get a job in tech.\n\nHowever, according to the citation, the issue is that Lambda School also offers the option for students to pay $20,000 for tuition, which, in the bureau's view, means that it should have registered with the BPPE. The BPPE, which is part of California's Department of Consumer Affairs, oversees the private higher education market in the state. While Lambda School's programs are all online, it's headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nWoodcheke also said that Lambda School has yet to pay the $75,000 fine, which already came due. That's because Lambda School first received the citation in March, which it appealed. However, he says, the citation was upheld, of which Lambda School was informed on July 24th, according to the BPPE.\n\nZiniti says the fine is not due, thanks to its pending appeal. Again, however, the BPPE says that while it recognizes that Lambda School appealed the original citation in March, the fact that it upheld the citation in July means that this fine is due.\n\n\"Ideally we want these schools to be in compliance, and we hope Lambda completes that process,\" Woodcheke told Business Insider.\n\nEarlier this week, Allred told Business Insider that he welcomed the BPPE's oversight.\n\n\"We're happy to be regulated,\" Allred said at the time. \"We're happy to work with regulators. We're not trying to be one of those companies that avoids regulation. It makes a lot of sense when schools are regulated when they charge tuition so we're happy to comply.\"\n\nGot a tip?
