But while we're still not sure the exact date of release, we know for a fact the entry Mate 30 model won't be coming to Australia.\n\nHuawei Mate30 Pro Is Coming To Australia and The Specs Are Here Huawei's upcoming Mate 30 Pro is one of the most talked-about devices this year and it's as much about the phone as it is about the political turmoil surrounding it. After Trump banned Google from working with Huawei, the phone's release details \u2013 and whether it would come with an Android OS or Google apps \u2013 was unclear. With its official announcement in Germany, we can finally reveal what's in store for the world's number two smartphone brand after Samsung. And it's huge. Read more\n\nGizmodo Australia asked Huawei Australia why only the more expensive Pro model, which was announced overnight on Thursday, was on the way to our shores and why we wouldn't be getting the cheaper, Mate 30.\n\n\"Feedback from Australian consumers is that they loved the features on the Mate 20 Pro more than then Mate 20 so we are giving customers what they want by only bringing the Mate 30 Pro,\" a Huawei Australia spokesperson said in an email.\n\n\"The silver and black colours have been the most popular, which is why they\u2019ve been chosen for Australia.\"\n\nThe Mate 30 Pro sure packs some serious (technological) heat. Fitted with Huawei's latest chip, the Kirin 990, it comes with a four huge rear lenses and some pretty impressive selfie cameras to make you look dazzling without a hitch. Also, its slow-motion feature is out of this world.\n\nBut if you don't need all the highest specs the standard Mate 30 fares just fine and would definitely save you some cash. It's got the same souped-up Kirin chip as the Pro, a minor megapixel downgrade in the rear and selfie cameras and wireless charging.\n\nWith the launch of the #HuaweiMate30 Series, the smartphone just became the superphone.
