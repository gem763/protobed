Among them was the interior minister, a powerful position responsible for domestic security.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe United States is holding the Turkish Government accountable for escalating violence by Turkish forces, endangering innocent civilians, and destabilizing the region,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a statement that said the administration is prepared to impose more sanctions on Turkey if needed.\n\nThe Treasury Department said the sanctions are not meant to disrupt humanitarian aid to Syrian civilians, but some aid groups already have started to pull their workers out of northeastern Syria.\n\nAD\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Turkey\u2019s military operation threatens regional security and will exacerbate the humanitarian crisis. He said that to block more sanctions from being imposed, \u201cTurkey must immediately cease its unilateral offensive in northeast Syria and return to a dialogue with the United States on security in northeast Syria.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe administration has faced increasing, bipartisan pressure from Capitol Hill on imposing sanctions against Turkey, which last week began a military offensive targeting U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters into northern Syria after Trump\u2019s announcement that the United States would soon begin withdrawing U.S. forces from the region.\n\nThat decision has prompted an unusual outcry of criticism from GOP lawmakers who have otherwise hesitated to criticize Trump, his rhetoric and his administration\u2019s actions.\n\nAD\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday that he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d by the escalating situation in Syria and \u201cby our nation\u2019s apparent response thus far.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor years, the United States and our Syrian Kurdish partners have fought heroically to corner ISIS and destroy its physical caliphate,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAbandoning this fight now and withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria would re-create the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper confirmed Sunday that virtually all U.S. forces in northern Syria would be withdrawn as part of Trump\u2019s directive. In his statement Monday, Trump said a \u201csmall footprint\u201d of U.S. forces are staying in At Tanf Garrison in southern Syria \u201cto continue to disrupt remnants\u201d of the Islamic State.\n\nAD\n\nThe White House in May cut the tariffs it imposed on steel imports from Turkey from 50 percent to 25 percent. The higher tariffs had been imposed when Trump was trying to pressure to Erdogan over the detention of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson.\n\nBrunson was released just over a year ago, and he is scheduled to deliver the opening prayer in the Senate later this week to mark that anniversary.\n\nTurkey was the eighth largest steel exporter in 2017, according to the Commerce Department. Roughly 5 percent of its exports in 2018 went to the United States, and higher costs could cut U.S. imports by driving up costs.\n\nAD\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has estimated that total trade between U.S. and Turkey was $24 billion in 2017. That figure is nowhere near the $100 billion referenced by Trump, but in June, the president said at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, that the United States was looking to quadruple its trade with Turkey as he met with its leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nAD\n\nEven though Turkish steel doesn\u2019t make up a large percentage of U.S. imports, Trump has boasted about its importance in the past. He said last week that Turkish steel is used as the \u201cstructural steel frame for our F-35 Fighter Jet.\u201d So it\u2019s possible that pushing up the cost of Turkish steel could push up the cost for the U.S. government to purchase airplanes.\n\nCarol Morello contributed to this story.\n\nAD", "description": "Trump also said tariffs on steel imports from Turkey will be raised 50 percent, and that the U.S. has halted negotiations over a $100 billion trade deal with the country.", "authors": ["Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hHeuSoIhUMuwXGoFYrnV_gSAN9I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B25MBSHMOYI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
