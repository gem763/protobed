It was ranked third after Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces. However, the province has faced a problem with lagging economic drive.\n\nZhao Zhongxiu, president of the Shandong University of Finance and Economics, said the FTZ in Shandong should focus on institutional innovation and find a unique way of high-quality economic growth, with its optimized geographic position and abundant resources.\n\n\"The province should take the free trade zone opportunity to become more involved in the China-Japan-South Korea regional economic cooperation, as well as the Belt and Road Initiative, and play a bigger role in improving exchanges of capital, technology, talent and information between east and west,\" said Zhao on the sidelines of the High-Level Forum of Shandong Pilot Free Trade Zone Development Strategy on Oct 17 in Qingdao, a coastal city in Shandong.\n\nThe forum invited officials and scholars from across the country to discuss how to build high-quality pilot trade zones.", "description": "Eastern Chinese province banks on FTZ to boost trade in Northeast Asian region", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/23/5dafaf23a310cf3e97a28772.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
