Newsom for using homeless crisis to overturn will of voters", "language": "en", "text": "Attorney Jim Breslo said Wednesday that California Gov. Gavin Newsom overturned the will of California voters by using the homeless crisis as an excuse to impose statewide rent control in an attempt to address a housing shortage.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s [Newsom is] trying to use a crisis to do things that he wasn\u2019t otherwise able to do,\u201d Breslo told \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t get statewide rent control approved by the voters.\"\n\nBreslo published a Fox News op-ed this week that noted California voters, in November 2018, defeated a statewide ballot initiative that would have enforced rent control statewide.\n\nJIM BRESLO: TO HELP HOMELESS, CALIFORNIA TURNS TO DUMB IDEA LOVED BY THE LEFT \u2013 AND GUARANTEED TO FAIL\n\nAccording to Breslo\u2019s op-ed, the measure was rejected by a 20-point margin and every county in the state except for San Francisco voted it down.\n\nAlthough Newsom previously opposed the initiative, the former lieutenant governor and mayor of San Francisco changed his position and plans to sign a statewide rent-control law.\n\nBreslo wrote in the op-ed, \u201cProgressives assert that the homeless crisis is due in large part to a housing shortage, and that the best way to address the shortage is with rent control. The new law also protects tenants from eviction without good reason and provides compensation to tenants if they are evicted due to renovation.\u201d\n\nCALIFORNIA SALON OWNER BLASTS GOV.
