It\u2019s got a 17-inch screen, yet at 2.95 pounds weighs less than many 15-inch laptops and nearly the same as some 13-inch models. Having recently reviewed the airy Acer Swift 5, I find the Gram\u2019s efficiency even more impressive \u2014 but it\u2019s also far more expensive. The only configuration that LG offers is $1,699.99, which nets you an 8th Gen Core i7 chip, 512GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM. Instead of offering multiple SKUs, LG apparently decided on one size that should fit most (who can afford it). Right now, the laptop is discounted a bit to $1,549.99.\n\nThe main question to answer for yourself is whether you can settle with a smaller laptop screen. If you can, there are better options for the same money. But if not, there\u2019s nothing else quite like the Gram 17 on the market.\n\nOur review of LG Gram 17 Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Beautiful 17-inch screen in a laptop so light it feels fake\n\nExcellent performance for everyday PC usage\n\nNice selection of ports including Thunderbolt 3 Bad Stuff There\u2019s a lot of flex\n\nNo dedicated GPU despite high price\n\nDisplay isn\u2019t a touchscreen\n\nTruly horrendous speakers Buy for $1,549.99 from Best Buy Buy for $1,549.99 from LG\n\nAs with LG\u2019s other Gram machines, the 17-inch version has a nanocarbon magnesium exterior that, to anyone holding it, might as well be plastic. That\u2019s due to the texture, but also to the amount of flex you\u2019ll sense when hammering away on the keyboard deck. Even the top display casing will easily bow if you put pressure on it. But if you believe LG, you needn\u2019t worry about how pliable the Gram 17 feels: it\u2019s rated for MIL-STD 810G durability and designed to endure a tumble here and there. So yes, a laptop can be tough even if it\u2019s not sturdy and doesn\u2019t inspire confidence.\n\nThere\u2019s no other laptop quite like this one\n\nBut what the Gram lacks in rigidity, it makes up for in sheer screen size. There will be no competing with you at the coffee shop or at office meetings. And the Gram 17 might even be workable on some trains and flights since the 17-inch screen is housed in a laptop not much bigger than most 15-inch portables. The one trade-off in the Gram\u2019s ultra-slim bezels is that there\u2019s no Windows Hello face recognition since LG only had room for a tiny camera above the display. Instead, the power button doubles as a fingerprint reader, and its accuracy is on point. I only had one or two failed scans in several weeks of using the Gram 17. One very tiny thing I love about the Gram is how easy it is to open one-handed; it stays firmly put when you pull up on the lid, which I didn\u2019t expect for its barely there weight.\n\nLG also packs in a great assortment of ports, including one Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C, two USB 3.0 Type-A, a full-size HDMI output, a microSD card slot, and the usual headphone jack, Kensington lock, and barrel charger options. The Gram 17 can charge over USB-C, but you\u2019ll want to be careful if you rely on that alone and ditch the stock 48-watt charger. At one point the battery on my review unit was so depleted that it wouldn\u2019t respond to power from USB-C, and I actually thought the laptop had completely died somehow. I opened up the bottom (good news: the RAM and SSD are user-upgradeable) and looked around for any loose cables. Nope. Eventually I plugged in LG\u2019s charger and the charging LED came back to life. Crisis averted.\n\nCombine a screen this big with Windows 10\u2019s multiple desktops, and you\u2019ll become a productivity maestro in no time. You\u2019re able to see so much in split screen and can focus on two things without having to squint or hunch over to get work done. Hopping between your desktops \u2014 I set up different ones for general, work, and entertainment \u2014 with a four-finger swipe is simple. The Gram 17 is not going to compete with top-tier laptops from Dell or Razer in terms of overall performance, but its U-series processor and generous amount of RAM pack all the power you need for everyday tasks. I piled on the browser tabs, documents, and video streams and the laptop didn\u2019t exhibit any slowdown.\n\nHowever, the Gram 17\u2019s lack of a dedicated GPU inherently means you won\u2019t be doing any serious video editing (beyond 1080p) or extensive photo editing on it, so LG isn\u2019t exactly using that expansive screen to its full potential. Gaming is going to be ruled out unless you run an external GPU into that Thunderbolt 3 port, but you can do photo editing in Lightroom without one. The Gram 17 is a mainstream lifestyle PC, which is why I said there are better options if you prioritize power over screen real estate. Similarly, the Gram\u2019s SATA SSD is slower than the NVMe flash drives in other machines \u2014 another thing many people won\u2019t notice that power users might.\n\nThe Gram\u2019s IPS display is beautiful and very sharp on account of its WQXGA (2560 x 1600) resolution. And the slightly taller-than-average 16:10 aspect ratio gives you a little extra space to work with in Word documents or when editing photos. This screen isn\u2019t capable of showing as wide of a color range as pro-tier laptops, but everything is vibrant and eye-pleasing regardless. The screen is awfully reflective, enough that you\u2019ll certainly notice it and will want to avoid bright lights if they\u2019re behind you and will bounce off the screen. Still, there\u2019s something very absorbing about the picture from this display. I think it comes down to the excellent contrast and black levels; 1440p YouTube videos look very lifelike, and animated content like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse pops off the screen. However, it\u2019s not a touchscreen, and I find Windows 10 can feel a little imprecise and less refined when you don\u2019t have that option for interacting with it. On the plus side, LG\u2019s added software isn\u2019t as annoying as what other PC makers throw at you and can be easily uninstalled.\n\nWhat the Gram lacks in rigidity, it makes up for in screen size\n\nBut back to the screen\u2019s benefits. Even when you\u2019re just watching YouTube inside a regular Chrome window \u2014 forget full-screen mode \u2014 the video looks positively huge. You can shrink Chrome to fill only half the display and you\u2019ll still be able to fit an entire iPhone XS Max (or other large honking phone of your choice) inside the resulting YouTube video player.\n\nI feel truly spoiled when using this laptop for media consumption \u2014 well, for video anyway. The Gram 17\u2019s speakers are a wretched disappointment. They sound lifeless, lack bass, and have the worst possible placement at the bottom of the laptop. It\u2019s a real shame, because you can comfortably rest the Gram 17 on your lap for hours of TV or movie viewing, but the sound just doesn\u2019t measure up to what you see.\n\nThe Gram 17\u2019s keyboard has a number pad at its far right, which I appreciate, but the main keys are off-center and pushed to the left as a result. As someone who\u2019s not accustomed to this, there was definitely a learning curve to typing comfortably and quickly. The trackpad deserves partial blame for that, as it\u2019s still right in the middle of the chassis despite the keyboard\u2019s layout. If it were also a bit more to the left, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be dealing with nearly as many typos. Alignment critiques aside, both the keyboard and trackpad (which uses Microsoft\u2019s Windows Precision drivers) work wonderfully.\n\nBattery life is satisfactory for the screen size. The 72Wh capacity should power you through an entire workday. For me, it hovered between six to eight hours, depending on how hard you push it and how conservative you are on Windows\u2019 performance / battery slider. But you\u2019ll be teetering near empty if you don\u2019t plug in at some point.\n\nThe Gram 17 is wholly unique on the laptop market, but that also means it\u2019s for a very specific person. A giant screen \u2014 even if it can\u2019t be used for super intensive PC tasks \u2014 in this unbelievably light package will justify the $1,700 price for some. If you can go smaller, you\u2019ve got no shortage of more powerful (and less flexible) laptops from Microsoft, HP, Dell, Asus, and others to choose from. But the 17-inch Gram is the sort of computer that\u2019s hard to forget after you\u2019ve used it for a bit. If your brain doesn\u2019t remind you of what could\u2019ve been, your back will.", "description": "The 17-inch LG Gram puts a giant display in a laptop that weighs just 2.95 pounds, far less than most 15-inch notebooks and close to some 13-inch models.
