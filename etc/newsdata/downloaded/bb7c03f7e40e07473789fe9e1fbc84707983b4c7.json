It enables real-time digital payments across Australia.\n\nHalverson has done his own independent analysis of the Latitude prospectus. This led him to make the following comments.\n\nHe said the average credit card balance of $3384 was low by Australian and international standards. He said credit cards issued by the banks had balances of about $7000.\n\nHalverson compared the Latitude credit card balances and default rates to those in the US. He said the 3.5 per cent default rate in Australia on average balances of $3384 compared poorly with the 6.3 per cent default rate on average balances of $9000 in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Latitude prospectus reveals quite a lot about how the business has evolved under the ownership of its private equity owners, KKR, Varde Partners and Deutsche Bank.\n\nGeneral Electric ramped up the growth of the Australian business of GE Money in the lead-up to the global financial crisis. But after the crisis it is apparent there was little, if any, investment in the business.\n\nPrivate equity bought the business in 2015 and was then forced to replace its outdated legacy computer systems. The prospectus shows the private equity owners invested about $200 million transforming the business prior to a potential IPO in 2018.\n\nThe 2018 IPO collapsed because of uncertainty about consumer demand. It is noteworthy that when the brokers spruiked the 2018 IPO opportunity Latitude was described as a \u201cconsumer finance\u201d company.\n\nWhen Ahmed Fahour took over as chief executive of Latitude last year he realised the buy-now, pay-later sector was eating Latitude\u2019s lunch. Buy-now, pay-later has contributed to the lowest growth in credit card receivables in Australia in more than a decade.\n\nFahour bought a buy-now, pay-later business in New Zealand called Genoapay and is now rolling this business out in Australia. Halvorsen believes the buy-now, pay-later market is peaking as shown by the reduction in growth rates and sharp fall in interest margins.\n\nFahour is spending about $100 million updating Latitude\u2019s systems. This tells you the first effort at this by the private equity owners was not optimal.\n\nHalverson says it is notable that Latitude only has about 2.6 million customers out of a total potential population of 30 million in Australia and New Zealand. He says the forecast return on equity at Latitude for 2020 of 20 per cent is low compared with the leading credit card companies in the US, which have return on equity of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe major Australian banks have return on equity ranging from 12 per cent to 14 per cent.\n\nMarket interest in Latitude\u2019s IPO is said to be strong because of the dividend yield of 5.4 per cent at the lower end of the range and 4.6 per cent at the upper end of the range. Also, the earnings multiple of about 12 times - in the middle of the IPO pricing range - is low relative to the multiple being paid for the S &P ASX200.\n\nThe low multiple for Latitude compared to the 17 times earnings of quality diversified financials says that Latitude's owners recognise this is not a fast growing digital payments outfit.", "description": "Latitude Financial promotes itself as a digital payments company when it's really a credit card company riding on the payment systems of Visa and Mastercard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7811%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1ebdc7031c00410efa9c3fd2f10fa34eea05288a", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
