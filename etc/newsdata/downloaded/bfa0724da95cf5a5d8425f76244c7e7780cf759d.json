With a focus on creating a broader, more solid acoustic note, DBX\u2019s exhaust system has been tuned to reflect a deep bass with increasing mid-tones, creating true auditory exhilaration, particularly in more sporting drive modes.\u2019\n\nExtensive \u2018everyday real-world driving\u2019 and high-performance track evaluation has taken place around the world - including at Aston Martin\u2019s two key engineering centres at Silverstone in the UK and on the N\u00fcrburgring, Germany.\n\nDBX will use a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine \u2013 developing 550 horse-power equivalent to five Ford Fiestas \u2013 making it the highest performing V8 engine in the brand's range\n\nThe car firm noted: \u2019While conducting durability testing at the demanding N\u00fcrburgring race circuit, DBX has delivered cornering speeds on par with the brand\u2019s most focussed sportscar Vantage, while achieving braking figures greater than the marque\u2019s Super GT, DBS Superleggera.\n\n\u2018This brutal combination of performance for an SUV has already seen Aston Martin\u2019s engineering team regularly achieve sub 8-minute Nordschleife lap times during their regular testing regime.\u2019\n\nAston Martin\u2019s chief engineer Matt Becker said: \u2018We have concentrated our work to ensure that the calibration and tune of this 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 delivers both the everyday usability and refinement expected by SUV owners.\n\n\u2018However, we have also focused heavily on matching that with the engaging driving dynamics that are commanded by our brand and inherent in every Aston Martin and early indications of the car\u2019s overall performance have been incredibly promising.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2019The next few months will be extremely important to us, as we continue to hone the powertrain credentials and a dynamic setup that will help make this the most exciting SUV on the market\u2019.\n\nPre-production models of the DBX started rolling out from the firm\u2019s second factory at St Athan near Cardiff in Wales in June, and lightly disguised versions have been seen on test on roads at home and abroad.\n\nIt is expected to be priced between \u00a3140,000 and \u00a3160,000 and to become the company\u2019s biggest seller with around 5,000 sales a year by 2021 with the UK, USA and China among the key markets.\n\nThe DBX is due to be fully unveiled in December this year and on sale from early 2020 from around \u00a3160,000\n\nAston Martin bosses have been clear they are targeting wealthy female customers as key buyers of the new SUV including adding details as a slot to keep their handbags when driving.\n\nAnd while Aston Martin\u2019s traditional sports cars and coupes may appeal to male fans of 007 who drives them on screen, the new DBX will also appeal to Mrs Bond and her children. The aim is to spread the appeal of the brand to more women.\n\nA spokesman Aston Martin, whose headquarters and first factory are in Gaydon, Warwickshire, said: \u2019We do intend to make this car much more female-friendly. Until now our customer base has been predominantly male. Except for China where it is 50:50.\n\n\u2018We want to broaden that out. We\u2019re not talking about making cars only for women, but rather to make our cars more practical for women and families, as well as men.\u2019\n\nThe spokesman said to that end the firm had set up a female advisory panel to pass on their opinions and recommendations with a view to incorporating them into the finished cars.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re doing that with the DBX and will do it with all future Astons. It\u2019s not just James Bond but Jane Bond and all their little Bond\u2019s we\u2019re thinking of.\u2019\n\nExtensive \u2018everyday real-world driving\u2019 and high-performance track evaluation has taken place around the world - including at Silverstone in the UK (pictured)\n\nAston Martin chief executive Dr Andy Palmer said testing among wealthy SUV owners suggested the DBX is seen as \u2018neither male nor female biased.\u2019\n\nThe St Athan plant, a former RAF airfield, has so far created 200 jobs which will rise to 750 as production ramps up. A further 3,000 jobs are expected among local suppliers and businesses.\n\nIt has capacity to build 7,000 cars a year, of which 2,000 are planned to be all-electric Lagonda branded vehicles. The Gaydon plant has a similar capacity of 7,000 vehicles \u2013 sports cars and coupes. Last year Aston Martin made 6,400 cars.", "description": "The British luxury car-maker confirmed that the new DBX will be powered by a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine - developing 550 horse-power.
