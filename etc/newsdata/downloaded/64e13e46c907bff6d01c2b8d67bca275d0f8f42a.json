It's obviously very sad that someone should make such allegations.\"\n\nMr Johnson also said it was \"inevitable\" he would face \"shot and shell\" because of his stance on Brexit.\n\nBut after No 10 first denied the accusation on Sunday evening, Ms Edwardes tweeted: \"If the prime minister doesn't recollect the incident then clearly I have a better memory than he does.\"\n\nCustoms posts\n\nThe BBC's Iain Watson said according to leaked proposals, the government accepts there must be customs checks on the island of Ireland, but they would be conducted away from the border.\n\nCustoms formalities would be carried out mostly where goods originate or at their final destination.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border?\n\nThe Irish broadcaster RTE had reported that a \"string of customs posts perhaps five to 10 miles away from the frontier\" had been floated by the UK.\n\nBut Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said the plans were a \"non-starter\", tweeting that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland \"deserve better\".\n\nThe prime minister told Breakfast: \"They are not talking about the proposals that we are actually going to be tabling.\n\n\"They are talking about some stuff that went in previously.\"\n\nHe would not reveal details of the proposals to be put to the EU, telling Today he \"would like to veil our proposals in decent obscurity\" before sharing them.\n\nBut Mr Johnson said this was the \"moment the rubber hits the road\" and the UK would making \"a very good offer\".\n\nHe also insisted the government had made \"a great deal of progress\" in negotiations since August, and they were working \"flat out to get a deal\".\n\nJust as with Theresa May, customs is proving to be the sticking point for this prime minister.\n\nHe, however, is taking a different attitude towards what a potential solution might be.\n\nBoris Johnson explicitly denied the suggestion that came out overnight that there will be a string of customs points on either side of the Irish border.\n\nHowever, we heard him clearly accept that the concept of having more checks will be part of the proposal he puts to Brussels in the next couple of days.\n\nSo, an explicit denial on the specifics of this idea, but an acceptance this concept is something real, is something that the UK government is going to pursue and that, of course, is extremely difficult for the other side.", "description": "But the PM rejects reports there could be a series of customs posts set five or 10 miles back.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07ps1dx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
