But now she likes chicken curry, all-day vegetarian breakfast and lots of vegetables.\n\n'She just needed a push into the right direction and now that we have got the momentum going, it is easy.\n\n'I am able to pick her school dinners online and we sit down and discuss what she would like to try. She can have two stickers if she steps out of her comfort zone.\n\n'At the end of the week, if she has eaten all her dinners, I give her a medal and we can do an activity of her choice like baking.\n\n'Scarlett-Mai now enjoys most foods and she gets so excited to tell me at the end of school - her new favourite dish is cheesy leek and ham pie.'\n\nSingle mother, pictured with Scarlett-Mai on her graduation day, also said her daughter's schoolwork has improved thanks to the genius hack\n\nThe idea sprung to mind after the mother introduced a reading book chart and noticed Scarlett-Mai\u2019s enthusiasm towards books had changed.\n\nShe picks five books a week to read and is rewarded with stickers \u2013 Karis says even her teachers have noticed the improvement.\n\nShe adds: 'Kids need a push in the right direction, and I have helped Scarlett-Mai by using my imagination.\n\n'These days a lot of parents my age are glued to their phones and only half-heartedly help their kids with homework and reading.\n\nThe mother from Heywood, Manchester, pictured holding her daughter, said she decided on the idea after a reading chart encouraged her daughter to look at more books\n\n'Whereas I make sure I dedicate 30 minutes of my day to Scarlett-Mai\u2019s reading without any distractions.\n\n'It has made our relationship stronger and her confidence is sky high. She is getting better and better.\n\n'I was told at parents evening that her reading has improved, and she has started to buckle down at school.\n\n'Kids love to feel appreciated and the extra half an hour reading every night means the world to her.\n\n'She receives a certificate for her reading which only takes me a few minutes to create, but they mean so much to her and gives her a sense of accomplishment.'\n\nTo see more of Karis and Scarlett-Mai follow @youngmumsdiaries on Instagram..", "description": "Music theatre graduate Karis Turner, 23, from Heywood, Manchester, got daughter Scarlett-Mai to try greens, salmon fish cake, Quorn cottage pie and others using a colourful wall chart.", "authors": ["Luke Andrews For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/08/20024514-0-image-a-3_1571730377194.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
