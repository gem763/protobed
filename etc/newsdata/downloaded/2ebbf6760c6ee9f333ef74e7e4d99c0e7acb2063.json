It has struggled in recent years, issuing a string of profit warnings in 2016 and 2017.\n\nAdvent has a track record in buying British technology, having snapped up electronics company Laird for $1.65 billion last year, and Cobham investors approved the takeover on Monday.\n\nSome Cobham operations, such as its Advanced Electronic Solutions unit, have special security agreement status that allows them to bid for U.S. defence contracts.\n\nCobham Chief Executive David Lockwood said on Monday that requirement would disappear under Advent ownership, enabling the group to combine infrastructure and share knowledge more quickly and easily within the company.\n\nLockwood said he had already held some discussions with government about the takeover but would not go into details.\n\n\"Advent is committed to being a responsible steward of Cobham, encouraging its future growth and success,\" a spokesman for the U.S. group said. \"We will continue to engage constructively and cooperatively with the UK Government in this part of their review.\"\n\nCobham shares slipped 0.5%, with the stock at 160 pence per share, just below the offer price of 165 pence.", "description": "Britain to investigate $5 billion U.S. takeover of defence firm Cobham", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8H0IY_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
