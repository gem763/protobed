He said \u201cI\u2019ve always loved Bob Dylan\u201d and referred to the singer-songwriter winning the 2016 literature prize and refusing to participate in Nobel ceremonies.\n\nPeebles said, laughing: \u201cI can\u2019t forgive him for not showing up to the scene of (his) Nobel prize\u2026.It\u2019s very disconcerting.\u201d\n\nHe said he looks forward to traveling to the Swedish capital with his wife and two surviving children to accept his prize since \u201cwe haven\u2019t been to Stockholm for many years.\u201d\n\n___\n\n3:00 p.m.\n\nSwiss astronomer Didier Queloz was meeting with other academics who are interested in finding new planets when the press office at Cambridge University interrupted to tell him the big news: He had won a Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nQueloz thought it was joke at first. Then he \u201ccould barely breathe.\u201d But he deemed his experience hearing about the monumental honor that swamped his emotions and made his hand shake on Tuesday and as \u201cthe perfect way to bring me back to reality.\u201d\n\nQueloz told the Associated Press: \u201cThe good part was I was surrounded by all my colleagues. That was really helpful \u2013 old friends, the people I know for some time. It was perfect way to bring me back to reality. It\u2019s enormous. It\u2019s beyond usual emotions.\u201d\n\nThe 53-year-old Queloz, part of the Astrophysics Group of Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge says he can\u2019t believe his good fortune since he won the prize doing work he loves.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is just a dream job\u201d\n\n___\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nA University of Cambridge astronomer says the work that earned three scientists the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics \u201chighlights astronomy as the grandest of the environmental sciences.\u201d\n\nEmeritus Professor Martin Rees said the work recognized Tuesday reflects an apparent broadening of the Nobel committee\u2019s criteria for the physics prize.\n\nHe says astronomy typically has been included when a discovery involves a new element of physics, such as neutron stars or gravitational waves.\n\nThe scientists won this years\u2019 physics prize for their contribution to the understanding of the evolution of the universe and \u201cEarth\u2019s place in the cosmos.\u201d\n\nOne half was given to James Peebles \u201cfor theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology,\u201d and the other half to Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz \u201cfor the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star.\u201d\n\nRees said in a statement that Queloz and Mayor\u2019s discovery of the first planet orbiting an ordinary star \u201chas led to the discovery of many thousands of other planetary systems.\u201d\n\nHe called Peebles \u201cthe most influential and respected leader of empirical cosmology\u201d spanning half a century.\n\n___\n\n2 p.m.\n\nA member of the Swedish Science Academy has recited the first lines of the theme song of TV show \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d that \u201cour whole universe was in a hot, dense state. Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started \u2026\u201d\n\nAt a news conference where the winners were announced, professor Ulf Danielsson used a transparent cup with black coffee, poured milk in it and added a pinch of sugar to illustrate the work of the laureates of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics\u2014 James Peebles, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is the dark energy, then a fair amount of cream, this is the dark matter, and then just a tiny little bit of sugar. This is the ordinary matter, this is what science has been all about for thousands of years.\u201d\n\nDanielsson went on, \u201cWe had thought that other solar systems would be similar to our own. We were wrong.\u201d\n\nPeebles was cited \u201cfor theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology\u201d while Mayor and Queloz \u201cfor the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star.\u201d\n\n___\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nTwo Swiss scientists are celebrating their Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering a planet outside our solar system orbiting a solar-type star.\n\nThe University of Geneva has quoted Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz as saying that \u201cthis discovery is the most exciting of our whole career and for it to be rewarded with a Nobel Prize is simply extraordinary.\u201d\n\nMayor and Queloz announced their discovery of the planet, known as 51 Pegasi B, 24 years ago. Mayor recalled that \u201cno one knew whether exoplanets existed or not. Prestigious astronomers had been searching for them for years, in vain!\u201d\n\nCanada-born James Peebles, who won the other half of the award \u201cfor theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology,\u201d was asked what he would tell young scientists. He told a news conference that \u201cyou should enter it for the love of science. You should enter science because you are fascinated by it.\u201d\n\n___\n\n11:45 a.m.\n\nThree scientists have won the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics for their contribution to the understanding of the evolution of the universe and \u201cEarth\u2019s place in the cosmos.\u201d\n\nOne half of the award was given to James Peebles \u201cfor theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology,\u201d and the other half jointly to Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz \u201cfor the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star.\u201d\n\nThey will share a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award, a gold medal and a diploma. The laureates will receive them at a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10.\n\n___\n\n9:35 a.m.\n\nThe 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics will be awarded Tuesday, a day after two Americans and one British scientist were awarded the award for Physiology or Medicine.\n\nThis year, the Nobel week will include an award in chemistry \u2014 to be announced Wednesday \u2014 two literature laureates, the coveted Nobel Peace Prize and the economics award.\n\nThis year\u2019s double-header Literature Prizes will be awarded Thursday and the Peace Prize will be announced on Friday. The economics prize will be awarded on Oct. 14.\n\nThe 2018 literature prize was suspended after a scandal rocked the Swedish Academy. The body plans to award it this year, along with announcing the 2019 laureate.\n\n___\n\nRead more stories on the 2019 Nobel Prizes by The Associated Press at https://www.apnews.com/NobelPrizes", "description": "STOCKHOLM (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the Nobel Prize in Physics (all times local): 3:15 p.m. Princeton University cosmologist James Peebles says he answered a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/e84e5f_sweden-nobel-physics-64435-ulf-danielsson-member-nobel-committee-talks-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
