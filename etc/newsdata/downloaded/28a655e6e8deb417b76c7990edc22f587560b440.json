The work of female filmmakers throughout cinema history is too rich and too vast for anything less.\n\nCousins\u2019 epic film, which has been playing throughout the Toronto International Film Festival, is not a chronological history but a personal, roving exploration of a cinema terrain often forgotten, overlooked or underappreciated. It digs deeply into the artistry of some 183 female directors from throughout film history and around the globe. Its abiding tenor is one of awe, reverence and celebration.\n\n\u201cThis is a film school of sorts in which all the teachers are women: an academy of Venus,\u201d introduces Tilda Swinton, a narrator and producer.\n\nCousins, the Scotland-based documentarian and film critic, grants \u201cWomen Make Film\u201d could have been a more standard 90-minute movie, but that would have done its subjects a disservice.\n\n\u201cIf we say there\u2019s a forgotten history or a sequestered history, the physical size of the piece needs to speak for itself,\u201d Cousins, outfitted in a \u201cMasculine Feminine\u201d T-shirt, said in an interview \u201cIt\u2019s not like there have been little crumbs dropped back through film history. There are massive histories that have been forgotten.\u201d\n\nAlong with Swinton, \u201cWomen Make Film\u201d is narrated by Jane Fonda, Adjoa Andoh, Thandie Newton, Kerry Fox, Sharmila Tagore and Debra Winger. Swinton opens the documentary with the matter-of-fact declaration: \u201cMost films have been directed by men. Most of the recognized so-called movie classics were directed by men. But for 13 decades and on all six filmmaking continents, thousands of women have been directing films, too. Some of the best films.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen Make Film\u201d charts, instead, \u201ca new road movie through cinema\u201d that aspires to upend much of the traditional, male-dominated understanding of film history.\n\nIt passionately argues that \u201cLynchian\u201d - the surreal characteristics of David Lynch\u2019s films - ought to, perhaps instead, be first associated with the Ukrainian filmmaker Kira Muratova, whose movies were censored in the Soviet Union. It exalts Mia Hansen-Love\u2019s floating camera in \u201cThings to Come\u201d (2016), the sense of home in Lynne Ramsay\u2019s \u201cRatcatcher\u201d (1999) and the staging of Joanna Hogg in \u201cUnrelated\u201d (2007). The memorable tracking shot of Chantal Akerman\u2019s 1993 documentary \u201cFrom the East\u201d - a slow pass across the faces of people awaiting transportation in Eastern Europe - Cousins\u2019 film maintains, is on par with anything Orson Welles ever did.\n\n\u201cForget gender for a moment. The playing field is not level. There\u2019s something wrong with our film culture if we don\u2019t talk about that shot,\u201d says Cousins.\n\nCousins\u2019 equally ambitions 900-minute \u201cThe Story of Film: An Odyssey\u201d (2012) similarly assembled a loving and singular journey through film that bubbles with wonder. \u201cWomen Make Film,\u201d Cousins estimates, took four years to make, all the while without funding. But the more proper timeline, he says, spans a lifetime of movie watching.\n\nIn those four years, attention and frustration has only grown for the wide disparities between women and men in the film industry, particularly behind the camera. Research studies have found that last year, just 8% of the directors for the top 250 films at the U.S.-Canada box office were directed by women, a three percentage point decline from the year before.\n\nWhat Cousins wants to contribute to the ongoing dialogue is a closer and more informed study - and sheer enjoyment - of the work.\n\n\u201cYes, man - or woman - the barricades. Yes, get angry. But if you have no sense of where it\u2019s coming from, there\u2019s a danger of making arguments that aren\u2019t actually true,\u201d says Cousins. \u201cI just worry that the debate is under-imagined. If we say the film industry hasn\u2019t let women make films - which is broadly true - there\u2019s a risk that we re-sequester these women. We write them out of history for a second time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen Make Film\u201d was quickly acquired in Toronto. Cohen Media will release it in theaters, with Criterion Collection set to stream it and television rights going to Turner Classic Movies. Kanopy took rights to show it in schools and public libraries. TCM\u2019s vice president of programming, Charles Tabesh, credited \u201cWomen Make Film\u201d with illuminating \u201cmasterpieces that need to be seen by anyone who wants to understand the art of filmmaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cCinema is even better than we think,\u201d Cousins says. \u201cThis medium that we love, it\u2019s even richer than we know.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The length of Mark Cousin's 14-hour documentary \"Women Make Film\" is itself a statement.
