The footage was uploaded within months to a website called GirlsDoPorn, which has allegedly made $17 million by specializing in \u201camateur porn\u201d starring nervous first-timers. They also appeared on Porn Hub, one of the world\u2019s leading adult video sites. The women say they were horrified to find out their shoots were online; many were harassed or ostracized as a result. At least one was disowned by her family, according to the FBI.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe owners and two employees of GirlsDoPorn now face sex-trafficking charges in what federal investigators call a \u201cscheme to deceive and coerce young women to appear in sex videos.\u201d A criminal complaint filed last week in San Diego, where the company is based, alleges that some of the women were threatened with \u201clegal action or outing\u201d if they didn\u2019t perform, barred from leaving shoots or even sexually assaulted. They were often paid far less than the $5,000 or so that was initially offered.\n\n\u201cThe FBI is still in the process of identifying all the women recruited, filmed, coerced and defrauded by this conspiracy,\u201d the complaint says, \u201cas well as the proceeds made from these activities.\u201d\n\nWebsite owner Matthew Isaac Wolfe, 37, porn actor Ruben Andre Garcia, 31, and employee Valorie Moser, 37, were arrested last week. The FBI says 37-year-old Michael James Pratt, the site\u2019s other owner, is a fugitive. He\u2019s believed to have fled the United States for New Zealand, where he and Wolfe grew up and were childhood friends. All could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAttorneys for Garcia and Pratt either declined to comment or did not respond to inquiries from The Washington Post. Anthony Colombo Jr., who represents Moser, said in an email that his client \u201clooks forward to addressing the charge in the future.\u201d\n\nThe allegations stunned others involved in the pornography industry, who described the company as an outlier. Alec Helmy, the president and publisher of XBiz, an adult-entertainment industry news site, called the case \u201ca very strange story.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsent is a huge thing within the business for obvious reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are a set of standard practices that everyone kind of abides by, and so it\u2019s rather shocking to think that a seemingly full-fledged business was operating that way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe criminal charges come as a civil trial against GirlsDoPorn and its owners is underway in San Diego Superior Court. The allegations in that case echo the criminal complaint: Women say that after responding to modeling ads, they were ultimately tricked into performing in pornography that was posted online.\n\nAD\n\nIn court, a woman identified only as Jane Doe 15 testified that her video spread quickly among her friends, family and classmates, according to the Daily Beast, which has reported extensively on the case. She was kicked off her cheerleading team and left her college town. She struggled in her relationships with family and friends.\n\n\u201cIf I had known that not only was it going on the Internet,\u201d she said, \u201cbut that they were posting it on the Internet, that my name would be attached to it, that it would be in the United States, and that I wouldn\u2019t be paid $5,000, but $2,000 less, and insulted because I was pale and bruised; if I had known that it was more than 30 minutes of filming, if I had known any of that, just any one of those; if I had known that other girls had been harassed and kicked out of school for it, if I had known that I would be kicked off the cheer team; if I had known any of that, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere are 22 plaintiffs in the civil case. John O\u2019Brien, one of the attorneys representing the women, told The Washington Post that their lives have been \u201ctotally turned upside down.\u201d He added: \u201cMany of these women have gotten psychiatric help and counselors. Quite a few of them have attempted suicide. \u2026 A lot of these girls have said their lives are ruined.\"\n\nAD\n\nPratt and others involved with GirlsDoPorn deny wrongdoing. They argue the women knew what they were getting into and signed contracts allowing the videos\u2019 online distribution, with Pratt attorney Aaron Sadock saying in opening statements that the women \u201cknew the risks.\"\n\n\u201cThe plaintiffs in their testimony show that they are aware of the inherent risks,\u201d he said, according to the Daily Beast. \u201cThey were aware of Paris Hilton, Kardashians, release of sex tapes. In other words, the plaintiffs\u2019 social-media presence, activities online, posting videos themselves make it clear that they inherently knew the risks of being filmed in an adult video.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut the FBI complaint claims the women were not given a chance to read the contracts or allowed to keep a copy, instead rushed into painful sexual encounters with an \u201caggressive and indifferent\u201d Garcia. Some allegedly signed after company employees gave them alcohol or marijuana.\n\nAD\n\nThe company also paid Moser and other women to falsely claim that they themselves had filmed videos that no one ever found out about, the FBI alleges. In one alleged example, a woman going by the name of \u201cKailyn\u201d wrote to a hesitant woman, \u201cYou\u2019re totally fine! That\u2019s what I was worried about but there is absolutely no way anyone will find out!\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien said that GirlsDoPorn, which he described as the \u201cblack sheep of the porn industry,\u201d built a business model and a customer base that relied on duping inexperienced young women into shooting sex scenes. The website often emphasizes the youth or inexperience of the women, sometimes noting that they \u201ctook months of convincing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want porn stars,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say their target is the girl next door, the one and only time she\u2019s ever going to do porn. And the only way to convince somebody of that \u2014 to get a college girl that has no interest in porn, has never done porn to do that \u2014 is to set up the scheme they have.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Investigators say some of the women were threatened with \u201clegal action or outing\u201d if they didn\u2019t perform, barred from leaving shoots or even sexually assaulted.", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4mX3sfuV7ZK6NqO1y4JgNekUVF4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UAHYKIHPSMI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
