REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/File Photo\n\nThe airline, part of the International Airlines Group (IAG), canceled 1,700 flights to and from London\u2019s Heathrow and Gatwick airports on Monday and Tuesday ahead of action by British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) members in BA\u2019s first ever pilot strike.\n\n\u201cI am really sorry that the cynical actions of the pilots\u2019 union have put us in his position,\u201d BA Chief Executive Alex Cruz told BBC television.\n\n\u201cIt is by all accounts an own goal; it\u2019s going to punish customers, it\u2019s going to punish our brand, it\u2019s going to punish the rest of the colleagues.\u201d\n\nIAG shares were down more than 2% in early trading.\n\nBA has offered its pilots an 11.5% pay rise over three years, which it said would take the pay of its highest earning captains from 167,000 pounds ($205,000), plus 16,000 pounds in allowances, to just over 200,000 pounds.\n\nIts pilots on average earn around 90,000 pounds a year.\n\nBALPA wants the pay deal to include profit sharing.\n\n\u201cBritish Airways is going through some good times, we want to share in those profits just as we shared the pain in the bad times,\u201d BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton told BBC television.\n\nHe had said pilots were willing to compromise, but BA was not prepared to \u201cbudge\u201d.\n\nThe airline dismissed a new offer by BALPA last week as an \u201celeventh hour inflated proposal\u201d that was not made in good faith. BALPA had said it would have called off the strikes this week if BA had engaged with the offer.\n\nBA\u2019s Cruz said 11.5% was \u201cway above\u201d inflation and the offer already recognized that BA was making money. UK inflation stood at 2.1% in July.\n\nCruz said the airline was prepared to negotiate.\n\n\u201cThe commitment of everyone at British Airways is to get over this particular dispute as quickly as possible and we urge the union to sit down with us as quickly as we can so we can reach an agreement,\u201d he told BBC radio.\n\nHe said it was a BA dispute and it would be resolved by the carrier rather than IAG.\n\nThe airline said it had no detail from BALPA on which pilots would strike, and had no way of predicting how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly, so had no option but to cancel nearly 100% of its flights.\n\nFollowing strikes on Monday and Tuesday, another day of industrial action is scheduled for Sept. 27.\n\nBA has been criticized over its communications with passengers ahead of the strike, which has caused thousands of people to change their travel plans.\n\nThe UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is investigating the airline after it enraged some travelers by wrongly telling them their flights had been canceled.\n\nThe regulator also reminded the airline to tell customers their rights. During the strikes, BA must offer passengers reimbursement for canceled flights, alternate travel arrangements under comparable conditions or a new flight at a later date.\n\nA spokeswoman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged both sides to end the dispute.", "description": "British Airways (BA) pilots began a two-day strike on Monday, grounding nearly all of its flights and disrupting thousands of passengers in a dispute over pay.", "authors": ["Paul Sandle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427753624&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF88001", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
