The invasion stemmed from Trump\u2019s decision, after a call with Turkey\u2019s strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, to remove US troops from the region, leaving America\u2019s Kurdish allies exposed. In a rare moment of consensus in Washington, the decision was roundly condemned by \u201cRepublicans, Democrats, Fox News,\u201d said Noah. \u201cEven the Joker was like, \u2018All right, I love chaos, but this shit is insane.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) From the Ukraine scandal to Syria, Trump\u2019s presidency continues to be more chaotic than a Black Friday sale at Fyre Festival. pic.twitter.com/vMHM313wnw\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is the only person who could find a way to make the Middle East more chaotic,\u201d summarized Noah. \u201cTurkey invading, Kurds fleeing, Isis escaping? The Middle East was already a geopolitical Jenga tower with everyone trying to figure out the right move, and then Donald Trump comes in and he\u2019s like: \u2018What if we move the whole table?\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump has justified his decision as part of a larger plan to bring US troops home. \u201cAnd that makes sense,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t make sense is that home seems to be another country in the Middle East.\u201d Noah referred to Trump\u2019s recent announcement that he\u2019s sending 2,800 troops \u201cand other stuff\u201d to Saudi Arabia in exchange for money.\n\nTrevor Noah: 'Not helping in a war is one area President Bone Spurs has experience with' Read more\n\nThe pay-for-military move is \u201ca first,\u201d said Noah. \u201cI don\u2019t think America has ever rented out its military before.\u201d Plus there\u2019s the \u201cother things\u201d bit, leaving Noah to wonder: \u201cDoes he, like, sneak Eric into the shipment?\u201d\n\nFor answers, Noah turned to the Daily Show\u2019s \u201csenior correspondent\u201d Desi Lydic in a bit of faux reporting on America\u2019s hypocrisy in the Middle East. \u201cPresident Trump is just fulfilling his promise to pull US troops out of the Middle East,\u201d she told Noah. \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing. A lot of men say they\u2019ll pull out, but they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nJohn Oliver on Trump\u2019s weather agency pick: \u2018Allow me to make a forecast \u2013 bullshit\u2019 Read more\n\nNoah wondered if that was making the region more of a \u201cshitshow,\u201d to which she responded: \u201cThe Middle East has always been a shitshow. It\u2019s like a Waffle House after 1am. It\u2019s not America\u2019s job to get involved.\u201d It\u2019s a nuanced situation \u2013 \u201cnot something America can solve\u201d.\n\nBut moving troops to Saudi Arabia? \u201cIt\u2019s the Middle East! It\u2019s America\u2019s job to get involved!\u201d Lydic said. \u201cIt has so much potential \u2013 it\u2019s like a Waffle House at 8am.\u201d The country presents a \u201cnuanced, complicated situation that only America can solve\u201d.\n\nBy moving troops into Saudi Arabia, Trump has \u201canother opportunity to pull America\u2019s troops out of the Middle East,\u201d Lydic concluded. \u201cBecause you can\u2019t pull them out if don\u2019t keep thrusting them back in.\u201d\n\nJimmy Kimmel: \u2018Melting like a creamsicle in July\u2019\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: the president is melting down like a creamsicle in July,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel, referring to the president\u2019s threat of suing House intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff and House majority leader Nancy Pelosi over their impeachment inquiry. \u201cWhich you can\u2019t do,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cAnd not only that \u2013 who\u2019s he going to get to sue them? All his lawyers are either in jail or going there soon.\u201d\n\nTrump has even been feuding with Fox News about what he called unfair coverage. It\u2019s especially notable since Fox anchor Shephard Smith announced his surprise departure from the network on Friday. Smith was \u201cone of the only reasons they could use the word \u2018news\u2019 after Fox with a straight face,\u201d said Kimmel, \u201cand now he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has been shilling for votes for former press secretary Sean Spicer on Dancing with the Stars, tweeting: \u201cVote for good guy Sean Spicer tonight on Dancing with the Stars. He has always been there for us!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that might be his greatest abuse of power yet,\u201d joked Kimmel.", "description": "Late-night hosts discussed chaos at home and abroad, as Trump hits out on impeachment and Turkey invades northern Syria", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eb7c700aafbf6b0001404ab583bdf3681663083/71_0_1445_867/master/1445.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9c12bdb5b765077c267905026afe0e0c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
