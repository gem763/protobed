As Lorenzo Reyes details, the league's elite class is starting to crystalize. USA TODAY\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. \u2060\u2014 The New England Patriots\u2019 core defensive players spent the bulk of the 2018 season in this somewhat awkward stage, stuck between experimentation, modification and refinement. During that time, they found the ideal performance most elusive.\n\nThey made plays and helped earn victories, but the defense also gave up too many yards, too many big plays, and at times missed opportunities for defining contributions.\n\nThe system that they were running offered numerous options intended to give players flexibility within the schemes. But that freedom also heightened the need for strong cohesion, communication and trust among the Patriots\u2019 defenders so the unit could operate like a well-oiled machine. And for much of the year, they just didn\u2019t have it all.\n\nWeeks of ups and downs, trial and error, additional film study and endless discussions unfolded, and then, finally, as the 2018 season neared its end, everything seemingly fell into place.\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 8 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nOpponents\u2019 yardage and point totals decreased. The Patriots\u2019 takeaways increased. And during that five-week run that started in Week 16 and extended to their Super Bowl victory over the Los Angeles Rams, New England\u2019s defensive players were at their best.\n\nFast. Aggressive. Instinctive. Disruptive. Opportunistic.\n\n\u201cWe finally found out how we needed to play the last two (regular season games) and the last three postseason games,\u201d safety Duron Harmon told USA TODAY Sports Sunday night in front of his locker. \u201cWe found out how we wanted to play, came back (this year) and had something to build off of.\u201d\n\nAnd build they have. What was already a good defense during that march to the Super Bowl is now even better \u2014 on pace to post a historically great season. The unit is even more disruptive and impactful, and it has served as the backbone of the team during this quest to return to the Super Bowl.\n\nSunday evening against the visiting Cleveland Browns, New England\u2019s defense used a three-takeaway first quarter to set the tone for a 27-13 victory that improved New England\u2019s record to 8-0. During that performance, the Patriots never let Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield find his comfort zone, and they made his Pro Bowl wide receiver tandem of Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry look very average. The group limited the Browns to just 310 yards and only a 25% success rate (3 of 12) on third downs.\n\nFor the sixth time this season, the Patriots held an opponent to fewer than 14 points, and the defense scored its fourth touchdown of the year (a fumble recovered and returned by Dont\u2019a Hightower), matching its total of touchdowns allowed. With 25 takeaways through eight games, they\u2019re just three shy of tying last season\u2019s total for the entire year.\n\nTo say the Patriots have taken things to another level would represent an understatement.\n\n\u201cYeeeeeeah,\u201d Harmon agreed with a smile before almost downplaying things in a way that would make Bill Belichick proud. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of guys coming back this year, and then you add a guy like [linebacker] Jamie Collins, and when you\u2019re able to score the ball on defense, that does something big for the team.\u201d\n\nThat continuity ranks among the biggest factors in the Patriots\u2019 continued elevation on defense.\n\nOutside of Collins, who spent three and a half years with New England before a 2016 midseason trade to Cleveland and then re-signed with the Patriots this offseason, all of the starters (and most of the key contributors) have now played together in consecutive seasons.\n\nThat enables the Patriots defensive players to operate almost effortlessly in the freedoms of their system. Each player understands his role and that of the next guy, and how they all work together. That helps them cut down on miscommunications and mental errors while also positioning them for dominant play.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mindset. It\u2019s a little bit of everything,\u201d cornerback Stephon Gilmore said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of smart and instinctive players and we play fast and trust each other. But it\u2019s also really great coaches preparing us.\u201d\n\nBelichick has designed the system. But because all 11 players operate with such cohesion and understanding, he feels comfortable taking a step back and letting them run the show on the field.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201chis ability to give ownership to the players,\u201d defensive back Devin McCourty said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of times for us as defenders, we go out there and (Belichick will) tell us like, \u2018Hey, you\u2019ve got five different options right here. Whatever you see best, by formation, by personnel, make the call.\u2019 and he\u2019s told, whether it\u2019s myself, (Harmon), Pat (Chung), who really makes a lot of calls, Hightower, (Collins), (Ja\u2019Whaun Bentley) or (Elandon Roberts) \u2014 he tells us all as signal-callers, \u2018Nine out of 10 times, I trust you\u2019re going to make the right decision. So, I don\u2019t want to tell you what to do and ruin the game.\u2019\n\n\"As he always says, \u2018Coaches mess up games more than anything,\u2019 and I think him allowing us to do that, for one, it makes us want to study and understand the game, take accountability to our coaches, to our teammates. And then I think two, it allows us to just play free \u2014 go out there, study the game and do what you think is necessary. \u2026 That\u2019s why you see us playing so fast as a defense right now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s remarkable that Belichick \u2014 one of the greatest coaches and strategic minds of all time \u2014 would take a hands-off approach to the defense in games. He famously has a reputation of running a tight ship. But because he preaches the importance of preparation and accountability during the week, he knows the leaders of his defense will not let him down, and that they\u2019ll ensure all of their teammates are on the same page and primed for success as well.\n\nIn many ways, the Patriots\u2019 dominance on has saved the team as a whole this season.\n\nTrue, Tom Brady remains Tom Brady. And Julian Edelman remains his favorite target. But the Patriots\u2019 offense has yet to completely find its identity this season. New England\u2019s offensive line also is working for cohesion while waiting for left tackle Isaiah Wynn to get healthy. And players and coaches also are still very much trying to find what other play-makers will emerge to help fill the void that was left when Rob Gronkowski retired this offseason.\n\nEventually, tight end Benjamin Watson could claim a key role, and it\u2019s expected that newly acquired wide receiver Mohamed Sanu will as well.\n\nBut for now, the Patriots are still tinkering until they find the right combinations before hitting the final stretch of the regular season in prime form. They can do so without an ounce of panic because they know their dominant defense is helping to pick up the slack, and in some cases carrying them.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say carry,\u201d Harmon protested with a laugh. \u201cWe aid them. We help them and they help us. It\u2019s complimentary football.\n\n\u201cToday was a day we played off each other,\u201d Harmon added. But in truth, Sunday was another day in which the defense paved the way for success.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports\u2019 Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones and listen to the Football Jones podcast on iTunes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
