She was speaking to her Gringo co-star, David Oyelowo at the annual fundraiser for Nigerian children\u2019s educational and health program GEANCO, reports Variety.\n\n\"I obviously am a white person who benefited from my white privilege. I grew up during the apartheid era, I benefited from it. These children [today] were all born post-apartheid era. I feel like it\u2019s my duty to not let them forget and to also let them know that there is [unity], that I am with them, that we are all standing together,\" she said.\n\nThe Benoni-born star added how heartwarming it is for her to be recognised by her fellow South Africans when she visits even the poorest of villages. \"A lot of the places where we support grassroots organisations \u2013 who are the highest affected when it comes to AIDS and HIV in South Africa \u2013 are, I think it\u2019s a no-brainer, very rural communities. A lot of those kids do not know who I am.\n\n\"Strangely, they always know that I am South African. And that\u2019s heaven. It\u2019s amazing to be around your sisters and to have that be the thing they know about you. It\u2019s always moved me so much when they run up to me and say, 'Hey, Sisi!',\" she recalled.\n\nWhile Charlize benefited from apartheid due to the colour of her skin, she\u2019s never hidden how traumatic her childhood was. She grew up with an alcoholic and abusive father.\n\nEventually her mom killed her husband in self-defence after he threatened her with a gun. When he started shooting, she grabbed her own gun and shot back, killing him and wounding his brother, who was also at their home at the time, Business Insider reported. Police later determined she shot him in self-defence.\n\n\"I survived that, and I\u2019m proud of that,\" Charlize told The New York Times. \"I\u2019ve worked hard for that, too. And I am not scared of that. I am not fearful of the darkness. If anything, I am intrigued by it because I think it explains human nature and people better.\"", "description": "Charlize Theron recently spoke about growing up during apartheid in South Africa and how, as a white person, she benefited from the system.", "authors": ["Nkosazana Ngwadla"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9005/def032ca640b4dfbae05ae753da1b3a2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
