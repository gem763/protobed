Three analysts have a hold rating while two have sell ratings. The average price target among the ten analysts tracked by Bloomberg is $28.32, below the current $30 share price.", "description": "The analyst community have labelled a report that Wisetech is inflating its revenue as \"nonsense\" deriding short sellers for failing to understand the \"beauty\" of the $10 billion logistics company's acquisition led model.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_412%2C$y_688/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/81252f64e73fcafe52576bbd8a954aeabf53dd2b", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
