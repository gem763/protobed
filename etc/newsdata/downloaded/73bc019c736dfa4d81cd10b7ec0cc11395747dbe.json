During this period, the league programme would be in full swing until the next Fifa window from November 11 to 19.\n\nThis week, SuperSport United was reluctant to release its players for the Under-23s\u2019 trip to Egypt, where they played a friendly against the north Africans on Friday.\n\nUnited\u2019s trio of Teboho Mokoena, Sipho Mbule and Jamie Webber form an integral part of coach Kaitano Tembo\u2019s team, but are also key members of the Olympic team.\n\nThe same applies to Under-23 captain Tercious Malepe, who is a regular at Chippa United, while the likes of Portugal-based duo Kobamelo Kodisang and Luther Singh have also just made a breakthrough at their respective clubs overseas.\n\nSafa would also have to engage overseas clubs to release the likes of Singh, Lyle Foster, Kodisang and Thabo Cele.\n\nThe tournament in Egypt will determine Africa\u2019s three representatives at the 2020 Olympics.\n\nSouth Africa will face Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Zambia in Group B, while hosts Egypt have Mali, Ghana and Cameroon in the other pool.\n\nNotoane\u2019s charges will open their campaign against regional rivals Zambia on November 9. They will meet Nigeria three days later and close off with the Ivorians on November 15.\n\nIt remains to be seen how soon the two organisations will reach an agreement, given their shaky relationship.\n\nSafa\u2019s request has come in the midst of the PSL objecting to match officials\u2019 OUTsurance sponsorship, which the league argues conflicts with the rights of some of its main sponsors.", "description": "Safa asks the NSL to move PSL fixtures so that players can compete in the CAF Afcon in Egypt.", "authors": ["Timothy Molobi", "Daniel Mothowagae"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9331/a066818d08a843268e60e3d085f799c3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
