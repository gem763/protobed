Steelers safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, acquired in a trade with Miami last month, picked off Dolphins quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick twice, and Pittsburgh forced four turnovers in all to avoid an embarrassing loss that would have effectively ended the competitive portion of its season.\n\nRudolph completed 20 of 36 passes, including a 45-yard touchdown to rookie Diontae Johnson late in the second quarter and a 26-yard strike to JuJu Smith-Schuster in the third quarter that put the Steelers in control. Smith-Schuster caught five passes for 103 yards, his first 100-yard game of the year.\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick passed for 190 yards with two touchdowns and two picks, but a rare hot start couldn\u2019t prevent Miami from staying winless through seven games for the first time since 2011. The Dolphins have dropped 10 straight dating back to last season.\n\nRudolph stressed he wasn\u2019t worried about the long-term effects of a frightening concussion he suffered against Baltimore on 6 October, when he was knocked unconscious from a helmet-to-helmet hit by Ravens safety Earl Thomas. Still, playing for the first time in three weeks, he looked shaky at best and completely out of sorts at worst during an ugly opening quarter that saw the Dolphins grab their first two-touchdown lead over any opponent in more than a year.\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s first possession ended with Rudolph throwing a pick to Xavien Howard \u2013 back in the lineup after missing two games with a knee injury \u2013 and its second ended with an ugly fourth-down misfire by Rudolph.\n\nThe Dolphins, in the midst of a massive and ceaseless roster overhaul under first-year coach Brian Flores that included trading running back Kenyan Drake to Arizona on Monday for a conditional sixth-round pick in next year\u2019s draft, showed their first extended signs of life in an already lost season.\n\nFitzpatrick found Albert Wilson for a five-yard touchdown after Howard\u2019s interception, and Allen Hurns plowed through several tackles on his way to a 12-yard score that gave Miami \u2013 a 14-point underdog \u2013 a 14-point advantage for the first time since 7 October 2018. The Dolphins couldn\u2019t hold on then, allowing the Bengals to rally for a victory. A year later, not much has changed.\n\nThe Steelers pulled within 14-10 at the break thanks to the first of Minkah Fitzpatrick\u2019s two interceptions and some curious defensive play-calling by the Dolphins.\n\nLeading by 11 points and with Pittsburgh facing third-and-20 outside of field goal range, Miami opted to blitz and didn\u2019t bother to guard Johnson, who took a short pass from Rudolph and used a couple of downfield blocks by James Washington to weave his way 45 yards to the end zone.\n\nFitzpatrick\u2019s second pick \u2013 basically an arm punt by Ryan Fitzpatrick \u2013 gave the Steelers the ball at Pittsburgh three. Rudolph then led Pittsburgh 97 yards in 12 plays, the last 26 coming on a pretty lob to the end zone that Smith-Schuster hauled in to put the Steelers up 17-14. Pittsburgh stopped Fitzpatrick on a fourth-down scramble on Miami\u2019s ensuing possession \u2013 a stop made possible by coach Mike Tomlin\u2019s first successful officiating challenge since 2017 \u2013 and five plays later, Conner bulled over from nine yards out to boost Pittsburgh\u2019s lead to 10.", "description": "James Conner ran for 145 yards and a touchdown and Mason Rudolph overcame a shaky start to throw for 251 yards as the Steelers pulled away for a 27-14 victory", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e21b2e6137cb102093665d2af13fdf633b9d89ae/0_86_3462_2078/master/3462.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f987d2218c09b00177e4ace97be5f301", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
