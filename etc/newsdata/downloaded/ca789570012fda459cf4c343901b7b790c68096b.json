When I was growing up in Somaliland, I saw how money sent back home by migrants could transform the lives of individuals and entire communities.\n\n\u201cWhen I came to London to study and started to send money back home, I was frustrated by the inconvenience and cost of transferring money through traditional agents.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"I was determined to find a better way and I set up WorldRemit in 2010 with the mission of making it easier and faster for migrants to send money home.\n\n\u201cToday World Remit is one of the most global Fintech firms and has attracted diverse and talented teams in London and around the world. This honour is a testament to their hard work and passion for the company\u2019s mission.\"\n\nPowerlist publisher Michael Eboda said: \u201cThe Powerlist is delighted to celebrate these 100 amazing people.\n\n\" Ismail is a true pioneer whose company is shaking up the remittance industry and positively impacting the lives of people around the world.\n\n\"His story is incredibly powerful and an inspiration to us all.\u201d\n\nAnd making up the rest of the Top 100:\n\n1.
