It was his sixth multi-homer game of the season, 14th of his career and the 20th leadoff shot of his career. Both came off Dinelson Lamet (3-6). Pederson added a sacrifice fly in the ninth.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s taking good at-bats and it showed tonight,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cHe\u2019s been consistent in the strike zone, taking good, quality at-bats.\u201d\n\nRios\u2019 shot off rookie David Bednar (0-1) was estimated at 473 feet, the second-longest in Petco Park history. The longest was a 479-footer by San Diego\u2019s Alex Dickerson on Sept. 9, 2016. It was Rios\u2019 fourth.\n\nPederson homered leading off the fifth to give Dodgers a 4-3 lead, but the Padres tied it in the sixth when Yimi Garcia hit a batter and allowed consecutive singles, including an RBI base hit by Greg Garcia.\n\nThe Dodgers regained the lead when Rios homered deep into the seats in right field leading off the seventh. It was his fourth.\n\nDylan Floro (5-3) got the last out of the sixth for the win. Kenley Jansen pitched the ninth for his 32nd save.\n\nJansen already was the Dodgers\u2018 all-time leader in saves before recording his 300th.\n\n\u201cReally proud of him. That\u2019s a big number,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cLongevity helps, health, performance, all those things. Hats off to Kenley and his teammates that have gotten him to that position. We acknowledged that in the clubhouse afterward. He got his hair done so I don\u2019t know if we were going to do a beer shower.\u201d\n\nSaid Jansen: \u201cTo me what it means most is getting myself ready to get better and get to the playoffs and try to help my team win a championship. Definitely it\u2019s a blessing to get 300 saves. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nThe Dodgers took a 2-0 lead in the first on Pederson\u2019s homer and Corey Seager\u2019s two-out RBI double.\n\nSan Diego went ahead 3-2 in the bottom of the inning. Ross Stripling issued a leadoff walk to Greg Garcia and then struck out Manuel Margot and Eric Hosmer, but then ran into trouble. He allowed Wil Myers\u2019 single and Francisco Mejia\u2019s RBI double, with Myers scoring on Pederson\u2019s throwing error. Rookie Josh Naylor followed with an RBI single.\n\nTaylor homered leading off the second, his 12th.\n\nStripling went three innings, allowing three runs and four hits while striking out seven and walking one.\n\nLamet struck out 10 in five innings while allowing four runs and six hits, with two walks.\n\n\u201cHe was a little slow getting going,\u201d interim manager Rod Barajas said. \u201cKind of a theme, something he needs to be better at. He had lights-out stuff again. Ten punches in five innings, that\u2019s 24 punches in the last 11 innings. He\u2019s got electric stuff, great stuff. When you\u2019re playing a team like the Dodgers, when you make mistakes, they don\u2019t miss a whole lot of those. Still sharp, still has his stuff.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nDodgers: SS Seager left the game in the bottom of the third inning with a tight left hamstring. He was replaced by Kik\u00e9 Hernandez. Roberts said Seager will take Thursday off and then return Friday night.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (15-5, 3.15 ERA) is scheduled to make his final start of the regular season in the series finale Thursday. He\u2019s 2-0 with a 3.12 ERA in four starts against San Diego this season.\n\nPadres: LHP Joey Lucchesi (10-9, 4.28) is scheduled to start the Padres\u2018 home finale. It will be his team-leading 30th start, and his 10 victories are the most by a Padres starter since Jhoulys Chacin\u2019s 13 in 2017.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Joc Pederson opened the game with his franchise single-season record ninth leadoff home run and Kenley Jansen closed it with his 300th career save.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/dodgers_padres_baseball_68427_c0-125-3005-1877_s1770x1032.jpg?5c89961d250ff8aafc09a00a9ce56ea106a35e3d", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
