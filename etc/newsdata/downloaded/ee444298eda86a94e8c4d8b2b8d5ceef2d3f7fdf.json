'No, I was in Avengers. What?'\n\nFavreau replied: 'Remember, Spider-Man at the end, and Tom Holland's there and you're going to walk out and do a press conference? I give you the ring?'\n\nOnce it hit her, she exclaimed, 'Oh yes! That was Spider-Man? Oh my god!'\n\nWoah! The Seven star, 47, had a brief cameo role (pictured above) in the 2017 film and has also starred as Pepper Potts in six other Marvel films\n\nBut now the star explained she was 'confused' by the number of Marvel films she had been in.\n\nShe has starred in all three Iron Man films, as well as The Avengers, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.\n\nGwyneth told Elle magazine: 'I never read stuff. But it is confusing because there are so many Marvel movies, and to be honest, I haven't seen very many of them.'\n\n'I thought that it was an Avengers movie': Gwyneth Paltrow explained why she forgot about appearing in Spider-Man: Homecoming\n\n'It\u2019s really stupid and I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m a 47-year-old mother,' she added.\n\nGwyneth has two children, Apple and Moses, with her ex-husband Chris Martin, the front man of Coldplay.\n\nThe couple divorced in 2016 and the Iron Man star re-married in 2018 when she tied the knot with director Brad Falchuk.\n\nThe saga continued during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live last week the star said the gaffe was 'so embarrassing' when Kimmel brought it up.\n\n'I just got confused!' she insisted. 'There's so many of these wonderful Marvel interconnecting movies, and I thought that it was an Avengers movie, but it was not.'\n\nDon't remind her! Paltrow buried her face in her hands as Jimmy asked her about the awkward moment\n\n'Was Spider-Man himself offended by this?' Jimmy asked, referring to Tom Holland.\n\nEmbarrassingly, Gwyneth once again admitted she had never even seen the movie.\n\n'I never actually saw the movie,' she said, before backtracking. 'I mean wait, cut that out!'\n\nIt comes after the Goop founder joined Paris Jackson at the amFAR Gala in Los Angeles.\n\nMeet n greet: The Goop founder recently joined Paris Jackson at the amFAR Gala in Los Angeles\n\nBoth wore long gowns as they took their time on the purple carpet saying hello and posing side-by-side.
