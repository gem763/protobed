The workers review the clips in order to help the system distinguish pet from threat - benign movement from malignant intruder. The only problem? Cloud Cam users have no idea they\u2019re being watched by human eyes.\n\nAlso on rt.com Show me your face: Google Nest Hub surveillance system lets you bring Big Brother home with you\n\nThe Cloud Cam\u2019s terms and conditions say nothing about humans watching footage from their security cameras, and an Amazon representative insisted that the only clips reviewed by employees are submitted voluntarily, for \u201ctroubleshooting\u201d purposes. Other than that, \u201conly customers can view their clips,\u201d the spokeswoman told Bloomberg, insisting Amazon \u201ctake[s] privacy seriously.\u201d\n\nBut there were no \u201cobvious technical glitches\u201d that would indicate the clips were selected for troubleshooting, and some included obviously private content - specifically, couples having sex - that customers were unlikely to want shared, two of the employee whistleblowers claimed. The auditors typically watch and annotate about 150 20-30 second clips a day.\n\nAmazon acknowledged that clips containing \u201cinappropriate content\u201d are flagged and discarded so they are not used in training the AI, but avoided explaining how the inappropriate content would have ended up in front of the trainers in the first place if - as the spokeswoman claimed - all clip submissions were voluntary.\n\nWhile the company has tried to keep a lid on the program, barring employees from using their phones on the floor where Cloud Cam clips are audited, some of the juicier footage has leaked out, one source claimed.\n\nAlso on rt.com 'Alexa, who's eavesdropping on me?' 1000s of humans reportedly audit 'snippets' from Amazon devices\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Amazon has been caught secretly using humans to \u201chelp\u201d its AI devices along. Earlier this year, it emerged that thousands of Amazon employees and contractors were listening to audio snippets from the company\u2019s \u201csmart\u201d speaker, Alexa, unbeknownst to customers. The company was forced to update its privacy policies with a disclaimer and streamline the process for deleting recordings, which pacified some customers, until it came out a few months later that even deleting a recording didn\u2019t necessarily remove it from Amazon\u2019s servers. The company now offers Alexa users the option of excluding their recordings from human review.\n\nLike this story?
