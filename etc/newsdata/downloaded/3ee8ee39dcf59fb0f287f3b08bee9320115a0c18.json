It's not really as hard as airborne pandemics, like pandemic flu, which killed close to 100 million in 1917-1918.\"\n\nEven today, he said, the world is not ready for pandemic flu. \"We are very vulnerable\", Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\n\n\"Countries with weak health systems impact the whole world\", he added. \"We are only as strong as the weakest link.
