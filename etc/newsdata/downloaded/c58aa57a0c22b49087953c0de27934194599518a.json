The suit also accuses Comcast, which also owns NBC Universal, of refusing to carry OANN because it \u201ccounters the liberal politics of its own channel, MSNBC.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Daily Caller, the July attack by Ms. Maddow was prompted by a Daily Beast article stating that OANN on-air reporter Kristian Rouz is a \u201cRussian national on the payroll of the Kremlin\u2019s official propaganda outlet, Sputnik.\u201d\n\nBased on that, Ms. Maddow told her audience that OANN, which President Trump often praises as even better than Fox News Channel, \u201creally literally is paid Russian propaganda.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to the site Law and Crime, Skip Miller, attorney for OANN, called the remarks \u201cfalse and malicious.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne America is wholly owned, operated and financed by the Herring family in San Diego,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are as American as apple pie. They are not paid by Russia and have nothing to do with the Russian government. This is a false and malicious libel, and they\u2019re going to answer for it in a court of law.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
