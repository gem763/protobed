Ignore the bizarre name and the adventurous in-name punctuation (the trio of /s are to replicate the three slashes ahead of the M in BMW's M logo), and instead focus on its subtle, M-tastic upgrades.\n\nWe've poked fun at BMW's overuse of M logos and badges in the past, but the automaker found a lower-key way of getting its branding across on this special-edition M4. (Okay, other than the slash-tastic ///M name.) The carbon-fiber roof, for example, includes a tri-color red, white, and blue M stripe\u2014that's applied directly into the carbon-fiber, under the clearcoat layer. The treatment is echoed in the red, white, and blue M colors woven into the interior's carbon-fiber trim, another ///M Heritage exclusive.\n\nOnly three color combinations are offered\u2014each paint color is tied to a specific interior color\u2014and include Imola Red II (with black and red leather with red stitching), Laguna Seca Blue (with silver and black leather with turquoise stitching), and Velvet Blue (with silver and black leather with blue stitching). The M4's Competition package is standard, including its unique M Adaptive suspension setup and stout 444-hp tune for the turbocharged inline-six. BMW throws in 20-inch Orbit Grey wheels as well as Edition ///M Heritage door sill plates with \"1/750\" emblazoned on them.\n\nThat's right\u2014only 750 of these special M4s will be built, with deliveries starting at the end of this year. We should point out that the choice between the six-speed manual transmission and the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic is yours\u2014but given the on-again, off-again signs out of Munich that the next generation of M cars might lose their manual-transmission options, you know which one we'd go with.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "A new M4 arrives soon, but first this special edition says goodbye to the current version.", "authors": ["Alexander Stoklosa"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/19MhKqG8C._4O_z46MEpgw--~B/aD03MjU7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/898e44b36a576cbf31dfb5705cfa7038"}
