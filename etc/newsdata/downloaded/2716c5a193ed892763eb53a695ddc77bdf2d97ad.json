They were all perfect. Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump also said he could be persuaded to release more information about an earlier conversation he had with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, while repeating that he did nothing inappropriate in his contacts with the foreign leader.\n\n\u201cThe word is they\u2019re going to ask for the first phone conversation,\u201d Trump said at the news conference. \u201cYou can have it anytime you need it. And also Mike Pence\u2019s conversations, which were, I think, one or two of them. They were perfect. They were all perfect.\u201d\n\nThe comments came hours after the White House released a memo detailing Trump\u2019s July 25 conversation with Zelensky in which Trump pressured him to open an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son. The document confirmed allegations that the president sought help from a foreign leader to investigate a political rival \u2014 allegations that convinced House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to formally launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nDuring the news conference, Trump revealed that the July 25 conversation was the second phone call between the two leaders and said he would release the first if prompted.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s top aides have also been drawn into the scandal. The Washington Post reported that Trump asked his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine just days before the July 25 call with Zelensky, and the memo of Trump\u2019s call showed the president urging Zelensky to work with Attorney General William Barr to investigate the Bidens.", "description": "The president also said he could be convinced to release more information on an earlier conversation with Ukraine's president.", "authors": ["Abbey Marshall"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/59/29/c1a995a84ac38acdbe41e757bcb5/190925-pence1-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
