We don't know what's going on, but we think it's true,\" Nam's older brother Vo Ngoc Chuyen said.\n\nIn Do Thanh, another village in the district, people attended a Sunday Mass to pray for the missing family members. Three families in Do Thanh have reported to local authorities that their missing family members could be among the victims.\n\nDuring the Mass, the priest, the Rev. Nguyen Duc Vinh, encouraged people to keep up their hopes until officials confirm the identities of the victims.\n\nU.K. police said Saturday that all 39 victims were out of the truck and in a mortuary awaiting autopsies. But they said the victims have not been identified and very few documents were found with the bodies.\n\nMeanwhile, British police released three people on bail Sunday after questioning them in the deaths.\n\nA 38-year-old man, a 38-year-old woman \u2014 both from the northern English town of Warrington \u2014 and a 46-year-old man from Northern Ireland were questioned on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people.\n\nEssex Police on Saturday charged the driver of the truck, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Northern Ireland, with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering. He is to appear in court Monday.\n\nIrish police said another man was arrested Saturday in connection with the case.\n\nBritish police said their investigation includes over 500 exhibits, including cellphones that have to be downloaded to help identify the victims.\n\n\"We are working hard to understand how the 39 victims of this tragic incident have died and to identify all those involved,\" said Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore. \"We remain open-minded as to nationalities of those who have died. We are asking anyone who may have information that may assist us in identification to come forward to us.\"\n\n___\n\nDinh reported from Hanoi, Vietnam.
