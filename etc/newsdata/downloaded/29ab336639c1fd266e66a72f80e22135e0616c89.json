In league with Rost, ADF has shepherded this case to the Supreme Court, hoping to create a legal right for employers to discriminate against workers for being trans.\n\n\n\nRost and his team also wholesale reject the reality of trans peoples\u2019 existence. In briefs filed ahead of oral arguments, it is obvious they do not recognize Stephens as a woman, even pointing out their refusal. \u201cStephens\u2019s counsel indicates it is proper to refer to Stephens as \u2018she\u2019 and \u2018a woman,\u2019\u201d they write in a footnote. But rather than maintain that accuracy, they continue, they \u201c[try] to avoid use of pronouns and sex-specific terms when referring to Stephens.\u201d\n\nRost and his discriminatory workplace rules also demonstrate that where there is anti-trans bias, there is sexism. Under oath, Rost admitted he explicitly reinforces gender roles in all his workers\u2019 appearance. Specifically, in the year 2017, he was still forbidding his female funeral directors from wearing pants. At that time, Rost had no female funeral directors\u2014though Stephens would have been one, were she not fired. As his counsel told a panel of judges at the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Rost believes that \u201csex is an immutable gift from God.\u201d\n\nWith his case at last before the country\u2019s highest court, Rost is portraying himself as a victim of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. \u201cNow, my family\u2019s livelihood and our legacy hang in the balance before the Supreme Court,\u201d Rost wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. But Rost and ADF were the ones to appeal to the Supreme Court after the Sixth Circuit affirmed Stephens\u2019 rights. They are the ones positioning Rost\u2019s funeral home as the next Masterpiece Cakeshop, the Supreme Court case ADF hoped would grant private businesses legal protections to refuse patrons based on sexual orientation.\n\nIn an ADF-produced video posted soon after the Supreme Court accepted Harris Funeral Homes, Stephens is never even named. Instead, she is referred to as \u201ca male employee\u201d who \u201capproached Tom\u201d and \u201cinsisted on dressing as a woman while working with grieving families.\u201d Rost appears with his wife, choking back tears. ADF identifies him as someone who was \u201cpunished for following the law,\u201d someone who is \u201ccaught up in this cultural windstorm\u201d without mentioning that they, in fact, whipped it up and elevated Rost to that role. In the National Review, Rost\u2019s ADF attorney explicitly linked their case to other trans-exclusionary cases across the country. They also claimed, borrowing a line from some trans-exclusionary feminists, that should Stephens prevail, \u201cequal opportunities and bodily privacy protections for women and girls will be lost.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt is ADF\u2019s client who has already denied Stephens equal opportunity. Still, like their use of the term \u201cbodily autonomy\u201d, they are selectively borrowing from feminists. With trans-exclusionary feminists\u2014those who believe there is a feminist basis for discrimination against transgender women\u2014they specifically share the false presumption that when trans women gain or protect their rights, cis women lose. To that end, Rost\u2019s side marshalled support from a small group called the Women\u2019s Liberation Front. Their brief in support of Rost flat out calls Stephens a man, claiming she \u201cwanted to wear a skirt\u201d to express a \u201cgender ideology,\u201d one which would \u201cerase\u201d women. They erase Stephens herself to make this claim.\n\nIt\u2019s been six years since Aimee Stephens faced the decision, would she sue her boss for discrimination? She consulted with her wife, she told me in late August, and her spouse supported her legal challenge. Stephens said she also already knew what she needed to do. \u201cIt was far too important,\u201d said Stephens, \u201cnot just for me, but for everybody like me.\u201d In three weeks, she will be at the Supreme Court, perhaps surrounded by some of those people like her, women and workers both.\n\n\n\nThe stakes in this case would be high under any administration, but they are now, with the two new justices appointed by President Trump, only more so. Reversing a Supreme Court decision is no small thing. Even if Democrats retake the White House after the 2020 election, and they regain majority control of the Senate, and they are given opportunity to appoint Supreme Court justices, Title VII cases don\u2019t come along very often. It could be years before another case arose that would allow for a challenge\u2014and it would first have to travel through lower courts now stacked with Trump appointees. It\u2019s also important to remember that it wasn\u2019t until the Obama administration that any president even said the word \u201ctransgender.\u201d There are still liberal pundits out there who claim trans rights are a \u201cboutique issue\u201d that cost Democrats the presidency.\n\nTo Stephens, there is nothing small about any of this, and not just because one of the cases is her own. \u201cThis decision has more far-reaching effects than anybody realizes at this point,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they rule and agree with Mr. Trump, then we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.\u201d These cases might radically redefine laws prohibiting discrimination based on sex for everyone in the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s going to affect people who once thought they were safe before. I think they\u2019re going to find out they aren\u2019t safe from anything anymore.\u201d", "description": "Three Supreme Court cases could redefine workplace rights for gay and trans people\u2014and for everyone else.", "authors": ["Melissa Gira Grant"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/bf9a11a491789d14b6000175da7901d12b4a22f9.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
