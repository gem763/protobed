He has got a good draw, he should run a really decent race.\n\n\u201cIt has been pretty straightforward for him in his career so far, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of pressure so this will be different.\n\n\u201cAfter his last win, he was quite tired so we gave him a big, long rest because there is no rush.\u201d\n\nWhile all of his wins have come up the 1,000m Sha Tin straight, So knows there will come a time when he has to race his four-year-old around the bend.\n\n\u201cI spoke to Zac, and we agreed that for now we would just put him in the 1,000m race,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe is a four-year-old now after racing well at three and it seems like he would handle the turn just fine.\n\n\u201cHe still has some bad habits, he throws his head to one side, so we will give him a couple of runs and then decide if we go further or not.\n\n\u201cWe cannot run him only over 1,000m in the future, but for this moment, it is better to keep him there to teach him some more and hopefully win some races.\u201d\n\nMr Croissant will line up in the Class Three Grand Seiko Excellent Handicap (1,200m) where he will carry the top weight of 133 pounds, also under Purton.\n\nThe four-year-old has obvious ability and has never missed a placing in his seven-start career but has struggled at times to put his rivals to the sword.\n\nHe will face the likes of Aerohappiness, Lone Eagle and Monica in the race as he looks to make his way to Class Two.", "description": "While Sunday will be headlined by Group One champion Beauty Generation looking to protect his 10-win streak, trainer Chris So Wai-yin faces his own pressure cooker moment at Sha Tin....", "authors": ["Trenton Akers", "Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/19/84f27462-f152-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_154114.JPG?itok=Lbq4ZTc0&v=1571470882", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
