It Failed Miserably", "language": "en", "text": "In February 1992, less than three months into his first stint as the federal government\u2019s top lawyer, Attorney General William Pelham Barr told a gathering of more than 100 law enforcement officials in San Diego that under his leadership, the U.S. Department of Justice would finally solve the looming immigration crisis at the border.\n\nBarr\u2019s proposed solution was, in its way, decades ahead of its time: the construction of a heavily armored steel fence along the U.S.-Mexico border immediately south of San Diego, complete with lighting, motion sensors, and the addition of hundreds of Border Patrol agents.\n\nThe fence was not \u201ca silver bullet,\u201d Barr admitted in his speech, but \u201ca steady march in the right direction\u201d to preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the country with impunity.\n\nUnfortunately for Barr, the fence was an epic failure.\n\nThough Barr saw the barrier as a novel way to stop undocumented immigrants from \u201ccrashing through the back door and the back window, violating our laws, flouting our sovereignty and ignoring our process,\u201d as he told law enforcement in that speech, border-crossers took little notice of the latest hurdle.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many people, horses, bicycles, helicopters or planes they use,\u201d one migrant told The Washington Post one week after Barr\u2019s speech. \u201cPeople will go. It doesn\u2019t matter if the fence is electric\u2014we\u2019ll fry, but we\u2019re still going.\u201d\n\nMigrants simply hopped it, dug under it, sprinted past Border Patrol when they weren\u2019t looking, or walked its length to enter the United States through the rougher terrain of the San Ysidro Mountains. And they\u2019ve been doing so ever since.\n\n\u201cThe deterrent effect of tens of billions of dollars in investments in Barr\u2019s approach to immigration control never materialized,\u201d said Professor Wayne Cornelius, an expert on the mass politics of immigration at the University California, San Diego, who criticized Barr\u2019s proposal at the time as a \u201cKeystone Kops\u201d approach to immigration enforcement, both inflammatory and ineffective.\n\nThe fence\u2019s manifest failure remains a major indication that Barr, now nominated to serve as attorney general once again under President Donald Trump, will be an enthusiastic supporter of the centerpiece of Trump\u2019s immigration policy\u2014a proposed border wall that is 1,986 miles longer than Barr\u2019s own unsuccessful iteration.\n\nBut a failure to learn from the mistakes of three decades ago, Cornelius said, could leave American taxpayers on the hook for repeating an expensive mistake.\n\n\u201cNine out of ten migrants who weren\u2019t discouraged from leaving home and coming to the U.S. border were not kept out of the country,\u201d Cornelius told The Daily Beast. \u201c[Barr\u2019s] 1992 project is evidence that he has been a hard-liner on immigration enforcement for most of his government career\u2014his policy preferences haven\u2019t evolved.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress should know that if they vote to confirm,\u201d Cornelius said.\n\nSo convinced was Barr that the 14-mile fence was all that was needed to slow the stream of undocumented immigrants entering the country into a trickle that, two weeks after its announcement, he told PBS NewsHour that presidential candidate Pat Buchanan\u2019s proposal to erect a barrier along the entire U.S.-Mexico border amounted to a hat on a hat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Barr told Jim Lehrer. \u201cI think that\u2019s overkill to put a barrier from one side of the border to the other\u2026 Illegal immigrants do not cross in the middle of the desert and walk hundreds of miles to the nearest city.\u201d\n\nBarr confidently pointed to his own barrier as having \u201creduced violence and made it easier to interdict the aliens crossing\u201d within a matter of weeks, a belief he clung to even years after the fence failed to meaningfully reduce the number of undocumented immigrants who successfully entered California from Mexico.\n\n\u201cGood steps were taken, and the Bush administration was getting a lot more control over it, including putting up the fences,\u201d Barr told the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center in an expansive 2001 interview about his tenure at the Department of Justice, in which he defended the fences as having \u201ccut down substantially on immigration.\u201d\n\n\u201cI devoted a lot of effort and energy to doing our best to shut down the border in California,\u201d Barr said of his time overseeing Immigration and Naturalization Services, the government agency later succeeded by Citizenship and Immigration Services, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection. \u201cWe kept on pushing them further west, and then eventually you get them going over long stretches of open ground, and once you get them out of the cities\u2026\u201d\n\nBut the assertion that Barr\u2019s border fence succeeded in stemming migration into the United States from Mexico, Cornelius said, did not bear out in subsequent field studies of the region, which revealed that roughly 90 percent of undocumented migrants hoping to gain entry into the country succeeded in entering the United States on their most recent trip to the border.\n\nIf confirmed as the new attorney general, Cornelius said, \u201cwe can expect Mr. Barr to be one of the undaunted cheerleaders for Trump\u2019s approach to immigration policy. If he and his colleagues are successful, taxpayers will once again be stiffed.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment on whether Barr learned any lessons from the 1992 fence\u2019s failure, but by all indications, the Trump administration views Barr\u2019s supervision of the fence fiasco as a positive.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an outstanding man,\u201d Trump told law enforcement officials in early December, hours after officially naming Barr as the nominee to succeed the beleaguered Jeff Sessions as attorney general. \u201cDuring his tenure, he demonstrated an unwavering adherence to the rule of law... There is no one more capable or more qualified for this role.\u201d", "description": "Barr\u2019s solution to the immigration crisis was, in a way, decades ahead of its time: the construction of a heavily armored steel fence along the U.S.-Mexico border.", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1547417874/190113-bixby-barr-tease_slgcfg", "published_at": "2019-01-14"}
