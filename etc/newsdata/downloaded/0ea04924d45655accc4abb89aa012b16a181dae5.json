Many lawmakers voiced opposition, and former Labour prime minister Tony Blair lambasted the move as \"undemocratic, damaging and politically dangerous.\"\n\nBefore Labour's governing National Executive Committee was set to debate the motion Saturday, Corbyn sought to put a lid on the dispute by proposing that the body should instead carry out a review of the deputy leader's role.\n\nHeading into conference, Corbyn tried to put a brave face on the row and said he enjoyed working with Watson, who was elected deputy leader at the same time Corbyn took the helm of the Labour Party in September 2015.\n\n\"The NEC agreed this morning that we are going to consult on the future of diversifying the deputy leadership position to reflect the diversity of our society,\" Corbyn said.\n\nQuestioned by reporters, Corbyn refused to say when he first knew about the attempt to oust Watson, nor whether he had full confidence in his deputy.\n\nWatson told BBC radio before the proposal was ditched that the attempt to oust him was akin to \"a straight sectarian attack on a broad-church party\" and he believed his position on Brexit was behind it.\n\nHe said the move against him came as a shock and that he was in a Chinese restaurant in Manchester Friday evening when he learned about it.\n\nLansman said in a tweet that he welcomed Corbyn's proposal for a review and added that the party needs \"to make sure the deputy leader role is properly accountable to the membership while also unifying the party at conference.\"\n\nWhether Corbyn has done enough to keep the row from overshadowing the conference due to end Wednesday remains to be seen. The fissures in the party over Brexit will likely be evident, though.\n\nA draft statement by Labour's governing body Saturday suggests the party go into a general election without specifying whether it would support remaining in the EU in the promised second referendum.\n\nThe statement said the party would get the issue \"sorted one way or another\" with a referendum within six months if Labour formed the next government.\n\nPro-EU Labour activists fear the NEC's approach could be a way of stopping debate on their call for Labour to back remaining in the EU whatever the circumstances.\n\n\"This move is just plain wrong,\" said Clive Lewis, a Labour lawmaker in the party's Treasury team.\n\nAn election is widely expected to be held in the next few months whether or not the country has left the EU on the scheduled Brexit date of Oct. 31.\n\nConservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson tried twice this month to get Parliament to back an election. Labour, in conjunction with other opposition parties, voted against the proposal. They want to make sure a no-deal Brexit is blocked before agreeing to an election.\n\nParliament is now suspended until Oct. 14, just over two weeks before the U.K. is due to leave the EU. However, it may be forced to return if the Supreme Court decides Johnson broke the law when he suspended Parliament.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP's full coverage of Brexit and British politics at: https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
