Now they are publishing photos of how much the Earth has changed over that time. Here, a photo shows the effect of the plastic crisis\n\nInternational eco-charity Greenpeace was one of the first environmental organisations to jump on the trending hashtag.\n\nIt shared two photographs highlighting the effect of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe eye-opening images show the difference between the leafy green Amazon rainforest ten years ago, and its relative nakedness today.\n\nUsers on Twitter have responded saying that viral trend is 'the saddest you'll see' and the 'only 10 year challenge we need to think about'.\n\nExperts say that global warming was linked to a changing tree composition - meaning as some tree species died, not enough were springing up to replace them.\n\nOther images show large iceberg on the left, and a melted iceberg on the right emphasising that shrinking ice sheets continue to be a major issue.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Going in a more serious direction, people are posting pictures to highlight how much the face of our planet has been altered in just ten years. This slide image shows the difference between a colourful coral reef next to sea bed where climate change has caused coral bleaching\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Environmental groups have taken to Instagram, Twitter and Facebook to show how drastically different parts of the world have changed as a direct result of human interference. Here, an image from the California Department of Water Resources\n\nSocial media users are now using the challenge for a much more important reason - to warn people of the threat of global warming. This image though, is not taken ten years apart but one hundred years apart\n\nGreenpeace posted a pair of pictures of the Amazon rainforest ten years ago (left) and today. Increased temperatures and droughts are taking their toll on the Amazon as trees are unable to adapt to the changing climate\n\nAntarctica is losing about 127 gigatonnes of ice mass every year, while Greenland loses 286 gigatonnes annually, according to NASA.\n\nThey said that this is largely down to rising global temperatures being absorbed by oceans.\n\nAnother pair of images show a Pakistan rainforest ten years ago and today. Pakistan has been the eighth most-affected by climate change over the last two decades.\n\nGreenpeace was one of the first environmental organisations share two photographs of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest followed by organisations like WWF UK. Some have deemed the viral trend the 'only 10 year challenge we need to think about' and 'the saddest you'll see'\n\nImages of a starving polar bear resulted in public outcry about human impacts on the natural world. Pictured, an emancipated polar bear (right) stumbling through a terrain devoid of snow and ice next to an image of a healthy polar bear taken in 2009\n\nGerman Ambassador to Pakistan Martin Kobler posted an article about the country's problem alongside a tweet: 'Water shortage in Balochistan is endangering humans & animals. 10 years from now, it can be either better or worse.. depending on our actions of today.'\n\nPlanet Love Life, the makers of marine debris awareness bracelets, shared an arresting coral reef shot to raise awareness of what we're doing to our oceans.\n\nIt said: 'Coral reefs are dying at an alarming rate all around the globe. They need our help. We are dedicated to saving ALL life on our planet, including corals.'\n\nIn a more poignant message, organisations have begun to pre-empt between now and 2029 with the image from today depicting a whale emerging from the water and in 2029, an ocean with no whale (right)\n\nAnother tweet calls attention to the fact that non-degradable materials such as plastic bottles don't ever go away. The pair of images shows a bottle in 2009, and the bottle ten years later, which is still intact (right)\n\nIn a more heart rending message, organisations have begun to pre-empt between now and 2029 with the image from today depicting a whale emerging from the water and in 2029, an ocean with no whale.\n\nAnother tweet calls attention to the fact that non-degradable materials such as plastic bottles don't ever go away.\n\nThe pair of images shows a bottle in 2009, and the bottle ten years later, which is still intact.\n\nThe average time for a plastic bottle to completely degrade is at least 450 years.", "description": "International eco-charity Greenpeace was one of the first environmental organisations to jump on the trending hashtag, sharing two photographs that highlight the effect of Amazon deforestation.", "authors": ["Victoria Bell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/22/15/8842692-0-image-a-34_1548172231624.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-22"}
