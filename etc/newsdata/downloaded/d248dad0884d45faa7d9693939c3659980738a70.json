Furthermore, Pharming has not received or seen any proprietary CSL information from Dr Chiao or any other source.\"\n\nCentral role in therapies development\n\nAccording to US court documents obtained by The Australian Financial Review, CSL Behring accused Dr Chiao of emailing to his personal account and downloading to a thumb drive thousands of CSL Behring files of highly sensitive information about therapy outcomes, product development and business strategies.\n\nCSL outlined that in the weeks leading up to September 23 when Dr Chiao resigned, he took confidential information from CSL servers. It noted that Dr Chiao played a central role in the development and medical affairs strategy associated with HAE therapies. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic condition that causes swelling under the skin and lining of the gut and lungs.\n\nThe biotech claimed that on Sunday, September 22, Dr Chiao copied about 60 folders to a portable USB drive, and several thousand documents were copied.\n\n\"There is no reason to believe that tens of thousands of documents may have been copied,\" the court documents said.\n\nDr Chiao has been suspended pending the outcome of the court hearing.\n\nPharming has a long-term partnership with the China State Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry \u2013 a Sinopharm company \u2013 for joint global development of new products, including those to treat haemophilia A.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCSL chairman Brian McNamee said on Wednesday that the $114 billion company takes intellectual property security very seriously, while delivering an upbeat outlook confirming full-year guidance and helping to push the stock to a record high.\n\nUBS on Thursday upped its target price to $263 per share from $248, with a \"neutral\" call.\n\nCSL is trading on a multiple of 35x 12-month forward P/E \u2013 a 44 per cent premium to the ASX 100 (ex-financials) \u2013 which UBS says might already reflect a robust outlook for IG (immunoglobulin) volume/price growth, but it believes there is ongoing upside risk to consensus forecasts.", "description": "The pharmaceutical company's shares tumbled overnight in Europe after it was revealed CSL took legal action in the US against its former staffer and the company.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5973%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/aa0809f37e5ad0c898a7798bbaeb9817dbb15327", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
