In a letter intended for the 37,000 employees at the UN secretariat and obtained by CBS News and other outlets, Guterres said unspecified \"additional stop-gap measures\" would have to be taken to ensure salaries and entitlements are paid.\n\n\"Member States have paid only 70 percent of the total amount needed for our regular budget operations in 2019. This translates into a cash shortage of $230 million at the end of September. We run the risk of depleting our backup liquidity reserves by the end of the month,\" he wrote.\n\nTo cut costs, Guterres mentioned postponing conferences and meetings and reducing services, while also restricting official travel to only essential activities and taking measures to save energy.\n\nGuterres had asked member states earlier this year to up contributions to the world body to head off cash flow problems, but they refused, a UN official told French news agency AFP on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"The ultimate responsibility for our financial health lies with Member States,\" Guterres said.\n\nNot including what it pays for peacekeeping operations, the UN's operating budget for 2018-2019 is close to $5.4 billion, with the United States contributing the largest share at 22 percent.\n\nTrump tells U.N.: \"The future does not belong to globalists\"\n\nAs the Council on Foreign Relations explained earlier this year, U.S. contributions are vital to the UN's operations, and cuts to discretionary contributions implemented by Mr. Trump's administration have already forced the UN agency that serves Palestinian refugees to make deep cuts.\n\nThe White House has been pushing for a broad reassessment of the U.S. contribution to the UN budget since Mr. Trump took office.", "description": "Secretary-General eyes cost-cutting measures, says members have paid only 70 percent of amount needed, leaving \"a cash shortage of $230 million\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/11/20/2ba4c023-66b8-4bf2-9205-f1bb6679b50c/thumbnail/1200x630g2/7c9c74b3a319992a286fe9e69c144990/rtx3g34t.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
