REUTERS/Russell Cheyne\n\nScots rejected independence in a referendum in 2014 but the SNP says that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union fundamentally changes its constitutional arrangements and means that the independence question should be revisited.\n\nSturgeon, who is also Scotland\u2019s First Minister, said she was \u201csick of Brexit\u201d and that the United Kingdom was a broken political system that imposed policies on Scotland against its will.\n\nBritain as a whole voted in 2016 to leave the European Union but Scotland voted to remain, and Sturgeon has often campaigned for secession on the grounds that the country is now being taken out of the EU against its wishes.\n\nOpinion polls show Brexit has slightly boosted the pro-independence vote but suggest it is still only around 50%.\n\nSpeaking at the SNP\u2019s annual conference in Aberdeen, Sturgeon said: \u201cIt is time for Scotland to choose our own future. It is time to reclaim our independence.\n\n\u201cOur job is to deliver independence. My call is that the referendum must happen next year. And we are getting ready,\u201d she added, to cheers from members of the SNP, Scotland\u2019s main political party.\n\nAs the law stands, to hold another referendum legally, Scotland would need the permission of the British government in Westminster.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it would be \u201ctotally wrong\u201d to hold another referendum, and that to hold a vote, the UK government would need to transfer powers to Scotland\u2019s devolved parliament where Sturgeon sits.\n\nSturgeon said she would demand those powers, under Section 30 of the Scotland Act, to ensure any vote was legal.\n\n\u201cBefore the end of this year, I will demand the transfer of power that puts the legality of a referendum beyond any doubt,\u201d she said.\n\nThe SNP has often expressed its sympathy for the cause of Catalan separatists. On Monday, Spain\u2019s Supreme Court jailed nine Catalan separatist leaders for their role in a failed independence bid.\n\nSturgeon said that though she understood the importance of the rule of law, \u201cany law that sends politicians to prison for organising a vote is a law that surely needs to change.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cthe politicians and activists from Catalonia... are peaceful campaigners for the right to self determination just like we are.\u201d", "description": "Scotland must hold another independence referendum in 2020 and will soon request the powers needed to hold it legally, Scottish National Party (SNP) leader Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Russell Cheyne", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441151732&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1CR", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
