She was arrested in August after crossing to the West Bank to attend a family wedding and so far has not been indicted.\n\nSafadi said Israel\u2019s administrative detention of both citizens was \u201cillegal\u201d and vowed his country would \u201ctake all necessary legal and diplomatic measures to ensure their safe return home.\u201d\n\nJordan\u2019s relations with Israel have been strained in recent years and the kingdom, which is one of only two Arab states that have a peace treaty with its neighbor, fears Israel\u2019s possible annexation of territory in the occupied West Bank, where expansion of settlement building over several decades has dimmed prospects of a future Palestinian state.\n\nThe peace treaty with Israel is unpopular among the people of Jordan, where pro-Palestinian sentiment is widespread. Many of Jordan\u2019s 7 million citizens are of Palestinian origin.\n\n(The story is refiled to clarify that Jordan fears possible annexation)", "description": "Jordan recalled its ambassador to Israel for consultations in protest over Israel's refusal to heed its demands to release two citizens it said were illegally detained for months without charges, the kingdom's foreign minister said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
