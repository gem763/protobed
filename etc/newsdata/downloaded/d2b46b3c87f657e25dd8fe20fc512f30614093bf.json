It has weakened our capabilities and undermined our gains.\"\n\nIn June 2017, the four countries imposed a sea, land and air blockade on Qatar, accusing it of supporting \"terrorism\".\n\nThe four Arab states also issued a 13-point list of demands, insisting that Qatar shut down the Al Jazeera network, close a Turkish military base and scale down ties with Iran.\n\nDoha rejected the demands and has repeatedly denied the allegations.\n\nKuwait, led by Sheikh Sabah, has been acting as a mediator. Shuttle diplomacy efforts by the US have also failed to end the dispute - now in its third year.\n\nThe Kuwaiti ruler called on the Gulf nations to \"immediately rise above our differences, mend fences and restore our friendly relations\".\n\nSheikh Sabah returned to Kuwait on October 16 after medical treatment in the US.\n\nState media said he suffered an unidentified health setback in August before travelling to the US to meet President Donald Trump. The meeting was cancelled after he was admitted to hospital.", "description": "In his first address since medical treatment in US, Sheikh Sabah said ongoing regional dispute has weakened GCC unity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/bd916f05bd3644059c9edb598aae62d9_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
