But wars, terrorism, and violence targeting this minority forced most of them to flee for their lives, with many settling in the United States or Israel.\n\nWhen Jews fled Yemen, they took along their highly-valued religious items and artifacts. One such item is a Torah Scroll, believed to be hundreds of years old, that was smuggled out of Yemen to Israel by the family of Manny Dahari.\n\nDahari's family has owned the scroll for at least 300 years, but Yemen\u2019s government is hoping to get it and other Jewish items back, claiming them as \u201cnational cultural artifacts.\u201d\n\nYemen's government has filed a request with the U.S. State Department for a Memorandum of Understanding, which if granted would recognize Yemen\u2019s ownership of the items. Anyone transporting or possessing such items, like the Daharis\u2019 Torah Scroll, could face sanctions.\n\nFEARS US WEAPONS ARE FALLING INTO THE 'WRONG HANDS' DURING CHAOTIC YEMENI WAR\n\n\u201cBasically it would criminalize anyone who brings any of these items to the United States, or takes them out of those countries,\" says Dahari.\n\nThe fear is that Yemen wouldn\u2019t properly care for the relics. The government has a history of persecuting Jews and, destroying homes, synagogues and other remnants of Jewish life in Yemen. The country's Iran-backed Houthi rebels are known for often doing the same. Dahari\u2019s family was already extorted in an effort to give up the scroll, and they believe the Yemenis would have either destroyed the scroll or try to sell it to unscrupulous collectors.\n\nJewish groups worldwide have asked the U.S. government not to honor by Yemen\u2019s request.\n\nYEMEN'S CHILD SOLDIERS FACE LONG ROAD AFTER SEXUAL, PHYSICAL ABUSE\n\n\u201cJewish cultural property such as Torah Scrolls does not constitute the national heritage of governments who expel or who forced their Jewish communities to flee anti-Semitic prosecution,\u201d says Sarah Levin, the executive director of Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa (JIMENA). Yemeni Jews are part of a distinct ethnic Jewish rite known as \u201cMizrahi.\u201d While Mizrahi Jews once called lands like Yemen and Iran their homes, they now mostly live in Israel.\n\nTorah Scrolls are sacred to all Jews. They contain the first five books of the Bible handwritten by artisan scribes in special calligraphy using natural ink on animal parchment. Jews also believe that the Torah Scrolls themselves, in addition to the biblical text they contain, are of Divine nature. To allow a scroll to fall into disrepair or to be damaged is considered a desecration and a blasphemy.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe State Department could make its ruling on Yemen\u2019s request by the end of this month.\n\nEben Brown is a FOX News National Correspondent in Miami.
