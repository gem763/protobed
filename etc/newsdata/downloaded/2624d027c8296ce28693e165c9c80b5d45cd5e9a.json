It's about taking action.\"\n\nThe mother of two, who rose to fame for her coverage of severe weather on \"Good Morning America,\" revealed in her book \"Natural Disaster: I Cover Them. I am One,\" that weeks before she began working at ABC News in 2011, she checked herself into a mental health hospital to seek treatment.\n\n\"I want the ability to go to a hospital because you\u2019re mentally ill to be just like going to a hospital for anything else that you\u2019re ill for,\" she said. \"I want an annual checkup to always include mental health -- because we should be taking care of our minds as well as we take care of our bodies.\"\n\nKingswell\n\nZee, 38, has openly addressed many aspects of her personal life, including being involved in an emotionally abusive relationship and her battle with depression, which gave readers a rare glimpse of aspects of her life not shown on TV.\n\n\"I want it to be regular for people to find meditation and all these alternative ways of addressing what\u2019s happening [in our head] to be accepted,\" she said.\n\nZee also noted that rehabilitation for drugs and alcohol in our society is \"fully accepted.\"\n\n\"I want mental health rehabilitation to feel like that,\" she said.", "description": "ABC News' chief meteorologist opens up about mental health in our society on World Suicide Prevention Day.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/ginger-zee-portrait-abc-ps-190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
