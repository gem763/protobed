I get that thought process 100%,\u201d she went on. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the toll that the trauma takes\u2026 I don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ve got left of that to cry out anymore.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Jana Kramer Opens Up About Finding Woman\u2019s Topless Photo on Husband\u2019s Phone Years After Infidelities\n\nAs for how Caussin felt about the incident, the former NFL player doubled down on his regret, telling Bush, \u201cThis has probably been the most difficult thing to date\u2026 Everything that we\u2019ve shared, this has probably been the most difficult to swallow.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast night, I couldn\u2019t sleep because I\u2019m tired of feeling like the bad guy and it is because of my shame,\u201d he added.\n\nDespite his remorse, Caussin said he found a silver lining in the situation by realizing how their candidness has helped other men and couples deal with similar problems.\n\n\u201cWith the live podcast that Jana and I do, and take on tour, that is probably the most impactful feedback,\u201d he shared. \u201cWhen we hear from men who say thank you to both of us or for opening up and enabling them to open up a little more than they would have in the past.\u201d\n\nMike Caussin and Jana Kramer More\n\nRELATED: Jana Kramer Is Grateful She Didn\u2019t Take the \u2018Easy Way Out\u2019 After Husband Mike Caussin\u2019s Infidelities\n\nKramer previously admitted on the podcast that she thought the woman might have been fake, recalling how she tried to emotionally connect with her and get more information about their relationship but instead, was met with responses about Caussin coming over.\n\n\u201cI called the number and then I texted it and it was like, \u2018Sorry hun, can\u2019t talk on the phone. Do you want me to come over?'\u201d Kramer said on Monday\u2019s episode. \u201cAnd I was just like, \u2018You texted my husband. I would love to know your correspondence. Please, from one woman to another.'\u201d\n\nAlthough she believed the number might be fake, the country star said she was ultimately betrayed by Caussin\u2019s action to withhold information.\n\n\u201cThe sneakiness of feeling like he deleted it \u2026 I\u2019m just sick of finding things. Then someone says don\u2019t look but it\u2019s hard not to look when I have that intuition to look,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cThe deleting things, whether it was a fluke text, sends me right back to him deleting all the messages that he did with his affairs. It\u2019s just heavy. My anxiety level is through the roof.\u201d\n\nMike Caussin and Jana Kramer | Joe Scarnici/Getty More", "description": "Jana Kramer Claims Topless Woman in Mike Caussin's Phone Was a Bot", "authors": ["Joelle Goldstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x2h9vdxJrWlbC980TOqhPQ--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/1149d96d8b1a25302d48caa82b20537c", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
