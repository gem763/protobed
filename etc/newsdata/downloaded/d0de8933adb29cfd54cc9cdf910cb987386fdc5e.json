Attorney General William Barr delivered the other speech to the law school and the de Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nPompeo discussed how, as a young man at West Point, he refocused his Christian faith to the center of his life. He went on to relate how this influences today how he understands America's role in the world and how he does his job as secretary of state.\n\nBarr discussed the aggressive and destructive secularism now sweeping the country. He touched on the key point, made first by then-President George Washington in his 1796 farewell address to the nation, that a free nation must be a self-governing nation and that this only is possible through moral virtue.\n\nLimited government requires a population that rules itself. This requires, as Barr explained, \"shared moral values\" that \"rest on authority independent of men's will -- they must flow from a transcendent Supreme Being.\"\n\nThere is no way two high-profile officials from the Trump administration would give public presentations like these without support from the president, particularly in today's highly charged political environment.\n\nPompeo and Barr communicated a worldview starkly in contrast to what we're hearing from the Democratic presidential hopefuls, most recently at the debate in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nThe line is drawn clearly in the sand.\n\nPresident Trump is running on the premise that America is a free nation Under God.\n\nDemocrats see our future in secular humanism.\n\nIn the Democrat world, politicians define for us what social justice is, and politicians use the power of government to implement their vision.\n\nPractically, this means massive expansion of government and politicians like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, or whomever Democrats wind up choosing, running our lives and deciding who should have what.\n\nAt least some Democrats are asking where the tens of trillions of dollars will come from to pay for proposals like \"Medicare for All.\"\n\nBut let's look at it a different way.\n\nWho is going to pay for all the government required by the collapse of the American family?\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Americans ages 55 and above accounted for 56% of all health care expenditures in 2016.\n\nOur population is now shrinking due to fewer births, a direct result of acceptance of abortion and young people shunning marriage and family.\n\nThe result is an aging population. The Census Bureau projects that by 2034, 15 years from now, for the first time ever, there will be more Americans over 65, 77 million, than under 18, 76.5 million.\n\nFewer and fewer working Americans bearing the health care and retirement burdens of increasing numbers of elderly is not a picture for a healthy future. But it is the future that secular humanism is delivering and will continue to deliver.\n\nThe 2016 election was about pushing back from this trend and restoring a free nation Under God.\n\nPresident Trump is delivering on this with deregulation, tax cuts, more conservative judges at every level of our judiciary, and pro-life, pro-family values.\n\nThe American Revolution was about freedom.\n\nAmericans don't want a king who thinks he's God running our lives. This includes Democratic secular humanists who want the same kind of power King George in England had, against whom the American colonists rebelled.\n\nGeorge Washington was right in 1796, and President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Pompeo and Attorney General Barr are right in 2019.\n\nA free nation is a self-governing nation, and a self-governing nation lives according to eternal biblical truths.", "description": "Two recent high-profile speeches by Trump administration officials say much .10/23/2019 10:54:21AM EST.", "authors": ["Star Parker", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/57/a7a051b8-13bf-4f28-8bb1-ec7f87342a40.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
