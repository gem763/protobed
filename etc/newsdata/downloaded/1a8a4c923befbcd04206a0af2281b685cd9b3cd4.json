(AP) - John Prine\u2019s winning streak has continued at the Americana Music Association\u2019s annual awards ceremony in Nashville, though his two-year reign as Americana artist of the year has ended.\n\nThe 72-year-old folk singer-songwriter took home two major honors on Wednesday at Nashville\u2019s historic Ryman Auditorium. Prine won album of the year for \u201cThe Tree of Forgiveness,\u201d his first collection of new material in 13 years, and a song he wrote with Pat McLaughlin, \u201cSummer\u2019s End,\u201d won song of the year.\n\nPrine, who had won artist of the year the previous two years and had battled health problems recently, was joined on stage by Bonnie Raitt for a stirring duet of \u201cAngel from Montgomery,\u201d the Prine song that became a show-stopper for both artists. In his first acceptance speech, Prine joked that he could use the speeches he wrote for the Grammys, where he was nominated but did not win.\n\nAmericana artist of the year honors for 2019 went to Brandi Carlile, the first woman to win it since Gillian Welch claimed the title in 2012. The award topped off a stellar run for the earthy singer-songwriter whose album, \u201cBy the Way, I Forgive You,\u201d won three Grammy awards earlier this year. Carlile was one of several winners to sing the praises of producer Dave Cobb, who had a hand in the work of multiple winners and nominees.\n\nOn a night that showcased the diversity of a genre that ranges from blues to gospel to country, all of the nominees for artist of the year were female. That set the Americana awards apart from other country music award shows this year. The other finalists were Mavis Staples, Kacey Musgraves and Rhiannon Giddens.\n\nStaples, who built a tour this year around her 80th birthday in July, was given the association\u2019s first annual Inspiration Award, presented by television journalist John Seigenthaler on behalf of the Freedom Forum and the First Amendment Center, and Ernest \u201cRip\u201d Patton, who protested segregation on interstate buses as a \u201cfreedom rider\u201d during the civil rights movement in the early 1960s.\n\nStaples, who had been a movement mainstay as a member of her family\u2019s band, the Staple Singers, said in her acceptance speech that the freedom songs she sang in that era were still relevant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still here and we are still carrying on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re still singing our freedom songs.\u201d\n\nStaples closed the awards ceremony by leading a star-studded rendition of the gospel classic \u201cI\u2019ll Fly Away.\u201d\n\nGiddens shared a legacy of Americana award with the late Frank Johnson, an African-American musician whose band was popular during the 1800s but whose contributions have largely been forgotten. Giddens noted in her remarks that Johnson\u2019s influence continues to be felt by modern-day musicians who had no idea where it came from.\n\nThe married duo known as The War and Treaty, Michael and Tanya Trotter, were honored as emerging act of the year, largely on the strength of their acclaimed 2018 album \u201cHealing Tide.\u201d\n\nThe trio known as I\u2019m With Her, comprised of Sarah Jarosz, Aoife O\u2019Donovan and Sara Watkins, won duo/group of the year honors, while Chris Eldridge was honored as instrumentalist of the year.\n\nPrine wasn\u2019t the only elder statesman to be honored. Eclectic rocker Elvis Costello won a lifetime achievement award for songwriting, roadhouse warrior Delbert McClinton was recognized with a lifetime achievement award for performance, and Maria Muldaur won a trailblazer award for her experimental adventures in American roots music.\n\nThe awards show is scheduled for television broadcast Nov. 23 as an episode of Austin City Limits on PBS.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "John Prine's winning streak has continued at the Americana Music Association's annual awards ceremony in Nashville, though his two-year reign as Americana artist of the year has ended.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Scott Stroud"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/music_americana_awards_80916_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
