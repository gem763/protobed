For me it's the baby loss storyline we did.\n\n\"I almost had to go back to a time in my life I'd rather not be reminded of. It was such an important story to tell and we helped so many people. I was standing in the House of Commons in front of Jeremy Hunt . It really reached out to people.\"\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "Corrie favourite Kym admitted the Carla Connor actress had been left in tears by her decision to leave the cobbles", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20749032.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Corries-Kym-Marsh-has-fallen-out-with-co-star-Alison-King-over-her-departure.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
