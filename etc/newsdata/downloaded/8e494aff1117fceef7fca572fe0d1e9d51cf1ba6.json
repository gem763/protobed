He is looking forward to meeting the players he doesn\u2019t know and building strong relationships.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of the guys in the Durban Heat squad but it\u2019s going to be great to build friendships with them that go beyond cricket.\n\n\u201cIt is important that as players we use these chances to create friendships with players from different backgrounds because we will be teammates for over a month,\u201d he added.\n\nAnother opportunity that Lubbe is looking forward to is working with head coach Gary Kirsten.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fantastic having someone with Gary\u2019s knowledge at the helm. It\u2019s incredible that I will be able to bounce ideas of someone with his experience and I cannot wait to learn from him.\u201d\n\nTrading the Highveld for the KZN coast for a month and a bit is another element of the Mzansi Super League that Lubbe is looking forward to.\n\n\u201cObviously the beach is one of the things that I am looking forward to,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOne of my good friends Marques Ackerman moved to the Dolphins and only has good things to say about the lifestyle.\n\n\u201cI know that there are a lot of good golf courses around there so I will definitely be trying those out.\u201d\n\nThe Durban Heat kick off their 2019 Mzansi Super League campaign against the Tshwane Spartans at Hollywoodbets Kingsmead Stadium on Saturday, 9 November.\n\nDurban Heat Squad:\n\nAndile Phehlukwayo, Alex Hales, David Miller (retained player), Dane Vilas, Ravi Bopara, Keshav Maharaj (retained player), Kyle Abbott (retained player), Khaya Zondo (retained player), Marco Jansen, Daryn Dupavillon, Sarel Erwee (retained player), Malusi Siboto, Prenelan Subrayen, Wihan Lubbe, Shaun von Berg, Rob Frylinck.\n\n- Gameplan Media", "description": "All-rounder Wihan Lubbe is hoping to make an immediate impact when he strides out in Durban Heat colours for this year\u2019s Mzansi Super League.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9508/b6787a5f3aaa480e956c8d39c13c2f28.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
