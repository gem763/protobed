I won't invest in something based solely on the idea. I need to see a proven model with some form of revenue and growth. It's also about believing in the person driving the business. A great idea with a poor operator will lead to failure.\"\n\nChris Ball's agrees success in start-up investing is all about a great founder, a commercially validated product and a dynamic market. \"Equally, you should be looking for opportunities that suit your own interests and skills.\"\n\nJames Spenceley, chair of online job site Airtasker and CEO of small cap investment fund MHOR Asset Management suggests investors take a minimum five to 10-year timeframe when investing in start-ups.\n\n\"I like to look 10 years into the future at what we will be doing. As an example, Seek is an obvious way now to find a job now compared to job ads in the paper. So the question to ask is what will be as obvious when people who are 16 today are 26 and spending money?\n\n\"Nick Ball explains many wealthy people invest through venture funds, some invest as a group through a syndicate and others will invest directly in a start-up's shares.\n\n\"Most often the introduction is through a friend or colleague but it may also be through attending pitch contests and other start-up events. After some due diligence, a high net worth investor in Australia will usually invest somewhere between $50,000 and $250,000 in early stage ventures, depending on their circumstances.\"\n\nBall says investing alongside friends or acquaintances tends to give investors insights into the quality of the start-up's founder. \"This makes it easier to make the investment and keep an eye on it informally. When investing, it is really important to make sure there are proper legal documents like shareholder agreements in place.\"\n\nHe believes regular formal and informal communication between founders and investors is essential. \"Most high net worth investors have been successful themselves, so they can sometimes be a great adviser or mentor if needed,\" he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpenceley says his extended group of friends all share ideas. \"Amcom founder and former Vocus director Tony Grist and I have done five deals together. Once I discovered Airtasker a number of friends like former Vocus director Jon Brett, previous Vocus deputy CEO Chris Deere and iinet founder Michael Malone all invested alongside me.\"\n\nSpenceley warns investing in start-ups is not for the fainthearted. \"There is typically no liquidity for many years, so you can in theory be successful in the short term and still fail. You also have to be prepared for a number of the things you invest in to fail. That means losing money, which can be hard to deal with initially.\"\n\nChris Ball says investing in start-ups is all about understanding and making a decision about risk. \"The main ones are the flip-side of the things you look for, such as lack of a great founder.\"\n\nHe says it is also important to recognise some risks are specific to the sector in which the start-up operates. \"If it is a property start-up, most wealthy investors will already understand the market. That knowledge is a big part of identifying and making a decision about risk.\"\n\nNick Bell agrees it's essential to be across the risks when it comes to investing in new ventures. \"There are many to consider. The owner may have a meltdown due to personal reasons, industry regulation may change, or the business may become obsolete overnight due to a new and improved product or service.\"\n\nRunning out of money is a perennial problem. Says Bell: \"Investing in start-ups is risky, but sometimes you need to roll the dice for the big win. I liken start-up investing to legalised gambling.\"\n\nChris Ball warns start-ups do not always succeed. \"If a high net worth investor has invested so much it has a material effect on their wealth, then there will be relationship issues, except in the strongest and most graceful situations. In any case, realism and communication for any eventuality is key.\"", "description": "Wealthy investors tend to be savvy investors, and at the moment all eyes are on the burgeoning group of start-ups in the property technology sector.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.4222%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1895%2C$x_105%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7876a53946e59f5655eda39c3507356b4159f9c3", "published_at": "2018-07-10"}
