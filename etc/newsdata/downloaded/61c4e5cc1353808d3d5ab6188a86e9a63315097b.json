These victims were killed by acquaintances, partners and strangers, some of whom have been arrested and charged, while others have yet to be identified. Some of these cases involve clear anti-transgender bias. In others, the victim\u2019s transgender status may have put them at risk in other ways, such as forcing them into unemployment, poverty, homelessness and/or survival sex work.\n\nWhile the details of these cases differ, it is clear that fatal violence disproportionately affects transgender women of color, and that the intersections of racism, sexism, homophobia, biphobia and transphobia conspire to deprive them of employment, housing, healthcare and other necessities, barriers that make them vulnerable. HRC Foundation\u2019s \u201cDismantling a Culture of Violence\u201d report demonstrates how anti-transgender stigma, denial of opportunity and increased risk factors compound to create a culture of violence -- and provides clear ways that each of us can directly make an impact to make our society a safer place for transgender people.\n\nAs is too often the case in the reporting of anti-transgender violence, many of these victims are misgendered in local police statements and media reports, which can delay our awareness of deadly incidents. In the pursuit of greater accuracy and respect for transgender and gender expansive people in both life and death, HRC offers guidelines for journalists and others who report on transgender people.\n\nSadly, 2019 has already seen at least 19 transgender people fatally shot or killed by other violent means. As HRC continues to work toward justice and equality for transgender people, we mourn those we have lost:\n\nAdditionally, HRC is deeply concerned about the deaths of Johana \u2018Joa\u2019 Medina, Layleen Polanco and Ja\u2019leyah-Jamar, whose stories we are following closely. Medina, 25, died at a hospital in El Paso, Texas just hours after being released from ICE custody. She suffered severe health complications that went untreated while she was in detention, according to Diversidad Sin Fronteras. Her exact cause of death is not yet known. Polanco was found dead in a cell at Riker's Island on June 7. Ja'leyah-Jamar was fatally shot in Kansas City, Kansas, on September 13.\n\nHRC has been tracking reports of fatal anti-transgender violence for the past several years. Previous reports can be found: 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015.", "description": "As HRC continues to work toward justice and equality for transgender people, we mourn those we have lost.", "authors": ["Human Rights Campaign"], "top_image": "https://assets2.hrc.org/files/images/meta_images/Candles_SHARE_1200by630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
