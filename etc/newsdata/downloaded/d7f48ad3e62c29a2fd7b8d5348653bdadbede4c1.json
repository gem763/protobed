He was then taken into custody.\n\n'From my understanding, they basically gang-tackled him,' Chief Roark said.\n\n'There was a struggle ... Minor injuries occurred to the other guests who were in the struggle with the shooter.'\n\nHe added that it 'does not seem to be a random event'.\n\nBishop Stanley Choate was shot in the chest during the attack at New England Pentecostal Ministries during a wedding ceremony.

But police have not revealed the connection between the two families, or whether the man arrested in Saturday's attack is related to Garcia.\n\nChief Roark said at the press conference that police were investigating whether the alleged shooter targeted specific people during the attack.\n\n'We have a lot of witnesses to interview, as you might expect,' he said.\n\nThe shooting came just hours before a service was to be held for church minister Luis Garcia who was shot in the neck and killed last week. He's pictured here with his wife Patti\n\nPastor Garcia (pictured with wife Patti) was allegedly helping Brandon Castiglione, who is charged with his murder\n\nBrandon Castiglione, 24, has been charged with second-degree murder in Garcia's death\n\nFuneral services for Garcia were to be held at noon today at the church, but after the shooting mourners were turned away by police.\n\n'He was a Superman stopped by a bullet. He was a Christian Batman hit by a Joker,' a family member said of Garcia.\n\nThe New York Police Department Counterterrorism Bureau said it is 'closely monitoring the shooting incident at the New England Pentecostal church in Pelham, NH.'\n\nThe church website describes itself as 'committed to touching lives dramatically and bringing aid and deliverance to all people regardless of race, creed or color throughout all generations.\n\n'Our church welcomes people from all parts of New England and the Northeast area.'\n\nBishop Choate and his wife Ruth had been leading the church since 1987.\n\nOn Facebook, Nevia Choate wrote a post identifying herself as the bishop's neice.\n\nShe wrote: 'A coward walked into my family's church today at NEP New England Pentecostal Church and shot my uncle Bishop Stanley Choate. I call for anyone that knows and believes and In the GOD we serve to get on your knees and pray for my family.'\n\nHolloway is facing charges of first-degree assault and counts of purposely and knowingly causing bodily injury by means of a deadly weapon.", "description": "Officials said the bride, Clare McMullen, 60, was shot in the arm during the attack.
