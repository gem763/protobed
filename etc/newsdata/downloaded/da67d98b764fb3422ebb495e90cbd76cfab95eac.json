Rebuilding protections against the now virtually unlimited opportunities for influence-buying must be a priority once Trump is out of power.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe indictment of Giuliani\u2019s associates is well worth reading as a road map to how the system can be gamed. It illustrates, said veteran campaign reformer Fred Wertheimer, how Citizens United \u201ccreated a clear path for unlimited amounts of foreign money to enter our political system.\u201d\n\nThe arrests also make clear that Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call seeking help from Ukraine\u2019s president to smear Joe Biden was part of a larger structure of corruption that is the hallmark of the Trump presidency. Like many demagogues, Trump demonizes minorities and his political enemies to hide his devotion to the art of the shady deal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrevor Potter, the center\u2019s president, said in an interview that his group noticed a May 17, 2018, contribution of $325,000 from a limited liability corporation, Global Energy Producers (GEP) to America First Action, Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC. GEP seemed to have no real business purpose, and Potter and his colleagues suspected it was a shell company, which is what it turned out to be. The indictment charges that Parnas, Fruman and two other defendants used GEP to make political donations funded by an unidentified Russian businessman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fluke they were caught,\u201d said Potter, a Republican and former chairman of the FEC. \u201cThe dark money system makes it almost impossible to find this stuff.\u201d\n\nPotter argued that in Citizens United and related rulings, the Supreme Court made \u201ca terrible mistake\u201d in \u201cminimizing the definition of corruption.\u201d He added: \u201cThe court fundamentally misunderstood how politics works and the dangers of corruption from unlimited and secret campaign spending. The chickens are coming home to roost in this indictment.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy bringing roosting chickens to public attention, big scandals build pressure for reform. One important effect of Watergate was passage of campaign finance laws that worked well for a generation. These laws needed updating even before the Supreme Court gutted protections against influence buying. The Trump Bazaar, populated by a variety of seedy characters, brings home the urgency of taking this task seriously.\n\nThe indictment, said Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), the lead sponsor of H.R. 1, the comprehensive reform bill approved this year by the House, \u201cis a glimpse into the broad culture of corruption and ethical blindness that has infected our politics, particularly in the area of campaign finance.\u201d\n\nHis use of the word \u201cculture\u201d is important. Legal limits on unsavory practices outlaw socially destructive actions but also signal what kinds of public behavior are morally unacceptable. Bad laws encourage bad habits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople cross these lines with impunity,\u201d Sarbanes told me, \u201cand if they can\u2019t even see the lines, they start thinking they can get away with anything.\u201d\n\nWhich brings it all back to a man whose words and actions suggest he really does believe he can get away with anything. It is a supreme irony that Trump triumphed by exploiting public disaffection with a political system so many Americans see as infested with sleaze and controlled by forces operating entirely for their own benefit.\n\nRather than being the cure for such maladies, he is their apotheosis, the culmination of all that has gone wrong in our politics. The task of the impeachment inquiry is to use his Ukrainian misadventure to bring home the breadth of the president\u2019s venality and self-dealing. The goal should be not only to rid the country of a dangerous leader but also to show how desperately our system needs repair.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The arrests of two Giuliani associates say a lot of about the dangers facing the U.S. electoral system.", "authors": ["E.J.
