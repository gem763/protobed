They had access to frail patients on hospital floors. Ultimately, they were convicted of murdering patients under their care.\n\nAs investigators assemble clues in at least two homicides and at least eight other suspicious deaths at a Clarksburg, West Virginia, Veterans Affairs hospital, past examples of health care workers who killed patients with unneeded medications \u2014 including insulin, the drug suspected in the VA deaths \u2014 show how difficult such cases can be to detect and prove.\n\n'I trusted those people': Red flags missed, limiting evidence in potential serial killer case at VA hospital\n\nCullen moved from hospital to hospital, taking new jobs when managers began to suspect his deadly ways. Although investigators collected forensic evidence implicating him, prosecutors did not charge him until a fellow nurse, wearing a wire, coaxed a confession.\n\nHarvey\u2019s arrest was a matter of luck. He used cyanide to poison a man hospitalized after a motorcycle crash, unwittingly triggering an Ohio law requiring autopsies on all motorcycle fatalities. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy had a genetic ability to smell cyanide, which triggered the investigation.\n\nFILE \u2013 In this Sept. 1987 file photo, serial killer Donald Harvey stands before a judge during sentencing in Cincinnati.

Such cases are distinct from medical errors in which doctors, nurses or other clinicians inadvertently harm or even kill patients through carelessness or mistakes.\n\nThese serial killers are often called \"angels of death,\" but those familiar with their behavior say the moniker rarely describes their crimes. More often, they kill with intent and out of compulsion, not compassion.\n\nElizabeth Yardley, a criminology professor at Birmingham City University in England, studies nurses who kill. In a 2014 research paper, she identified 16 convicted of murder over the past four decades in the United States, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom.\n\nInsulin was the drug most frequently used to poison patients. But health care killers also used sedatives, muscle relaxers, blood thinners, heart drugs and even bleach. Some started with one drug and moved to another as the pace of their killings increased.\n\nIn most cases, the killers poisoned patients with drugs taken from the hospital where they worked. Some nurses had legitimate access to the medicines. Others stole the drugs, bypassing safeguards to secure medication.\n\n\u201cThis is the challenge of investigating homicide in a health care setting \u2014 the suspects you are looking at are members of a staff,\" Yardley said. \u201cThose members have legitimate access to victims. They have the opportunity to harm them.\n\n\u201cIt can be an investigative nightmare.\u201d\n\n'You can't prove anything'\n\nCullen\u2019s string of suspicious deaths began in the late 1980s, after he landed his first nursing job through a staffing agency at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey.\n\nAs recounted in the book \u201cThe Good Nurse\u201d by journalist Charles Graeber, Saint Barnabas nurses in February 1991 noticed two patients in the hospital\u2019s critical care unit mysteriously crashing from low blood sugar levels.
