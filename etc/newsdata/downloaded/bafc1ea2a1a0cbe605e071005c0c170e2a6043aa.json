The account, with its quotes from scenes that never really existed in any film or TV show, is as good an introduction as any into the self-consciously *~*twisted*~* world of the Joker \u2014 or, ahem, Joker. As with any enduring comic-book character, Gotham\u2019s Clown Prince of Crime has gone through so many rebirths and reiterations over the decades (between his original DC run, the iconic Adam West TV series, the animated shows, the video games, and the live-action films), that\u2019s it\u2019s hard to believe a line like the above hasn\u2019t already been written. Has it?\n\nBe as you wish to seem -The Joker \u2014 joker's trick (@jokers_trick) September 30, 2019\n\nJoker\u2019s whole shtick \u2014 no matter the medium \u2014 is that the character is a loopy, confused liar with an ever-shifting backstory. As he quips in the 1988 Alan Moore comic Batman: The Killing Joke, \u201cI mean, what is it with you? What made you what you are? Girlfriend killed by the mob, maybe? Brother carved up by some mugger? Something like that, I bet. Something like that \u2026 Something like that happened to me, you know. I \u2026 I\u2019m not exactly sure what it was. Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another \u2026 If I\u2019m going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!\u201d Indeed, keeping all of the character\u2019s origin stories straight can be enough to drive even the most ardent Batstan into Arkham Asylum or the depths of @jokers_trick. So allow us to lay out the deck for you. Turn up the Steve Miller Band, put on your Boo Boo the Fool nose, and dive in to the chemical waste below, because we took this job extremely why-so-seriously.\n\nBatman #1 (1940)\n\nLike yin and yang, or clowns and flying rodents, the Joker has been around for nearly as long as his archrival, having been introduced in the very first issue of Batman #1. He arrived without an origin story, already a psychopath and killing for fun with his special toxin dubbed \u201cJoker\u2019s venom,\u201d which somehow left his victims with a permanent grin on their faces. The DC artists (Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson are credited with creating the character) initially intended to kill off Joker in order to make Batman appear more competent, but an editor allegedly reneged at the last minute, prompting the artists to hastily add a frame showing that the Joker had survived the issue, living to trick another day. By 1942, the writers had transformed him from a psychotic mass murderer into more of a goofy prankster, to better market the comics to kiddos. Because yeah, stuff like this isn\u2019t disturbing at all.\n\nDetective Comics #168, \u201cThe Man Behind the Red Hood!\u201d (1951)\n\nThis issue, penned by the character\u2019s co-creator Bill Finger, was the first to demystify the Joker\u2019s origins. According to Finger, the Joker was already committing crimes under a different alias \u2014 the Red Hood \u2014 when, one night as he was trying to rob a factory and evade Batman, he dove into a pool of chemical water. When he emerged, he was sporting the white skin, green hair, and general Billie Eilish look we\u2019ve come to associate with the Joker.\n\nBatman TV Series (1966)\n\nWhat Adam West\u2019s live-action Batman series lacked in things like three-dimensional characterization and story complexity, it more than made up for in panache. Among the series\u2019 many cultural contributions is Cesar Romero\u2019s performance as a fun, over-the-top Joker. He only appeared in a handful of episodes per season, and, seemingly preoccupied with his metal hand buzzers and gag flowers, he never really divulged a full backstory. What we do know from this version of the Joker is that he was a high-school dropout, hypnotist, and \u201cmaster of disguise\u201d who turned to crime. One episode featured a mugshot of him without the clown makeup, suggesting that it was a put-on, but Romero personally subscribed to the \u201cchemicals turned Joker\u2019s hair green\u201d backstory.\n\nThe Killing Joke (1988)\n\nHot off the release of his acclaimed Watchmen graphic novels, DC\u2019s golden boy of the post-Bronze Age, Alan Moore, adapted the 1951 Red Hood story for his own take on the Joker mythos in a one-off graphic novel The Killing Joke. In Moore\u2019s seminal version, the Joker was a mild-mannered engineer who quit his job at a chemical plant to pursue his dream of stand-up comedy. After failing miserably at comedy, he decides to help some criminals break into the chemical plant so that he can make some money for his pregnant wife, Jeannie. While planning the crime, Jeannie and their unborn child die in an unspecified accident, and later, at the chemical plant, Batman scares the engineer (now the Red Hood \u2014 keeping up?) into the plant\u2019s chemical waste catch basin. A pipe sweeps him outside, where he finds his appearance altered by the chemicals. That transformation and the grief over his wife\u2019s death drive him to become the Joker.\n\nTim Burton\u2019s Batman (1989)\n\nIn Tim Burton\u2019s Batman, Jack Nicholson plays Jack Napier, a Gotham City mobster responsible for mugging and killing Bruce Wayne\u2019s parents. Years later, he gets set up by a mob boss who plans to have him killed by a crooked cop at a chemical plant. Batman stops the accident, but Napier falls into a vat of chemicals (is that a motif I smell, or is it just that noxious vat of chemicals?) altering his visage and driving him, well, batty. In a delightfully 1980s touch, the Joker\u2019s smile is due to a botched plastic surgery job following the accident.\n\nMask of the Phantasm (1993)\n\nIn this theatrically released adaptation of Batman: The Animated Series, the Mark Hamill\u2013voiced Joker got his start as a hit man and chauffeur for Gotham City mob boss Salvatore Valestra. After carrying out a hit for him, the Man Who Would Be Joker started his own crime outfit, and endured a, yup, chemical plant accident that turned him extra Joker-y.\n\nBatman Confidential , \u201cLovers and Madmen\u201d (2007-2008)\n\nIn this limited series that let different writers get creative with the Bat-canon, the erstwhile Joker is introduced as Jack, a former hit man for a Gotham City crime family called the Berlantis. In this version, Batman is the one who actually causes the Jack\u2019s smile-shaped scar, during a showdown between the two. It\u2019s all very Harry and Voldemort, entwining their two fates. And then \u2014 because this ain\u2019t your grand-dad\u2019s origin story \u2014 instead of falling into chemicals at the chemical plant, the chemicals fall onto Jack, completing his transformation into the Joker.\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008)\n\nChristopher Nolan intended to leave his iteration of the Joker intentionally vague, making him all the more elemental a force of nature. As with comic-book versions of the Joker, this one\u2019s an unreliable narrator who gives differing accounts for his Glasgow grin and penchant for chaos. In one, he carves the smile into his own face leading his wife to leave him; in another, the disfigurement was an abusive parent\u2019s doing. And there are no chemical vats here; Joker goes incognito in one scene, makeup off and the swamp green seemingly washed out of his hair, insinuating that the discoloring is a choice. Those dark under-eye bags are all real, though.\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum (2009)\n\nIn Batman: Arkham Asylum, we get a chance to read the Joker\u2019s patient file, which lacks a \u201cprecise psychological diagnosis\u201d and adds that, \u201cHis past is unknown; conflicting, unconfirmed reports state that he was a failed comedian, a petty thief, and a broken family man.\u201d In recorded patient interviews, a doctor mentions a past \u201cmultiple personality disorder\u201d diagnosis, a reference to the Joker\u2019s \u201csuper-sanity\u201d diagnosis in Grant Morrison\u2019s original Arkham Asylum graphic novel, which offered an explanation for why his personality flits between goofy and sinister depending on the interpretation. The Joker (Mark Hamill) then lies about his childhood, claiming, \u201cI was born in a small fishing village. I always wanted to join the circus, but my father wouldn\u2019t really let me.\u201d Later, when he says, \u201cI hate small confined spaces, reminds me of my childhood,\u201d well, that might have some merit, actually. Asked if he\u2019s lying, he says, \u201cWho knows? I certainly don\u2019t.\u201d Us neither!\n\nBatman: Streets of Gotham, \u201cThe House of Hush\u201d (2010\u20132011)\n\nIn Paul Dini\u2019s story, we meet a foster child named Sonny, who is treated at a clinic by Martha Kane, a kind, matronly figure and Batman\u2019s actual future mother. Sonny is eventually the victim of a chemical laughing gas attack by gangster Salvatore Guzzo, who firebombs the clinic and kidnaps Sonny. The mobsters abuse and molest Sonny, and his broken jaw incorrectly re-aligns into what would become his Jokerish grimace. Sonny-turned-Joker gets his revenge in adulthood, sicking hyenas on Guzzo to eat him alive.\n\nBatman: Zero Year (2013\u20132014)\n\nThis year-long run puts the \u201cJoker\u201d or \u201cTHE Joker\u201d thing to rest, because there\u2019s no real Joker to speak of, at all. Instead, in this chronicle of Batman\u2019s, um, zero-eth year, the caped crusader faces off against a Red Hood, called Red Hood One. If you\u2019ve been reading through this whole piece, you\u2019ll remember the Red Hood backstory as one of the Joker\u2019s first. Then again, this arc never explicitly ties Red Hood One to the Joker. So what tips this over the edge into Probably Joker Origin Story territory? Why, because Red Hood One escapes a Batman face off by jumping into a vat of chemicals, of course!\n\nBatman: Endgame (2014\u20132015)\n\nIn Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo\u2019s Batman: Endgame run of comics, the two reimagine the Joker as an immortal evil entity, potentially Beelzebub incarnate, haunting Gotham City throughout centuries of its history. He\u2019s revealed to be hiding in the shadows in old newspaper photographs, and the like. We have to give Snyder and Capullo props for coming up with a backstory devoid of the words \u201cmobster\u201d and \u201cvat,\u201d but the whole immortal ancient evil clown haunting an American town thing does seem to owe a lot to Pennywise.\n\nSuicide Squad (2016)\n\nMercifully little time is spent on Jared Leto\u2019s Joker in Suicide Squad, although it does mean Viola Davis had to put up with his on-set B.S. for nothing. All we know about the flashy criminal juggalo\u2019s backstory is that he was a mental patient at Arkham Asylum who converted his psychiatrist to a life of lovesick wrongdoing. (Hi, Harley Quinn!)\n\nThe LEGO Batman Movie (2017)\n\nIn my personal favorite Batman property, we don\u2019t get the Joker\u2019s entire origin story, but we do know that he\u2019s shared some pretty good memories with Batman over the years. Now, he just wants his arch-rival to acknowledge that what the two of them share is special. If Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker is relatable to incels and flight risks, LEGO Joker is a true anti-hero for the rest of us.\n\nGotham (2014\u20132019)\n\nFrom the very beginning of its run, Gotham teased the idea of a Joker origin story with the Arkham-bound circus member, Jerome Valeska (Cameron Monaghan). Described by showrunners as a \u201cproto-Joker,\u201d in the show\u2019s fourth season, he died, was resurrected, and died again \u2014 but not before he was able to stage an attack against his twin brother Jeremiah, using laughing gas to infect him with the Joker\u2019s mania (and spark his skin to turn a clownish complexion). If Jerome represented the Joker\u2019s anarchic side, Jeremiah was a calculating schemer. In the same way that the Arkham Asylum arc used multiple personalities/super-sanity to explain away decades of extreme tonal shifts in the character, Gotham used the time-honored TV drama tactic of \u201cbecause twins!\u201d The mythos all came together in the 2019 episode \u201cAce of Chemicals,\u201d in which Bruce Wayne chases Jeremiah into a \u2014 say it with me! \u2014 vat of chemicals! When he resurfaces in a later episode with a hyena laugh and purple suit, he\u2019s in full J mode.\n\nTodd Phillips\u2019s Joker (2019)\n\nWhich brings us to Arthur Fleck, the latest sad clown take on the character, out this week in Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker. Much has been made of the dropped \u201cThe,\u201d but Jack Nicholson\u2019s version also went by the Cher-like one-word Joker moniker. This one seems to have ditched some of the more supernatural, heightened elements of the backstory (sorry, vats of chemical waste purists!) in favor of a gritty, realistic take, incorporating elements from The Killing Joke\u2019s failed comedian story and what appears to be a more grounded look at the character\u2019s psychosis. Arthur is a clown and aspiring stand-up, who lives with and cares for his aging single mother, Penny Fleck, and regularly visits a social worker assigned to him after a stay in a hospital for mental illness. Arthur\u2019s mom, we learn, is a former employee of Thomas Wayne, who believes the man to be a savior for Gotham. We won\u2019t spoil the details of Arthur\u2019s complete backstory here; all in all, we\u2019re meant to believe that a combination of trauma, mental-health issues and continued marginalization pushed him to become the Joker.", "description": "Before Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix unsettle audiences with Joker this Friday, we lay out the various origin stories throughout the character\u2019s history, dating back to the comics in 1940, through Heath Ledger\u2019s Dark Knight performance, to today.", "authors": ["Rebecca Alter"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/30/joker/30-joker-phoenix-lede.w1200.h630.jpg"}
