Three recreation centers were housing evacuees.\n\nAD\n\nFire Chief Ralph Terrazas told reporters that at least eight homes were lost in the blaze and at least five others were damaged. Firefighters \u201cwere literally overwhelmed,\u201d Terrazas said. \u201cThey had to make some tough decisions on which houses they were able to protect. Many times, it depends on where the ember lands.\u201d\n\nThe Southern California blaze joins the massive Kincade Fire, which is marching through more than 66,000 acres of wine country at the other end of the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has declared a statewide emergency.\n\nAD\n\nTerrazas warned people to act quickly if they were in the evacuation zone for the Getty Fire. He noted that the Los Angeles area has experienced several major fires in recent weeks because of strengthened Santa Ana winds and a lack of rain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous season right now,\u201d Terrazas said.\n\nAD\n\nStudents on the Chalon Campus of Mount St. Mary\u2019s University, in the evacuation zone, left campus overnight and are staying on the Doheny Campus, near downtown Los Angeles. Flames, smoke and ash were visible from campus, according to a Twitter user who identified herself as a resident.\n\nSome celebrities tweeted about being evacuated. Los Angeles Lakers player LeBron James wrote that he and his family drove around trying to find somewhere to stay before finally ending up at a place that could accommodate them. Clark Gregg, an actor in several Marvel films, said he and his dogs evacuated to a hotel room. Actor and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said he was evacuated at 3:30 a.m. and urged people in evacuation zones not to \u201cscrew around.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe University of California at Los Angeles and several public schools in the area were closed because of the blaze.\n\nAD\n\nThe J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses visual arts exhibitions, was untouched by the fire but was closed Monday as the blaze approached the edges of the campus. The carefully designed museum has a sophisticated air-filtration system to block pollution, a million-gallon reserve water tank and an evacuation plan, the Los Angeles Times reported in 2017.\n\n\u201cMany have asked about the art \u2014 it is protected by state-of-the-art technology,\u201d the museum tweeted around 8:30 a.m. \u201cThe safest place for the art and library collections is inside.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe California Highway Patrol said the southbound lanes of Interstate 405 were closed on the 6.5-mile stretch between Interstate 101 and Sunset Boulevard.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) told reporters that officials were bulldozing a firebreak on the western side of the blaze to stop it from reaching the Topanga area.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe do expect this to be something that we\u2019ll fight over the next couple days,\u201d Garcetti said.\n\nThe #GettyFire is now moving down the hillside towards the 405 Fwy. I\u2019m all the way on the northbound side, and I can feel the heat from the flames! @CBSLA pic.twitter.com/02bE4VcWNo \u2014 Tina Patel (@tina_patel) October 28, 2019\n\nWinds could gust as high as 70 mph in higher elevations and mountain passes from Santa Barbara to San Diego on Monday, the National Weather Service warned, leading to \u201ccritical\u201d fire conditions. Wind gusts as high as 62 mph were recorded Monday morning.\n\nAD\n\nAny new ignitions, the NWS said, could result in \u201cextreme fire behavior\u201d and rapidly spread, which could force hasty evacuations in heavily populated areas. The strongest winds are expected during the morning and into the early afternoon hours local time, before diminishing considerably late in the day.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The fast-moving brush fire broke out around 2:30 a.m. and a few hours later had spread across 500 acres.", "authors": ["Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "Derek Hawkins", "National"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/93ZHQ4hXbBtfzWbMnRHZHNt8Y3A=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-28-2019/t_f04f18a2446d425e81d9c7cc6a68b6bf_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_00_29_00_Still015.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
