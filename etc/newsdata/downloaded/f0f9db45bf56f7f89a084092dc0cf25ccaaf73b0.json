Tapping into its natural advantage due to the cloudless days and a clear mountain sky in Ladakh, the government is all set to make the mountainous region energy self-sufficient.\n\nAccording to Anand Kumar, secretary, ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) the UT currently has a demand of around 53 MW and new solar plants are planned to be added by the end of 2020 to make the area completely run on renewable energy.\n\nREUTERS/ REPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE\n\nEarlier as part of the government's plan to encourage a business investment boom in the region post the scrapping of Article 370, the Solar Energy Corporation of India, had announced its aim to install 7,500 MW of solar energy in Ladakh by 2023.\n\nUnion power minister R K Singh had said that Ladakh not only had the potential to become renewable energy self-reliant but also can produce enough power that can be sold to other states.\n\nDon't Miss 2.3 K SHARES 22.4 K SHARES 13.2 K SHARES 3.8 K SHARES\n\nBCCL/ REPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE\n\nHowever, Ladakh is not the first UT to go 100 percent, renewable energy dependant. In 2018, Diu had become the first UT to not just produce enough solar energy to meet its needs but was producing beyond that.\n\nThe union territory which has an area of just 42 square kilometres had installed over more than 50 acres and generates a total of 13 megawatts of solar power daily. Out of this, around 3 MW is generated by rooftop solar plants and 10 MW by its other solar power plants.\n\nDiu went from dependent on the Gujarat Power grid to renewable energy self-sufficient in a matter of just three years.", "description": "Ladakh, India's newest union territory could soon be running on renewable energy.
