The team lost its first two games, proving that while Stephen Curry is great, it\u2019s tough for him to do it alone.\n\nBut it might not hurt to try. Some have questioned whether the Warriors should make a better effort to put the ball in Curry\u2019s hands and let him take over games. When asked about that idea, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said it\u2019s not that easy.\n\nShould Steve Kerr crank Steph Curry\u2019s usage? \u201cWe could turn him into James Harden and give him the ball every play, but that\u2019s hard to do. You have to build a team for that..I don\u2019t think the answer is just run a million high screens. We don\u2019t really have the personnel for that.\u201d pic.twitter.com/p0w4ks7Rnb \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) October 28, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAs Kerr explained, you can\u2019t put Curry in a James Harden role immediately. Teams have to be built to sustain that style, according to Kerr. On top of that, Kerr questioned whether Curry would hold up under that usage. Harden has 30 pounds and 2 inches on Curry, according to Basketball-Reference.\n\nWhile Kerr seemed to shoot down that idea, he did admit the Warriors are working on ways to utilize Curry now that he has a much different supporting cast.\n\nIn his full answer to the question, Kerr talked about all the ways the Warriors are working to get Curry more involved on offense. He called it a \u201cchallenge.\u201d Curry has scored 23 points in each of the team\u2019s first two games of the season.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the slow start, the Warriors aren\u2019t going to be terrible all season. Given how successful both Curry and Kerr have been throughout their careers, the pair can probably figure out a way to right the ship before things spiral out of control.\n\nGetting Curry the ball more without overworking him will be the key. It\u2019s up to Curry and Kerr to figure out that balance.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
