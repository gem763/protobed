REUTERS/Jason Cairnduff/File Photo\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian Paralympian Marieke Vervoort died by euthanasia on Tuesday aged 40 after a battle with an incurable and degenerative spinal condition.\n\nVervoort, who won Paralympic gold in the 100 meters wheelchair race in the London Games in 2012, had signed euthanasia papers in 2008 in Belgium, where it is legal, and died in accordance with her wishes late on Tuesday.\n\nVervoort, who also won silver medals in London and at Rio in 2016, was diagnosed with the painful condition as a teenager and retired from competition after the Rio Games. She advocated dialogue on assisted dying in countries around the world.\n\nThe town of Diest in northern Belgium, where Vervoort was born, set up a book of condolence and carried a long message on its website about the woman it called \u201cour Wielemie\u201d, a reference to the wheels of her wheelchair.\n\n\u201cDespite her physical limitations she had a impressive sporting career,\u201d the town said. \u201cMarieke chose euthanasia a few years ago and followed through on her choice on Tuesday evening.\u201d\n\nLocal poet Kristien Nys also penned some lines to the \u201csilver-plated, gold-plated\u201d Vervoort with an iron will and \u201cangelic patience\u201d.
