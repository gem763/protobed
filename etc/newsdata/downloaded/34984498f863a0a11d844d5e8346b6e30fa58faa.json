Because there\u2019s such a world of liking nothing, music that\u2019s not really doing anything.\n\n\u2018I remember having this conversation with my mum about Bury A Friend. We were like, \u201cNobody\u2019s gonna give a f***, because the lyrics are, I want to end me.\u201d\u2018\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018And I really, honestly did not think anyone would care. That\u2019s why this whole ride has been so weird.\u2019\n\nThe duo were interviewing each other for Rolling Stone magazine, and the punk rocker couldn\u2019t help but gush over Billie and her hit.\n\nHe told her: \u2018That song, you\u2019re talking about death. That\u2019s as real as it gets. That\u2019s real, real stuff.\n\n\u2018When I was writing music when I was really young, it was always important to me to feel like I\u2019m writing songs that I can sing 20 years later.\u2019\n\nBillie Joe Armstrong is a Billie Eilish fan (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThe 47-year-old explained: \u2018A song like Basket Case, it\u2019s a song about losing your mind. As you get older, it gets more and more real. And that\u2019s what creates longevity.\u2019\n\nFollowing the release of the Bad Guy hitmaker\u2019s latest album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, Billie became the youngest ever female solo act to top the charts.\n\nAt the time she thanked her fans, saying: \u2018I appreciate you making WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? the #1 album in the UK so much.\n\n\u2018We worked really hard on this album. Thank you for the love!!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt 17 years, three months and 18 days old, Billie overtook Joss Stone \u2013 now 31 \u2013 as the youngest woman to top the Official Albums Chart.\n\nIt was a close call, however, as Joss\u2019 2004 record Mind, Body & Soul reached Number One when she was 17 years, five months and 28 days old.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
