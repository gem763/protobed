They\u2019re Not Enough.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nIndia\u2019s stocks rose again Monday, building on last week\u2019s gains after the government\u2019s surprise decision to slash corporate tax rates. But for those gains to persist, investors may need to see more reforms to bolster India\u2019s struggling economy and to address its structural problems, including its vulnerable fiscal situation.\n\nThe iShares MSCI India ETF (INDA) is up 1.6%, building on the 5.7% gains on Friday. But year-to-date, the ETF is up just 0.5%, underperforming the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), which is up 7% so far this year, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has gained 16% in 2019.\n\nOver the weekend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump had a lovefest in Houston. Many draw similarities between the two leader\u2019s approach and policies, and India\u2019s latest tax cut is likely to draw comparisons to Trump\u2019s own cuts. But it isn\u2019t clear the tax cuts will offer the same juice to India\u2019s markets as the U.S. corporate tax cut did for the S&P 500.\n\nBefore the tax cut announced last week, investors had been relatively glum. The economy has been stuck in a slump; capital spending and private investment has been lackluster and credit growth has been squeezed as India\u2019s banking sector deals with a nonperforming loan problem. Investors have grown wary at what they see as socialist political messaging from the government, writes Shumita Deveshwar, director of India research at TS Lombard in a note to clients.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to cut its corporate tax rate from 30% to 22%\u2014lower than the expected 25%\u2014and bringing India\u2019s tax rate down toward the world average from among the highest contributed to the biggest single-day gain in India\u2019s stock market last Friday. The question is if it is enough to turnaround investor sentiment.\n\nIn a note to clients, Citi\u2019s India economics and equities strategy team said the move could reset earnings for the companies it covers by as much as 8% to 9% from full year 2020 onward and described it as \u201cthe most ambitious reforms in a while.\u201d The analysts said it could bolster sentiment among downbeat investors. \u201cWhile the tax cuts raise fiscal deficit concerns and could pressure rates, we believe some of concerns about the government\u2019s appetite to address the growth slowdown may be assuaged for now. Markets will likely expect more big ticket announcements going forward, which will likely continue to support sentiment,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nCiti increased its overweight on financial services, noting that most financials had a tax rate of 35%. The picture is more mixed for consumer staples, but companies Citi identified as potential beneficiaries included Asian Paints (500820. India), Nestl\u00e9 India (500790. India), Britannia, Colgate-Palmolive India (500830. India) and Jubilant FoodWorks (533155. India).\n\nCiti\u2019s S&P BSE Sensex target for fiscal year 2020, which ends in March, is 40,500, just slightly higher than the last close at 39,090.\n\nThe hope is the tax cut unleashes private investment, but Citi\u2019s analysts cautioned clients it could take a while until the effect trickles down to consumption, requiring the markets to be \u201ca bit patient.\u201d\n\nThose looking at the bigger picture also see reason to not get too excited: \u201cGovernments in India usually undertake drastic reform measures when their backs are up against the wall, and the sharp cut on corporate taxes from 30% to 22 is proof of just that,\u201d according to Deveshwar. \u201cThe tax cut will worsen government finances that already looked vulnerable due to low tax collections, leading to worries over macroeconomic stability despite the market\u2019s ebullience over this long-awaited reform.\u201d\n\nWrite to Reshma Kapadia at reshma.kapadia@barrons.com", "description": "India\u2019s stocks rose again Monday, building on last week\u2019s gains after the government\u2019s surprise decision to slash corporate tax rates.
