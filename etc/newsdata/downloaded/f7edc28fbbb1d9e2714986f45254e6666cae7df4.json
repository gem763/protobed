Flights were responsible for 2.4 percent of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2018 \u2014 a figure expected to grow more than threefold by 2050.\n\nIn the face of aviation\u2019s rising emissions problem, the United Nations created the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The initiative aims to help airlines cancel out the environmental impact of growth in international flights after 2020, by making airlines buy carbon emissions reduction offsets.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not just on airlines to make a difference. If you want to be an eco-friendly traveler, carbon offsets are a top option for you, too. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\n1. What are carbon offsets, and how do they work?\n\nCarbon offsets offer a way to balance out your pollution by investing in projects that reduce emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If you\u2019re taking a long-haul flight from New York City to Paris, for example, you can purchase a carbon offset to account for that specific environmental impact.\n\nSuch offset projects can vary widely.\n\n\u201cIt ranges from things like planting trees to improved forest management, where a timber company will allow trees to grow longer and increase the amount of carbon sequestered in the forest,\u201d says Peter Miller, a program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group. \u201cIt can be capturing of greenhouse gas emissions coming out of a landfill. It could be paying a rice farmer to adopt different practices that reduce the amount of methane coming out of their rice paddies.\"\n\n[United wants Gen Z customers. Gen Z wants discounts and carbon offsets.]\n\nOffsets are measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent. You can figure out how much carbon dioxide-equivalent you\u2019re on the hook for by using online calculators, either from an independent source or a project\u2019s website. Next, you would find a carbon offset project to support to essentially cancel out your pollution.\n\nSome projects directly help the environment and humans simultaneously, such as building cookstoves in rural communities abroad that only require half the amount of wood as a traditional stove. Less wood means less toxic smoke in the house, as well as reduced carbon emission and spared forests.\n\nAs far as accounting for your carbon pollution goes, it doesn\u2019t matter what the carbon offset project is as long as it matches your carbon output.\n\n\u201cBy developing projects and investing in these projects to reduce emissions or increase sequestration, there\u2019s a benefit to the climate,\u201d Miller says.\n\n2. Why should travelers buy carbon offsets?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be traveling to be concerned about your carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 anyone can buy a carbon offset. But because travel is particularly toxic to the environment, travelers may feel more compelled to account for their participation in the pollution.\n\n\u201cPeople underestimate how much emissions are associated with air travel,\u201d says Seth Wynes, a climate change researcher at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and the author of a forthcoming book on climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy on a global level to say, \u2018Okay, air travel is only a small portion of global emissions depending on how you look at it, and therefore it\u2019s not a giant contributor.\u2019 But if you do fly, then each flight that you take is likely to be a large chunk of your personal carbon footprint in a year.\u201d\n\nIn terms of carbon emissions, Wynes says, flying is a really inefficient way to travel, and prolific flying should be seen as a precious resource \u2014 not a necessity. But canceling your honeymoon to Greece or missing that board meeting in Arkansas is not always an option. So, when flights are unavoidable, buying carbon offsets is an easy, low-cost way to negate your impact.\n\n\u201cOffsets can be an important and valuable part of an overall carbon emission reduction strategy,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWe all have a collective responsibility to avoid the looming climate crisis. Some people have chosen to not fly anymore as a way to avoid contributing to emissions in the first place. That\u2019s not the answer that many people will adopt.\u201d\n\n[This giant hotel chain is getting rid of single-use toiletries to cut plastic waste]\n\n3. How can travelers determine which programs are legitimate?\n\nWhile buying carbon offsets to make up for your travel pollution is a noble effort, it can be pointless if you\u2019re supporting the wrong program. And there are bad ones out there. It\u2019s smart to be skeptical of an industry that has very little regulation and a major lack of transparency.\n\n\u201cAnybody or their brother can say, \u2018I\u2019m doing an offset project in my backyard to reduce emissions\u2019 and go out there and sell people credits for their reduced emissions,\u201d Miller says. \u201cYou have a willing buyer and a willing seller. And there may be zero credibility there.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t get duped. Before you get your credit card out, make sure the project is transparent and clearly defines how the emission reduction works and how it\u2019s accounted for.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to ensure that emissions that get reduced by these projects are verifiable and are forever,\u201d Wynes says.\n\nTo combat that issue, a carbon offset project should have reserves to account for future reversals. (For example, if you\u2019re paying to plant a tree and the tree dies, the program should have a plan to make up for the carbon deficit.) The program also needs an objective regulatory body.\n\n\u201cA credible, fair project will have third-party verification,\u201d Miller says. \u201cYou have a project implementer who does the project according to the protocol and an independent third party who reviews the implementation, reviews the project and ensures it is compliant with the requirements.\u201d\n\nEmission reductions should be tagged so that each metric ton gets a unique serial number \u2014 without one, the same emissions reductions could get sold over and over. You also need to look for projects that are truly additional, meaning it wasn\u2019t some already-existing effort now being advertised as a carbon offset.\n\n\u201cAn additional project means that the only way the project would exist is because of the funding from the carbon markets,\u201d says Marisa de Belloy, the chief executive of Cool Effect, a San Francisco Bay area 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization. \u201cIf I\u2019m legally required to capture methane in my landfill site, I can\u2019t sell carbon projects because I had to do it anyway, so it wouldn\u2019t be an additional project.\u201d\n\n[What is \u2018green travel,\u2019 anyway? A beginner\u2019s guide to eco-friendly vacation planning.]\n\n4. How do I buy carbon offsets?\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided that you would like to buy a carbon offset, browse sites such as Green-e, Gold Standard and de Belloy\u2019s Cool Effect to find a reputable project to support. There are a lot of programs out there to choose from, so pick one that strikes you personally. Do you want to support a program in a place you like to visit? Or maybe one in your home state? Once you\u2019ve narrowed down your options, refer to the above advice on what to look for to guarantee a quality purchase.\n\nTo assure more bang for your buck, consider a project that does more than just reduce greenhouse gas emissions. You may be paying for the environmental side of the project, but it can have humanitarian benefits at the same time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole range of forest projects that can have tremendous benefits in terms of the local ecosystem, native species or water storage,\u201d Miller says. \u201cAn urban forestry project can be really helpful in terms of quality of life or jobs for disadvantaged communities.\"\n\n5. Are carbon offsets tax-deductible?\n\nYes. If you\u2019re supporting a project that\u2019s registered as a 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization, you can make your purchase tax-deductible. That means you get to reduce your impact on the environment and maybe ease your tax burden at the same time.\n\n6. Are carbon offsets the only way to be a greener traveler?\n\nNot at all. There are many small steps that you can take to nibble at the edges of the problem, including choosing direct flights and avoiding sitting in first or business class, as those spacious seats take up room that could have fit more passengers. You can also encourage your company to invest in videoconferencing options to replace expensive and environmentally taxing business flights.\n\nIn the end, though, \u201creally the best thing that you can do is not fly and find good alternatives to that,\u201d Wynes says. \u201cTake a vacation or staycation around where you live, or a local vacation where you take a trip by train is great.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThis igloo-themed hotel is set to open at the North Pole \u2014 for $100,000 per person\n\n\u2018Green\u2019 travel stunts by airlines can\u2019t erase the environmental impact of flying\n\nEurope\u2019s \u2018flight shame\u2019 movement doesn\u2019t stand a chance in the U.S.", "description": "If you want to be an eco-friendly traveler, carbon offsets are a top option.
