Taking an early look at Oscars 2020 frontrunners Read more\n\nCharlize Theron stars as Megyn Kelly and Nicole Kidman as Gretchen Carlson, two of the women who took on Ailes, played by John Lithgow, with accusations of sexual harassment. Margot Robbie also stars as a fictional producer, built from a number of real-life women.\n\nThe film, from Game Change and Austin Powers director Jay Roach, was unveiled over the weekend in Los Angeles to Oscar buzz, particularly for Theron\u2019s reportedly transformative role as the controversial TV figure.\n\n\u201cIt was very important to me that we set out on a road of whatever the greater truth is and stayed on that road and that we never veered and tried to make her sympathetic or to try and persuade people to like her or to think that she was a hero or a good person, that we just told the truth of what her story was,\u201d Theron said after the screening. She also added: \u201cI have no interest in playing heroes.\u201d\n\nIn preparation for the script, Oscar-winning The Big Short screenwriter Charles Randolph conducted numerous interviews with ex-Fox staffers, many of whom decided to violate their NDAs in order to provide background information. The film was given the green light before both the election of Donald Trump, who has been accused of sexual harassment and abuse by 25 women, and the start of the #MeToo movement but the makers have noted the timeliness of the story\u2019s retelling.\n\nRandolph has stressed the importance of focusing on misconduct within an organisation that\u2019s responsible for some amoral tactics. \u201cNo woman, no matter what you think of her politics, deserved to be harassed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis resonates way beyond that.\u201d\n\nThe project follows on from Showtime series The Loudest Voice which detailed the rise of Fox News and the eventual fall of Ailes, played by Russell Crowe. But the show was met with mostly middling reviews.\n\nBombshell will be released in the US in December and in the UK in January.", "description": "Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie star in true story of how Roger Ailes was brought down by sexual harassment allegations", "authors": ["Benjamin Lee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47fbe773569de0ff515b8536238807d2b5995295/0_349_1296_777/master/1296.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=308235f56a9f95cb732316fa63076d61", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
