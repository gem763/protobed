But the Florida resident fears his vote might return him to jail.\n\nTyson, 63, owes court-ordered fines and fees for three felony convictions, one for robbery, two for theft, all decades old. Under a Florida law that went into effect July 1, he must pay those penalties before casting a ballot or risk being prosecuted for voter fraud.\n\nTyson searched court records, first on his own, then with the help of a nonprofit legal advocacy group. They say that because Florida has no comprehensive system for tracking such fines, the documents don\u2019t make clear what he owes. The records, viewed by Reuters, show potential sums ranging from $846 to a couple thousand dollars related to crimes he committed in the late 1970s and 1990s. Tyson says he won\u2019t risk voting until Florida authorities can tell him for sure.\n\n\u201cUntil there is clarity, as much as I want to vote, I won\u2019t do it,\u201d Tyson said.\n\nThe Tampa pastor is now a plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging the payments law, which was crafted by Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature and signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, also a Republican. The law came just months after Floridians approved a ballot initiative restoring voting rights to more than 1 million felons who have completed their sentences; that change to the state\u2019s Constitution created a potentially huge new crop of voters in a critical battleground state ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in June by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Brennan Center for Justice, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Legal Defense and Educational Fund, alleges the fees requirement defies the will of Florida voters and amounts to an illegal poll tax on newly enfranchised Florida felons, many of them minorities.\n\nBut another argument is shaping up to be central to the plaintiffs\u2019 case: Florida has no consolidated system for determining what felons owe or certifying that they have paid up. It\u2019s a situation that ex-offenders say makes it virtually impossible for them to prove they are eligible to vote.\n\nThose claims are bolstered by state election officials who say they can\u2019t calculate what felons owe, either, according to a Reuters review of 7 depositions, emails and other internal correspondence from voting administrators submitted by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys as part of the lawsuit.\n\nFlorida has no centralized database where records of court-ordered fines and fees - and any payments of those penalties - are stored, election and court officials say. To get that information, felons typically must search documents in courts where they were convicted, be they federal or state, inside or outside Florida. Records have been found to be incomplete, contradictory or missing, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys say.\n\nWith the Feb. 18 deadline to register for the state\u2019s 2020 presidential primary approaching, the issue is taking on urgency. An estimated 436,000 felons have fees to settle before they can vote, according to a study by University of Florida political scientist Daniel Smith, an expert witness for the ACLU. The study was based on court data and Department of Corrections records.\n\nThe stakes are high. Florida commands 29 of the 538 electoral votes that are used under the U.S. Electoral College system to select the American president. In Florida and most other states, the candidate who places first in the popular vote \u2013 even if just by a hair \u2013 wins all the electoral votes. Florida has a history of tight elections and contested outcomes.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 attorneys say Florida has shifted all responsibility for compliance with the new payments law to ex-offenders, who risk prosecution if they get it wrong. The state contends the legislature merely implemented the constitutional amendment as it was written on the ballot.\n\nThe legislation, known as SB 7066, \u201csows seeds of confusion,\u201d said Leah Aden, deputy director of litigation at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. \u201cIt will chill participation.\u201d\n\nSome of the state\u2019s 67 county elections supervisors - the public servants who ultimately decide which felons get culled from the rolls and which can stay - expressed concern in their depositions and to Reuters about making mistakes that could invite challenges to future election results.", "description": "Clifford Tyson wants to help choose America\u2019s next president.
