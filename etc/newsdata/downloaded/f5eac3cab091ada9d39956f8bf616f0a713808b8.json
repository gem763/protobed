We have a 200 plus year tradition of a peaceful transfer of power. When presidents have moved on, it had peaceful transfers of power between parties.\u201d\n\n\u201dThis president now is using the most incendiary language trying to incite people by using language like a coup, like treason,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat this person is doing is trashing our ideals, our values, and our norms.
