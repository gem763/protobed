That\u2019s the common definition of recession.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA separate, widely followed index drawn from purchasing managers showed September\u2019s contraction in manufacturing was the steepest since June 2009, with production, inventories and new orders all falling.\n\nAnd after adding nearly half a million jobs in the prior two years, which Trump frequently stressed in hard-hat rallies throughout the Midwest, manufacturing employment has stalled.\n\nInstead of healthy job growth, layoff announcements have surged this year, especially in battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. Friday\u2019s jobs report for September showed a slight drop in total factory jobs.\n\nManufacturing today accounts for only about 10% of economic activity, and so far, the overall economy and employment in the U.S. are still growing. But the pace has slowed considerably this year. The faltering industrial sector has started to crimp businesses in the transportation and warehousing sectors. And there are growing worries of spillover effects in the larger services sector and broader economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if the nation can avoid a recession next year, a manufacturing downturn could prove to be politically damaging for Trump, who rode to the White House on enthusiastic support from blue-collar workers in key states and on his promise to revive America\u2019s coal, steel and other industries.\n\nAlthough manufacturing constitutes a far smaller portion of the whole U.S. economy than it once did, it remains very important in a handful of swing states that Trump narrowly won in 2016 \u2014 including Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the months before the 2016 election, it didn\u2019t help Hillary Clinton\u2019s prospects that manufacturing was on the skids and factory jobs were shrinking, thanks to a drop-off in energy-related investments, a strong dollar and lackluster demand for American goods in emerging economies.\n\nSome of those same factors are again weighing against American industry. But analysts and business leaders say the single biggest restraint on manufacturing this year has been of Trump\u2019s own making: excessive use of tariffs and his trade wars with China and other countries.\n\nOf utmost concern has been Trump\u2019s confrontation with China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Many American firms have major operations there \u2014 both manufacturing, such as smartphones, and sales, such as motor vehicles. And U.S. companies rely on China for a big chunk of their sales and profits.\n\nU.S. businesses have put off spending on major equipment and buildings as they\u2019ve sought to look through the fog of a swirling trade conflict marked by Trump\u2019s haphazard tariff actions and off-and-on negotiations.\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials concluded high-level talks Friday in Washington, and afterward Trump announced that the two sides had reached a partial, tentative agreement on trade. He called it a \u201cPhase One deal\u201d that includes a big increase in Chinese purchases of U.S. farm goods. In return, he agreed to halt a planned tariff hike that was to take effect next week on some Chinese goods. The agreement, which must still be formalized in the coming weeks, isn\u2019t expected to have a major effect on manufacturing anytime soon.\n\nJim Springer, chief financial officer of Industrial Nut Corp. in Sandusky, Ohio, doesn\u2019t need the Fed and a bunch of economists to tell him that manufacturing is in recession. He can see it in his 111-year-old family business making locknuts and other fasteners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpringer, 58, who runs the company with his father and three brothers, remembers when orders took off at the end of 2016. Sales surged 30% in 2017 and went up an additional 14% last year, to just shy of the company\u2019s record-high sales of $20.25 million in 2006.\n\nIt\u2019s been downhill since the first quarter, however, as the company\u2019s largest customers, such as Caterpillar Inc., the big manufacturer of tractors and construction trucks, started to scale back. Sales at Industrial Nut are expected to fall about 10% this year, and Springer says tariffs are a big culprit. They\u2019ve hurt the company both by making raw materials more expensive and by slowing sales in China for companies such as Caterpillar, and those effects have trickled down to parts suppliers like Industrial Nut.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of the loss we\u2019re seeing from tariffs far outweighs the benefits of the tax cuts,\u201d Springer said, referring to the GOP-led move to shave the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% starting in 2018.\n\n\u201cThat was pro-business, and it was nice,\u201d he added, but \u201cthe tariffs are just too blunt of an instrument.\u201d\n\nLike manufacturers across the country, Industrial Nut has recently begun to reduce overtime hours for workers, and Springer says the company is managing labor costs also through attrition and retirement of its aging workforce.\n\nSandusky County, some 60 miles west of Cleveland along Lake Erie, has a population of about 59,000. Manufacturing accounts for roughly 40% of the county\u2019s private employment and has been shedding jobs since the middle of last year. In 2016, Trump won the county with 58% of the vote, even though it went to Obama in both 2012 and 2008.\n\n\u201cOur shop floor is divided,\u201d Springer said of the company\u2019s 40 hourly employees, who are represented by the United Steelworkers. \u201cSome people love him, the \u2018fake news\u2019 things ... and there are those who don\u2019t trust him.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019ll be very difficult [for him] to get reelected in a recession. Then again, the alternatives aren\u2019t very appealing from a pro-business perspective.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost analysts see U.S.-China tensions remaining high in coming months. And that probably means little relief on tariffs and continued uncertainty for businesses, which will keep manufacturing limping along.\n\nMichael Hicks, a regional economist at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., said there was a greater than 50% chance of a national recession in the next 12 months. Indiana has the country\u2019s largest concentration of manufacturing, accounting for some 22% of the state\u2019s economy \u2014 about double the U.S. average.\n\nTrends in recreational vehicles, made in northern Indiana, have been a good indicator of recent recessions, and shipments are down about 20% this year, Hicks said. By year\u2019s end, he predicted, it won\u2019t be just Indiana\u2019s manufacturing jobs that will be down from a year ago but employment overall for the state.\n\n\u201cIndiana has never had a year where employment dropped for the year and the U.S. was not in recession,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t likely to lose Indiana in 2020; it has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate only five times since 1900, most recently in 2008, when Barack Obama narrowly beat Mitt Romney.\n\nBut industrial activity in Indiana is deeply intertwined with manufacturing in nearby states that are not rock-solid Republican \u2014 especially Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin, which Trump took by a mere 22,748 votes in 2016, the narrowest of his vote margins in any state, is second to Indiana in its reliance on manufacturing.\n\nWisconsin has one of the state\u2019s lowest jobless rates in the country, just 3.1% in August. Manufacturing payrolls, however, have been mostly declining since September and are down for the year, as the trade war and other forces have hurt manufacturers in industrial machinery, metal fabrication, paper products and food processing.\n\n\u201cTariffs are one of the reasons that our production costs have increased, along with increases in the costs of raw materials, labor and freight,\u201d said Donna Parke, marketing and services manager at Tramontina, which in the summer closed its cookware plant in Manitowoc, Wis., and consolidated it with factories in Brazil. The shutdown eliminated 145 jobs.\n\nLike Tramontina, much of Wisconsin\u2019s manufacturing operations and workforce are in rural areas, which, along with better-than-expected support in Milwaukee suburbs, helped Trump squeak out a win over Clinton.\n\nCharles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, said that, for Wisconsin voters in 2016, manufacturing and the overall performance of the economy took a back seat. Voters were more concerned about cultural conservatism and felt pessimistic about the future of the country, factors that made Trump more appealing to them.\n\nBut Franklin noted that, in late August, a substantially greater share of Wisconsin\u2019s registered voters said they expected the economy over the next year to get worse rather than better. It was only the second time in more than 50 surveys conducted since 2012 in which economic pessimism was stronger than optimism for the future.\n\nThe only other time was in January, also this year, around the time of the federal government shutdown.\n\n\u201cThis represents a weakness of a central part of Trump\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cWe may not be in a full-blown recession, but enough that that could play a role in 2020.\u201d", "description": "After Trump's vow to boost industry and two years of gains, manufacturing is in recession, threatening the livelihoods of many of his supporters.", "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Don Lee Covers The U.S.", "Global Economy Out Of Washington", "D.C.
