It\u2019s the best feeling on Earth.\u201d\n\nJohan Botha from Centurion, who broke his neck in a diving accident on 14 September, says he and his family are deeply grateful that he\u2019s been able to return home after a successful surgery saved him from being paralysed.\n\nHe\u2019ll soon be celebrating his 40th birthday at home.\n\nOn 14 October, surgeons at the Kalafong Hospital in Pretoria performed the operation. They had to get to Johan\u2019s damaged vertebrae from the front \u2013 in other words, through his neck. They had to move his larynx out of the way, so it might be weeks before Johan\u2019s voice has recovered.\n\nWe\u2019re communicating via WhatsApp and a telephone call for which his wife, Anneke, is present.\n\n\u201cIt was a huge success, thank God. I spent two days in high care and was then moved to a general ward. I was discharged on Tuesday (22 October),\u201d he tells YOU.\n\nHe\u2019s still wearing a neck brace, is on three kinds of painkillers and still has a long rehabilitation process ahead of him. But compared to the days after the accident when he was in excruciating pain and the month spent in hospital waiting for surgery, he says, \u201cI feel like a new person.\u201d\n\nJohan, a facilities manager at a home for the disabled, previously told YOU how the accident happened. He and his family were at a holiday resort near Pretoria when he dove head-first into a murky swimming pool and hit his head against the bottom. The water was only a metre deep and he weighs 125kg, so he hit his head hard.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe broke a vertebra in his neck, and the impact ruptured one of the shock-absorbing cushions between his vertebrae. Other vertebrae lower down in his spine, as well as his sternum, were cracked. The damage caused dangerous swelling in his spine which led to pressure on his nerves.\n\nHe was on morphine for the excruciating pain in his shoulders and arms. His middle fingers were numb. Doctors were amazed that he\u2019d walked into the emergency room of a private hospital and hadn\u2019t been paralysed.\n\nAfter he was stabilised he was transported to Kalafong, a state hospital, where he waited a month for the surgery. It was a long month, he says, as he needed to be kept as still as possible and wore a neck and shoulder brace. \u201cThe smallest bump could paralyse me.\u201d\n\nThe reason for the delay was a long waiting list and a shortage of space in the high-care unit. But Johan and Anneke have nothing but praise for the care he received at Kalafong.\n\n\u201cThey treated him very well and the high-care unit was awesome,\u201d Anneke says. \u201cHe called me at 5am on the morning of the surgery and said I shouldn\u2019t come then, \u2018but please be here when I wake up\u2019.\u201d She says she counted down the hours in the waiting room.\n\n\n\n\n\nSurgeons repaired Johan\u2019s vertebrae with synthetic bone, plates and screws to relieve the dangerous nerve pressure.\n\n\u201cThey were worried about whether the feeling and functioning of his limbs would be affected,\u201d Anneke says. But when they checked afterwards there weren\u2019t any problems.\n\n\u201cHe had to use a walking frame but he\u2019s stable on his feet now, though sometimes he still gets dizzy and struggles to get up from the bed.\u201d\n\nJohan has to go back to hospital on 5 November for a follow-up examination. If the doctors are satisfied, his rehabilitation will be planned.\n\nIt could take about six months before he\u2019s completely healed. Because he\u2019s the breadwinner of the family, this puts a strain on their finances.\n\nIn the meantime, he says, \u201cI\u2019m just so happy to be home with my wife and children. I can barely describe the feeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur focus now is on getting him healthy again,\u201d Anneke adds.", "description": "\u201cI just walked into my home.
