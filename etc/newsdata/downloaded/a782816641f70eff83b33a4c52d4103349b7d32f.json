The security guards at the market were called and they were chucked out.\n\n\"They've also been banned from the market.\"\n\nIn the clip, tempers boil over as one of the women, wearing a black jacket, points her finger in another's face as they start shouting.\n\nPunches then fly as the pair lunge at each other as an older lady - dubbed the \"white coated wonder woman\" online - tries to break up the brawl by getting in between them.\n\nShe manages to cool things down as the two would-be boxers seperate.\n\n(Image: Snapchat)\n\nSecurity was then called and the pair were chucked out and banned from the Aberdeen Indoor Market in the city centre.\n\nCommenting on the video on Twitter , @byshannonc said: \"Reason 816282 on why not to go in to the market.\"\n\nWhile Maria Tamkun wrote: \u201cHahahaha imagine us getting our nails done and seeing that.\u201d\n\nAnd @fitabootit posted: \u201cExcellent peacekeeper skills by white coated wonder woman.\u201d\n\nNow the salon have told how they fear their small business will be given a \"bad name\" following the incident.\n\nUzma added: \"The fight had nothing to do with our salon.\n\n\"We're a small business struggling to get by and things like this just give us such a bad name.\n\n\"The incident was very loud and a lot of people who noticed it came in to our store, including other shops, asking us about it as if it's our fault.\n\n\"We work really hard to bring customers to our store and it hurts us. We don't want people seeing the viral video and thinking it happened because we had done something.\"\n\nPolice Scotland said they had no reports of the incident.", "description": "Footage of the scrap was taken at the nail and beauty salon Ai to Ai in Aberdeen market, Scotland - and showed the women in a heated exchange before they start fighting", "authors": ["Nicholas Keyden", "Image", "Snapchat"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20752040.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_beauty-salon-brawl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
