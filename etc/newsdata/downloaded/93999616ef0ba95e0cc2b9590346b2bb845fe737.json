The government would need to work closely with the private sector to first scope out the size of the cyber threat, Mr Wellsmore said, then prioritise what should be done about it.\n\n\"Offensive measures are certainly the remit of government, but the size and scope of the problem can't be managed by government alone,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Matt Warren, deputy director of the Deakin University Centre for Cyber Security Research and Innovation, said that only government agencies should be allowed to mount cyber counter-offensives. Often, he argued, only such agencies were capable of the \"cyber attribution\" that has to take place before counter measures can be launched.\n\nCyber attacks were often launched via unwitting third parties, so it was important to use the Australian and overseas intelligence communities to get to the real source of an attack for launching a counter attack.\n\nCyber warfare should be on an equal footing to traditional warfare, and so government has a role to play. \u2014 Nick Abrahams, Norton Rose Fulbright\n\n\"It should be in the realm of government. It acts as a deterrent for state-sponsored hackers, so they know they can't just attack systems in Australia and think there won't be any consequences,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Australian government has a duty of care to protect all of Australia, including our citizens, including our corporations,\" Professor Warren said. Laws permitting the government to hack back against overseas threats would be in line with what the US government is already doing, he said.\n\nNick Abrahams, global head of technology and innovation at the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, said it was important that the government stepped up and helped industry against cyber offensives.\n\n\"A lot of the malware that's coming through now is incredibly sophisticated and it's clearly being targeted by state actors,\" he said.\n\n\"If the government has checks and balances in place, if it can't act without having due process, cyber warfare should be on an equal footing to traditional warfare, and so government has a role to play.\"\n\nEven so, there were plenty of legal issues that would need to be addressed before the government stepped in to defend Australian companies.\n\n\"At what level do we move from it being an individual organisation's obligation to defend itself, to the government stepping in and regarding it as a matter that's akin to military defence?\" Mr Abrahams asked.", "description": "Security experts back the Morrison government's plan to allow cyber spy agencies to aggressively intervene on behalf of Australian companies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.0408%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_94/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5975a588528f73542f655b9538509a9388673d23", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
