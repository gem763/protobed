Bratt says that the number of lawn signs supporting Hehr were an indicator of the upset.\n\n\"Everywhere we looked, there was a majority of Kent Hehr signs versus Joan Crockatt ... That was telling people, 'No, this is going to be different this year,' and you could visibly see it,\" he said.\n\nDuane Bratt and Brown's research suggests that signs must be on private, not public property, to have any bearing on election outcomes. (Geoff Robins/Canadian Press)\n\nAccording to Brown, who runs an independent polling firm, lawn signs may have also predicted the outcome of the 2012 provincial election in Alberta.\n\nThough the Wildrose Party was expected to take the most seats in the provincial legislature, the Progressive Conservatives snuck up from behind, she recalls.\n\nLawn signs, she believes, told the story before the ballot box.\n\n\"People were telling me that Wildrose lawn signs were coming down across the province, and as a pollster, that was kind of the canary in the coal mine that I missed,\" she said.\n\nLeaving her home earlier this week, Brown noticed a neighbour who previously erected signs for both the Liberal and Green parties had since removed the Liberal sign.\n\n\"You'd think that they are decided voters, but sometimes the signs change,\" she said.\n\nLimited in scope\n\nBrown and Bratt's research may be the only formal look at the impact of lawn signs on Canadian elections. As a result, the research has its limitations.\n\nIt reflects just one region of the country, and looks only at urban, rather than rural, ridings.\n\n\"[In] rural communities where you have these long country roads, I'm not sure what difference this sign is going to make,\" he said.\n\nSigns also must be on private \u2014 not public \u2014 property to have any bearing on election outcomes, Bratt adds.\n\nWhat's more is that the research looked only at what lawn signs can tell us about how an individual person may vote. Whether or not a greater number of signs for one candidate over another sways undecided voters is unknown.\n\nDespite living in an age where campaigns are partially fought on social media, both Brown and Bratt believe analog lawn signs have a long life ahead of them.\n\n\"It's a subliminal impact as you're driving down the road, as you're taking your evening walk with the dog, you see these signs,\" Bratt said.\n\n\"There's a lot of value in low tech.\"\n\nTo hear the full interview with Janet Brown and Duane Bratt, download our podcast or click Listen above.", "description": "If you really want to know who will win the upcoming election, just look at the signs in your neighbourhood, say Calgary-based researchers Janet Brown and Duane Bratt.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5318153.1570824108!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-candidates-expenses-20160403.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
