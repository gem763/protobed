Nearly 800 people have been injured.\n\nSeveral explosions were heard early Thursday in the Green Zone, the central Baghdad district that houses foreign embassies and government buildings, but no casualties were reported.\n\nThe US-led military coalition fighting against the Islamic State (Isil) called the violence \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and \u201curged all sides to reduce tensions\u201d.\n\nAdel Abdel Mahdi, Iraq\u2019s prime minister, ordered an indefinite curfew in Baghdad from 5am Thursday. \u201cAll vehicles and individuals are totally forbidden to move in Baghdad,\u201d the order stated.\n\nDemonstrators gesture at a protest over unemployment, corruption and poor public services, in Baghdad Credit: REUTERS/Thaier al-Sudani More\n\nTravellers to and from Baghdad airport, ambulances, government employees in hospitals, electricity, and water departments, and religious pilgrims are exempt from the curfew, the statement said.\n\nIgnoring the curfew order, protesters once took to the streets and clashed with security forces on Thursday. Iraqi troops fired live rounds into the air to try to disperse demonstrators from Baghdad\u2019s Tahrir Square.\n\nAmid the chaos, Hussein Adel Madani, a cartoonist, was shot dead along with his wife, Sara, by masked gunmen who stormed their house in Basra early on Thursday, officials said. Their two-year-old daughter, Zahra, was not harmed.\n\nThe couple had taken part in protests but it was not clear if their deaths were directly linked to the unrest. A number of activists have been assassinated in Basra this year.\n\nThe Iraqi government has virtually cut off the internet in an effort to stop protesters spreading news and images of the demonstrations on social media.\n\nUpdate: #Iraq has now been largely cut off from the world for 12 hours following the outbreak of mass-protests; real-time network data show ~75% of country including #Baghdad remain offline (excl. autonomous regions); curfew now in effect \ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd https://t.co/7GF42YLDWUpic.twitter.com/kOB4DQvI9V\n\n\n\n\u2014 NetBlocks.org (@netblocks) October 3, 2019\n\nTests by NetBlocks, an internet freedom group, found that around 75 per cent of the country was without internet. Applications and messaging services like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter have all been blocked.\n\nTwo explosions were reported in the Green Zone around dawn on Thursday. It was unclear what the cause but the area was hit by two rockets last week.\n\nHours earlier security forces sealed the Green Zone \u201cuntil further notice\u201d out of concerns that protesters may try to storm the area. It was only re-opened to the public in June for the first time since the 2003 US invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe protests represent a severe challenge to Mr Abdel Mahdi, who took office only a year ago. In an effort to stem the protests he announced new measures to help graduates find work and promised to force foreign companies to hire more local workers.\n\nAn Iraqi protestor gestures in front of security forces during a demonstration against state corruption, failing public services and unemployment Credit: HUSSEIN FALEH/AFP via Getty Images More", "description": "Iraq\u2019s government imposed a curfew on Baghdad and largely shut off the internet on Thursday as it struggles to reimpose order after three days of bloody protests that have left 19 people dead.
