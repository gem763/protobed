Even as tens of thousands were celebrating National Day in China, demonstrators in the territory of Hong Kong marched through the streets in its 17th week of protests.\n\nIn Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping, addressed the nation and pledged that \"No force can stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation forging ahead.\"\n\nThe military parade, with all its pomp and pageantry, involved more than 15,000 military personnel who took part in celebrations commemorating the Chinese Communist Party's 70 years of rule.\n\nOn display were 160 aircraft and 580 pieces of military equipment, including drones and missiles. The Dongfeng 41, a nuclear-capable missile, was also unveiled during the military parade. The Associated Press quoted analysts as saying the weapon could reach the U.S. in 30 minutes.\n\n\"It looks like this is almost entirely, if not entirely, a military show of strength,\" Shirk told CNBC's Street Signs.", "description": "The 70th anniversary celebrations, which boasted one of Beijing's largest military parades, took place as China faces economic and political challenges.", "authors": ["Stella Soon"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106157296-1569915371238gettyimages-1172686251.jpeg?v=1569915423", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
