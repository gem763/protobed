Nationwide, Tesco & more on This is Money's podcast", "language": "en", "text": "What's the difference between loyalty and inertia? Do we get too little reward for the former and show too much of the latter when it comes to shopping and banking?\n\nThat's the question Simon Lambert, Lee Boyce and host Georgie Frost tackle in the podcast this week.\n\nIt comes as Tesco \u2013 one of the original loyalty scheme pioneers \u2013 revealed its new paid-for Clubcard Plus, costing \u00a37.99 per month.\n\nMeanwhile, Nationwide Building Society has also announced it is scrapping its hugely popular loyalty savings accounts held by 1.6million people.\n\nWhich are the firms and organisations the team feel some loyalty too - and what are the ones they stick with out of sheer laziness?\n\nAnd with another small energy firm going bust, should we in fact be staying 'loyal' to some of the established giants for peace of mind?\n\nElsewhere, we look at a study comparing the costs of buying and renting a home claiming the former could leave you \u00a3350,000 better off: do we finally have conclusive evidence?\n\nAlso, when you buy shares in a company, do you need to check what bosses of the business are up to? Are they themselves buying into their own company \u2013 and if not\u2026 why not?\n\nWe also run the rule over statistics showing how many cars there are with more than 250,000 miles on clock with a full MOT. The team reveal the best workhorse cars, the high-milers they've owned and ask listeners to tell us below: what is the biggest mileage you've racked up on a car?", "description": "What's the difference between loyalty and inertia when it comes to Britons and the banks, supermarkets, energy suppliers and other financial firms we use?", "authors": ["This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
