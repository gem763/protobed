It stopped immediately.\n\n'I said, 'Cardinal Newman, did you make the bleeding stop?'. There was a burst of roses that filled the air... I knew I was cured.'\n\nIt was the second miracle needed for his canonisation.\n\nPrince Charles added: 'In the age in which he attains sainthood his example is needed more than ever.'\n\nHe added: 'He could advocate without accusation, could disagree without disrespect and perhaps most of all could see differecnes as places of encounter rather than exclusion.'\n\nA service for Cardinal Newman, who died at 89 in 1890, will be held at Westminster Cathedral next week.\n\nThe last Briton to become a saint was Scottish priest John Ogilvie, who was hanged and drawn in 1679 at 36. He was canonised in 1976.", "description": "Prince Charles, 70, will be at the ceremony in the Vatican, where he will meet Melissa Villalobos, 42, a lawyer from Chicago who claims she experienced a miracle after praying to Newman.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline", "Hannah Dawson For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/10/19622590-0-image-a-28_1570872490972.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
