This implies investors expect Prosus to try again with a higher offer.\n\nProsus has tabled a \u00a34.9 billion bid to buy Just Eat (Just Eat)\n\nThe firm revealed the 710p bid is just the latest preliminary offer it had put forward, with 670p and 700p being proposed earlier and rebuffed.\n\nIn July, Just Eat announced plans to merge with Dutch delivery firm Takeaway.com in a \u00a39billion deal.\n\nThe Prosus offer provides a 20 per cent premium on the 594p per share implied value of the Takeaway.com proposal.\n\nProsus said it has decided to make its bid public to give shareholders an opportunity to consider the offer.\n\nNetherlands-listed Prosus, which is majority-owned by South African firm Naspers, already has a significant investment portfolio in the food delivery sector, including iFood in Latin America, Swiggy in Indian and European business Delivery Hero.\n\nChief executive Bob van Dijk, said: 'We believe our global experience and resources can help Just Eat to achieve its significant potential.\n\n'We believe that Just Eat's customers and restaurant partners will ultimately benefit from more delivery options, greater restaurant choice as well as improved service and delivery speeds driven by the combined group's expertise in product and technology innovation supported by increased capital investment in the business.'\n\nIn July Just Eat announced plans to merge with Dutch delivery firm Takeaway.com\n\n'We presented this idea to the board of Just Eat, in good faith, but we have been unable to engage constructively in what we see as a compelling proposition for Just Eat shareholders,' he continued.\n\n'As an investor and operator with significant experience in this dynamic and competitive sector, both globally and on a local level, we believe we are best placed to support Just Eat through its next phase of essential investment.'\n\nJust Eat said: 'The board has considered the terms of the Prosus offer and believes that it significantly undervalues Just Eat and its attractive assets and prospects both on a standalone basis and as part of the proposed recommended all-share combination with Takeaway.com'\n\nOn Monday, Just Eat posted rapidly growing sales in the third quarter despite a backdrop of 'softer consumer spending'.", "description": "The 710p per share offer puts Just Eat at the centre of a bidding war, with the company already in the midst of a merger with its Dutch rival Takeaway.com.", "authors": ["Alex Sebastian For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
