Of course it has not.\u201d\n\nShauna, who also mentioned she had recently paid off her iPhone, said that she was in disbelief and began to cry, and then went into Chick-fil-A to ask for a manager.\n\n\u201cThe manager comes over to talk to me and is very friendly but unsure how to help,\u201d wrote Shauna. \u201cJust then another employee behind her says he is going to grab a grab-stick and a mirror to try and help \u2014 without hesitation, and in his uniform, he lays on the ground and attempts to locate the phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t see it either and we both realize the worse. It has in fact fallen dead smack in the middle, down the actual drainage hole,\u201d she added. \u201cSo we go back inside where we go to a table as my son is hungry and I still can\u2019t believe what has happened.\u201d\n\nShauna said that the Chick-fil-A employee \u2014 whose name is Seth \u2014 then notified her that he had refunded her order. \u201cThanking him, I tell him he didn\u2019t have to do that, but he tells me it was no problem as I\u2019m clearly already having a bad day,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe customer said that Seth then joined her and her son in the booth, where he called the county to ask for assistance.\n\n\u201cThey hang up on him,\u201d said Shauna, who added that when they later went back out to the parking lot, they noticed that the storm drain cover was not bolted down. Shauna then describes what happened next.\n\nSo we try to lift it. It\u2019s really heavy so he does most the lifting and ends up slicing his finger open. After running in quickly to clean the wound, he is able to remove the cover and there at the very bottom of the drain hole is my phone. After trying to reach it with his grab-stick then dropping his stick, he tells me it\u2019s a manhole for a reason and he is going down. He then climbs down into the hole and retrieves my phone which miraculously is not broken or wet. I was so thankful I freaking hugged him. Not only did he slice his finger and was filthy from laying on the ground and climbing in the hole, I find out he had actually just gotten off shift and was still willing to help me.\n\n\u201cSo this is Seth. Turns out he is also the store\u2019s Digital Marketing Director,\u201d said Shauna. \u201cHe is also now my hero and favorite Chick-fil-A employee.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs he was about to climb out of the hole he asked me to snap a picture so he could show his girlfriend what he did at work today,\u201d she added. \u201cJust another day at Chick-fil-A.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "A Chick-fil-A employee in Stafford, Virginia, climbed down a storm drain to retrieve a phone that a customer had accidentally dropped in the sewer. \"This is Seth,\" said the customer, \"He is also now my hero and favorite Chick-fil-A employee.\"", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Chick-fil-A-employee-climbs-down-manhole-for-customer-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
