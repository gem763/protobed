According to the documents, TMZ reports, Aaron was talking via FaceTime with his twin sister, Angel, on August 7 when he told her he \u201cwas diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar 2 years ago.\u201d When Angel asked Aaron if he ever heard voices, he allegedly said, \u201cI have thoughts of killing babies,\u201d and \u201cI think about killing Lauren Kitt,\u201d Nick\u2019s wife, who is pregnant with their second child.\n\nTMZ also reports that Aaron\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Lina, was present and when she asked Angel, \u201cHow do you think I feel with him sleeping with a sword next to him?\u201d Aaron become upset and said, \u201cShut up Lina, you are next on my list.\u201d Police supposedly visited the home the day after the FaceTime conversation for a welfare check after being alerted by a family member.

He repeated the claim via Twitter on Tuesday night.\n\nI never threatened anyone. I\u2019m appalled by this and don\u2019t ever wish to speak to them again. They\u2019re trying to 5150 me.
