Carlson then took aim at Smith.\n\n\u201cApparently our daytime host who hosted Judge Napolitano was watching last night and was outraged by what you said and, quite ironically, called you partisan,\u201d Carlson exclaimed in a rather jovial manner.\n\nThe Fox News star went on to air a clip of Smith not-so-subtly calling out Carlson for letting a \u201cpartisan guest\u201d attack Napolitano without being challenged. \u201cAttacking our colleague, who is here to offer legal assessments on our air in our work home, is repugnant,\u201d Smith added.\n\n\u201cRepugnant!\u201d Carlson mockingly shouted. \u201cNot clear if that was you or me, but someone was repugnant!\u201d\n\nPlaying another clip of Napolitano reiterating his view that Trump broke the law by seeking election assistance from a foreign leader, the primetime Fox star insisted that \u201cunlike maybe some dayside hosts, I\u2019m not very partisan.\u201d\n\nAfter accusing Smith of being partisan, the conservative talk show host opened the floor for diGenova to continue to rail against Napolitano\u2019s analysis. \u201cI was very truthful last night,\u201d diGenova said.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t seem honest to me when a host, any host on any channel, including this one, pretends that the answer is obvious,\u201d Carlson stated. \u201cThat there is ironclad consensus about what the answer is when there, in fact, isn\u2019t, when it\u2019s a subjective question. That\u2019s not news, is it? That\u2019s opinion.\u201d\n\ndiGenova, meanwhile, insisted he was absolutely right to claim Trump has not committed any crimes because he\u2019s a former U.S. attorney before taking some additional shots at Napolitano.\n\n\u201cHe is entitled to feel that way,\u201d the Trump-supporting lawyer declared. \u201cHe is a disappointed office seeker. He didn\u2019t get the seat on the Supreme Court that he desperately wanted and he has been mad about it ever since. He showed it yesterday and he showed it so many times over the last year it\u2019s pretty embarrassing actually for me. You know, I love the guy. God bless him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do too,\u201d Carlson replied. \u201cWe invited him on tonight by the way. It makes people cynical when you dress up news coverage, when you dress up partisanship as news coverage and pretend that your angry political opinions are news. You know, people tune out.\u201d\n\nThis wasn't the only time we saw friendly fire on Carlson's show Wednesday night. Earlier in the program, Fox News reporter Trace Gallagher said \u201cmost legal analysts, even on the liberal media outlets, acknowledge it would be very difficult to make a case that President Trump broke the law.\u201d This would, however, contradict Napolitano's assessment, as well as a number of lawyers and legal analysts Smith also cited on Wednesday to show Trump broke the law.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
