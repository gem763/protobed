The Eagles trailed by at least 10 points in each of their four games and still managed a 2-2 record\u2014which keeps them well within reach of the NFC East-leading Dallas Cowboys.\n\nBased on the upcoming schedule, the division race should heat up over the next month. Dallas hosts the Eagles on Oct. 20 for Sunday Night Football. Plenty could be on the line as long as the Eagles build upon Thursday's 34-27 victory over the previously unbeaten Green Bay Packers.\n\n\"We needed this at this point of time,\" Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins said, per the Delaware News Journal's Martin Frank.\n\nThe fortitude to overcome obstacles is merely the first step of the Eagles' early-season turnaround. A victory at Lambeau Field on a short week says a lot about a team, especially an injury-depleted one. Sure, the \"any given Sunday\"...er, Thursday...mantra can be used to explain how a resurgent Aaron Rodgers fell short of leading Green Bay to a victory. But the Eagles roster is coming together after a slow start, and the trend should continue as weeks pass.\n\nBefore going any further, the likelihood of the Eagles overtaking the Cowboys in short order is reliant on each team's upcoming schedule.\n\nPhiladelphia thwarted the Packers and now has 10 days to prepare for the hapless New York Jets, who will likely still be without franchise quarterback Sam Darnold. From that point, the Eagles face the Minnesota Vikings, whom Green Bay already beat.\n\nThe 3-0 Cowboys, meanwhile, must overcome the New Orleans Saints this weekend, which is no easy task. Then, they host the Packers and meet the Jets before the big showdown against Philadelphia. A quick reminder: Dallas' first three opponents own a combined 1-8 record. Unlike the Eagles, Jerry Jones' franchise is searching for its first signature win of the season.\n\nRich Schultz/Getty Images\n\nFor that fateful meeting to mean as much as possible, the Cowboys must lose at least one game while the Eagles win both of theirs. And for Philadelphia to win its next two and be ready for the Dallas showdown, it will have to build upon Thursday's performance.\n\nThe Eagles dominated in the trenches, especially on the offensive side of the ball. The team's front five created gaping holes in the running game and didn't allow a sack.\n\nLeft tackle Jason Peters, left guard Isaac Seumalo, center Jason Kelce, right guard Brandon Brooks and right tackle Lane Johnson dominated at the point of attack. They created lanes trucks could drive through and jump-started the league's 17th-ranked rushing attack. Philadelphia averaged a meager 3.6 yards per carry through three games. Jordan Howard and Miles Sanders finally found their footing, though, which makes the Eagles dangerous.\n\n\"[Jordan Howard] brings the power and I bring the speed,\" Sanders said after totaling a career-high 72 rushing yards, per Frank.\n\nThis year's 53rd overall pick struggled in his first three appearances. Sanders' vision and decisiveness were questionable. But the first-year back didn't have to worry about much in his fourth contest, because anyone could have run through the holes his O-line opened. The performance serves as a confidence-builder.\n\nDylan Buell/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, Howard finally worked his way into a bigger role and provided a fantastic performance. The offense's hammer carried the ball 15 times for 87 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Howard also had three receptions for 28 yards and another score. In doing so, he became only the second visiting player in Lambeau Field history with two rushing touchdowns and a receiving touchdown, per ESPN Stats & Info.\n\nThe ground-and-pound approach took pressure off quarterback Carson Wentz and the passing game. The entire unit became more efficient overall. Yes, Wentz missed a couple throws. But he made up for those misses with three touchdown passes. As a whole, the offense scored all four times in the red zone.\n\nThe group received a boost with Alshon Jeffery's return. Jeffery missed last week and most of Week 2 with a calf injury. Philly's WR1 caught three passes for 38 yards and a tough touchdown through traffic.\n\nOffensively, the Eagles will get even better once DeSean Jackson returns from an abdomen injury. His presence opens up the entire offense. Right now, the Eagles lack a vertical threat. Jackson stretches the field, which will make Philadelphia's new-found running game and underneath work by Jeffery and tight end Zach Ertz even more effective.\n\nInjuries have beset the defense as well. The secondary is in shambles. To be more accurate, cornerback is a major concern area. The team's top cover corner, Ronald Darby, continues to deal with a hamstring injury. Unfortunately, his replacement as CB1, Sidney Jones, suffered a hamstring injury Thursday while trying to (unsuccessfully) cover Davante Adams, who set a career high with 180 receiving yards before leaving the game with an injured toe. Late in the fourth quarter, Avonte Maddox was stretchered off the field after absorbing a helmet-to-helmet hit.\n\nStacy Revere/Getty Images\n\nThe Eagles are far from perfect. The franchise's vaunted defensive front secured only two sacks before Thursday's affair. Defensive end Derek Barnett made a crucial play with a strip-sack of Rodgers. Still, the entire unit managed only two quarterback hits. Rodgers' pocket presence, escability and mobility were reasons that number was so low. Even so, the defense made two goal-line stands.\n\nAs the season progresses, the Eagles must create more pressure, especially if they're down their top two corners for any period of time.\n\nLike Philadelphia, key Dallas performers are banged up. All-Pro guard Zack Martin is nursing a back ailment. Wide receiver Amari Cooper has issues with his foot and ankle, though he returned to practice Thursday, according to D210 Sport's Brianna Dix.\n\nThe Cowboys have an early edge in the standings, but the NFL season is a marathon. It's crucial to build on what worked the previous week and jettison what didn't work.\n\nThe Eagles are now trending in the right direction. Their strong running game and dominant front made them more efficient Thursday. As Philadelphia's health improves, the entire squad will receive a boost and re-enter the NFC East race in earnest.\n\nIf the Cowboys don't stay on track, the Eagles could very well fly right past the current division leader.\n\nBrent Sobleski covers the NFL for Bleacher Report.
