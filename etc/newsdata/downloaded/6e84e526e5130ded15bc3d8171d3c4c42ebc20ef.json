After a tackle was made, Incognito came running over, joined the pile-up, then shoved a Bears player's helmet into the ground for no apparent reason.\n\nIncognito was flagged for unnecessary roughness and the 15-yard penalty knocked the Raiders out of field goal range.\n\nHere was the play:\n\nIncognito was one of several big-name additions for the Raiders this offseason, many of which have proved ineffective. Antonio Brown was cut before the regular season after a months-long drama. Last week, linebacker Vontaze Burfict was suspended for the rest of the regular season for a helmet-to-helmet hit.\n\nIncognito has a checkered history, including the infamous Dolphins bullying scandal, and many in the NFL world were not surprised by the penalty in Week 5.\n\nAgainst the Bears' stingy defense, the missed opportunity for three points may come back to haunt the Raiders.", "description": "Richie Incognito cost the Raiders three potential points with an unnecessary penalty, something that could come back to haunt them against the Bears.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9a28a872fd8227c900dc9b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
