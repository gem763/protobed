That which is relevant for people of today as it was to those of the past will likely be relevant to those of the future as well. The old technologies survive \u201cbecause the new will be replaced by the newer,\u201d and for something to fail, \u201cmake sure it would have been of no interest to someone in the past,\u201d says Taleb.\n\nHere, he emphasizes the importance of time itself, given that it can produce and detect fragility, as well as break that which is fragile, while that which survived \u201chas some resistance to random events.\u201d The scholar finds that this enables negative forecasting, as it\u2019s easier to predict collapses than emergences, given that the former will likely not affect the old, but will affect the \u201cshaky\u201d new, with some modernistic items being replaced.

Even those who disagreed with the possibility of it disappearing, seem to agree that it\u2019s fragile.\n\nMeanwhile, back in January 2018, in his foreword to the book by Saifedean Ammous, The Bitcoin Standard, Taleb wrote that Bitcoin is an excellent idea that fulfills the needs of the complex system, not because it\u2019s a cryptocurrency, but because there\u2019s no owner, thus, no authority that can decide its fate. He was also the person who popularized the term \u201cthe black swan risk,\u201d which can take a number of shapes, can\u2019t be predicted, has severe consequences, and is comprised of three attributes: rarity, extreme impact, and retrospective predictability, as Taleb explained.\n\nConnected to Taleb\u2019s prediction that the world may not be seeing fiat for much longer, Oswald Gr\u00fcbel, a German banker who was CEO at Credit Suisse and then CEO at Swiss bank UBS, said that \"Negative interest rates are crazy. That means money is not worth anything any more. [...] As long as we have negative interest rates, the financial industry will continue to shrink,\" quotes The Sidney Morning Herald.\n\nHere are some of the numerous opinions on Taleb\u2019s list shared in the Cryptoverse:\n\nSeems overall correct for \u201clikely to break.\u201d One issue: Fiat currency? Agree it\u2019s fragile, but the reaped rewards are so disproportionate to those who bear the risk that gov\u2019t now & future would keep feeding at the trough, no? \u2014 Magnus Stout (@StoutMagnus) October 7, 2019\n\n__\n\nI think it means fiat as \"non scarce means of exchange\", that's relatively new (Bretton Woods) \u2014 Miguel Prados (@MiguelPradosR) October 8, 2019\n\n__\n\nFiat money is not a new idea and has withstood long history. Why is it fragile and will break now/Y+30? I'm not saying I'm long Fiat. But, I don't see how it fits in your argument. \u2014 \u0279\u01dd\u029e\u0279\u0250d \u028d\u01dd\u0279pu\u0250 (@andrewparker) October 7, 2019\n\n__", "description": "Fiat money is likely to break within the decade, predicts Nassim Nicholas Taleb, an essayist, scholar, and former risk analyst, famous for his book on the extreme impact of rare and unpredictable events, The Black Swan.", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d9/cb2bfe72c6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
