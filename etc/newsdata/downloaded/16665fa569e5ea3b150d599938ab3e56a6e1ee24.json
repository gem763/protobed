Maybe it's because I am not a spokesperson for a condom brand, we were not being careful,\" she said in jest.\n\nAnita admitted that she even took some medicine and ate food that were considered a risk to pregnancy in the early months, as she didn't know she was carrying a baby at the time.\n\n\"That's why I announced my pregnancy very late. I was worried that all the medicine that I had taken was going to cause problem with the foetus. But I have taken extra precaution since then and hopefully everything will go smoothly,\" she said.\n\nAnita added jokingly that it is a miracle that the baby is still fine despite her previous situation.\n\nAsked if she has plans to add another following the third one, the actress stated that she has considered requesting her husband to do a vasectomy, although whether or not he will listen to her is up to him.\n\n(Photo Source: Mingpao)", "description": "The actress says she nearly risked losing her baby after taking meds risky to pregnancy", "authors": ["Heidi Hsia"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Atu0CLcor4hVhVkGKi0ZfQ--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ybrand.cinema.com.my/8ffa0d82fab7cb16412728be622c2450", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
