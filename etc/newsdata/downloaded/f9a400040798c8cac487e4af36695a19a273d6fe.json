Some jurists fear sequestration may cause jurors to rush deliberations.\n\nSequestration is most common when there is heavy media coverage and heightened public interest.\n\nKemp denied a motion to exclude evidence from Guyger\u2019s texts and phone calls and a motion for a mistrial from Guyger\u2019s attorneys who claimed the Dallas district attorney, John Creuzot, defied a gag order by giving an interview about the case to a local TV station over the weekend.\n\nThe prosecutor Jason Hermus said he planned to display a photo of Jean in the courtroom as prosecutors make their case, to show that he was \u201ca living, breathing human being prior to this event\u201d.\n\nThe DA\u2019s office re-examined the case after the public protests and a grand jury in late November indicted the former police officer on murder charges, with the maximum punishment of life in prison.\n\nGuyger, who had been on the force for over four years, walked into Jean\u2019s apartment after returning from a shift and was able to enter because Jean\u2019s door was slightly ajar, according to Texas law enforcement officials.\n\nAfter the incident, she was placed on administrative leave and fired days later.\n\nGuyger\u2019s defense had pushed for a change of venue, arguing in court last week that media coverage had been so intense their defendant could not get a fair trial.
