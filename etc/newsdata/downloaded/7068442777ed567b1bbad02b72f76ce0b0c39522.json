New York won the opener 7-0 at Minute Maid Park behind Gleyber Torres\u2019 hitting and Masahiro Tanaka\u2019s pitching.\n\nVerlander topped the majors with 21 wins this season and is 14-8 with a 3.20 ERA in postseason play. But he wasn\u2019t at his best in his last start, chased in the fourth inning at Tampa Bay when the Astros had a chance to clinch the AL Division Series. That game came when Verlander started on three days\u2019 rest - he\u2019d done that just once before, after a rain-shortened outing in the 2011 playoffs.\n\nVerlander will be on regular rest when he faces James Paxton. The New York lefty made his first postseason start last week in the ALDS opener against the Twins and was driven out in the fifth inning.\n\nTAKE A BREAK\n\nStephen Strasburg and his Washington teammates get a day off before resuming the NL Championship Series with a 2-0 lead. Strasburg starts Game 3 on Monday night at Nationals Park against Jack Flaherty and the Cardinals.\n\nStarters Max Scherzer and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez and the Washington relievers allowed a total of four hits while winning the first two games at Busch Stadium.\n\nDEAD-BALL OCTOBER\n\nCardinals manager Mike Shildt and St. Louis\u2019 analytics department are wondering what happened to the juiced baseball. Shildt said the team\u2019s front office has found the ball is flying 4 \u00bd fewer feet on average in the postseason, raising more questions about the makeup of the baseballs after hitters clubbed a record 6,776 home runs in the regular season - a rise attributed to unusually far-flying balls.\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t leave much doubt, says data journalist Rob Arthur. He was among the first to suggest tweaks to the ball may have caused home runs to spike as early as 2015, and he thinks something is off with this year\u2019s October model, too. Arthur published a story Thursday at Baseball Prospectus showing the postseason balls have more air resistance than the regular season balls, according to data pulled from MLB\u2019s own tracking system. Arthur projected home runs were down 50% through Wednesday\u2019s games compared to what would have been expected in the 2019 scoring environment.\n\nMajor League Baseball released a statement Thursday claiming the balls haven\u2019t changed since the regular season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors Sunday:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/alds_astros_rays_baseball_74493_c0-224-5384-3364_s1200x700.jpg?ec1f638be172f79dbfa20c7062963d2df37fa533", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
